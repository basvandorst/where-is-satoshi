This came from a conversation I had with a friend of mine.  This guy is usually
on the ball when it comes to technology, so I'll ask him for a refrence.  He's
fairly reliable when it comes to discovering weaknesses in systems, and is
particularly knowledgeable in unix and OS/2, so this sort of thing is something
that is of concern to him as well.  He's worked with a lot of comm stuff as
However, it could wind up as a rumor, so let me ask him and find out where
he found out.

@_subject: Clipper: Denning v Barlow Debate on AOL 
This is a captured chat from the Time Magazine, Time Odeon Online Forums.
On America Online, my handle is RayDude.
I unfortunately didn't get into the confrence in time to catch its
begining. However as there's a transcript of every such confrence,
I'll post that up as well.  As I just go this immediatly after the
confrence, there's no *OFFICAL* transcript posted online, however
when one becomes available, I will send it here...
(In the AOL "audience" you can only chat with those in your own
row.  All messages preceded by (6) are by those in my row.
This is kind of messy, but you can still follow all the simultaneous
discussions with a bit of effort.)
You can send me internet mail at rarachel if you
wish, or RayDude however I prefer the photon machine.
Barlow1    : improved traffic analysis. Content is less important              than context, and most agents will
Barlow1    : support this.
Shuddup    : (6) I really don't accept the traffic analysis              argument. That's too much work!
COUNTMINDO : (6) i just don't like having a product forced on me,              we don't all have to buy FORD's if we want to
COUNTMINDO : (6) deal with the government
RPTime     : Another question from the audience.  JCMaille asks...
Barlow1    : By the way, I'm not seeing my responses. Am I still              online?
Question   : Does the government have a constitutional right of              access to my personal communications?
RPTime     : Yes, John you are!
RayDude    : (6) RE: Traffic analysis: bet on it.  It can be done              and very easily over the internet as is.
Kyrahn     : (6) or as if gun controll has taken semi automatic              guns and or automatics RayDude    : (6) It will be much easier when the cable companies              give you a net-feed.
RPTime     : Dr. Denning, why don't you go first?
Barlow1    : hello?
Shuddup    : (6) But why bother with TA? Cost high, payoff low.              Most of us are not evil!
MegSaint   : (6) Shuddup, since when has inefficency ever stopped              the governmnt from doing something?
Barlow1    : hello?
DDenning   : The Supreme Court ruled that wiretaps with a court              order are Constitutional.
Barlow1    : hello?
DDenning   : At one time, communications were not even protected              under the
RayDude    : (6) To cite an example, my girlfriend went on              vacation to HK. I'm not Chinese, but because I called              HK,
COUNTMINDO : (6) JPB is having troubles
DDenning   : 4th Amendment.  The government could wiretap without              a court order!
Shuddup    : (6) Right, but there;s almost always a reason - even              if it is just to prove that we can...
DDenning   : Now a court order is required.
RayDude    : (6) AT&T sent me an offer to call HK for much less.              This was half a year AFTER I called Hong Kong!!!
Kyrahn     : (6) crazy
RayDude    : (6) AT&T keeps track of EVERY call you make.  If              telephones have this much traffic analysis,
PhilipED   : To put the question another way, do citizens have a              right to use powerful encryption?
RayDude    : (6) so will the info highway!
Shuddup    : (6) Sure, but again - why?
DDenning   : Right now there are no laws preventing the use of any              encryption.
Shuddup    : (6) AT&T sells phone time. They have a reason.
DDenning   : Clipper is voluntary.  You can still use something              else.
RPTime     : We have to apologize.  John Barlow has temporaily              lost his connection...
MegSaint   : (6) I think we lost JPB! Shuddup    : (6) BIG BROTHER! PARANOIA!
RayDude    : (6) No, they are REQUIRED to keep records by the FCC,              another branch of the government. Kyrahn     : (6) I've lost my mind :>
Shuddup    : (6) :-)
PhilipED   : Dr. Denning, in your opinion...
COUNTMINDO : (6) they got him
RayDude    : (6) hehehe!
PhilipED   : would a law outlawing powerful encryption be              unconstiotutional?
Shuddup    : (6) >:-(
Kyrahn     : (6) it's not paranoia when they really plan to do it
Shuddup    : (6) The problem is to figure out why. Never ascribe              to malice what can be explained by stupidity!
MegSaint   : (6) Or beauracracy, which may be the same thing
DDenning   : I don't think so.  But that doesn't mean it will              happen.
Shuddup    : (6) Right..
COUNTMINDO : (6) they want to keep the status quo, but who's to              say that that is right?
PaulR42    : (6) Can Clipper break PGP2.3?
RayDude    : (6) Keep in mind that the NSA no longer have the              Russians to spy on.  So they need new targets. Us!
RPTime     : John Barlow is back with us.  Sorry for the              interruption!
MegSaint   : (6) Did she mean she doesn't think there will be a              law or she doesn't think it will be unconst.?
Shuddup    : (6) Yeah, but why? What do we got? RayDude    : (6) They need to be entertained, so they'll spy on              everyone they can citing all sorts of rants
PaulR42    : (6) Welcome back, John.
COUNTMINDO : (6) hooray back from the beyond
Shuddup    : (6) ;-)
PhilipED   : Barlow, Denning just said she didn't think a law              banning powerful encryption would be unconstitutional
RayDude    : (6) about "What if the drug dealers, terrorists,              child molesters, and pornographers" get strong              crypto?
PhilipED   : What do you say?
Barlow1    : Hi folks. Don't know what happened. Gald to be back
Kyrahn     : (6) kinda like algebra  let stupidity=Beauracracy
PhilipED   : Gald indeed!
MegSaint   : (6) Crooks already *have* strong crypto!
RayDude    : (6) Nope, as far as the cypherpunks can tell PGP is              still strong.  DES has been broken.
Kyrahn     : (6) multiply by x agencies
PaulR42    : (6) Use the RSA scheme?
Barlow1    : Actually, I believe that our current export embargoes              are a violation of the 1st Amendment
RayDude    : (6) That's the point.  Crooks already have strong              crypto, but the rest of us wont if UncleSam gets his              w
RayDude    : (6) way
Barlow1    : which specifically speech without regard to the              manner of speech. If we could restrict manner
COUNTMINDO : (6) and the crowd began chanting CANTWELL CANTWELL              CANTWELL
Kyrahn     : (6) I am Not a Crook
Barlow1    : of speech, it would be constitutional to require that              everyone speak English. Which of course it isn't
MegSaint   : (6) Cantwell? Explain please
PaulR42    : (6) BTW, PGP is classified as munitions.
RayDude    : (6) Neither am I.  But face it, the NSA doesn't want              anyone to have strong crypto except themselves.
PhilipED   : John, can you make the case why ordinary law-abiding              citizens need powerful encryption?
Kyrahn     : (6) so is any encryption program
COUNTMINDO : (6) CANTWELL is the rep. who is trying to pass a bill              to do away with the export law on encryption
RayDude    : (6) Yet, you can FTP PGP from Finland. You can import              IDEA from outside the country too. Munitions indee
COUNTMINDO : (6) classifying it as a munition
Kyrahn     : (6) importing is o.k.
Barlow1    : Because it is in the nature of digitally networked              communications to be quite visible. Everytime
MegSaint   : (6) Thanks, good informtation. Where have I been?
Kyrahn     : (6) just don't try to send it
Barlow1    : we make any sort of transaction in a digital              environment, we smear our fingerprints all over
Barlow1    : Cyberspace.
RayDude    : (6) If you guys want, you can subscribe to the              cypherpunks mailing list
Kyrahn     : (6) 'cause they can throw you in jail
COUNTMINDO : (6) no thanks
COUNTMINDO : (6) heavy traffic
RayDude    : (6) by sending a message to              cypherpunks-requests with subscribe in the              subject and body.
PaulR42    : (6) What's the address?
Barlow1    : If we are to have any privacy in the future, we will              need virtual "walls" made of cryptography.
MegSaint   : (6) RayDude, what's the address?
RayDude    : (6) Beware, that you'll get over 70 messages a day!
Kyrahn     : (6) black "ice"
PaulR42    : (6) And the NSA on your tail.
RayDude    : (6) Do you guys know about "SecureDrive?"
COUNTMINDO : (6) holy gibson batman
Kyrahn     : (6) nope Kyrahn     : (6) flatman
RPTime     : Another audience question...
Question   : isn't like the gun argument? if guns are outlawed              only criminals will have guns, well if
Question   : clipper is standardized, won't criminals be the ones              NOT using it?
RayDude    : (6) SecureDrive is a DOS program that will give you              an encrypted hard drive using the IDEA cypher. Very
RayDude    : (6) secure.
RPTime     : Dr. Denning?
COUNTMINDO : (6) hey that's my question
Kyrahn     : (6) not grock dos MegSaint   : (6) Wow!
Kyrahn     : (6) am on mac
RayDude    : (6) I sent about 6 questions so far.. haven't seen              any yet.. must be slow..
Kyrahn     : (6) patience
DDenning   : If Clipper becomes the de facto standard, then it              will be the chief method
RayDude    : (6) Re: MAc Secure drive: no worries, I'm writing one              for the Mac. Send me a message in two monts.
MegSaint   : (6) There are over a hundred people here
Kyrahn     : (6) cool
RayDude    : (6) two months... sorry
PaulR42    : (6) Is it my imagination, but are the main              participants fading out....?
DDenning   : of encryption.  That would be what you'd get at Radio              Shack.  What criminals
RayDude    : (6) Cool, but very hard to write... Re: fading out,              no, were just talking too fast. :-)
DDenning   : use will depend on what is readily available and what              their cohorts are using.
MegSaint   : (6) Do we have better connections than the net              heavies?
COUNTMINDO : (6) such as PGP
Kyrahn     : (6) Raydude-> at AOL?
RayDude    : (6) As cypherpunks we are planning to give out free              disks with crypto at the next PC Expo in NYC. If
DDenning   : Both parties of a conversation have to use the same              thing.  Criminals also talk to
PaulR42    : (6) Cool, RayDude!
RayDude    : (6) any of you dudes are in NYC at the time, look us              up. :-)  (RayDude or rarachel
DDenning   : a lot of people outside their immediate circle -              e.g., to buy goods and services. Kyrahn     : (6) cool
DDenning   : Also, they can be quite stupid at times.  But the              main thing is that criminals will
Kyrahn     : (6) you can reach me here on AOL
COUNTMINDO : (6) cypherpunks mbone conference, watch for it soon
DDenning   : not be able to take advantage of the SKIPJACK              algorithm as a way of concealing
DDenning   : their  conversations.  This is the whole point.  It              is not to catch criminals.  It is
DDenning   : to allow people access to a really high quality              algorithm in a way that someone
COUNTMINDO : (6) what bullshit!
MegSaint   : (6) Countmindo, "cypherpunks *mbone* conference? I              don't get it.
DDenning   : cannot use it to conceal criminal activity.
Kyrahn     : (6) it gets deeper all the time
Barlow1    : The gun analogy is excellent up to a point. I can't              for the life of me imagine why we would think that
PaulR42    : (6) Where's the shovel?
COUNTMINDO : (6) cypherpunks are putting together an mbone              conference, video and audio over the net
Barlow1    : even a stupid criminal would use Clipper if something              else were available. And when I talk
MegSaint   : (6) In other words, anyone not using Clipper will be,              de facto, a crook.
Barlow1    : to people in the administration their big hobgoblin              is the *nuclear-armed" terrorist. Any fanatic
Kyrahn     : (6) that's it RayDude    : (6) In other words, crypto except for clipper will be              illegal!
Barlow1    : smart enough to assemble and detonate a nuclear              device is going to be smart enough to download
COUNTMINDO : (6) yeah de-facto illegal
Barlow1    : PGP from a bulletin board somewhere.
RayDude    : (6) I wish I had a sparc station to join the mbone              conf.. hope one of you will have transcripts.
Kyrahn     : (6) red flags for anyone not using clipp you wings
PaulR42    : (6) Right on, John!
Barlow1    : Also, I'd like to point out that the gun analogy              doesn't go the whole distance. Crypto is by its
RayDude    : (6) Fuck clipper, we have to spread PGP far and wide              making it tough to outlaw it.
COUNTMINDO : (6) cool he kicks dennings ass off my question!!
Barlow1    : nature a purely *defensive* technology. You can't              shoot people with it.
RayDude    : (6) Yeah! Barlow!!! Go, Go, Go!!!!
PhilipED   : Speaking of PGP, Dr. Denning, is that encryption              system secure, in your opinion?
COUNTMINDO : (6) ooo good one.
PaulR42    : (6) Here it is...
RayDude    : (6) hahahah!
RayDude    : (6) Lets see if the NSA cracked PGP yet!!
PaulR42    : (6) she'll sidestep it.
COUNTMINDO : (6) that gets my bet
DDenning   : I don't know of anyone who's been able to break the              IDEA algorithm that it uses.
RayDude    : (6) Time to pull a Ronnie Reagan, for Denning...
Kyrahn     : (6) they are working on it COUNTMINDO : (6) oh she said it!!!
RayDude    : (6) Bullshit! PGP uses RSA and IDEA!
RPTime     : Back to the audience for a question from Steve HW..
COUNTMINDO : (6) wake up the neighbors
MegSaint   : (6) Wait, I thought PGP was RSA
PaulR42    : (6) What's the diff?
Question   : This is for Dr. Denning.  What is the evidence of              harm if the Clipper proposal is not
Question   : adopted?
RayDude    : (6) RSA uses public/private keys meaning you can              publish your key and anyone can send you a 100%
RayDude    : (6) private message
Kyrahn     : (6) the trick is to have something that mutates when              someone attemps to "illegally" break it
PaulR42    : (6) And IDEA? DDenning   : The harm would be to the government.  They would not              be able to use it and would
RayDude    : (6) With idea, you can't spread your key. It's the              only thing that protects your code.
Kyrahn     : (6) call it BackFire
DDenning   : have to resort to something less secure.  Also,              Clipper is part of a larger
COUNTMINDO : (6) awwww poor government
RayDude    : (6) IDEA uses only one password.  PGP gives you a              public & private.  Your can only read your mail
DDenning   : project to make hardware available for encryption and              digital signatures.  This
RayDude    : (6) if you decrypt it with your private key when              someone scrambles it with your public key.
MegSaint   : (6) So what was Denning talking about then?
RayDude    : (6) Hence anyone can send you 100% private mail              without knowing your secret keyword.
Kyrahn     : (6) RipemMac use dual components
DDenning   : will be used, for example, in the Defense Message              System.  The goverment
DDenning   : needs a new standard.
PaulR42    : (6) OK, I get it now.
Kyrahn     : (6) but is still under developement :<
RayDude    : (6) A bit of trivia, did you guys know that our              contries founding fathers were crooks?
COUNTMINDO : (6) then let the government use what they want and              let us use what we want
Kyrahn     : (6) of course! DDenning   : I personally believe that making really powerful              encryption like SKIPJACK available
RayDude    : (6) Thats right, they were sumglers, trying to evade              Englands taxes. Hence for the constitution
COUNTMINDO : (6) god bless 'em ;)
PaulR42    : (6) Explain, RayDude, that can't possibly be true.
RayDude    : (6) having lots of protections against abuse!
DDenning   : without key escrow could be harmful to society.               Wiretaps have been essential
Kyrahn     : (6) same thing with most "city" Fathers
RayDude    : (6) Too bad they didn't put in privacy protection              too. :-I
Shuddup    : (6) Right. Cops got search warrants, I got a door              lock; cops make mistakes, but I'm worried about              crooks
PaulR42    : (6) So even Geo. Washington said "I am not a crook?"
RayDude    : (6) Their idea was to have a tiny government, only to              serve, not to rule.
Shuddup    : (6) I just want to pick my own size and cost of              doorlock!
DDenning   : for preventing and solving many serious crimes and              terrorist activities.
Barlow1    : Why on earth would the government have to use              something else if they failed to get the rest of
Kyrahn     : (6) I am Not A Crook!!
RayDude    : (6) It's a matter of view point. To the Brits he was              a crook & traitor.  To us a hero. But the
Barlow1    : rest of us to buy into this folly?
COUNTMINDO : (6) but she said it wasn't to stop criminals
RayDude    : (6) smuggling was not a publicised thing.
PaulR42    : (6) One man's revolutionary is another man's freedom              fighter.
Barlow1    : Hey, they are already using SKIPJACK. It's a              government algorithm and has been in use for a Kyrahn     : (6) besides the rest of the world will not use              clipper
Shuddup    : (6) I think she DID say that clipper was to stop              illegal wiretaps, or at least that it could.
DDenning   : CPSR and others are asking the government to drop              Clipper.
Barlow1    : long time. There are plenty other algorithms which we              can use which are truly protected... unless of PaulR42    : (6) And it's a good thing too, Dorothy!
Kyrahn     : (6) so it stands to reason that the crooks you worry              about will use some exotic
Shuddup    : (6) Right!
RayDude    : (6) BTW: Over the internet we have an 80% petition              rate!!! 80% of the internet opposes clipper!
Barlow1    : course, this is only the first step in a process              which will outlaw other forms of crypto. And I
Kyrahn     : (6) and over 100 major companies
COUNTMINDO : (6) i signed my electro petition
Barlow1    : believe that it must be. Makes absolutely no sense              otherwise. MegSaint   : (6) I'll be sending in my petition soon. Just got the              latest CPSR Alert with the address.
RayDude    : (6) I put my name on Satan's list, yeah baby I did..              :-)
Barlow1    : EFF is not asking the Government to drop Clipper,              though we would vastly prefer they did. We're
PaulR42    : (6) But most Americans have no idea what the NSA is              trying to do with Clipper. And is has such a nice na
PaulR42    : (6) me
Barlow1    : merely asking that no steps be taken to require it              either by law or practice...as, for example, would

Barlow1    : be the case if you had to use a Clipper chip to file              your tax return.
RayDude    : (6) eyebrows from big businesses, we can raise              everyone's eyebrows eventially
PhilipED   : Dr. Denning, do you think this is the "first step in              a process to outlaw crypto"?
RayDude    : (6) eventually. (sorry)
COUNTMINDO : (6) no, no way, yeah that's the ticket...
DDenning   : No I do not.  The government has not been using              SKIPJACK to my knowledge.
Kyrahn     : (6) well I got to go/ But keep in touch!
DDenning   : The Clipper initiative represents the first time that              the government has put
PaulR42    : (6) Can a MacPGP encrypted message be decyphered by a              PC user, and vice versa? Is there PGP for PCs?

Shuddup    : (6) bye
COUNTMINDO : (6) bye
PaulR42    : (6) See ya!

MegSaint   : (6) Paul, I believe the answer to bothe or your              questions is "Yes"

DDenning   : NSA developed algorithms are not available for              purchase by the public.
Barlow1    : I appreciate their willingness to make some of that
COUNTMINDO : (6) more audience questions, c'mon!
Barlow1    : crypto research available to a public which has paid              so much for it, but I'm afraid that I would
RayDude    : (6) I'm here on AOL.. Just send mail to RayDude. :-) MegSaint   : (6) Heck, the government developed these algorithims              with OUR money! Yes John!
RayDude    : (6) Or if you have internet access, it'll be faster              to send me mail to rarachel
Barlow1    : never trust an algorithm which was given to me by any              government. And I certainly don't trust
PaulR42    : (6) Is Barlow1 JPB's aol address?
MegSaint   : (6) Will do, RayDude.
Barlow1    : a classified algorithm like Skipjack, even without
PaulR42    : (6) Right on John!!!!
Barlow1    : a back door which everyone can see. I think I'll              stick to systems which have been properly vetted

Barlow1    : to be clear of such compromises, like RSA. I hope              others will do likewise and that RSA will become
PaulR42    : (6) uh huh
Barlow1    : the standard which Clipper shouldn't be.
MegSaint   : (6) I find it hard to believe that Denning hangs out              on AOL
RPTime     : Time for one more question from our audience...
Question   : To John Barlow.  Isn't society becoming increasingly              vulnerable to concerted
Question   : criminal/terrorist disruption, requiring *stronger*              law enforcement tools?
RayDude    : (6) Meg, gotcha in my address book... will send a              copy when it's done.  Want a beta, or want to wait?
COUNTMINDO : (6) holy right winger, batman PaulR42    : (6) I wonder if Denning listens to the Dead?
PaulR42    : (6) Dumb question, sorry
COUNTMINDO : (6) naw, funny one
MegSaint   : (6) I'll take beta. What's life with out a little              risk?
Barlow1    : Gee. I don't know. It's a scary world. However, I'm              willing to take my chances with the few terrorists
COUNTMINDO : (6) life without risk = disneyland
RayDude    : (6) booooo.... stupid question! I've sent so many              good ones, why take that one?
MegSaint   : (6) Some might consider Barlow a terrorist
Barlow1    : and drug lords there are out there rather than              trusting government with the kind of almost unlimited
PaulR42    : (6) I'll bet she hasn't eaten as many shrooms at Dead              concerts as JPB  RayDude    : (6) disneyland=lawyers, lawsuits, cops,              big-mickey-brother, etc... bad, bad bad!
Barlow1    : surveillance power which Clipper and Digital              Telephony would give them. It's a touch choice. But
MegSaint   : (6) So why did you send the stupid one, RayDude :)
Barlow1    : when you look at the evil perpetrated by government              over this century in the name of stopping crime,
RayDude    : (6) That wasn't mine Meg..  But I should have sent a              stupid one.. them's the only ones accepted...
RayDude    : (6) it seems...
Barlow1    : it far exceeds that done by other organized              criminals.
COUNTMINDO : (6) hey mine was accepted  :(
PhilipED   : Dr. Denning, hasn't remote listening technology              enhanced police abilities to eavesdrop to the              point...
RayDude    : (6) Sorry :-)
MegSaint   : (6) Oops, misunderstood your comment. PhilipED   : where the loss of a few wire taps won;t mean much?
PaulR42    : (6) Hasn't Time Mag cooperated with the CIA and              helped them obtain info in the sixties?
Shuddup    : (6) It wouldbe interesting to know how many questions              where sent up!
RayDude    : (6) Sorry Count... didn't mean it like that...
DDenning   : No.  They need to get the cooperation of the service              providers to implement
MegSaint   : (6) Do they *have* to or are they just supposed to ?
COUNTMINDO : (6) is this thing over at 10?
HotRodKart : (6) TIME = LEFT
RayDude    : (6) More like cooperation of the service providers or              the service providers will be fined $10K a day!!!
DDenning   : a wiretap.  The loss of some wiretaps could be costly              indeed.  As an example,
RayDude    : (6) The FBI digital telephony bill requires that all              networks have a spy line or they pay $10K a day!
RayDude    : (6) if the damn thing passes!
DDenning   : wiretaps were used to help solve a case that involved              plans by a Chicago

DDenning   : to be bombed.  I could go on.  If we take John's              arguments about law enforcement
DDenning   : to their logical conclusion, we'd just get rid of law              enforcement.  I think it's better
RayDude    : (6) Why should we as tax payers pay $10Billion a year              for Clipper when only 10-15 wiretap warrants are
DDenning   : to have it.  The people in law enforcement hate it as              much as the rest of us when
RayDude    : (6) actually given out to law enforcement agents per              year? RayDude    : (6) Is $10Billion the cost of 10 or so wire taps a              year????  I think not!
DDenning   : some member of the community does something wrong.               And they correct it,
RayDude    : (6) It's only for spying on us!
DDenning   : design new procedures and laws where necessary, and              go on.
Barlow1    : Oh, please. I'm not proposing eliminating police. I'm              opposing giving them unlimited powers. COUNTMINDO : (6) foreign countries will laugh at this
Barlow1    : Also,these are the same cases cited over and over by              everyone from you to Judge Freeh.Surely, we RayDude    : (6) BTW: They plan on exporting clipper.  What              country would be stupid enough to use a chip that              will le

Barlow1    : aren't going to fundamentally change the balance of

RayDude    : (6) BTW: there's talk that the recent espionage case              is simply media fodder incited by the NSA so that

RayDude    : (6) "So we need clipper and we need to ban all other              encryption"

DDenning   : law enforcement any additional authority to do              wiretaps.  Barlow1    : Well, this is where we basically disagree, Dorothy.              If we could continue the same level of LE capacity
PaulR42    : (6) But it gives them the capability to do so.
MegSaint   : (6) Does Denning think we're all stupid?

MegSaint   : (6) I came with something of an open mind. She isn't              helping her cause any. not with me, anyway.
Barlow1    : overhead involved in wiretap, which is what keeps it              under 900 cases nationwide at the present.
RayDude    : (6) She's good with crypto, but a real idiot when it              comes to anything about the gov't.
RayDude    : (6) Or maybe they just pay her well...
RPTime     : And that will have to be the last word on the matter              for tonight...
DDenning   : The overhead of a wiretap is more likely to increase,              not decrease.

@_subject: PC Expo summary!! 
PC EXPO
Perhaps one of the great lessons to be learned from this is that you should not rely on others to always be there to help you in your endeavors, even if they are cypherpunks and have already volunteered.  Out of all
the cypherpunk folks who have "volunteered," to help out at PC Expo precisely zero came through.   Like having assholes, everyone also had an excuse.  Still this was my idea and as such I refuse to give it up
without trying.  In light of this blatant rats-fleeing-the-ship
syndrome, a great load of kudos goes to my friend Sal, who although
not a cypherpunk, and although short on time, and although he is the
CIO of his company, and although I did not run into him at the pre-
arranged place, did show up and did distribute diskettes as promissed.
I would strongly suggest that you send him "Thank you" notes as he
is not on the cypherpunks list, but helped enourmosly.  His address
is denaro09  Also much thanks to Tung Ming Wong
whose email address I don't have.  He also helped out even though he
knew nothing about Clipper, Digital Telephony, the NSA, or the
Now as with all disasters, the blame is partially my own.  I should
have kept a whip on you guys and made sure you'd come. :-)  But I am
at a greater fault (more on this later.)
Now before you accuse me of being lazy, let me remind you that I
have taken a great deal of time out of my schedule to even go to
PC Expo.  Luckily my boss wasn't able to say "no" because he was
too busy in meetings the day before, and even if he did say "No"
I'd rather give up my job than give up my principles.  As a result
of my endeavors, I hope that I have at least set forth an example
for the rest of you, and that you will do well to sacrifice some
time and money on disks and distribution at Comdex, Software Developer's Expo, or whatever expo.  And make copies out to others as well.
With the exception of Sal, Tung, Greg Broiles (sent 25 disks for
this project!), Dave Mandl, Perry Metzger, and Susan Fullar, I am
pretty disappointed in you guys.   Dave and Perry weren't directly
involved in this project, but their Feb 17 speech which I taped
and had Sue transcribe (not a cypherpunk) was the centerpiece of
the articles.  (I want to add an extra load of thanx to Perry for
not showing up to do a speech for my crypto class as since he didn't
I had to get over my crowd-shyness and did a killer, informative
I did the hard work for you already.  I've set the precedent, I've
built the disk, I've written the software. Yes, I wrote software,
even while pressed for time, I wrote a professional looking installer program, a file lister program, and a menu program, all of which are mousable, and have windows, buttons, menus, and
all the other neat features of modern software.  The disk looks
and feels fairly professional.  With the correct style of label
the disk looks like its a free demo from some company, when in
actuality it is free software.   Now if it sounds like I'm
congradulating myself and patting my own shoulders, it's because
I am!  Also, all of the above software is "freeware" and as such
is copyable.  So if you'd like to get your greedy little hands
on it, and use it to make a fortune, feel free.  There are
no restrictions on use other than that you send me free
copies of any package you include my 'wares in.
Although on the surface this may indicate a "failure" it was actually
a far greater blessing in disguise.  I didn't need much help, and it
turned out I didn't have to do much work.  I still believe that between Sal and myself, we made a little, albeit important grass-roots
dent in Clipper's armor (not that it wasn't already dented and as well
built and solid as swiss cheese.)
I was supposed to meet Sal infront a diner near PC Expo at 9:00am.
Borland's Marketting engine decided to give me a call and make an
offer I couldn't refuse.  The woman wouldn't get off the phone even
after I told her, "Yes, put it on my Visa Card, I gotta run!"  So I
wound up at the meeting place at 10:14AM, with Sal already departed.
Luckily, as I got out of the subway station I ran into an old
buddy of mine, Tung.  He tagged along the whole day and helped out
quite a bit.  I gave him some diskettes to take home, and gave some
out to a few of his friends we ran into.  Not a biggie there. However
as I was in line waiting to get my badge holder, I noticed an arrow
pointing up to the fourth level with the words "Press Resource Office"
imprinted!  What luck!  I dragged Tung with me and started hounding
the press.  I gave out about ten or so disks to the press dudes.  It
seems that I did well to pick male press folk as when I approached a
femme reporter with disk in hand, she loudly yelped "No, no!" as if
I was carrying a bomb....  But all the other reporters took it in
with great interest. I caught the eye of Ephraim Schwartz, and he gave me his card so
now I have a press contact for cypherpunk info.  After deciding that
I had depleted a fifth of my diskette supply on the media, and
well knowing that the media did plenty of Clipper stories I decided
to hand some out to the exhibitors.  I hit MacAffe and a couple
of other companies... anything with "security" on their products
Then, the biggest most fortuitus slop of luck decided to land on top
of me.  WIRED was there.  And to my joy, the just dumped about a
thousand or so magazines on a table, and didn't have anyone watching
it.  Just freebies for all to take.   Sniffing out the territory, I
spread about five diskettes on the table next to the magazines and
retreated while keeping an eye out.  Within two seconds they were
all consumed!  What luck!  I came back about two or three times,
and by the time I had realized it, all my PC Expo cypherpunk diskettes were gone.  Wired turned out to be a good target because
those familiar with WIRED, even in passing are far more of the
type to be interested in crypto software than the average Joes. Let this be a good lesson for the future my droogs!  When the next
Expo arrives, be it PC Expo, Unix Expo, or whatever, pick an empty
table, or a table which isn't being watched too closely and deposit
your eggs there.  The cookoo's egg deposit method worked VERY well
for me.  Even if the Wired table had been watched, the disks I
placed there vanished so quickly, it would be unlikely that the
"watcher" would catch on fast enough to stop the majority of the
disks from being distributed.  And if he "confiscated" them, he'd
be likely to have a look for himself anyway, which is the point!
But mind you, don't get caught.  If you do, you might get kicked
out of the Expo, but even so, in that case you hit the folks
entering and leaving the Expo and give them disks directly. We
can't be stopped.  Clipper WILL BE STOPPED.
Having finished my job I enjoyed the rest of the day.
Meanwhile Sal, (good thing I didn't run into him or we'd probably
not have hit as diverse a crowed as we did) hit the fourth level
near where the press people were.  He didn't have it in mind to
give out disks to the press.  Good thing as I had done that
already.  Instead he gave out disks to all sorts of PC USER GROUPS!
Most of which promissed to distribute/carry the disk as part of
their catalog!!!!!   One of the groups he targeted was cyberqueers
and he rightfully did so.  Being straight didn't stop him from
realizing that this group would be very likely to value their
privacy.   He also handed out some diskettes to the exhibitors.
Between the two of us, we threw out about 80-90 diskettes.  With
the press, this number would remain the same, but the added
noise will help a bit.  With the users group, this number of
diskettes will likely reach the thousands within six months,
a few hundred within a month.  With the users which picked up
the freebies from the Wired table, they will probably give out
some copies. I'd guess on the average that half of them would
make copies for their friends (using software piracy as a model.
here, though this of course is freely copyable.)
I unfortunatly found out (here comes the blame part!) that the
installation script I had written had a typo in it.  Now this is
no ordinary typo mind you, but a severe and fairly fatal one.
The installer script that I have given out won't install any
of the articles!  Ugh!  I wish I caught it before the fact,
is twelve and a half hours,) writing the software, and from 4:30am
on Monday to about 1:00pm putting the script and selecting the
articles for the disk.  Now mind you I do have a full time
job and I did risk being fired for coming in four hours late, and taking off a whole day for PC Expo!  So before you start
with the flames, fuck off right now as you did almost nothing
to help.
For those who don't notice the missing articles, they weren't
interested anyway.  For those who do, I hope some of them
are technically oriented enough, or know someone who is
technically oriented enough to type in:
  C:
  CD CRYPTO
  MD ARTICLES
  A:ARTICLES
Which will run the self extracting LHA articles archive. For
those who have email availble to them, can email either me,
or Sal, or the list and I will tell'em how to get at the
articles.  Unfortunatly most of the punch of the disk was in
the articles... But no use crying over what's done... I'll
just make sure that I'll be ready next year.
Anyone who wants a copy of this disk should let me know and
I'll send'em a disk image (made using the DIM Disk IMage archiver program which I've also written.)  Guys, please get
out there and start making a difference.  Being keyboard
cryptographers and keyboard politicians won't help our cause
at all!
I've lost about twenty hours of sleep overall on this project,
a day and a halffrom work, the price of printing labels,
cost of diskettes, etc.  A small sacrifice, and a really big
effect in the long run.  So come on, join in.

MODERATOR:  In any event, again this is part of a monthly series we've             been doing for -- close to twenty years now.  The announcements
            of our March forum, which is (inaudible) with people like             Judith Molina and Hannah Resnikoff from the theater, Richard
            Kostelanetz and (inaudible) and such -- announcements are on
            the table back there, some information about the book club you             might be interested in, and our mailing list.  Sign up for our             mailing list and you will never get off it again.  Unless you
            send us a contribution and become a life member.  Then we take
            you off right away.
            We have lots of -- certainly lots of anarchist literature for
            sale in the back.  Please feel free to peruse and spend a lot
            of money.  At some point, usually after the speakers             finish, we get into questions and discussion.  We're going to
            pass a donation box around.  We've got the door locked so you
            can't sneak out.  Just to let you know in advance, the suggested             donation is $5, more if you can, less if you can't.
MALE:  Much more if you can.
MODERATOR: Right.  Let's see.  Here we have some souvenir flyers.  Anyone
           who gives more, they can get a souvenir copy or have their            program tonight autographed by the speakers. Let's see.  Before
           I introduce them, a couple of sort of "for your information"
           announcements.  Let's see.  All right.  One, old friend and book
           club participant Bruce Caton does a regular series of radical
           walking tours.  Next one is Saturday, March 12th, 1:00 p.m. in
           Chelsea.  I have the material.  If anyone is interested in the
           literature, take one back.  This Saturday, 2:00 p.m., we're going
           to be having a first gathering of anarchists in the lower Hudson
           Valley, Westchester-Rockland area.  And yes, there are anarchists
           in the Westchester-Rockland area.  You're looking at one.  Anyone
           who's interested, see me in the back.  I can give you the details
           of when and where and so on.  Coming up in April is the Socialist
           Scholars Conference, April 1st through 3rd.  Despite the name,
           anarchists do participate in this thing.  We've had anarchist            panels in the past, and we'll probably have both anarchist panels
           and literature tables at the event so, again, see us if you're
           interested.  So -- without further ado, our subject tonight is
           Crypto-Anarchy, and for those of you who saw the original flyer
           that's the Scandinavian version for the Olympics Kripto-Onarchy.
           And our speakers tonight are Cypherpunks Perry Metzger, long-time            cryptographer and lots of other stuff, and Dave Mandl, long-time            book club member and Cypherpunk.  So -- I'll let them take it            away, and just enjoy it.
                                    *   *   *
MANDL:    I'm gonna start off with just sort of a general overview of some
          of the issues and techniques and stuff.  Then Perry is going to
          -- if anyone is taping this, by the way, if anyone out there           besides this guy is making an audio tape I'd appreciate it if           you'd let me know afterwards, because I think people, some of
          them, might want to get copies from you eventually.  Okay.  I'm           going to start off with just a -- sort of a general overview
          of what this stuff is all about.  Then Perry is going to talk
          about some more specifics, and then we hope --hopefully we can           get that over relatively quickly and then we can have a
          discussion, question and answer, whatever.  But first Perry is
          going to say something.
METZGER:  Yeah.  Just trying to get a sense of how much people  know about
          this topic already.  How many people here have any real knowledge
          about what Cryptography is?   Just raise your hand.  Okay.  Call
          it about -- one quarter, one third maybe.  No, less than a
          quarter.  Okay.  How many people here know what the National           Security Agency does? And I don't mean just to the level of           knowing what "National Security" might mean.  So we're talking,
          again -- a couple more.  Okay.  How many people -- well, actually
          that already more or less says it.  This should be interesting for
          you.  Go on.
DM:       Okay.  Perry and I are involved with a group called the           Cypherpunks, which I'm sort of hesitant to say just because it's           a very loose-knit group of people very -- anarchically           constructed, and there are no official spokesmen or leaders or
          anything like that.  Just mentioning it for informational purposes
          only, as they say on all those petitions and stuff. Cypherpunks
          is a pun obviously on Cyberpunk, with "Cypher" being a reference
          to codes and cyphers.  More on that in a second.  If the           Cypherpunks have a particular philosophy, party line, approach,
          we generally refer to it as Crypto-Anarchy.  Crypto-Anarchy is a           term that was coined by Tim May, one of the founders of the           group, Cypherpunks, and it's a reference to like Crypto-Fascist
          or Crypto-Authoritarian or whatever, and the pun being in --
          "Crypto" because the core of what the Crypto-Anarchists or           Cypherpunks do is cryptography.  That's  the basis of everything
          we're going to be talking about tonight, basically achieving           anarchy or sort of working towards anarchy using cryptography and
          other things.  So let me just briefly for the whatever -- twenty-
          seven percent of you who don't know what cryptography is, let me
          just give a brief explanation.
MALE:     Seventy-seven.
DM:       Seventy-seven.  Sorry.  Cryptography is -- I guess a dictionary           definition would be the study -- the science of codes and cyphers.
          Hiding, encrypting, encoding information so that other people           can't read it.  Cryptography in one form or another has been           around for probably thousands of years, probably more than that
          -- as long -- as far back as people had things they needed to           hide.           Let me just give you some really simple examples of what crypto-
          graphy might be.  Let's say that we're planning on doing a bank
          job tomorrow (ridiculous) and I want to pass along to my friend
          over here the name of the guy who's going to be going in and
          opening the vault, who happens to be Perry, let's say.  So I'm
          going to hand him a slip of paper with Perry's name on it, but           I don't want to write "P-e-r-r-y" and give it to him because           someone else may grab the piece of paper away or see it over his
          shoulder or something and then to the -- to the pokey with Perry.
          So what I might do is instead of writing "Perry" on a piece of
          paper maybe I'll scramble the letters up and write "Y-p-r-e-r"
          and he knows based on some previously agreed upon formula that           I take this cryptic message here and move this letter here and
          move this letter here and lo and behold there it is --"Perry".
          And if anyone else intercepts it they just see a bunch of junk,           and they don't know who it is that's gonna be opening the bank
          vault.
          Another way I might hide this information from enemy eyes would be
          to substitute the letters, so instead of writing "Perry" I might
          write "Xwssp" where X represents the letter P and W represents the
          letter E and so on, and again we have some previously agreed-up
          code or formula that says when you see X substitute P and so on,
          and again you put it together and there it is, "Perry".           Okay.  So that's the most basic kind of cryptography.  In fact
          codes that simple haven't been used for probably many centuries,
          and -- especially in I guess the last forty years cryptography
          has made tremendous, tremendous leaps forward so now it's not
          just a matter of shifting letters around.  If you look in           Newsday, the newspaper, every day they have a little puzzle
          called the "Cryptoquote" where they have a quote by some famous
          guy and you have to figure out which letter is substituted for
          which.  So that's baby stuff now basically.            In the last forty years  it's changed so that now it's not based
          on just jumbling letters around but it's based on higher
          mathematics -- extremely, extremely advanced, sophisticated
          mathematics, so sophisticated that the strongest -- the codes
          that are widely used today by like the government or even banks
          would require all the computer power in the world and more to
          crack.  So cryptosystems have gotten much, much, much, much,           much more sophisticated.  So a couple of new developments that           are of interest to us:            Well, the main thing is this ultrastrong state-of-the-art
          cryptography has become available to the hoi polloi, people like
          us.  With advances in computer technology, just a simple PC that
          a lot of you, maybe even most of you, have, in your bedroom,
          you can run software that does extremely sophisticated crypto-
          graphy, in fact so sophisticated that even the NSA, we think, can't
          break it.            So military strength -- for obvious reasons, military strength is
          generally the name they use for the strongest cryptosystems in the
          world, because those are the ones that would be used by the           President for the codes to the nuclear weapons or something like
          that.   Perry and I are going to be giving those codes out a           little later on in the evening.   [LAUGHTER]
          Another thing which Perry is going to talking more about is the
          N.S.A., National Security Agency.  That's the super tip-top-secret
          U.S. government agency that specializes in cryptography.  For
          years they had a complete monopoly on cryptography.  Well, not
          complete, but effectively a monopoly on cryptography.  That's           sort of changed now, or that has changed now, and like I said           jerks like us have access to extremely powerful cryptography,           which is a good thing.           Okay.  So what does this mean?  Who cares?  What do we need crypto-
          graphy for?  Who gives a damn?  Well, I'll tell you.  There are a
          whole bunch of different things you can do now with this extremely
          strong cryptography, and I usually just arbitrarily for no parti-
          cular reason; just to make it easier I usually split it up into           two different categories: defensive applications of cryptography,           and offensive applications.
          Let's start with the defensive stuff, or passive as opposed to
          active.  First of all, more and more -- a lot of you probably know
          this.  Some of you haven't really seen it yet maybe. Everything's
          moving more and more into digital form, and moving to the Net.           We're probably going to be throwing the term "the Net" around a           lot.            People say the Net they're usually referring to the Internet,           which you probably have heard, most of you, because it's plastered
          all over magazines every day now.  The Internet basically in a           nutshell is a massive international network of computers that is
          --basically is totally anarchic.  It spans the whole world,           probably just about every country at this point?
PM:       No, but every industrialized country at this point.
DM:       A whole shitload of countries.  And over the Net, using these
          amorphous connections to computers around the world, you can send
          information almost instantaneously anywhere in the world at the
          push of a button.  That also means that as time goes by more and
          more of your personal information let's say is going to be stored           on the Net and stored in electronic form.  So it's -- we're still
          at the very, very early stages of this happening and it's a really
          important time because first of all while before this infra-
          structure is fully developed the government wants to sort of slip
          by certain laws.            The Net, as I said, is still basically anarchic, and the govern-
          ment doesn't like that, and while we're still at square one they           want to slip in laws that will restrict this ultimate freedom of           movement that people have on the Net.                       Okay.  Let me get into some of these applications.  First of all,
          electronic mail.  Over time -- I mean you'll still be sending mail
          in envelopes to your friends, but more and more mail will be sent
          over the Net. E-Mail.  Electronic Mail.  Electronic mail is           completely insecure.  I don't mean it has an inferiority complex.
          [LAUGHTER]  I mean basically it's completely unprotected.  So we           -- a lot of you here probably use electronic mail every day.  It's
          growing by leaps and bounds.  If I send an electronic mail message
          to someone out here:  "Hi.  Meet me tomorrow night at 7:30."            That message goes out over the Net.  It may be passing through
          several other machines on the way from me to him, and it goes out
          in the clear as cryptographers would call it, meaning it's not
          encrypted.  It's not protected in any way.  Anyone who taps into
          the line, anyone who has the appropriate access to the computer
          system I'm using, can just pick it right out, read the text of the
          message I'm sending, no problem.  That's that.           That's not good, especially if I'm sending sensitive messages           over the Net.  So using cryptography -- this is the most obvious
          use of cryptography -- what you can do is take the message you're
          going to send, encrypt it so that it's scrambled and cannot be
          read by anyone except the person it's intended for, and then           send it out.  Someone intercepts the message, someone reads it,           fine.  Go ahead.  Do whatever you want.  It's a bunch of junk.            You can't make sense of it unless you have the key.  I guess I           sort of skipped over that.  In cryptography, it depends on keys,           so ...
PM:       I'll get into that.
DM:       Okay.  So basically if I send you a message that's encrypted and
          it's intended for you, you will have the key to read it.  No one
          else will.  And like I said, this stuff is basically uncrackable,
          unreadable by anyone, including the N.S.A. as far as we know.            So -- you want to send E-mail to somebody, you encrypt it, send
          it out, that's it.  That problem is solved.  No one can read it.
          No one.           There's another problem, however, and that's what cryptographers
          call traffic analysis.  For example if the Chase Manhattan Bank on
          Seventh Avenue in Park Slope is knocked over every Monday evening
          and they see that every Monday afternoon an E-mail message passes
          from me to Perry even though they can't read it 'cause it's           encrypted they may say, "Hmm. Something fishy's going on here.            There's E-mail going from Dave to Perry every Monday.  Ten minutes
          later the bank gets knocked over."  So without actually being able           to read my message, they still can sort of infer some information
          by using what's called traffic analysis, by the mere fact that           mail is going from this person to that person.  So you want to be           able to hide that also if you can.           The main technique that people have been using and talking about
          and developing to foil traffic analysis is something we can anony-
          mous remailers, which are like mail drops [OR MAIL FORWARDING
          SERVICES].  Most of you know what mail drops are.  Any criminals
          in the audience?  They're like the electronic -- the Net version
          of mail drops.  The way an anonymous remailer would work is -- it
          might be out in Berkeley, California, let's say.  There actually
          are a lot of them out in Berkeley.  There's one in Finland that's
          really heavily used.  I might take my E-mail message saying,
          "Perry.  Chase Manhattan Bank.  The usual.  Seventh Avenue."  Send
          it to this remailer in Berkeley with instructions to the remailer,
          which is an automatic machine -it's a computer program -- saying,
          "Take this message and forward it over to Perry Metzger."
          Okay.  So now what happens?  What's going out from me is an           encrypted, that is completely unreadable message, out to Berkeley.
          A minute later, ten minutes later, an hour later however we set it
          up, a message goes from Berkeley over to Perry.  Okay?  So no one
          can read the mail because it's encrypted. No one can do traffic
          analysis because it's -- it's blurred.  I can even -- without           getting into too much painstaking detail I can bounce it off ten
          different remailers.  I can send it to Berkeley, to Finland, to           here, to there, to there, and then to Perry.  No one looking at
          this -- where the mail is going can possibly figure out what's           going on.              Okay.  That's number one.  More applications for cryptography,           more of these --what I'm calling defensive applications.  Let's
          say you have people on the Net a lot of times asking embarrassing
          questions.  Let's say --there are groups, there are discussion
          groups out there for -- to discuss sex or to discuss like -- you           know people who were sexually abused when they were children, all
          kinds of stuff with all kinds of personal information.  You don't
          necessarily want to send out E-mail saying, "Oh, you know, I've           never slept with a woman.  Can anyone tell me about, you know,           how?"
          That's the kind of thing you see all the time and you don't           necessarily want your name attached to that, so, again, you can           -- you can use encryption to hide the contents of what you're
          sending out.  You can bounce it off these remailers so no one is
          the wiser.           Tim May mentioned this next one, actually.  You can actually lead
          several lives.  Let's say you're like a high government official.           This is sort of unlikely.  Let's say you work for the Defense
          Department or you're the Vice President or something like that but
          you actually have some -- or you're a fancy straight respected           scientist but you have some bizarre views that you don't want your
          name to be tainted with.  Let's say you're a fancy scientist and           you have an interest in UFO's or crop circles or something like           that.  Using cryptography, anonymous remailers and all this stuff
          you can lead a double or triple life, and, you know, lead your
          straight, respected Nobel Prize life and at the same time discuss
          crop circles with some lunatics over in England.  [LAUGHTER]
          And -- you see that all the time.  You see people on the Net who
          use pseudonyms, and actually establish reputations under a           particular pseudonym.  There's someone in the Cypherpunks group           --there have been several people in the Cypherpunks group           -- there was a guy -- he used the name "The Wonderer" and he would
          ask -- you know, he was asking like very simple, basic questions,           and for all we know he might have been -- it might have been           Perry?  And he was embarrassed to say, like "What's cryptography?"
          You know? [LAUGHTER]
          So he used this pseudonym, "The Wonderer."
PM:       You found me out.
DM:       I always suspected.  You can't fool me.      [LAUGHTER]
DM:       Okay.  You might want to hide certain political activities.  We're
          going to go over to the Federal Reserve and knock it over           tomorrow.  Whatever.
          What else?  Purchases.  Over time people will be making purchases
          over the Net.  You may be buying and selling stuff over the Net.            You don't want The Man or The Woman -- Janet Reno, I guess -- to
          know that you buy $300 worth of sex toys every month.  Or you           send out your credit card number over the Net to buy stuff and you
          don't want people grabbing your credit card number, which, as I
          said, is very easy to do.  So, again, you can encrypt this stuff
          and that's the end of people being able to track these purchases
          or rip off your credit card number.            All kinds of other personal information.  Again, more and more of           this stuff's going to be stored in electronic form. Medical
          records, credit history, stuff like that.  If you use cryptography
          to send all the stuff around then you have a little bit less of           a worry about people being able to just circulate it around           freely.   Okay, that's some of the basic -- what I'm calling           the defensive stuff.  Basically just, you know, protect your           privacy because your privacy is going to be in more and more           jeopardy as the Net grows, as Big Brother grows.           Okay, but let's get on to the fun stuff.  There's what I call
          offensive, not defensive, tactics, but more fun offensive stuff.            For example:  Whistle blowing.  You may work for some government
          agency that's doing some particularly horrible thing and you want
          to blow the whistle on them.  Or they ripped someone off or they
          did LSD experiments or something like that.  You can use crypto-
          graphy, anonymous remailers, to blow the whistle on people.            Anonymous transactions.  Again, as more and more people are doing
          business over the Net you can conduct transactions with complete
          untraceability.   Perry, I think, I hope, will be talking a little
          bit about digital cash.
PM:       I will.
DM:       Digital cash is another application of cryptography, where people
          can buy, sell, do banking on the Net without anyone knowing
          anything -- like an electronic Swiss bank account.  People can           buy and sell stuff from each other without even knowing who the           parties are -- a drug deal, let's say, or whatever, and no one           will know who either party is.            Underground economy, that falls into the same category.  Digital
          cash.  Again, if all this stuff is encrypted then it's basically
          untraceable, untrappable by the government, the I.R.S., whomever.           Sending illegal information.  The safe example that Tim May used           when I interviewed him on my radio show was, "RU-486?"  Is that
          still illegal?  Or what's the deal?
TM:       Yes.
DM:       So let's say you want to get information out to people on RU-486,
          the abortion pill, which is illegal in the U.S.  Again, you can
          encrypt it, send it anywhere in the world, completely untraceable.
          Okay.  That's basically it.  What this means is -- and this is           where the anarchy part comes in.  Borders, national borders, are           Swiss cheese.  Basically as things move more and more over to           electronic form, borders -- whether they like it or not, the           governments -- territorial gangsters as a friend of mine calls
          them -- borders become Swiss cheese.  They become completely
          irrelevant.  At the push of a button you can send anything you
          want basically anywhere in the world. No one will know what           you're sending, where you're sending it, nothing.
          There's a quote.  There's a quote in a Cypherpunks article in           "Whole Earth Review."  You can hide encrypted information on           a DAT, a music cassette or a digital audio tape, so, for example,
          Anyone carrying a single music cassette bought in a store could
          carry the entire computerized files of the Stealth Bomber and it           would be completely and totally imperceptible.  Nothing anyone           can do about it.  Again, basically what this does is sort of
          renders obsolete a lot of the laws, or most of the laws, or the
          whole basis for laws that are in place now.  Borders can't be
          enforced, taxes can't be enforced, and so on and so on. You get
          the idea.
          So to cut to the chase, the main goals of crypto-anarchy, the           main goals of the Cypherpunks, are:  (1) to spread the use of           strong cryptography.  Everyone should use encryption.  You
          should send all your E-mail encrypted.            People say, "Why do I need to encrypt my E-mail?  All I'm doing           is saying, you know, meet me for lunch at 12:30.  I don't need to
          encrypt it."  The answer we usually give is most of the mail you
          send out isn't that secret either, but you wouldn't send it all           on postcards.  So sending your E-mail unencrypted is like sending
          all your mail on postcards.  Encrypting your E-mail is like           putting all your mail in envelopes.  One further reason for that           is, again, this traffic analysis thing.  If you send all your           mail out unencrypted, hundreds of pieces of E-mail a day, and           then all of a sudden tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. you send out an           encrypted piece of E-mail, people might get a little suspicious           and look a little further into things.
          That's one reason that we promote the use of encryption all the           time.  If everything is encrypted-- if things are just flying           all around the world, no one knows anything.  Half of them may           be, "Meet me for lunch at 12:30," and the other half may be, you           know, "Let's make a drug deal," or whatever.  So the more people           use cryptography the more the lines get blurred and the more           powerless the authorities become.  There is a dark cloud which           Perry is going to talk about in a second, that unfortunately           -- I would prefer it if we could just stick to this stuff, but           actually there have been developments recently mainly with some-
          thing called the Clipper Chip that is really, really, ugly           and -- the Clipper Chip, and also the Digital Telephony Bill           that -- sort of bring a dark cloud in over all this stuff.
          One thing I'm always talking about is how in the last few years           anarchists or anarchist activists have sort of maybe been getting
          an inferiority complex, because it seems like the cops don't care
          about us that much anymore.  As much as I don't want to be a           martyr, you know that if the cops are tapping all your phones           you at least know that you're probably doing something right.            But I sort of get the impression lately a little bit that, you
          know, the cops just think "Fucking anarchists  Who cares?            They're not doing anything."           Well, you can put those fears to rest, because this stuff is           actually of great interest to the government, and the government
          is going to tremendous lengths to stifle this stuff.  It           definitely has the government's undivided attention, and I guess           Perry is going to tell you more about that now.
PM:       All right.  Now I was touching on this a little bit earlier, but           -- this gives you a little bit of motivation, why this is so           interesting.  It's one thing to say that the government is           interested in this, but does anyone -- I know that some people           in the audience already know the answer to this, but do most of           you -- if most of you are asking yourself what's the biggest and
          most secret agency that the United States government operates,
          you probably think the Central Intelligence Agency.
MALE:     National Reconnaissance Office.
MALE:     The Federal Reserve.
PM:       No.  It is the not the N.R.O., either.  The N.R.O. is bigger than
          the C.I.A., but it is not bigger than the N.S.A.
MALE:     Is DISCO more secret than the N.S.A.?
PM:       Pardon?
MALE:     DISCO?
PM:       DISCO?
MALE:     I guess it is.
PM:       It must be.  The National Security Agency -- spends more money
          and has more employees than all of the other intelligence           organizations the United States government operates combined.            Okay?  It spends over $30 billion a year only on signal           intelligence operations (SIGINT).  I'm about to get into what           those are.  This is something  that the government cares about           extremely passionately.   They spend vast amounts of money on it.
          You should ask yourself why.
          Now what exactly is the business of the National Security Agency?
          The business of the National Security Agency is signals           intelligence.  Most people aren't aware of it, but signals           intelligence is considered by most intelligence analysts to be           the most important form of intelligence.  Signals intelligence           played incredibly important roles all through World War II.  How
          many people here knew that the Battle of Midway was won entirely
          because of signals intelligence intercepts?  Okay.  A couple of           people.
MALE:     Seven percent.
PM:       How many people in this audience knew that the Battle of the

Atlantic was largely not a complete disaster because of signals
          intelligence work?  A few people know.            What is signals intelligence?  Why does the government care so           much about this?  Signals intelligence, put simply, is the busi-
          ness of reading other peoples' mail. That's it, most baldly.            It's the interception of communications, whatever form those
          communications take.   And it's a very, very big thing with the           government. The National Security Agency basically has two           jobs. One of them is to be this gigantic ear out there           that listens to all the communications that it can unearth.           Period.  Now one of the problems is that lots of foreign           governments don't like having all their communications listened           to.  I don't know why.  [LAUGHTER] And lots of private           individuals don't like having all their communications           intercepted.  So they tend to use cryptography.  So one of the           other big things that the National Security Agency spends
          billions of dollars a year on is research in code breaking           -- how to break cryptographically protected messages.
          The other half of what the N.S.A. is try to keep foreign           governments from doing the same thing to us. They're also in the           business of developing codes and trying to protect the United           States government and government contractors from having their           communications intercepted.  Naturally there's a small conflict
          here, because the people who spend their days trying to break           other countries' codes and foreign companies' codes and American
          citizens' codes, they're not supposed to do that anymore.  At           the Congressional hearings in the Seventies they promised to           stop doing that.
          Anyway, the people who spend their days monitoring, you know,           cellular telephone calls in Moscow would prefer that the           technology developed by the people who are developing ways to           keep the United States government's communications secure not           get into the hands of the people who are trying to make cellular
          telephone calls in Moscow, because they want to be able to listen
          to all of this stuff.
          So we've got this conflict between the two halves of the National           Security Agency, and the side that wins is almost always the           people that slurp up traffic.  They never talk about any of the
          techniques they use, and they try to keep them as secret as           possible.  And until the early 1970s there was almost no private           sector research on cryptography done in the world.  The National           Security Agency had a monopoly on information about cryptography,
          and to this day they never have said -- they still have a great           reluctance to declassify things from the Second World War.  Put           it that way.
          By the way, the National Security Agency is truly huge.  They           have at least ninety thousand employees that we know of.  They           occupy the entire Ft. Meade military base just outside of           Washington.  It really is bigger than all the other intelligence           agencies put together.  It's of course an agency that's extremely
          secretive, and until the 1970s they did not even admit that the           N.S.A. existed.  N.S.A. was said to stand for "No Such Agency."
          Something rather interesting happened, however, in the early           Seventies, which is that a few computer scientists and           mathematicians, specifically Whitfield Diffy, Ralph Merkel and           Martin Helman, came up with the first major discovery in           cryptography outside of the government sector in about fifty or           sixty years, which was this notion called "public key           cryptography."  It's an idea that was so feared by the National
          Security Agency that they actually attempted to quash all open           research and publication on the subject.  They discovered that           it was not possible to do so, much to their chagrin. This little           thing called the First Amendment gets in the way.  But to this           day they attempt with every means possible that they can to try
          to deter research in the public sector.
          Now what was it that Diffy, Helman and Merkel came up with that           they considered to be so dangerous?  I have to explain a little           bit more about cryptography than I like to in order to explain           this.  The reason it's more than I'd like to is because frankly           unless you're really interested on an intimate level cryptography
          gets rather boring.  It's like discussing the details of auto
          mechanics.  It doesn't make for interesting talks.  But I'll talk
          about it for a minute anyway.
          All modern cryptosystems have two components to them.  There is           an algorithm and there is a key.  The algorithm is basically           your recipe for saying how you're going to take your message in           on one end, scramble it up and spit it out the other end.  But           the algorithm is not a complete recipe.  It's missing a portion.
          That portion is the key.  The idea is that by having this thing
          called a key, that's -- it's just like a key to a lock in a door.
          Thousands of people can own exactly the same model of Yale lock           all over this city, but because each of them uses a different           key on their lock two people who own the same brand of lock can't
          open each other's doors.  Well, it's exactly the same idea.  By           separating out this small piece of information -- it's usually a
          large number these days -- two users of a system can -- different
          people can communicate using the same cryptographic system without
          being able to read each other's messages, and indeed one of the           rules for designing cryptosystems is that the cryptosystem should
          only depend on the key for secrecy.           You should be able to tell people exactly how you're encrypting           things, but just not tell them what the key is.  And they should           be unable to decipher your traffic no matter how hard they try.
          Now most people know that -- you know, your ordinary door, you           walk up to it, you unlock it, use a key, you lock it again, you           use the same key.  This is actually the way that most           cryptosystems used to be before Diffy, Helman and Merkel.  Now
          this causes a problem.  Let's say that I want to communicate with
          Dave.  Okay.  Now we have to exchange a key securely.  I can't           just call him up on the phone and say, "Hey, Dave. This is the           key we're going to use," because someone can be tapping the           phone line.  I have to actually go up to Dave, you know, hand
          him the key, and then go off -- or send a courier and then go           off and later on communicate with it.  But let's say that I want
          to then communicate with, say, you.  I can't use the same key I'm
          using with Dave, because then you could read the traffic and I
          wouldn't necessarily want you to be able to read the traffic.            So okay, now I have two sets of keys.  Well, let's say I'm           communicating with several hundred people regularly.  Well,           I have to exchange keys with all of them.  This is an enormous           pain in the ass.  What Merkel, Helman and Diffy came up with was           something called the public key concept.  It's a really neat idea.
          Imagine for a moment -- imagine a mailbox for a moment that has a           mail slot in it.  Okay? And once something's been stuck in the           mail slot it's inside the mailbox and the only way to open the           mailbox is with this key.  But anyone can stuff things into the           mail slot.  Anyone can put things in, but only the owner of the           key to open the mailbox can get things out.  The idea that they
          had was this.  Let's say that we had cryptography systems in which
          there were two keys, two keys that cannot be determined from each
          other.  I cannot figure out what one of the keys is based on what
          the other key is.  One of the keys encrypts things:  takes them,           scrambles them up, makes them look like gibberish. You cannot,           however, unscramble things with that key. You need the second           key in order to descramble things.           The scrambling key is the encryption key, or the public key.  It's
          called a public key because I can give it away.  I can put in the
          phonebook or in an ad in the New York Times or anywhere else I           want, "this is my public key."  Anyone on earth can use that,           because you cannot determine from that key what the decryption           or private key is, the key that I keep to myself, that I don't           tell anyone, and which is the only way to read things that have           been scrambled up with the public key.  Now this is a real           revolution.
          Now I can just give thousands of people the same key to send mail
          to me or to have phone conversations with me or what have you,           and all I have to do is keep one key private and I'm secure.            I no longer have any problem with key distribution.  Now this           might not sound terribly revolutionary, but consider that we live
          in the modern age and we've got lots of computers and computerized
          telephone systems and things like that. Because of public key           cryptography -- and this is not practical without public key           cryptography -- I can build a telephone system where, every pair
          of phones in the country have public keys associated with them
          and the public keys are published off somewhere and when you pick
          up the telephone and dial a number, your telephone asks a           database somewhere what the public key is for the number I'm           calling, finds it out and scrambles the entire telephone conver-
          sation using that public key.            So instead of having to worry about and sweat over distributing           keys to everyone I talk to, I can afford to encrypt my conver-
          sations with the corner store, or the pizza parlor that I'm           calling to give an order to.  I can encrypt absolutely everything.
          This wasn't practical before public key cryptography was invented.
          Public key cryptography makes cryptography really cheap and easy           to use.  This is something that the N.S.A. doesn't like, obviously,
          and that's why they tried to keep this information from being           published to the point that N.S.A. officials who were apparently           not acting under official orders sent letters to lots of           publications telling them that if they published any information           on this they'd be violating acts about the publication of           classified information, and they tried to contend that all           research in cryptography was born secret and that once you wrote
          a paper you couldn't read it again unless you had a security           clearance.            Unfortunately, as I mentioned, they were forced to back off of           this.  There were lots of reasons for this, one of which is that           the courts didn't agree with them.  One of them is that lots of           the research goes on in foreign countries, which, believe it or           not, are not run by the U.S. government, at least not all of them,
          not yet.            But anyway, what happened was that in the early Seventies these           people came up with this new concept.  This spurred an interesting
          revolution, because suddenly lots of people in academia saw that           there was interesting research to be done in cryptography and that
          they could do it outside of the N.S.A.  Before the early 1970s all
          the cryptographers in the United States for the most part who had
          any degree of serious interest in the subject worked for the           N.S.A.   That was it.  That was your only career path.  Now there
          are thousands of people who work on cryptography in academia in           this country and in countries around the world, and it's a real           serious subject of study.  There are conferences several times a           year, people publish this stuff in the open literature.           So there is now this thriving field of study, which the N.S.A.           really doesn't like -- because as I mentioned, the people who are
          basically that big ear trying to listen to all the conversations           around the world -- and by the way, when I say they try to, I           really mean it.  They've got listening posts all over the world           to try to intercept every possible radio transmission,           microwave-transmitted telephone call, every satellite-based           communication, everything they can get they tap-- you know,           cables going between foreign countries -- everything they can
          possibly do to listen to as many conversations as they can.
MALE:     Supposedly they monitor every overseas phone call in           this country.
PM:       Yeah.  Whether or not they actually do is a matter of speculation,
          but it's thought by many that they do.
FEMALE:   Well, they do sample.
DM:       We don't know what they do for sure.
FEMALE:   No, trust me.
DM:       Okay.
FEMALE:   So if you say, "Bomb the World Trade Center," they pick           up on those words.
DM:       Possibly.  Anyway -- while all of this was happening in the mid-
          Seventies and early Eighties with cryptography developing as a           field of study, at the same time the computer revolution was           happening.  Now computers -- I know that everyone on earth by           now has heard about -- has seen their People Magazine or Time           Magazine or Schlock Magazine No. 525th article on the Information
          Superhighway, and the Internet and how wonderful it all is -- and
          you probably all want to fall over and gag when you hear any more
          hype from people who don't know what they're talking about.            Well, I'm going to give you some more hype, but at least I do know
          what I'm talking about.  The Internet is a really amazing thing.
          I can sit in my office in New York and I can collaborate with an-
          other person who's working in Australia and I can send mail to           friends of mine that gets there instantaneously who happen to be           in Finland -- or communicate with tens of thousands of people           that I've never met.  If it wasn't for the Internet, I never would
          have met Dave.  In fact if it wasn't for the Internet the           Cypherpunks Movement would never have started, because all the           people involved in it found each other over the Net.  Now in the           future, whether you like it or not, the Net's going to be where           you do your catalog shopping ...
DM:       Perry, I just have to mention.  There are about 700 plus           Cypherpunks today.  I've met I think three of them in the flesh           in a year and a half.  PM:       I've met more, but it's amazing how many people you get to know           and be friends with and you've never seen.  But you know, I --           in the future it's possible for many kinds of work to be done           remotely thanks to these technologies. If you're a writer you
          don't need to be anywhere in particular, do you?  I mean you can
          write your books in Fiji for all you care.            And if you're a reporter, unless you're a beat reporter and you           go out to interview the fireman at the fire or what have you, if           you're someone who, say, covers wider issues you can do your           business from almost anywhere that you've got a telephone and a           computer.
          The Internet makes that an even bigger thing.  In the future I'm           probably going to be able to send a little message down to the           pizza parlor around the corner and have a pizza delivered over           the Internet.  Everything you do is going to be done over the Net.
MALE:     Isn't it going to taste a little funny sucking through that wire?
PM:       Well, no.
MALE:     No worse than Domino's, I guess.
PM:       It tastes fine once you encrypt the pizza.  Anyway -- the thing           is that the Internet -- now when Dave said that the Internet is           an anarchic thing, this is not a lie.  This is literally the           truth.  The Internet has no central control, no central planning.
          It's operated basically on the premise of, "Okay.  I've got a
          connection.  Oh, you want to connect up?  Okay.  Connect up to           me."  There is no such thing as a central Internet management           office. There is -- yes?
Q:        What's the Internet Naming Authority?
PM:       The I.A.N.A. is -- to the extent that there is any sort of central
          organization, that can be said to be it.  But what do they do?            They give out Internet numbers.  If they stopped doing it, people
          would probably start routing in NBGP domains, you know, on their
          own and assigning their own numbers.  It's not like you can exert
          control over the Net that way.  But never mind.  I don't want           to...
COMMENT:  It fits most people's definition of God.  The circle whose center
          is everywhere, whose circumfrence cannot be found.
PM:       The Net is organized basically without any -- the Net has no           knowledge of what borders are.  Okay?  I can communicate with a           machine in Finland as easily as I can communicate with a machine           in New York.  One of the results of this is that when people in           one country are told, "Oh, you can't put this sort of information
          up on your computer," well, generally speaking someone in another
          country will offer to put the information up for them. And at that
          point the attempt to control the flow of information is completely
          meaningless.            Does everyone know -- there's this court case now in Canada where
          the Canadian press has been forced not to say anything about the
          court case.  Well, of course anyone who's in Canada and is           connected to the Internet can read all the details that they want
          to.  Borders are completely meaningless. The U.S. government has           this interesting rule that you cannot export cryptographic           software from the United States.  I'll get into that more later.
          But one of the interesting results of this is that when people           have built large packages -- large pieces of software that           involve cryptography -- what they've generally done is to just           specify how the cryptographic pieces have to fit in, and people           in foreign countries have written a dozen or couple of dozen           lines of computer software to implement those things and put them
          up on computers in Finland. For some reason putting this stuff up
          on computers in Finland is really popular.  I don't know why.           [LAUGHTER]  Really, it is.  The Network traffic between the United
          States and France is dwarfed by a factor of five compared to the           traffic between the U.S. and Finland.  It doesn't make any sense,
          but that's the way it is.
          But, you know, the Internet has changed the way many people who           are computer professionals now live.  For instance, the chairman           of Autodesk, which is this very successful computer company,           decided that he didn't like living in the U.S.  So he moved to
          Switzerland, got an Internet connection and managed his company           from then on from there.  I think recently he decided he wanted           to retire and hired another manager, but never mind;  the point is
          that the Net really breaks down barriers to information.  You can
          not restrict information to one country, you cannot keep           information from flooding around the world almost instantaneously
          to any place that's on the Net.            Everyone is on the Net.  The Russians are on the Net.  People in           Singapore -- where the government of Singapore thinks that they're
          exerting control over what books can be sold in the country, I           have news for them.  Stuff going over the Net is far racier than           anything that they think that they're censoring at the border.
          So here we have this wonderful Internet, and the problem with it           is it's completely insecure.  The way it's been built right now,           anywhere I tap a line I get enormous amounts of traffic going by           and it's all conveniently already computerized so I can use           computers to listen in on it.  If the N.S.A. wanted to build a
          computer system to watch all the electronic mail going between           two countries, it would be nice, easy, feasible.  There'd be no           problem.            This is a problem.  Now the problem is of course easily solved           with cryptography.  If you encrypt all your communications,           suddenly it's impossible to tap them.  This is of course something
          that the National Security Agency doesn't like, so they try to           do things like restricting the export of cryptographic software           from the U.S.            Well, I have news for you. Software is just information.  Software
          is no different from any other kind of information, and if I put           software up on the Net suddenly it's in every country in the world
          within hours.  Mysterious how this happens.  This has happened           with cryptographic software several times. There's a fellow by           the name of Phil Zimmerman who wrote a nice public key           cryptography package called PGP, put it up on a machine in the           United States.  Well, wouldn't you know it -- available in Italy           -- oh.  By the way.  Duncan has about ten copies of PGP for           anyone who wants them.   [LAUGHTER]  We're having trouble           controlling the distribution of cryptography software here.
          [LAUGHTER]
          Anyway.  Sorry.  Flying disks.  Yes.  But seriously, that's as           easy as it is to get your hands on cryptography software these           days.  It's all over the Internet.  People can download it from
          Finland, from Italy, from France and England.  It's everywhere.            And the N.S.A. doesn't like this, either.
          Now stepping back from that for a moment, I'll mention that we've
          talked about ordinary applications for cryptography up to now:            how to keep your communications secret using cryptography. We           touched earlier on the fact that you can do banking using crypto-
          graphy.  Now why would this be particularly interesting?  Well,           this guy David Chaum, in Holland, came up with a system -- and           I'll just ask you to take this on faith -- you can read a book           like Bruce Schneider's book [Applied Cryptography] later if you           like and figure out why this would be so -- but it is possible
          to construct a money transfer system in which it is guaranteed
          that all parties are anonymous and no parties have to trust each
          other.  Now that's a really neat feature, isn't it? You don't have
          to trust the other parties, and you don't necessarily have to know
          who they are.
          Now remember that the Internet allows communications to go all
          over the world now.  So let me give you the following little           scenario.  Let's say that I had a little pocket computer in my           -- you have an Apple Newton, don't you?  Is it with you?  Let me           hold that for a minute. Now I don't know if people are aware, but,
          you know, this is as small as computers have gotten and in fact           this is large compared to the HP100.  There's a very powerful           computer here.            It even has a communication link so it can talk to other computers.
          Right here.  I can keep it with me.  Let's say that I'm sitting in
          a cafe in the East Village, say, and I'm going to meet up with           this guy who has promised to give me this contraband I've been
          really interested in -- nude pictures of Nancy Reagan.  Okay?
          So he shows up in the cafe.  You know, I've never seen the guy           before.  Never mind.  I look at the pictures. Yes, I want them.            We both get out our little computers, put them in front of each
          other.  Each of us presses a button and suddenly I've paid him
          $10,000 which I've extracted from my offshore bank account over
          the Internet, handed to him and lord knows what he's done with           it.  He might have sent it for all I know to the same bank or to
          one on the other side of the world.  No way to know.  No way to
          trace it.           Now U.S. banking law says that I can't do business with foreign           banks inside the U.S., but it's very difficult in the presence of
          strong cryptography to know whether or not I am communicating with
          a foreign bank.   Or to regulate the transport of money.
          If you're living in the underground economy and you're dealing           with cash all the time it gets very cumbersome, you know?  You're
          carrying around $10,000 in cash.  It's a big wad of bills.            Keeping cash in your home is inconvenient, moving cash around is
          inconvenient.  It's dangerous.  You can't get interest paid on           your cash.  So what you really want is offshore banking, but           offshore banking has been inaccessible to people.  Well, this           might very well blow that wide open, and I'm certain that the           I.R.S. and the N.S.A. dislike this possibility.
          Imagine what happens if half the population finds itself able to           function in the underground economy with all the ease with which
          they can function in the above-ground economy right now.  They've
          got their bank, they've got -- you know, they can make investments
          if they want.  They can transfer money.  Hell, it's more conven-
          ient.  It's much more convenient than the way we do things right           now, and I can clear and transact -- right now if I wanted to,           say, a credit card transaction, you know, a merchant has to be           set up to do a credit card transaction and it's really risky.
          Someone can steal the credit card numbers, etc.  This is           extremely secure, and I can exchange information with anyone and I
          can do it using ordinary equipment that I can buy off the shelf.
          That's another thing that I want to point out here. Every computer
          is dangerous to them.  Every single computer in the world is an           extremely high quality cypher machine if it has the right           programs, and programs are really easy to copy.  They're as free
          as air.  They move very fast.  I can throw one -- pretty           inaccurately, but never mind.  Anyway -- flying software, faster
          than the internet... [OVERLAPPING COMMENTS AND LAUGHTER]
          The people in Fort Meade, you know, at the N.S.A. --their offices
          are known as the Puzzle Palace to some people, largely because to
          a large extent what they do is they spend their days worrying           about really intricate mathematical problems.  And there's -- I           suspect not much that makes the people in the Puzzle Palace more
          nervous than the notion that equipment that anyone in the world           can buy for a couple of hundred dollars can make it impossible for
          them to tap some communications.            It's incredibly cheap -- cryptography software is virtually free           right now.  Almost anyone can get software that's really good for
          free.  And computers are cheap.  And you can't keep the software           from moving around.  This is probably the stuff of their           nightmares.
          You know, remember that their mission is to listen in on every-
          thing, and they're faced with the threat that they may be able to
          listen in on nothing.  Compound that with the fact that then we
          have these science fiction scenarios of people able to conduct           untraceable, unwatchable transactions without the I.R.S.'s all-
          seeing eye being able to detect it -- or FINCEN's.            How many people here know what FINCEN is?  I'm curious.  Okay, we
          have two or three people who know what FINCEN is.  Do you know           what FINCEN is, sir?
MALE:     No, I don't.
PM:       FINCEN is the government agency that collects information on all
          of your large bank transfers and tries to note if you are engaging
          in a pattern of criminality with them. Right now it can only watch
          all of your transfers over $10,000, or things that are           suspiciously close to $10,000.  They would like to watch all of           your bank transactions.  This is all in the name of...
          Oh, by the way.  Does everyone knows what the Four Horsemen of the
          modern governmental Apocalypse are?  The excuses for virtually           every civil rights reduction that's happened in the last few           years.  The Four Horsemen are: terrorists, drug dealers,           pornographers and child molesters.  Okay.  Now all the time           you're told, "But what if terrorists got their hands on
          cryptography technology?"            By the way, the answer to this is that anyone who wants to get           their hands on it -- let's put it this way.  This book [Applied           Cryptography] can be purchased in any bookstore. Explains           everything about the state of the art in modern cryptography.            Any of you who knew enough about computers could pick this book
          up and write software probably good enough that the government
          could not listen in on your communications.  Trying to keep
          this stuff out of the hands of anyone is rather difficult.  The           horse is already long out of the barn.

But unfortunately, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are still           there and the government is trying to use them as an excuse right
          now.   How many people saw the articles on the front page of the           New York Times about Clipper?  Okay.  A bunch of people have.            How many people saw the front page article in the New York Times           about the F.B.I. Digital Telephony Bill?  Ah.  Fewer people.  I'll
          start with the F.B.I.  Digital Telephony Bill, because it's much           easier to understand.            The F.B.I. is not satisfied with the fact that our phone system
          is not like the phone systems in Eastern Europe, and wants it to
          be that way.  [Laughter]  They want the capacity to be able to           push a button in Washington at any time they like and tap any           telephone in the country at will.  That's basically it in a
          nutshell.
          They claim that they need this capability because modern digital           telephone systems are becoming increasingly difficult to listen in
          on.  Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility did an           F.O.I.A. [Freedom Of Information Act] request on the F.B.I. and
          managed to get documents which said, "By the way, we know this is
          a lie but we're trying to get this bill through.  So please lobby
          for it."  In fact no one has ever found that they have any           difficult tapping the existing telephone systems, but never mind           that.  They are saying that because of advances in technology           they need the capacity to be able to sit in Washington, push a           button and listen to any telephone conversation in the country
          at will.  This is of course in order to stop the terrorists, drug
          dealers, pornographers and child molesters.  If they can find some
          one who is all of those at once I am sure it will make their day.
          Anyway, at the same time the National Security Agency has been           having these nightmares about cryptography so they've gotten the           Clinton Administration to front for them on a really, really           stupid idea.
MALE:     Ten copies of the Justice Department announcements, the five           press releases from a week ago.
PM:       Okay.  Well, basically what's happened -- maybe we'll pass these           out in a minute -- is that this has been in the works for some           time and people have been fighting it, and so many people have           been fighting it that we thought it was dead, but it seems to           have come back from the dead.  The government wants you to use           their cryptosystems.
          What they want is they want to give you a little cryptography box
          called "Clipper" that you can use, so that you don't have to           complain that all of your communications are insecure.  But           Clipper has a built-in bugging feature in it, so that if the           government wants to listen in on your communications they can do           so.
          Isn't that special of them?  And they expect that everyone in the
          country will want to use this.
MALE:     And each one's got a serial number.
PM:       Yes, yes.  The way this basically works is that they store           basically the equivalent of a master key to the cryptography           system inside -- I'm trying to keep this from being too technical
          -- essentially every time you use the Clipper chip to communicate
          with something that also contains a Clipper chip, well, what it           does is it includes information about the key you are using in           the data stream that it sends to the other machine, and it's           encrypted with an encryption key that is known to the government
          -- to keep everyone nice and honest.  You know, we don't want to           keep those terrorists, child molesters, pornographers, drug           dealers from being able to encrypt things.
          (Ie: "We're your government.  Trust us, we know what's good
          for you;  but we don't trust you.")
          However, they say that this standard is voluntary.  Now if you
          were a card-carrying terrorist would you use the government's           cryptography system, especially if it's voluntary to use it?
          No.  What you're probably going to do is go out and get yourself
          a decent cryptography system.  Hell, if you're actually being
          armed by the Libyans they probably have nice KGB crypto equipment
          that they can hand to you.  You don't have to worry about going           to the store to buy your cryptography equipment.
          So in general the notion that they can impose this as a voluntary
          standard for encryption, which you're not compelled to use, is           ludicrous, and almost everyone in the community thinks that what           they're doing is preparing to try to ban all forms of encryption
          other than the ones that they specifically approve.  So we've got
          these two interesting government movements right now, the one to
          make tapping all of your telephones easier and the one to make it
          easy to decrypt the communications on the telephones that they've
          made it very easy to tap.            I thought that the Berlin Wall had fallen and the Stazi was out           of business, but apparently they've all just moved to Washington.
          [Laughter] It's kind of annoying.  But on the other hand, ignoring
          all of this, they're -- by the way, I'll mention that every           industry group, groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation
          and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, all the           trade magazines, everyone on earth has come out saying this is a           stupid idea.
DM:       The 700 Club did a ...
PM:       The 700 Club actually did a story about how evil the government's
          cryptography plan is.  It's amazing. Everyone and their mother
          has come out against this, but it doesn't seem to matter.            According to an article that's going to be published in next
          month's "Wired" several administration officials have admitted
          that this might be their Bay of Pigs, something really stupid that
          they inherited from the previous administration, which they did,           which they're going to push forward anyway full steam ahead.
MALE:     So whose head's going to explode like a flying -- you know, in           Dallas -- as a result of this thing?
PM:       I don't know.  Well, anyway, so -- now ignoring what the           government is trying to do to stop cryptography, I'll point out           that all is not rosy with cryptography.  You can encrypt your           communications, you can try to be really careful about all of the
          dealings you do, and if you try to live, say, purely in an           underground economy one day you sit in a caf
 with the wrong guy           and he pulls out his I.R.S. credentials and says, "Can we do an           audit, please?"            Now it might be difficult for them to be able to spend the           resources necessary to try to track lots of people down for
          abusing this sort of thing.  In fact, I would argue that there's
          no way that they have all the resources necessary to do that.            But nonetheless, let's point out you can't do everything in           cyberspace.  You can't live in cyberspace.  You have to live in
          a home somewhere.  You have to go to the corner store to eat.           You have a physical body.  They can still get you.  They           can still pass laws to try to restrict your freedoms.           Cryptography, however, does make them much weaker in many ways.
          One of the things that's been pointed out repeatedly is that           government feeds on money.  The lifeblood of government is money.
          If they don't have money -- what traditionally happens in a Third-
          World country that's experiencing hyperinflation?  At some point           the soldiers discover that their pay no long will buy them food,           and they start revolting.  Government workers are like everyone           else -- well, sort of like everyone else, but [LAUGHTER] --
          government workers do have families, they do have mouths to feed.
          They need to be paid.  And when the government tries to print
          money to pay them the money becomes less worthwhile.  So they           depend on taxes in order to be able to control people.
          In an environment where it becomes increasingly difficult to tax           activities, it becomes increasingly difficult for the government           to exert control over the population.  In fact, the more people
          move into some sort of cryptographic black market, the more
          difficult it becomes for the government to try to stop it because
          the fewer resources the government has.  It's sort of a vicious           cycle for them.  They need to have money in order to try to get
          money, and the less resources they have to -- actually, Duncan,
          you know this off the top of your head.  How many millions of
          Americans are thought to evade taxes right now?
DUNCAN:   The Feds say officially there are ten million nonfilers who should
          be filing, and at least another ten million filers who file           incorrectly on purpose.  That's out of 114 million personal tax           returns filed last year, down from 117 million predicted.  They           undershot by 4 mil.
FEMALE:   They had like 900 convictions out of ...
PM:       How many convictions were there for tax fraud last year?
DUNCAN:   It's only about three or four hundred a year.
PM:       In spite of this -- it's very, very difficult for them to expend           the resources to try to get a tax fraud conviction.
DUNCAN:   It costs $50,000 bucks, or -- and then you got to imprison 'em. I
          mean it costs half a mil or a mil.
MALE:     Usually there's one other factor, and that is that there's only           one Treasury agent per 900 filers.  So the enforcement bureaucracy
          is actually very small.  This came up in the debate over the gun           issue, where there's a mention of 240,000 gun dealers and about           one enforcement bureaucrat for every 240.  That's a highly           regulated field by comparison with general tax filers.
PM:       Anyway -- Dave points out that I'm kind of dragging this on, and           we should open it up for questions.
MALE:     ... one other factor that hampers the I.R.S.?
PM:       Yes?
MALE:     They've got infiltrators.
PM:       Oh?
MALE:     There are people in the I.R.S. who are on our side.
PM:       Okay.  Anyway, if we're done with the major, initial part of the           talk -- I think we made some of the interesting --I've missed           talking about a bunch of things, like the fact that you can put           -- there are all sorts of neat things people have discovered           about cryptography over the years.  You can play poker with people
          by computer without having to trust the dealer or any of the other
          players, and you can mathematically prove that no one has cheated
          in the course of the game.
          There are all sorts of neat tricks that cryptographers have come           up with over the last few years, and if people -- anyone with a           mathematical background, I strongly encourage you to go out and           buy a copy of one of the books on the subject.  Actually the best
          book on the subject right now is Bruce Schneier's Applied           Cryptography.  This is a technical text.  If you're not interested
          in cryptography on a technical level, if you stopped with math           before algebra or something -- I'm not trying to denigrate anyone.
          Some people are not interested in math.  There's nothing wrong           with not being interested in math.  But this is a math book,           basically. It's full of math.  If you want to know the details,           however -- published by John Wylie & Sons.
          There are some very good books -- it'll be up here. If you're           interested in the history of cryptography, David Kahn wrote an           extremely good book that only covers the world up to about 1970.
          He mentions the N.S.A. These were the days before they admitted           that they existed, but he has chapters discussing them.  The book
          is called The Code Breakers, by David Kahn.  It is still an           interesting book to read, because it gives you some idea about           how hard it is to produce good codes and how important it has           been in history.  Most people are completely unaware of the
          historical importance of secret communications and breaking
          secret communications.
MALE:     The British government for about seventy years claimed they           weren't breaking any telegrams, and in fact they were taking
          every one into a room and trying to ...
MALE:     The N.S.A. lied about it for years, also.
PM:       The so-called Black Chambers.  All through the 19th century           virtually every government in Europe had something called a           Black Chamber, which was the room into which all diplomatic
          correspondence coming into and out of the country was brought to
          be read.  Most of it was encrypted, but some countries had pretty
          good cryptographers.  This has been going on for centuries.            There is nothing new about this.  The only thing new about this is
          that suddenly world-class cryptography is in the hands of           everyday people.           Lastly, there's a great book about the N.S.A. that Lou mentioned
          a moment ago, called The Puzzle Palace by ...
DM:       Bamford.
PM:       The Puzzle Palace is, again, about ... (Inaudible; overlap)
DM:       It's available in cheap paperback.  Very good book.
PM:       Oh, by the way.  If you get a copy of The Codebreakers by David           Kahn, do not get the paperback.  Get the hard-cover. The text is           different.  The text of The Puzzle Palace in softcover is exactly
          the same.  It's a really good book. It's unfortunately about a           decade old, but it covers them in an enormous amount of detail.            Most people are completely oblivious to what the largest           intelligence agency in the U.S. is.  You should inform yourselves.
DM:       So let's open it up ...
PM:       For questions.
                               *   *   *
Q:     I don't understand the details of Chaum's method of electronic        banking, but I thought it required that the bank would issue        essentially denominations of bills that were public keys.
PM:    Are they publicly keys?  I could go into the details, but I don't        know ...
Q:     My point is, how do you get this going without the cooperation of a        bank?
PM:    Form your own bank.  That's basically the answer.  You have a digital        bank that issues digital money, basically.
MALE:  If you have a couple of hundred people you can form your        own credit union.
PM:    In fact there are some people in Texas who are now forming a credit        union on the premise that the credit union is going to permit people
       to make electronic cryptographic transactions.
MALE:  The problem with this digital bank and any other under-ground economy
       is that if your digital cash is stolen or if this digital        underground economy collapses you will have no recourse in law
       enforcement, in civil suits or FDIC insurance.
PM:    Well, first of all -- I don't want to claim that the FDIC is a        wonderful thing here, but even assuming that it was I honestly trust
       AAA-rated Swiss banks far more than I trust any bank in the United        States -- or the full faith and credit of the United States        government.
MALE:  Here, here.
PM:    Which is going down every day as the deficit increases.
Q:     But who issues digital cash?
PM:    No, the point is that you cannot steal digital cash.  It doesn't        work that way.  You can -- now the bank can defraud you.  You        admittedly have to trust your bank.  However, you cannot really        steal digital cash.  It doesn't work that way.
MALE:  It's protected using encryption.  It's very complicated.
Q:     Are you claiming that Virtual Virtue has been invented?
PM:    No.  I'm claiming cryptography has been invented.  It does not --        the bank can defraud you.  Someone cannot steal your digital cash.
Q:     Why wouldn't this be an attractive notion to most Americans, and        subsequently why would this seem to be a scary notion to the        government?
PM:    I will explain it to you right now.  In this city, most people think
       that most people comply with the tax regulations and with Federal        regulation.  New York City is one of the most fascistly-run places
       in the United States, so it would not be surprising that we have the
       most thriving underground economy.  Go downtown to Chinatown and you
       will find building after building after building of off-books        businesses:  clothing manufacturers, import-export businesses,
       everything you can imagine, being run in a completely underground        manner.
       The garment industry would not exist in New York City if it was not
       for the underground economy in New York City. Okay, forget what        middle-American people will do.   The underground economy already
       exists, and this sort of thing is going to move forward and there's
       probably going to be demand from people who are already in it.
       As for the question of "virtue", as I said I would go into the        cryptographic protocols in detail, but -- you cannot be robbed of        your digital cash from your wallet the way that you can be robbed of
       real cash.
MALE:  They can't rob you any more than a regular bank can.
PM:    It's not actual cash.  It's really an anonymous transfer.
Q:     Doesn't digital cash (?) to the maximum capitalists and fascists,        too, or are we just catching up with things?
MALE:  This is a problem.
PM:    Whether you like it or not, it's there.  The computers are out there.
       The technology has been invented.  It cannot be uninvented.  It can't
       be put back in the bottle.  There are tens of thousands of people in
       this country who understand how to build these things.  At this point
       it's impossible to stop it.  So whether you like capitalism or don't
       like capitalism, whether you like technology or dislike technology,        this is a reality. I would advise personally that you try to use it        to your benefit.  Perhaps other people have different opinions.        That's what I would think.
Q:     A two-point question.  First of all, have you seen the article in the
       Humanist(?) about digital cash?
PM:    I'm afraid I have not.
Q:     Have you?
DM:    Can't say I have.  No.
Q:     Okay.  Secondly -- now the promo for this talk says it'll make the        State a thing of the past.
PM:    I think that's something of an exaggeration.
DM:    Basically what we're talking about, and it remains to be seen how far
       it's going to go, is the withering of the State in the sense that        governments can no longer say -- now they can say we won't let this        book cross our borders, you can't do certain kinds of financial        trans-actions, you're not allowed to read this stuff, you're not        allowed to make bootleg copies of this record.  All this stuff is        going to be going on more and more, and it's unstoppable by the        government.  So in other words, a lot of these laws are just
       unenforceable, superfluous, as this stuff starts travelling over the
       Net in encrypted forms.
MALE:  That's victory to some extent.
DM:    Right.
PM:    Oh, yes.  It is very much -- it's sort of the exponentiation of (?).
       As soon as you allow in -- the Chinese discovered this at Tiennamen        Square.  Fascists and totalitarian governments and Communist        governments have known this for a long time.  You want to keep the        copy machines in your country as difficult to get to as possible.         You want to keep the telephones difficult to get to, and make them        bad and tap them all the time.
       You want to restrict the flow of information.  One of the things that
       happened after Tiennamen Square were these informal fax networks came
       into existence all over China, and within hours people all over the        country knew the truth about what was going on.        Information from satellite broadcasts and from foreign radio stations
       got in and swept over the country.  This just compounds that problem.
       If you're going to take part in the modern world, if you're not going
       to be like Albania, you're going to have to allow in the Internet.
       As soon as you allow in the Internet, people are going to start        exchanging data.  As soon as they start exchanging data some of that
       data might be encrypted, and you have no way of knowing what it is        that they're bringing in or putting out.  You can't control it, not
       short of controlling every single computer that exists in your        country.
Q:     Has there ever been a case where the government has broken the code        and ... (Inaudible; overlap)
PM:    In the thirties all the time.  Bootleggers would use primitive        cryptographic systems to communicate with each other and would get        hauled into court.  In fact Kahn's book, The Codebreakers, talks a        lot about this.  You bring up a very important point.  Not all        cryptography is good cryptography.  The program WordPerfect is really
       popular out there.  It has a little function that will let you save        an encrypted version of your file.  It's totally useless.  With a        couple of milliseconds' worth of work, another program can just        break that wide open.
       You need strong cryptography.  Just any cryptography won't do.         Insist on -- but in the past very often people using secret codes        for communication have been hauled into court by the United States        government.  It's happened.
Q:     Were they drug dealers?
PM:    In Prohibition they were drug dealers.  Yes.
Q:     Recently.
PM:    Recently, no.  It has not happened recently.  One of the things        that's very strange is that more of them are not using cryptography.
       There are companies in the U.S. that will sell you commercially phone
       scramblers that are really, really good.
MALE:  [INAUDIBLE].  I'm not sure who is reading my mail. It takes a lot of
       effort to do something, to cause anarchy to happen, and everyone        would have to be involved, and I don't see that there's any payback.
PM:    I disagree for the following reason.  First of all, the people who        know these programs are reasonably smart, and most of them are        actually talking to each other right now.  And there are real        attempts made to try to make sure that they all communicate with        each other fairly well.  This is intentionally so that people do
       not face the question of having:  "Well, I've got Encryption        Program A and you've got Encryption Program B.  Yes, we can talk."         One of things also by the way in public key is that it makes it easy.
       Just so long as I know that you're -- Duncan can give you two disks.
       If you want you can just throw one at one of your friends.  Hopefully
       he'll catch it and it won't hit the floor.  And you don't actually        have to communicate with each other in advance or communicate with        any of your other friends in advance in order to exchange information.
       You just have to have compatible software.  And the marketplace is        taking care of that, because people want to communicate with each        other.
MALE:  But it is not anything the government can't regulate.  I know you        say that it can't, but you can regulate it that kind of stuff.
PM:    They can try to stop it.
MALE:  I don't see any way [INAUDIBLE] ... MALE:  It also benefits me.  I may consider that I benefitted from breaking
       Midway(?) codes or Atlantic codes or whatever it is.  [INAUDIBLE].
PM:    Well, there might be benefits to you, but unfortunately it's --        whether this is fortunate or unfortunate in fact, it's not your        choice.  It's not up to me, it's not up to you, it's not up to        anyone.  The cat's out of the bag.
MALE:  It's not.
PM:    Oh, yes, it is.  Anyone can buy a copy of this book.
MALE:  I can get anything I want off your computer.  Anything I want.         You send any kind of electronic mail, I can get it (?).
PM:    How?
MALE:  There's always a way.
PM:    No. I'm an electronic mail administrator.  There are ...
MALE:  I can use a rubber hose cryptosystem.
PM:    Yes.  Admittedly.  I can come up to you and I can beat you up.  At        which point what does it matter?
MALE:  I can change your computer so it doesn't -- I can monitor your        keyboard, watching you type.  I mean there's all these ways.  It's        not a question of [INAUDIBLE].
PM:    It becomes very rapidly prohibitively expensive ...        (Inaudible; overlap)
DM:    There's a question of how much it'll cost the government. There are        estimates that if the N.S.A. used every computer they have and they        ran it for eighty years nonstop, they'd be able to break -- you know,
       it's like angels on the head of a pin.  I mean ...
PM:    He points out very correctly that if they're willing to spend enough
       money they can monitor -- they can break you.  On the other hand,        it's extremely expensive for them to do that and cryptography is        really cheap.  In fact if you have a computer already cryptography        is absolutely free.  Now admittedly, computers are not absolutely        free.  But anyone who has a computer right now, anyone who has a        computer right now can communicate with anyone else who has a
       computer right now securely, securely enough that what they spent a
       couple of hundred dollars setting up the government will have to
       spend tens of thousands of dollars trying to go after.
MALE:  It's actually millions probably.
PM:    Not necessarily.  If they come after you with rubber hoses it might        be relatively cheap ... [LAUGHTER]
MALE:  Forty dollars.
PM:    You say things like, "Well, I have to coordinate these things, and I
       have to come up with..."  Yes. Admittedly you have to have standards.
       But remember, most people in the world who do technical stuff very        naturally try to follow standards.  You won't go to the average        telephone store and buy a telephone that does not plug into your wall,
       and that's not because they particularly like you or they        particularly like modular jacks; it's because they want to make sure
       -- because they know that if you buy a phone that doesn't plug into
       your wall -- well, you won't buy a phone that doesn't plug into your
       wall.  Put it that way.
DM:     Perry, you know, keep in mind that a lot of this stuff is the         ground floor.  It's square one, whatever, and the idea is to let         people know what's going on, let people know what the problems are,
        let people know what the solutions are now, and maybe five years         from now -- again, the problem I sort of hinted at before was that
        because it's still early the government's trying to do things like         slip in the Clipper chip and stuff to prevent these things before         they happen.  It's just important for people to know about this         stuff.  As time goes by new systems, new software, will have all         this stuff built into it and ...
MALE:   You won't even know you're encrypting.
DM:     Yeah.
Q:      What about the falling price of processing power?
PM:     Well, this has two interesting effects.  There is an extent to which
        this makes it easier to crack codes. However, not as much as you         would think.
Q:      What about lengthening the number of digits in the prime that you ...
PM:     We won't get into these details, but basically one of the features         of things like public key cryptosystems is that if you have twice as
        much computer power lying around you can encrypt things much more         securely using the same amount of time and it takes exponentially         longer for the people who are trying to break what you've done.
MALE:   Not only -- as processing power falls -- it is cheaper...
PM:     It becomes faster.
MALE:   As the specific cost of processing falls, of processing power falls,
        it becomes progressively cheaper to use longer and longer keys,         which cost more and more time ...
FEMALE: Witfield Diffy says to use three crypto scans ABA.
PM:     Well, that's DES.  Never mind.  We're getting into details that we
        shouldn't, probably.
MALE:   The point is the cheaper ...
PM:     As computers get cheaper, it will become harder for them to break         codes using non-rubber hose techniques.  That's true.
MALE:   Decryption becomes more costly.
DM:     Steve, in the back.
STEVE:  First of all, it's been very interesting subject, thanks  but I'm         goin to rain on your parade...  A couple of things come to mind.          [INAUDIBLE].  One thing of course is the issue of acces.  Most of         the population doesn't have access to the equipment, and certainly
        if they have access to the equipment have very limited knowledge,
        and really it winds up ... [INAUDIBLE] ... being a very small group
        of individuals. [INAUDIBLE] ...  If we're talking about this in the
        context of -- this is creating a new, nonauthoritarian society, that
        can't be done by a small group of individuals acting through an         Internet or electronic data process.  It requires a [INAUDIBLE]
        social organization.  You know, you mentioned Tiannemen Square.          Well, the efforts [INAUDIBLE] ... You get an Army that is willing         to repress the rest of the population for the resources of the rest
        of the population.  As long as that happens ... [INAUDIBLE] ...
        One other thing I should mention, when we talk also about the issue
        about people pulling out, about the underground economy -- one you
        mentioned, the underground economy of Chinatown.  I'm not sure

is about is it's a new form of social organization.  [INAUDIBLE]
        The umbrella is that I think it can be an important tool, but ...
PM:     Answering your points -- I don't entirely disagree with them, but         I'll point out that the technology is actually very cheap.  It's         not free, but it's cheap enough that people we would consider to         be extremely poor can afford it at this point.  You can get a         computer that can link you up to the Internet for maybe something         on the order of $100 if you try hard right now.
MALE:   I could do it for $5.  A VIC-20 and a VIC-20 modem are essentially
        free.
PM:     Well, you have to find one.  That takes some time.
MALE:   It's in somebody's closet.
PM:     The other thing is Internet service is actually fairly cheap right         now.  For about $10 a month -- actually, if you count the cost of
        having to have a phone line around, call it $20 a month -- you can
        be on the Internet.  And the price is only going to fall with time.
        It's admittedly not free, but it's not out of the capability of         ordinary people to pay for.  You're right that most people don't         know this is an issue -- which is why we're here.  It's not -- and         I'll also agree with you that so long as the government has the         capacity to shoot people en masse if it so desires, the State will
        continue to exist.          This is not a panacea. It's just a tool.  There are people out there
        who are extremely enthusiastic about it. It might be a really neat         tool; a really good tool.  But it is just a tool.  However, if         people did in fact pull out of the economy in a big way, at least         out of the above-ground economy, or as De Soto refers to it, out of         the formal economy -- as opposed to the informal economy, because         after all, you know, why should you refer to it as a black market?
        It's a market for honest people, not a market for dishonest people.
        As more people enter the informal economy, being able to pay for the
        tanks and pay for the people to stand behind them becomes more and         more difficult.  Admittedly though, you're going to need to be able         to provide alternate means of society organization.
        There are all sorts of issues that come up.  This is not the answer
        to everything.  It's just a really, really important tool you should
        know about.  Yes.
FEMALE: Just to get back to the issue of digital cash. When Leonard(?)         talked to Chaum(?).  What he wants to do is develop a card reader         for your PC, so you can download cash onto your card in your home
        from your bank, wherever it is.
DM:     Citicorp already offers that service. PM:     But it's not terribly secure.
DM:     It's admittedly not secure, but they do offer it.
PM:     It's also not anonymous.
FEMALE: They have a debit card, do they?
DM:     They have a debit card.  If you go to their Queensboro center in         Long Island City you can see -- there are sample machines up there.
        They use it for all electronic transactions.
FEMALE: And so they give you a sort of -- they charge you ...
DM:     It's like five dollars a month.
FEMALE: You have to rent this? [INAUDIBLE; OVERLAPPING VOICES]
PM:     It's not purely abstract money in the sense that digital cash is not
        a form of currency.  It's really just a way of doing anonymous         transactions.  You can be doing anonymous transactions against bank         accounts backed in dollars or yen or gold or whatever else your         heart desires.  It's really just a way of simplifying the concept of
        doing anonymous digital transactions.  It's not really in and of         itself a currency.
MALE:   Right.  That's the part that's hard to imagine. [INAUDIBLE]
PM:     It could not be.  That's not the way that it's designed to work.
FEMALE: How do you generate such a system without trust to begin with?  I         mean -- I've got $10,000 in my Swiss bank account, Perry, and --         alright, here you go.  Turn it into digital cash for me.  But --         I mean you have to act as a banker for me, right?  And there's         just...
PM:     Someone has to act as a banker for you.  I suspect very soon it will
        be your Swiss bank, whom you already trust.  Or it will be some --         you already have to trust someone. People ...
FEMALE: But you've got the FDIC behind it in CitiBank... [Inaudible]
PM:     But there are people who trust their money to Swiss banks right now,
        and Swiss banks don't fail.  And they don't, generally speaking,         commit fraud.
MALE:   People lost money on FDIC-insured accounts because of inflation, so
        you can lose money on insured accounts.
PM:     Well, anyway, the point is yes, you're right.  There is a question
        of trust involved.  You have to trust some of the people that you
        are doing transactions with.  If you have a banker, for instance...
MALE:   Use several banks.
DM:     We may develop methods -- protocols -- which will allow you -- I         can't get into this, because it hasn't been done yet, but it's         possible.  You may be able to deal with a financial institution that
        has wide-open books.  The books are published in electronic form,         kept on the Nets, so that anybody can check their account and they
        can even check everybody else's account -- except they can't check         the balance.  They can just tell that nobody's screwing around with
        it -- in a way that cannot be easily defeated.
PM:     There are some neat protocols people have come up with for doing
        anonymous cryptographic auditing.  Again, however, there are ways         of committing fraud -- say, that the bank is actually dealing with
        something being backed by gold.  You know, one day they could bring
        up trucks, take all the gold and leave everyone hanging.
DM:     There's always a way to do that.
PM:     You could do that with banks right now.  If you go to the super-
        market you can hand the guy your dollars, he can pull back the         groceries behind the counter and just refuse to give them to you.          You know, you can go to the park and you can give the guy your money
        and he can fail to deliver what people go to parks for these days.          Look. There are always issues of trust involved.  I'm not going to         address that.  That's a wide open issue. It's a huge issue.
FEMALE: There's no paper trail involved.  If I make a deposit and you give         me the goods, what record do we have that this ...
PM:     I can -- there are paper trails.  There are receipts.
DM:     No, there are.  It's complicated.
MALE:   It's not paper.
PM:     They're not paper, but I can demonstrate to an independent auditor         that I did in fact deposit the money and that these have been the         transactions I've done.
FEMALE: But then in fact does it not eliminate the beauty of ...
PM:     No.  I would have to reveal -- only -- if I want to go to an         auditor, I can choose to reveal my identity to some limited extent.
        I could for instance -- I could have an anonymous account.  There         can be nothing recorded on the account in terms of name or address.
        But I could show someone all the records for the account to         demonstrate that the bank is lying and that there is a certain         amount of money in that bank account and that they've not been         telling the truth.  There are audit trails possible. Yes, ma'am.
Q:      How can we sure that the software we use does not already have         master keys included?  Or get included as time goes on?
DM:     Because you can look at a PGP for example -- I don't know how much
        you know about computers, but there's source code.  I mean you can
        look at PGP, this program that's public domain that's distributed
        all over the world.  You can look at the program itself and see         exactly how it works.  It's well documented.
PM:     The program is distributed in source code.  You can recompile it if
        you want.  You can read all the codes.
DM:     You can.  You can look at the codes.
PM:     Many people have read it.  In fact the code is fully available.          Many people have read it.  You can compile the code yourself.          However, I'll point out that there was an ACM Turing Award talk by
        Ken Thompson where he proved that there is no way ultimately to         completely trust your computer systems.  There is also no guaranty
        that when you lie down next to your lover this evening that they're
        not going to take out a huge steak knife and plunge it right into
        you.  There are no guaranties, folks.  However, to a reasonable
        degree of confidence you can be sure that the software is free of
        holes.
DM:     We only have a couple more minutes, so -- a couple of quick         questions.
Q:      [INAUDIBLE]
PM:     Well, I don't know.  So far as I know, the United States government
        has never brought a prosecution against a foreign bank for doing
        overseas transactions.  They can't.  It's not their jurisdiction.          Presuming that you are doing your transactions with a bank in the         Bahamas, I don't think that the government -- the government can
        charge you with RICO violations.  It's unlikely that they can         charge anyone else with them.  Any other questions?
Q:      [INAUDIBLE]
PM:     You can start -- it's likely you're not, but if you were interested
        in started a digital bank and having a digital bank that, say,         backed its currency using a basket of commodities or wheat or gold
        or anything else you wanted, you can do that.  It's just a mechanism
        for conducting funds transfer.  Admittedly, it's abstract, and people
        are probably never going to go up to a gumball machine and stick in
        their computer in order to get a gumball out.  And in fact people         are probably very unlikely to use it for everyday ordinary         transactions.  But I'll point out one thing.  If you have an         offshore bank account you can get an ATM card for it and you can
        walk into an ATM machine anywhere in New York, stick it in, withdraw
        cash -- your name, your true name, is not necessarily recorded         anywhere.  You can walk to an ordinary supermarket and pay in         ordinary cash if you like.
MALE:   [INAUDIBLE]
PM:     Well, it is legal.
MALE:   [INAUDIBLE] You come into issues of how -- as the money forms         develop towards that, how other things that were previously stable
        may become more and more unstable, you know, which suggests to me
        that the further this thing goes the higher level there is going
        to be of barter.
PM:     This is more an economics question than a question about crypto-
        graphic technology.  I'll agree that there will be interesting
        effects as a result of the advent of digital cash, and that we can
        probably not predict what all of them will be.  At the same time,
        we probably can't stop it.
DM:     I think we have to wrap it up in about two seconds.
MALE:   May I risk of delying the obvious -- at one time you were told that
        the only secure crypto was the one-time pad.  What we're saying now
        is that here's a form of crypto that you can use all the time,         every time, and that you should encrypt.
DM:     One-time pads are impractical, and you don't need -- you don't         necessarily ...
MALE:   They're ancient history now.
PM:     They're still in use.
DM:     Well, maybe, maybe not necessarily.  They're still used. I feel like
        I have to make just one comment to save my ass here before we break
        up, and that is -- Perry -- I've tried to avoid this because we         probably agree on more or as much as we disagree.  Perry considers
        himself an anarcho-capitalist.  I am an anticapitalist.  I have
        problems with the whole idea of digital cash, with the whole idea of
        money.  I'm against money.  I'm against cash.  I don't like banks.
        We don't have time to get into that now, but I just wanted to         mention that, and also -- for all my friends here who think that         I'm a traitor -- also, that ...
PM:     They'd never think that about you, Dave.
DM:     That stuff is all controversial and you can debate about it, but         -- I mean the basic -- I hope that we got the basic ideas across.          The whole business about digital banks, digital cash and whatnot,         you know, do what you want with that, but -- that's gonna vary with
        your particular political slant.  I think that's probably it.
Q:      Do you want to share?
DM:     Yes, I do.

          INTRODUCTION:   Good afternoon, and welcome for joining
us.  It's an absolutely gorgeous afternoon, so we're very happy to
see you here.  I'm Trish Moynihan Williams.  I'm a member of the
Board of Directors of Feminists for Free Expression, and this
afternoon I'm actually the voice of Rachel Hickerson, our Executive
Director, who unfortunately has a bad case of laryngitis.  So I'm
speaking for her, but I really hope you won't miss the opportunity
this afternoon to say hello to Rachel even though she may croak
back, and get to meet our wonderful Executive Director.
          I wanted to tell you just a little bit about Feminists
for Free Expression for those of you who are just getting to know
our organization.  We are a group of diverse feminists working to
preserve the individual's right to read, hear, view and produce
materials of her own choice without the intervention of the State
"for her own good."  I encourage you to learn more about us.  There
are pamphlets in the entry way as you came in if you haven't picked
one up already.  And to join us.  We are a membership organization,
and really need your support.
          As you see listed on your program this afternoon we have
a stunning lineup for our program on Censorship in Cyberspace, and
that program is going to be moderated by FFE's own Joan Kennedy
Taylor.  Joan has been [involved with] feminist issues since the
early 1970's.  She is the author of Reclaiming the Mainstream: Individualist Feminist Rediscovered, which was published in 1992 by
Prometheus Books.  In 1993 the Hoover Institution commissioned her
to write the essay, "Women's Issues:  Feminism, Classical
Liberalism and the Future."  Among the places where her work has
appeared are the Wall Street Journal, Success, The Washington Times
and Reason.  She is Vice President of Feminists for Free
Expression.  So I am delighted to turn the program over to her.                           *     *     *
          KENNEDY TAYLOR:  Can everybody hear all right?  There is
no sound system, but I am told the acoustics are excellent.  Okay. This is a very exciting program for me, because so much is going on
and so much is changing so quickly that every day brings something
new.  This is a new age in communications, and it also has its
problems.  On-line services are becoming gigantic.  The InterNet
makes national borders irrelevant, which to some people seems a
real problem.  Torrents of information and misinformation can be
received or disseminated by anyone with a computer modem.  Security
establishments have lost their virtual monopolies on encryption to
such an extent that an article in the Times compares trying to
enforce a universal coding standard such as the Clipper Chip with
trying to enforce prohibition.
          The U.S. Congress just before it adjourned passed the
controversial Digital Telephony Act, a wiretapping bill that
requires phone companies to keep their networks accessible to law
enforcement wiretaps as they install new technologies.  What does
this all mean in the age old fight between those who want to
control how ideas and expression are communicated and those who
believe in the literalness of the First Amendment, that Congress
shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press?
          We have asked a number of experts who also believe in
civil liberties and the First Amendment to explain why we do not
have to abandon these principles as we enter this confusing and
exciting communications age.  Our guests will speak in alphabetical
order, and I hope you all have programs, which give you the back-
ground of all our speakers.  They will speak for twenty minutes
each.  Then there will be a brief period for any questions they may
wish to put to each other and they will then take questions from
the audience.
          First we turn to the relationship between law and
technology.  Advances in communications technology have always been
greeted with suspicion.  Should the law control what we do with
them?  Can the law control them?  Robert Corn-Revere, a Washington
lawyer specializing in communications law, looks at the past and
the future to give us a legal doctrine for the Information Age.

CORN-REVERE:  First I'd like to thank Feminists for Free
Expression for inviting me to come and speak at this today.  I
think that the topic is one of the most important that at least
those of us who care about communications are dealing with right
now and it's one that's going to be developing very quickly.
Although I have to say -- I'll apologize in advance.  I'm from
Washington.  I used to work at the FCC, and so to be talking about
these issues may seem to be a bit ironic.  And to compound that, to
have a lawyer to be the first person to speak in a discussion on
Censorship in Cyberspace is a bit like having a hall monitor be the
keynote speaker at a writer's conference.  But it is an area that
I have been writing about for some time and have some concern
about, and hopefully discussions like this one will help move
toward a greater understanding that can actually do some good. Being in Washington I'm always hesitant to say that, but it is
possible sometimes.
          First of all I know it isn't in the program, it doesn't
mention the term, but I'm going to just say that I hate the
expression Information Superhighway.  If there is a single thing
that we could do to make some sense of what's going on we would
eliminate that forever.  I mean not only does it spawn just this
avalanche of horrible metaphors -- on ramps, off ramps, toll
booths, traffic cops.  Name it, they're out there.  It's just going
to get worse, to the point where the Washington Post finally had a
front page story that talked about the Information Superhypeway,
which is pretty much what it's becoming.  And in a way it I mean it
really doesn't convey any information.  In a way it's a lot like
teenagers and sex.  I mean, you know, everyone is talking about it. Everyone's convinced that everyone else is involved in it.  The
people who are talking about it don't really know much what it's
about but are convinced that once they're doing it too it's going
to be great!  That's a lot of what is going on in the policy
discussion in Washington, D.C.            But I have a particular reason for disliking that
expression, and that is that it tends to focus or it tends to
direct peoples' attention to the means of transmission by calling
it a highway.  So we'll need traffic cops.  And when you look at
the method of transmission historically, that's been the hook, the
jurisdictional hook, for governments to get involved in speech. For that reason I really think we would move a long way toward
clarity if we could shift metaphors.
          As most of you I'm sure know, this year the Congress
failed to pass telecommunications legislation wanting to be in the
forefront of developing the Information Superhighway, talking about
all the vital national policies that are involved.  And while I
don't discount the importance of the issues, I tend to think it's
a little bit dangerous to start the debate and start from the
proposition that Congress needs to be fashioning this for us, and
I think that that's simply going to lead to more trouble.            In really underscoring that, I think it's useful to talk
about communications systems and talk about the development of
these things from something of a historical perspective, because
technology has always been an intimate part of the struggle for
freedom of expression.  It's no accident for example that the first
official censorship bureau emerged shortly after the development of
the printing press.  None existed before then because none were
necessary, and to that extent censorship was the bastard child of
technology.  You didn't need a central official authority to keep
track of scribes.  The Church did that very nicely, thank you.  And
the communications that they produced didn't really pose any kind
of a threat to the State.  First of all they were produced in small
numbers, not mass produced, and in the second place you didn't have
the ability to produce multiple volumes of a uniform copy, of a
simultaneous transmission of exactly the same words.  There were
minor errors between them and it took a long time to copy addi-
tional copies.            But once you had because of the printing press the
ability to crank out multiple documents that could all be trans-
mitted simultaneously, then the communication tended to pose a
threat to official authorities and for that reason you then had
this drive to establish social policy, policy that would constrain
or in some way control that communication for what were considered
by those in power beneficial ends.            And so you see that sort of history repeating itself over
and over again, and ultimately in the end the technology tends to
win.  You can look at the successive means of censorship in the
16th and 17th centuries, whether they were official censorship
bureaus or the Court of the Star Chamber or the Stationer's
Company, and government monopoly licensing and those sorts of
things.  Each of them failed.  Each of them went out of fashion
because the technology of the printing press was superior to the
ability of the bureaucrats to exert control -- up until the point
when you get to the formation of the United States and the adoption
of the First Amendment, where the United States became the first
nation to embrace new technology as an essential component of its
political system.  That's what the First Amendment is about.  It
specifically identifies the press, that new technology of its day,
or relatively new to the framers of the Constitution, as an
essential component of what this country was about.            So technology for the first time rather than just being
a hindrance to official authorities became an essential part of
what free expression is to be and came to be in this country. Despite that hopeful beginning, and despite the fact that it really
took a couple of hundred years, well, 120 years anyway before the
courts started to define what the First Amendment was about,
technology continued to be something of a problem as new technolo-
gies for communications were developed.            The Supreme Court first faced this problem in 1915 when
it was asked to rule on whether or not the cinema was protected by
the First Amendment.  And this was before the Supreme Court had
actually addressed the issue of the First Amendment and what it
meant in any way, but it was presented in this case about a
licensing board, a trilogy of cases actually about a licensing
board in Ohio.  And in that case the Court simply said, "This is
not speech.  We're talking about film here.  It's commerce.  And besides, it's dangerous."  And so they decided that the First
Amendment simply didn't apply to the technology of film.  Now
thirty-seven years later the Supreme Court reversed itself and film
was protected the same as the printed word.  But it took thirty-
seven years and actually longer than that for the pronouncement of
the law to become disseminated through the country, where it wasn't
until 1972 that the last film licensing board, municipal film
licensing board, in Dallas, Texas, was abandoned.  So it does tend
to take a long time.
          The same thing has happened of course with television,
and again, as with the Information Superhighway, the focus is on
the means of transmission and the government's argument
historically has been that we have this medium.  It's scarce
because you have a certain number of frequencies.  If the
government doesn't regulate it you'll have people speaking over
each other, and so the government has to get involved.  And by the
way, we're not just going to be traffic cops to decide people don't
run into each other in the air waves.  We also need to control
pretty much what's said in the broadcasting as well.
          And so again focussing on the way the communication was
transmitted created the jurisdictional hook by which broadcasting
has had second class rights under the First Amendment.  Now that's
changing.  It's changing because the courts have come to be more
sensitive to the First Amendment issues involving broadcasting. Most thoughtful observers recognize that the whole notion of
scarcity (a) was created by government in the first place, and
(b) if, to the extent it was ever true, because government of
course decided how many of those frequencies would be used for
communications, to the extent it ever was true it no longer is,
again because of increases in technology, both because of digital
compression, the ability to get a lot more out of the same band-
width spectrum, and also because there are so many other techno-
logies that can transmit the same information and more than just
broadcasting.  Whether it's cable television, whether it's fiber
optic transmission, whether you're talking about videodiscs,
videotapes, there are any number of ways you can transmit the same
information.            And so the courts are moving more toward an appreciation
of the First Amendment status of broadcasting, to the point where
the Supreme Court this summer in a case involving cable television
essentially said that the government has no business dictating the
content of broadcasting.  Again, that was just language that the
court used, but it tended the signal the direction they're heading. And I think ultimately again the technology will win.            My concern though is at each stage where we're confronted
with new technology we have to go through this process yet again. It happened with the printing press.  It happened with film and
then took four decades and longer for practical application, for
that to get reversed.  With broadcasting it first was regulated in
1927 as a scarce medium and then again that law was rewritten in
1934 and hasn't been rewritten since.  We're on the verge of a
rewrite, and that's what some of the telecommunications legislation
is about, but it doesn't abandon these concepts of government
control.  In fact it strengthens them and would extend them to the
newer technologies, whether it's fiber optics or something else, or
direct broadcast satellites for that matter.
          So I think that it's time to recognize that all speech is
the same under the First Amendment, and that the means of transmis-
sion don't make any difference whatsoever.  The fact that some
communications may have social force or power to change things
isn't a reason again for government to get involved.  That's why
the printing press was controlled.  That's why we adopted a First
Amendment in the first place.  And so the method of transmission
shouldn't make any difference whatsoever.
          The other thing that I think is fairly dangerous when
it's handled in the way that it's currently being considered is
that if things have moved slowly in the past wait until they become
the subject of a regulatory agency.  Having worked at the FCC I can
tell you a lot about that.  Things move much more slowly in the
regulatory state.  We are controlled by endless numbers of defini-
tions, and once you fit into a regulatory pigeonhole, a defini-
tional pigeonhole, you will stay there either until the courts turn
it over, knock it down, or until some sixty years later or however
many years later someone decides that that may have been a bad idea
in the first place.
          So I'm very concerned about carving these things into the
stone of legislation and then using that as the model for extending
government control over communications.  The whole idea of having
this network, this notion of instantaneous communication, is to
free up speech and not to create jurisdictional reasons to exert
greater control.  For that reason I am particularly concerned about
the Digital Telephony Bill that was just passed.  It was passed by
both houses of Congress in early October, and it does require tele-
phone companies to cooperate and assist law enforcement authorities
in wiretapping and issues like that.            In some ways it doesn't change the preexisting state of
the law.  In 1986 there was a rewrite of the Federal Wiretapping
Law that essentially brought that into, recognized, digital
communications.  It did require that kind of cooperation.  This
really more clarifies that rather than imposes a new obligation. The other clarifying part of it thankfully is that it says that
federal authorities have to get a warrant before they can do it. But it still maintains the essential premise of governmental
control, and I think that what we need to working toward is an
understanding that the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment,
because they work together, must be recognized for all technologies
as we move on into the future.
          I'll just say one or two more things because I know I've
taken a bit of your time, just to say that if nothing else, because
again I've been talking legal structures because that's the world
that I work in, but if nothing else it would helpful if people could get an understanding that when they're approaching a new type
of communications they're not approaching something fundamentally
different, and I'll give you two examples that I think tend to
underscore that.            One is a recent action by an export office in the
Department of State that denied an export license for the disk
version of a book on encryption, while the print version is freely
available and as a matter of fact 20,000 copies have been sold
worldwide.  Now the justification is that when you put it on a
computer disk it is somehow different and can be disseminated
differently when of course anyone can take the print version and
key it in and you have the same thing.  But that's one example of
where the understanding of what the communication is, what the
information is, is treated differently under the law because it is
in a different technological form.            Another has to do with a recent case involving a regional
office of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, an
action that ended closing down a men's only and women's only
computer bulletin system at Santa Rosa Junior College because of
allegations of sexual harassment and people saying generally not
nice things on this computer bulletin board.  But as part of this
ruling, and it's still being worked out, it isn't final yet, the
Office of Civil Rights took the position that a computer bulletin
board is not subject to the same free speech rights as if you were
talking about a physical bulletin board or if you were talking
about the campus newspaper.  It is somehow different.            I think these are very dangerous beginnings, very
dangerous trends, and unless we address these questions both in
terms of our understanding of what's going on and in terms of the
law then what we've seen in history will be perpetuated and it will
take a far longer time, decades, if we're lucky, for that to be
sorted out.  So that's why I think this is one of the most
important topics that we could talk about today, because I think
that communications has been historically a vital force in society
and it's only going to get more important.  Thank you.

@_subject: Censorship In Cyberspace 3/6 
MODERATOR:  What about the children?  Our new technolo-
gies expose children to information and ideas from all over the
world.  Some of it is information.  Some of it is misinformation. Should we take steps to restrict this access?  Ellen Lafontaine
will explore this area with examples of educational alternatives to
          LAFONTAINE:  Thank you, Joan.  I have a little cold, so
I hope that you can hear me.  I hope I won't cough halfway through.
          As we all know, cyberspace or the InterNet is a very
popular subject today.  When one adds the issue of censorship it
becomes even more compelling and controversial.  Today you will be
presented with the legal, political and technical viewpoints of the
censorship debate.  However, I contend that while these perspec-
tives are illuminating there is the danger of missing the far more
important issue of the right to free speech for students in its
application to this medium of technology.            This issue of censorship is not solely one of a technical
nature, for instance how to block access to pornographic material
and banned books.  A cursory glance at the variety of news groups
and conferences on the InterNet may seem, depending upon your point
of view, as either provocative or offensive.  For example, it is
possible to obtain an erotic article from the news group
ALT.REC.SEX.WITH.OTHERS, or a few passages from Huck Finn, a banned
book in some school districts.  Indeed many educators and parents
spend a lot of time worrying over whether Susan or Jimmy will
accidentally read material that's not appropriate for their age.
          However, restricting access to news groups and
conferences dealing with objectionable content matter is simply a
subtractive strategy, subtractive in the sense of a withdrawal. The real issue instead involves the much great social challenge of
placing in our schools this technological medium that has the
potential to encourage student dialogue on any number of controver-
sial issues.            Increasingly our schools have greater access to the
InterNet.  We can expect that some educators and parents will
perceive its introduction as dangerous as rolling a Trojan Horse
into the classroom.  Therefore a different and far more interesting
approach to the issue of censorship is to focus upon the students
themselves and their right to free expression in the classroom.  To
us this is an additive strategy, allowing our students to confront
difficult realities both on a local level and a global scale and to
successfully engage in the necessary conflicts that will inevitably
          The questions that we need to ask are:  Can we tolerate
and actively promote the desanitizing of the curriculum by allowing
this new form of communication and inquiry into the classroom?  Can
we encourage our students to pursue the right to free expression
and not turn their backs on controversy when it ensues?  And
lastly, can we create a critical literacy among students so that
they are not only better prepared to confront the issues of
tomorrow but also can be instrumental in changing or improving
today's world for the better?
          To illustrate my point I would like to tell a story drawn
from a paper that I coauthored with Professor Dennis Sayers of New
York University.  The research was originally compiled for his
forthcoming book, Brave New Schools.  The story concerns the use of a global learning network in an English class at a high school in
Long Island.  The network, supported by the Copland Family Fund, is
called IERN, which stands for International Educational and
Resource Network.  The IERN network allows students to use telecom-
munications to carry out projects with students from other parts of
the world.  The students at Cold Spring Harbor use the network to
collect articles written by students from many different countries
for a magazine called The Contemporary.  Although produced at the
high school, The Contemporary is so much a part of the IERN network
that it is considered an official publication of that network.  As
its editors write, "The Contemporary is a student news magazine,
international in scope, that aims to provide teenagers with a way
to learn about issues of national and global importance as the
first step toward understanding how youth can have an impact on the
direction taken by our world."  And one point I'd like to make. These are 14 to 17-year-olds that write, so I think you're all
going to be very impressed by the level of their writing.
          Even though at times these issues of national and global
importance were controversial in nature, this didn't stop the
student editors from writing about them.  However they were soon to
find out that encouraging a debate on one of these controversial
issues would lead to not one but two conflicts and near losses of
their right to free expression, and surprisingly from two entirely
different directions.            It all began with the Middle East section of the January
1994 issue, which contained writings from Palestinian and Israeli
teachers and students.  Kristin Lucas, the 11th grade editor of the
special sections, recounts her original motivations for collecting
the writings.  "At the start of my project my goal was to inform
students around the world about recent developments in the long
lived Middle East crisis.  I set out with the belief that students
from Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories needed to
realize the similarities in their hopes and fears in order to pave
the way for a more peaceful future."            Using electronic mail and video send (ph), Kristin and
the other students editors were able to collect several pieces of
writing from both Palestinian and Israeli students and teachers. It was their intention to pair these writings next to one another
in the Middle Eastern section for maximum impact.  However, as they
were going to press one of the Palestinian teachers, upon learning
of Kristin's decision to intersperse the Israeli and Palestinian
writings, and also objecting to some of the content in Kristin's
introductory article, threatened to pull every one of the
Palestinian writings.  Kristin and her fellow editors were
astounded.  She spent seven periods of two school days trying to
reach a compromise that wouldn't breach her right to free expres-
sion.  At the end they published all of the letters, but in
separate sections of the magazine.            This was a disappointing compromise for Kristin and her
co-editors.  In their opinion the initial attempt to foster a
student dialogue on a controversial topic had failed.  So they
decided to exploit the technology to an even greater extent. Instead of relying upon letters and articles sent through elec-
tronic mail, they opened a conference area on the network hoping
this time for a more extensive, true back and forth student
dialogue.  Little were they to know that world events would sadly
offer them one more Middle Eastern controversy.  As we can all
recall, on February 23, 1994 Baruch Goldstein murdered 50 Arabs and
wounded many others at a mosque in Hebron (ph).  This massacre
triggered many Palestinian demonstrations on the streets of the
occupied territories, which led to beatings and killings by Israeli
authorities and reprisal murders by members of extremist groups on
both sides.  As a result extensive curfews were enforced and
schooling for the Palestinians was suspended.            Thus the resulting turmoil provoked a flurry of letters
back and forth on many topics, one of which was the Western media
coverage of the events.  As one 12-year-old writes, Ranin Kiryan
(ph), "The Western media is always at the scene when both Israelis
and Arabs are killed, and the coverage is much more in favor of the
Palestinian side in the opinion of Israel's.  My opinion in general
is that the Palestinians deserve a country."  A Palestinian student
disagreed with Ranin Kiryan.  "I believe the Western media is not
always at the scene when both Arabs and Jews are killed, and the
coverage is in favor of the Israelis.  But it's not important that
the media covers this or that.  What is important is that the
killings stop.  I respect your opinion that the Palestinians
deserve a State."
          These two excerpts out of a handful of many demonstrate
the enormous power of telecommunications to foster student partici-
pation in an open and free dialogue.  These students are learning
tolerance by respecting each other's opinions on a very controver-
sial topic.  They are communicating in a real fashion about issues
of social justice.            One Israeli student who wished to remain anonymous,
likely because his or her opinion would have sparked debate among
his or her Israeli classmates, disputed the frequent press descrip-
tions of Baruch Goldstein as an insane killer who acted alone.  He
or she says, "I believe that the massacre was not the action of a
lone lunatic but one taken by a gunman acting under the influence
of a radical minority group.  This group deserves to be condemned,
but the entire Israeli population should not be blamed.  Similarly,
the extremists among the Palestinians should be condemned but not
all the Palestinian people."  Truthfully, how many adults can
master that concept, the few do not represent the many, as our
anonymous contributor obviously has?  Moreover, how many could
acquire this understanding on such a controversial issue so close
to home?            Clearly these excerpts from the students' writings
demonstrate the success of Kristin's original goals, to promote
dialogue on a hotly contested issue in the Middle East with the
hopes of illuminating common ground for peaceful coexistence.  The
Contemporary included these and many other letters in the May 1994
issue.  There were also letters from students in other countries
sharing their opinions and applying lessons from what they were
reading to their own reality at home.  Phoebe McDunna, a student
  "In my country we have many people from
different backgrounds and we have grown to communicate and to
accept everyone.  This all sounds like Australia is a very loving
and understanding country, but the sad truth is our native
Australians, the Aborigines, are the last ones to become accepted
and to be treated equally."            Thus the debate that Kristin had sparked on the political
turmoil in the Middle East led to students in faraway countries
extrapolating lessons about the expansionist policies at the roots
of their own countries' origins.  So in going to press with this
final issue of the school year, Kristin and her fellow students
were pleased that they had achieved the goal of using telecommu-
nications for opening and sustaining an extensive dialogue on a
controversial issue.  Kristin writes, "I've had the opportunity to
accomplish what many other students may never have a chance to
attempt.  Even though I don't have the influence to reverse the
sometimes harsh sentiments of these people, I would like to come
away thinking that at least I did something to help the peace
process along."            Unfortunately Kristin had no idea of the new conflict for
the May issue, this time much closer to home.  Peter Copland (ph)
is the head of the Copland Family Foundation that has supported the
IERN network since its inception.  His vision was to explore the
potential of telecommunications to give youth a voice in shaping
and improving their world.  To this end he established IERN,
providing funding from the Copland Family Foundation to underwrite
the network during its formative years until it established a clear
identity and had become self sufficient.  This support took many
forms, ranging from assisting in covering the cost of telecom-
munications for some schools in North America and in other
countries to assure cultural diversity in the networking projects
and to contributing to special projects such as the Holocaust
Genocide Project, with a range of funding demands including
publications and study trips to Poland and Israel.            So when Peter Copland asked to meet with the editorial
staff and the faculty adviser at Cold Spring High to voice objec-
tions to their coverage in the Middle East sections they were all
very surprised.  In his view, however, the coverage was biased
toward the Palestinian point of view.  He also felt that the
writings from the adult contributors was a major departure from the
original mission of the student magazine.  Although he insisted
that he didn't want to limit their editorial freedom he felt that
The Contemporary's designation as an official annual IERN project
should be reconsidered, and the controversial nature of the topics
it covered might generate disagreements within IERN and jeopardize
the willingness of some schools, for example in Israel and the
U.S., to continue participating in the network.           So the student editors met and drafted a response to
Copland's concerns, and I'll quote a few passages.  It was a very
long letter, but I think this is very important:       We sought to give all interested parties a chance to
     state their views and respond to each other.  Did the
     contributors hear one another?  Well, most seemed to
     listen but a few seemed to hear very well.  Did we try to
     make the Middle East section a safe place to conduct such
     a discussion?  Yes, but we realize that when feelings run
     as hot as they do in the Middle East there may be no such
     thing as a safe place to discuss any subject.  Does this
     mean that we did not make a contribution to the resolu-
     tion of the problems discussed?  No.  We feel progress in
     this instance ought to be measured simply by the fact
     that the contending parties at least talked to each other
     and read what each other was feeling and thinking.      Finally, dialogue, no matter how contentious it may seem,
     is the first step toward resolving any problem.
          These responses demonstrate the remarkably high level of
critical thinking generated by engaging in such projects on a
global learning network over the InterNet.  The students developed
a working knowledge of how to confront the possible loss of their
right to free speech.  Once again they negotiated a compromise by
relinquishing the annual IERN project status for The Contemporary
and incorporating a disclaimer for each issue.  The final result
was a conceptual awareness of the relationship of free expression
and of the media of telecommunication that went far beyond the
issue of keeping objectionable material out of young peoples'
          In closing I will quote one student's real understanding
of the individual right to free expression:  "I think free and open
communication is a wonderful thing.  Perhaps with this experience
some students will prize dialogue more dearly in the future.  Hope-
fully if we try to understand each other more we might be more
willing to talk things out instead of going to war over them."
          Thank you.

@_subject: Censorship In Cyberspace 4/6 
MODERATOR:  Thank you very much, Ellen.  Now.  Can we
imagine what it would be like if there were no traffic cops in
communication?  Well, we don't really need to, because no laws
control the InterNet and no one owns it.  How does it work?  Gerard
Van Der Leun, who was the first Communications Director of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, finds that free speech and civil
liberties are, as he puts it, "the default state of the global
InterNet," and he will tell us why and how.
          VAN DER LEUN:  Hi.  My name is Boswell at BELL.COM (ph),
and I'm a Cyberholic.  I started out chipping with an RCA dumb
monitor at 300 baud, and now I'm looking to start mainlining off a
slip connection.  There's just never enough for me.            I first sort of became I guess aware of the potential of
this when I was a book editor in the mid 1980's at Houghton-Mifflin
in Boston.  Through a series of events I no longer recall I bumped
into this woman named Elizabeth Ferrarini (ph) who was verging on
a functional illiterate but wanted to write a book about her
experiences on the fledgling nets then.  I think she was one of the
early members of The Source.  And she used to log on with the
handle "THIS IS A NAKED LADY."  So those of you with any experience
on the Net know what kind of E-mail and sends this starts to draw
to you while you're on the Net.  Her keystroke cup will runneth
over in no time.            Actually knowing nothing about this I ended up
(a) commissioning the book, (b) rewriting it, and (c) publishing
it.  It became a book called Infomania: Life in the On-Line World. I think it was sort of the first book about this subject, and
dutifully sank into obscurity by being the first in about 1987.            A couple of years later in another incarnation I was at
a tag sale and I bought a box for $60.  It was an RCA dumb monitor
with a 300 baud modem, and you could put about ten phone numbers in
it.  And I took it home, sort of figured it out from the manual, I
went to Computer Shopper, found a BBS with my area code on it and
bingo -- I was in Dave's Cave, a Fidonet (ph) node, looking for
filthy stories and other things.  And then it came to me one night
in an epiphanous moment that you could actually with a telephone
connection basically get things onto the disk of your computer you
didn't have to type in yourself.  Ah, revelation.  This was nice. And from then, you know, just like Topsy the addiction simply grew
until I sort of found myself floating around the InterNet for many
years now, and actually in different years I've become one of the
rarer breeds of people on the Net.  I actually manage to make a
modest living out of it rather than just shoveling lots of connect
time dollars back into it.            In the course of this I guess I stumbled into a system on
the West Coast, if anything can be said to be anywhere in cyber-
space, called The Well.  Most people that have been on the Nets for
some time have a vague idea that the Well is actually one of these
systems whose impact is bigger than its userbase, and while on The
Well I bumped into other denizens of cyberspace such as Mnemonic,
who is actually Mike Godwin, one of the legal beagles for the
Electronic Frontier Foundation in Washington, and also into this
very strange, slightly seedy cowpoke named Barlow, who had with his
palaver actually talked Mitch Kapur (ph) into parting with some
hard change to fund and found the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
which at its inception was actually a very exciting organization to
be involved with since they basically wanted to defend young hack-
ing kids against big crackdowns by Feds.  I'm always looking for a
good game of Feds and Heads in my life.  I like to play with the
Heads.            You know, the EFF later devolved into what's now sort of
a wonk tank and luncheon society down in Washington, D.C., but that
was after my time, or I should say my time ended when it evolved
into lunching with lobbyists.  But since then I've gone on to be I
guess a gadfly around the Net and on The Well to people.  On The
Well I run a conference that's called, well, I run two conferences. One is called Z (ph), which is basically a digest of all the other
conferences, the best and the worst, what have you.  And then the
conference I'm proudest of is called The Weird Conference, and The
Weird Conference's rule is that we don't have any rules, and you
can say anything you want and nothing is forbidden.  And nothing is
ever censored except sometimes by me in a purely arbitrary fashion
to keep people aware of what censorship feels like.  It's true. Boswell will sometimes just log on and say, "Well, I'm going to
erase your comment because I just don't like it."  Checheche cht --
gone.  What?  What?  There it is.
          Anyway, I was just sort of looking at the Net and I've
been thinking about censorship, and I've been through Operation Sun
Devil and I've seen Hacker Crackdown and I have Digital Telepathy
and I'm aware -- I'm sure Mr. Zimmermann will enlighten you of what
can happen to someone who goes out to play on the Nets when it's an
essential Net tool.  I mean you need to pack a lunch and have a
legal fund.  Nevertheless, I would say to you today, not just to
this small group but almost to anyone, that my basic state is one
of really intense optimism.  I think the war against censorship is
effectively over and we've won.  I think what we're going to be
dealing with now in policy areas and programming areas is what I
would call mopping up operations and attempts by local and global
authority to put the genie back in the bottle.  But it's gone.  I
mean it's out there.  The Net is out there.
          The Net has, in my mind at least, the Net has no center. It has no owners, none that I know of.  It respects no borders.  I
mean, you know, Australia is just a domain name to the Net.  It
doesn't really matter where you are.  English is pretty much its
default language, much like air traffic control.            I'm sure there's going to be a lot of waves of efforts to
limit and otherwise control this medium.  I would think, if you
look at the growth statistics on the Net, if you look at the number
of people coming on and you look at the kind of minds you're
dealing with when you're dealing with the Net, I mean you are not
dealing with the left side of the Bell curve when you're hitting on
the Net.  I mean you are dealing with people who are bright enough
to get there, because it isn't easy.  You're dealing with people
who are really sharp about this new technology, because some of
them write the programs that it runs on.            You're also dealing, way at the bottom of the InterNet
you're dealing with software, you're dealing with Send Mail, you're
dealing with Read This, you're dealing with a lot of assorted
software that all nodes have to have to talk to each other, and if
you really look at that code and say, "Who wrote this code?  Who
wrote the thing that -- who created the water in which all this
information swims?"  Well, I think if you look at those original
people a lot of them were basically anarcho-crypto heads that
happened to be programmers and just wanted to, you know, send jokes
to each other and talk about computers.            I think it's --, you know, the default state of the Net
is absolute freedom.  In fact it's to such an extent that a large
part of the Net is sort of set up to recognize attempts at censor-
ship as system damage and simply route around it.  I want to send
pedophile memoirs from site A to site C.  Well, you know, it's
supposed to take the most efficient route and that's through site
B.  Well, this happens to be Jerry Falwell's machine.  He decides
what he wants on his machine in his "home."  That's fine with me. So down it goes.  Whup!  Sorry.  We don't take any pedophile stuff
through this site.  Boom!  We'll kick it to D.  D doesn't care. Boom!  You know.  I don't care if Jerry -- you know, it's fine with
me what people have in their home.            It's more complicated than this obviously and there's
going to be a lot of argument and a lot of, you know, shouting back
and forth and a lot of federal regulations passed and all of that,
but I think what's happening here is we -- you know, what is the
Net?  The Net is basically the medium, and the Net reminds me of
this book that was published at the end of the '70's where a man
said, "Well, my idea for a really great book is a book of 350 pages
and there's nothing on any of the pages.  So I'm going to call it
the Nothing Book."  And everyone said, "What a terrible commercial
idea."  Well, of course he published the Nothing Book and now you
go into any bookstore there's, you know, a big case of blank books.
          What we've got with the Net is we have, fundamentally we
have the linking of millions and millions of hard drives.  This
fulfills the dream of every computer junkie in the world, that you
have infinite drive space.  You basically have infinite drive
space.  The Net is really -- what it is, is what we make it, every-
body individually.  It's like sort of the largest group hack in
history.  I think second to the phone company it's certainly the
largest machine that's ever been built.  Some people will get
rather mystical.  Under certain chemicals I'll get mystical and
tell you it's the emergence of the World Mind.  And like anything
in the World Mind, it's got a lot of dark areas in it.  Well, we'll
just have to live with our dark fantasies as we live with our
better deeds.  To deny them is not really a good idea.
          I think one of the things that we're feeling right now
with the immense growth is we're feeling three fundamental tensions
within the Net, and I would also propose to you that for each ten-
sion the Net also has the capacity to alleviate that tension.  I
think the first tension is between the concepts which can exist in
a single human mind, in a single human society, that on the one
hand ideas, ideas, need to be free.  They need to be exchanged. They need to have no limit to the ability to make them baroque or
make them fresh or make them new.  But at the same time the same
mind that has ideas that need to be free, we also hold within
ourselves beliefs that need to be protected.  Censorship is bad. I believe that.  I need to protect that idea.  That's central to
something important to me.  As an idea, censorship is bad?  That
may not be such a fundamentally true idea.  Maybe there are some
cases that people can make that censorship is good.  All right. But my belief needs to be protected, although my ideas need to be
          Well, how does the Net deal with that?  The Net, or
UseNet, which is sort of this large machine, this large sort of
Mother Ship of interest groups that rides upon the vast InterNet
ocean, basically just creates infinite areas in which all beliefs
can exist and all ideas can be free.  And if you wander into an
area with a certain belief -- say you wander into -- oh, the sex
areas are always good because that's where everyone gets excited. You wander into ALT.SEX.MEMBERS OF THE SAME SEX.  MOTSS.  And you
say, as we see in that group every month, you enter a message with
the stirring headline, "FAGS MUST DIE."  Well, it will be about
four nanoseconds before about thirty other people will flame you
hairless.  Your I.D. will be exposed either in its strength or its
weakness by thirty other minds working on that -- whew.
          At the same time you might want to say, "I believe that
everyone should worship Jesus.  Christ.  Christian."  Right?  Well,
you might sort of wander over to the Muslim and you might not feel
too comfortable in the ALT.MUSLIM area doing that, but the Net has
created, the wonderful alt groups have created ALT.CHRISTNET.  They
even have ALT.CHRISTNET.SEXUALITY.  So what happens is when people
feel a need to have a belief area in which their beliefs can be
protected they'll just create an area and anybody who wanders in
there that's not quite in the program, just flamed hairless and
thrown out.  That's all right, because you can wander over, you
know, to another area or to a "secret moderated (ph) mailing list"
that says, you know, "Kill Catholics Mailing List."  Okay?  We're
going to talk with six other people on the Net about killing
Catholics.  That's a good idea.  We'll just all be in that room
together.  You know, other people just put you in their Kill file
and you're out of here.           So the Net sort of resolves those two, that particular
tension set.  Next tension set, tension set number two, is
information.  Hmmmm.  Information wants to be free.  All right. Information wants to be free.  True.  True thing.  All information
wants to be free, and we don't really want to pay connect time
charges to get it, either.  On the other hand information is
generated by people, and people need to be paid, okay?  Because,
you know, the information environment that makes my apartment, the
landlord wants to be paid for that solid piece of information I
live in so I need to get something coming in the other way.
          Well, I would propose to you that the way that both we
can have free information and also have information which returns
some kind of money or token back to its creator is probably at hand
within the InterNet within the crypto environment.  In other words
I get a little sample of something.  If I want to have the whole
thing maybe I have to send $5 down the line on my Master Charge in
order to get the key back.  Mr. Zimmermann could probably talk a
little bit more specifically about how cryptography and things like
that probably hold the key to a real kind of commercial series of
transactions over the InterNet.  So that is sort of the Net.
          But on the one hand we have, you have to consider there's
two things going on on the InterNet.  One is speech, and people
feel ASCII is speech and if you don't think it's speech say that on
the Net and they'll probably come back to you and hand you your
ASCII on a platter.  Which empowers individuals.  That's why we
love it.  At the same time the other question is how are we going
to maintain copyright?  Because people feel that maintaining copy-
right disempowers individuals.  Correct.  Copyright was not created
by the United States Government back in the dawn of government to
empower individuals.  That was a side effect.  Copyright was
created because people saw right away that unless people uld
enjoy the fruits of their labor there wouldn't be quite so much
invention within society and it was held to be a good thing to spur
invention within society.  I think that's probably the fundamental
reason for copyright.  And I think again, you know, the Net will
give us the tools to do that.  The Net has been as a global machine
and through a pact that nobody intended and nobody created an
extremely, surprisingly responsive organism to solving its own
problems.  They get solved on a pretty fast track.            The final tension is sort of what is going on on the Net
all the time in the way the Net only mirrors what we are and what
we make it and who we are as a society, and that is the tension
between the desire for liberty and the fear of liberty that leads
us to yearn for some kind of authority.  You see this polarity move
along on the Net all the time.  You see sort of libertarian --
libertarian anarchists are very big on the Net, are here, and then
there's control freaks.  They're also here.  Anybody who's been out
there for a while sees these people go at each other all the time.
          Then of course we have Net Heads, or Heads, whatever, and
of course we have Feds, you know.  And Heads and Feds have been
playing games on the Net now for almost a decade.  There's no
reason to think they're going to stop.  They sort of need each
other.  The Christ and the Antichrist in an eternal conflict.  But
meanwhile everybody else is just, you know, passing recipes back
and forth and, you know, here's my, you know, here's my secret
pedophile journal over here.  Everybody's -- here's how you crochet
something.  Here's some code.  Here's a filthy E of me and my dog.
Just download, send money, state preferences.
          Then of course you have the anarchists, like I am.  Hey! No rules, nothing.  Let's just do it.  You know, you're there.  You
are free.  Just assume it and act on it, and -- THE NET POLICE. "You know, you're really a Nazi for saying it that way."  In fact
the famous Mneumonics law on the Net says that the longer any Net
argument goes on, the more, the more ready you are to put us into

@_subject: Censorship In Cyberspace 5/6 
MODERATOR:  Well.  Getting back to censorship.  I'm not
quite sure what Phil Zimmermann is going to talk about, but I have
a feeling that unlike some computer experts that I've talked to who
think that the wide dissemination of encryption software like Phil
Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy make the Digital Telephony Act no
big deal because all the government will get is static when they
tap in on these new phones, I have a feeling that he is a little
bit more suspicious of the possibility of restrictive government
action.  So perhaps we can now find out what we might loosely call
"the censorship crunch" (ph) and what is going to happen in it. Phil Zimmermann.
          ZIMMERMANN:  How many people here know what PGP is? Okay.  How many people don't?  Okay.  Looks like we've got about
half and half maybe.  Well, I'm not here to talk about PGP mostly
but rather government policies, but I'll just talk about it a
little bit.
          Cryptography is the art of making secret writing.  It's
been around for a long time.  The problem is if I want to send you
a message I use a key to scramble that message up and then you have
to use the same key to unscramble it.  The problem is how do I tell
you what the key is?  Do I tell you over the telephone what the key
is to unscramble the message?  If I do that then it can be inter-
cepted, and so that's the problem with cryptography.  In fact that
has been the problem with cryptography since the days of Julius
Caesar.            But in the late 1970's some mathematicians at Stanford
and M.I.T. devised another kind of cryptography that solves that
problem of key distribution.  It's called Public Key Cryptography,
and the way it works is that there are really two keys.  One
encrypts, the other decrypts.  As a matter of fact the two keys
have a kind of yin-yang relationship so that either one will
decrypt what the other one encrypts.  This means that if you
generate a pair of these keys, everybody generates a unique pair of
keys for themselves, the keys have this mathematical relationship
like this.  They're kind of like Siamese twins.  And you separate
them at birth and you broadcast one of them to the world and put it
on all your business cards and in your telephone book and, you keep
the other one secret.  Then if anyone wants to send you a message
they encrypt it with the key that you published.  That's your
public key.  But you're the only person in the world that can
decrypt that message with the corresponding secret key.            This solves the problem of key distribution.  You don't
need secure channels to distribute keys beforehand.  With the old
way that cryptography used to work before Public Key Cryptography
came along, you needed a secure channel for the prior distribution
of keys.  Well, if you had a secure channel for the prior distribu-
tion of keys then why do you need to use any cryptography at all? You know, I remember my Mom used to tell me when I was a kid that
if you sprinkle salt on a bird's tail you can catch the bird.  And
for years I wondered about that.  You know, maybe there's something
about salt and birds.  But I finally figured out why you can catch
a bird if you can sprinkle salt on its tail.  So if you could get
a secure channel to distribute keys, then you've got the communica-
tion problem solved.  But maybe you could just send your message
through that secure channel.
          Well, with Public Key Cryptography you don't need any
secure channels.  So if you combine that with the technologies of
the Information Age, modems, personal computers, fax machines,
etc., then you have a really good synergistic combination of tech-
nologies that makes it possible for the first time for cryptography
to affect millions of people in their everyday lives.  In the old
days before Public Key Cryptography you would have to do this prior
distribution of keys.  Governments didn't mind doing this, because
they could put a guy on a plane to Moscow with a satchel handcuffed
to his wrist carrying keys to the Embassy there.  They don't mind
paying the salary of somebody and buying them an airline ticket to
do that.  But if you're going to talk to your cousin in Colorado
you're not going to do it by sending a courier carrying keys.  So
cryptography never had a chance to affect the lives of millions of
people until Public Key Cryptography was invented and personal
computers and the Information Age came along.
          Well, how many people here don't know what the Clipper
Chip is, or haven't heard of it?  Or just don't know what it is? Okay.  I see almost everybody does.  I'll just say a couple of
words, but I'll abbreviate my remarks about the Clipper Chip.  The
Clipper Chip is an encryption device that the government is making
for us that they hope we'll put in all of our telephones.  It
encrypts our telephone conversations so we can talk to other tele-
phones that also have the Clipper Chip.  The trick though is that
at the time of manufacture the government puts the keys for encryp-
tion and decryption in these chips, and they keep a copy of these
keys for wiretap purposes.
          You know, I haven't talked to an audience where it wasn't
immediately obvious to everybody that there's a problem with that
as far as -- you know, I was talking on the phone the other day
with the General Counsel of the NSA.  I'm going to be debating him
next week in Los Angeles and so we were talking about what we were
going to do in the debate.  And I made the remark that there is a
difference in attitude between people on the inside and people on
the outside.  What I was talking about of course was inside the
government, and in particular the law enforcement and the intel-
ligence agencies.  He said something like, that I was assuming a
lot to think that it was just people on the inside who were for the
Clipper Chip, and, you know, I just -- I don't remember running
into too many people on the outside that felt differently.            The government is trying to at first not pass legislation
to make us use the Clipper Chip but rather to use government spend-
ing power to make an awful lot of Clipper Chips deployed.  They're
using government spending power both to buy Clipper Phones that
have the Clipper Chip in it and then they're going to use govern-
ment spending power to require government contractors to buy
Clipper Phones if they want to talk to the government.  Well, this
kind of gets the production lines going and brings the cost down. It makes it cheap enough so that it can be used more and more by
the general population, the related chips to the Clipper Chip.
          It's not just the Clipper Chip.  There's a whole series
of chips the government's making.  Capstone (ph) is another chip. They have this little card, a PCMCIA card.  It's something that
slips into your personal computer, into your notebook computer,
that they're calling the Tessera Card, and the Tessera Card has got
something similar to the Clipper Chip in it and it can do digital
signatures, and they want you to file your taxes with it electron-
ically.  You know, it's funny.  They call it the Tessera Card.  Now
I looked up "tessera" in the dictionary.  I've got one of those
giant, thick dictionaries.  And tessera is a name that ancient Rome
had for these little cards that were kind of like that, the size
and shape of a Tessera Card, kind of a tile.  And it was an
identity card.  And slaves were required to carry it, and if you
didn't they could chop your head off or something awful like that. And I thought what a brilliant stroke of naming, you know?  Who
thought of that?
          I was talking to Clint Brooks, the Assistant to the
Director of the NSA, in Los Angeles a couple of months back.  We
were on a panel together to argue this point.  And he said that he
was the one who named the Clipper Chip, and he was thinking that
for these things, for example the Clipper Chip may not have been
the best choice of names for it because people think of clipper as
clipping the wings of democracy.  Of course cryptographers like to
rearrange letters and things because we like to do that, so we kind
of just moved a couple of letters around and called it the Cripple
Chip.            So anyway what they're trying to do is to use government
spending power to change the facts on the ground.  Not by legis-
lation, but by changing the facts on the ground.  We don't have any
laws requiring us to use 120 volt AC power, but we do.  When was
the last time you saw a 48 volt vacuum cleaner?  It's the tyranny
of the installed base.  That's why, you know, all computers are
Windows or MS-DOS computers or Macintoshes.  It's something that,
if it's out there and it's -- deployment wins, in other words. Well, the government is not the only ones that can change the facts
on the ground.  I can change the facts on the ground.  I've already
done that to some extent.  And I'm going to do it some more.
          You know if we wake up one morning with 100 million
Clipper Phones installed it's going to be too late to worry about
changing government policy.  It doesn't matter who we elect
President.  We could have somebody elected President that says,
"Elect me and I promise to get rid of all these Clipper Phones." It won't do any good at all.  The installed base and the technology
infrastructure is more powerful than a government, is more powerful
than government policy.  There is no way we could change, you know,
our power standards.  There is no way that a government can decide
that we're not going to use PC's anymore or something like that. So that's what they hope to do with Clipper.
          Well right now PGP, Pretty Good Privacy, a program that
I wrote that does E-mail encryption using Public Key Cryptography
and using other algorithms that were chosen from the academic
literature, the most powerful algorithms, the ones that had been
the best peer reviewed, not my own home grown invented algorithms,
because those had not been through the kind of peer review it takes
to stand up to major governments.  PGP uses the best algorithms in
the academic literature.            PGP has become the most widely used program in the world
for E-mail encryption, bar none.  Nothing else comes even close. It's used all over the world.  It's used in Burma by political
opposition groups in Burma, freedom fighters in Burma.  Burma has
an absolutely wretched government.  They torture and kill thousands
of people.  They have a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate in custody in
Burma.  They're being trained to use PGP in Burma in jungle
training camps on portable computers.  They take this knowledge to
other jungle training camps and teach them too.  I talked to
somebody who's connected with those groups and they tell me that
it's raised morale quite a bit because before PGP came along
captured documents would lead directly to the arrest and torture
and execution of entire families.            I talked with a guy who was a human rights worker in
Central America.  This was at the offices of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington.  They
have a human rights group there.  And he told me that he was
documenting atrocities, death squads, and he encrypts his files
with PGP.  But if the government found his files they would go and
kill all his witnesses, probably not very fast either.  PGP is
saving lives there.  I gave him a few pointers on good disk
hygiene, how to keep his stuff clean, not just -- using PGP alone
isn't enough.
          Well, my next project is a secure voice project.  I just
a couple of nights ago spent about a half an hour talking to one of
my lawyers over it.  I haven't put the encryption in yet.  It does
it all without encryption.  But you talk into your personal com-
puter with a SoundBlaster board that compresses your voice, digi-
tizes, compresses and encrypts your voice, sends it out through a
modem, and at the other end it reverses those steps.  So we have
this in test now, and I hope to release this through M.I.T.            M.I.T. is the current official publisher of PGP.  They
have what is known as an FTP (ph) site.  That's something on the
InterNet.  It means that anybody can get a file from their computer
by just reaching in and grabbing it.  But their FTP site is
structured in such a way that people outside the United States
can't do that.  They won't let people in from outside the United
States.  And not only that, even if you're inside the United States
it makes you answer a questionnaire saying that you are an
American, that you're not going to export this and promise not to
export it, and if you answer yes to the right questions it will let
you get PGP.  It didn't take very long before PGP showed up in
Europe after that, probably the same day.  Information wants to be
free.  Apparently that applies to free software more than anything
else.            PGP was published in June of 1991 initially.  It spread
like dandelion seeds blowing in the wind.  It didn't take very long
for it to spread to Europe.  Now M.I.T. with their lawyers and
their prestige is standing there publishing PGP in a way identical
to the encryption methods that they have used for publishing other
encryption software without any previous harassment by the federal
government on their doing it improperly, so they haven't gotten any
complaints about the way they're publishing PGP either.  All future
versions of PGP for the foreseeable future are going to be pub-
lished that way, so I hope that that will protect it.
          You [Corn-Revere] mentioned the Carr (ph) case.  There is
a book by Bruce Schneider called Applied Cryptography, and it has
encryption algorithms in it.  I liked it.  I like the book, the
preface of the book.  It's good.  He says, "There are two kinds of
cryptography in this world:  the kind that can prevent your kid
sister from reading your messages and the kind that can prevent
major governments from reading your messages.  This book is about
the latter."  You know, I wanted to steal that line for my book
because he stole many lines from my book in his book without an
attribution.  But that's okay because information wants to be free
and I like to be quoted even if he doesn't credit.  So I might call
up Bruce and ask him if I could put that in my preface for that
          A guy named Phil Carr took Bruce Schneider's book and
applied for an export license.  Actually he applied for a
commodities jurisdiction grant by the State Department that the
book can be -- that this item can be exported.  It was immediately
granted, because it was a book.  He then applied for a CJ, commo-
dities jurisdiction, to export a floppy disk containing the same
source code in the book, exactly byte for byte the same source
code, and they said no.  He has appealed it.  They said no again. Members of my own legal defense team are helping in his appeal. This is a multifront war.  You know, it's funny.  The number of
lawyer jokes that I've told has gone down in the last year.  I'm
starting to run into lawyers that are actually men of conscience. It's great.
          I'm about to publish the source code for PGP in a book
through M.I.T. Press.  Books may be exported.  I'm going to put it
in an OCR font.  We're going to apply for a commodities jurisdic-
tion.  We're probably going to get it, we presume.  If they don't
it's going to be the first time that it was ever declined for a
book and I think the press would probably make much of that.  They
probably know that, and they'll probably take that into their
calculations when they decide whether to grant this jurisdiction. If they do that then I'll also publish the secure voice project I'm
working on in a book through M.I.T. press and see what happens with
          The government is -- you know, I found this interesting,
the point about the different media affecting what the government
tries to say, what we have free speech in.  When telephones were
first invented there was an attitude in the government that you
could wiretap these things without a court order because they
didn't go into your house to do it.  It was not a violation of the
Fourth Amendment of unreasonable search and seizure because they
could just go down the block and attach their alligator clips to
the copper and that would be all that's needed.  So it took fifty
years of litigation to come up with the idea, or rather to
establish the idea that you need a court order to do a wiretap.           Well, we're facing the same thing again on the InterNet. When the Founding Fathers made the Constitution they didn't think
it was necessary to say that we had a right to a private conversa-
tion, because there was no technology at the time that made it hard
to have a private conversation.  If you want to just go talk behind
the barn with somebody you can say whatever you want and you don't
have to worry.  You don't have to codify it in the Constitution
that you're allowed to do that.  But now most of our conversations
are over copper or glass fiber.  Most of the people I talk to I've
never seen the face.  Maybe I will when they have those AT&T
things.  Have you ever had a $10,000 phone bill?  I know I don't
plan on installing a videophone in my house, because most of my
East Coast clients think that I wear a suit all the time.  They
don't know how I work.
          I ought to be able to whisper in your ear even if your
ear is 1,000 miles away.  And the government says I can't do that,
and that's what this whole thing is about, removing all of our
communication from vibrating air molecules to photons.  As more and
more of our traffic switches to electronic media it becomes more
and more lucrative to tap into it.  You can't read all the paper
mail.  The government can't read it all.  They can read one per-
son's paper mail if they target somebody, but they can't read it
all.  It's too much work to read everyone's paper mail.  But they
can read everyone's E-mail.  A single government computer could
scan every single piece of E-mail in the country, all of it, every
day, constantly.            Now I'm not saying they do that, but the technology
exists that they could.  And it could scan for subversive key words
and it could look for political troublemakers.  It could look for,
you know, the next anti-Vietnam War protesters or the next civil
rights protesters or the next environmental protesters, whatever
the issue of the day is.  Some unpopular war or something like that
could come up again, and they'll be able to find people who are
talking about it.  What could Joe McCarthy have done with these
kinds of tools?            What about traffic analysis?  What about all these E-mail
headers that say who it's from, who it's to, what the subject is
and so on?  I think this means that we should try to encrypt all of
our E-mail, because that's the only way to put it back the way it
was with paper mail.  In fact it puts it beyond that.  This is not
a black and white issue, because there are some downsides to this. There's never been a time in our history where it's been possible
to place information beyond the reach of the collective efforts of
society, but with modern cryptography you can.            You know, if you put information in a bank vault you can
always get it out with dynamite or welding torches or something
like that.  I remember in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, you
know, the dynamite, where it's raining money, you know?  Used
enough dynamite there, Butch?  You can always get that information
when it's physically protected.  But it's now possible for the
first time in history to place information beyond the reach of the
collective efforts of society.  The Gross National Product is not
enough to get it out.  It takes less energy to make a round trip to
the nearest solar system than it does to compute the prime factors
of some large composite number.
          I'm going to read you a quote that I got from a guy in
Latvia.  I always read this quote, so to those of you who've heard
me speak before I apologize for the repetition.  I got this, it was
sent to me by E-mail, on the day that Boris Yeltsin was shelling
his Parliament building in October of '93.  It says, "Phil, I wish
you to know.  Let it never be, but if dictatorship takes over
Russia your PGP is widespread from Baltic to Far East now and will
help democratic people if necessary.  Thanks."  That's the best
mail I've ever gotten on PGP.
          I want to read you a quote that Louis Fried (ph), FBI
Director Louis Fried, said recently at a conference on global
cryptography, on September 26th.  Steven Levy (ph) put a question
to him about what would happen if Clipper doesn't catch on, doesn't
get wide acceptance.  What would the FBI do in response to that. Would they outlaw other kinds of cryptography?            Here's a transcript of this:
     At first they didn't understand this question.  "You mean
     if the software that we write doesn't work?"  He said,
     "No.  If all you get is encrypted forms and you can't
     decipher them."  "The terms of encryption being a
     voluntary standard?"  Steven Levy said, "Yes."  The
     answer from Louis Fried, FBI Director, was, "Oh, yeah,
     definitely.  If five years from now we solve the access
     problem but what we're hearing is all encrypted, I'll
     probably if I'm still here be talking about that in a
     very different way.  The objective is the same.  The
     objective is for us to get those conversations, whether
     they're by an alligator clipped on ones and zeros [it's
     kind of garbled, I think] ... whoever they are, whatever
     they are, I need them."            It was obvious to everyone there who got a little bit
clearer view of it than the transcriber of the transcript here that
what he was talking about is that he would seek legislative relief, in other words outlaw other kinds of cryptography.  This is the
first time an Administration official has said something along
these lines.            Just a couple of weeks back the FBI Wiretap Bill passed
requiring phone companies to build all their equipment wiretap
ready.  The analogy to this is requiring new home builders to put
video cameras wired to a police station, with a promise to only
turn them on with a court order.  The assumption is that as we
build a new technology infrastructure we have to guarantee to the
police, to the government, that they will have access to our
private communications.            This is a dangerous precedent.  The FBI Wiretap Bill
passed without too much trouble, largely in part because of the
efforts of the Electronic Frontier Foundation I'm disappointed to
say.  John Curry Barlow (ph) made the remark that he could have
changed the vote of one of the Senators, and he told him to go
ahead and vote for it because it was in the EFF's view the best
deal they could get.  I think that we could have stopped it.  Last
year it was introduced and it didn't get a single sponsor.  This
year it had money in it for the phone companies to pay for the
infrastructure changes.  The phone companies stopped opposing it
for that reason.  We can't let some future legislation come down
that will slip by us that outlaws other kinds of cryptography. Cryptography is our one guarantor of privacy on the Information
Superhighway, the Infoban.  I was talking to a Swedish reporter
recently and I used the word "Infoban," and he said, "Oh, I wish
you wouldn't use that word.  It sounds too German.  So I understand
the new word is I-way.  I saw that in Wired.  It's a little too hip
for me.
          We have to stop this.  There's only one chance to fill
with this technology niche.  You see, your voice is going to be
digitized at your telephone not down at the office, so there's
going to be a computer in your phone.  And once it's digitized it's
practically free to encrypt it.  It will be encrypted.  The
question is will it be encrypted with technology that we control or
technology the government controls.            If we build a technology infrastructure that some future
government might inherit, a future government that could be a bad
government -- you know, sometimes economies change.  Germany in the
1930's, Russia in the 1990's, we don't know where our economy will
be twenty years from now, thirty years from now.  A government
could emerge with fascist tendencies.  If they inherit a technology
infrastructure that allows them to monitor every movement of their
political opposition, every transaction, every conversation and
every communication, every bit of travel, then they'll be able to
hold onto power.  It could very well be the last government we ever
elect.  I think if you're trying to analyze technology policy you
should ask yourselves what kinds of technologies would strengthen
the hand of a police state, and then don't deploy those technolo-
gies.  This is a matter of good civic hygiene.
          So that's about all I have to say.  I guess we can have
our question and answer period.

@_subject: Censorship In Cyberspace 6/6 
MODERATOR:  I think first I'm going to give the membeQ
of the panel the opportunity to ask any questions that they want of
each other.  Does anybody have a question for another panelist? Okay.  Well, then, the floor is open for questions.  Yes.
          Q:   Miss Lafontaine, your student editor, Kristin, why
didn't she tell the teacher in Palestine to (inaudible)?  I mean
the children were the ones that submitted the material.  Their free
expressions had already gone out.  What did she care what they
          LAFONTAINE:  Because it took her about a year to be able
to get a contact in the Palestinian schools.  See, that's one thing
that we don't understand.  In a school to get even a modem in and
then to get a network and to get $100 maybe a year to do this is
miraculous, and then to find the contacts for partner schools is
even more miraculous.  And this school has been working on this for
five years.
          Q:   Didn't they cut their nose off to spite their face? Cut themselves off from (inaudible)?
          LAFONTAINE:  Yeah, I think that this particular person,
the teacher in the Palestinian occupied territories, would have
said, "That's it.  We're not communicating anymore."  And, you
know, it was really her vision to get some communication.
          MODERATOR:  Yes.
          Q:   Mr. Corn-Revere, with respect to the problems that
Mr. Zimmermann was raising just now with respect to the Clipper
Chip, I wonder if there isn't some way to find this legislation
unconstitutional, as burdening the rights to interstate commerce or
the right to travel?
          CORN-REVERE:  Not really, because it's an extension of a
legal structure that's existed for some time.  It's quite right in
talking about the problem of wiretapping being one as old as tele-
phones, and the Supreme Court really first addressed it in 1928 and
at the time the only Justice who really understood what was going
on was Louis Brandeis, who basically said it's not going to stop
with wiretapping.  Some day the government may develop even more
advanced technological means of rifling through drawers, obtaining
access to peoples' papers without having to go inside their homes,
which is exactly what we're talking about.            But in terms of the Constitutionality, at the time the
Court said that wiretapping isn't a search in violation of the
Fourth Amendment because there's no physical intrusion.  They
reversed themselves in 1967, but as with all or most Constitutional
rights, or particularly Fourth Amendment rights, because it says
you can't do an unreasonable search without getting a warrant, you
really just need a legal structure that defines when you need to
get a warrant.  The latest Wiretap Bill extends that into newer
technologies, but again it does require the cooperation of the
phone companies.  It requires them to be wiretap ready.  The condi-
tions for getting a warrant, which is what the Constitution speaks
to, are the same.
          Q:   But what I'm wondering is if requiring that techno-
logy, that the actual product be structured in a certain way or
include a certain feature, I wonder if that wouldn't even infringe
individuals' right to contract, to have a certain kind of, to not
be able to buy a certain kind of product.  I don't want this
product in my phone.  It seems like the government is entering into
some kind of monopoly with the phone company.  So I'm wondering if
it's possible --
          CORN-REVERE:  They've been doing that for some time.
          Q:   -- to come at this from something other than just a
Fourth Amendment and First Amendment perspective.
          CORN-REVERE:  Yeah.  I understand the point.  I don't
know that there's a Constitutional right to buy a particular kind
of product.  But a good first step would be for people to under-
stand exactly what's going on with this legislation.  I think, you
know, what Phil Zimmermann was talking about is the best first
step, for people to really understand the implications of this,
because I think they're truly frightening.
          Q:   I agree with the distaste for the Information
Superhighway metaphor.  I was wondering if any of you had ideas
about a better metaphor, because --
          VAN DER LEUN:  I'd like to just kill all these metaphors
now.  The whole medium is in the throes of these metaphors, and
then people take them generally in a much more concrete way and we
have just endless tedious discussions talking about what the
metaphors mean, what they don't mean.            I was thinking about this this morning.  There's a
problem -- occasionally The Well, my own system, has these global
problems that all the users get involved in, and one is currently
going on, and I'm just watching everybody stumble over all the
metaphors that we've sort of pulled up over the years to discuss
what we do there, and I felt myself yearning for people just to
sweep these metaphors away and just actually look at the actual
medium, which is sort of characters on a blue screen, almost down
on that level, to try and become fresh again.  I know, as you say,
the dissatisfaction, especially for the Information Superhighway,
is basically because this is the year in which every mind open to
the media is going to be paved over by this concept.  And it's just
tedious.  It's like blather and spew.            CORN-REVERE:  But I'm not talking about just words in a
literary vein.  Lawyers deal in concepts, usually not very well,
but also in terms of very broad concepts, in broad generalities,
and metaphors are important in abstract reasoning process.  And so
when you're describing what is possible under the law the metaphors
you use are very important, which is what happened in broadcasting.
          VAN DER LEUN:  Legal fictions.
          CORN-REVERE:  Yeah, legal fictions.  They deal with legal
fictions all the time and give them definitions, and to the extent
that it gets pigeonholed, whatever "it" is, by these legal
constructs and descriptions and metaphors that it limits what's
possible legally to do then.  Now I agree that ultimately tech-
nology wins.  But government can slow it down.
          Q:  The problem is that that metaphor has inhabited the
space of the discussion, so that, you know, Al Gore or whoever, you
know, appeals to it and it catches in peoples' minds until you
displace it with another and better metaphor, which would be a very
creative thing to describe.  I was wondering if in the history of
this kind of technology whether you could look at how other meta-
phors have been used to describe printing or film --
          VAN DER LEUN:  I think it's very difficult right now
because at the same time we have this metaphor about the
Information Superhighway that is displayed around and everyone's
tired of you have to realize that that arises out of a sort of
shared mental substrate that we're all consciously or not in right
now, which has to do with the tendency to describe everything
that's going on in the world in sort of terms of the computer, much
in the way that the universe used to be discussed as a large clock. Now the universe is a large sort of computer with lots of disks,
and God has RAM as big as all outdoors.  So that metaphor exists
within this sort of larger substrate.  This is how -- it's the
dominant -- the computer itself is immensely sort of loaded with
metaphoric possibilities and possibilities for analogy, so I don't
see this being done away with any time soon because something else
will just --
          Q:   The thought just occurs to me hearing you speak,
something like Minsky's notion of society.  It would be much harder
for people to agree with the Al Gore (Inaudible; overlap)
          MODERATOR:  This is now becoming sort of a very interest-
ing conversation,ut perhaps a conversation that might be carried
on at the wine and cheese party.  Did you have a question?
          Q:   Yes.  I saw a conflict emerging between the optimism
of Mr. Van Der Leun's the technology is going to beat efforts to
suppress and Mr. Zimmermann's conversations about all the ways that
the government can suppress it by using technology to encrypt, to,
as you say, to put in our computers what's the equivalent of the
voltage system.  I was wondering if somehow you could discuss it or
resolve it or expand on this.  Between the two of you, which --
          ZIMMERMANN:  I'd like to say something about that.  I run
into people all the time who say that the war is over.  It's just
a matter of mopping up now.  I don't think it is.  The government
can pass laws against things and put people in jail, and Louis
Fried's comments indicate that if he tries to press for legislative
relief they could pass it, like they passed the FBI Wiretapping. What happened there, I mean a friend of mine who was active in the
Nuclear Freeze said, "You know, you guys are totally unorganized. How could you possibly let something as big as the FBI Wiretap Bill
just said right on past?  Where were all the letters to the
Congressmen?  Where were all the phone calls?  Congress didn't hear
a peep out of anybody about this.  How did this happen?"            If we're asleep at the switch while we all talk to each
other in our little tiny private news groups, you know, with our
little inbred little circles of friends, we're not going to affect
Congressional policy, Congressional laws, legislative activity. What happens the next time when they pass a law outlawing other
kinds of cryptography except for escrowed (ph) encryption systems? That could happen.  The ship of state has a very large turning
radius.  We're going to have to start trying to turn this super-
tanker right now.  It may take years before they pass legislation
outlawing other kinds of cryptography.  I don't know.  Certainly
it's going to be at least a year, but it could be five years.  But
we have to start now.  We have to really start pressing and not
just talk amongst ourselves in InterNet news groups.
          VAN DER LEUN:  Of course I was around with the EFF for a
lot of this thing, but I certainly disagree with the need for
constantly being citizen active.  Where was everyone?  Well, like
I said, I think the EFF became sort of a luncheon lobby.  It
basically lost the grassroots support when it made certain policy
turns a while back.  I mean I was sort of shocked to hear -- did
Barlow really tell you that he could have changed the vote of a
Senator but he didn't because that law was best they could get?  I
mean that can't --
          ZIMMERMANN:  No, he didn't tell me that.  Steve Levy told
me that.  I think he read it on the Net, so --
          VAN DER LEUN:  If that's true (Inaudible) -- you know, I
mean there was a -- not that EFF is particularly powerful about
this, but it was for a while until they started going in another
direction.  We certainly have to deal with this but I think, you
know, everybody talks from what I like to call the illusion of
central position and I think that obviously we're going to go
forward and do what we can to resist government moves on this point
but I don't think the rest of the Net is going to slow down.  I
mean without the Net would there be a Zimmermann?  Would there be
a Net in the future without a Zimmermann?  You know I think the two
are almost symbiotic, or probably will turn out to be in the
future.  Tools, not rules, and -- but that doesn't mean we quit
trying to shape the rules.  You know, I think the other thing is
it's just a big blip on most Americans' horizons.            CORN-REVERE:  That's the problem.
          VAN DER LEUN:  Well, but maybe that is not something
we're going to do by just waving our modem and saying it's
          CORN-REVERE:  True, but that's what you have groups like
EFF for ideally.  Unfortunately, being based in Washington you tend
to get absorbed into the atmosphere, the environment of Washington. If you want to be a player you go for the best you can get, which
is what happens to lobbying groups all the time.  They figure if
they want anyone to listen to them they'll make the compromises
that they need to make.            The problem is politically that on the Hill who's going
to say no to the FBI?  People don't vote against FBI-backed
measures.  It's not just in the days of J. Edgar Hoover.  It
continues today.  It was true in the '80's when they rewrote the
Wiretapping Law for the first time then to include digital
communication.  It started out as a fairly decent bill, and then
the Justice Department and the FBI got hold of it and riddled it
with exceptions.  So now it's up again, and the next bill will be
the encryption bill.  And it's not that every citizen everywhere
has to constantly be marching in picket lines saying this is the
most important issue in the world.  It's just that when you have a
group that's supposed to pay attention to these things I think it
helps if they take a principled position and at least makes these
issues known to the extent that they can.  But if their mission is
to have lunch with lobbyists and get the best deal that they can,
then there's nobody watching the store.
          ZIMMERMANN:  The Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington, EPIC, is a real, committed, true blue, principled
organization dedicated to trying to hold the line on these issues. They used to be Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility,
but they had a Washington office which specialized in electronic
privacy and so they created this special group out there.  If you
want to support somebody who's really consistent on this, they're
a good one to support.
          Q:   The Electronic Privacy Information Center?
          ZIMMERMANN:  Yes.
          VAN DER LEUN:  They're much more principled about it than
EFF.  They're always quick.  They're always on a very strong and
positive side of the issues.  The tragedy is they're not as well
funded as the EFF group.
          MODERATOR:  I would like to suggest that not everybody
who really feels principally concerned about this issue is on-line,
and it's possible that if an effort was made to get in touch with
people like Feminists for Free Expression or the Civil Liberties
Union or something like that rather than relying on on-line
communication -- I didn't even know that the Bill was up until I
was at a meeting and somebody said, "The Senate is voting at seven
o'clock, right now.  And the House has passed it."  And it wasn't
in the paper.  I think that a lot of people who would have
protested it just didn't know.
          VAN DER LEUN:  I'm in the Net all the time and I didn't
know.  I didn't see it on the Net.  I don't snoop around in those
          Q:   On that same note people who haven't even been on
the InterNet or any sort of electronic medium are affected.  There
are instances that I've heard of, that I've read about, where the
federal and state governments are avoiding FOIA, Freedom of
Information Act requirements, and Sunshine Laws by holding elec-
tronic conferences.  I was wondering if Congress has addressed that
at all, if anyone can answer that question.
          [Inaudible - no response]
          MODERATOR:  The gentleman in the back?
          Q:   The problem with the philosophy (inaudible) to the
UseNet is that what it fails to do is it fails to teach us how to
form a consensus and how to form a coalition.  While the Net has
all these great individuals that might lead the fight, it doesn't
do a very good job on building networks, and that's really a
problem.  The problem is that we've lost sight that the idea of
free speech is not merely that you can be a talking head but that
speech is a tool for persuasion.  If we don't address this problem
of consensus, organizations like the FBI don't even care about
consensus will always (inaudible).
          ZIMMERMANN:  Yeah.  You become marginalized, where you
only talk to people that believe the same thing that you do.  In
fact these news groups are especially designed for that.  The
technology of the news groups is especially designed to isolate
people from each other.  People with the same interests are drawn
together in the news groups, but they're isolated movements in
          MODERATOR:  Yes?  Oh, I'm being signalled from the back
and I believe that I'm being signalled because it is time for our
discussion to end.  Is that the case?  Yes.  The lady with laryn-
gitis is nodding her head.  One minute.  One more question.  Yes.
          Q:   I just wanted to ask, at the risk of sounding naive
I'm very alarmed by some of the things here that Mr. Zimmermann has
said and I'd like to know if you have any suggestions of what we
can.  Why didn't we know about this?  I didn't know that they can
now put something in our phones that allows them to easily wiretap. How do we get this out to the public?  Do any of you have any
suggestions about this?  I mean I don't want to leave here feeling
          VAN DER LEUN:  It hasn't been an under reported item.  I
mean I don't want to give anyone the impression this is like some
secret document or technology handed out in a back room.  It has
been noted in the Wall Street Journal, in the New York Times, on
          ZIMMERMANN:  Yeah, but what can you do is the question. I think that you should write letters to the editor, talk to your
Congressman, especially your Congressman, and to your Senator of
course, too.  You know, I've been so focussed on my specialty that
I thought everyone else was going to try to cover the Wiretap Bill. It's all I can do to juggle with all the set of chainsaws that I've
got in my hands right now.  My arms are getting tired.  So I just
assumed that somebody else would handle the FBI Wiretap Bill, and
in fact a lot of us have come to rely on the EFF to handle these
things.  So getting the watchdog to take a nap certainly was a
highly effective means of getting that one to sail right on
          CORN-REVERE:  You mentioned your specialty.  And we all
come from different specialties.  I mean my background isn't
computers.  I've recently started getting into some on-line
services, but that isn't my background.  I started as a communi-
cations lawyer doing broadcast law and cable television law and
things like that.  My main interest is in making sure that tech-
nology doesn't determine what the legal structure is and it doesn't
determine what your Constitutional rights are, and so I'm moving
naturally towards these areas.  There is more than just a conver-
gence of technology going on and a convergence of media.  There's
a convergence of specialties.  It takes people from our respective
disciplines getting together to try and get at these issues.
          ZIMMERMANN:  You know I think we're in need of a real
political movement to get started on privacy.  You know, we've got
these very small lobbying organizations and 501(C)(3) educational
organizations like EPIC, the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
and I think EPIC does a good job for what they do.  But what we
need is, drawing back to the experience of the Nuclear Freeze era
it's going to be hard to get that kind of groundswell.  You're not
going to get a million people marching in Central Park for elec-
tronic privacy.  But you can get a big grassroots thing going if
you really work at it.  You know, in the early days of the Nuclear
Freeze you'd have meetings that were very sparsely populated like
this one.  But as a few years went by and Reagan was rattling the
saber and talking Evil Empire and (inaudible) with enough shovels
and things like that the churches began to fill up.
          MODERATOR:  Well, that's a good note for us to offer,
since we are sparsely populated, a glass of wine.  Come and join us
for some wine and cheese.
