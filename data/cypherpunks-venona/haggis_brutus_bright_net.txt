@_subject: Taking crypto out of the U.S. 
Soon I am going to be going overseas to Japan, and I want to take
my notebook with me so I can keep up with everything, however, I have
encrypted my hard drive and usually encrypt my mail.  Is this in violation
of the ITAR to keep everything the same when I go over?
