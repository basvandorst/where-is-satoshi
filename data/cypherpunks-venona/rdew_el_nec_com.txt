Soooo, maybe you want we should send it elsewhere, to the same lists you
send to, you should publish the correction, not just flame ...
Until then, we just have to do as told by the list-admin ...

NO, NO.  PGP licensing agreements are by the server, not by the client.  You

BTW, arrange your contracts in two chuncks.  The small one has the high priced service agreement, and the large one has the licenses for the user

That one is easy.  NSA does not get all the recovery key info from stuff
developed in Australia.

Doesn't the act of taking it across the border, in the laptop, constitute
an act of export??

I guess I was thinking about the NSA, recording the message and deciding to make an example.  They seem to do that occassionally just to keep the rest
of us folks 'in line'.  I can't see the INS even understanding what they were looking at, even if you showed them.  "My, my, my!  All those bits are
really in that little box?"  You have to understand the difference between
a 'large possibility' and a 'fat chance', yes?
Now, drugs!  That they understand ...  But a PKI key?  Or, a file??  Or, a
crypto program (especially renamed)???  What piece of this trick question am I missing?

Yes, it is.  Even if he wrote a program in Mexico, but carried his laptop
back and forth daily, each piece can come into the US, but cannot leave
again!  Uuuuuuuuummmmmmm, gooooood!  Read the actual documents.

I cannot remember all of the equations that go into this, and only a very
simplistic approach follows, but ...
If your surge protector is a semi-conductor, it probably will be self-limiting.  That is, it will reach a maximum block, and pass
whatever is above that.  A Trans-sorb device, and those chemical ones, all limit what they do based upon a total absorption.  A lot of little
ones kills it the same as a single big one.  None of these tell you they are no longer operable.
However, if the UPS is properly built, it will have an inductor as the
leading serial device in a set of 'things'.  I would expect a set of
capacitors, in parallel with my load, on either side, appropriately sized.  The battery that makes the 'U' in the UPS acts like another
capacitor.  These act as fast as the spike, ALWAYS.  The sizes and number
of components requires some calculations (testing does NOT hurt, either).
Stan needs to review his basic electronics.  Yes, it will even protect
against lighting if designed for that purpose.  Costs vary accordingly ...

Clearly you only considered a few of the semi-cons.  Others just stop
working, while still others pass anything above the manufacturer design
max.  Your lack of desire to learn indicates a possible reason why you don't seem to understand ...
At my age, I forget some ...  What is that old adage about leading a horse to water, but you can't make him read?  or something like that!
