@_subject: How long would it take? 
Could the NSA reverse PGP encryption on a message that was iencrypted with

why not? How long would it take? What do you know that corroborates this?
This is a genereic question, which I hope aeveryone who knows about  this
will attempt to answer. If this is not the right subject for the LIST, send
replies via EMAIL to
