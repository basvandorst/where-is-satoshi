@_subject: Request: tamper-proofing executables 
I would appreciate any pointers to documents, source code or
programs that deal with using cryptographic techniques to detect
or prevent modification of executable code. I am looking for something that uses either a signature or a one-way hash to detect
modifications at run time.    Of particular interest is information on signing a file that
includes the signature as part of the file. Is this possible with
any of the common algorithms?
                                       Thanks! Dan

@_subject: Re: jpunix.com and MX'ing 
This still won't quite do it. Clever mailers on the other end of
the connection (sendmail included) will do a name lookup based on
the IP address.  This will (usually) return the systems canonical
name, and sendmail will make sure to stick that in the header. In fact, if identd is running on the sending system, it will even stick
in the userid of the sender. The fix involves changing the in-addr.arpa domain tables for that ip
address to make it report another name.  This will take complicity on
the part of whoever manages those tables, and will complicate things
when dealing with hosts on the remailers local network. A good way to
work around this would be to slap another ethernet card in the machine
so it has two addresses, one configured normally for that network and
the other setup to be on remailer.net (or whatever.)
Since this includes the cooperation of a local network administrator
anyway, it makes most of the MX tricks a little less useful.

... and so on ...
Alice,    Could you please flag your messages with "[POINTLESS WORDY OFF-TOPIC FLAME]"
in the subject line from now on? Since you are going through a
remailer, I can't otherwise killfile you.    Alternatively, there seems to be growing support for the "[NOISE]"
standard, you could at least do us all the service of including that.    Many thanks.

There are more details about Livingston's Exon Box (they call it
ChoiceNet) available at
 .
My kneejerk reaction was to hate this thing too, but now I'm not so
sure. If I was responsible for the Internet connectivity for a K-12
school system, I would want this capability in a big way. I see the Livingston product as an enabling technology. The obvious
associated risk is Big Brother deciding, "If one router CAN do it, then
every router MUST do it!" The idea of having a Naughty_Enabled Bit in
IPv6 is, of course, even worse; but I'm glad it isn't my job to
exlpain why it is horrid to a Federal judge. [ SNIP ]
