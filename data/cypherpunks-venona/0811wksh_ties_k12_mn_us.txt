@_subject: Caller ID 
I believe the frequencies used for Caller ID are per Bell 202, a straight
FSK data standard.  I have a copy around here somewhere & will post the
appropriate numbers unless someone tells me it's NOT 202 before I find the
spec ..... ... ..

@_subject: "Philosophical" politics in technical groups 
It seems to me the reason some "techies" insist on posting soft political
discourse in thecnical groups is that no one will listen to them in the
groups designed for soft politics, or flames them when they bring up "nuts
& bolts" issues.
Maybe we need a new news thread for people who want to argue soft politics
only with technically oriented people so they don't have to put up with
all those other people who disagree with them for no reason.

@_subject: Cost of Internet (was: Should we oppose ... Superhighway) 
Please don't confuse New York with the vast reaches of Rural America.  ALL
Internet access is a long distance call from many many location in the
world, including here.
I would *love to have a free national net available, 'cause I think I know
how to use it.  Others might abuse it, but I woul work the heck out of it.

In New York City, the effective variable cost of an internet mail/news
connection is $27 a month -- less than you can panhandle in about
threen hours during rush hour, and I'm assuming you never use the
phone for anything else and call a couple times a day. The cost is
still dropping, and will doubtless be nearly invisible even without
any government intervention within a few years. My poorest unemployed
friend living in Hell's Kitchen in a fifth floor walkup apartment in
roach-infested tenement (no joke) has an internet connection via
I therefore see no reason for government guarantees of net access --
it is obvious that anyone with even minimal initiative can get one
already, or will be able to within a few years. The cost of a net
connection is far less than the cost of, say, smoking, and there are
homeless people who still manage to smoke.
