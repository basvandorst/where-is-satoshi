[intro deleted]
There was never a "one-time" fee.  You could register as many domains as
you wanted whenever you wanted (as long as you weren't violating a trademark or something like that).  Usually people with domains would run into charges because they needed someone else (usually an ISP) to run
authoritative nameservers for their domain.
Nothing stops anyone from running their own name server.  However, the root
servers are what 99% of the nameservers out there point at.  No one is going
to use dns.joe.schmoe.org as their primary nameserver.
And then there could be competition, which could potentially create some
bad scenarios.  What if one registration service refused to propagate their
domains to other registration services?
