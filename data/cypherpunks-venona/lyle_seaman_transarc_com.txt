@_subject: Re: Real-world digicash 
re NetCash:
Hmph.  You can say that again. There is no real anonymity in NetCash
(v1).  What they describe is something like an online (non-anonymous)
system with the suggestion that people may achieve anonymity by
trafficking in coins without verifying their validity.  If they
receive an invalid coin, T.S.  In such an environment, you can bet
that everyone would keep records of all off-line transactions so they
could recover their losses if they were passed an invalid (spent)
coin.  The suggestion that a (non-anonymous) Currency Server might
simply avoid tracking coins is poppycock.  That would work for epsilon
months, until the CS was strongarmed into keeping logs.
One valid point that the NetCash paper raised was that a framework
must be devised in which currency exchange can occur, without forcing
an intermediate transfer into paper. I like Nick's suggestions regarding mostly-offline digicash.
A couple of issues which it seems must be pointed out:
1.  Any digicash scheme is going to require some hardware.  You just
can't do this with pencil and paper.  They don't all require
special-purpose, tamperproof hardware, but very few people are going
to be willing to keep long lists of numbers and do complex arithmetic
in their head...
Hal sez:
The credit-card infrastructure is funded by the 3%-7% cut that the
credit company gets from each purchase.  Who is going to fund such an
infrastructure (potentially much much much larger) for cash
transactions?  Presumably, it would be someone who stands to make a
profit from these transactions, but how will that profit be realized?
Maybe the digicash vendor will charge for on-line verification.  I
guess that works.  It lets the dcash recipient decide whether to trade
off risks against known costs, which I like.
A widely-used digicash scheme will certainly include small computers
for performing the transactions.  Such a computer should be guarded as
well as one's wallet, or one's home safe.
Requiring more bandwidth isn't really a problem.  The available
bandwidth of any network is practically infinite, if you don't care
about delay. For all practical purposes, the off-line systems don't care
about delay.  (to forestall flames, I will admit that the delay
must be small enough to reduce the temptation to double-spend, and
that it must be small enough to prevent the holder of cash from losing
value due to inflation.  Delays on the order of days are not
unreasonable.  Given current technology (ie, without purchasing any
new hardware), the workstation on my desk can handle 10 times the
bandwidth that it now does, if I will accept delays on the order of several days.) I forgot what else I was going to say.  I think my 'nym is stealing my
thoughts. Lyle		Transarc		707 Grant Street

Ah, oops.  I was thinking of Halcyon, actually.  And there are other drugs,
like Versed and Fentanyl, which have similar effects to Sodium Pent or
severe inebriation, in that they cause loquacity and memory loss. The effect is that people talk about whatever "is on their mind",
which might or might not be true.  Someone might try very hard to
convince you of their innocence of a particular crime.  If they were,
in fact, guilty, their ability to lie convincingly under the influence
would be rather impaired.  However, their ability to speak clearly is
often pretty seriously impaired as well.

Since Aldrich Ames has been in the news recently, I think this is

CIA IS UP TO ITS EYEBALLS IN COCAINE DEALS
Which banks laundered the money?
By Deirdre Griswold
No element of the state apparatus is more shielded from public
scrutiny than the Central Intelligence Agency--the U.S. secret
police whose operations span the globe.
What do they really do? How much of the public treasury is
diverted into their coffers? How many of the vicious wars now
tearing apart poor countries were hatched in their inner
It seems that one thing they do is ship millions of dollars' worth
of cocaine into the United States.
That's according to an official of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Agency, Annabelle Grimm, who was interviewed by the program "60
Minutes." The New York Times of Nov. 20 first broke the story.
"I really take great exception to the fact that 1,000 kilos came
in, funded by U.S. taxpayer money," said Grimm. A thousand kilos
is over a ton of pure cocaine.
CIA, COCAINE AND DEATH SQUADS
The 1990 shipment was arranged by Mark McFarlin of the CIA and
Gen. Ram"n Guilln Davis of the Venezuelan National Guard, said
the Times story. What possible reason could the CIA give for
arranging to ship a ton of cocaine into the U.S., where it was
then sold on the streets? It was done to "gain the confidence" of
Colombian drug traffickers, explained the agency.
McFarlin's history includes a stint in El Salvador, where he
worked with "anti-guerrilla forces" in the early 1980s. This is a
euphemism for the government death squads that, together with the
Salvadoran army, were responsible for the deaths of 70,000 people
in the dirty war there. The guerrilla movement represented the
workers and peasants. The U.S.-funded killers did the bidding of
the landed oligarchy and the multinational corporations that have
sucked El Salvador dry.
What is the connection between drug trafficking and a rightwing
political police agency like the CIA? Plenty.
Recently, the CIA was implicated in covert support for the
right-wing military in Haiti, which has deposed the popularly
elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. At the same time, the
State Department was grabbing headlines with its loud but
ineffectual negotiations supposedly meant to return Aristide to
his country.
The Haitian military are known to be deeply involved in the
highly lucrative drug trade--a compelling reason why they refuse
to relinquish direct control over the government.
During the Vietnam war, the CIA used its fleet of secret planes
to ferry opium and heroin out of Southeast Asia--at the same time
that its agents were assassinating Vietnamese villagers in the
notorious Phoenix program. Drugs became a major social problem in
the U.S. at this time. (See "The Politics of Heroin in Southeast
Asia," Alfred W. McCoy, Harper & Row, 1972)
LINKS TO BANKS
The biggest question, however, is the tie between covert
government agencies like the CIA and the giant banks that launder
hundreds of millions of dollars in drug money.
It is public knowledge that the CIA deposits large amounts of
money in the name of dummy companies. At the highest levels, bank
officials obstruct public scrutiny of dubious transactions,
including those involving large amounts of cash. When they are
working with the CIA, all this can be passed off as necessary in
the interests of "national security."
In January 1985, Bank of America was fined $4.75 million in a
civil penalty for failing to report more than 17,000 large cash
transactions. Other huge banks paid lesser fines in this mild
crackdown on widespread money laundering. No criminal charges
were pursued.
In 1989, after Treasury officials estimated that as much as $110
billion was being laundered by U.S. banks each year, the Bush
administration announced it would regulate international money
transfers by U.S. banks, and would set up a large computer center
in Arlington, Va., to monitor information on money laundering.
And there it has sat. No big indictments, or even civil fines,
have been forthcoming against the big capitalist bankers.
Repression and police corruption
Instead, all the muscle has gone into sending U.S. paramilitary
units into impoverished South American nations like Bolivia and
Peru to interdict cocaine supplies--with no results--and
beefed-up SWAT teams into oppressed communities in the U.S.,
where their racism and brutality are notorious.
Repression against drug dealers on the street level is worse than
futile. As the recent Mollen Commission hearings in New York
showed, it is often linked to massive corruption among the police
This latest revelation about the CIA and cocaine shows once again
that drug trafficking can only be rooted out through a mass
struggle aimed at the vital institutions of capitalist society.
They are in it up to their eyeballs.

Well, I did something similiar about 3 years ago with a friend.  But we
just laid a wire down on the street one evening, spread roofing tar over

street has had many patches/repairs over the years, it's unlikely a
casual observer would notice.  (Those that did notice ours thought it
was pretty creative...)
But anyway, on the radio circuit: Building a radio transceiver isn't too
difficult...but connecting it to your computer could be.  Probably the
easiest thing to do is get a simple analog transciever, and use a
error-correcting modem.  Unfortunately that wouldn't be much better than
doing it over the phone anyway...  But let me know how you're project
