Forgive me if this point has already been raised, but couldn't an objection to such laws be based on the protection against self-incrimination? Maybe this all depends on whether the legal context is a civil or a criminal proceeding. If I'm being sued and they ask me at a deposition
whether I did such-and-such, I can't take the Fifth (or can I?). But if I'm accused of murder, the police can't make me tell them where I've buried the knife. However, if I have a wall safe and they get a warrant to search it, can I be jailed for contempt if I don't give them the combination? This seems to be a case where existing legal paradigms ought to extend rather naturally. Whether the existing paradigms are any good or not is of course a separate question. --Michael Smith

Yes, this was my understanding. I guess the point I was groping toward was that while  we could hardly expect that our rights vis-a-vis
electronic privacy would be any _better_ than our rights in obviously analogous non-electronic areas, they might well be worse;
it's important to be clear, and to make clear, that what rights we have left have obvious extensions to our net.activities, and try to prevent the thin end of the wedge from being inserted in our portion of the perimeter.
Of course, this only applies to the set of people who live in countries where people _have_ any rights, and as Phill implies, that may soon be the null set.   --Michael Smith

So presumably the same would apply to the password that unlocks my PGP private key. But there's an interesting twist. Once they open up the wall safe, they can see for sure what is and isn't in it. This ain't necessarily so for an encrypted file. Suppose my software has the fiendish sophistication to disgorge different keys depending on what password was given, and different pieces of cleartext depending on what key was used. (Again, I apologize if this notion has already been extensively discussed.) Is there a way to set it up such that the cops couldn't be sure -- even using a logic analyzer -- that I hadn't given them the complete set of keys, so as to read all the cleartexts in the file? Assume that cyphertext files are guaranteed to be larger, by some random factor, than the sum of all the cleartexts in them, so the mere fact that a smaller quantity of cleartext was disgorged than cyphertext supplied would tell them nothing. I guess this is a kind of steganography, isn't it? Or at least something similar -- the point would be that they couldn't tell genuine cyphertext from camouflaging noise, without the key that tells them where to look. Which brings us, in turn, to the bottom line: the only things we can be certain the bad guys _won't_ do, are the things they _can't_
do. --Michael Smith

I'm unclear about the patent status of elliptic curve systems. Are they covered by the Diffie-Hellman patent? That is, is the lnguage of this patent broad enough to cover _all_ public-key systems, regardless of their mathematical basis? --Michael Smith

What licensing requirements exist for people who might want to use this code in their products? In particular, does one need to obtain any licensing from RSA or Cylink? --Michael Smith
