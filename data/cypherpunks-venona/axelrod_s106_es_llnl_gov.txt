I gather that a court can order you to produce the means to decrypt cyphertext
that the court has ruled is evidence. This would imply that the giving of
the means to decrypt (which could simply be the uttering of a password) is
not considered testimony, because you cannot be forced to give testimony under
the 5th amendment. Is there a court decision on point for this issue. In another
but similar context, can a court order you to give it the combination of a
safe, that contains evidence? I suspect, if that is the case, then there is
no 5th amendment protection against being so ordered to produce the means
to decrypt messages, documents etc.

If the key itself had embedded testimony that was incriminating, then it is
possible one could invoke the 5th amendment to avoid disclosure of the key.
But, I suppose a court could do an end run around that by giving limited use immunity for the incriminating content of the key. Comments?

You do have me confused with Mike Godwin. I did write:
But the rest of your questions refer to Mike Godwin.
My guess is that one could be compelled to reveal the combination to a lock
because the combination is not testimony. I'm sure that govenment lawyers
would argue that a key is not testimony, just as a combination to a safe
is not testimony. Perhaps some research would turn up the answer to this
There is also the matter of discovery in civil actions. If one had financial
records in encrypted form, a court could order you disclose the key under the
threat of civil contempt. Civil contempt can be worse than criminal
contempt. The court can ruin you financially and keep you in jail until you
comply with the order.
