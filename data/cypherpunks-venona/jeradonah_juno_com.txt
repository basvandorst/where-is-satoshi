really this concept is virtually identical to fractal encryption, where a
message is chopped into its component parts (25 a's, 3 b's, 8 c's, and so
on) and also chopped into a configuration scheme.  this form of
encryption does fall under the definition of munitions by the u.s.

fractal encryption is a simple concept.  however, testing of various
methods proved that the key was the "pattern recognition" element. because this part is sent separately from the alphanumeric element, the
cipher itself is as secure as imaginable.  only if someone captures both
elements, is able to understand the combination, and break the pattern
recognition scheme, can the cipher be read...
similiar a non-linear methodology will always defeat traditional (linear)
cryptoanalysis.  but that is precisely the reason that the us government
opposes the development and export of this form of encryption scheme...
