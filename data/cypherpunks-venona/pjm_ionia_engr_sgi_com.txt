Article VI
Clause 3. The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the
          Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive
          and judicial Officers, both shall be bound by Oath or
          Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious
          Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office
          or public Trust under the United States. Does any mechanism exist for removing Oath-breakers from office?  Any
member of Congress who proposes or votes for (as distinguished from
"speech or debate") unconstitutional legislation has clearly violated
their Oath, and hence are no longer legitimate holders of the office.
     Would someone who refused to be "bound by Oath or Affirmation" be
allowed to take a seat in the Congress?  If not, why should an
Oath-breaker be allowed to?
     Yes, I know, they'll do whatever the hell they want.

     Actually, there was a story in the San Jose Mercury News a couple
of weeks ago regarding a product that does just that.  VCRs from at
least two manufacturers will contain a chip and/or firmware that
detects commercials and does not record them.
     My dim memories from a project I did for Sony a couple of years
ago are that commercials are separated by a fixed number of black
frames and some, at least, have tracking information encoded so that
advertisers can monitor how often they are played.  I'll try to dig up
more info.

     Your solution fails against your specified threat.  Children who
are more software-proficient than their parents will, in many cases,
be able to access their parents' accounts and modify the configuration
file (or simply use the account to access the blocked areas).
Ultimately, all such systems are "home-based" if any accounts used by
members of the household have or can be granted access to the naughty
bits (tip o' the hat to M. Python).
     While your proposal is obviously marketable, given the success of
Prodigy and the prospects for SurfWatch, it does not appear to be
inherently more secure than schemes that utilize subscriber software.

     Expect to see something in the San Jose Mercury News in the near
future.  I contacted them to pitch the story, hoping to point out as
clearly and frequently as possible that the cracking was possible only
because of ITAR restrictions on key length.  They already have someone
working on it.

     I get something similar:

 +++ Command failed -- brutessl missing ?
Scalar found where operator expected at (eval 12) line 3, near "*($p"
        (Missing operator before $p?)

     Since you're sure to get a number of long responses to this
question, I'll keep mine short.
     I don't want to give anyone my keys.  I do not harm anyone by
refusing to do so.  Therefore, anyone using force to take my keys is
acting immorally.*

     No.  I don't choose to give Louis Freeh my keys.  I don't choose
to give Brian Davis my keys.  I don't choose to give Tim May my keys.
Any use of force to compel me to yield my keys is unacceptable.

@_subject: Usenet: pseudonymity's killer app 
Risks Digest 17.42 contains a Boston Globe story by Simson
L. Garfinkel detailing the risks of the DejaNews (
Usenet archiving service.  Not only does this service archive Usenet
postings, it provides a "sophisticated system for retrieving 'author
profiles' of the individuals who have posted messages."  Many people
are upset at what they view as an invasion of privacy.
     The article notes that:

     DejaNews will be archiving the alt, talk, and soc groups
beginning later this year.  That could result in many more people
becoming upset at the service.
     It would appear that ISPs could make money from offering
anonymous or pseudonymous accounts to their customers who would rather
not have their postings used by marketers, employers, or neighbors.
Providing protection from junk mailers is also more politically
defensible in this society than providing protection from the
     This could be the catalyst for widely used and accepted
pseudonymity on the net.
