Although prearrangement is needed, otherwise he would not be scanning this pile of random graphics for secret messages, he does not know whether he will receive a message or not, and no one else can know if he has received a message or not.

@_subject: Re: Euro Comm Adopts Privacy Directive (NewsClip) 
This is an even greater threat to privacy and rights than it appears.  In addition to the fact that enforcing such a law in a world where everyone has computers would require massive government intrusion, one must also consider the objective, the intent of such a law.   The intent of course is to limit what
we are permitted to know of each other.
In a world where contracts are largely enforced by reputations, (for example your visa card), governments can suppress freedom of contract by suppressing what information is available.  For example bankruptcy laws that violate freedom of contract are in part enforced by controlling what information credit bureaus are permitted to keep.  Indeed such restrictions are the major goal
of existing restraints on credit bureaus.
So not only does this law require extensive violation of freedom and privacy, the intent is also violation of peoples rights.
Both ends and the necessary means are, as usual, similar.
In the long run I do not think such laws can be effective unless governments use the same means to suppress privately computer mediated communication as the Chinese Empire used to suppress private paper mediated communication.  (The Chinese not only made paper a state monopoly, but they also castrated anyone with knowledge of paper making so that the knowledge would not be passed from father to son.)
This very vigorous enforcement did not hold back the tide for ever, but it held it back for a long time.

@_subject: Shared secrets and corporations in Cyberspace. 
How can collective entities hold keys?
Corporations derive their cohesion partly from realspace coercion, and
partly by trust based on face to face interactions among the participants,
and partly from their brand name.  Trusts derive their cohesion primarily
from trust, again based on face to face interaction.
A cyberspace corporation would derive its cohesion primarily from its name
identification and the public key associated with its brand name.  Consumers
would presumably wish there financial instruments to be signed to the public
key of Megacorp life insurance, rather than Megacorp's insurance saleman,
for fear that otherwise their funds might go astray, or they might get bad
software, etc, and the private key corresponding to that public key will
sign the employees paycheques.
If a cyberspace corporation does not have a valued brand name it is likely
to disintegrate into its components, in the way that some realspace
corporations did in the boisterous early days of silicon valley.
But this creates a problem of "owning the corporation". If one man knows the
corporations secret key, he can pretty much tell the shareholders to go take
a hike.  If two men know the secret key, it probably will not remain secret
much longer.
One solution is to use truenames, rather than keys as the "real identity" --
set up financial transaction software so that it considers that any key
signed by a proper authority certifying the key to be the key of Megacorp is
a valid Megacorp key, that all such keys are equivalent, and that the
authority will only issue keys to one entity called Megacorp.  Then when
folk start fighting over who is the real Megacorp, the authority resolves
the dispute by conventional means.
Current proposals for transaction software are based on truenames and
trees-of-trust.  This is not too bad as long as we have a forest, not a
single tree, but still, one would like to have some arrangement whereby a
large number of people could share a single key, and can buy and sell
interests in that key, whereby we can have the mechanisms of shared
ownership without the need for an external authority to enforce it.
Obviously trusts will work fine in Cyberspace, but trusts are by their
nature small and undemocratic.

During the entire period that Moore's law has been in effect, we have used

Now, with phase shifting masks in billion dollar fabs, we are reaching the
absolute limits of light.  If we go up to higher frequencies, we lose
refraction, and phase shifting fails.  Refractable light craps out at about
.3 to .15 microns.  Intel is currently at .35 microns.
There will be a slight hiccup or a major hesitation in Moore's law as the
fabs switch to a non optical printing process.
Current contenders are:
* Synchrotron radiation  (twenty billion dollar fabs, or worse.)
* ions  (fab price jumps a few times higher than current fab price.)
* electrons (no great escalation in fab price, but a radical drop in
production rates)
* flexible direct contact.  (fab price goes way down, back to producing ICs
in your garage.)
The flexible direct contact method has enough horsepower to take us all the

Whenever the user has used this buffer during a session, then when he quits netscape, save the buffer after first hashing To hash the buffer without loss of entropy, take the hash of one block of the buffer, and XOR it onto the next block (not the block that you hashed.)

Assuming that MD5 loses no entropy, it is identical, or very similar in
strength, since in the algorithm that I described the most recently altered
part of the buffer depends sensitively on all previous noise accumulated
into the buffer, so if the total cumulated entropy is larger than your block
size, you are OK.
However the algorithm I described simply used less computation, but the
overhead of continually doing MD5 is probably modest. No matter what you do, if you cumulate a hundred bits of entropy, and if you
use a one way hash to generate random numbers so that your session keys do
not leak information about your entropy, you are going to be safe against a

This is old term of the art, a term of information theory:  We use the same word because entropy in information theory has the same measure as entropy in thermodynamics.

Naturally everyone likes their job to meaningful, everyone likes their job to have an impact.  Everyone wants to be important.

Our function lust, if fullfilled, would give us more power over computers. Their function lust, if fullfilled, would give them more power over us.
Despite grandstanding by the republicans, no government agency has ever
been closed down, or suffered layoffs, merely because its function became completely obsolete.  (Though some have suffered renamings and reshuffles, and some have been allowed to shrink through natural attrition)

to me much better:  When you access the home page of the Playboy dirty pictures web site, you automatically buy a bunch of seemingly random numbers from them:  Every time you click on a URL, you spend one or more of their numbers.  If you have some left over when you are through, you can keep them or cash them.
This would mean two expensive transactions (high calculation and communication costs) per provider, instead of one expensive transaction
per click.
It also means that providers could make their tokens as cheap or expenisive

@_subject: Re: towards a theory of reputation 
Under current circumstances, where we have a large oversupply of
free government supplied retributive violence, the most important
from of reputation is "credit rating", which indicates willingness
to pay ones legitimate debts and perform contracts.
Willingness to fulfill ones obligations is not at all the same thing as
willingness to act in a way that improves other peoples utility.
Fulfilling an obligation assumes normative criteria.  Any
attempt to describe credit worthiness in terms of its effect
on the utility of creditors misses the point.  Before the nineteenth century, when most governments were reluctant
to provide adequate retributive violence, and were more concerned
with collecting taxes than upholding law and order, the most important form of reputation was the reputation for being a "gentleman" which encompassed both willingness to pay ones just debts and "gentle" conduct, gentle conduct meaning that you were unlikely to kill or harm people without good reason,
but did not require that you went around performing good works.
Now if someone has a reputation for good workmanship, this might
seem non normative, but such a reputation is a mixture of two components:  "X has good quality products" which is not normative
and is a fact rather than a reputation, because it does not involve a prediction of future behavior" and "X will fulfill the spirit and intention of a contract" which is a reputation, and is normative.
For example although in principle X might have simultaneously have
reputation for good workmanship and a reputation for not paying his debts and not delivering on contracts, such a combination would seem unusual and surprising.

I suggest a few requirements:
Store the keys, and information about the keys in a *real* database
(for windows apps, we can redistribute the Microsoft access and or
the paradox database engines royalty free, and drive them through ODBC to minimize dependency on specific vendors.)
Support tree of authentification:  A key that is *named* Peter by Sam,  or *named* Informix Corporation by the Delaware corporate registrar, shall
be considered equivalent to any other key given the same name by same
authority, whether that authority be Dark Unicorn, or the state of
This last property is essential if PGP keys are to be used as a
basis for exchanging promises to pay and directives to pay.
A very common use of this feature, pending the development of
user friendly software that makes every man is own bank and his
own credit rating agency, would be as follows:  Sam generates a long
key on a clean off line computer:  He uses it to name itself Sam and to
name several shorter keys "Sam".  He then puts the private long key on a floppy disk and buries it in a hole in the ground along with his gold and his stash of SKS ammo, and most likely never uses
it again.  He publishes the long public key, and uses
the shorter private keys for actual encryption.  From time to time, he changes keys, without any disruption or inconvenience.

This is excessively paranoid:  The main threat to freedom is still

The major expansion of WTO power came because of the notorious
corruption and one sidedness of American courts judging disputes
between foreign and American businessmen.
Since WTO courts do not have WTO gunmen this amounts to a major
separation of judicial and executive power, thus though it is
a centralizing move, it is also a move that favors liberty an
the rule of law.
Of course the first stages in centralization always do, at first,
favor liberty and the rule of law as they restrain corrupt and
lawless local powers.  Later, much later, the centralized power
becomes a greater threat to liberty than those local authorities
that it restrained.  That stage is still a long way down the track, and very likely the modern nation state will collapse first.

"Our" anti-GAK position.
I would like to hear Jim Clark say "GAK is bad".
I would also like to hear him, and you, refrain from using the phrase
"key escrow" and instead use the phrase "Government Access to Keys".
I draw your attention to the fact that Bill Gates did not use the intentionally misleading phrase "key escrow" in his book.

I will be greatly relieved when this happens.
I would be even more relieved if Netscape were to take action
to make it more difficult for the government to introduce GAK.
He did both less than that and considerably more than that:
Instead of trying to persuade us that he was against GAK, he sought
to persuade the reader that the reader should be against GAK.  He
sought to make it difficult for both a future Microsoft and a future
government to introduce GAK.
He described GAK in accurate language, rather than euphemistic terms.
He did not editorialize "GAK is bad" but any reasonable person reading his book, unfamiliar with crypto and the controversy, would conclude from the facts that he presented that GAK is a radical violation of the fourth amendment -- He described GAK in neutral, factually accurate language that doubtless deeply
offended the folks at NSA.
"Mandatory key escrow" is still an oxymoronic euphemism.
It is not escrow if the valuable item is held by someone who is party to the potential conflict, or subject to the power of someone who is party to the potential conflict.
Even to those of us who know what the euphemism "mandatory key
escrow" stands for, it still does not sound nearly as
threatening and scary as "government access to keys".

Jim Clark's  supposedly anti GAK statement was incomprehensible to me.
Perhaps he needs a punchier ghostwriter:
I offer my services free of charge.  :-)
If Jim Clark wishes to persuade us that his heart is in the right
place, he should put something like the following somewhere on the
Netscape web pages:
    "Our customers do not want government access to
     their cryptographic keys.  Mandatory government
     access to keys violates the rights of our
     customers.  Therefore we will not foist
     government access to keys on those customers
     who have freedom to communicate securely.
     We will only build government access to keys
     into our products for those customers whose
     governments force them to provide such access.
    "
If that really is Netscape's policy, then they should tell the world

I see no sign that NSA is capable of distinguishing between the interest of the state and the interest of the nation.
It is perfectly clear that the threat that NSA is primarily concerned with comes from within, not from without.
There is this big myth, spread partly by the US government, and partly by the radical left, notably Chomsky, that the US has been protecting the world against socialism:  This is a load of old bananas.  The US government has been pro socialist -- not as pro socialist as the IMF, and the IMF has not been as pro socialist as the Soviets -- but the US has still been shoving socialism down peoples throats in a heavy handed way, because they could get away with that kind of stuff abroad, when they cop hell for it at home.
The nastiest piece of socialism was arguably the land reform
scheme in El Salvador, which converted the peasants from
tenants of a few powerful rural landlords, to serfs on state
run collective farms.  This screwed up agriculture big time,
and the peasants detested it.
If you want to use land reform to make peasants into anti communists, you use the method so successfully used in Taiwan.  You make it possible for the peasant to buy land, and encourage him to buy land, and once he has some land of his own, and has sacrificed in order to obtain it, you can then trust him to resist communism.  If there are communist guerrillas around, you should give him a shotgun.
The US government followed a very different strategy in El Salvador, from which we may conclude that just as the South Vietnamese government considered that robbing
the Montagnards, and rendering them powerless and afraid was more important than resisting North Vietnamese communism, the US government similarly considered that suppressing private property, was more important than resisting communist infiltration in El Salvador.
El Salvador was vulnerable to communism because only two hundred
families owned everything worth owning.   If you want to prevent
communism the kind of land reform you need is land reform that
allows more people to acquire individual property rights.
I disagree.
Two government officials, one of whom is a communist, have more in common than two communists, one of whom is a government official.  The NSA is on the same side as the Chinese government,
and if Chinese dissidents used crypto with US GAK, this information
would be exchanged with the Chinese government.

@_subject: Censorship 
In the past, whenever a new medium came into play, the new medium was
subjected to extraordinarily restrictive censorship, while censorship was
radically relaxed, or abandoned altogether, on the old media.  Thus when the
talkies came in, censorship on books was relaxed.  When TV came in
censorship on movies was relaxed.  I conjecture that this represents the
power of vested interests, and the relative weakness of new interests.  Now
if this pattern is going to be repeated, we would expect the FTC to attempt
to utterly strangle the internet in a straightjacket, on behalf of the
television interests that have largely captured the FTC.
Note that current proposed legislation, legislation containing Exxon's
severe censorship rules, gives the FTC ownership of the internet.  They may
claim to own it.  Let us see them try.
Censorship on television is now much tighter than it used to be:  Expect a
radical relaxation when internet use starts to cut into television time.
Remember the original Star Treck:  Every episode would have a fistfight, a
gunfight, a space battle between starships with really cheap cheesy special
effects, Captain Kirk would dip his wick (off screen) in a new exotic alien
female, and he would defy orders, or Starfleet regulations, and most
regularly and spectacularly, he would violate the prime directive. In most
episodes a redcoat or two would be killed in a completely senseless and
unnecessary manner, illustrating the cold indifference of the universe, or
the casual evil of sentient beings.  Whenever they introduced a new
character with a red coat, you knew that violent death was on tonight's menu. Now consider the bland successor show "Star Treck the Next Generation":  In
a bow to political correctness they changed the words from "To boldly go
where no man has gone before" to "To boldly go where no one has gone
before". The "Next Generation" universe is socialist, and socialism is
boring.  Worse still, on "Next Generation" socialism actually works, and if
there is anything even more boring that actual real life socialism, it is
socialism that works because everyone cares about each other and they are
all such very nice people. Well it came to pass that our TV executives woke up to the fact that there
was something missing from the boring "Next Generation" universe, so they
shift their plots to less perfect places. In an upcoming science fiction series "Osiris" the story universe has social
collapse and reversion to barbarism, the exact opposite of the sickeningly
perfect "Next Generation" universe.  A logical continuation of the gimmick
they pulled in "Deep Space Nine" in order to get the story out from the
deadly grip of socialism.  So far so good.  But guess what? Nobody in the
"Osiris" story suffers violent death, and the bad guys reproduce asexually. Asexually!!  What would Captain Kirk do?
Probably sodomy.
And now let us consider the cartoons.  Remember Yosemite Sam with his fiery
temper and his two six guns?  Pow! Blam!
Well guess what?  In today's cartoons, Yosemite Sam has no guns!
Poor Captain Kirk.  Poor Yosemite Sam.
Under these circumstances we should expect a certain amount of friction
around such newsgroups as alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children,
alt.conspiracy, alt.sex.bestiality.barney, alt.nationalism.white, and so forth.
You will notice that political censorship goes hand in hand with censorship
of sex and violence:  Not only does Captain Whazisname of the "Next
Generation" and "Deep Space Nine" refrain from spreading his semen
indiscriminately across the galaxy and refrain from beating people up man on
man, he also obeys orders and regulations and never says anything that would
be controversial in his universe or ours.  They had to make Captain
Whazisname of "Deep Space Nine" black instead of the white Captain
Whazisname in "Next Generation" and young instead of old, because otherwise
nobody would have noticed that he was supposed to be different person,
played by a different actor.   Typical politically correct diversity:
Different colors, but only one voice.

be strong.   If something that simple had a flaw, the flaw would have
been found by now, whereas more complicated algorithms, such as DES,
might well avoid discovery of their flaws merely by their irregularity and

@_subject: Free speech and written rights. 
About twenty or thirty years ago, there was big debate on in Australia
on whether Australia should have a bill of rights.
The natural rights crowd popped up from obscurity and vigorously opposed
a bill of rights.  They successfully argued that if a bill of rights were written down on paper, these rights would then become mere creations of the courts.  This same concern is voiced in Article nine
of the American bill of rights.
In my judgement, America is reasonably free despite having a bill of rights,
rather than because of a bill of rights.
The American nation derived its cohesion from the ideology of liberty, not
from a race or religion.  This is the reason America has a bill of rights,
and this is the reason it remains somewhat free despite possessing a bill
of rights.
Despite this debate and referendum in Australia, the government has been sneaking some rights into the Australian constitution by various stratagems, and I think that this will have the effect of
undermining liberty.

Not so:  If the message is encrypted and checksummed with a simple
not non cryptographic checksum, this gives you everything a MAC gives you, plus the message is secret.
MACs are only useful in the strange and unsual case where you want
authentification using a symmetric key, but you want to transmit in
the clear.  I cannot see any reason why anyone would ever wish to use
a MAC except perhaps to obey government bans on encrypted messages.

A notable misfeature of the API is that it assumes that in general you will have two key pairs.  One for signing and one for encrypting.
Since in the most common case you are encrypting something related to a
signed message by the person you are encrypting to this is a
bad idea, and protocols that require two key pairs to avoid protocol
failure are hazardous and inconvenient.  I think Microsoft should not have chosen to support such protocols.
The Crypto engine that Microsoft will soon distribute in every copy of

I publish this trivial and obvious idea, because if I do not,
publish it, some clown will surely patent it.
(Has the patent on chewing gum and walking at the same time
been taken yet.  The more outrageous patents the patent office
issues, the more power and influence they get and the more funds

One of the great hazards with banking, and with financial services similar to banking, is that the financial institution has the opportunity to steal a great deal of money.
One solution to this problem is government auditors.  Government
inspectors, unlike private auditors, can force their way in, in
the early hours of the morning, and as each bank employee turns up,
take him to a separate cubicle and interogate him with a gun in
one hand and an account book in the other.  This makes it difficult
for the financial institution to fabricate a misleading picture of
its financial situation.
A hash tree can provide proof to a banks customers that the bank only
has the amount outstanding that it claims to have, without the need
for gunmen to check the totals.
At the close of month, the customer accounts are orgnized into a hash tree with the totals forming part of the hash
Each node is a hash of the two nodes below it, and the amounts of money in
the two nodes, and the sum of those two amounts.
Each customer can then see that the money the bank owes him is a part of
the total the bank claims to owe.  If a customer discovers he is not part of the hash tree, he knows the bank, or financial institution,
understates its indebtedness;
No auditors, government or otherwise, required.

I was concerned about a different issue:
Suppose you have some signed information:  You wish to send some encrypted
information to the person who wrote that signed information.
If the signing key and the encrypting key are the same, your software can
locally ensure that you encrypt with the right key, (The correct key is the
same public key that you used to check the signature on the message.)
If the signing key and the encrypting key are different, then in order to
ensure that you are not spoofed into using the wrong public key, the
whole protocol must work correctly, exposing many more points of attack, since key management is the most complex and most vulnerable area.

I refer to actual practice, not to theory:  (Though the guns are only metaphorically held to peoples heads, the examiners forcing their way in at dawn and ambushing the senior employees as they arrive are entirely literal.)
The objective is to take them by surprise and interrogate them
separately, to avoid them "hiding" some customers and some
If the element of surprise is lost, the examiners are likely to
be confronted with truckloads of plausible, consistent, and entirely bogus documentation, as happens regularly.
Of course a broker's opportunity to pull this kind of fraud is less
than a banks, because his customers will generally hold diverse
stocks.  Suppose the broker has embezzled some IBM stocks.  Then he will have to leave out some customers that own IBM stocks
from his record keeping.   But this will frequently result in
inconvenient excesses of other stocks and unexplained transactions
in other stocks, thus the needed book shuffling is more elaborate and inconvenient than that of a bank.
But it only requires one customer to discover the failure in
in a cryptographic tree, whereas to discover the failure in
the method of book keeping you describe, we have to be sure
we have covered all customers, and we have to be sure that
they receive the same information that the auditor does, and how
can one ensure that, except by the dawn raid method?
That is what software is for:  The task would of course have
to be done by financial software, not done by hand.
Set up the protocols so that software that verifies the hash tree
generates certificates that are proof that you are eligible to
receive the money, and software that does not, cannot generate
provably valid certificates.
Then if the institution comitts the fraud you describe, the ill
informed customers who use the rigged software get stiffed, as they cannot easily prove that they were owed, and the better informed customers do not get stiffed.
Notice that the above system requires that the banking software
be supplied independently and separately from the bank.
Customer expertise will improve dramatically after the first fraud,
much as computer security improves dramatically after the first

SCHOLARLY RESEARCH!!!!
You do not know shit from beans:  Alperovitz is no more a scholar than Zundel is:  He is a historical revisionist who lies even more crudely than the holocaust revisionists.
It is clear that in the opinion of the high command, the decision to surrender after they were nuked was a dramatic and radical change of position.  Alperovitz says otherwise, thus he is either grotesquely ignorant or, more likely simply dishonest.
         The use of the atomic bomb, most experts now believe, was totally
        unnecessary. Even people who support the decision for various         reasons acknowledge that almost certainly the Japanese would have
        surrendered before the initial invasion planned for November.         The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey stated that officially in 1946.         We found a top-secret War Department study that said when the         Russians came in, which was August 8, the war would have ended         anyway. The invasion of Honshu, the main island, was not         [And so on and so forth]
After the second nuclear attack, the Japanese high command had a
meeting with the emperor:  They heard testimony on the effects of
atomic bombs.  About half wanted to surrender, about half argued that
Japan should die gloriously:  They were unaware that the US had just
used up almost its entire nuclear arsenal.  They expected that surrender
would be followed by the same kind of reign of terror, rape, brutal
degradation, and mass murder, that they inflicted on the people that
they conquered. They expected that failure to surrender would result
in continued nuclear bombardment at about the same rate.  (Both
beliefs were incorrect.)
The Emperor *at that meeting* made the decision to surrender, shocking
a large part of the high command, and then made a speech on radio
announcing the surrender, stating as reason for the surrender that if
they did not surrender, Japan would be utterly destroyed by nuclear
Seeing as they were still debating the issue *after* two nuclear
weapons had landed on them, it seems reasonable to believe that
without atomic weapons, it would have been necessary to fight from
house to house from one end of Japan to the other.
When Hirohito ordered surrender in response to atomic bombing, the high command attempted to violently overthrow him, and when they failed, many
in the high command committed suicide.

After the first nuclear bomb was dropped, the Japanese government
held a cabinet meeting in which they summoned Nishina, head of the
atomic program, and asked him if he could duplicate atomic weapons
within a few months.
After two nuclear weapons had been dropped on Japan, the cabinet concluded
that Japan faced utter destruction with nuclear weapons, and some advocated
surrender.  But according to emperor Hirohito
   "At the time of the surrender, there was no prospect of agreement"
Even with two nuclear weapons, surrender was far from assured.  It was touch
and go:  Had the coup succeeded, Japan would not have surrendered, and a considerably more nuclear bombing would have been necessary.  The bullet
holes in the imperial palace testify that even after two nuclear bombs,
there was a substantial faction of the government determined not to surrender.
It was certainly true that Japan was defeated, and reasonable people may
disagree on justice of using nuclear weapons under these circumstances, but
to claim, as Alperovitz claims, that Japan was on the verge of surrender, is not a mere difference of opinion on the interpretation of the facts, but
a simple, crude, barefaced, blatant lie.

Terrorists are people who create terror by random murder, by killing the
innocent:  Clearly this is the exact opposite of what Jim Bell advocates.
The word terrorist was originally applied primarily to government organizations
of terror, most notably the french revolution.  You seem to be using the word
"terror" to mean  "Non government use of force"  So by your definition, George Washington was a terrorist, whereas the Stalin and the French Revolutionary tribunal were not terrorists.
By your definition of terrorist, there are plenty of advocates of "terrorism"
on this mailing list.
or possibly you need to comprehend the difference between governmental decrees
and morality.

First:  You will not get that, because governments invariably privilege large businesses above small businesses and individuals. and invariably privilege old established businesses against new businesses.
Secondly if you were able to get that, it would be even worse than the what you will actually get.
If you have one law for men who run businesses and one law other folks, then we have selective enforcement and application of the laws, that enables governments to act selectively and capriciously.   For example here in California private citizens who attempt to organize recall elections are often subject to extraordinary and confiscatory fines.

No pretence.  It is, and it has been for some time.
Your other arguments casually dismiss the very real power that large numbers of able people with good communications can exercise, have just exercised
very recently.
Nation states are a new creation.  In the past many different kings ruled many different bits of one nation, and one king often ruled parts of more than one nation.
Today nation states are almost universal, and people can no longer imagine what a nation is, other than a nation state.  But the net is a nation, and is not a state, and nationalism is a force that governments usually cannot withstand.
What makes a government strong is its cohesion, but the state cannot
create its own cohesion.  When states attempted to confront nationalism, they often lost cohesion and vanished altogether, like a string of sand. The "Nation state" is in essence a tactic for avoiding this hazard.
Governments are acutely aware of this problem, and act very cautiously in the face of such threats.  Many people seem to imagine that a government innately and naturally has cohesion, that it is naturally one thing, naturaly capable of acting coherently and cohesively as an individual can.  On the contrary, governments maintain their cohesion with difficulty, and continually act, or refrain from acting,
in fear that they might lose it.
In an all out knock down battle between a particular government and the
internet, in a state where a substantial proportion of the middle class
was on the internet, the government would be in serious danger of evaporating like a jellyfish in the sunshine.
The government can get away with a substantial amount of harassment and restraint, but has only limited power to act without itself being acted on, to change the world without itself suffering change.

You delete my arguments, and then say:  "I am not willing to take this on

During the American revolution, the British troops could go where they
pleased, and destroy whatever they wished, but they could not obtain
political control by so doing.
Yes, we are vulnerable, and so are they.  If they used the measures
proposed by Strata, the measures proposed by Jim Bell would gather wide support.
Ob Crypto:
They cannot obtain political control by mere acts of destruction, because they cannot be sufficiently selective in who they silence.
For destruction to be effective, you must not only harm those who oppose
you, you must refrain from harming those who do not oppose you.  The
destructive acts proposed by Strata conspicuously fail to do this.
Under the extreme conditions that Strata envisages, the measures proposed by Jim Bell would be effective in obtaining politically desired consequences,
because they are selective and targeted, and the measures that Strata fears
would be ineffective in obtaining the politically desired consequences, because they are unselective and untargeted.

The primary anti porn activists involved in the effort to regulate the net
were Donna Reed, and Marty Rimm, neither of whom are members of the Christian right, and Bill Arms, who is not only not a member of the Christian right,
but who in additon is a PC academic.
While their campaigns received assistance, encouragement, and free labor
from the Christian right, it was not the Christian right that enabled these
people to exercise the disproportionate power and influence that they did.
It was not the Christian right that obtained totally undeserved publicity for Rimm's spurious findings.
Rimm's study had connections both with the right and the left, but the real
question is where the big muscle came from.  If the big muscle came from
the Christian right they would have let us know by now, because they always
tend to exaggerate their influence and power.
While the effort to regulate the net had *links* to the Christian right, it
is simply untrue to say that it was composed of the Christian right, or even

role is scarcely visible.  They were minor foot soldiers.

of laws against acts that are malum prohibitum and not malum in se is to empower those that pass them, and the secondary purpose is

.. by jamesd It wasn't one member of the religious right who supplied the legal
arguments to defend the CDA. Multiple religious righters were involved.
Try Deen Kaplan, John McMickle, and Bruce Taylor, for starters.
McMickle, a protege of Taylor's, *wrote* Sen. Chuck Grassley's
net.indecency legislation. McMickle is a longtime anti-porn activist and
worked in an office shared by the National Law Center, the National
Coalition Against Pornography, and Enough is Enough! McMickle now works
for Grassley.
Christian Wrong. You are confusing what Enough is Enough! *purports* to be with
what it really is. I have written in earlier messages how Dee Jepsen
(Donna Rice's boss at Enough is Enough!) is affiliated with Pat
Robertson and other right-wing religious fanatics. (Robertson, the
founder of the Christian Coalition, said in 1993 that separation of
church and state is "a lie of the left," and "there is no such thing in
the Constitution.")
As for Marty, he's *not* an anti-porn activist. He loves porn! He was
used by the anti-porn activists to promote their agenda, and he used
them to promote himself. (If you have *any* evidence that he's an
anti-porn activist himself, I need to see it ASAP. His study was
attached to the DoJ's reply brief in our CDA lawsuit.)
Wrong. Incredibly wrong. Do you *know* who Bill Arms is? Have you ever
spoken with him, met with him, or debated him? I have. Arms is a former
vice president for computing services at CMU and was in *no* way
involved with the "effort to regulate the net." At best, he was a fall
guy for the censorship attempts here at CMU. (He had already been forced
to resign.)
James, to say anything else is a fantasy. Please tell me how exactly
Arms was involved in this telecom legislation's "effort to regulate the
net." Documentation, please.
The media's gullibility allowed the religious right to promote their
agenda. Cyberporn scares play better than arguments about free speech.
Wrong. Kaplan was an editor at the Georgetown Law Journal and pushed
through the approval of Rimm's study, bypassing normal channels, which
prompted TIME to run the cover. Kaplan is a vice president at the
National Coalition for Children and Families (with McMickle and Taylor),
formerly called the National Coalition Against Pornography. Oh, and the
NCAP/NCCF folks wrote Rimm's footnotes for his study.
Wrong. Rimm's study had only minor connections with the left. Catharine
MacKinnon was the only substantial "left" contact Rimm had, and she has
spoken *against* the CDA! If you know more, please share it with us.
Wrong. The big muscle did come from the religious right, but it is *not*
in their interests to advertise it since it would invalidate Rimm's
study even more. (Grassley called Rimm's study, on the Senate floor, an
impartial one by a respected university, not by an advocacy group.)
Since Rimm's study still has legs, the religious right has kept their
mouths shut.

the attempts to pressure Congress into censoring the Internet" and "in
the long run, one thing has become certain -- that the 'problem' of
pornography on the Net is essentially one that was constructed by Rimm
and the antiporn activists, differing in agendas but united in their
tactics." Mike also has an article in an upcoming Penthouse that will
reveal even more.

This provision of the bill makes the entire bill a worthless pile of repressive shit, despite all the pious good intentions
in the rest of the bill.
A little constitutional history:
The supreme court used to rule that congress could not delegate its own power to bureaucrats, as this violated the principle of rule of law.
Thus congress could pass a law than in a certain situation you had to do such and such, or refrain from doing so and so, but it could not pass a law that in a certain situation you had to do whatever some bureaucrat told you to do, because that would violate separation of powers and the principle of the rule of law, not men.
Roosevelt threatened to stack the court, the court submitted, and the rule
of law in the US was radically diminished.
The proposed bill would seem to give bureaucrats the power to set aside the
first, fourth, and fifth amendments, at whim.

There are several different interpretations of the most controversial

interpretation that I have seen that gives effect to the stated

can demand your secret key, and if you refuse to give it to him, you
get five years for obstruction.   If the objectionable parts mean
anything at all, they must *widen* the already alarmingly broad
concept of "obstruction of justice".
That is to say, of the many possible interpretations of this section,
the only one that gives effect to the stated purposes of this

Monsters, plain enough.  Very simple.  The complications only exist in the clouded minds of those who employ doublethink.
Shaw also visited the Gulag, as did many famous English leftists:  Here is his report on it:
  "Whereas in Britain a man enters prison a human being, and leaves prison    a criminal type, in Russia he entered prison a criminal type and would
   come out an ordinary man but for the difficulty of inducing him to come
   out at all.  As far as I could make out they could all stay as long as

dupes, their useful fools, such as H.G. Wells, who wrote of Stalin:

One mechanism for encrypting RTP would be to construct a shared secret

a cryptographically strong pseudo random data stream from the key, using
Ron's code, and for each RTP packet, encrypt using a block from that data stream as the packet key.

expect that, if he erred, he will not pay.
Now if Unicorn had proposed a bet for one hundred dollars, then
I would sit up and take notice.  A hundred dollars is real money.  Fifty thousand dollars is hot air, like one kid says, "I bet you I am right", and the other kid says "I bet you a zillion dollars you are wrong".
If somebody proposes a bet that is larger than the likely reputation cost of weaseling, we should ignore the bet and subtract from the guys reputation as if he had already weaseled, since the events of the extropian list show that that is the most likely outcome.

By this argument the Soviet Empire could never fall.
Governments are rarely overthrown.  Rather, they collapse.
Governments continually struggle to maintain cohesion. Sometimes they fail.  They do not naturally have cohesion.  A government is not naturally a single thing, not an entity by nature, the way a person is an entity by nature.
False on two counts:   First "frenzy" is exactly the opposite of what the government needs to stay in one piece, to continue to be a government.
Secondly, when you cut of someones air supply, they do not necessarily defend themselves.
I think I may have reported in cypherpunks my little experiment in Cuba when I cut off a cop's air supply, to test my hypothesis that even the cuban cops have a slave mentality.
People frequently fail to defend themselves, when suitably intimidated, and this is basically what governments rely upon.  If governments have to start

I intend to post this to a bunch of rant newsgroups.  It is the common
wisdom of cypherpunks:  Any corrections or objections?
   *************************************************************************
Why does the state still stand?
Now if the state had to compel everyone to write a check for ten thousand
dollars every quarter, or to make little trip to the IRS with a brown paper
bag full of hundred dollar bills, there would be massive tax resistance,
massive state violence to enforce taxes, and the many individual violent
conflicts with the state would swiftly become collective armed revolution. The state can get away with this extraordinary and exorbitant tax rate,
because for the most part it does not apply coercion directly to individual
people.  Instead it disrupts the large scale institutions that we have
created to facilitate large scale cooperation.
Now it is easy to coerce the transactions in physical marketplace, or a
physical large scale factory or office, because the state can easily find
the market place and see what people are doing in it, far easier than it can
find individual people and see what each person is doing overall, and if
people do not play by the state's rules it can easily send in the bad boys
to close down the marketplace.
Thus the state obstructs the large scale specialization of labor, and
charges us a high price to participate in that specialization.
The state can do this effectively because such specialization depends on
large numbers of people regularly meeting face to face in recognizable
physical places: company offices, stock exchanges, and the like.   The state
can extract this tax because it can send the bad boys into any such meeting
place and close it down. It is this, rather than direct coercion of taxpayers that enables it to
charge such savage and extraordinary taxes.  Any attempt to directly coerce
taxpayers on this scale would swiftly lead to rivers of blood.
Electronic marketplaces are less easy to coerce.  Note how states find
themselves largely powerless before the international money market.  This
has caused a substantial retreat of the state in many countries throughout
the world. The socialists complain because the World bank asks the Ukraine and Belarus
to be slightly less socialist, but the international money market will not
touch such governments with a ten foot pole, while it will roll over like a
puppy for governments such as Estonia and Tunisia which really are
dismantling socialism.
The challenge then is to move the meetings that make specialization of labor
possible to the net, thus making us less easy for the state to coerce.
The anarcho socialists have one half of an important truth: In order to
smash the state, we must first transform capitalism. Right now not much is happening.
Ecash today is rather like email eight years ago.  You had a bunch of email
systems none of which would talk to each other and none of which were very
easy to use and all of which cost too much.
Most good groupware, for example source code control programs, is designed,
perhaps intentionally, in ways that make it only useful for intranets, not
for WANs.  That is to say only useful inside the kind of corporations that
presently exist.  Also, to be useful in a post corporate economy, a source
code control tool would need to have better view control, since the boss
cannot simply announce.  "OK, we are now in alpha, so we shall now have
feature freeze on the product."  Instead somebody has to announce "I have
constructed and will maintain a feature frozen buildable source code view."
We would be vastly further ahead on PGP 3.0 and on ecash if we had a tool
like that.
How then did we solve the email problem?
The email problem was not a problem that big corporations were capable of
solving.  Whenever one network, such as Compuserv, negotiated with another
network, such as AOL they could never agree about settlements. How much
would compuserv charge AOL to deliver AOL customers mail to Compuserv
customers, and how much would AOL charge Compuserve to deliver Compuserve
customers mail to AOL customers.  And how would it be metered, and what
software standards would be used to enable the metering, and the lawyers
would talk to the accountants, and the accountants to the software guys, and
up and down the corporate hierarchy it would go, and back and forth between
Eventually, on the internet, the custom and expectation grew up that you did
not charge for delivering mail to your customers, largely due to the
influence, and the moral and political outlook, of the IETF.   Problem solved:  Nothing to negotiate;  Nothing to be metered.  Turned out
it was a moral and political problem, not a pricing problem.
Now right now we are in the same pickle with electronic transactions as we
once were with email.  We have a bunch of proprietary systems with
proprietary software and proprietary money that do not talk to each other. Worse, anonymous ecash is patented by Chaum.  This is an algorithm for how
people  structure promises to pay, and is therefor even less well suited to
be intellectual property than most software patents. As a result anyone who
wants to make an agreement with Chaum to implement anonymous electronic cash
faces a lot of cost and delay.  Such agreements are difficult to make and
What we need in addition to our existing electronic cash mechanisms is a
general mechanism for exchanging and transferring promises to pay, so that
Betty can exchange a promise by John to pay in system X for a promise by Sam
to pay in system Y.  Such a system must make every man their own bank and
their own credit agency, and must not be tied to any one proprietary
institution that issues promises to pay.
Now once we have that, it will cobble all the different ecash systems
together, just as the internet cobbled all the email systems together, and
we will start to make some real progress in moving the institutions that
facilitate large scale specialization of labor to the net.  Right now
nothing much is happening, despite the fact that several big names have
issued ecash systems.
Now in order to create such a system we need a patent free public key
system: (Rabin will be free from the DH patent in one year) and we need a
satisfactory public key management system, one that can couple to standard
databases.  Lots of folk are twiddling their thumbs waiting for Phil
Zimmermann to issue the PGP 3.0 key management system.  Possibly someone
will issue a PGP key management system that works with the Microsoft Crypt
API.   The Microsoft default key management system is crummy, and is limited
to keys small enough for the NSA to break.
So guys, that is the plan:  We destroy the state through higher mathematics.
We do this by replacing the current institutional mechanisms of corporations
with cryptographic mechanisms.  This will give more people the opportunity
to evade and resist taxes.

I expect that as corporations move to the net, they will not have the
highly centralized structure of existing corporations.  In any case
this structure is in large part imposed by the state in order to facilitate tax collection.  For example the existence of the "Human resources department" is largely the result of state coercion of corporations.  In web businesses ones primary relationship will be with ones immediate coworkers, rather than
the greater corporation.
They will consist rather of a network of relationships -- contracting
will move up, and the Keiretsu structure will move down.  I expect
the institutional structure will resemble that of the mafia -- a loose
confederation of networks rather than tight whole. Thus defection
by one party can only cause limited damage.
In my judgement the Keiretsu form of economic organization is growing in large part because of improved communications and lowered communication costs.
The Keiretsu form does not in itself facilitate tax evasion, but it
does mean that the state has to apply coercion more directly to
more people in order to collect taxes, and that its coercion has to be more visibly arbitrary and disruptive.
In order to do business, one will need a good name (or good nym).
If one does not have a good name, one will be poor.  That is why
I said "every man his own credit bureau".
Existing forms of ecash are costly and inconvenient, hence unsuitable
for spending in tiny quantities.  I expect that
in the not very distant future every shop will offer its own cash,
and that some of these will be in the form of millicents -- suitable
for automatic lightly supervised transactions between computers.  I expect the transaction cost advantage will eventually be on the side
of electronic money, rather than physical money.

A nym would like to know what the total amount of such signed obligation is,
so that he can be sure it is less than the total value of the institutions good name and readily findable and confiscatable assets.
But we do not want a bunch of outsiders getting a list of lots of private
information about who owns what, (such as auditors who are usually in the
pockets of the tax collectors).   The institution needs to be able
to prove that it only owes total amount X in this form, without letting Tom, Dick, and Harry know who it owes amount X to, and why.
To do this it organizes its accounts in a binary tree, and constructs a one
way checksum tree checksum, revealing to each custom the part of the tree he
is on, all the way up to the root, which must be the same for all customers,
and must be placed in some public place, so that any customer can tell that his account is included in the total openly admitted obligations of the institution, and any customer can, by revealing secret information, prove that he is one of the people that the institution has publicly admitted owing money to.

Say Jim, did you major in sociology literature:
Here is Dave Barry on college and truth:
   After you've been in college for a year or so, you're supposed to
 choose a major, which is the subject you intend to memorize and  forget the most things about.  Here is a very important piece of  advice: Be sure to choose a major that does not involve Known Facts  and Right Answers.
  This means you must *not* major in mathematics, physics, biology,
 or chemistry, because these subjects involve actual facts.  If, for  example, you major in mathematics, you're going to wander into class  one day and the professor will say: "Define the cosine integer of  the quadrant of a rhomboid binary axis, and extrapolate your result  to five significant vertices." If you don't come up with *exactly*  the answer the professor has in mind, you fail.  The same is true of  chemistry: if you write in your exam book that carbon and hydrogen  combine to form oak, your professor will flunk you.  He wants you to  come up with the same answer he and all the other chemists have  agreed on.  Scientists are extremely snotty about this.
   So you should major in subjects like English, philosophy,
 psychology, and sociology -- subjects in which nobody really  understands what anybody else is talking about, and which involve  virtually no actual facts.  I attended classes in all these  subjects, so I'll give you a quick overview of each:
 read little snippets of just before class.  Here is a tip on how to  get good grades on your English papers: Never say anything about a  book that anybody with any common sense would say.  For example,  suppose you are studying Moby-Dick.  Anybody with any common sense  would say that Moby-Dick is a big white whale, since the characters  in the book refer to it as a big white whale roughly eleven thousand  times.  So in *your* paper, *you* say Moby-Dick is actually the  Republic of Ireland.  Your professor, who is sick to death of  reading papers and never liked Moby-Dick anyway, will think you are  enormously creative.  If you can regularly come up with lunatic  interpretations of simple stories, you should major in English.
   PHILOSOPHY: Basically, this involves sitting in a room and
 deciding there is no such thing as reality and then going to lunch.  You should major in philosophy if you plan to take a lot of drugs.
   PSYCHOLOGY: This involves talking about rats and dreams.
 Psychologists are *obsessed* with rats and dreams.  I once spent an  entire semester training a rat to punch little buttons in a certain  sequence, then training my roommate to do the same thing.  The rat  learned much faster.  My roommate is now a doctor.
   If you like rats or dreams, and above all if you dream about rats,
 you should major in psychology.
   SOCIOLOGY: For sheer lack of intelligibility, sociology is far and
 away the number one subject.  I sat through hundreds of hours of  sociology courses, and read gobs of sociology writing, and I never  once heard or read a coherent statement.  This is because  sociologists want to be considered scientists, so they spend most of  their time translating simple, obvious observations into  scientific-sounding code.  If you plan to major in sociology, you'll  have to learn to do the same thing.  For example, suppose you have  observed that children cry when they fall down.  You should write:  "Methodological observation of the sociometrical behavior tendencies  of prematurated isolates indicates that a casual relationship exists  between groundward tropism and lachrimatory, or 'crying,' behavior  forms." If you can keep this up for fifty or sixty pages, you will  get a large government grant.

@_subject: NOISE: "Fascism is corporatism" 
Like someone who cannot resist looking at a dreadful traffic
accident, I continue to participate in this Detweiler inspired
Fascism is of course a reasonably complete, coherent, and philosophically consistent logical system, almost as coherent as marxism, and far more logical than Mill's utilitarianism.  It was published and thoroughly debated well before they pursued or took power.
Rich Graves's lie is a lie I frequently hear from those who well know the truth, Many of my readers will think I am excessively harsh, calling Rich
Graves a liar rather than a fool, but I hear the above story (that fascism is not a coherent ideology or philosophy) primarily from
those whose interests this story serves, and if they genuinely thought this story was true, they would not know that it is in their
interests to push it.
Therefore one may reasonably conclude that most who push this story
are knowingly lying, that it is a widespread lie, not a widespread
fallacy or an alternate interpretation of the truth.
I mostly hear it from those whose economic ideology strongly resembles fascism, or those whose philosophy is directly descended from fascism, is in fact fascist philosophy.  Rich's economic ideology does not seem to resemble fascism, so I would guess he is in the second category
but not the first.  Most PC folk are postmodernists, poststructuralists,
deconstructionists, etc, which philosophies directly descend from fascist philosophy, and he seems to be PC, so this would explain his peculiar
assertion above.
Not only do such concepts as feminist science, phallocentric science, etc, strongly resemble such concepts as aryan science, jewish science, etc, but they are justified using the same arguments from the same philosophers.  Indeed Heidegger was not only a philosopher of fascism, but he personally participated in Hitler's terror, terrorizing his academic
colleagues, and Paul De Man of Yale University worked directly for the Nazis as a propagandist in occupied Belgium.
Hence the frequent lie by those who share this monstrous philosophy, that the fascists had no philosophy.

@_subject: [NOISE] "Fascism is corporatism" 
[A whole bunch of totally irrelevant boring distractions, amongst them]:
To argue that fascism has no philosophy without mentioning Maurice Barres is
nearly as silly as arguing that communism has no philosophy without mentioning
Marx.  If you delete all reference to Fascist philosophers, you will of course
come to the conclusion that fascism has no coherent philosophy.
Fascism got its epistemology from Barres, and its economic theory from Sorel.
Your argument is analogous to someone who argues that communism had no coherent philosophy by talking about Mao as if he had popped out of nowhere, and failing to mention Marx and Lenin.
In my opinion the most coherent fascist philosopher that preceded the fascist rise to power was Maurice Barres. (Of course once fascism was on the rise, you got a bunch more fascist philosophers, most of them way to the left of Barres.) This thread in philosophy has continued to the present day, though it was abruptly renamed after the defeat of Hitler.  Barres's arguments are logically and philosophically coherent, and are clearly and unambiguously recognizable as the epistemology, and much of the claptrap and rhetoric of fascism, and as the epistemology, and much of the claptrap and rhetoric of modern PC, and we can trace the philosophical thread connecting modern PC to Barres through known Nazi philosophers who not merely philosophized, but also participated actively in Hitler's regime, and to direct and immediate disciples of those philosophers, such as Derrida.
Perhaps I was elliptical in the above.  I will restate:
The claim that fascism lacks an economic program and/or a philosophy comes primarily from those whose economic program and/or philosophy bears a
marked resemblance to fascism.   If they were not aware of this resemblance
they would not so vigorously seek to redefine fascism as military dictatorship, racism, etc.
This leads me to doubt the basic human honesty of those who push this line,
and their concern for human lives.
Revisionism alert:  I just deleted vast chunks of text from your message above where you presented negative evidence that fascism had no philosophy, and I was just thinking that maybe I had overdone it and would get flamed for deleting arguments rather than answering them.
Revisionism alert:
Tim gave a perfectly correct definition of corporatism, and you then
proceeded to give a very similar definition, and you then proceeded to smear Tim by falsely implying that he gave a silly ignorant definition, radically different to the one he did in fact give.
You also have carefully avoided mentioning Sorel, who of course advocated roughly the economic problem that Mussolini attempted to implement, that
Hitler did implement, and that Timothy May condemned, long before Mussolini
got of the ground.  Sure sounds like an economic ideology to me.
Yeah, right, And the only fifty thousand jews were murdered.  :-)
Historical Revisionism alert:  The above is wildly implausible:  You do not call Nazism a disease in Nazi Germany and live to tell of it, let alone call Nazism a disease and get appointed to the important and well paid job of terrorizing your academic colleagues.
The above is also infamously false:  As rector, Heidegger denounced those of his colleagues he wished murdered as jews, including his own teacher, and he organized paramilitary camps for his students, spouting martial rhetoric about the "inner truth and greatness of National Socialism," see citation below.
Historical Revisionism alert:  See  for how he is REALLY Heidegger himself claimed at the time, his political activities grew out of his philosophy, and this claim seems to me to be very obviously true.
Indeed what he claimed then is equivalent to what I have been telling you in
public and private email:  That your ideas lead to people being murdered by
the state, and therefore you should consider them more carefully.
Historical revisionism alert:
His most infamous work was his laudatory speech on Hitler given when he was appointed rector of Freiburg.  In addition he never disowned his works on the "jewish problem".  As rector he imposed Nazism on his colleagues by the usual means.
The fact that Paul de Man's philosophy had a very strong resemblance to fascist philosophy was discovered considerably earlier.  The fact that he also wrote the kinds of racist propaganda that are no longer politically correct was merely the icing on the cake.

Believe it or not, this has some very slight cypherpunk relevance.  (Gasp)
When news media were concentrated into fewer and fewer hands during the twentieth century, the appearance of neutrality, objectivity, and authoritativeness became a major selling point, and so media adopted a tone and manner of neutrality, with an accompanying "just-the-facts" style, though in reality they became far less neutral
Now that everyone can grab the megaphone, people are not so worried
about objectivity.  If something is unfair to Nazis or blacks or evil
polluting capitalists, they know they will hear about it from the Nazis, the blacks or the evil polluting capitalists.
As a result, people no longer value the superficial appearance of neutrality and objectivity.  Suddenly colorful and openly biased reporting has become popular.  This has led to some people engaging in florid excesses of colorful style and concocting totally phony attitudes., just as when word processing programs first gained the capability to handle a wide variety of fonts, some people produced memos that looked like ransom notes.
Soon enough they will settle down.  English prose was at its greatest in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when many voices could be heard, and some of them were on the florid side.

Example;  Suppose only two are left:  Then No. 19 get everything, and No. 20 gets nothing.  So if only three are left, it will maximize 20's return to vote for a proposal by number 18, that number 18 gets 19,999,999 dollars, and number 20 gets one dollar
But suppose that number 20 announces in advance that he considers
an unequal division morally wrong, and will always vote against
any unequal division.  If this threat is credible, which it is,
number 18 will have no choice but to propose an equal split, so
number 20 now gets 6,666,666 dollars, instead of one dollar.
Now if number 20 had threatened to vote against any proposal that
did not split the money equally between himself, and number 18,
thus going for ten million instead of six million, this threat
would be less credible, and he would very likely have wound up
with one dollar.

A pipe bomb is a device for getting a decent explosion
out of a low explosive, such as gunpowder.
A low explosive combusts relatively slowly.  The purpose
of the pipe is to hold it together for long enough to get
decent pressure.
Homemade low explosives tend to be even more feeble than manufactured low explosives, because it is inadvisable
for amateurs to recorn their powder, with the result that
home made powders burn slow, whereas homemade high
explosives are just as effective as manufactured high My theoretical expectation is that pipe bombs would be very ineffectual when compared to high explosives, especially using home made powders.
Note that very large pipe bombs can be made by using propane cylinders or compressed gas cylinders in place of pipes.

Many companies, for example Informix, have campuses here and

in Europe.  These campuses are linked by private televideo
connections, private voice mail systems, and the internet.
So theoretically a programmer in India should be much the same

where he lives.
Yet these companies continually spend vast sums of money on
politicians, lawyers, and perhaps bureaucrats, in
order to get their engineers out of India, so that they can pay
them more than ten times as much in some foreign country.
Informix has facilities in the US that are staffed mostly by Indians.  Why did it not leave these teams in India, where they would cost less than a tenth as much?
Clearly therefore, the same man is more than ten times as
valuable to them when he is not in India.
Since the communications are pretty much the same wherever he
is located, what makes the difference?
The power of the Indian government over that man and his work
makes the difference.
That man is poor because he is more subject to the power of the
state, which values him no more than any other expendable
slave, than he is contractually subject to those who value what
he can do.

You are wrong, and Perry is wrong, or rather you are misleading,
and Perry is wrong.
The statement "wages depend on the amount of capital invested". can have several meanings.  In the hands of the Austrians, it does not have the implications that you force on it, and this is what Perry ought to be complaining about,
though instead he is saying something quite different.
Obviously if everyone saves more money and invests it those
things that they find most profitable, this will raise both
total income and wages.
Obviously if the government takes control of other peoples
capital, and directs it to those places it finds most socially desirable, this will lower both total income
and wages.   I assume we are in agreement so far.
Next question:  If the government restrains american businessmen
from investing outside America, will this alter the balance of
power between capital and labor inside America, in favor of labor,
while altering it against labor outside America.
Well if nothing else changed, yes it would, and if Perry denied
this he was wrong.
But of course capital is international, because it belongs to individuals, not to nations.  Since large amounts of money flow
in and out of the US, a bureaucratic intervention that
aimed to have the desired effect would have to be extensive
and drastic, amounting to fascist style socialism.
Again, I assume we are in agreement on this.
Next question:
     Competition between labor in the third world, and labor in      the US.
In those cases where labor is a minor factor in production, then the price of labor would be dominated by the cheapest source of labor.
Or rather the cheapest source of labor that is not controlled
by a government that capriciously robs and enslaves.  At present
the cheapest such labor source is probably Thailand, which is not
actually all that cheap these days, but is one hell of a lot cheaper
than the US.
But for *desirable jobs*, such as software engineering, the jobs
that people are getting excited about, the cost of labor in Thailand
is roughly comparable to the cost in America.
The kind of jobs that are being taken by cheap unskilled Thai labor,
are the jobs you cannot get anyone to do in America except for illegal immigrants.
We would expect this, because in any area where labor is the dominant
factor of production (such as engineering) a large supply of cheap labor will very swiftly CREATE the necessary capital.
Again, you might point to India as an infamous counter example, since
engineering labor is vastly cheaper in India.
But this is not a result of supply and demand causing an extreme misdistribution of wealth between capital and labor, but is a reflection of
the fact that an engineer who is subject to the power of the Indian
government is not worth very much, as is demonstrated by the fact
that companies with Indian engineering teams often spend a lot of money
to get their employees out of India.
Demand for Indian programmers is less than supply not because capital
has somehow failed to flow to India, but because an engineer in India
is not free to produce the value that engineers elsewhere are free
to produce.
To say the same thing another way:  The primary capital for engineers
is that held within engineers heads.  Therefore controls on capital
flows are controls on engineers, which are likely to benefit those doing the controlling, not those controlled.

So?  What does this have to do with the price of fish?
Are Informix campuses "highly decoupled economies".
The fact is a company like Informix has a campus in India, and
it has campuses in the US that are largely staffed by Indian teams,
and it will pay big bucks to get its people out of India, even
though it has to pay them more than ten times as much in the US.
An Indian programmer doing the same job for the same company is
more than ten times as valuable to that company if he is not subject to the power of the Indian government, as proven by that
companies actions.
Plainly Informix does not like the power of the Indian government,
which is no surprise as a few years ago just about every company on
earth utterly detested the power of the Indian government and would
not touch the place with a ten foot pole.

That was not an explanation, that was mystic word salad.  It would be an explanation if wealth mysteriously rained
from the sky, rather than was produced by men.
In fact what gets sent to the Indian campus is largely legacy
work, which is in large part precisely the work that requires the closest contact with the customer, contact with actual working conditions, and the like.
This seems to be a general practice, not just an Informix practice, for
in an article on "India's silicon valley" I read that the work done in
India was largely done on existing legacy apps, often in obsolete
languages and operating systems.
This is of course the work that places the least amount of the
companies intellectual assets in India, and thus the work that
gives the Indian government the least power over Informix and its
activities.  Informix could abandon the Indian campus and all
the intellectual assets on which it was working, and all the
physical assets located there, at any moment and not suffer any serious loss or inconvenience.
It is overwhelmingly clear that the question is simply who has the power?  Those who wish to hire peoples services in order to produce
wealth, or those who can command peoples services because they have

Late last year the organized violence monopolies of the world voted to give Bill Gates 400 Megahertz of bandwidth, at the same frequency in each monopoly.  I would guesstimate the value of this grant to be around ten billion dollars.  Don't run out and buy Microsoft shares.  When I said Bill Gates, I meant Bill Gates.  I did not mean Microsoft.
Bill Gates intends to build an internet in the sky, eight hundred satellites in low earth orbit, each of them with big bandwidth connections to its nearest neighbors, and each with a four hundred megahertz connection to each of many squares of ground underneath it.
What caused the collected killers of the world to show such unanimous
generosity towards Bill Gates?
Bill Gates proposed a network that would be completely censorable.
He will not sell pipes to his space backbone, he will sell pipes
from a particular rectangle on the ground to its space backbone.
You would buy a right to connect from any place in a single small
area, not any a right to connect from any place in the world, and Bill Gates would only sell such rights to government approved organizations, which would then presumably resell connections
to private individuals -- connections that would first run through
government controlled pipes to check for politically incorrect bits
before they reached Bill Gates' sky backbone.
Of course we should not condemn him too harshly for this:  He needs
approval from Singapore, Iran, France, Germany, Communist China, and the like, in order to get a single uniform world wide frequency band, and would be unlikely to get it for any reasonable proposal.
The government pipes in his proposal are as useless as wheels on
a fish, because he promises his ground stations will be quite Therefore private citizens who are not permitted direct access
to his internet in the sky will feel the impact of tyranny
immediately in their wallets.
Bill Gates internet in the sky will provide short and near
constant latency, therefore telephone connections running
through it should be pretty good, whereas existing internet
phone sucks mightily.
Teledesic is promised to come on line in 2001, though we have
seen how Microsoft meets schedules in the past.  I conjecture 2006.  I also predict that once the scheme is securely
in place, and jamming it becomes painful, Bill Gates
will find a thousand ways to chisel the government monopoly middlemen in his proposal.
I would guess that Motorola's less ambitious Iridium project
will only be a year or two late, but it has little potential

First, you have this completely the wrong way around:  Prosperity is
the product of a free society.  For example when the Dutch revolted

Secondly there is ample counter evidence:  For example in America
before the european conquest, some Indian societies were extremely
free and others, such as the Incas, had institutions very similar to modern totalitarianism, yet their material level was very different to today's, and not very different from each others.
Again the Germanic tribes that conquered England had very high levels
of liberty, yet were terribly poor, and the Icelanders of Saga period
Iceland were very free, yet very poor.

@_subject: Why organizations turn statist. 
The EFF is ultimately a business lobby group, because it gets
most of its funding from businesses.  It is therefore potentially
subject to the same corruption as other business lobbies.
Business lobby groups are intermediaries, and therefore serve
two masters, both the politicians and the businessmen, not one
master.  Frequently they serve the interests of the politicians
at the expense of their donors, at the expense of the goals
that the lobby group is supposed to pursue.
Suppose for example you have a lobby group that
represents the widget industry.
On the one hand, the CEO of General Widgets might ring them up and say: "We are being trashed by these great japanese widgets, and unless something is done about it we might have to reduce prices or improve quality", and the lobby organization has a little chat with some tame politicians about the terrible suffering the Japanese are inflicting on American workers.   That is the way lobby groups are supposed to work, but seldom do.
On the other hand sometimes the politician (or a
gofer on his staff), rings the lobby and says:  "I need a
million dollars fast:  What potential political action gets the
chairman of General Widgets waking up in a cold sweat in the
middle of the night?  What could destroy the widget industry, and yet be politically feasible?"  Shortly thereafter the lobbyist has a little chat with chairman of General Widgets about forthcoming legislation.  The lobby group
gets a big bag of money, some of which it passes on to
the politician, and the threatened legislation evaporates until the next election.
To be a successful lobby group, the EFF needs to get its
fingerprints on legislation, so that it can make threats and
promises to businessmen in the computer industry.
Thus the EFF's best interests as an organization are contrary
to our desires and contrary to the announced aims of the organization.  Legislation, any legislation, is in their interests and legislation, any legislation is against our Our interests, and the EFF's interest are opposed with no
apparent mutual good possible.
Now it is possible that the EFF is virtuously pursuing its
supposed goals, rather than its practical interests.  We should
consider the available evidence in order to infer what it is
in fact up to.
According to Dave Barry the word "politics" derives
from the Greek "poly" meaning many, and "ticks"
meaning small disgusting bloodsucking parasites.
In order to be well funded, the EFF needs government
regulation of the net.  The kind of regulation that would be
most effective in ensuring large donations would be regulation
that compels internet businessmen to lobby the government.
for example regulations that make impossible, inconsistent, and
contradictory requirements on those who provide software,
hardware, and services, for example a demand that big
companies police the net in ways that even governments would
find extremely difficult, such as the British child porn
crackdown, or legislation which if properly crafted would have the effect of giving some businessmen a monopoly of some aspect of the net, and putting other businessmen out of business,  for example legislation that requires case by case approval of software, or legislation that compels
the businessman to invade his customers privacy, and also
prohibits him from invading that privacy unless he has a
waiver issued by the state.

@_subject: the theory of split currency 
Many third world nations employed this system, one currency for internal use only, and one currency for international transactions.  The international currency was sometimes denominated in hard currency, and reasonably convertible into it.
This strategy was frequently associated with police state tactics,
lawless imprisonment, and swift execution, for vaguely defined
economic crimes.  It has become substantially less common in
the nineties.
The external currency tended to spread into the internal economy,
despite police state measures to prevent this from happening,
and the internal currency tended to become worthless and could only be
spent while holding a gun to the head of the person accepting In countries employing this system, women, and often children
of both sexes, are often cheaply available for sexual purposes
if you have foreign currency.
I speculate that this is because people find that they *must* obtain foreign currency, the internal currency being
unspendable, and any method available to them for obtaining foreign
currency is a criminal offense.
A retreat from this system, usually by allowing the international
currency to freely penetrate the internal economy, tends to be associated with a substantial reduction in the availability
of young girls, as for example in Cuba recently.

This will also help the government protect the citizen unit from exposure to dangerous and harmful thoughts and ideas.

Suppose you need 80 bits of entropy.
If your passphrase is truly random, for example

You have about six bits a character, so you only need thirteen characters.
If, however, your pass phrase is an intelligible english sentence, for example

You only have about one bit per character, so you need an eighty character sentence.

Business lobby groups are intermediaries, and therefore serve
two masters, both the politicians and the businessmen, not one
master.  Frequently they serve the interests of the politicians
at the expense of their donors, at the expense of the goals
that the lobby group is supposed to pursue.
This is a bunch of crap:  It is highly likely that no bill will go
through.  Most bills die.   This bill should die.
Killing bills is always politically safer than passing them, doing nothing cannot get you into trouble.
This is untrue and dishonest.  No bill at all is the best step forward,
and doing nothing is always easiest to attain.
The CDT is ultimately a business lobby group, because it gets
most of its funding from businesses.  It is therefore potentially
subject to the same corruption as other business lobbies.
Business lobby groups are intermediaries, and therefore serve
two masters, both the politicians and the businessmen, not one
master.  Frequently they serve the interests of the politicians
at the expense of their donors, at the expense of the goals
that the lobby group is supposed to pursue.
Suppose for example you have a lobby group that
represents the widget industry.
On the one hand, the CEO of General Widgets might ring them up and say: "We are being trashed by these great japanese widgets, and unless something is done about it we might have to reduce prices or improve quality", and the lobby organization has a little chat with some tame politicians about the terrible suffering the Japanese are inflicting on American workers.   That is the way lobby groups are supposed to work, but seldom do.
On the other hand sometimes the politician (or a
gofer on his staff), rings the lobby and says:  "I need a
million dollars fast:  What potential political action gets the
chairman of General Widgets waking up in a cold sweat in the
middle of the night?  What could destroy the widget industry, and yet be politically feasible?"  Shortly thereafter the lobbyist has a little chat with chairman of General Widgets about forthcoming legislation.  The lobby group
gets a big bag of money, some of which it passes on to
the politician, and the threatened legislation evaporates until the next election.
To be a successful lobby group, the CDT needs to get its
fingerprints on legislation, so that it can make threats and
promises to businessmen in the computer industry.
Thus the CDT's best interests as an organization are contrary
to our desires and contrary to the announced aims of the organization.  Legislation, any legislation, is in their interests and legislation, any legislation is against our Our interests, and the CDT's interest are opposed with no
apparent mutual good possible.
Now it is possible that the CDT is virtuously pursuing its
supposed goals, rather than its practical interests.  We should
consider the available evidence in order to infer what it is
in fact up to.
According to Dave Barry the word "politics" derives from the Greek "poly" meaning many, and "ticks" meaning small disgusting bloodsucking parasites.
In order to be well funded, the CDT needs government
regulation of the net.  The kind of regulation that would be
most effective in ensuring large donations would be regulation
that compels internet businessmen to lobby the government.
for example regulations that make impossible, inconsistent, and
contradictory requirements on those who provide software,
hardware, and services, for example a demand that big
companies police the net in ways that even governments would
find extremely difficult, such as the British child porn
crackdown, or legislation which if properly crafted would have the effect of giving some businessmen a monopoly of some aspect of the net, and putting other businessmen out of business,  for example legislation that requires case by case approval of software, or legislation that compels
the businessman to invade his customers privacy, and also
prohibits him from invading that privacy unless he has a
waiver issued by the state.

In fact, the problem is not corporate sponsors.  Rather the problem is
that lobbying groups often tend to get captured by the government.  They want
to get their fingerprints on legislation, so that they can extort money
from their corporate sponsors, and are therefore eager to do the politicians bidding in any way whatever in order that they can get their fingerprints on
any legislation whatever.
This problem is unrelated to civil liberties issues.  Lobby groups for
the milk industry, small business, etc, are infamous for selling out the
interests of the businesses that support them.
I am not saying that the CDT is guilty of this, but the fact it persists
in trying to get legislation passed under present circumstances should not only alarm civil libertarians, it should also alarm big business.

An OLE extension to visual basic, providing elliptic curve

This was written for my own purposes. I wrote it because visual basic is the by far the fastest way of creating a certain kind of program with a reasonably acceptable user interface. However I believe it will be generally useful to anyone who wishes to create a cryptographic program that

Here is a method to render Man in the Middle audible on a telephone
Before speech can be encrypted, it is digitized and compressed.  It
is turned into digital packets.  There is some choice in the size
and other properties of the digital packets.
Suppose that Bob's computer from time to time formulates a plan to
do groups of a particular size and form, and sends Ann's computer a
hash of that plan and the DH negotiated shared secret.
Malloc (the man in the middle) cannot send this hash to Ann's computer
for Ann would discover the shared secret she is using is not the same
as the shared Bob is using.
So his computer must formulate its own plan, and send its own hash, which will not agree with Bob's plan, because Bob's computer does
not reveal the plan except by actually sending the packets.
So malloc must decompress Bob's speech packets, repacketize them, and recompress them,
Often he will not be able to send off a packet, until he has received two of Bob's packets.
So this triples the delay, and increases the speech degradation.
This should quite noticeable, noticeable enough to provoke Bob
and Ann into verifying their connection by reading the hash
digits of their shared secret.

If Alice wants to send something her boss should not read, perhaps she

Sending a copy of everything Alice receives to the boss or HR is not OK.
Alice should get to control it.
It would be acceptable for the company system to keep track of what
Alice has received, and flag "Alice received something, and has not

It is not acceptable to just plain snoop on what Alice receives.
Alice needs finer granuality of control.  The leakage to her boss primarily
affects her, rather than the sender.
Furthermore any auto-snoop feature sets a very dangerous precedent.
It is politically a lot more difficult for the FBI to mandate that they

@_subject: Please Beta test my communications cryptography product. 
--
I have produced a program that, like PGP, provides digital
signatures and communications encryption.
This is the first beta.  Please beta test this product.
The important difference between it and other products
that provide digital signatures and encryption is that it
is not certificate based.  Instead it is signature based.
This eliminates the steep initial learning and management curves of existing products.  The user does not need use and manage specialized certificates except for specialized purposes
The big complexity and user hostility in existing products is
creating and managing certificates.
Perhaps more importantly, it also eliminates the threat we
saw in England, the threat of the government giving itself
a monopoly in certificate distribution, potentially creating the Number-Of-The-Beast system, where you need a government
certificate to log on to dirty picture sites, to buy, to
sell, to put up web pages.
The key feature of the proposed product is that any digitally signed document can be stored in the database, and itself performs the functions of a certificate, just as a normal handwritten signature does.  The user usually does not need to check a document against a certificate to see if it was signed by the "real" John Doe.  Instead he normally checks one document against another to see if they were both signed by the same John Doe.   And similarly when he encrypts a document, he does not need to use a certificate to encrypt a message to the one real John Doe, he merely encrypts a message to the same John Doe who signed the letter he is replying to.
At present people have to deal with certificate management problems regardless of whether they really need certificates.
For example the most common usage of PGP is to check that two signatures that purport to be by the same person are in fact by the same person.   Unfortunately you cannot check one signature against another directly using PGP or any of the other existing products.  Instead you have to check both signatures against a public key certificate, even if the authentication information in that certificate is irrelevant to your purpose, which it usually is, which means that you have to download the certificate from somewhere, and the person signing it had to upload it somewhere.  As PGP always checks a document against the certificate, rather than against any other document the user happens to feel is relevant to the question, the person signing the document needs to get his certificate properly signed by some widely trusted third party, which is too much trouble or too complicated for many people.

    Many businessmen use a faxed signature for a contract, or for
    authority to act, or worse still, a shared password, as
    stockbrokers often do.  This is almost worthless.
    The signature on a fax can be, and often is, a mere bitmap,
    not genuinely scanned in from a signature written in ink on a
    paper document, but merely applied digitally to an image in
    computer memory.  If that bitmap was also applied to some
    other document sent to the same company, which it usually
    was, then the fax proves nothing.
    On the other hand, often one cannot wait for FedEx to deliver
    signed documents.   The answer is digital signatures and
    encryption. With digitally-signed electronic documents, you
    can send unforgeable signed documents instantaneously across
    the globe.
    Crypto Kong is easy to use and it uses the same identity
    model that as businesses today use for ordinary handwritten
    signatures,  unlike other products which impose their own
    different way of handling identity.
    Crypto Kong takes away the hassles of certificate management,
    public key authentication, and complicated operating
    instructions.  Anyone can immediately use it to sign
    documents, to compare signatures  or to encrypt sensitive
    messages.  Kong compares the signatures on documents, rather
    than comparing a signature against certificates.
    Crypto Kong software makes it easy to send or receive
    digitally signed documents or use top grade encryption to
    keep messages private.
    Crypto Kong provides support for contracts and the
    documentation that accompanies transactions.

Well I am not "reinventing the wheel".
Crypto Kong implements a different identity model.  It does
not suppose that there are "true names".
This leads to substantially easier identity management
(largely by abolishing identity management)
As a necessary consequence of this, if you happen to be
communicating with two different Bob Jones, Crypto Kong does
not attempt to discover which one is the one true Bob Jones
and which is the evil man in the middle Bob Jones.  It merely
keeps them distinct by applying different labels to them.
Secondly, PGP simply is not being adopted by the masses.  Of
course right now, two weeks after release, Crypto Kong is not
being adopted by the masses either, but with very little
identity management, it is far easier for the masses to use.
If you try and shove that identity stuff onto people they
will not do it.  Too much like hard work.  They will happily
let the government licensed authorities do it for them.  The

Thanks, though this sounds like a silly judgment.
It looks to me as if the great majority of judges and lawyers, and hence presumably the great majority of CEOs, are blissfully unaware that one can do anything with a fax other than scan it in from paper and ink at one end, while it is printed out on paper and ink at the other end.
In actual fact a very large proportion of faxes never see paper and ink at either end, creating endless opportunities for manipulation.

Why are blind signatures dead in the water?
One obvious reason is that people attempting to do business
with  David Chaum seem to get rather irritable.
Still, despite that, Digicash actually exists, but no one
uses it.
One reason is that the network to convert Digicash into
other forms of value is rather limited, whereas the credit
card network is fast and spans the world.
Another is that people do not wish to hold large amounts of
Digicash] for long periods, (security, no interest) and
converting money back and forth between interest bearing
forms and Digicash attracts  rather high charges. (Or used to
attract rather high charges when last I looked.)
So where do we go from here?
One obvious solution is nymous money-- money that is not
anonymous, but is not required to be connected to one's
government approved and  registered name either.  This is
arguably better than the half-anonymous  money that has in
fact been implemented by Digicash.

You are getting out of date.  As the rule of law dissolves,
legal issues become insignificant, and will in due course
vanish altogether.
For example nobody knows what are the "legal issues" with
putting strong crypto on a web site, as I have done.
According to what the legislation says, what I have done is
completely in accord with legislation.  Indeed, it is
completely in accord with US legislation simply to post the
stuff. on any server inside the US, the foreigner doing the
download is violating the legislation, not the person who put
it up.  I have gone considerably further than is required by
legislation, though not nearly as far as some others have
But mere legislation counts for less and less these days.  If
you read the business press, you will frequently read them
complain of cases where the distinctions between executive,
legal, and judicial powers are effectively dissolved, and
penalties are in effect adminstratively applied for undefined
offences, or retrospectively and administratively defined
offences, often in ways that appear to personally enrich those
administering these quasi judicial powers.
Generally this sort of thing is only applied to people who
are unpleasant and unpopular.  Tobacco companies, junk bond
merchants whose businesses have been more profitable for
themselves than for many of their investors, and the like.
Of course this creates a large vested interest in demonizing
more and more people, so that more and more people can be
dealt with in this fashion.
Similar measures are applied not only to alleged recreational
drug distributors, but to lawyers who defend alleged
recreational drug distributors, but the business press tends
to report such cases less. Meanwhile formerly totalitarian countries, such as China and
Cuba, where there used to be no such things as laws, merely
some people having the power to harm other people, power
exercised in accordance with rules that those subject to this
power were forbidden to know, are moving towards the rule of
law.  It used to be that if someone imprisoned in Cuba were
to discover the actual reason for his imprisonment, he might
possibly suffer some draconian additional punishment for
improper possession of state secrets.
In a fully totalitarian state, the regime does not have rules
for most people, merely goals and desires.  If some desire is
not fulfilled, the masters will go around killing people more
or less at random until somebody fulfills that desire, or
until they have killed so many people that they suspect that
what they desire is not readily achievable, or sometimes
until they simply run out of people who might be able to
assist in fulfilling that desire.  For example all people
possessing certain skills and experience were wiped out by
Stalin, and in Cambodia everyone connected to the jute
industry in any way. Such rules as exist only apply to the
privileged, to those administering the terror, not to those
Crypto legislation is likely to resemble the announcement of a desire, rather than the announcement of rules and restrictions likely to fulfill that desire.  Indeed, the
proposals we have so far seen are desires, not rules. As you point out, that desire cannot be fulfilled, except by
means that further radically undermine the rule of law.

I assume that this is one of these anonymous source things.  According to official, yet anonymous sources the US/CIA forces committed every crime of every regime around the world, including the purported crimes of Pol Pot in Cambodia, (I kid you not) and they are actually running a totalitarian state in the USA but the people are too brainwashed to notice.  They also sell cocaine.
Similarly, according to sources that are not anonymous, but which (strange to report) no one else can find, Nike is actually producing its shoes in something very like slave labor camps.
The reason the refutation of the CNN story (US uses nerve gas to kill defectors and exterminate villagers) made such news is that CNN was so careless as to actually name identifiable real people as the source of this story. (They needed faces and it is hard to put the faces of anonymous sources on TV.) Naturally those real people were mighty pissed and denied the story attributed to them.
There is a wagon load of similar stories using supposedly official, but anonymous sources, or sources that do not appear to be real people.  The print media works much better for such sources than TV.

Simply compare the number of repeats at a jury call with the

We are not defeated.
We have won many key victories, and only one, though the
biggest one, remains to be accomplished.
Our failures have had obvious and remediable causes.
Few people use encryption technology today, because few
people have real need of it.
Few people have real need of it, because there is no
reasonably liquid net money. People are not making, spending,
transferring, and promising, money through the net, so they
have little need to encrypt their messages or care for the
reputation of their nyms.
And that is the big remaining battle.
Net money.  Net money that is reasonably liquid, that many
people acquire, that many people spend, money that is readily
convertible to worthwhile goods and services.  Don't worry
about blinding and all that.  Once any sort of net money is
flowing in large amounts, all that stuff then becomes
possible and desirable.  If there is no liquidity, nobody
cares about blinding, and if you have blinding it does you no
good anyway without liquidity.
Once we get that, we will shortly get it all.  As long as we
do not have that, we have very little.
Digicash failed because it was proprietary.  For net money to
be a success we need a standard for transferring promises to
pay that is separate from the software issuers, and thus
separate from the issuers of promises to pay or deliver.  It
has to be a standard such that anybody can play, anyone can
write software that will interoperate with software written
by others, and anyone can issue promises to deliver anything,
so that Ann, Bob, and Carol can transfer and exchange
promises between each other subject only to the need to trust
each other, without needing permissions or licenses from
anyone else.
And it has to have software that is competitive with existing
methods of transferring value.
Credit cards are very competitive for transactions of modest
size, because of the additional services, in particular
dispute arbitration and resolution provided by the card
issuers, and because of their large installed base. Smaller
players cannot hope to compete in that area.
We have however no adequate means for small payments, five
dollars to fractions of a cent. This offers a fertile
opportunity for the development of netmoney.
We also have no entirely satisfactory means for large low
margin payments..
The large payment problem could be addressed by some system
that provided a tight connection between internet money and
US dollars in US banks, or, better, a system that provided a
tight connection between internet money and US dollars in non
US banks, or, if we had a large and liquid micropayment
system, it could be provided by a tight connection between
micro and macropayments.
If several banks in some moderately popular banking haven
allowed people to transfer funds instantly and cheaply from
one account to another within the haven, through digitally
signed messages passing through https protocol, this would
make it possible to readily solve the large payment problem
by offering the means to create a tight connection between
net dollars and offshore dollars.  If this were done then the
revolution would ensue within a few years. So far none have
been willing to do this, perhaps out of fear of reprisals,
more likely out of sheer inertia.
The offshore dollar system is probably larger and more
liquid, and is certainly considerably more free, than the
onshore dollar system, but it is inconvenient for modest payments. People use it primarily for transfers of many
thousands of dollars.  Also the connection between the
offshore dollar and the onshore dollar is weak, because it is inconvenient, slow, and costly, to transfer dollars between
the offshore and onshore banking systems.
I see no possibility that anyone will be permitted to create
a strong connection between an internet dollar and the
onshore dollar, whereas it is quite possible that someone
will get away with creating a strong connection between the
internet dollar and the offshore dollar.
Alternatively, (and perhaps more likely) a satisfactory
solution to the micropayment problem automatically brings in its train a solution to the large payment problem, since the
software must accumulate many small promises into a few large
promises, and provide means to transfer these large promises
through numerous intermediaries, thus a large volume of
micropayments will create the liquidity for macropayments.
We do not need the banks to win this one, though they would
be very handy.
Large promises to pay could acquire value not through a fast
and cheap connection to the banking system, whether onshore
of offshore, but through a fast and cheap connection to the micropayment system, resulting in an internet dollar that
derives its liquidity from the internet market, and is
coupled to the US dollar no more strongly, and no less
strongly, than the offshore dollar is coupled to the onshore
Of course for this to work, we will need a large and liquid
market for aggregated micropayments. The existing finance
systems for self publishing, dirty pictures, and gambling,
really do not work very well, so there seems an obvious and
large market for micropayments.
Jakob Nielsen, an apparently well informed internet commerce
pundit who claims familiarity with lots of market research
and has himself done lots of market research has argued that there is a large and compelling market for micropayments  "The Case for Micropayments" Jakob Nielsen:
       Some analysts say that users don't want to be
       "nickeled and dimed" while they are online. In fact,
       the problem is being dimed; not being nickeled.
       Unfortunately, some sites that currently charge for
       content do so at a level of a dollar or more per page.
       Such pricing is obviously unpleasant and will only be
       acceptable for highly  value-added content that users
       can predict in advance that they will benefit        significantly from buying. Regular articles (like this
       column) cannot be that expensive.        Long-distance telephone calls and electricity are both        metered services. Many people do feel a tension while        they are on the phone, at least while making an        international or other expensive call. At the same        time, very few people worry about powering a        lightbulb, even though doing so costs a few cents per        hour. Electricity charges mainly serve to make people        turn off the lights when they go to bed. The        difference is clearly in the level of pricing:
       less than a cent per minute and people use as much as        they need (electricity) 10 cents per minute, and        people ration their usage a little (long distance        phone calls) 40 cents per minute, and people ration        their usage a lot (international calls)  On the Web,        users should not worry about a cent per page. If a        page is not worth a cent, then you should not download        it in the first place. Even as the Web grows in        importance in the future, most people will probably        access less than 100 non-free pages per day (in June        1998, heavy users visited an average of 46 pages per        day).  Most users will have $10-$30 in monthly service        charges for Web content. One cent, or half a cent, is probably the sweet spot for
pages and dirty picture, with quarters being the sweet spot
for games and gambling.
Obviously pay pages cannot and should not be searched by
search engines, so the typical design would be a free,
searchable, index page containing lead in paragraphs and pay
links to the non free pages on the site, or a collection of
free summary pages each containing a pay link to the
corresponding non free page, or (better) both a free index
page and also a collection of free summary pages.
We want the payment system to introduce no additional delays
when we click on a link, so the index page should cause any
necessary negotiations between the browser and server so that the server is ready to accept the coins of this particular
user, so that the user can get the pay page with a single
message, a single URL containing a coin.  The server then
immediately starts downloading the page without waiting for
any further messages to complete, and simultaneously attempts
to deposit the coin.
Suppose you are browsing dirty pictures, and both you and the
server are clients of the same token issuer.  Then the token
issuer knows that you are browsing the dirty picture pages,
and knows how much money the dirty picture issuer is making.
But for the scheme to be successful, we need many token
issuers, and the means to transfer aggregated token values
between issuers, so that in general the entity that takes
your bank money and provides you with net money, and the
entity that takes the dirty pictures servers netmoney and
provides it with bank money, will be very different entities, probably in very different jurisdictions, separated by a
chain of intermediaries, who have an economic incentive to
aggregate transactions, thus obscuring individual spending
and getting.
If any creditworthy person can issue tokens, privacy is not
such a big problem, and if the aggregated values representing
large numbers of tokens are readily transferable in a large
liquid market intermediary market, it is not a problem at
all, since the dirty picture issuer and the guy looking at
the dirty pictures are likely to be anonymous to the token The IBM token scheme provides for intermediaries.  Previous
token schemes did not.  This is an important step forward.
Until now, no one has issued a micropayment scheme that had a ghost of a chance. The IBM scheme seem basically workable,
though I need to examine it further.
Micropayments have not failed.  They have not yet been tried.
We still have not seen a scheme attempted that had all the
requirements that real netmoney will need.  It is simply quite a bit of work to design these things, and to get them
deployed in a form that ordinary mortals can use.       --digsig

IBM is proposing that anyone, or many people, will be free to

previous amateurish proposals for microcash, it does support

On the contrary, it is the server end that is hard.
Token generation is trivial.  Paying for tokens and getting
paid for them is not trivial.
The problem is that we do not want to force everyone in the
universe to be the clients of a single giant issuer.  That
would bring us right back to the old problem of the
tyrannical and oppressive central bank.
Visualize the following situation.  I buy tokens from Bob,

None whatsoever.
While there is a sucker born every minute, the strategy you
describe is for the most part unlikely to be profitable.
Fortunately the most cost effective method of eliminating all
competition is that followed by Alcoa, to deliver a
satisfactory product at the cheapest possible price.
In the cocaine market a number of organizations have
attempted to employ other methods for eliminating
competition, but here in America these methods have generally
proved not only unprofitable, but also for the most part
fatal.     --digsig

No one.
In the minarchist proposal, as explained by Bastiat, already
quoted on this thread, "the collective force", aka the minimal state.
In the anarchist proposal, explained by Spooner in "Natural
Law"  and myself in
"Anarcho Capitalism, a short summary"
 anyone and everyone
decides.  Attempts to enforce unnatural law are more likely
to get one killed.
Friedman in "A positive account of property rights"
explains why enforcing the law "Whats yours is yours, and
what is mine is mine" is less likely to get you killed than
attempting to enforce the law "Whats mine is mine, whats
yours is up for grabs"     --digsig

Then your argument that free markets lead to monopoly collapses.
You cannot have monopoly (in the sense of the power to extract monopoly of
profits) except by state intervention as has been proven by experience time
and time again.
You have been unable to provide any examples of monopolies except those
created by state intervention, such as the railaways, and those existent
soley in your fevered imagination, such as the garment industry.

Jim Choate then proceeds for several hundred lines without producing a single line of evidence that these markets were monopolistic, indeed without ever giving the slightest hint as to what markets he is referring to, or naming the evil folk who supposedly monopolized them, or even telling us what
era he is talking about. If real monopolies had ever existed at any time or any place
except by state intervention, Jim would be able to provide
some concrete examples.  He has not provided any examples.
Indeed he deliberately avoids the concrete, because he knows
that if he named a particular identifiable alleged
monopolist, such as the famous Standard Oil, he would be
instantly shot down with concrete statistics about market
share, price cuts, and profit margins.     --digsig

It has been a very long time since we had an armed  conflict
between one major mafia type organization and another in the
It appears to me that they have a problem because they cannot
resolve their disputes in public, thus it is hard to tell the
difference between an oppressive mafia organization that
mistreats its clients, and a legitimate mafia organization
that protects its clients.  However the government dispute
resolution apparatus does not possess any special wisdom that
the mafia dispute resolution apparatus lacks.
By and large, mafias seem to be less evil than governments,
and perform fewer violent, oppressive, and flagrantly unjust
acts than governments, and are less prone to expensive and
destructive wars.   This probably reflects the fact that such
actions by mafia chiefs are far more likely to get the mafia
chief killed, than similar acts by governments are likely to
get the ruler killed.
One might perhaps argue that some notable mafias in the US
are worse than the US government, though I have never heard
of them asking for fifty percent of someone's income.
However clearly no mafia in the US, or indeed anywhere, has
ever been as bad as any of the more objectionable
governments.     --digsig

This is not quite as deranged as it seems.  The Masons are of
course not a conspiracy, but one of the services they provide
their members is a facility for constructing and operating
conspiracies.  As a result Masons have been big players on
all sides in most revolutions.
Conspiratorial political movements are common as weeds.  Most
of them aim at stealing nothing larger than arts grants,
fellowships, and research grants, and are often moderately
successful in this endeavor.  Some also aim at stealing
entire nations.  Most of these are not at all successful.  No
Masonic conspiracies have been successful in this, so far as
is known, and the Freemason movement would doubtless
disapprove of such excessive ambition and limitless greed.
The most famous success in stealing an entire nation was of
course Lenin's Bolshevik movement  (not a Masonic
conspiracy), where Lenin stole a bourgeois revolution by
conspiratorial means.  However since Lenin's coup bourgeois
revolutionaries have been on the alert against communist
plots, and the only other success in stealing a bourgeois
revolution from the outside was the Sandinistas in Nicaragua,
where (due to Violeta's naivete and excessive trustfulness)
they stole the revolution that Violeta Chamorro made.
The Masons, being explicitly pro bourgeoisie, would steal a
bourgeois revolution from the inside, if they ever stole a
revolution, which they do not appear to have done.  However,
being both bourgeois and pro bourgeoisie, if the masons were
to steal a bourgeois revolution, it would not be as
dramatically visible as it was when the Sandinistas stole the
Nicaraguan revolution, and I might well be unaware of it.
