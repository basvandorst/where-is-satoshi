IMHO, the relevant section of the GPL, version 2 -- assuming that this

Ah - so provide an unencrypted list for the software-challenged and

The incentive for using the encrypted list, then? Simple --
Do I need to insert the stereotype that those who can't run procmail
are probably experiencing worse delays than the above thanks to their
UUCP feed? Or is enough to use the "information*timeliness=value"
argument that's been advanced in the past to advocate encrypting
traffic *to* the list? Either way, the rhetorical advantage still lies
in the turnaround time to the list.

I would like to see greater independence from the list. With the help
of anonymous mailing and forwarding services, and with the use of a
secure machine, I may be able to read and respond to the list without
ever betraying my participation. Why announce to the world that I read
cypherpunks if I don't have to?

Your particular connectivity and the ease of reading mail on-line seem
to have conspired to make decryption (as well as offline reading and
archiving!) quite onerous. If you lack a secure, connected machine at
the office, and have no IP (or UUCP!) service at home, I think you're
at a strong disadvantage towards reading any encrypted traffic at all.
Is there no means for you to automate offline mail reading?
The user with a 300 baud modem and a VT100 terminal at home should not
expect to be practicing secure encryption. Any better-equipped user
has the hardware needed to encrypt and decrypt securely -- they just
haven't written the software.

Point taken; but if you receive unencrypted mail on a multi-user
system, you're likely deluding yourself about its security as well. I
am motivated to provide the list to anyone that wants it without
advertising your subscription (and its traffic) to your service
provider. Anonymous posting, meet anonymous subscribers.
I can think of several reasons why cypherpunks would not be the only
list for which encrypted traffic might be desired.

Perhaps this is only reflective of the Real World, where he who gets
to the scarce resources first wins. Either you put a cap on the total
resource (meaning some must starve, unless they can trade something
else of worth), or you must allow limitless expansion.
You could impose an annoyance factor on the distribution of initial
resources (a week's wait, perhaps), or on unlikely transfers (you
can't give away the resource except in exchange for some other form of
goods... an Objectivist's paradise, perhaps?)
Finally, there's always forced socialism: A high tax rate or inflation
rate should keep folks from accumulating ill-gotten wealth for long.
Without delving too deeply into the details of the simulation, isn't
the liquidity of the value of the resource a hedge against people
attempting to stockpile same through polynymity?

Strange -- the RSAREF 2.0 license asserts no such restriction, unless
I've misread it. Patching it -- say, to allow it to handle >1024 bit
keys -- would seem to fall under one's license...
[from license.txt]
     c.   to modify the Program in any manner for porting or
          performance improvement purposes (subject to Section 2)
          or to incorporate the Program into other computer programs
          for your own personal or internal use, provided that you
          provide RSA with a copy of any such modification or
          Application Program by electronic mail, and grant RSA a
          perpetual, royalty-free license to use and distribute such
          modifications and Application Programs on the terms set
          forth in this Agreement.
Is the definition of "performance improvement" so limited that
improving maximum key size is not permitted?
This aside, modifying RSAREF 2.0 (and taking out the guardrails in
keymgmt.c) *appears* to allow larger key sizes. The only succeeding
restriction on key sizes is the 1280-bit restriction imposed by the
assembly code, if the comments are to be believed.
Generating a brand new ~1280 bit key under 2.5 appears to work
perfectly, although I suppose RSAREF could be happily returning a
shorter key that claims to be >1024 bits (either by design, or by
omission). The fact that an older >1024 bit key fails this test does
raise this suspicion.
This will take some further work. I would be surprised to discover
that the MIT folk hadn't fiddled with this at all, though -- Any

No sooner said... Ahem. The patches to both PGP 2.5 and RSAREF 2.0 are
both obscenely trivial, actually, with the exception of the bug fix (!)
to idea.c, which was obtained mere minutes after my bug report
courtesy of jis himself.
Should elegance be demanded, crypto.c and language.txt should both be
patched to mention the new upper limit. With MAX_RSA_MODULUS_BITS out
of the way, MAX_BIT_PRECISION is the next hard upper limit, defined as
1280 bits. There isn't any glaring reason not to increase that
constant as well... However, my goal for the nonce was to grandfather
old 1024+ keys.  I don't see much point nowadays in generating a new
key that a thousand other "stock" PGP users won't be able to utilize.
In accordance with the terms of the RSAREF 2.0 license agreement, I am

they may have a perpetual, royalty-free license to the three bytes I
changed :-)

Well, gee, perhaps the commercialization of the Ext list is as much

Since it's traditional to push the analogy to ridicule: I'd be more

I have yet to see a date, but Digicash states several times in their
press releases that Cyberbucks are only a trial currency, and that at
some point in the future the trial will come to an end.
Will the bottom drop out of the c$ market at that point? Without
Digicash to authenticate currency, it would appear to be impossible to
trade c$ coins. If and when Digicash announces an end date for the
trial, I would expect to see quite a spectacular crash in the "real
cash for ecash" market.
The only way to preserve the market would appear to be providing an
ecash-for-ecash exchange with a new bank, presumably a licensee of the
Digicash software. Such a bank could, out of little more than good
will and a desire to kick-start a new e-currency, offer to exchange c$
for the new ecash. Or, perhaps we just shrug our shoulders, kiss our
hardly-earned Cyberbuck goodbye, and mumble about how it was fun while
it lasted.
Either way, in order to preserve the new e-currency's value -- and
correct my economics where flawed -- we need the assurance that the
money supply will not experience unreasonable growth. The ecash trial
has Digicash's promise of a c$1M cap; is this trust sufficient
leverage for the user to leave any amount of value in the Cyberbuck,
or its successor?

It may be that the approach is off anyway. Credit cards have only
signature verification -- if the salesperson bothers -- because stolen
cards are reported. You don't need a strong authentication technique
if a stolen card is easy to cancel.
Of course, perhaps this encourages someone to steal your card and
incapacitate you before you can report it. That's why we have
PINs... so that someone can steal your card, threaten you until you
reveal your PIN, and then incapacitate you... Hmm...
Even with a weak PIN system for authentication, you can always provide
a "duress" PIN, right?

Er, um, right.
Well, then, perhaps on-line systems need to consider cash
revocation in case of theft. Actually, this is a no-brainer: just
exchange the cash for some new coin, and the old stuff goes
invalid. Admittedly, this means a footrace for the mugger and the
victim, so I guess the mugger is encouraged to knock you out cold.
Maybe you just shouldn't carry too much cash with you. Gee, that
sounds like good advice even without digital protocols.

Duress PINs liberally sprinkled through the keyspace also drop the

@_subject: DalSemi: Add-Only Memory for Storage of Digital Cash 
A press release breezed through the list a while back about some
"decoder rings" -- basically, a nonvolatile RAM chip embedded in a
Jostens ring.
On further inspection, it looks to be a superior product to the
DataKey products I remember seeing about ten years ago, targeted at
this same sort of niche. The part in question is much smaller -- it
fits in a ring, after all, or on the usual sorts of key fobs and
employee badges -- and establishing electrical contact to transceive
data is trivial.
Cypherpunks relevance? Twofold. One, the Touch MultiKey
(ftp://ftp.dalsemi.com/pub/datasheets/1991.ps), which promises to hold
three 384 bit blocks under 64-bit passwords. The device will transmit
the stored data under the correct password, and "random bits" under
all other passwords. No crypto here, though, just a simple on-chip
comparison with a stored password. So I assume the determined opponent
with physical access can extract the info; but better that than store
your private key on a publically accessible machine, no?
Secondly, an app note: "Use of Add-Only Memory for Secure Storage of
Monetary Equivalent Data" (ftp://ftp.dalsemi.com/pub/datasheets/app84.ps).
A creative idea based on the peculiar nature of the EPROMs* that are
also available in this form factor. In particular, one bits may be
burned to zeros, but not vice versa; so why not burn particular bits
to indicate credits and debits?
Knowing that this scheme depends on keeping an attacker from guessing
which bits to burn, they use the unique serial number to uniquely
permute the bits, so that an attacker is as likely to burn a "debit"
bit as a "credit", and far likelier to burn out-of-sequence so that
the monkey business is apparent to any vendor.
And there's another item of note: each chip has a unique, etched,
machine-readable serial number. What are the bets that Dallas
Semiconductor can tell you who purchased that chip? Well, so much for
an anonymous payment scheme based on *this* product.
Still, if I had to choose a place to keep a secret key, I'd choose my
knuckle over my key ring, let alone a floppy disk, PDA, or portable
* Gee, back in my day EPROMs were Eraseable; these folks mean instead
  to indicate an Electrically Programmable chip, which sounds like a
  good old PROM to me. Ahhh, acronyms...

You might want to take a look at the paper I mentioned, then: I
believe that irradiation of the OTP EPROM to return all bits to "ones"
is too blunt a tool to do you any good. A virgin EPROM has a value of
zero in the suggested scheme. And, as mentioned, flipping random sets
of bits is strongly likely to get you caught.
Note also that the encoding is strongly tied to the laser-etched serial
number on the chip, so replay attacks between two different chips --
i.e. copying a fully loaded chip to a virgin chip -- won't work.
However, it does open up the scheme to replay attacks, if you can load
the chip with value, spend it, irradiate it, and then successfully
reprogram the chip with the exact same values you recorded.
Good point.
I seem to remember PROMs actually undergoing physical, rather than
electrical, state changes (that were presumably nonreversible). Am I
recalling old technology, or am I just plain mistaken?

I intend to donate mine to a local library. I'd like to think that
some bright high schooler, or junior high schooler even, might get the
crypto bug a little earlier than I did.
I'll try to persuade them to leave a copy of the errata stapled to the
inside back cover.  Heck, if you have the cash flow*, donate a 2nd
edition instead.

Unfortunately, the technology's appearance is distinctly angled toward
the anti-hero. One, because the benefits are more obvious to the
anti-hero; and two, because the abuse of technology gets better press
than its use, particularly in the get-tough-on-crime era.

I've read only fictional accounts about the 3-person cell. Any
pointers to nonfiction material? "Tradecraft" didn't seem to be the
magic keyword in the local card catalog.
