True.  I think it depends on what your intended purpose is for using a
remailer.  If you just want to post an anonymous message, faster would
be better for sake of keeping with the conversation.  If you really want
to communicate securely, you can use remailers such as
elee9sf which batches messages out at midnite and adds
random padding, or remail which offers encryption
and adds a random delay.

Is it really a good idea to make anonymous remailers work so fast?
Everyone who can analyze the traffic of anonymous remailers and
can read the from/to header lines, the message size and the transfer dates immediately knows who sent mail to whom. The make the remailers more safe, I would suggest to modify the
Every message must be sliced into pieces of standardized size
( e.g. 8K or 500 lines ). It should be possible to send the
pieces over different channels. Every server should collect pieces and keep them a random time. Perhaps they could be
collected until 10MByte of pieces are collected and then they
can be sent out all. Every piece could contain a time limit
which may not be exceeded by the servers. Higher limit means
more confusion for a spy trying to follow this packet. The
packets should be recyphered by every hop. They could have
a random tail who's length is changed by a hop. A traffic
spy could not find out which input and which output packets

Our secret weapon against Nazis in the USA is that we don't censor them.
 We let them publish their books so everyone can see how stupid and
ridiculous nazism is.  We also have books about what the Nazis did to
the jews in WWII.
The reason the Nazis are such a problem in Germany is that the
government gives them so much free advertizing.  The whole thing about
how a secret BBS network eludes the police makes people very interested
in it.  People like the idea of belonging to a special elite
orginaztion, and its "underground" status gives it that appeal.  There
are Nazi BBS systems in the USA, and they're not too difficult to find. And most people couldn't care less.
But to make a relevant comparison to cypherpunks: How many people used
PGP before the clipper debate began?  (Fairly few)  How many heard about
it because of the recent public uproar caused by the government wanting
to control crypto?  If clipper had never been introduced, many people
who now use PGP would never have heard of it.  The government created
its own encryption "problem" by telling people about it.  The Germans
are creating their own Nazi problem by telling people about it.  Food
for thought...

Of course not without *any* interaction. You have to pay taxes if
you earn money, and you are not allowed to do it anonymous. Everything must contain
an address of someone responsible. In bigger papers you have
an "impressum" in small papers and pamphlets you have
a line like "responsible in the sense of press law: Joe Dalton"
And of course you will get sued or accused if you write anything
which violates law, but this depends on _what_ you are writing.
But no one forbids to do produce a newspaper. Every school has
a 'schoolpaper' (don't know how to translate well). Everyone
who thinks he has to tell anything important prints anything
on lots of paper at this University, in most cases political
(often very left-wing) themes. Our 'Grundgesetz', the constitution (like "Bill of rights") says
that there is no censorship. Everyone can tell his opinion
in "Word, letter and image":
Art. 5
(1) Jeder hat das Recht, seine Meinung in Wort, Schrift und Bild frei
zu uern und zu verbreiten und sich aus allgemein zugnglichen
Quellen ungehindert zu unterrichten. Die Pressefreiheit und die
Freiheit der Berichterstattung durch Rundfunk und Film werden

(2) Diese Rechte finden ihre Schranken in den Vorschriften der
allgemeinen Gesetze, den gesetzlichen Bestimmungen zum Schutze der

(3) Kunst und Wissenschaft, Forschung und Lehre sind frei. Die

What do you want to hear?
If I say yes, then you call the german Nazis. If I say no, then we have no press freedom in your eyes.
Give us a chance to have 'press freedom' *and* to protect us
against Nazis.
Don't mix this! Whether *everyone* has the right to produce a newspaper and
whether you can print *everything* into a newspaper, are two different
things. Can we allow to print everything into a newspaper? No, not
everything. And I think, the law is well choosen. The important detail
is, that you are not forbidden to print a newspaper before, but they
can be after you *after* you have print anything bad. For example you are not allowed to call for hating other races,
but this is not special for the press. This is everywhere.
The limits for the press are low and they forbid themes only
which are *real* criminal [at least in my oppinion].
Look at the mailbox system used by neo-nazis. We can't allow
this. But if we take them their mailboxes away, everyone says
"The Germans don't even allow computers". You can't have both.
In the last months they found nazi-newspapers with exact descriptions
of how to build bombs and lists of people to be killed for speaking
against nazis. You do not expect us to accept this, do you?
The restrictions against such things are not a law against the press. It is forbidden, independend whether it comes in a newspaper
or whereever else.
Again, I feel beeing pressed to an answer which will be wrong, whatever
I answer.
Spoken well, but far away from reality. If you see 100 Nazis and 10.000 people. The 10.000 don't have a job,
don't have money, don't know what to do and are not the intellectual
elite. They have a lot of problems and don't know where the problems
came from and how to solve them. Now come 100 Nazis and tell them,
everything were the fault of ugly, stupid foreigner, which steal
their jobs, rape their women and are bad by nature, they should be
killed or thrown out. Now you see, that a lot of these 10.000 are going to believe this.
Many of them come from the German Democratic Republic and they learned
to believe everything anyone tells them. Other just want to beat anyone.
Do you want to do nothing and let them continue until it is too late?
Didn't we have this before?
No, then it is too late. When building are burning, people die. Some turkish people died because their house was set on fire. You can't
bring them back.
Can't you remember what Americans told about the Germans when the
two american sportsmen were beaten some months ago?
A free society must be able to defend. If the target of the
communication is to stop the society beeing free, a free society
can't accept this. A free society must be free to *stay* free.

I wish it were true. They were trying this for many years. We all thought

If you can get them...
Untrue. In Germany, I can do the very same. And I do not get

depends on what you understand under "Nazi".
In this discussion "Nazi" is everything from an idea to settings buildings
on fire. If I say allow, they say I would allow killing people. If I forbid,
they say I forbid to publish ideas. Tell me what is "Nazi" in your argument.
Untrue. A press without freedom can't be good. And if your press is bad
and not interested in publishing anything real, then of course you don't
need to control it. But this is neither freedom nor quality.

Exactly the same as in Germany! Many people do this! We printed papers
at the school, we print papers at the university, we do it everywhere.
Print anything with your computer, go to the next copy-machine. Print
as much as you can pay and carry and give it to everyone you want. It
happens nearly every day. When I began to study at this university I
got my half bag full of papers in the mensa every day. Meanwhile they
are printing less because noone reads them all, you can't read them
all, they are too many. At the first day at this university I got
invitations from two groups of homosexual groups, one invitiation of
the lesbians group, about 20 invitations of political groups and
a lot of paper I didn't even look at. What is the use of press freedom if the press doesn't use it?

Hi everyone,
we have to stop this discussion.  I have more than 20 mails in my mailbox, everyone
very long, serious, interesting and waiting for response.
But I can't answer them all within reasonable time, I also
have to do my regular work.
Furthermore I have a lot of mails of people asking me to
stop this discussion "between two persons". Some don't see
that it has anything to do with cryptography. I don't share this oppinion, because if we talk about
communication, we also have to talk about the danger and
the restriction of communication. The german right-/left-wing
as well as the american Mafia are known to use modern
computer networks, cryptographical software and methods
of system security and access control. We can not close
the eyes and just don't care about what is done with the
tools we are contructing. Meanwhile I can somehow understand that there has to be
any form of export restriction if people constructing
such tools have so many problems with thinking about
possible forms of bad use of their tools.
And again I got confirmed what we find so often in so many cases: People love to talk and form a judgement
of Germany and don't even really know what they are talking
about. This is a never-ending problem of Germany. In this special case of Naziism you should be aware that
they found not only germany nazi computer networks. They found this network to be the international connection
to other country's nazis, especially Austria, Great
Britain and USA. Two of the german politicians asked
to forbid private mailbox systems and even modems.
Of course this is stupid, but perhaps your politicians
get the same idea. When I read the clipper proposals I
think they already had such an idea.

There is no restriction of import or use of cryptography ( _yet_ ). There are some restrictions about export and transmission of encrypted data:
- Encryption soft/hardware can not be exported to communist countries
  (COCOM) without problems. I don't know exactly, whether it is
  forbidden, must be licensed, or must be registered in any way.
- There are two kinds of amateur radio, the CB (citizen band) and the
  licensed amateur radio, which requires a personal license. On this
  licensed radio it is not allowed to send encrypted messages, but as
  far as I know nobody cares and nobody checks. The sense was to make
  you use the telephone and pay.
- There was a restriction about the telephone net. You are not allowed
  to transmit anything but voice. I don't know what happened with that
  restriction since everyone uses fax and modem legally. At the moment they have a lot of problems with such laws. They have to
decide whether they are valid or not, because most european countries
have joined the European Community. The EC forces their countries to
equalize their laws in the sense of "what you can do in one country,
you can do everywhere".
Sometimes this is very helpfull (e.g. use of modems. Most of them
where illegal in Germany, meanwhile nearly all of them have a
license), sometimes they have silly ideas (e.g. laws about ingredients
of noodles or beer). If France forbids the import of crypto software, but allows to sell it
inside of France, then I can sue France, because the french programmer
can sell his programs in France and I can't.

@_subject: PGP key checking 
I just signed and checked some pgp keys (using pgp 2.6.1) and I found
something unexpected:
Keys can be checked with the -kc option. To identify the key to be checked
either a string or the KeyID (with 0x-prefix) can be given as an argument.
If I do now pgp -kc name_of_anyone pgp -kc 0xanyones_key_id
for the very same key (once identified by substring, once by keyid,
which should both do the same job)
the first command checks many more signatures than the second command.
The second command stops earlier, but I couldn't find out yet, whether
this stops after finding a trusted path to the checked key or what else could
be the reason for this.
Any ideas?

No. It is a simple thing to find a turn which fits to a given state of the cube. When the cube came out a german newspaper
published a simple method for solving the cube. This means everyone
can easily find a "message" which fits to a given "hash value". This must
not be possible for a cryptographic hash function. The hash-function
must be a one-way function, but the cube isn't one-way.
Further more, the cube allows some kind of differential analysis.
Since turning the front side only affects the front side, you can
see what to do to turn the front side back. That's also not good
for cryptographic context.
It is still a problem to convince experts that a hash function is a one-way function...

@_subject: Are 2048-bit pgp keys really secure ? 
A 2048-bit pgp key ( n=p*q somewhere around 2^2048,
p and q somewhere around 2^1024) is only as secure as it looks
like, if both p and q are prime numbers. In fact p and q are only pseudo prime numbers, they are not proven to
be prime numbers. It is known only that they have a high probability
to be prime numbers. Usually a candidate number is send through a probabilistic prime test
which says either "No, not a prime" or "a prime with a probability of
at least 50% ". Usually this test is repeated 10 or 20 times, so after
passing this iteration the probability of having a prime number is at
least 1:2^10 or 1:2^20 . Would such a test be sufficient for generating 1024-bit prime numbers?
Does it make sense to use pseudo-prime-numbers with a low probability of
1:2^10 only to generate a rsa key with a 2048 bit n ?
Now have a look at pgp2.6.2:
In genprime.c the prime numbers are generated. After testing the
candidates with a table of small primes, they are passed to
slowtest(). [Read slowtest and its comment...]
slowtest() does not do one of the usual primality tests. It just passes
the candidate through a Fermat test. Only four (4!) passes are done.
The comment of slowtest() gives a probability of 10^-44 to fail for a number of about 512 bit. If this is true ( 10^-44  ~  2^-146 ), about
one of 10^44 keys is weak. This shouldn't be a problem, 10^44 is quite
But at the moment I can't follow the arguments, why 4 Fermat tests
should be enough to find good (pseudo-)primes. I can't see a reason
why the iteration should already be stopped after the 4th
loop. Generating a key should be worth to wait some minutes longer,
especially when this doesn't need interactive work. I am also not
convinced yet of the Fermat test. Why not use a Rabin-Miller-Test ?
I have read only a very small piece of the pgp code yet, but if I
understand the code of slowtest well (correct me if not...) the
command mp_init(x, primetable[i]) for i=0,1,2,3 sets mpi x to
the values 2,3,5,7 . If I understood this well, the slowtest() is
nothing more than testing for a given p whether  2^(p-1)  = 1  mod p
 3^(p-1)  = 1  mod p
 5^(p-1)  = 1  mod p
 7^(p-1)  = 1  mod p
Any comments?
BTW: The comment of slowtest() references "Finding Four Million Large
Random Primes", by Ronald Rivest, in Advancess in Cryptology:
Proceedings of Crypto '91.
I have the "Advances in Cryptology - Crypto '91, Proceedings", Lecture
Notes in Computer Science, 576, Springer, here. Call me blind or

where to find the referenced Article ?

BTW 2: pgp2.6.2 doesn't work well if a key identified by its keyid is
keychecked ( pgp -kc 0x... ). It stops after the first signature
with a signators key shorter than the signed/checked key, because the
global precision is changed and not changed back for testing the
signature.

Does anyone know how many Carmichael-Numbers exist?
A Carmichael-Number m is a number where
foreach a : gcd(a,m)=1  =>    a^(m-1) = 1 mod m
e.g. 561 = 3*11*17
If you found a Carmichael-Number consisting of primes bigger than
the primes in your small-numbers-sieve, the Fermat-test won't detect
it as a non-prime. Since Carmichael-Numbers have at least three prime factors, a 2048-bit n would consist of one ~1024-prime and at least
three other primes. At least one of them would be smaller than ~340 bit, probably significant smaller.

So why not do a cheap trick:
After the small primes check calculate a CRC checksum over the number.
Then do the primality check. If it is a prime, store it together with
the CRC. The CRC can be checked for every use of the number.
(PGP encrypts the secret key and therefore it generates a CRC for the
encrypted packet. But this CRC is generate after the primality check.)
We already had some SIMM modules with bit errors. They were detected by
a parity check. If cheap pc simms don't have a real parity bit, the probability
of having such a bug isn't as low as 10^-40. If cheap parity-less simms
are available they get sold (cheap and expensive). BTW: Some weeks ago they found motherbords with falsified cache rams:
They had just the normal DIL-ICs and the normal pins, but the plastic of
the ICs didn't contain a chip. The BIOS was modified to give out a message

You can get the square root mod p (p prime) easily, if p+1 is divisible by 4.
You (should) know that  x ^ (p-1) equals to 1 mod p for every given x > 0.
Therefore  x ^ ( (p-1)/2 ) is either +1 or -1  mod p.
Now you have a given  x^2 and want to find x (one of both, there are two..)
 ( x^2 ) ^ ((p+1)/4)  =   x ^ (  (p+1)/2 )  =  x * x ^( (p-1)/2 ) = +/- x .
If p+1 is not divisible by 4, it's a little bit more difficult...
In your example, 35+1 is luckily divisible by 4.  But this doesn't help,
because 35 is not a prime.  35 = 5*7 , you can use the chinese remainder and
find the root mod 5 and the root mod 7. 7+1 is divisible by 4, you can use the trick:
( 8 ^ 2 ) ^ 2 mod 7 =  +/- 1.   (which is correct since 8 = 1 mod 7);
     +1 and -1 are the roots of (8^2) modulo 7.
Modulo 5 we can't use the trick, but we guess the roots of (8^2) = 4 mod 5 as
  2 and 3.
Back to the main problem: You want to have the root of (8^2) mod 35. We found the roots  1 and 6 as roots of  (8^2) mod 7
and      the roots  2 and 3 as roots of  (8^2) mod 5.
Now solve the Chinese remainder for each possible pair (1,2), (1,3), (6,2), (6,3),
and you get the _four_ roots of (8^2) mod 35. Two of them will be 8 and -8, and there
are another two.

gone. Their new task is the industrial espionage. The russian, french,
and american services were referenced in the article.
It was said that Pres. Clinton had given a speech while visiting the
CIA HQ in Langley/Virginia. He allegedly said in this speech that obtaining
industrial informations has the highest priority and this were the new
task for the spies.
Can anyone confirm the quotation?

We have a similar story in Germany. Some time ago, an asian country
(South Korea if I remember well) was looking for a high speed
passenger train. They had to choose between the german ICE and the
french TGV. Both trains  have nearly the same quality from technical
point of view. Korea decided to take the cheaper one. The germans gave an offer and just half an hour later the french gave
an offer slightly (just a little bit) cheaper than the germans. France
got the order (over 10^9 D-Mark). The german headquarter had
instructed their asian office to give the offer with a certain price
through unprotected fax. It is said that the fax was wiretapped by the
french secret service (allegedly)...

To do a proof I rewrite the algorithm:
n = len(modulus)                   // modulus < B^n
Y = X                              // obviously Y = X mod modulus
K =  B ^ (n+1) - U                 // U = B ^ (n+1) mod modulus,
                                   // therefore K = 0 mod modulus
for (i=len(Y)-1 ; i>n  ;  i--)
 {
   F = B ^ (i-n-1) * K             // F > 0
                                   // F = 0 mod modulus
   Y -=  Y[i] * F                  // Y shrinking, but
                                   // Y still the same mod modulus
   if ( Y >= B^i )
      Y -= F                       // again shrinking,
                                   // still the same mod modulus
 }
This shows that Y was shrinking, but is still equal to X mod modulus.
To see whether Y really shrinks enough:
  Y = sum(i=0..len(Y)-1)  Y[i] * B^i
In the step Y = Y - Y[i] * B^i the highest block of Y is deleted (what
could be done fast by reducing the length of Y).   Now  Y < B^i
Afterwards the same value mod modulus is added to keep Y constant:   Y = Y + Y[i] * U * B^(i-n-1).
  Y[i]  Y[i]+1  <= B
  U < modulus < B^n , therefore U < B^n
  ->    (Y[i]+1) * U < B * B^n  = B^(n+1)
  ->    Y[i] * U  < B^(n+1) - U
  ->    Y[i] * U *  B^ (i-n-1 )  < F
  Therefore after doing the addition
    Y < B^i + F
  Check of the last step:
  0 <= U < B^n therefore   B^n  <  B^(n+1) - U  <= B^(n+1)
  Therefore in every loop
  B^(i-1) < F <= B^i
  ->   Y-F  < B^i
Partial Correctness:
Y = X                              [ Y = X mod                                      Y < B^len(X) ]
K =  B ^ (n+1) - U                 [ K = 0 mod

        [ Y = X mod  ,  Y < B^(i+1) ]
   F = B ^ (i-n-1) * K         [ F = 0 mod  ,   B^(i-1) < F <= B^i  ]
        [ 0 <= Y[i] < B ]

      [ Y = X mod ,
        Y >= 0    ,
        Y < B^i ]
 }
Last i was n+1, therefore
  Y = X mod ,  Y >= 0 , Y < B^(n+1)
This is not enough,  Y < B^n is requested. The loop can't be done once
more because i-n-1 would become negative.
k+1 was the length of X, and  n the length of the modulus. You walk
down from k to n+1 . In every loop you remove one block of the
number. This means you have to do len(X)-len(modulus) loops. In the
pseudocode you do only len(X)-len(modulus)-1 loops.
One loop seems to be missing. This may be a
result of confusion whether your Y starts with Y[0] or Y[1]. I do understand the algorithm as:
n = len(modulus)
U = B^n  mod modulus
K = B^n - U                         // = 0 mod modulus,  0 < K < B^n
Y = X
for(i=len(X)-1 ; i>= n ; i--)       // squeeze Block i in Number Y
 {                                  // Y < B ^ (i+1)
   F = B ^ ( i-n )  * K             // F = 0 mod modulus
   Y -= Y[i] * F                    // subtract  Y[i] * B^i, now Y < B ^ i
                                    // add the equivalent Y[i] * B^(i-n)*U <= F
                                    // now Y < B^i + F
   if ( Y >= B[i] )
     Y -= F                         // now Y < B^i
 }
Last i was n, therefore Y < B^n , Y = X mod modulus , but perhaps still Y >= modulus.
Ok, algorithm understood and agreed (after modifying the loop counter).

That's the same problem as with the cave: Why not just go into the left

Both are absolute proofs. If you have two identical bills you must be able
to copy them.
In a cryptographical proof there is always the chance to guess. The chance
is sometimes 50%, sometimes very small.
What about this idea:
Alice is caught in a dark room somewhere on the world. She doesn't know
where she is, but there is a telephone in the room and she calls Bob to
ask him where she is. Bob claims to know it but doesn't want to reveal. He calls her back. When the phone is ringing, he has proven the knowledge
of her phone number, but she still doesn't know where she is or how he
could know. And there is still the chance that Bob has guessed the number.

@_subject: Re: Certificate proposal 
I was busy in the last days and didn't keep track of the certificate
discussion. I just read most of the discussion all at once. - There was some discussion about the bindings between the key and the
  real world attributes of the key owner.
  Under normal circumstances communication never happens without an
  originator. If the originator uses some kind of security feature, he
  normally doesn't do it just for fun. He uses it as a tool to give
  the communication certain properties.
  Authenticity and confidentiality don't make sense without knowing
  anything about the key owners. There is no use in having a signature
  as long as you don't know anything about the signator. And there is
  no use in encrypting messages as long as you don't know anything
  about the receiver.   A digital signature is only the way to say who wrote the
  message. "Knowing the author" is the sense of the signature, not just
  having the signature. "Knowing" means know enough attributes about
  him. Same with encryption.
  Knowledge of the author may, of course, be quite bizarre, as well as
  the author itself. But security is always in context of some
  knowledge about the other side.   It doesn't make much sense to communicate with a
  "smith because this is not enough information to get
  sufficient knowledge of the key owner. There are a lot of people
  named smith being able to legally have this address. And it doesn't
  make sense to communicate with Bob, "Bob" or ISP+Bob, as long as the
  name Bob is not sufficient to provide enough information.
  I need to be able to get any knowledge about the key owner that
  could be a reason to be interested in communicating with him. I
  do not want to talk with bob because he is one of many Bobs. I want
  to talk with him because he is the Bob with phone number 123, red
  hair and living in XY street.   Therefore, a certificate must be able to provide any information
  that could be required for the decision whether the key owner will
  be accepted as a communication partner.
  Obviously, the informations depend on the nature of the key owner
  (human, machine, committee etc.)
- Under normal circumstances communication has an originator and
  in most cases an addressee. If you can talk to an addressee, you usually
  have some kind of address to locate him. But perhaps you don't have
  more than the address, not even a public key. Thus the address to
  communicate should also be good to locate the public key of the
  addressee (or the keys of all key owners listening on that address).
  Therefore, the communication address should be enough to locate a
  key server and to retrieve the key (or a small number of possible
  keys) for that address. After retrieving the keys, the originator of
  communication can decide whether there is a key sufficiently
  identifying his communication partner.
  Consequently, the key certificate should contain the communication
  address of the owner. It is helpfull if the address is unique.
  For a human this may be the email address. For a machine it may be
  the DNS host name or the internet adress. For a service (WWW-site)
  or an organization it may be the email address.
  The communication address must allow to locate the key server. The
  only existing infrastructure allowing this in internet is the
  DNS. If you have an email address, hostname or IP address, you can
  find the appropriate DNS server. The server should be able to help
  you. Best way to do this is to provide the address of a key
  retrieval system (similar to the MX record).
  Use the communication address of the key owner as a searchable index
  for the key.
  Inventing a MD5 hash sum as key index is useless and doesn't make
  sense in my eyes. It just creates the problem of knowing the index
  and typo errors.
- A MITM between two communication partners can be avoided by
  apropriate protocols as long as there is a sufficient key management
  structure.
- A MITM between a key owner and the certification authority is a
  problem, but a solvable one.
  I don't like the separation of creating the key and attaching
  attributes. The MITM can attack between. There is always the
  problem of managing all attached attributes. When the first
  attribute is attached to the key, the key doesn't have any other
  attributes. This make it vulnerable.
  It is better to combine the key and its attributes _before_ creation of the
  key. If the attributes are not attached, but an essential part of
  the key, there is no hole for the MITM. If key and certification are
  two things, there is the problem of bringing them
  together. Self-certified keys don't have this problem. (RFC 1824)
- There is also question whether the key attributes can be trusted to
  describe the real key owner well enough. This implies that someone
  must check the attributes and participate in attaching the attribute
  or creating the self-certified key. PGP uses key signatures to do
  so, but there is not much information attached, just
  name/e-mail-address.   As said before there might be interest in describing the key owner
  in other ways. The authority signing the key must be able to check
  the description of the key owner. An unorganized web of trust (trust
  in what? signator knows key owner?) isn't suitable. One reason is
  that there is much too much overhead in finding a path of trust in
  the web and storing or retrieving the keys while searching for the
  path.
  There must be a systematic, hierarchical organization of authorities
  which check the key attributes. (We call them SKIA : Secure Key
  Issuing Authority, see RFC 1824).
So I would suggest the following:
We create a hierarchy of SKIAs able to check certain
attributes. E.g. hostnames and IP addresses might be checked by the
same authorities which allow to use them. Key attributes are a composition of the communication addresses of the
key owner and his natural attributes a communication partner might be
interested in while identifying the peer. Key owner and SKIA create a combination of key and attributes.
The key owner deposits his key on all key servers responsible for his
comm. addresses.
If you communicate with someone known at least by his communication
address (otherwise you couldn't communicate), you can easily retrieve
all possible public keys of all key owners able to use this
address. Now you can decide and choose the key with appropriate
attributes (bank account number or whatever).
