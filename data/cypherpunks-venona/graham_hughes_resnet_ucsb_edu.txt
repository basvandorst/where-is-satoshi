It's unclear how lucifer could do this without limiting legit traffic
and destroying the usefulness of the remailer.  Filtering by mail
addresses is immoral for such a remailer, as is examination of the
source text.
Better to address this server side, in the list itself, but that
requires moderators and a lot of time and effort.  The result is often
worth it.  Even better than that is to simply ignore the loser.

No.  ITAR restricts key *size*, not keyspace.  A substitution cypher
has a key size of 2**4 <= 26 <= 2**5, you're not going to get the

You can't count up human lives and say ``this entity is more evil than

Better than being the one to bring it up in the first place.  Really, is a crypto list an appropriate place for that sort of tripe, any more than it is for this?
I do believe that there are varying degrees of evil, yes.  I do not believe they can be differentiated by counting bodies.
I remarked `usually', because of a practical bend; the Rhwandans certainly don't deserve their lot, but there are others who well deserve premature termination in one form or another; Dahmer comes to mind.  From time to time, I thought that things would be better off if I were to simply die.
Put another way, the situation in Rhwanda distorts the usual life-and-death cycle, by killing indiscriminately people who should live much longer.  Dahmer, a man who lived in death, could hardly come to a more appropriate end.
As I look back on that paragraph, I do acknoledge it was poorly worded, and I apologize for the difficulties.  No one, not even Dahmer deserves the hardships Rhwandans (to pick a convenient example) are going through.
I just don't think it's appropriate to center a long flame about.  Does it not cause you, too, anguish to see such a situation fought over like a dog bone?
