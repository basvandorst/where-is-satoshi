@_subject: TidBITS article on Netscape 
Geoff Duncan has written an article about the Netscape security
breach in TidBITS, an e-zine for Mac owners. Copies are available
at: The above version is formatted using Setext. HTML and text/plain
versions are also available. Mr. Young? Perhaps this could go into
the library?
Seems fair, if critical, and c2.org gets a mention.
