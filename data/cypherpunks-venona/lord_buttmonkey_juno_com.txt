I have a few questions for everyone.
1.) Can this be compiled with the -DUSA option (the equivalent for Win95)
so it is usable in the USA?
2.) What language is it written in?
3.) Can it be compiled with Borland C++ 4.0?
4.) Does it have a convienient project file?

Umm, no, freedom doesn't work like that.  If you open a *private*
establishment, you have the right, according to the constitution, to deny
*anyone* the right to enter or eat in your restraunt.  However, if you
were banned from using the government postal service for being Jewish,
then yes, you are being oppressed.
Depends.  Does it affect your neighbors?  If so, then no.  If not, then
Tough shit.
If you don't like your job, no one's forcing you to stay.  Just leave it
and get another one.

Apologies.  In *theory* you have those rights, on *paper*, you have those
rights, but in *practice*, you're correct, the Government has power that
it gleefully abuses, forcing others to comply w/ political correctness.
I'd like some more info on this Denny's thing.

No, we wouldn't.  If we had to resort to physical violence against a
government, than it needs it, you shouldn't need to do that if the
Constitution is in effect.  Otherwise...
Because holding up a PGP disk will not save your life if a
robber/looter/IRS Agent breaks into your house.

Erm, no.
Some businesses put out shoddy encryption products, regardless.

On the note of filters:
Why are Netscape Communicator's filters nonworking?  I couldn't get them
to work, *ever*.
