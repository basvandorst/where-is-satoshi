I'm well advanced with a Windows Pre-Mailer for use with Nymservers. The project was inspired by a very serious emotional support group I'm in. It's LISTSERV based and doesn't mix well with anon.penet.fi. Nymservers would be excellent for such purposes if they were easy to use. Hence this I certainly don't want to create a Spammers tool. Right mow, I have put in space for managing up to 10 Nyms. I chose 10 because I thought it was more than anyone would want....
