I hope Tim McVeigh frys. His friend Terry too.

he has been convicted on the 11 (I believe) federal employees.  He has yet
be tried on the other 156. I believe that the state of Oklahoma is going to
prosecute that case.  The 11 deaths should be enough though, for the
maximum penalty.

I do not question McVeighs guilt. I do question that it was a solo act. I
am also not convinced it wasn't a government sting operation gone bad.
oh well, not quite as good, but it works none the less. Anyone know the url
to the "means of execution" list?
