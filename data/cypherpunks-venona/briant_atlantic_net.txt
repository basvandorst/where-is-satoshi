@_subject: Re: [off-topic] roving wiretaps 
It is my understanding that police need a warrant to tap *cellular* phones, but not *wireless* phones.
One should understand that monitoring cellular traffic is *much* more difficult than tapping a conventional phone, because as the user moves around in the service area the phone switches to different repeaters, often several times during a conversation.
I am curious as to the language of the proposed law, as it is also my understanding that the government already has the (technical) means to monitor cellular traffic (but it requires a warrant, just like tapping a regular phone).
