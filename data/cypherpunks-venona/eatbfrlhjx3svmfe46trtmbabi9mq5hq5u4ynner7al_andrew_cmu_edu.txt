Eel-skin wallets are made of two types of eels.  Originally, they
were made of a particular species, which was very expensive.
Then someone decided to make cheap eel-skin billfolds.  They used
a different species.  One which erases the magnetic strips.  (at
least it does on credit cards).  I found this out much to my
chagrin when I got a gift from someone.  After I put my cards in
the wallet, I found that when the card was swiped through the
reader, it wouldn't register.  It really P/O'd sales clerks and
bar staff because they'd have to enter the card number and
expiration manually to get an authorization code.  Has this happened to anyone else?
They'd just swipe, and swipe, and swipe . . .

There's the rub.  This is a case of "don't shoot the messanger".
Yes, officer, I do keep a log of all messages.  However, we do
not have the quota to keep the records for an extended period of
time.  They are deleted on a daily basis.  Yes, Sir I understand
that it takes longer than 24 hours for you to obtain a warrant.
Perhaps you can speak to the matter more directly with the
judiciary to help expedite their requirements.
You can count on my *complete* co-operation, however, you must
understand that their are liability issues which must be
addressed.  We stand advised that we can not release any
information without the appropriate paper work.  I'm sure you
understand that. ;-)

Nope,  for the life of me, I couldn't figure what was going on.
Then it was covered on one of those pseudo-news shows.  The
non-erasing wallets used to be very expensive.  These are the
real cheapos.  If my failing memory recalls correctly, the eels
are from the Philippines.
Strange but true. :-)
