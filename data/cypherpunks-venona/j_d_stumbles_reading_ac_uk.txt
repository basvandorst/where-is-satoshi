I saw this on the NZ.general newsgroup and had to share it with the list. 'fraid it's just the reply - the  original must've expired by the time I got there (and I couldn't be bothered to go looking for an archive to track it down in).

A similar method was (is?) allegedly used by H.M. Government depts (and no
doubt others) in restricted documents: the apparently even spacing of
letters along a line to acheive proportional spacing was in fact slightly
uneven and different on each copy, so a whistleblower (or spy) who
photocopied and leaked a document in their posession could be identified
if the copied document were examined. John Stumbles                                      j.d.stumbles

 - because there's bugger all down here on earth!
