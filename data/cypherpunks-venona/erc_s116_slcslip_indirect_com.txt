@_subject: available NNTP posting sites? 
Does anyone have a list of NNTP sites that take connections from anyone
for posting?  My regular NNTP site seems to be hosed, or something, and
I have a post that needs to get out, but also needs to originate from
this site.  Thanks in advance :)

Try ftp.netcom.com:/pub/ec/ecarp/pgpwind.zip - you might find it a bit more

I'm not sure that that's the case. Just because you move in dramatically
politically incorrect circles (no insult intended) you may tend to get
interviewed more than, say, I would.  The fact that I might be working on
more important or interesting things is completely irrelevent. Cypherpunks is 'hot', so the press goes to who are perceived to be the
'movers and shakers' and they are talked to. The people working behind the
scenes on stuff often are ignored in deference to those who are more
visible.  Again, no insult intended, but I think there's a large measure
of truth in it.  The same people keep getting the press while the larger
bulk of the population gets ignored.  It's also geographically-oriented, too - the folks on the West Coast tend to get the majority of the press, followed by the East Coast.  Anyone in between is basically ignored.  I guess the press thinks that no one outside of Silicon Valley or Boston is working on anything of any substance.  Hell, look at Linux - that was done by a guy in Finland, and a college student at that.  I'll bet that's rather embarassing to the "hot shots" in Cupertino :)

If you look out on ftp.netcom.com:/pub/ec/ecarp/linux*, you'll find a bare-

It's intended for SLIP clients, but it could easily be adapted for setting

While there may be something said for Perry's technical expertise, that
certainly doesn't excuse his rudeness.
That all depends on what you are expecting in a development environment, and
what the goal of the development project is.  If your goal is to quickly
produce a GUI interface, then Windows and VB is indeed the way to go.  VB
has reasonable debugging facilities built in.  Not quite as good as gdb,
but reasonable.
If your goal is to produce non-GUI code, then UNIX offers a superior development
No operating system can be all things to all people (much as Bill Gates would
like that to happen).  Most UNIX systems suck at doing real-time processing,
and most Windows systems suck at doing anything approaching preemptive
multitasking.  The right tool for the right job - why make one environment
or the other do everything?
I've been hacking UNIX for 10 years, and doing Windows programming for almost
that long, so I've seen both environments, and know that one size *doesn't*
fit all.
It could be argued by some that UNIX is even less user-friendly than
MS-DOS, but that comes from the fact that UNIX wasn't designed to be anything
approaching a production system.  It was written by programmers for
programmers to hack on.
I'd say "UNIX does it *this* way, therefore it's correct ... for UNIX."
Different OS's do things differently.  Windows is designed to hold the
user's hand.  UNIX isn't.

Extreme government leads to totalitarianism, not socialism.
Governments as a whole are seen to be "bad" because they invariably undermine
the right of the individual to make choices for themselves.
And why should they?  After all, property rights are founded on a belief in
scarcity, which is a total fear-based illusion.
And there are certain areas of society that this scares, and who are already
making steps to stop it and clamp down. Where do you think all the scare
stories about "kiddie porn" and such on the net are coming from?
The so-called "Third Wave" has nothing to do with government and everything to
do with the empowerment of the individual.  Some seem to not recognize that.
This has always been the case throughout history - the forces of dark, of
disinformation, have always attempted to keep true power from the hands of
the people.

I'm not about to split hairs based on one's particular implementation of labels;
rather, I would say that the labels one gives to government don't really
matter.  The purpose of government is to maximize personal freedom while at
the same time minimizing the curtailment of the personal freedoms of others.
I don't think that you can have a meaningful yardstick other than this - it
covers economic as well as social issues.
Agreed, but I don't see that that was the point Rishab was making.  Oh, well..

I might add that esm can be installed on unix boxes in your own account
without having to be root, something which cannot be said for telnetd.
Not everyone has root access to every box they are on, so implementing
one's own interface instead of having to rely on something that requires
root access on every machine makes a lot more sense.

There is a class of people called "idiot savants" who contain people who can also solve such
problems by inspection - their IQs are often much lower than 100, so that
blows Albert's theory.  These so-called "idiot savants" can easily factor
100 digit numbers.  The ability to solve such problems is not tied to IQ,
as there are many such people with IQs of 150+ who cannot solve them.

@_subject: Best encryption device driver for MS-DOS? 
Being in the consulting business, I often write prototype software for
clients in Visual Basic as proof-of-concept and also to make sure I
understand the client's needs before I accept a project.  On occasion,
I have to leave my laptop unattended on someone's desk while I go into
meetings with senior management and try to convince them that I know what
I'm talking about and that I'm worth whatever (exorbitant to them) I'm
asking to do their application for them.  I also do volunteer programming
for several volunteer organizations, and it's the same situation - unattended
laptop while I wander off and chat with management to tell them why it
will take so long to do the impossible. ;)
As you might imagine, I have a full suite of programming tools on the laptop,
including MS Office Pro and VB Pro, both of which are worth about $500
apiece - I'd sure hate to lose them to a malicious cracker, or someone who
would like a personal copy of my source code for their own use, or who just
wants to "borrow" my secret key for awhile.
What do people recommend as the solution for this?  Some sort of IDEA-based
or triple-DES-based device driver would seem to be the answer to this, but
I'm not sure which is the "best" (most reliable, fastest, easiest to set up)
one to use.  I like the sound of Michael Sattler's encryption driver for the
Mac, but alas, I'm running MS-DOS :(
Also, if anyone has any suggestions for a similar driver for Linux, I'd
appreciate it - thanks!

Well, it's rather tacky to turn off the laptop, unplug it, etc., just to
lug it into a boardroom.  Not impressive.
Oh, I'm not worried about the laptop walking off, I'm worried about the
software I've written walking off...
I've never had anyone even attempt to rip off the laptop, but I've had people
ask for "free samples" of the prototype code...
