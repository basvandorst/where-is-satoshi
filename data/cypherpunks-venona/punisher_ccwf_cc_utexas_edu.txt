Hey all,
I just wanted to let you know (as an ex-SEAL), the NSA (and to a limited
extent CIA) have UNBELIEVEABLE resources!
If anyone could crack RSA, DES, OPP...they could.
Never underestimate the power of a "black" budget (or for that matter soup)

Judge; Jury; Executioner....All in a day's work

Punisher: "I haven't reached mine yet"

@_subject: Clipper/Skipjack 
just a quick note to tell you all that I just read an editorial in
info security by John Droge.  He rambles on in much the same way
Dorothy Denning does, terrorists, you can trust that gov't...blah, blah, blah..
Anyway, I was wondering why any sane, 1/10 intelligent person would be
defending the Clipper chip...then I read his bio...he is a VP at
Looks like their PR machine is in full steam! :)
