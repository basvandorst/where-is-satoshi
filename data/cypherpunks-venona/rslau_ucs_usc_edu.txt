From: jim (Jim Miller)

   Has California has recently begun fingerprinting welfare applicants     to help detect attempts at welfare cheating?
Yes...  Was on all local news channels for a day or two.  They were asking
applicants whether they thought it was an invasion of their privacy.  Some
said yes, others no, nothing surprising.  Can't remember the name of the
project or who's technology they're using...  Searching for matches takes
'only a few minutes', future plans include links to other agencies, *for ID
purposes only mind you* :) and faster matching...  Be great if someone with
more detailed info posted...

@_subject: radio program - Los Angeles area only 
today's topic on Which Way LA (KCRW 89.9FM, Los Angeles) was on phone,
computer, etc.  privacy, and how the government is doing everything it can
to take it away from us.  at least that's what the spots have said.
presumably about clipper, FBI wiretap laws, etc.  first broadcast was at
13:00 but i missed it, being rebroadcast at 19:00.
i don't have a tape deck in my office, but i guess i could digitize it.
sorry for all of you outside LA, which is probably 99.3598% of you... :)

just heard it myself and yes, it was very good.
luckily, all participants talked fast (i can't stand slow talkers :)
so they got their points in...
i digitized it though i missed the first minute (nothing important, intro
only) and a few seconds after the first station id break.  cheezy sun mike
pickup only since i couldn't find a patch cable in time but it sounds okay.
does anybody want a 26Mb .au file (uncompressed) ?  heh :)
i'll make it available on my home page soon,
but it's available via anon ftp now.
mail me if you want it...
what's the copyright laws on this stuff anyway?
