To treat various Venerial Diseases whose standard treatments are
antibiotics. What does seem to have credence is that the use of antibiotics breeds
resistant strains of bacteria, which may or may not be contagious.
A book that poses an opposing viewpoint to the current AIDS epidemic
is _The AIDS War_ by John Lauritsen (1993, Asklepios, New York, ISBN
0-943742-08-0).  It is written from a Gay man's perspective dissenting
from the current HIV-AIDS theory.  Another book he wrote is _Poison by
Prescription: The AZT Story_.  Also search on Peter H. Duesberg for
primary sources in various Journals.

Has anyone compiled a summary of the difference of volume of posts to
the lists?  I'd be interested to find out.
I just started subscribing to the list near the time it started, so I
have not noticed a difference.  If the unmoderated list is not much
more (~10%) I think I'd prefer the unmoderated list.
