Nothing is more American than a hot bowl of Chili, but if you ask a hundred people about how to make the best bowl of chili you'll probably get a hundred different answers.
America's Best Chili Recipes hopes to help answer this question by offering fifty of the most diverse Chili recipes that you will find anywhere. Plus, these recipes don't come from any sterile kitchen test labs, but from the family picnics,backyard barbecues, and tailgate parties of Chili lovers from across America. Our book is divided into four separate chapters:
Chapter I	Traditional Chili Chapter II	Chili with Beans
Chapter III	Low Fat/Vegetarian Chili
Chapter IV	Prize Winners			
Among the recipes you'll enjoy are:
***Barbecue Chile from New Jersey
***Lobster Chili from Maine
***Seven Pepper Chili from San Antonio
***Kosher Chili from New York ***Nuclear Chili from San Francisco
In addition, with each recipe you'll get the story behind the recipe. Each contribution contains an entertaining story or anecdote from the person who sent the recipe. Read about:
*** The Ghost in the Chili Pot
*** The Secret behind Comet Chili
*** Chili passed down through three generations of LA Firemen
Buy the book for the recipes, or buy it for the stories. You'll find that there is a chili recipe for every finicky eater.
