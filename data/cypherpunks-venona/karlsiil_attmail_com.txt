Bill, et. al.,
To clarify, the Emergency Access (EA) feature's owner (e.g., the Site Security
Officer (SSO)) can determine whether to *allow* users to disable EA. A possible way one brings RSA Secure to the(ir) masses of users is as follows:
The important thing here is that the ability to control the RSA Secure "policy" is in the same hands as the responsiblity for creating the org's security policy, if any.
Personally, I find RSA Secure to be quite a nice package, from a usage point of view. The way it blends into FileManager is really convenient. The less I have to "work at" security, the more likely it is that I'll use it. The crypto
is satisfactory for my needs and I'm not going to rehash (no pun intended) the
arguments over RC4-40, etc.

OK, I'll bite. Where do I get it? Where did you get your info? Do you have a AEgis Research (who I know nothing about) has come out with a very pleasant
windows fron end for PGP. It is bone-head compliant, and even works well in
Win95. I'm only plugging because I was so impressed. Until Eudora has PGP
hooks, this is my shell of choice.
