I think the libertarian position is inherently pro-crypto.
Besides, the French are socialist, and well, as far as crypto goes...
Whatever. Clinton proposed crypto, some democrat wrote the electronic
decency act. (In fact Gingrich was against it)
I think that to some extent it is very relavant to gun control in that
both can be abused and that both help the law-abiding citizen do things.

I don't see whats wrong with removing any checking done by PGP.
(ie don't keep a checksum or whatever) After all, they can't prove
that you didn't just encrypt a pgp +makerandom file.
Obviously, I would not want to use this "feature" in some cases,
so make adding a checksum be an extra command line option.
The new feature would of course not be backwards compatible, but
there is no way to disable the "feature" and no way to attach
loud alarm bells.
Of course, you are then faced with giving them a key which you know
will decrypt the file to gibberish. Ideally, you would steno the encrypted file.

It compiled on mine just fine. Be sure you have an up to date
bintools and gcc.
1. Make sure you are using 2.5.2/2.6.3. Thats how I compiled mine.
2. Unzip the source in /usr/src/pgp (or whereever)
3. cd /usr/src/pgp/rsaref/install/unix
4. make
5. cd /usr/src/pgp/src
6. make linux
And you should have a pgp binary.
7. cp /usr/src/pgp/src/pgp /usr/local/bin/pgp
Though they might differ, the MD5 hash of my Linux version is Good luck!

@_subject: /dev/audio RNG 
I've been working on a Linux RNG. I'm sure you could port this, but it might take some work for Microsoft based programs...
--- CLIP HERE ---
   $s||die"Syntax: $0 bytes security\n";open(O,"|./md5");while(time<$t){
read(A,$x,500);print O $x;}close O;}close A;print"\n";
# USAGE: rng  . One external command is used:
# ./md5 which I created using #   gcc -O3 -mpentium -o md5 md5.c md5drivr.c # where md5drivr.c is modified so that MDFilter()'s line printf("\n")
# is commented out.
--- CLIP HERE ---
Runtime = security * (bytes/16) assuming your machine is fast enough.
Each set of 16 bytes uses $s seconds of /dev/audio input to create.
I guess you could replace /dev/audio with /dev/mouse. Of course, if you
get nothing but d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e you may want to use
some other source. :)

Netscape, Windows (its a school computer) works fine w/ a proxy.
When there is no proxy, Windows dies. EMM dies. Lots of stuff dies.
So use a proxy.
Sometimes you won't expect it, ie for netscape enhancements click
here (or on the Netscape logo).

@_subject: Re: One-Time-Pad generation from audio device 
I wouldn't bet on it. I did a similar hack with perl, with a much more
conservative 5 seconds to 32 bytes. That didn't cut it, when I ent'ed the
result it gave 6 bits of entropy / 8 bits of output.
I do recall posting it here.
Um.. I would try to generate bits quickly, then securely, so for example
you get a 2k buffer and do it 5 sec / 128 bits. Then slow down and overwrite
the buffer and give warnings if the user wants to use the bits too early.

I just picked it up from UBS for $49.95. It's ordered at B&N for $39.95
I think.
