Did anyone hear about a device called LC-1? It is a voice encryption
hardware that uses IDEA. I've found info about it on a Germany server. Tried
to contact two guys that developed the thing and got no answer. One of the
guys' names is Kurt (khuwig and the other one is Marko
Any comments would be appreciated.
