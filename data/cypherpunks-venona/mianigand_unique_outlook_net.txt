@_subject: What to do about Germany 
What the German goverement threatned to do was inexcusable, but something can be done about it.
The way that mail and postings are handeld, it is possible to trash mail and posting coming or going to a certin destination.  This is censorship, but maybe the members of the goverment have justified such an action.
If they can censor others, should others not be able to censor them?  That's one of the beauties of the electronic age, the only thing that matters is intelligence, numbers or political power have negligable Are the german authorities worthy of such an reaction? Have they crossed the line?
If they have, maybe they can serve as the example of what happens when a group of people attempt to force their will on others.

So what does the above paragraph mean, it was not the goverment that threated, it was a procecutor who was acting on behalf of the govement to enforcese the laws of that body which is what he is paid to do.  Gee, that's what I said, only alot more complicated and detailed.  In the end, the party at fault is the some division of the German goverment, the procecutor is not an individual person acting on his/her own behalf.
But that's a GERMAN law, the Internet is an INTERNATIONAL community.  If we have to respect the laws of Germany, and their customs and archaic belief systems, them we have to give the same consideration to anyother countries backwords, morality-based, mentality.  There are hundreds of countries on the planet, most of them backwards.  Respect everybodys sence of decency and right and wrong and nobody will be able to transmit anything the least be vulgar becasue it would violate some countries law some where on the planet.
They do exist, but I have been breaking them since 13, I don't care to be protected by some "moral" and "ethical" person, I can decide for myself what I can and can not do.
 > how to offer pornographic material and comply with the law at the
That's just brilliant exhange one evil for another.  Instead of censorship, we take away people's rights to autonymity and privacy.
Sorry, not an option.
Or they can be given consequences for their actions.  Let it be known that people will not tolerate them enforcing their laws on everybody.  The weaker any goverment, the more ineffective it is in imposing it's will, the better off individuals are.
No the prosecutor does not have a choice, that's why you attact the people that make the laws, or the governing body as a whole.  They try to impose there will on me, I will unlease my dirty tricks on them.  Fair is fair.
I have the ablity to impose my will on ohters, I have done so when certin persons have gotten on my nerves by posting things to newsgroups that were blatently off topic and they had been told and warned about it on serveral occasions.  But when you go to a sexualy explicit newsgroup, what do you think you will find, what is the purpose of such a group?  Protection of children is a parents responsiblity, if they can't handle that responsiblity, that is thier problem, not mine.
 Given my experiencewith the German government,
Again, that is Germany's problem, not mine, make it an issue and suffer the consequences.

Well, this could be away for compuserve to cover it's rear in a realy slick fashion. If they chose to do it this way.
Most CIS subscribers use their proprietary interface, which puts a GUI front end over what is going on with them modem, what they amount to are scripts. Anyways, CIS could add a script that would check the NUH identifier, if it is in Germany, it goes to one newsfeed, if it's outside of Germany, it would go to another newsfeed.  They could even market the service here in the US to those who like censorship.
What could be "Accidentaly" leaked is a different version of the same file, that would not contain the check.
That way, Compuserve could claime that the offending parties tampered with the software, and they can not be help responsible for the I highly doubt that Compuserve would go for such a resolution, but it's worth throwing into the mix

Within reason is the Key Phrase.  Even with a Pentium 90, I notice a considerable lag in decrypting messages that have been encrypted with a key larger than 2047/8.
Even if you have a fast machine, if the person recieving the message could wait a long time to decrypt you 4096 byte encrypted message.

@_subject: Re: Revoking Old Lost Keys 
It's an administrative nightmare.  I assume that you mean if the key is widley distributed.  If it's only circulating among a small group of people that know each other, no problem.  If it's widley distributed, or on a keyserver, that becomes hard.  First you would have to be authenticated as the origional key owner, ie how do I realy know that you are you, and not somebody saying you are the orgional key owner?
Another problem, let's say I get your public key from Bob, who signed your key, and Bob knows you have revoked your key, but I don't, so what happens to my copy of your key? Since there is no revokation certificate, I am forced to take Bob's word that you have indeed want to revoke your key, but have no way of verifying that without talking to you, and agin I have to go through the same verification process that Bob did.
Good topic. Michael Peponis

Congradulations to Philip, but Phill(boy this is getting confussing) is right.
By dropping the case, the goverment avoids a high visiblity case that could change the rules.  What happened to Phillip Zimmermann is unexcusable, but others must continue in his footsteps in order to win a decicive victory.

Well, as bad as the lack of anonymity may be, NNTP server logs serve a very usefull purpose, ie finding and eliminating trolls and spammers.

Why not just read from the open server, and post anonyomously using anonymous remailers and News-to-Mail Gateways?

@_subject: re Telecoms Bill 
:I'm not familiar with SSL protocols, but something that would anonymize :web page access and keep it entirely encrypted (not just credit card or
:forms transactions) would be good.
I think the first problem would be how to hide a sites true location.  For example, if I have a domain called xxx.offensivestuff.org, how would I hide the sight so that while it is freely accessable to those who are looking for it, yet not allow a goverment agency to home in on the geographical locations via trace route.
I remember reading a number of articles about floating sites, the only problem is with the way Internet routing tables are structured, given that the site would constantly spoof different ip's to make it harder to track, or maybe even hacking some of the routing tables on the larger gateways, it could cause all sorts of problems with traffic.  ie domain xxx.offensivesutt.org has the routing information for  but if xxx.offensivestuff.com moves, then that routining information is invalid. resulting in numerous broadbad broadcasts trying to determine the correct route to Additonally, a number of bogus proxie servers could be set up to confuse traffic analysis in attempting to determine what the true endpoint of a transfer is.
At some point, the data could be encrypted by a proxie server, and sent to the final destination.  Thus just like e-mail is reordered by remailers, HTTP/FTP/Telnet connections can be shuffled around to foil analysis.
Of course, this approch would result in a slower connection and more packet :Encrypted/truly anonymous ftp would be nice (though some folx would :understandably have problems with truly anonymous uploads, and crypto :export restrictions in the US could be problematic legally).
Under the forementioned technique, it would not be problematic technically.
:I think there is already work on encrypted telnet (stel) by the CERT/IT I have seen an SSL telnet client source code on hactic I think.
:On the non-net side of things, implementing encrypted BBS/communications :and file-transfers is useful.  I'm told PGP-Phone is supposed to support :encrypted communications/file-transfers... so a host-script language that :enables a simple BBS would be nice.
I like this idea, but I am not sure how the laws work.  For example if a BBS had subscribers sign a voucher stating that they were not agent of a goverment agency, would it hold up? would lying constitue entapment?
If not, then yes, encrypting the data would provide protection becasue no one would be able to detect what was being passed.  under this approch  information gained by wiretapping would not be usefull.

Basically here is the problem.  Like it or not, most people in the world are utter morons that behave more like stupid helpless heard animals than higher life forms.
Because, the are dumb as shit.  It's simple really, back to the origional point, most people are about as bight as a rock, they don't care about anything other than stuffing there pathetic faces, waching the idoit box, and passing on their bad genetic structure and pathetic world view.  That is all they have, it's not that they have anything to contribute to the world.  They are pathetic, since they have no life, and know that their world view hasn't got a prayer in a free market place of ideas, they choose to maintain it by force.
Vote? we are dealing with a nation of braindeads here.  Do whatever the hell you want and fuck the law.  Does anybody honestly believe I actually care what the law says I should and should not do, like I actually care what other people think?  I do what I want, and if somebody(s) else gets in my face, they will get hurt, if not perished.
Tim May made the point, there are hundreds of nations consisting of braindead All of them  trying to preserve their outdated way of life, I have zero respect for them. They want to protect there religion, or national idetity, or morals, or whatever, and they know that the majority of thinking people will choose there way of life if they could pick form all of the alternatives.
I do not vote, I live in AmeriKa, but do not consider myself and AmeriKian, I just happened to be born among them, and stuck living with them, not like anyother place is any better or worse, although their are degrees, they are all ran by and for brain deads.

In my opinion, only the most basic of services, trash collection, road maintenance, education (decided upon experts, not just people with opinions. I don't claime to be an expert on history, so why should I have a say on how it is tought, I have no expertise in that area).
In a true democracy, which is based on a very diverse general populace, will result in a system that will not be able to pass any legislation except those described above, it will be imporable for the majority to agree to anything except the most basic things.
Why I hate this goverment is that it tries to decide what is right and wrong, that is my decision, not theirs.  I am accountable to me and my God as to what I do with my life, I am not accountable to any society as long as I do not infrige on someone elses rights.
Unfortunalty, I don't see such a goverment happening, I don't care about if anyone else likes the way I choose to conduct my life or not, but the majority of any country has this assine persistance to perpetuate their traditions and beliefs on others, it is their form of progegation.

If I remember correctly, are not American Indian reservations considered qusi-sovergin states under the law?
If this is true, what would stop me from negotiating with some tribe to establish an ISP on the reservation and then placing whatever material I wanted on that site without fear of reprisals from the US goverment.
After all, if they are a soveign state, decency is covered by whatever laws they have, if any, not the CDA.
If this is true, the Indians get the benift of having state-of-the-art telecommunications in thier communities, plus residual job creation, and everyone else gets freedom of speech.
