Here's a short piece from Scientific American on RSA, PEM, PGP etc.
Notice towards the end this article says "The U.S. is the only nation
that permits the patenting of mathematical algorithms."
That threw me at first -- it's not *supposed* to be permitted, but in
practice, it is.  So I suppose this is a true statement.
(The cover article of this Sci Am is on a team at the Science Museum in
London that did a 3-ton implementation of Babbage's Difference Engine.)

Electronic Envelopes?
The uncertainty of keeping e-mail private
  Recent legislative efforts to mandate remote wiretapping attachments
for every telephone system and computer network in the U.S. may have
been the best thing that every happened for encryption software.  "We
have mostly the FBI to thank," says John Gilmore of Cygnus Support in
Palo Alto, Calif.  Gilmore is an entrepreneur, hacker and electronic
civil libertarian who helped to found the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF).  He is now watching closely the development of two
competing techniques for keeping electronic mail private.
  As matters now stand, computers transmit messages from one user to
another in plain text.  If a geneticist in Boston sends e-mail to a
molecular biologist in San Diego, any of the half a dozen or so
intermediary machines that forward the letter could siphon off a copy

__CYPHERPUNKS
fellow cypherpunks -- I'm forwarding you this copy of SURFPUNK that
I just produced.  It tries to deal with the cypherpunk events of the last few days.  If someone has a good summary of all this, a cypherpunk press release, so to speak, I'd love to publish it, too.
Also corrections and clarifications and even flames are welcome.
Brief info on SURFPUNK -- we cover cypherpunk, cyberpunk, conscious hacking, public policy, what's new on the net, etc.
We republish a lot of hard information from other lists.
We have some overlap with cypherpunks, but pretty much SURFPUNK is reaching 300 more people.

Whew.  It's been a long time.  Apologies.  I've had a different sort of
mailer problems each week.  But I hope we're back now to stay.
If you haven't received an issue since  on Wed, 5 May 93,
you're not missing any.  We've been out for a good month.
Our address has simplified.  We are now simply "surfpunk
It used to be "surfpunk  You can now drop the "osc".
If you are missing surfpunks, or want old backissues, use the "www" (or "xmosaic") server with the Universal Record Locator

This issue will contain a number of documents relating to
cryptography.  The last couple of months have seen a lot of action in
this realm, and I wish I had a good summary of what the big moves were
and what the current status is.  It would be difficult, however, to
separate the plain fact of what documents say from what they imply and
what is really going on behind the scenes.
Here's a very brief, highlevel summary, from my own point of view.
It's probably not too far off from the consensus at the Mountain View
Cypherpunks physical meeting last weekend.  It discussses US policy,
but it will certainly influence the rest of the world's policies.
We seem to be moving from an era when the US policy on cryptography was
something like this:  Any encryption is legal within the US [ and
perhaps Canada ] boundaries, but only very weak encryption can be
exported.  The restrictions on export may not have made much sense on
the surface, but they have sucessfully prevented the really popular
products from using encryption.  In effect, the available encryption is
weak enough that a determined agent, perhaps the U S Government, can
easily crack it.
The new era might be this:  Strong encryption is available within the
US, and even mandated in some cases, but only encryption that leaves
"escrowed" keys is allowed.  The escrowed keys are available to the U S
Government.   Any other strong encryption is made illegal.
How to make encryption illegal is a good question.  Any strings of
seemingly random numbers could potentially be an encrypted message.
Could you imagine going to jail if you cannot decode stray bits?
I'm not going to try to convince you that this is the ultimate goal,
but I do hope you will try to understand what is happening.  A paranoid
view is that all of these decisions are already made, and the
technology is in place, and now, with only token public debate, the
system will be put in place.  If this is correct, then President
Clinton will be of little help; he is already a strong proponent of the
Clipper chip.  I don't know if the paranoid view is correct, but it is
Sorry if this isn't a fun issue.  I hope the documents I pick are helpful.  What's in this issue of SURFPUNK:
