(Reproduced from )
Eavesdropping on the line Secure electronic communication is becoming increasingly important. In
recent years, quantum cryptography has been investigated as a means of
detecting eavesdroppers on private lines. When quantum mechanical processes
are used to establish the 'key' used for encryption and decryption, any
eavesdropping during transmission leads to an unavoidable and detectable
disturbance in the received key information. This technique has been
demonstrated to be effective on standard communication lines between two
users, but Paul D. Townsend now introduces a practical scheme for a
multi-user network. This work demonstrates the technical feasibility of
quantum cryptography for practical applications.  P D Townsend Quantum

While I am not involved with the cellular area of Qualcomm, I am
familiar with the publishing policies of Nature and Science as a
reader of both for the last ten years.  Neither journal shies away
from controversy.  We have only the author's say-so as to why their
papers were rejected.  To me Occams Razor suggests bad science as
a better explanation than conspiracy.
I sent the following to Stewart Fist:
His response:
So there's been no confirmation or checking of the science involved, or why
the papers were rejected by both an American and British science journal.

Not that it would have mattered except to scanner owners with too much time
on their hands.  The LEAs can intercept at the cellular base station where
the air segment traffic is decrypted.  This is true for GSM, TDMA, and
CDMA.  True security requires end-to-end encryption.  While slightly
possible for mobile-to-mobile calls where each phone has the encryption
engine, it all breaks down if the base station doesn't preserve a digital
pathway all the way through.  Most base stations do tandem vocoding for
mobile-to-mobile connections as it's the easiest engineering solution.
For mobile-to-landline, the landline options are decidely minimal.  If you
go with STU-III you have the problem of a fixed-rate 4800 baud modulation
sucking up bandwidth.  That could be put in the base station but then the
path is no longer end-to-end.

The difference is that the lack of means to feed oneself is usually self-
selected.  Political criminals, or people simply unaware that they're felons
under an increasing number of laws, seldom have a choice whether they will
be arrested and tried.
Certainly the preferred solution is to junk most of the laws on the books.
However until committing a felony is an explicit conscious act, we will
need court-appointed attorneys for persecution victims.

We also did not provide our children's SSNs for the last few years.  We
obtained and supplied them rather than fight the IRS.  In the Social
Security Number FAQ is this section:
Registering your Children
The Family Support Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-485) requires states to require
parents to give their Social Security Numbers in order to get a birth
certificate issued for a newborn. The law allows the requirement to be
waived for "good cause", but there's no indication of what may qualify.
Section 1615 of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 strengthened
the requirement for taxpayers to report SSNs for dependents over one year
of age when they are claimed as a deduction. ( H.R.3448
, became PL104-188
8/20/96.) The new law allows the IRS to treat listing a dependent without
including an SSN as if it were an arithmetic error. This apparently means
that the taxpayer isn't allowed to petition the tax court.

Even a fizzle with a yield in the hundreds of tons equivalent is respectable.
Plutonium decay products have a high neutron cross-section and steal the
fast neutrons necessary for the chain reaction to build.  Sufficient amounts
can kill off the last three or more re-doublings which is where most of the
explosive power comes from.  On the other hand finely dispersed Pu and
other fission products plus the irradiated material that becomes radioactive
will make a few square miles dangerous to inhabit for several years.

Body Parts May Become a Way To Identify ATM Customers
By GORDON FAIRCLOUGH Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
Thomas J. Drury walks up to the automated-teller machine in his suburban
office and swipes his bank card. Instead of punching in a secret code,
however, he stares straight ahead. The machine verifies his identity by
looking at his eyes.
If Mr. Drury, chief executive officer of Sensar Corp., and his colleagues
have their way, this eye-scanning technology will become standard equipment
on ATMs around the world. It is being tested by NCR Corp. and Citicorp,
among others.
