The CMRK must not be used in eMails. It may be used in storing folders.x
If it does work in that way, it's GAK to temprorary communication keys.

Just returned from the source ... PGP 5.0 does encrypt to every so called
'message recovery key' mentioned in the public key self certificate option
if it is marked required or optional. If a key is missing, it fails encryting.
IIRC it does work on unhashed uncritical signature packets, too.

Right. Communication is 'in transit' from MUA to MUA. Stored messages on

The company *owns* all telephon calls mad from an to there office. So they
have a right to wiretrap and record all phone calls you does from the
company. If you don't want your *private* corrospondance be wiretraped and
recorded, prevent every phone call in private issues from the company.
Forbit your insurance agency to call you in the company, deny the school

Somebody should thing about storing and communication. Look in the current

Yes. Nobody but the policy can stop them and have a deeper look.
Yes, they can make statistics. Personal specific? No. Not here.
Yes. They have the right to close the door. Even for minutes.
He has this right until he touchs the rights of other people. So he have not
all rights he might want.
Do you own your house? If not, why do you stop your house owner from

In common enviroments smartcards are used for the example above. Those
smartcards can be only obtained by TTPs, which generate the key pair and
press the secret part on the card. In several countries these TTP are
required to store these private keys for gouvernmental access.
Shure, it's constitutional. You will need a court order to read a special
message with the revealed secret key.
It does not harm, that policy may able to read all previous messages, if
they are stored, because this can't happen. The police is forbitten to do so.

Generate your PGP 5.5 key with an optional (sic!) recovery key the FBI. I'm
pretty sure, PGP 5.0 will encrypt to both without asking you.

No the key requested is 'snoop
But the ROT13 encoding is true even for PGP5. If you move or rename the
randseed.bin to an other location (i.E. to install pgp2.6.3(i)n and pgp5
simultanusly) the file will be modified, but all encrypted messages have the
same session key.
On the other hand pgp5 does not confirm the OpenPGP draft. A converter can
be found at ftp://ftp.iks-jena.de/pub/mitarb/lutz/crypt/software/pgp/OpenPGP/
