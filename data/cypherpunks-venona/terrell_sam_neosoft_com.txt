Just an aside --
  J C Penney invented the $n.95 pricing scheme so that his clerks
would have to make change.  That way they had to use their registers,
recording the sale and the cash didn't just go into their pockets.
Even at that early date, proper security of automated systems depended
largely on human factors.

Cypherpunks can do more by being cypherpunks.  Your keyboards are
better weapons than checkbooks in this case.  Why isn't PGP so simple
that every luzer on AOL will use it without thinking?  Why hasn't
the NetScape key been broken?  Prove these proposed laws are just as
silly and ineffective as they look by demonstrating it.
Lots of people will attack these laws on legal grounds, and you should
too if your conscience so moves you, but very few have the
capabilities to attack them on technical grounds where their
vulnerabilities are real, not just a matter of opinion.

@_subject: Re: Demagnetizing 
It's much more low-tech than that.  Libraries and book stores just
put a strip of magnetized material (it's much like audio tape,
about 1/8 inch wide and comes on rolls) inside the book and then
put detectors at the doorway.  It the detector feels a magnetic field,
it buzzes; if the tape has been deguassed, nothing happens.
For libraries, it's usually mounted on sticky tape and put down
inside the book spine.  Bookstores usually just snip off a 4 - 5"
segment and slip it inside the book.  Music stores frequently tape
a small section on the outside of CD jewel boxes.
Sorry, there's no real mystery or exciting tech here.

If you've ever watched Not_at_all_Funny Home Videos or any of the
American Urinal school of tabloid television, you soon start feeling
that the real threat to privacy is not the guvmint, but all of
the yoyos with their little cam corders running around pointing them
at people.
Security cameras in ATMS and at airline ticket counters do more
to threaten you privacy than do FIBBIE wiretaps, and PGP won't
protect you from them. (and usually neither will the courts).

@_subject: Re: A problem with anonymity 
Actually, you guys are trying to repeat the whole history of the
law merchant (today's commercial law).  The basic problem was how
can a buyer in one city acquire goods from a seller in another
through agents acting at a distance when neither knows the other
and neither is willing to risk loss on the transaction.
The use of bankers, as either trusted or bonded third parties,
acting as escrowees under the control of a letter of credit was
the result.
Buyer, B, deposits money with the bank, E, with insructions
to release the money on proof of receipt of the goods.  E gives
B a receipt and a written promise to pay.  B trades the promise
to pay to Seller, S, in exchange for the goods.  S, who either
trusts E or has access to his bond, is willing to accept E's
promise to pay, which he then negotiates.  The result is that
B and S have a secure transaction without trusting each other,
and E gets rich.
Notice, we don't care about the reputation or identity of either
B or S, and a very few trusted or bonded Es can facilitate
many many transacrions.
Incidentially, you all are using the word "escrow" correctly.
An escrow is an arrangement in which property is deposited with
an escrowee to hold until the happening or failure of a
contingency, at which time he delivers the property according to
the escrow instructions.  House sales, in which the seller deposits
a deed and the buyer deposits the purchase price pending proof of title
is only one kind of escrow.

The real secret is that for most banks the individual transaction
is << than the total stream of transactions.  Defaulting on a single
transaction will show a profit that is miniscule compared to the
over-all earnings at stake if the bank's credibility is jeopardized.
When banks have gotten into trouble it is frequently when they allow
one customer or one transaction to represent a significant share
of their business.  You have a high probability of being able to
trust an escrowee with your $1 if you know he intends to collect
commissions on holding $1million for others based on his "trusted"

@_subject: cryptography eliminates lawyers? 
How could crypto put lawyers out of business?  People would still
have disagreements; plans would still go wrong; cars would still
crash.  More important, transactions would still need to be structured to carry out the desires of the parties while minimizing
Good communications technology, including crypto, could make lawyering
more efficient, but I suspect the savings would be minimal.
Communications technology will no more put lawyers out of business
than CASE put programmers out of business.
