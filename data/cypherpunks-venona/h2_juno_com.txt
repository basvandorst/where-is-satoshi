@_subject: IP spoofer 
Anyone got a good IP spoofer that can spoof the whole domain?  The only
shit I can find is those shitty ones that spoof the first part of the
IDENTD which is possible to do in mIRC if you use it.  Oh yeah, it has to
be for Win95.  Yes I know that no one likes win95 but I dont have a
choice....I'll tell about that later.

Are there any good programs out there that can encrypt my HD??  Since
there probably are, please mention some and where I can get them.  Also,
no one mention PGP.

Thanks for the tip!  My friend is good with electronics and he is
building a red box using all chips and shit.  He found out some equation
to use so when a capacitor fills up and then discharges to a resistor,
using a certain equation u can generate frequencys.  I also found out
that you can do the same with QBasic.  I wish there was a way to blue
box, but it seems that there's not.  Thanks for everything.
