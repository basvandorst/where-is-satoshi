I have written a freeware encryption program for the Macintosh that,
I feel, offers the strongest encryption for the Mac to date.
Paranoid  allows you to encrypt files with IDEA, triple DES,
or a third algorithm which I wrote (your choice).
Paranoid also allows you to encrypt files into sounds.
The only known bugs are in the grammar of the readme file. :)
Paranoid is available by FTP from FTP.CSN.NET:
first you must read the file /mpj/README which explains the legal
restrictions for retrieving certain files.  Paranoid will be
available as where ??????  changes  at random times (as explained in the README file)

the file is also available at RIPEM.MSU.EDU at
but check first the README file in that directory for instructions.
