@_subject: SKIP IP-layer encryption release Beta 2.3 
We are pleased to announce the newest release of our domestic source
reference implementation into the public domain.
IP-layer encryption and authentication package with full key management.
Both FreeBSD 2.1.0 and SunOS 4.1.3 are supported in this release.
DES, triple-DES and SAFER are supported for encryption and keyed-MD5 is
supported for authentication.
This source produces a package which contains a loadable module which
works with existing TCP/IP stacks.  You do not need to replace (or even
recompile) your IP stack to use this package.
SKIP encrypts traffic at the IP packet layer.  Applications do not need
to be recompiled or modified to take advantage of encryption.
Source and pre-built binaries (for FreeBSD 2.1.0) may be obtained by US

    and/or non-commercial purposes.
