Terawatts for a few microseconds is fairly standard technology, I believe.  Femtosecond laser pulses driven by *very* large capacitor banks... It's easy to generate lots of power through fusion.  The problem is confinement.

A few years ago an engineer at one of the weapons labs found
a new solution to Maxwells equations.  This was briefly
reported in the general press, and seemed to imply that the
solutions found allowed for soliton-like wave packets. Some time later there were experiments reported using water
tanks with specially shaped wave generators that were trying
to create a water-wave analog.  The article describing these
experiments speculated, if I remember correctly, that
special antenna geometry and manipulation of the input
signal might be used to generate a electromagnetic wave
equivalent.  There was also brief speculation about uses for
such a device -- beamed energy packets, for communications,
or, at high power, for energy transfer.  Or weapons. Anyone else remember this?

Not a big deal.
Its pretty straightforward for interested perties to get a list of everyone
on a mojordomo mailinglist even if the who command is disabled as long as
we have our old friend sendmail and his trusty sidekick expn.

I have xed out the names but you get the picture. no need to go through the
effort of watching a list for posts or searching through someone's old mail.
