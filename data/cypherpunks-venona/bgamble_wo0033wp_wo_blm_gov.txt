I got it too.  And since I am a new subscriber, I thought it might be the
normal traffic.  The Welcome msg *did* say the list is high-traffic.  Still,
I was aghast--300 all at once, another 100 just in the last hour.  Is that
typical? (Please forgive such a question from a newcomer to the list.)
I'm just posting this to see if there's something wrong with my mail  filter
- it dumped a ton of messages from this list over the night, and  I'm trying
to figure out why the ! it did that.  Sorry for the  interruption.

I subscribed just once, real name. Yep, the Welcome msg is ReallyTrulyFine[M].
 I reallytrulyread it.  High-traffic, though, is relative.  In light of
Z.B.'s post , I thought that maybe I , too, had a mail probem.  Seriously,
thanks for the info.  Usually, between 35 and 100 posts a day, most of which I delete.  Did you subscribe twice or three times under slightly different names  (but
identical e-mail adresses)?
RTFine Welcome Message, it explains everything you have to know
Hope you'll stay with us.
