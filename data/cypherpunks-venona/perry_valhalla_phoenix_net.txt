@_subject: IMPORTANT: Valhalla is leaving alias.net domain!! 
NOTICE: valhalla.phoenix.net is leaving the alias.net domain! Please
change your entries from remailer and
wmono to remailer and
wmono accordingly. Apparently double-domaining
valhalla in SunOS 4.1.3 causes severe DNS problems that I can't explain at
this time. I apologize for the inconvenience.
Raph, can you change the entry to your remailer list accordingly ASAP??
