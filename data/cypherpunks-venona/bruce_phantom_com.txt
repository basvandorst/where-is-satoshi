school.  Generally "Our salesman is going to be in your neighboorhood" is
just a way to get people to feel like they'd better look at the product now
rather than later.  It doesn't mean they know where you live.  However,
unless your number is unlisted it will probably be in the Coles directory
(along with such information as how long you've lived at that residence). It sounds like an ordinary cold call.

That's a really _REALLY_ good point.  I mean, a weak government encryption
standard (like um . . . DES) is basically no different than abolishing the
Fourth Ammendment.  Right?  Right?  Right . . .

You obviously don't understand much of the "loud-mouthed ass's psychology."  Limbaugh is very anti-statist and if he had a position on the issue there's a good change it would be anti-clipper.  Last time I checked, the clipper's biggest supporters were Clinton and Gore, who aren't exactly
Rush's favorite people.

Good point.  It's not widely known but in fact the US Military-Industrial complex is controlled by seven Freemasons who operate from a hidden control center in the British Virigin Islands*.  The group of seven have been planning World Domination for the past thirty years.  The military action which resulted in the overthrow of Manuel Noreiga and the ruthless installation of a democratically-elected government in Panama was just a precedent to the next step which is to slam the Voyager I and II probes into jupiter and ignite their on-board hydrogen bombs.  This will create a nucleur reaction in Jupiter's core turning it into a new Sun and bringing about the environmental catastrophe They** will use to enslave Earth's population.  And that's the _REAL_ reason They're worried about anonymous remailers.  *Refer to page 73 or the "Protocols of the Elder's of Zion"
** Also known as THEM and THOSE PEOPLE

Getting into PC Expo is easy, I just received 30 passes from a vendor
who's going to be there.  Just ask and exhibtor and they'll send you passes.  I think handing out floppy disks is NOT a very cost efficient scheme.  It makes more sense to spend the money on xeroxing flyers explaining to people what encryption is, why it's important and how they can get the tools for themselves.  Very people are going to load up a program from a disk that some stranger gave them.  You'll also likely get thrown out of Javitts.
