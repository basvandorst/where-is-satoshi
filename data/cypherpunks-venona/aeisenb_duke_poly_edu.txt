@_subject: Cookies on Microsoft Explorer? 
Does anyone know what the equivalent technology is on Microsoft to
Netscape's cookie technology?  Does Microsoft have support for cookies or not?  All of the discussion on the list to do with
cookies is related to Netscape.  Does this mean that if one switches to
Microsoft Explorer one can avoid the problem?  Many thanks.

@_subject: DoubleClick: Does is track browsing across multiple sites? 
Does anyone know whether DoubleClick really is tracking browsing patterns
across multiple sites?  They claim to be able to do this; is it just
advertising hype, or does anyone have knowledge of its actually doing so?
Many thanks.
