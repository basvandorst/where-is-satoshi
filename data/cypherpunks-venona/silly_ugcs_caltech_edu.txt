In mlist.cypherpunks you write:
Help!   What does GAK stand for?  I've seen it a billion times,
but I missed the original explanation.
It sounds like some sort of key/crypto registration.

I've spent a great deal of time looking for an archive of these sorts of actions, especially executive orders, but in general *all* the crap that
spews from the White House.  Is there one?  Most of my searches led to
dead links.  I know that the WhiteHouse.gov site has Clinton's EO's (searchable, or,
with a little finagling, a list of them), but I want *all* of them.
I'd love to see a site which has all these things.

It's curious that they're still making this distinction.  I've got to wonder, if push came to shove, how they'd differentiate between, say, a book and a TeX document of the same book, on a CD.  Unfortunately,
the person testing this may go to prison for a long time.  I saw no
mention of prison time or fines for breaking these provisions -- I can
only assume that the teeth are buried in other Commerce regulations.
Does anyone know offhand what penalties are involved?
Also, the choice of the Commerce Department to play gatekeeper is an
interesting one, tactically.  Is the addition of a few "or import"
clauses likely?  "One small step..." as they say.
