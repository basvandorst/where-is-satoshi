@_subject: Remailer Network Under Attack 
It looks like a new round of attacks against the remailer network is
underway.  Once again, the provocation is "abuse".
Unknown persons have been using anonymous remailers and mail2news
gateways to "plant" e-mail addresses in various NGs for the
spam-bots to harvest and deluge with spam.  The original intention
appears to have been to "poison the well" for spammers by planting
addresses that they'd get in trouble for sending their junk mail to.
It appears that one or more copy-cats is now using the same
methodology to plant the addresses of people who they'd like to see
spammed.  (I'm using the term "plant" rather than "forge" since the
messages seem to contain sufficient disclaimers that the From:
addresses are not genuine.  Sufficient for a normal HUMAN reader,
but not an automated address harvester, that is.)
Within the last week or so, a chorus of complaints has arisen about
this practice, orchestrated by about a half dozen individuals who
meet an interesting criteria -- they all hold dual accounts on both
Netcom and a small ISP known as DataBasix.com.
The scenario is quite similar each time this has happened in the
past, such as with the cross-posted pro-smoking/anti-smoking threads
last year.  One of the complainers politely asks that the abusers be
identified and their abuse stop.  This is, of course, impossible
because the perpetrators are posting anonymously.  The second step,
which follows the first very closely, is a demand that the remailer
be shut down with threats being CCed to sysadmins and upstream
Given the variety of addresses being "spam baited", the only logical
target of this abuse is the remailers themselves.  Both sides of
certain heated controversies report being made the target of this
spam bait, each side accusing the other of being responsible.
The only question is whether the main group of complainers (the
Netcom/DataBasix group) are merely innocent bystanders or whether
they may have initiated the "abuse" as an excuse to shut down the
remailers in furtherance of some unknown agenda.  Either that, or
someone else is attacking the remailer net and it's just a
coincidence that a group fitting such a curious pattern (dual
accounts on the same two ISPs) should step in and demand the
dismantling of several elements of the remailer/m2n-gateway
HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION: Would mentioning the "Reichstag Fire" invoke
Godwin's Law prematurely?

hmmmm.. Go figure out how many years of your life you'll waste doing that once you calculate how many of these messages arrive each hour, let alone each day.  I, personally, have been on this mailing list for a while now, and have never seen *any* worthwhile posts from either of those remailers, or any other for that matter.  If you've got something to say, say it.  Anything less is cowardice, in one form or another.
Or, if you like, I'll remove my spam filter and you can come hit my delete key for me... [snip his cowardly key block]
[snip his cowardly anonymous signature]
Let me get this straight Mr. Cowardly Lion; if one uses a remailer, he is cowardly (in one form or another). But not an anonymous address? Not PGP?
Wise up, friend; this is cypherpunks. Some of us DO these things, and we do not have to explain ourselves to you or or anyone. Some times it's for fun; sometimes it's deadly serious.
So use the delete key; add a "filter file (;--);" do whatever you choose, but spare me the sanctimonious lecture.

"When they came for the 2nd Amendment, I said nothing, for I owned no gun
 Then the sixth was next to go, and I remained silent, as I was not on trial
 They took away the fourth, and I said nothing, as I had nothing to hide
 And then they came for the First,  and I could say nothing."

Funny thing is, if O.J. was, say, a bus-driver with food stamps, how long do you think *his* trial would be?
Besides, McVeigh's trial wasn't about truth or justice.  It was all about getting revenge, drawing blood, satisfying the bloodthirsty people of America.
McVeigh's lawyer was probably influenced (read: leaned on) by government fascists, so that McVeigh would die.
Very different from say, Atticus Finch, in "To Kill a Mockingbird".  He defended a black man, in a place and time very against that.  While this government controlled dickless loser that was McVeighs lawyer, didn't prosecute like a man, because then he'd be blacklisted and treated like shit.
If anyone out in this world feels like bumping off McVeighs lawyer, please do so.  We need less lawyers like him.

@_subject: Shooting the taggers 
There appears to be a wonderful market for long-range nonlethal
stun weapons. I wonder, if a tagger is marking your building,
would it be legal to stun him from a distance and then call the
Rape can be argued to be deserving of serious punishment of some kind,
but would tagging deserve death when a nonlethal option exist? Could
not the woman stun the rapist and then call the cops?
