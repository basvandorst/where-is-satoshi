@_subject: crypt last attempt 
Problems with mailer on last post, again; Last try.
Recently, someone posted a message which contained a chaos-based crypt routine.
How, does this compare to the one-rotor crypt routine found in (UNIX) /bin?
Which would be easier to crack, and why?
Source listings attached.  Thanks in advance, and sorry about my mail probs and
lack of experience regarding crypto (but, I am learning).
(Now, off to kill a mail tool...)
