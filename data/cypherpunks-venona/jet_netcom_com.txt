This is complete and utter nonsense.  Tim May has no clue as to what
he talks about. What's worse, it smells of homophobia.
In no particular order:
- Dworkin has never called for the banning of porn.  I've read most of
her books, and she even goes out of her way to say she's not calling
for any sort of censorship.  She *does* push for 'victim
compenstation'-style legislation.  (How this sort of legislation
interacts with constitutional rights is beyond my keen, save a few
decisions I've read about 19th century property rights in Louisiana. :-)
- I've heard Dworkin come down just has hard on lesbigay porn, if not
harder than, as she does on het porn.  Her old housemate John
Stoltenberg (sp?) is as noxious as she is on this point.
- "Yellow Silk" is not a lesbian porn mag.  It's a very lame het
softcore mag. If you'd like to see *real* lesbian porn (some of which
pisses off a fair portition of the feminist and lesbian communities)
find "On Our Backs" (started by Susie Bright), "Venus Infers" (started
by Pat Califia, women-only SM), or "Girljock" (sort of a
preppie/athelete/lesbian (not dyke :-) porn mag).
- Last I heard, there was no need to capitalize 'lesbian'. None of the
dykes/lesbians I know capitalize it, unless it starts a sentence.
Residents of Lesbos (the true 'Lesbians') might disagree, however.
Tired of white het male computer geeks talking nonsense about anyone
who threatens their place in the power structure,

That's merely a matter of passively picking up the frequencies put off
by a tv tube.  Drive down a street with a receiver/display and a list
of who paid their tv tax.  That simple.  (My dad used that sort of

@_subject: Why cypherpunks are 'stalled', IMHO 
I just got a 15k mail message from one Dave Banisar that consisted of
wire news clippings, only one of which had anything even vaguely
related to cryptogrophy.
*This* is why pepole drop off the list so often.  (Or don't show up at
meetings, thinking they'll be as noisy?).  If it's just more of the
general computer geek/privacy/libertarian stuff all over again, the
same crud that flows in such volumes on the libertarian list, and a
couple of other lists I've had the misfortune to be on, people will go
away.  (In particular, evoting, pranks to prove points, general
Let's try a little self-restraint, perhaps?  Or take discussions
off-list, or to the appropriate list?  Maybe if the list were more
hard-core crypto (and less noisy), more people would be on the list,
and more research types might be willing to be on the list.
mp-render, the massively parallel rendering list, has high content,
low volume, and some of the top folks in the biz on the list available
for discussion.  I'm sure if myself and a few other starting going on
at length about how cool Pixar's juice-box commercial was, there'd be
a lot of people unsubscribing...
Luckly, I have a mailer that supports 'kill', so I can easily blast
through multiple rounds of whether evoting is the End of the World.
:-) But I've worked with plenty of researchers (and been in the
position myself) where getting more than a few email messages a day is
a big pain in the ass.  Lots of people *doing* things don't put the
effort into making 'the net' as much a part of their lives as some of
the people here.  Hell, my boss at NASA was still reading their mail
with /bin/mail until I pointed them at elm.  Can you imagine getting
30-40 messages a day, and having to wade through them with /bin/mail?
(I watch my gf do this, I think she's nutz and on about a dozen too
many mailing lists.)
Granted, I've only made on c-punk meeting (travel and illness have
interfered with my other attempts), and the code I'm working on will
only be able to run on a machine with limited numbers (only 50 or so
built), so maybe I'm in the 'not doing so much' part.  (I'm not
immune to Off-Topic disease, either. :-)

Already happened.  The fellow used something like PGP, if not PGP, to
encrypt stuff to disk.  If I remember correctly (Mike G., help me out
here) he was asked to cough up the passwords in court as part of the
legal proceedings. (I remember this only because of the following

With UNIX it's quite simple to grep for "-----BEGIN PGP

I guess one could also run the incoming mail through a spell-checker
and reject messages with greater than %99 failure rate.
Neither of these require actual examination of the message by a human,
neither reveal content of a message to a human.

I don't think I dreamed this, but...
I remember hearing that one of the people hit by the bamse sting had
encrypted a bunch of stuff on their system.  I also remember some
discussion of whether or not the person in question could be ordered
to reveal their keys.  (Maybe I *inferred* that the person had been
ordered to reveal their keys since there was a discussion of whether
or not it was legal.)

The US Gov policy for the disposal of any media that has been used to
store classified data is:
wipe  -- demagnatize with a *massive* demag unit
grind -- toss in a thing that'd make ground chuck out of godzilla
incenerate -- at some amazingly high temperature.

Wouldn't need to be in RAM.  Would interleave the search in some banks
