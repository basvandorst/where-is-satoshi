@_subject: Looking for biblio re commercialization of encryption 
Dear Sir -- I am working on a project for NIST to develop an annotated bibliography on issues in the commercialization of encryption technology. Can you provide me with any references to EFF publications dealing with export, Clipper/Capstone, privacy, etc. ? I already have copies of the material presented at the CSS&PAB meeting at NIST but would like to have anything else that might be available. Thank you for your help!
