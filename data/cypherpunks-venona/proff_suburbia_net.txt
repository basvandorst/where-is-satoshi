I am annoyed. Matt Blaze has no obligation to produce CFS for free, let
alone a version for dummies. And boy, are you a dummy. As someone who
has hacked away at CFS for a long time now on several platforms,
including linux, I can state that the issues of porting CFS to linux
were trivial and involved a one line sed on the rpcgen output. The more
recent versions of linux don't even require this.  Further, Matt is
hardly the government/corporate lacky that you suggest him to be. Why
don't you read some of his papers before you show your technical and
social ignorance? Get a life.

Hi. Here follow the benchmark comparisons w.r.t. revisions 50 & 51. I
decided to wait before posting rev 50 before because the file read &
write results again bounced up with it, and I spent some (very little)
time trying to see if I could have done anything to cause that. With
no results, as usual. Now I also have results for the "greased
weasel", and I decided to send out my numbers for what they're
worth. Not much has changed with the latest release...
I repeat my query: if anybody has suggestions about these huge jumps in disk performance, please let me know. I am ALWAYS running the benchmark test after a reboot. I login as root, start the process in background and log out, and then generally go to sleep. The machine is NOT online, and is not doing anything important at night. I have not changed anything in the kernel config in the latest 3 revisions. I have a plain old ISA
disk controller, and two generally fullish disks, but again, the
situation did not change notably between 1.3.49 and 1.3.50.
And, I now have to admit that I find it faster, for example, to load a huge C file into emacs, and have it do the syntax coloring. I noticed it this morning. No problems in patching & compiling.

@_subject: new zip cracking code 
Does anyone have any pointers to cryptanalysis papers on the Zip
encryption scheme (presented below)? I've seen a few MSDOS executeables
which used some sort of brute force attack, which didn't seem
particularly intelligent or effective for long passwords. If anyone has
some pointers, or source I'd be glad to hear of it. From what I can see
of Schlafly's algorithm a bute force attack could be speed up a great
deal by pre-compution and expansaion of elements of the first 3 or so
rounds at the very least.
Ideas anyone?
The encryption used in PKZIP was generously supplied by Roger
Schlafly.  PKWARE is grateful to Mr. Schlafly for his expert
help and advice in the field of data encryption.
PKZIP encrypts the compressed data stream.  Encrypted files must
be decrypted before they can be extracted.
Each encrypted file has an extra 12 bytes stored at the start of
the data area defining the encryption header for that file.  The
encryption header is originally set to random values, and then
itself encrypted, using 3, 32-bit keys.  The key values are initialized using the supplied encryption password.  After each byte
is encrypted, the keys are then updated using psuedo-random number
generation techniques in combination with the same CRC-32 algorithm used in PKZIP and described elsewhere in this document.
The following is the basic steps required to decrypt a file:
1) Initialize the three 32-bit keys with the password.
2) Read and decrypt the 12-byte encryption header, further
   initializing the encryption keys.
3) Read and decrypt the compressed data stream using the
   encryption keys.
Step 1 - Initializing the encryption keys
The compressed data stream can be decrypted as follows:
loop until done
    read a charcter into C
    Temp <- C ^ decrypt_byte()
    update_keys(temp)
    output Temp
end loop

title: The Biggest Sour Grape in Marlborough
At a predetermined signal the two groups of protesters split apart. The group
I was in went round the fence to the main gates and started pushing them back
and forward making a hell of a racket. The gate was secured in three places.
We broke the top padlock and the steel rod holding the gate in the ground. We
heard a shout from the other group. They were through the fence. Nine people
arrested and many more if we didn't stop our vigorous attack on the main
This was it, we were there to do something radical, to make our protest well
and truly heard. No-one had breached the huge inner fence of the Waihopai
Spybase for years. It was my first protest at Waihopai but not the last. The
Waihopai protest just South of Blenheim is an annual event organised by the
Anti-Bases Campaign (ABC). Ever since the first survey pegs were planted in
the ground in 1987, New Zealand women (originally) and men have protested
against the existence of the secretive Waihopai Spybase. Yet despite its
colourful history the vast majority of people still don't know it exists.
Held from January 27-29 this year's protest was larger than usual. About 80
people (including an unspecified number of university students) from Dunedin
to Auckland converged on a makeshift campsite nestled beside the Wairau River
to plan what action they would take against the Spybase and all it stands for.
The word "spybase" conjures images of undercover cops, secrecy, high security,
mystery and murder. While this is a bit dramatic there are similarities. The
Waihopai base is run by the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB),
a discrete organisation which only reports to the prime minister. Hidden in a
barren valley deep in the Marlborough outback, the Waihopai base is not
something the GCSB wants New Zealanders to know about. Workers at the base
aren't allowed to talk about what they do and even their spouses don't know
how much they earn. The base has a secret budget and secret objectives.
Secrecy is the aim and so far 'they' have been successful.
That is until 6.00pm Sunday night of the protest when on TV3 thousands of
viewers saw the Waihopai Spybase for the first time. The next day articles
were published in Sunday papers, with further articles in major daily papers
on the Monday. Supportive comments by Nelson MP John Blincoe added to the
debate on a topic usually considered closed. For the first time many New
Zealanders became aware that a government agency was spying on our neighbours
in the South Pacific and giving that information straight to the United
What is a Spybase?
A more official name for the Spybase is Satellite Communications Station. This
sounds very innocent but there's no escaping the fact the base invades the
privacy of thousands of people, businesses governments and other organisations
throughout the South Pacific without their consent. The information gleamed is
not meant for the GCSB or the US, that's why it's called spying.
The base consists of an 18 metre receiving dish covered by a huge white dome,
an operations building and workshop, all protected by a 14ft security fence
backed by another electric fence, security cameras and floodlights. The base
monitors communications transmitted via satellite: private and commercial
telephone, fax, e-mail, telex and telegrams. These messages are scanned for
key words by computer. The information collected is then relayed to the GCSB
headquarters in the Freyberg building in Wellington. Useful information is
then sent to the United States National Security Agency or the larger Spybase
in Geraldton, Australia.
Why protest?
"The Waihopai Spybase uses your money to invade your privacy for other
countries' benefit?" This statement taken from an Anti-Bases Campaign pamphlet
about the base sums up the general reason why people are motivated enough to
protest, and to be arrested.
In the past, politicians like David Lange claimed the Waihopai base will give
New Zealand more independence in intelligence matters and that the information
would be under New Zealand control. However a document obtained from the US
Navy by peace researchers last year has confirmed long held suspicions that
the GCSB passes the intelligence collected at Waihopai to the powerful US
National Security Agency. This evidence completely contradicts the claims made
by New Zealand politicians. What's more, according to British investigative
journalist, Duncan Campbell, the Waihopai Spybase is part of a world wide
network of spybases monitoring satellite communications for the benefit of the
What really sticks in the throats of those who know about the Waihopai Spybase
is that despite the fact that the information is given to the US, New Zealand
pays for it. Based on the costs of similar bases in other countries, the
Anti-Bases Campaign estimates that the base cost $20 million to set up and up
to $100 million so far. Protesters ask why should we be paying for this
'service' especially when we weren't even told about it.
The Waihopai Spybase was established without the consent of the New Zealand
people and operates without the permission of the Pacific countries who's
sovereignty it intrudes on. The Spybase is part of a reliance on military
power and cold war politics which reinforces the nuclear powers domination of
the globe. Instead of building relationships with our neighbours based on
trust, cooperation and peace we are furthering the interests of oppressive
military alliances by the world super powers.
Under international law it is in fact illegal to intercept international
communications. The activities of the Waihopai Spybase contravene the
International Tele-Communications Convention to which NZ has agreed. It is
also illegal under NZ law to act on such information.
The question we must ask ourselves is "Do we want New Zealand to participate
in this misuse of technology?" "Do we want to be consulted before we enter
into secret military alliances with the super powers? Would we rather the
money spent on spying was spent on education or health? Protesters at Waihopai
demand a Parliamentary inquiry into the activities of the GCSB, and that the
activities of this organisation be subject to review by the judicial system.
We also demand the closure of the Waihopai Spybase and the redirection of the
money spent on its operations to be put toward a peaceful future. Until this
happens we will continue to protest at Waihopai. I didn't try to be unbiased
in this article. For a start I was actively protesting the base myself. It is
also difficult to get another side to the story when politicians won't talk
about it. The head of the GCSB even refused to answer MP's questions in
Parliament about the Spybase. But secrets never last forever and thanks to the
New Zealand peace movement at least some of the truth is becoming public.
The more people who demand knowledge of the Spybase and accountability for its
operations, the more likely politicians will take notice. Already Nelson MP
John Blincoe (Labour) has come out in support of the Waihopai protest. In the
Christchurch Press Blincoe said international circumstances had changed and it
was time for the "cloud of secrecy" over the base to be lifted.
"The public is entitled to know what is being done from its own soil," said
Blincoe. "At the very least there should be Parliamentary scrutiny of Waihopai
and the other listening station, Tangimoana, near Palmerston North." Yes there
are other spybases, of different sorts, but did you know about them? I find it
unnerving to think people could be listening to my phone conversations, that
foreign spy networks are operating through New Zealand and I am helping
finance something I don't believe in. But then we don't have to like it and
nor do we have to accept it. It is our right to question and protest.

1 March, 1996
At 1:50 pm today PST in the Federal Court of the USA in the State of Oregon, an Australian national Ms. Amanda Wilson was unfairly incarcerated by Justice Haggerty of the US Federal Court.
During her incaceration, she was denied legal counsel, her request to have her embassy contacted was refused
and she was informed by the Sherrif of Oregon, that she had
no rights until she was transferred to a Federal Jail.
This individual was a witness in a civil case and was
neither named as the plaintiff nor the defendant.
Work that she had performed for the plaintiff under contract was not being paid for by the Plaintiff and Ms.
Wilson was not inclined to provide the information without
her agreed remuneration.
Justice Haggerty then claimed that Ms. Wilson was an agent of Koltai Inc and Thomas P. Kotlai and that her work was
not Intellectual Property owned by herself until Ms. Wilson claimed that she had evidence that she was acting as an independent agent. Justice Haggertys' response
was that "I'm not interested in your evidence".
Justice Haggerty ordered the Sherriff to detain Ms. Wilson
for Contempt of court.
Ms. Wilson then informed the court that she had done
nothing wrong and that she was an Australian resident.
The sherriff and his assistant then handcuffed and
removed Ms. Wilson to the holding cells on level four of the
Federal Courthouse in Portland.
She requested leave to contact her embassy. This was refused. She requested the right to counsel, this also was
refused. She then requested that the sherriffs office  contact her parents in Australia to notify them of her
arrest. The sherriff refused this request.
She was then photographed, finger printed and informed that she would be removed to a jail later that afternoon if she did not comply with the courts order to divulge the passwords giving Ausnet Services Pty. Ltd. free access to her Intelectual Property.
Justice Haggerty then visited Ms. Wilson in the holding cells to counsel her.
Ms. Wilson requested from Judge Haggerty that she be allowed
to contact her father and/or the Australian Embassy.
Justice Haggerty declined this request.
Ms. Wilson then gave into the pressure applied and gave
the passwords required by Justice Haggerty.
During her three hours and fifteen minutes of incarceration
Ms. Wilson was humiliated with a personal body search.
Threatened with transport to a jail in California.
Informed that she had no rights and was generally verbally
and mentally abused.
Under USC 28, 1603, (B)(3) Ms. Wilson is an alien and the US
Federal court has no jurisdiction over her.
It is the opinion of this individual that the US Federal
Court has exceeded its authority and has failed to recognise
the civil rights of an Australian National.

WHEN YOU HAVE SUBSCRIBED
    The growing infusion of computers and computing devices into society
    created a legislative and common law vacuum in the 1980's. State
    prosecutors attempted to apply traditional property protection and
    deception laws to new technological crimes. By and large they were
    successful in this endeavor. There were however a very few but well
    publicized failed cases against computer "hackers" (notably R vs
    Gold - UK House of Lords and the E911 case). To the informed, these
    cases demonstrated not so much a legislation vacuum, but prosecution
    incompetence in choosing which statute to lay charges under and
    mis-management by prosecuting cases where the real offence of the
    defendant was merely the embarrassment of the powerful.
    In an atmosphere of increased government reliance on computer
    databases and public fear and hostility towards computerization of
    the workplace, legislatures rushed to criminalise certain types of
    computer use.  Instead of expanding the scope of existing
    legislation to more fully encompass the use of computers by
    criminals, changing phrases such as "utter or write" to "utter,
    write or transmit" (the former being the prosecutions undoing in the
    well publicized Gold case) as had been done with the computerization
    of copyright law, an entirely new class of criminal conduct was was
    introduced. The computer had been seen not just as another tool that
    criminals might use in committing a crime but something altogether
    foreign and removed from the rest of society and established Law.
    The result was a series of naively drafted, overly broad and
    under-defined statutes which criminalised nearly all aspects of
    computer use under certain conditions.
    In the early 1990's a fundamental and evolving shift in computer
    usage started to occur. Now, it is rare to see a white collar worker
    in the work-place without the possession of a computer. In western
    countries such as Australia, over one third of households have
    computer systems. The computer is no longer the "altogether foreign
    and removed from the rest of society" device it once was. It has
    come out of the domain of the technical specialist and into the main
    stream.
    Even our notoriously slow moving legal profession is adopting it as
    an essential tool. But there is another change. A qualitative one
    important to our discussion.
    When you link hundreds of thousands of computers together and thus
    the people that use them together you find something remarkable
    occurs.  An event that you could never have predicted by merely
    summing the discrete components involved. A unique virtual society
    forms. Despite being designed with computer networking in mind,
    computer crime legislation copes very poorly with non homogeneous
    authorization [i.e partial authorization].
    Societies are based around a common knowledge of history, beliefs,
    and current events. Each member of a society can be pinpointed as
    belonging to the society in question by the ideas, beliefs and
    knowledge held in common with other societal members. Any new member
    to a society learns this knowledge only because it is passed onto
    them; directly by other members or indirectly via its media, works of
    literature, music and art.
    Successful large scale computer networks like the Internet form for
    one reason and one reason only; information sharing. When a critical
    mass of diversity, interests, user population and information
    exchange is reached, a situation develops that mirrors in all
    important aspects a vibrant and evolving society. Citizens of the
    Internet have a nearly equal sized voice with which to convey their
    thoughts to other members and can do so quickly and without unwanted
    distortion. This is a remarkably democratic process compared to the
    very real _self_ censorship and top heavy direction that is so
    manifest in traditional broadcast and publishing industries.
    But unlike the physical societies that have here-to been the norm,
    the electronic network society is remarkably non-isolationist. It
    continues to draw from, mesh and feed its beliefs into the
    traditional societies it was populated out of. This coupling process
    between computer network and traditional societies will continue
    (at least for English speaking countries -- the cultural barriers
    imposed by primary language differences are non-trivial) until a
    stage is reached where the boundary between the two is blurred and
    intangible.
    Most citizens will then fall under the rule of appallingly drafted
    computer crimes legislation every day of their lives. In the vast
    majority of such legislation directed to address computer crime
    everything which can be performed on a computer unless "authorized"
    is defined as illegal. One might think that an individual could
    authorize themselves to do anything they wished with their own
    computer [not so, as France and Russia and the USA have demonstrated
    with anti-cryptography and other information processing and content
    laws] given their ownership of it.
    But how does the Law define this "ownership"? Does ownership of the
    "chattel" (CPU, memory, disks and other hardware) imply ownership of
    the information created on it?  What about employees with "partial
    authorization" [examine disturbing outcome of Intel employee
    R.Swartz vs the State of Oregon 1995]? If the user of the computer
    system isn't the chattel owner, but has been given full control over
    it does this imply they are authorized for all interaction with the
    data stored on it?  Is there such thing as implicit authorization?
    Can an operating system grant authorization (implicit or otherwise)
    as an authorized agent of the owner/operator? If not, is sending
    electronic mail to someone who doesn't want their computer system to
    receive it "unauthorized insertion of data"?
    In a networked topology a typical computer user may use or otherwise
    interact with hundreds or even thousands of other peoples computers
    in any given day. What is then the analogous "authorization
    topology"?  In Law it has previously been the case that which was
    not expressly forbidden was generally permitted.  Currently the
    digital equivalent of moving a chair [modification of trivial data]
    in someone else's office is illegal and carries with it in most
    countries a 5 to 10 year prison term. It is a sad reflection on the
    legislature of the day that the computer _medium_ was criminalised
    rather than the intent or damage caused to the victim.
    It is unlikely that law reform will occur until current political
    concern over computer networks such as the Internet is moderated. If
    anything the push so far from political drafters has being to once
    again introduce brand new medium criminalising legislation rather
    than revitalizing the existing codes. This unfortunate "labeled
    arrow" approach will continue as long as there exists an ill
    informed and technologically ignorant legislature that finds itself
    pliant to the whims of sensationalist media and honed to their
    dubious targets. Strong ideals do not equal strong policy.
    So ill defined and over broad are the terms used in most computer
    crime legislation that typically the pressing of a button on a
    silicon wrist watch without permission can be construed as
    "insertion of data into a computer without authority" an offense
    which carries 10 years penalty in countries such as Australia. The
    farse inherent is blatant. Surely the process going on within the
    wrist watch is utterly irrelevant. Victemless crimes should be
    avoided if at all possible. If interfering with the watch caused
    damage, even if that damage was to the intellectual property in the
    watch then the crime is one of Criminal Damage [or one of the other
    broad ranging damage statutes, depending on jurisdiction]. If
    changing the internal state of the watch led to fraud or theft, then
    the crime should be one of fraud or theft (possibly by deception).
    If pressing the button changed, for instance, the time of the watch
    and this lead to a death, then the crime should be that of
    manslaughter or murder. Actions that do not damage (or other wise
    attempt to negatively effect) the life of human beings directly, or
    indirectly by damage or loss of property or fundamental societal
    ideals (such as the right to privacy, freedom of association, speech
    & movement) should not be crimes. Actions that annoy but do not
    damage should also not be crimes, and traditionally are not. Crimes
    and the criminal process are serious. Annoyances by definition are
    not.
    In most Commonwealth countries physical trespass [despite the
    general view] is not a crime and with good reason. The Criminal law
    system wasn't intended to be the citizen's lacky and enforcer of
    personal whim, but rather to protect persons from genuine harm and
    preserve social order and the sovereign. Someone trespassing on your
    lands may annoy you. It may contradict your authorization. But it
    [typically] only becomes illegal when you ask the trespasser to
    leave and they refuse, or if their trespassing was directly
    associated with the commission or attempted commission of an offence.
    It is with this lack of appropriate legislation, precedents and
    judicial guidance that judiciary, practitioners, prosecutors, law
    enforcement personnel, defendants and drafters of future codes &
    policy have to struggle to find resolution.
    This list has been created in an attempt to mitigate the lack of
    tangible resources people involved with computer crime have at their
    disposal. It is hoped that by bringing together knowledgeable legal
    professionals together with para-legal personnel and informed lay
    persons that information and resources relevant to the difficult
    task of analyzing, presenting in court, formulating departmental or
    company policy or otherwise dealing with computer crime law and
    computer crimes may be shared and intelligent discussion and law
    reform stimulated.

The suburbia.net administrators kindly invite you to attend to the
Church of Scientology Demonstration at:
For those completely unfamiliar with the Church of Scientology [CoS]'s
attack upon the Internet and RRR radio station and critical speech
generally, read my below summary and the the appended transcript of one
of our users [David Gerard ] from JJJ radio station.
The Church of Scientology was founded by the late L. Ron Hubbard in the
United States some 30 years ago. To followers, Hubbard is their profit,
and his prolific writings are the sacred word. The Church's hierarchy
and financial viability revolve around Hubburd's verbose scriptures.
Each new level gained by a church follower brings to them, among other
rights and privileges access to a new and previously verboten set of the
works of Ron.  But to the Church it brings something else. Revenue. A
very sizeable revenue. Ron's works are a required element in order for
the follower to progress through the many of successive levels the
Church has -- and they cost hundreds or thousands of dollars each. In
fact, by the time a devote of the Church has realized the highest OT
level, the Church has usually had them for over five figures. But
revenue isn't the only reason for keeping the works of Ron occulted
A common technique used by cults to brainwash their followers is gradual
immersion in cult mythology and philosophy. To put it bluntly, it is
often advisable to keep the more wacko beliefs and practices out of your
new recruit's faces until they are sufficiently wacko themselves.  Now,
the problem for the Church of Scientology is that on the wacko scale the
higher level works of Ron hover somewhere near the figure 10. To an
outsider it is an immediate farse. But to a follower who has become
psychologically dependent on the Church's philosophy & society and
invested thousands and thousands of dollars in doing so, it is just
another step on the road to mental subservience.
What you have then is a Church based on brainwashing yuppies and other
people with more money than sense. This may not concern you. If Nicole
Kiddman, Kate Cerbrano, John Travolta, Burce Willis, Demi Moor and Tom
Cruise want to spend their fortunes on learning that the earth is in
reality the destroyed prison colony of aliens from out of space then so
be it. However, money brings power and attracts the currupt. Money is
something the Church has a lot of.  Not all of the Church's beliefs and
practices are so out of it as to be completely as irrelevant as the
previous example. Some are quite insidious. For instance, L. Ron Hubbard
devised a range of methods that could be used against critics and other
`enemies of the Church'. Among the list was manipulation of the
legal/court system. To the Church the battle isn't won in the court
room. It is won at the very moment the legal process starts unfolding,
creating fear and expense in those the Church opposes.  Their worst
critic at the moment is not a person, or an organisation but a medium --
the Internet. The Internet is, by its very nature a censorship free
zone. Censorship, concealment and revelation (for a fee) is the Church's
raison d'etre.
The Church, via its manipulation of the legal system has had computer
systems seized, system operators forced to reveal their users personal
details, university accounts suspended and radio stations, such as RRR
cut their programs. It has sued ex-cult members, newspapers, and many
others for copyright infringements, loss of earnings and trade secret
violation. Trade secret violation? Yes, the Church of Scientology
claims its religious works are trade secrets.
The fight against the Church is far more than the Net vs a bunch of
wackos with too much money. It is about corporate suppression of
the Internet and free speech. It is about intellectual property and
the big and rich versus the small and smart. The precedents the
Church sets today the weapons of corporate tirany tomorrow.

   DAVID GERARD ON 3-CR (855KHZ AM) MELBOURNE, 8:50AM THU 14 MAR 1996
   ANNOUNCER: There's currently a war going on on the Internet,
   especially in relation to the Church of Scientology. This morning on
   the line is David Gerard. Good morning, David.
   DAVID: Good morning.
   A: First of all, can you tell me what, what the war is that's going
   on on the Internet?
   D: Well, OK. There's a newsgroup on the Internet called
   alt-dot-religion-dot-scientology, ARS. For a few years, this was like
   one of the thousands of backwater Internet newsgroups. A newsgroup's
   a sort of area with a given name where anyone can put a message on,
   read other people's messages, that sort of thing; it's distributed
   world-wide, there's no central control over it, so ...
   A: So it's sort of like an electronic noticeboard, where you can put
   up whatever you feel like.
   D: Yep. Free access. And, y'know, most of them are utter garbage and
   there's no way anyone's interested in all thousands of them. And it
   was like a little backwater religion newsgroup for many years, where
   you have a few Church people and a few critics sniping at each other,
   y'know, and no-one else was really interested. But then, there was an
   ex-Scientologist on there, a guy called Dennis Erlich, who ...
   Someone put on a message saying, "is this actually part of secret
   Scientology scripture?" It was a particularly wacky thing about 'find
   some plants and see If you can communicate with them and see if they
   receive your communication.' And he verified, 'yes, that's the real
   thing.' In verifying it, he quoted it. So what the Church of
   Scientology then did, seeing as they have tended in dealing with
   critics to have the subtlety of a Mack truck, what they did was, they
   got a judge to write a copyright violation writ. And they went round
   and raided his house, and took away his computers, and went through
   his house, and took anything they felt like. This is a good way to
   piss of thirty million people in one go. And the Internet sort of
   rose up as one to strike back at these people. So what happened was,
   in their attempts to quash all discussion and quash all criticism,
   they earned themselves a whole lot more critics. I mean, I'm not an
   ex-Scientologist, I have no interest in them, except that they're
   trying to use legal thuggery, corporate financing, to try to quash
   all dissent. Thankfully they're doing it very badly. They're losing
   cases left, right and centre when they get them into court, and the
   publicity has been very damaging for them.
   A: So there's obviously more than one legal case going on. How many
   people have they prosecuted, or how many people are they in the
   process of charging?
   D: Well, there was Dennis Erlich in America; Lawrence Wollersheim and
   Bob Penny, who are also ex- Scientologists -- they ran a computer
   bulletin-board called FACTNet, which contains information on all
   forms of cults and restrictive groups like those, and Arnie Lerma,
   who was an ex-Scientologist. And after Lerma was raided, someone in
   Holland put the thing which he had posted, the Fishman Affidavit,
   which contains quotes from the Scientology scriptures, someone in the
   Netherlands put it on a Web page -- on a World Wide Web page, the
   thing you get through Netscape and so on. And in magazines where you
   see the Internet, they usually have a screen shot from Netscape --
   and what happened was, they tried raiding the Internet provider in
   Holland, and the Dutch people were outraged with this and promptly
   there were a hundred different copies of it all over Holland. And
   then they tried mounting a case against them, and it just came in,
   word came in a few days ago that they lost.
   A: So is the Church of Scientology actually using the Internet to
   display information, or to put out information about the positive
   sides of the Church, or the sort of information that they would use
   to draw people in?
   D: Yeah, they finally got their own Web server up, but the point is
   ... And that's fine. The more information the better. The critics
   have their information up, and the Church is trying to stop that, but
   they're having a lot of trouble, because basically, once
   information's out there, you can't put the genie back in the bottle,
   you can't squeeze the toothpaste back into the tube. They feel that
   if people find out about their secret scriptures, they might think
   that they're very silly and laugh at them and not want to be
   Scientologists. And also when things like the prices of these things
   come out, like when you discover you've paid a hundred and sixty
   thousand US dollars to learn that Xenu the galactic dictator took
   people to Earth seventy-five million years ago, strapped them to
   volcanoes and blew them up, and that you've paid this much money for
   that and you're supposed to believe it.
   A: Well, you'd want to believe it after paying all that money.
   D: Well, actually, that's exactly it. The further people get in, the
   more fanatical they seem to be. Experts on cults say that the Church
   of Scientology is one of the hardest cults to get people back to the
   real world from. And you have that cognitive dissonance between 'this
   is a load of rubbish' and 'I've paid hundreds of thousands of dollars
   and worked for years for this.'
   A: Probably fits into the same philosophy that once you've paid a lot
   of money for a car, it's the best car there is. [laughs]
   D: Something like that. Yeah. And the issue goes beyond the Church of
   Scientology. I mean, they're weird and vicious, and this is
   well-documented, and if they care to object to me making that
   statement I'll back it up in court if they like ...
   A: Is this a fairly typical scenario on the Internet? Are there other
   groups who are behaving in this manner, or is it a fairly limited ...
   D: Well, at first only the Scientologists tried this, but, um, the
   Unification Church, Reverend Moon's lot, have recently been trying
   this, there's another small cult called Eckankar which is descended
   from a church which is descended from Scientology, have recently been
   trying this as well. It's quite amazing. It's not an issue of
   Scientology, it's not an issue of Scientology teachings, it's an
   issue of the corporate behaviour in the world where they attempt to
   silence critics by using legal bigfooting, money ... Can small people
   criticise big corporations or big financial interests?
   A: I guess in some ways it's very similar to the McDonalds case in
   Britain, where they're suing two unemployed people as this huge
   corporation.
   D: And the same thing is happening: it's backfiring on them.
   A: Yeah.
   D: 'Cos the thing about the Internet is, you can't stop the
   information going out, because if you make something restricted,
   suddenly everybody wants it. They've tried suing one person in
   Holland, a hundred more sprung up. They've tried getting their
   critics pulled off the Internet altogether -- my University Internet
   account was locked for two months because of the Church of
   Scientology, so I then went out and got a private provider. Their
   behaviour is ... it's intolerable in a multicultural society, where
   the implicit rule is we all have to get along.
   A: I understand that a similar thing has happened to the 'Liars'
   Club', a show put together by the Skeptics on 3-RRR.
   D: Yep. The Church spent about ... a few years trying to shut down
   the 'Liars' Club', 'cos they dared to mention, criticise Scientology.
   And they finally got it taken to the Australian Broadcasting
   Authority, who ruled that a particular show, where they had an
   ex-Scientologist called Cyril Vosper ... that he went on and he
   talked about the Church and what he didn't like about it and what was
   bad about it. And he knows his stuff, he's been there, he actually
   knew L. Ron Hubbard, that sort of thing.
   A: Is this L. Ron Hubbard the science fiction author?
   D: Yes, the guru of Scientology, the source of everything in
   Scientology. Every word he wrote is taken by them as scripture.
   A: [laugh] I've read his books and thought they were novels! [laughs]
   D: Ha, well, yeah, pretty well ... But anyway, Vosper went on, and
   the Tribunal ruled that no word or sentence that Vosper said was
   religious vilification, no word or sentence that Adam Joseph,
   presenter, said was vilification, no word or sentence that Vanda
   Hamilton, the other presenter, said was vilification, but, because
   the presenters agreed with the guest, it was therefore vilification.
   Now, they didn't ask RRR to pull the show, but RRR pulled the show.
   They also didn't give them any due process in pulling the show; if a
   show's in danger of being pulled, y'know, you give them the chance to
   speak. Stephen Walker just killed it.
   A: Actually, you're holding a demonstration, that's right.
   D: It's a small thing, where we politely state our case and hand out
   leaflets, it's outside the Church, corner Russell Street and Flinders
   Lane, on Saturday morning at 11am.
   A: So you'll be providing people who turn up with leaflets to hand
   out?
   D: Yep. We'll have hundreds of leaflets, we'll have a few signs ...
   We expect it to be a very polite demonstration. We had one in
   September last year, we politely stated our case, the Church people
   had a leaflet of their own, that sort of thing. It was ...
   A: [laughs] That's all very nice!
   D: It's all about ... It's not to do with the local people, I mean,
   the individual people are fine. We're talking about management
   actions in America. It's a multinational organisation.
   A: Anyway, we've got to go. Thanks very much for your time, David.
   D: Thank you very much.
   A: See you later. That was Dave Gerard talking about the war on the
   Internet and the way that the Church of Scientology is ... taking
   action against people who publish information which is negative about
   the Church. You've been listening to Thursday Breakfast, it's now two
   minutes past nine, we've gone over time, and we'll catch you again
   next week. It's time for 'Scheherazade'.

Oh, I don't know. The remote satalite imaging lab in reston has been known
for sometime now to have enough resolution to look down a good clean
cleavege, and certainly their perspective is vertical enough.
I've thought about this as well. You could also use the IP TOS minimise-cost
bit, which is defunct, doesn't require IP options, is included in every
packet and in most modern unix's and rfc1122 complient TCP/IP protocol
interface stacks can be set at user level with a simple setsockopt() call.
That said, it has a granularity of one.
To my mind, it is value judgement, and a difficult one at that to decide
when information is appropriate or otherwise for a given age group. A
given community may feel the age of maturity is something other than 18, and
physiologically the age of maturity is different for differing racial groups.
It is a strange world where it is permissible to get married at 16 -- and
all that implies, but not permissible to think freely until 18, or 21 in
certain states.
More appropriate would be content flags. Using the security option there is
a resonable number that could be assigned. OPT_R_UPPER_NUDITY,
OPT_R_LOWER_NUDITY, OPT_R_FULL_NUDITY, OPT_R_FEMALE, OPT_R_MALE, OPT_R_BIZARRE,
OPT_R_HOMOSEXUAL, OPT_R_BESTIALITY, OPT_R_DISECTION, OPT_R_INTERCOURSE, OPT_R_VIOLENCE and OPT_R_ADVERTISING come to mind. Unlike TOS however, many IP stacks
have no real support for the security option. The value of re-using it then
for this purpose it dubious. There is no reason another IP option couldn't
be added. Perhaps the spare TOS bit could be used as a catch-all until
a content option is implimented.
Most french wouldn't be concerned about OPT_R_FULL_NUDITY provided
OPT_R_HOMOSEXUAL wasn't set.

Make a grey-scale cable by merging the RGB lines (AND the RGB return lines).
Do not use a standard grey scale cable, these are typically intensity on
green, which you do not want.
Connect the cable and start playing with your colour scheme. The effect you
want to achieve is one where all colours have the same intensity. When that
happens your whole screen should be the a uniform grey area. Revert to the
regular cable and save your palette configuration.
I imagine this would be effective against all of the middle range
van-eck monitoring equipment. It will not be effective against equipment
that looks for phase distortion and signatures in an attempt to
discriminate against the three signals.  Equipment capable of the latter
would be extremely complicated and expensive to design and produce; I
suspect there has been no call for it to date, given that if you are
dealing with a target who understands the risks of van-eck they usually
have shielding and or a faraday cage.

Varying the colours does not reduce RF radiation. It just obfuscates it
by making the radation given off by the three colour beems and their
cables equal in extant (at least, far more equal). Remember the
Black button on the Black console in the Black ship that lights up Black?

Paris, May 23, 1996: There is an EC regulation called which applies to

This restricts the use of cryptography in the context of weapons of

export licensing requirement which is similar in scope. France, on
the other hand, has much wider restrictions.  The EC regulation is
"Dual-Use and Related Goods (Export Control) Regulations" and the UK
is "Export of Goods (Control) Order".

[Tuesday, 07 May 96 08:30:54 EST, "jean-bernard condat"       Art. 12
      Article  28  of  the  Law No. 90-1170 dated December 29, 1990, on
      telecommunications regulation is hereby amended as follows:
      I - Section I is hereby amended as follows:
      1)  The  first  paragraph  shall  be  completed  by the following
      phrase: "Secret coding method denotes all materials  or  programs
      conceived or modified for the same purpose."
      2)  The  second  and  third paragraphs are hereby replaced by the
      following provisions:
      "To  preserve  the interests of national defense and the internal
      or  external  security  of  the  State,  while   permitting   the
      protection   of   information   and  the  development  of  secure
      communications and transactions,
      1) the use of a secret coding method or service shall be:
      a) allowed freely:
      -  if  the  secret  coding  method  or service does not allow the
      assurance of confidentiality, particularly when it  can  only  be
      used  to  authenticate a communication or ensure the integrity of
      the transmitted message;
      -  or  if  the  method or the service assures confidentiality and
      uses only coding conventions managed according to the  procedures
      and  by  an organization approved under the conditions defined in
      Section II;
      b)  subject  to  the authorization of the Prime Minister in other
      cases.
      2)  the  supply,  importation from countries not belonging to the
      European Community, and exportation of secret coding  methods  as
      well as services:
      a)  shall  require  the prior authorization of the Prime Minister
      when they assure confidentiality; the authorization  may  require
      the supplier to reveal the identity of the purchaser;
      b) shall require declaration in other cases."
      3)  A decree sets the conditions under which the declarations are
      signed and the authorizations  approved.   This  decree  provides
      for:
      a)  a  simplified  system  of  declaration  or  authorization for
      certain types of methods or services or for certain categories of
      users;
      b) the substitution of the declaration for the authorization, for
      transactions concerning secret coding methods or  services  whose
      technical  characteristics or conditions of use, while justifying
      a certain attention being paid with regard to the  aforementioned
      interests,  do  not  require  the  prior  authorization  of these
      transactions;
      c)   the   waiver  of  all  prior  formalities  for  transactions
      concerning secret coding  methods  or  services  whose  technical
      characteristics   or   conditions   of  use  are  such  that  the
      transactions are not capable of damaging the interests  mentioned
      at the beginning of this paragraph.
      II - Section II is hereby replaced by the following provisions:
      "II  -  Organizations  responsible  for  managing,  on  behalf of
      others, the coding  conventions  for  secret  coding  methods  or
      services  that  allow  the  assurance  of confidentiality must be
      approved in advance by the Prime Minister.
      They  are  obligated  to maintain professional confidentiality in
      the exercise of their approved activities.
      The approval shall specify the methods and services that they may
      use or supply.
      They shall be responsible to preserve the coding conventions that
      they manage. Within the framework of application of the  Law  No.
      91-646  dated  July  10,  1991, concerning the confidentiality of
      correspondence  sent  via  telecommunications,  and  within   the
      framework  of investigations made under the rubric of Articles 53
      et seq. and 75 et seq. of the Code of  Criminal  Procedure,  they
      must  release  them  to  judicial  authorities  or  to  qualified
      authorities, or implement them according to their request.
      They must exercise their activities on domestic soil.
      A  decree in the Council of State sets the conditions under which
      these organizations shall be approved, as well as the  guarantees
      which the approval shall require; it specifies the procedures and
      the  technical  provisions  allowing  the  enforcement   of   the
      obligations indicated above.
      III  -  a)  Without  prejudice  to the application of the Customs
      Code, the  fact  of  supplying,  importing  from  a  country  not
      belonging  to  the  European  Community,  or  exporting, a secret
      coding method or  service,  without  having  obtained  the  prior
      authorization mentioned in I or in violation of the conditions of
      the  granted  approval,  shall  be  punishable  by   six   months
      imprisonment and a fine of FF 200,000.
      The fact of managing, on behalf of others, the coding conventions
      for secret coding methods or services that allow the assurance of
      confidentiality,  without  having obtained the approval mentioned
      in II or in violation of the conditions of this approval,  shall
      be punishable by two years imprisonment and a fine of FF 300,000.
      The  fact of supplying, importing from a country not belonging to
      the European Community, or exporting, a secret coding  method  or
      service,  in order to facilitate the preparation or commission of
      a felony or misdemeanor,  shall  be  punishable  by  three  years
      imprisonment and a fine of FF 500,000.
      The  attempt to commit the infractions mentioned in the preceding
      paragraphs shall be punishable by the same penalties.
      b)  The natural persons guilty of the infractions mentioned under
      a) shall  incur  the  complementary  penalties  provided  for  in
      Articles   131-19,   131-21,  and  131-27,  as  well  as,  either

      131-38 of the Criminal Code;
      2)  the penalties mentioned in the Article L.  131-39 of the same
      code. The prohibition mentioned in 2) of this article  L.  131-39
      concerns  activities,  during  the  exercise  of which, or on the

      obstructing the progress of the investigations mentioned in  this
      section  IV, shall be punishable by six months imprisonment and a
      fine of FF 200,000."
      IV - Section IV becomes V.
      After the word "authorizations," the words "and declarations" are
      hereby inserted.
      V - A section VI is hereby added, formulated as follows:
      "VI  -  The  provisions  of  this  article  shall  not hinder the
      application of the Decree dated April 18, 1939, establishing  the
      regulation of war materials, arms, and munitions, to those secret
      coding methods which are specially conceived or modified to allow
      or facilitate the use or manufacture of arms."

  ---------------
In trying to analyze the impact of the proposed law, I would note
the following:
Section I:
Paragraph 1 (a), first bullet, seems to explicitly allow digital
signatures, and does not require that the secret keys used for such
purposes be escrowed.
Paragraph 1 (a), second bullet, in combination with Section II,
strongly hints at a requirement for key escrow. Conceivably,
depending on the details of Law No 91-646 dated July 10, 1991
concerning the confidentiality of correspondence sent via
telecommunications, the use of short keys that might expose
information to unauthorized individuals (a la the IBM masked DES
and Lotus Notes solution) might even be prohibited!
Paragraph 1 (b) provides an escape clause for certain favored
activities (and/or organizations?). Presumably international
standards such as Visa/MasterCard's SET, which apply strong
confidentiality to only certain data fields, notably the
cardholders account number, would be permitted under this kind of
an exception.  Banking transactions and other sensitive information
may also be excluded from the key escrow requirement, especially if
(since) the Government could subpoena the bank's records directly.
This is further borne out by paragraph 3, (a, b, and c).
Paragraph 1 seems to apply to the use of encryption, as opposed to
the supply, import, or export. However, unless such use is covered
by Law No. 91-646, the proposed amendment does not seem to apply
criminal or civil penalties to such use.
Paragraph 2 is interesting, in that it differentiates between
"supply" and "importing from countries not belonging to the
European community". This may be a techni-cality of the European
Community import/export laws -- perhaps importation from countries
within the European Community no longer has any meaning, since such
customs barriers were supposed to have been removed. I would
interpret "supply" to include the offering for sale, or even
distributing for free, such code, even by a French citizen. This
would therefore appear to apply to the (re-)distribution of PGP
and/or any home-grown French products, as well as any encryption
products originating within the EC. If so, this would seem to be
more even-handed with respect to imports from the US and elsewhere
than might otherwise appear, and may obviate any claim that the law
would violate the World Trade Organization's Most Favored Nation
agreements. The apparent import preference for EC products simply
reflect's France's obligation to allow the free flow of goods
within the EC.
Paragraph 3 seems to provide for some simplified administrative
mechanisms that may be less onerous than a case by case review. IN
US terms, this may be similar to requesting a commodity
jurisdiction from Commerce, rather than having encryption being
construed as following under the ITARs. If so, we should certainly
investigate these options. Subparagraphs b and c may apply to the
use of relatively short keys, or for transactions of limited scope,
e.g., for SET.
Section II defines conditions for establishing and approving escrow
agencies.  Given the requirement for "professional
confidentiality", I would not be at all surprised if the civil law
"notaires" didn't jump at the chance to get into this business.
The requirement that they exercise their activities on French soil
is rather obscure.  The prior language doesn't explicitly say that
anything about escrow, nor where the escrowed keys must be
maintained -- it only talks about the management of coding
conventions, and the requirement to comply with the requirements of
the Code of Civil Procedure, which presumably requires that they
divulge the keys and/or the text of any confidential messages upon
demand by a proper authority. But a literal reading of the text
would suggest that a standards organization that manages and
preserves the coding conventions would have to carry out their
activities on French soil, while the escrow repository might be
Section III certainly makes it clear that they are serious about
all this.  The natural persons who have committed, or even
attempted to commit acts in violation of the Act are subject to
fines and imprisonment, and I would hazard a guess that the
Articles 131-33 and 131-34 would debar them from participating in
any future importing or exporting.
Corporations (judicial persons) may be held criminally responsible
for any infractions caused by their employees, and I would assume
that Article 131-39 would also lead to a debarment for future
import or export, in exactly the same manner as US export
violations would.
Section VI makes the Act applicable to overseas territories, which
means that some of the more obscure areas and countries would also
be covered, such as French Guiana, etc.
Disclaimer: I am not a French attorney, nor someone who is at all
knowledgeable about EC law. The preceding analysis should not be
construed as any kind of an official position.  Go get your own
hired guns if you need advice!

NEWARK, N.J. -- The Associated Press reported today that drivers
may soon be using a new high-tech driver's license to pay tolls and
do banking in New Jersey. The soon to be tested  "Smart Card" will
carry a data packed computer chip that will provide authorities
with access to private information including fingerprints and
medical records.
The pilot cards will be limited to standard driver's license
information. By the time the cards are issued to all New Jersey
drivers in July 1997, they would also contain fingerprints and an
"electronic purse" to be used to pay bus and train fares, the AP
Civil libertarians said the new licenses raise privacy concerns.  Ultimately, the AP said, the license will contain arrest records,
medical records, vehicle registration, and could be used as a debit
card to pay for groceries and do banking.
"I think citizens should be extremely scared about loss of
privacy," David Rocah of the New Jersey ACLU told AP. "They could
store tax data. They could store medical data. They could store
driver's records, insurance data, virtually any data in the
government's possession."
The ACLU also warned that the potential for misuse of the
information --government surveillance or telemarketing research -
- could pose potential problems.

Next security test: GOP's convention
Even before the Atlanta bombing, San Diego had battened down for
the Republican s' meeting.
By Carol Morello
INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
 SAN DIEGO  -- For all the festive bunting and wacky elephants
springing up around town, the Republican National Convention will
open here in a grim atmosphere of no-nonsense security.
 With a week left to go, Harbor Street, six lanes sweeping past the
convention center, already has been closed to traffic. Owners of
boats docked in the marina adjoining the center have been notified
that their vessels will be swept and boarded for ``consensual
 Tall chain-link fences ring the convention center itself. But
metal detectors like the ones the delegates will pass through were
deemed too unwieldy for the parking lot across the street, where
65 protest groups have been assigned carefully choreographed time
slots. Instead, a sign at the entrance will advise that satchels
and backpacks may be searched, and police have leased 200 pieces
of high-tech equipment to detect firearms and explosives.
 Police also have gathered floor plans and photographs of every
hotel and party site where delegates will be lodged and feted, all
considered potential targets. They have even pressed the Retired
Senior Citizens Patrol into service, and encouraged abortion
doctors to ``take a vacation.''
 Authorities in Chicago, where the Democrats will meet the last
week of August, are taking similar precautions. Metal detectors,
bomb-sniffing dogs and surveillance cameras will be in force, along
with thousands of police. Coast Guard cutters will patrol Lake
Michigan. Chicago police are sealing an eight-block area around the
United Center sports arena, the main convention site, to all
unauthorized cars, trucks and pedestrians.  As the 20th century
nears an end, wary, pervasive security is as much a part of the
convention scene as Old Glory and silly hats. San Diego has been
preparing convention security for more than a year. Then a bomber
on the other side of the country suddenly made everyone wonder if
the next big public event could be free of mayhem and terror.
 In an emergency meeting called the day after a pipe bomb exploded
at the Olympics in Atlanta, convention security planners assured
Mayor Susan Golding that plans already in place were adequate. They
said they neither made, nor expect to make, any significant
changes. They have devised more than 100 scenarios that could
threaten a peaceful convention, from an earthquake to a building
collapse to a bomb like the one that twisted Atlanta's moment of
 Carl Truscott, head of convention security for the Secret Service,
said he had reached a ``comfort level'' for security within the
center itself. His agents are conducting sweeps of the 800 to 1,000
sites around San Diego County where party potentates will appear.
But he said the sweeps began before Atlanta's bombing.  ``It
certainly raised our awareness level and concern,'' said Capt. Dave
Bejarano, head of the San Diego Police Department's convention
security planning unit, which is coordinating the deployment of law
enforcement from 18 different agencies. ``But we've made no
significant changes. We'll just be more proactive. We're planning
for the worst-case scenario, and hoping for the best.''
 After two failed bids, San Diego fought hard for this moment in
the sun. But even before it's begun the clouds are out.
 Television networks and party poo-bahs have groused about the
convention center's puny dimensions. Protesters went to court to
guarantee a demonstration zone where delegates can hear and see
them after the Republicans tried to shuffle them down the street.
 With equal amounts of anticipation and trepidation, San Diegans
are prepared to host 50,000 visitors who can charitably be
described as intense  -- 8,000 conventioneers, 12,000 media
representatives and tens of thousands of protesters. They know the
GOP gathering will showcase this city of 1.2 million people more
than all previous events held here, from the Super Bowl to the
World Series.
 Twice before, San Diego was an also-ran in the convention
sweepstakes. In 1972, the convention that nominated Richard Nixon
to a second term was moved to Miami when a leaked memo by ITT
lobbyist Dita Beard disclosed that the Justice Department dropped
an antitrust lawsuit against the corporation after it donated
$400,00 to the San Diego convention campaign. And in 1992,
Republicans encouraged the city to make a costly bid, only to pick
Houston in George Bush's home state.
 With the conventions-that-almost-were behind them, the city that
alternately describes itself as ``America's Finest City'' and the
``City of the 21st Century'' hopes to prove to the country  -- and
itself  -- that it has more going for it than the weather.
 ``We believe in a lot of outside feedback,'' said Francine
Phillips, author of America's Finest City  -- If We Say It Enough
We'll Believe It. ``We've long felt that if we do it here, it's not
really good enough.
 ``For years and years, we were second to Los Angeles in size and
second to San Francisco in sophistication. Now San Diego is coming
into its own. It's an opportunity, and a risk. We're going to get
exposure, and we feel vulnerable.''
 Jack Ford, son of former President Gerald Ford, is responsible for
setting the stage in the compact bayside convention center, built
in 1989. It was designed to hold 13,000, but it's been reconfigured
to hold 19,600. That still falls well short of 50,000 in Houston's
Astrodome and 40,000 in New Orleans' Superdome, site of the 1988
 Seating is so tight that it has helped the price for nondelegate
tickets soar through the convention center's tentlike roof. In
Houston, anyone who donated $1,000 to the party got two floor
passes. In San Diego, donors have to pony up $100,000 to qualify
for the same two tickets.
 The host committee's head of protocol, Bill Black, couldn't even
secure enough seats for the 92 foreign ambassadors and their
spouses he's entrusted with shepherding around the convention and
to social events. Since most are smokers, however, he figures he
can rotate them in and out of seats when they sneak to the terrace
for a smoke.  It will look more cramped than recent conventions.
A CBS executive complained the convention will come across on TV
screens like ``a postage stamp with a bunch of ants crawling around
on it.''  Ford, executive director of the host committee, put the
best face on the situation as he walked around the convention floor
 ``It's the Camden Yards of conventions centers,'' he said, as
stagehands hammered away on temporary skyboxes. ``It will be more
intimate, not big and sterile like Veterans Stadium.''
 As for all the carping about not having a dramatic balloon drop
from the 27-foot ceiling, Ford said jovially: ``There are lots of
other possibilities, not the least of which is having a balloon
 An array of protesters has lined up to get a rise out of
delegates. To control them, police drew up 55-minute slots spread
over five days, with 15-minute breaks to rotate protest groups.
 Groups stood in line for up to 72 hours to have first crack at the
65 spots. Thirteen protest groups identify themselves as Democrats.
At least eight spots were reserved by gay and lesbian groups. ``This is going to be the largest mobilization of lesbians and gays
ever in this country,'' said Brenda Schumacher, a spokesman for a
group called Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Voices '96.
``We've faced an extremely hostile political environment ever since
'92. We want to expose the lies and show an accurate picture of who
we are.''  The Republican National Committee tried to confine all
the protesters to a sit e three blocks from the convention center.
It said the parking lot across the street should be reserved for
handicapped parking.
 But the ACLU sued, and a federal judge agreed the Republican
proposal would violate the protesters' right to be seen and heard
by delegates. Police, who estimate 10,000 protesters at a time can
wedge onto the two-acre parking lot, had drawn up the time slots
for protest groups wherever they wound up.
 Parking will be at a premium. The Secret Service has banned
underground parking at the convention center. And the Republican
National Committee has reserved every spare parking space in town
for its people.
 The host committee raised about $12 million to put on this party,
more than double what any other city contributed before. In return,
it's counting on $160 million to be spread around town during
convention week and good publicity to pull in even more economic
 Knowing the Republican reputation for big spending, every business
in the vicinity, from Hooters restaurant to the Goodwill Industries
store, is decking itself out with GOP paraphernalia.
 The Cuban Cigar Factory laid on extra tobacco rollers in early
January. Limousine companies lined up cars from Arizona and Nevada.
One bar opened its doors just two months ago, unabashedly calling
itself the Grand Old Party, complete with a pink neon elephant in
the window. Even Carol the Painting Elephant at the San Diego Zoo
is getting into the act, readying an exhibit of the brush strokes
created by her swinging trunk.
 Still, a few San Diegans profess to be unfazed about all the

This is an astonishing mainstream media documentation of the role of the
U.S. state in the guns for drugs trade and its social devastation results in
the U.S. Although the piece focuses on U.S. involvement on the guns end in
Central America, this was a clear two-birds with one stone
counter-insurgency strategy at this end, too.  Given the continuing effect
of crack (and its hypocritical super-criminalization by the government),
genocide is probably too  mild a word for this.
'80s effort to assist guerrillas left legacy of drugs, gangs in black L.A.
By Gary Webb
Mercury News Staff Writer
For the better part of a decade, a Bay Area drug ring sold tons of cocaine to the Crips and Bloods street gangs of Los Angeles and funneled millions in drug profits to a Latin American guerrilla army run by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, a Mercury News investigation has found.
This drug network opened the first pipeline between Colombia's cocaine cartels and the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles, a city now known as the ``crack'' capital of the world. The cocaine that flooded in helped spark a crack explosion
 in urban America -- and provided the cash and connections needed for L.A.'s gangs to buy automatic weapons.
It is one of the most bizarre alliances in modern history: the union of a U.S.-backed army attempting to overthrow a revolutionary socialist government and the Uzi-toting ``gangstas'' of Compton and South-Central Los Angeles.
The army's financiers -- who met with CIA agents both before and during the time
 they were selling the drugs in L.A. -- delivered cut-rate cocaine to the gangs through a young South-Central crack dealer named Ricky Donnell Ross.

I agree with you whole-heartedly. I am stunned by the EFF's position on
this matter and they no longer have my support. Here are some more
of Dyson's statements on this subject.
   [...]
   The EFF began very much as a civil rights "don't tread on me" kind of
   organization, and in a sense one of our major jobs was helping to
   educate law enforcement and the government. I wouldn't say that job
   is done, but now we also need to educate a broader population. If our
   motto was civil rights in cyberspace, it's now civil rights and
   responsibilities, because as more people come on to the Internet,
   they have to understand their responsibilities as well as their
   rights. If people don't do that, someone is going to try to come and
   regulate them. We are trying to create a civil society rather than a
   legal society in cyberspace.
   [...]
   We are strongly in favor of privacy, although there's some kind of
   balance required because of the need for a free press. Anonymity is a
   tougher one, and we actually don't have a formal position on that.
   The need for anonymity I agree with, but there are issues with
   accountability that mean it shouldn't be absolute.
Examining in detail Dyson's interests it appears she maintains a
sizeable and long-standing interest in Eastern European technology
companies. She is also clearly very far to the right of the political
spectrum (rampant capitalist would be putting it mildly). She also speaks
Russian. I'm not saying she has been working for the CIA for the past
decade, but I would be very surprised if the CIA has not exerted quite
significant pressure (which they are easily able to do given the
location of many of Dyson's assets) in order to bring her into their
folds during that time period.

Certain members of the EFF board seem to be politically naive. The
rational, intelligent lobbyist will always see both sides of the
argument.  Presenting both sides of the argument to the world at large
is another matter altogether. You should only present both sides of the
argument to the inner policy tactics personnel only in order to formulate
policy and create defences for the weaknesses in your position. To the
outside world only ever sees a united front. This is basic politics.
The EFF is most certainly not the only speaker on the floor where this
issue is concerned. There are some very powerful government interests
who oppose anonymity in any form. For the EFF, who is viewed as normally
opposing government regulation, to have it's spokes-person start
shooting off her mouth and the EFF's previous position down publically
before they even go into battle is political suicide.
The claim of `I was just presenting my personal opinion on the matter'
doesn't hold water. Dyson represents a political lobby group and has no
"personal opinion" when talking publically about issues that concern the
organisation she has been elected to represent. In the interview
material I have seen Dyson talks about the EFF in the same context as
the anonymity issue, and the reader understandably gains the impression
that she is speaking on the behalf of the EFF, and I'm sure at the
time Dyson and the interviewer thought she was too.
Compromise is part of the legislative process, but it is something you
do behind closed doors when the battle is concluded and each faction
is counting the dead and starting to divide up territory. If you
start the battle in a compromised position, expect to loose everything.
Dyson, given her age and experience should be well aware of this, which
is why I find her remarks unusual.

I agree, however you are confusing large parties, so dominant as to form

goals are relatively narrow, its membership tiny.  Such a small group,
fighting under-resourced battle against powerful, conservative interests

I've reviewed many US computer crime / toll fraud cases, including

guidelines, which are extremely rigid and compartmentalised, leaving
a sentencing judge with almost no disgression or ability to impose
a sentence that fits the crime as a whole or the defendant as a whole.
Whether Nico or anyone else found the violence against Cummings
"shocking" or "to be expected" or not, is of no import. No one is
surprised to hear that a pretty girl walking alone through central park
in the middle of the night has been brutally raped. This makes the
crime, and its effects on the victim no less hideous. Those that abuse
their power and inflict grave violence on others must be held
accountable and their crimes deplored and punished in the strongest
manner. Failure to do so merely creates an environment where such
behavior becomes predominant. This is not acceptable.

All COCOM countries most likely. That said Australia does not seem to be

export provisions over cryptographic software in this country. The COCOM

            the member-countries of the Wassenaar Arrangement, also
            known as the New Forum, Foreign Ministry spokesman
            Mr.Pantelei Karasimeonov told a briefing yesterday. Of all
            the 28 participants in the session, it was only USA that
            opposed Bulgaria's participation in the arrangement, a
            control regime which is to succeed the Cold War's COCOM
            export controls of technology and equipment usable for
            military purposes, too, it was revealed at the briefing.
            Bulgaria has stated many times, and at different levels, its
            willingness to join the new control regime, the Foreign
            Ministry spokesman emphasised. In a statement, disseminated
            by BTA, Bulgarian News Agency, Foreign Ministry pointed out
            that obviously some of the participants in the Wassenaar
            Arrangement talks are still under the rather depressing
            impressions of the suitable conditions created in the
            country for wide-ranging scot-free ruin and lack of
            ownership, which apply also to the military-industrial
            complex and foreign trade in spesial-purpose production. Mr.
            Karasimeonov said that these impressions have sprung from
            the period of radical economic and political reforms in the
            country; he voiced his hopes that the founder-states of the
            Wassenaar Arrangement would soon change these views of
            theirs and would put their trust in Bulgaria's export
            control abilities.
            Trade Ministry officials said that bilateral talks are due
            to be held between Bulgaria and each of the New Forum
            member-countries, which are expected to result in Bulgaria's
            joining the arrangement. An expert group is to visit USA
            from April 29 till May 3 aiming to acquaint American high
            officials with the measures Bulgaria has taken to control
            trade in spesial-purpose production, Mr.Vladimir Velichkov,
            head of Internationally Controlled Trade Department at Trade
            Ministry, said in a recent interview for the PARI Daily. By
            June an expert group of the Wassenaar Arrangement is due to
            visit Bulgaria to lead discussions about our participation
            in the New Forum.

REVENGE OF HER MAJESTY'S SPOOKS
Eric Margolis  5 Dec 1996
Comrade-in-Chief Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev banged his fist onto
a solid oak table, knocking over bottles of Armenian mineral water and vodka, and bellowed at the ashen-faced
chiefs of the Soviet aircraft industry: `The Motherland's
honor is a stake. Beat the Concorde! Or you will all be
designing coal mines cars in Siberia!'
Such is the story I'm told by someone who was there. I'm
recalling these events now because a group of US aircraft
companies and NASA have partnered with Russia's Tupelov
aircraft firm to take the old TU-144 supersonic transports
out of mothballs and fly 32 test flights.  My advice to the
eager US aviation people is: watch the tests from the
ground. Here's why:
In the late 1950's and early 1960's, the Soviets were
boasting they would shortly overtake America's capitalist
technology.  Soviet propaganda dismissed France as a nation
of foppish boulevardiers, and Britain as a degenerate,
toothless old lion. The `degenerate' British and French stunned  and mortified
Moscow by announcing development of a supersonic jet
transport,  made with European technology. The outcome of
this project was the exquisite, technologically superb
Concorde, which continues today to fly passengers at twice
the speed of sound.
The Kremlin ordered a crash program to develop a Soviet
supersonic transport, or SST, no matter the cost. The famous
Tupelov design bureau was selected to develop the plane, by
`storming,' if necessary, 24-hours a day, until completion. Unfortunatly, Tupelov designers couldn't develop a workable
design in the short time given them by the Kremlin. So  KGB was ordered to steal the blueprints of the Concorde. A score of KGB agents were dispatched to England and France
in a highly complex and expensive mission designed to
infiltrate plants where the Concorde was being built.  Such
military-industrial spying is often used by  nations trying
to save time, money, or both.  Agents of Israel's Mossad,
for example, managed to steal the complete blueprints of the
French Mirage III fighter after Paris refused to supply them
to Israel.
Now comes the fun part- as told to me by the late,
distinguished RAF commander,  Air Marshall Menaul.  British
counter-intelligence, MI5, according to Menaul, learned of
the Soviet penetration and identified many of the agents
whose haste, and deviation from KGB standard operating
procedures, made them sloppy.
The wicked British got their top aviation engineers to
doctor a set of Concorde plans - so that the aircraft's center of gravity was too far aft, making it dangerously
unstable, particularly at low speeds. The bogus drawings
were left where they could be purloined by the KGB.  A few
days later, the tainted plans were in Moscow.
On Dec 31, 1968, the TU-144 - instantly dubbed `Conkordski'-
made its maiden flight - a few days before the Concorde's
inaugural flight.  Chairman Brezhnev was ecstatic. In 1973, the Soviets triumphantly sent their TU-144 to the
Paris Air Show.  There,. before the world's eyes, the
`Conkordski' went out of control and crashed. The horrified
Soviets became the butt of international ridicule.  Another
TU-144 crashed outside Moscow in 1978. From 'pride of Soviet
aviation,' the poor TU-144 soon was called, `the supersonic
A few were put into Moscow-Tashkent service, first flying
terrified passengers, then just mail.  The `Conkordski' were
taken out of service in 1978 after the second spectacular
accident.  I'm sure many toasts were drunken that night in
London at MI5 headquarters.
The new TU-144 flights are being conducted with the
Americans to develop a future, 300-passenger  SST. Tupelov
has refurbished some of the aircraft, but I'm uncertain if
the basic design flaw introduced by Her Majesty's spooks has
been corrected. Probably not, leaving the Conkordski
lethally wobbly. Such is the revenge of British intelligence, served up cold
and lethal - as the best revenge always is.

Just as there are differences in physical attributes between races,
so to are there are differences in the brain between races, and even
for genetic enclaves within races (and sexes which genetically,
contain greater differences than between races).  However, it has
been my experience that individual differences exceed racial
differences making the whole race vs. anything discussion a waste of time.
i.e people should be judged as individuals not as members of one
race or another, because that is where the most useful discrimination
The only time as-a-race attributes matter is when you are setting
public policy for an-entire-race, which in my opinion should never
be done. Set the rudder of your public policy by the correlation
between the statistical attributes that you are trying to address,
rather than what may or may not be a real correlation between those
attributes and race.

By core team fiat.  It is they who will be giving up power, it is they
who have the power to enforce initial disbursement.  After that, it
*should* be metastable.  If it isn't, it can be reigned in.
This one: yes.
+, if we are talking probabilities applied to strange attractors.
Constitutionally, there must be a method for doing this within the
system.  Mostly, the weight values are the time rate accumulation vs.
the spend rate on voting issues.  If you are actively positive, you
affect change; the stronger you feel about something, the more likely
you are to code it (which every direction the strength of your feeling
The catch is that positive votes are inherently more valuable than
negative votes, since to obstruct progress requires a number of votes
equal to the outstanding proposals, but to move forward a proposal only
requires a number of votes equal to the proposal.  Blind obstructionism
(and blind advocacy) are uneconomical.  That's the point of having
more than one vote to potentially spend on an issue, with potentially
more issues than you can vote on all of them.  You will have to pick
you battles carefully if you want to avoid being lost in the noise.
It won't, really, if there are places for deals to be made, and there
are accurate vote tallys published (promoting last minute bid frenzies,
auction-like behaviour).
There is a limit on the amount of weight you can throw around in a
given time because of the high water mark on the number of tokens it's
possible to build up on account.  Again, you have to pick your battles
or you will be lost in the noise.
In the abstract, if you are willing to do the work, you are more
likely to throw three votes than one for a given topic.  If you are
just being obstructioninst, you will likely throw only one vote so
that you can keep being obstructionist later.
For reciprocity, it's possible to charge off percentages in the
win/lose case to bias the power concentration: if your side wins, it
costs you one less token then you voted, etc..  Again, initial
bylaws are established through constitution provision: "we have the
power that is being shared, therefore, these are the weights".
Heh.  I was thinking more in terms of its value as a cascade trigger
to increasingly complex social organisms in the Internet implementation
space.  Representational democracies (republics, really) came about
because of rate limits on communication.  The US could not elect a
president by popular vote because there were no methods of verification,
and communication rates were limited by travel time.  Therefore, the
US has an Electoral College.  But a side effect of this structure is
a bias for bipartite seperation of interests, instead of seperation
into as many interest groups as it takes to do the job of mapping the
interest space.  This bias is not removed because the bipartite
interests have (and must continue to have) the power concentration.
This leads to continued "wasted vote syndrome", where people vote
for the lesser of two evils instead of voting their conscience... an
effect of mass psychology.  Similar pressures prevent the polling
times from being changed to opening at 8am EST and closing at 8am EST
to prevent early returns from earlier time zones influencing the
outcome of elections before people in later time zones have even voted.
For example, Ross Perot got almost 20% of the vote in the 1992
election, but 0% of the electors.  He would still have lost, given
the actual values.  There is actually a case in US history where the
winner of the electoral vote lost the popular vote... the president
was not chosen by the people, but by the electors.
It would be worth one or more articles in WIRED, actually, as well
as more scholarly sociology journals.  Maybe even "Wall Street Journal"
would run "Multinational Democratic State Declares Independence in
Cyberspace" or a similar silly headline.
Yep.  The reason I went weighted, by the way, was the volunteer
nature of the project.  In theory, number of vote tokens spent
should be proportional to willingness to actually volunteer.  As
you point out, there could be feedback here as well: for instance,
if a proposal passes, if it is completed, the tokens spent on
the vote could be refunded to those who voted for it.  If it dies
on the vine, the tokens could be refunded to those who voted
against it.  Being right would give you more license to participate,
and being wrong would not, etc..  Again, a matter for the initial

Actually, I think you'll find he was proposing a two stage process
where the above example only allows a further vote to be taken as to
whether or not it should become `policy'.  This second stage is where
you spend your vote tokens if you want to stop something passing.
You are really alluding to the possibility of things `passing' due to
apathy of the vast majority.  That could be easily fixed.  I imaging
that people with `vote tokens' have them because they are registered
as `adherents' to the FreeBSD religion.  The Votebot could send each
adherent a re-registration slip, say every three months.  No reply
means you are automatically removed from the adherents list and your
voting rights disappear.  You can easily re-instate yourself at any
time and your previous vote tokens (if any) are then restored.
In this way you trim out people who have lost the religion.
At the first stage of voting, a decision to have a real vote on a
policy change will *only* be made if (a) a significant fraction of
adherents take part in the vote AND (b) there is a majority of `yes'
over `no'.  That way, if there is general apathy, the thing dies.
At the second `real vote' stage, you must then decide whether to
spend your vote tokens.  Once again, things `pass' only if a quorum
is involved and there is a majority of `yes' over `no' votes.
The required quorum could be quite different for the first and
second stages of voting.  For example, the quorum to decide whether
or not to put things to a vote could be set at say 20% which would
not stifle the process but the quorum to actually change policy
could be say 40 - 50% to make sure that a vocal minority couldn't
`roll' the silent majority.
Terry did offer to implement the voting system.  Why not take
him up on his offer with the first question to be decided being:-
Q. Should changes in FreeBSD policy be made by an auto-voting system?
and if you get a `yes' on that then the second could be:-
Q. Does the Emperor have some clothes after all??  :-).
Seriously, it might be useful to have the user community vote on
important policy issues (like a.out versus ELF) knowing that there is
really no binding commitment on volunteers to do anything if it
doesn't suit the volunteers.  I'm sure everyone really does understand
and accept that.  It would also be useful to kill off discussion that
has exceeded its use-by date (like this thread) by putting it to a
vote and then getting on with more useful things.
All the above is, of course, IMHO.

@_subject: Cryptographic Mythology 
Here is something to amuse, delight and horrify - the tail of:
       _One Man's Search for a Cryptographic Mythology_.
I recently wrote a VNODE (4.4bsd) based encrypted file-system. Now
the day dawned when I decided it was high time to discard my rather
egocentric working name _Proffs_ (i.e Proff File System) and cast
about for a decent, respectable name. My first thought on this
matter was:
CERBERUS, n. The watch-dog of Hades, whose duty it was to guard
   the entrance -- against whom or what does not
   clearly appear; everybody, sooner or later, had to go there,
   and nobody wanted to carry off the entrance. Cerberus is known
   to have had three heads, and some of the poets have credited
   him with as many as a hundred.
Only, what was the relation between KERBEROS and CERBERUS? Pups
from the same litter, or was the relationship a little more
incestuous? I had to find out. There was no way - n o  w a y - I'd be
having my encrypted file system playing second fiddle to that evil
authentication beast.
KERBEROS; also spelled Cerberus.  n.  The watch dog of
   Hades, whose duty it was to guard the entrance--against
   whom or what does not clearly appear; . . . it is known
   to have had three heads. . .
Mythology couldn't get any more incestuous than that.
450,000 bytes of Greek polytheism later, and I'm wondering if the
Gods of Olympus really had any high-paid guards to speak of except
the multi-headed mongrel from Hades. I'm feeling down. I'm cursing
the Ancients. I'm disrespectfully humming tunes `All and All it's
Just Another Greek in the Wall', and `Athena be my Lover' when I
JANUS: in Roman mythology, custodian of the universe, god of
   beginnings. The guardian of gates and doors, he held
   sacred the first hour of the day, first day of the month, and
   first month of the year (which bears his name). He is represented
   with two bearded faces set back to back.
Custodian of the universe. Guardian of gates and doors. Cooool.
Janus.  January. I like it.  Only while I'm liking it, I'm thinking
that I've heard the word Janus a lot before. I'm thinking it isn't
just me who has looked up from the middle of a Greek mythology
text, whilst in the throes of a name hunt with the words "Cooool"
on their tongue.  No: the Gods just don't smile on me that way.
AltaVista confirms the truth of Heaven's bad attitude towards me.
17,423 references.  _The Janus Mutual Trade Fund_, _The Janus
Project_, _Janus ADA95_, a dozen ISPs from Canada (what is it WITH
these Canadians?), _Janus' cool word list_ (turns out to be not so
cool), _The Janus Ensemble_, _Hotel Janus_, _Janus Theatre_,
_janus.com_, _janusfunds.com_, _Janus_ an Australian Police drama
series and of course, the sixth moon of Saturn - _Janus_. Janus is
out-of-the-picture. I'm not sure whether to feel smug or grim about
the rest of the world's lack of originality.
Guards. Guardians. The Greeks didn't have many with bite and I'm
loosing patience with the whole culture. Euphrosyne, Aglaia, and
Thalia do not grace me.  What I need is something that evokes
passion within my cryptographic domain. And when you come down to
it, that means something which produces copious amounts of gore
and blood, at will, from those who would dare to pass its demesne
of protection.
     The Erinyes, or Furies, were three goddesses who punished by
     their secret stings the crimes of those who escaped or defied
     public justice. The heads of the Furies were wreathed with
     serpents, and their whole appearance was terrific and appalling.
     Their names were Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera.  They were
     also called Eumenides.
Aye. Plenty of gore there. But somewhat lacking in cryptographic
analogy.  Fantastic material for the group that doesn't meet at
number 41 every Saturday night though. They will appreciate what
the Erinyes were trying to achieve.
Somewhat heartened, my mind turns to the Erinyes' dress sense. "..heads
of the Furies were wreathed with serpents, and their whole appearance
was terrific and appalling". Terrific. Serpents.
Terrific \Ter*rif"ic\, a. [L. terrificus; fr. terrere: to frighten
   + facere: to make. See Terror, and Fact.] Causing
   terror; adapted to excite great fear or dread; terrible; as, a
   terrific form; a terrific sight.
Is it a symptom of society in decay that this word has come to mean:
Excellent \Ex"cel*lent\, a. [F. excellent, L. excellens, -entis,
   p. pr. of excellere. See Excel.] 1. Excelling;
   surpassing others in some good quality or the sum of qualities;
   of great worth; eminent, in a good sense; superior, as an
   excellent man, artist, citizen, husband, discourse, book, song,
   etc.; excellent breeding, principles, aims, action.
Or as Milton would say:
   To love . . . What I see excellent in good or fair.
On the other hand, David Hume (1711-1776):
   The more exquisite any good is, of which a small specimen is
   afforded us, the sharper is the evil, allied to it; and few
   exceptions are found to this uniform law of nature. The most
   sprightly wit borders on madness; the highest effusions of joy
   produce the deepest melancholy; the most ravishing pleasures
   are attended with the most cruel lassitude and disgust; the most
   flattering hopes make way for the severest disappointments. And,
   in general, no course of life has such safety (for happiness is
   not to be dreamed of) as the temperate and moderate, which
   maintains, as far as possible, a mediocrity, and a kind of
   insensibility, in every thing.
Perhaps it is the sign of a brain in decay, rather than a society
that I dwell on it so, because Terrific hair serpents of course
lead unfailing into the arms of the Medusa. A guardian of fearsome
looks, but dubious motivations according to authorities like Clash
of the Titans (1981). A moot point, perhaps as Princeton's
history department no longer wants to talk to me. I'm cast adrift,
to rely on my Plasticine childhood memories and the mythological
swamp of the web.

Jesus. I've been sucked into comic book hell. Princeton, take me
back.  I won't curse at the ancient Greek's sexual proclivities
anymore. I'm sure chaste marriages were very daunting to those yet
to have them. I was only joking. Lighten up will you?
But, alas, the history faculty however was still nursing its
wounds, and was not ready to forgive me. I'd have to find an
authoritative source somewhere else. Perhaps I could filter out the
comic book hell contaminants and come up with respected history Ivy,
even if it wasn't Princeton Ivy.
   To decapitate - to castrate. The terror of the Medusa is thus
   a terror of castration that is linked to the sight of something.
   The hair upon the Medusa's head is frequently represented in
   works of art in the form of snakes, and these once again are
   derived from the castration complex. It is a remarkable fact
   that however frightening they may be in themselves, they
   nevertheless serve as a mitigation of the horror, for they
   replace the penis, the absence of which is the cause of the
   horror. This is a confirmation of the technical rule according
   to which a multiplication of penis symbols signifies castration.
   Sigmund Freud
   The Medusa's Head
You had to hand it to Sigmund. He was nothing if not authoritative,
and after reading his inspiring words on the terrific serpent haired
woman, it became clear to me that _Proffs_ and the Gorgon had somewhat
unresolved metaphorical incompatibilities. I didn't want my software
giving anyone a castration complex.
I decided to put aside the denizens of Olympus from contest verbatim.
I'd read Fraud on Perversions a few years before and knew Medusa
was just a portent of what was to come.  What I needed was another
polytheist culture entirely.  Latin didn't help me. Nearly all the
Roman Gods had been vilely plagiarised from the Greeks, Latin names
or not.  Freud knew this as well as I did.  The Norse gods were of
little assistance to me.  The only one worth paying school to was
Loki, the Norse god of mischief. Loki was a very cool fellow, which
was why his name has been appropriated as a moniker by virtually
every Bjorn, Sven, and Bob hacker to come out of Scandinavia in
the last 10 years. No, Loki was not for me.
The problem craved for a polytheist mythology outside the realm of
my, and more importantly Sigmund Freud's, Western European upbringing.
The answer to my question was by definition locked within a body of
history I didn't know an onion skin about. In order for the pilgrim
to reach the master he must first place his foot on the path, no
matter how gradual the slope up the mountain of enlightenment. Zen
Buddhism is good like that. Fabricating parables up as you go along
that is.
   Zen master Gutei raised his finger whenever he was asked a
   question about Zen. A young novice began to imitate
   him in this way. When Gutei was told about the novice's imitation,
   he sent for him and asked him if it were true. The novice admitted
   it was so. Gutei asked him if he understood. In reply the novice
   held up his index finger. Gutei promptly cut it off.  The novice
   ran from the room, howling in pain. As he reached the threshold,
   Gutei called, "Boy!". When the novice returned, Gutei raised
   his index finger. At that instant the novice was enlightened.
But wait. This Koan isn't fabricated. At least, not by me. And
unlike most Zen Koan's I think you will agree that it pleasantly
satisfies Schopenhauer's "life, without pain, has no meaning".
However, semantically I'm seeing a very unhealthy correlation to
forgetting one's encryption key and losing one's finger.
My mind is drawn to the memory of the real-life nightmare of laying
in the easy-chair of a Swanston St. hypnotherapist suite, gazing
intently into a bright, but distant red light, while chanting the
mantra "I am not cynical about hypnotherapy. I am not cynical about
hypnotherapy.  I am not cynical about an Indian doctor with a 5th
floor office decorated coup'd'Edelstien. I'm not cynical about a
man who claims that his foremost clientele are rich middle aged women
who have put their jewellery somewhere "safe" and consequently
are unable to recall the location.  I'm not cynical about a
hypnotist who extols the virtues of having a M.D. so his patients
can claim 2/3rds of the cost of these jewellery retrieval sessions
under Medicare. I'm not cynical that these middle aged women are
infact suffering from some form of Mesmer complex.  And by all the
powers in Heaven, I have no pessimism about recalling my god-damned
I never did remember the pass-phrase and you will notice Gutei
keeps very quiet about what he does with the novice's finger. In
this particular case, given the value of the data, I would have
traded placed with Gutei's novice, before you can say "Boy! Was I
I put my chin on my knee, and stare at the grain of my beige
plastic monitor case. Unless I could jump into another reality
it was the end of the line for _Proffs_ and _One Man's Search
for a Cryptographic Mythology_. Boy! Was I bummed. One of the great sins of us programmers is procedural thinking.
And it was exactly this sort of folly I was engaging in. There were
around 6 billion other realities going about their business. I
grant you that 2 billion of these were no doubt indulging in the
confusion and diffusion of an avalanche of pseudo-random mental
images and sequences we associate with dreams, and probably another
2 billion busy expanding their minds with the powerful products of
hash or decaying into a compressive state of increasing entropy
and beer rounds. This still left a select 2 billion souls with
which to weave my work.  If I approached them directly rather than
by analysing the information trails they left behind, I'd stand a
good chance of getting my feet onto the path of cryptographic
mythological enlightenment.
I have a Swedish friend who calls himself Elk on odd days and
Godflesh on even days. Don't ask why. As far as I know he's not
bisexual. Elk listened to my quest for cryptographic myth. He
had pondered, and uncovered a diamond in the rough. MARUTUKKU.
  The third name is MARUTUKKU, Master of the arts of protection,
  chained the Mad God at the Battle. Sealed the Ancient Ones in
  their Caves, behind the Gates.
F a r  o u t. Master of the arts of protection. Chained the Mad
God.  Sealed the Ancient Ones in their Caves, behind the Gates.
Even the very word MARUTUKKU looks like it has been run through a
product cipher.
But I wasn't about to trust the work of a self-admitted Swedish
Sumeria freak who was obviously suffering from a bi-polar moniker
disorder. Was it mere coincidence that MARUTUKKU was an anagram
for KUKU MART and KUKU TRAM? I didn't want MARUTUKKU to end up as
another cog in the annals of Freudian analogy. What I
needed was the sort of Authoritative History that only Princeton's
history faculty could provide. The tablets of the Enuma Elish:
  The Akkadian Creation Epic
   Based on the translation of E. A. Speiser, with the additions
   by A. K. Grayson, Ancient Near-Eastern Texts Relating to the
   Old Testament, third edition, edited by James Pritchard (Princeton,
   1969), pp. 60-72; 501-503, with minor modifications.
   This work, the ancient Mesopotamian creation epic consisting of
   seven tablets, tells of the struggle between cosmic order and
   chaos. It is named after its opening words. It was recited on
   the fourth day of the ancient Babylonian New Year's festival.
   The text probably dates from the Old Babylonian period, i.e.,
   the early part of the second millennium B.C.E.
   The third name is MARUTUKKU  Master of the arts of protection,
   chained the Mad God at the Battle. Sealed the Ancient Ones in
   their Caves, behind the Gates.
   MARUTUKKU truly is the refuge of his land, city, and people.
   Unto him shall the people give praise forever.
All praise the MARUTUKKU! My search had born a ripe and tasty
fruit indeed. The quest for a cryptographic mythology was
complete. Or was it? The words of Hume kept coming back to me
and I had a nagging feeling that there was some substance in
If MARUTUKKU was my exquisite cryptographic good, of wit, effusive
joy, ravishing pleasure and flattering hope; then where was the
counter point? The figure to its ground - the sharper evil, the
madness, the melancholy, the most cruel lassitudes and disgusts
and the severest disappointments. Was Hume right? Because if he
was, there was only one organisation this string of hellish adjectives
could represent. The cryptographic devil with its 500,000 sq feet
of office space in Maryland. But surely there could be no reference
to such an organisation in the 4,000 year old Babylonian tablets.
The idea was preposterous. Wasn't it?
TABLET VII OF THE ENUMA ELISH:
ESIZKUR shall sit aloft in the house of prayer;
   May the gods bring their presents before him, that from
   him they may receive their assignments; none can without
   him create artful works.  Four black-headed ones are
   among his creatures; aside from him no god knows the
   answer as to their days.
It's a cold and wintry night, here in Melbourne. Despite this, the
gusts of wind and rain seem to be unusually chilling. What had I,
in my search for a cryptographic mythology, stumbled onto?
I look hard at the seven letters E-S-I-Z-K-U-R. A frown turns to
a smile and then a dead pan stare. I write down:
Prof. Julian Assange  |If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people
together to collect wood and don't assign them tasks
proff          |and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless
proff  |immensity of the sea. -- Antoine de Saint Exupery

IS YOUR FAVORITE COMPUTER PROGRAM RACIST?
Texas programmer sues former employer over offensive code.
When Willa Jackson started working the night shift at Integrated
Systech in Austin, Texas, she felt she was entering a world filled with
opportunity. Jackson had just completed three years of intensive course
work in computer programming at a local community college and, at the
age of 47, had recently been hired by the successful software
developer. Her night-shift position at IS was to be Jackson's first
non-minimum wage job.
But that optimism soon turned to shame and then anger as Jackson
discovered that many of her colleagues at IS were accustomed to making
racist jokes in the office. In fact, the epithets were never actually
uttered in Jackson's presence, they were encoded within the dozens of
software applications being developed at IS.
Her painful discovery occurred less than one month after she began
working as an entry-level programming assistant. It was Jackson's
responsibility to find bugs in sections of code that other,
higher-level IS programmers produced during the day. But when Jackson
