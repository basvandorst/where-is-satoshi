@_subject: Speaking of TEMPEST.... 
I was able to procure a tempest specced HP Laserjet + (model 2686 TA),
used around a year ago and recently did a motherboard swap to upgrade
the unit to 2mb of RAM...wasn't all that much to rip apart and put back
together...even with all the damn machined-screws and shielding, the thing
still emits a fair amount of noise, but no farther than the room it's in...
I checked all my cables and system box and switched to shielded cables and
cleaned up the the noise as best I could...interesting design and at least
I would see the damn snoops...they'd have to be in my front yard to pick it
up...anyone else hack any used TEMPEST stuff?

@_subject: Speaking of get togethers.... 
While we're on the subject, is there anyone on the list in the NE Ohio
area (Cleveland) interested in getting together?  I'd love to go to Boston
or the West Coast, but just can't swing it with my work schedule ;-)

would anyone happen to have the numeric ip address for eff.org or
ftp.eff.org handy?  I'd sure appreciate it....
