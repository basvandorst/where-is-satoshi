Regarding the Electronic Democracy idea, I vote with Tim May.  Look at the
way public opinion is molded today through CNN, Tom Brokaw, Connie Chung, Oprah Winfrey, etc.  One could even say that Clinton is the "Phil Donahue
president" (he 'cares') - just look at the second candidate debate last fall.
A talk show if ever there was one.  No, erasing procedural safeguards in the name of access by the masses is an *EXTREMELY* bad idea, because a lot of these archaic procedures still have use and serve a filtering function,
albeit one that may not be recognized fully until they are removed and drastic, undesirable, unwanted,and unintended consequences follow.
What we should be doing instead is focusing our analytic powers on the present bottlenecks and distortions in the system and resolving those
rather than opening ENTIRELY NEW "runoff channels".  For at the end of the
day, the only beneficiaries of innovation are the ones poised to exploit it.
And that certainly is not the "enlightened citizen" today.
What am I saying?  If we allow direct legislating power to go to everyone,
we will eliminate the concern with PLURALITY that the Constitution
protects.  If not sooner, then later.

Sorry, but today's currency system is anything but a democracy.  Thank God.
It works because it is entrusted to a COMPETENT elite.  The "global approval"
of bills that you suggest seems to be to inevitably lead to the worst sort
of populist rhetoric and pandering becoming law.
You don't seem to recognize that in an age of irrationalism, opening the doors to mass participation any further will simply de-legitimize the system
even more.  (I suppose if you liked Motor Voter, you dont understand why
I am saying this.)  But look at the Constitution.  Its paradigm is for a
federal government of limited powers to function as the "glue" to hold
together otherwise disparate political entities.  The point is that majority rule is only *half* the story in American democracy;
the other half is checks and balances to ensure that those who do not
fit into the mainstream can pursue life, liberty,and happiness.
Since you think I am blathering on in vague generalities, let me put it another way:

instead of promoting another "magic bullet" (ie electronic democracy),
why dont we just take a stand against the tide of ignorance and violence
that has engulfed us?
new technology handed down from on high will serve only to amplify the underlying instabilities unless these are addressed first.  or at least
of course there are short term profit opportunities in innovation, fortunes
to be made.

@_subject: Violent overthrow? 
This may be a semantic point, but it should be made....
David Koontz sez: "Avoiding the appearance of endorsing the violent overthrow of government is prudent policy..."
Um...I think I know what you mean, but isn't it better to just say outright
that violence really is not the way to reform government at all, save in
truly historical, exceptional cases (American Revolution, French Revolution...)
I am no code cruncher but it seems to me that the relevant "precedents"
for a "Cypherpunk Revolution" would be the Russian democracy movement, where
the power of ideas toppled the oppressive regime with a minimum of bloodshed,
while the world watched....
The way Mr Koontz puts it is awfully ambiguous and open to be read as a *very* cynical and disingenuous kind of "waffle".
Point:  Violence is abhorrent to civilized conduct, undermines social cohesion,
and is generally justifiable only as a defensive measure.  Arent we concerned
with the state of affairs today precisely because individuals no longer
have a sense of these kind of boundaries?  So it is important to emphasis
that violence is part of the problem, and not to be sloppy and suggest
(inferentially) that it could be part of the solution.

@_subject: Re: Digicash 
I dont see that a "reverse" ATM card (ie, one that was "charged" with
money to spend) poses any greater risk to the bearer, IF some kind of
authorization code/check is built into the card.  What I am hazy on is how such an authorization could exist while avoiding
the problem of creating a dossier.  If the individual user could encode
his own PIN on the card without telling the bank, that would do it.
Or, the bank could know the PIN but if the Retailer's transaction software
never *records* the PIN, then there will be no privacy problem...since
there will be nothing to cross check against the bank's records.
The retailer is happy cos he has HIS data (item sold, amount, date, etc);
the consumer is protected, and the bank is not involved at all.

Maybe someone has said this, but another key way to foster privacy is to START A BANK that values this.  I recal some references to Swiss banking, anonymous accounts,
etc, before.  So wouldnt it be a good idea to find some bankers out there who wanted
to create a niche market for themselves, and sell them on the crypto-protocols?
First suggestion:  try Miami....

@_subject: Re:  Digital Coin Claim 
The idea of Digital Gold, here, now seems to include a Chain of Title dimension.
The idea that successive owners need to "record" the transfer from the previous
owner just completely *baffles* me.  A bearer instrument is payable to WHOEVER IS
HOLDING IT.  There are no title searches done on coins used in everyday commerce.
What "hnash" proposes is probably do-able, but currency does not operate this way.
On the other  hand, this is exactly what you do with Real Property.  I think that creating a chain of title for digicoins would defeat the whole purpose
of the exercise.  Creating a history of ownership is done in order to increase
accountability, not privacy.  And such a history is necessary only to clarify disputes over ownership, liens, defects....things which are simply not problems with currency and bearer instruments.
The question is, what is the end to which this chain of title is being put?  To verify that the holder is a "valid" holder?  THIS IS IRRELEVANT.  He who holds,
owns.  A safeguard MAY be introduced (such as a PIN) for public policy and convenience (ie people will not be scared of armed robbery), but it is a secondary
measure.  The digicoin is by definition (and purpose) SELF-AUTHENTICATING.  Any computer magic
here will only be the electronic equivalent of the red and blue fibers in the dollar
bill paper, the seals, the complex designs and colors of other currencies, etc.
Otherwise you don't have money.

Clarification 1) unix munched out on some text.  Para 2:  "such a history is necessary
only to clarify with currency and bearer instruments disputes over
ownership....arg try again now
"to clarify disputes over ownership, liens, and defects - things which are
simply not problems with bearer instruments"
Clarification 2)  Digicoins may differ from ordinary currency in being revocable,
but this is not necessary.  That is, X loses his digicoin.  Y finds it and uses it.
Just like money.  OR:  X loses his digicoin.  Y finds it but cannot use it b/c Y
does not know the PIN.  OR:  X loses his digicoin.  Y could use the digicoin, but
X calls the issuing bank and they cancel the digicoin number.  or verification-type approach, there is clearly a major privacy problem.
At least this is the way I see it...
