Oh really?  A year ago you didn't want anyone looking at RC4 at all!
But since you now seem to be for open review, we'd be happy to
cryptanalyze RC2 for ya also.  :)

"Encyphering minds want to know."
The Podunk, Idaho Cypherpunks chapter held its annual meeting this past
weekend at Buffalo Jim's Bar and Grill, where the sole attending member,
Frank Semalo, was promptly arrested by local authorities for wearing a
"munitions" T-shirt.  He was released the next morning when the NSA confirmed
that the T-shirt was probably legal to wear in Podunk as long as Mr. Semalo
did not enter the local Mexican or Chinese restaurants.
By a 17-13 vote today, the Remailer Operators Association decided to start
sending out ALL anonymous remailer e-mail with a header entry of:
Surgeons at Netscape Communications successfully removed Jim Clark's foot
from his mouth today.  The foot was reported to be doing fine, but a little
wrinkled and in need of a good pedicure.  Company spokespersons reported
that the reason the foot was in there so long was that Mr. Clark was in
Washington, D.C. discussing the future of government regulation of the Internet with 'top government officials', and could not return to Mountain
View for surgery until recently.  In related medical news, proctologists at Bethesda Naval Hospital reported that Louis Freeh's head was still
firmly stuck.
Spam of the month:  Friend
The International Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals announced
today that it was investigating the Blue Wave Corporation to determine if
any of the snakes were harmed or killed in the production of its signature
product, SimplySafe.
Just a coincidence?  Immediately after Tim May announces that he will not
be discussing Netscape anymore because he's making some financial plays on
the stock (hinting that he's probably shorting it), it drops 30 points?

     Uri Geller offers $1 million to spoon benders on World Wide Web
     Starting February 29, professed psychic Uri Geller will be offering $1
million to anyone who can bend a spoon on the World Wide Web.  The spoon will
be sealed in a transparent safe and shown by live video feed on his Web page
at   He says he's tired of skeptics constantly asking
him to proove his mental abilities, which he can't do on command, so he's
looking for someone who -can- perform on command.  You won't be able to just
hit the page and stare at the spoon for free, though...  This golden
opportunity will cost $4.50 a glare.

Security can't control their own site. It only seems like yesterday
(actually about 2 years ago) that another one of their "RC" algorithms
was published to the Usenet thru anonymous remailers. Can't they
secure their own site against break-ins? If they want to be the
prima-donna site for encryption with all of the "copy-written" crypto,
you would think that they could protect their own resources better.

English translation:
We didn't want to release our algorithm because we were afraid
somebody might find a weakness.  Sure enough, somebody did.
So I guess we're going to keep it a secret after all.
Hey, kids, security through obscurity just doesn't work.
