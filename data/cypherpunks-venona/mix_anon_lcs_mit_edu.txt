I hope this is not true.  Some of us simply believe it is important to
help people with unpopular opinions speak without fear of harassment.
I for one will continue to operate a free remailer even if the
technology becomes available to charge for the service.  I hope others
will, too.
Some people do care about things other than money.  I hope the reason
there aren't more remailers out there is simply that it is sort of a
pain to set one up, rather than simply because nobody cares.
Well, wanting there to be remailers is a good incentive to run one.
Another good incentive is if you ever want to send a truly sensitive
anonymous message.  If you chain through your own remailer, then you
can be absolutely sure that at least one remailer in your chain is not
run by "bad guys."
Usage statistics are publicly available from mixmaster remailers by
sending mail with subject "remailer-stats".  Whenever I've checked,
the number of messages through the lcs mixmaster remailer has been
around 300/day.  This is neither a longtime remailer nor a
particularly accurate statistic, but it should give you some idea.

@_subject: Re: How can you protect a remailer's keys? 
A far better solution would be to have a long-running daemon hold the
secret key.  The mixmaster client could talk to the key daemon through
a unix-domain socket with the permission bits set such that only the
mixmaster user can connect.  Each time the machine is rebooted, the
operator must start the daemon and give it a passphrase.
This has two advantages.  First, it's a lot harder to back up the key
by accident.  If the key ever starts making it only your daily
backups, you are completely hosed because erasing a bunch of mag tapes
would take a lot of time--and maybe you also want to keep your
Second, if your machine is seized or someone gains unauthorized
physical access to it, the easiest way to get a root shell is by
rebooting single-user.  However, if the only cleartext copy of a key
is in memory rather than in the filesystem, once the machine is
rebooted the secret key is lost.

The answer is no.  Plenty of sites gate mailing lists to local
newsgroups, and allow open or relatively open NNTP access.  It's also
silly to assume every other person in the universe is trustworthy.
If Mr. Y sends lots of obnoxious mail to a mailing list or news group,
the proper thing to do is to put Mr. Y in your killfile and encourage
others to do so.  That way you don't get bothered by his annoying
messages, and if enough people follow suit, people stop responding to
Mr. Y's messages.  This can be even be extended to cover anonymous
posts using NoCeM-like systems.
If you try to boot Mr. Y off the mailing list using technical means,
several bad things will happen:  First of all you will fail, which
will give Mr. Y a great deal of satisfaction.  Second of all, you will
drive Mr. Y to start posting under different names, making him
considerably harder to killfile.  Third of all, you will double the
traffic on the mailing list by starting flamewars about whether this
failed booting attempt was ethical, legal, intelligent, homosexual,
scatological, or just plain useless.  Since at this point tons of
people will be replying to threads, a killfile becomes even harder to
So don't look for convoluted technical solutions to Mr. Y's
personality problems.  Just use a little basic common sense.  If you
don't like the way someone behaves on a mailing list, just ignore the
damn person.  Anything else is just going to make matters worse, as
recent history clearly demonstrates.

searches for censorship (initially ignoring sex),

sex, but again such a search is not very likely to be useful.
This isn't any kind of censorship attempt on the part of DEC, just a

@_subject: PGP 5.0: What were they thinking? (revisited) 
I went and took a look at this. They've broken the PGP functionality into
several different psuedo-binaries which are just symlinks which point to the
same binary. Invoking just 'pgp' gives this:
Now this, of course, breaks all matter of things. Some of this may be wrong, so feel free to correct it:
Phil releases PGP. It rapidly becomes a standard for personal privacy and is
used all over the world. Various versions come about including several
international versions. Finally PGP 5.0 is released. It uses a completely new scheme, including DH
keys. The Windows version purposefully excludes RSA key generation, in
effect forcing people to generate DH keys. There is no UNIX version released.
Weeks or months later, after incompatabilities were introduced into the
system, UNIX versions begin to filter out. Instead of keeping command line
compatability so scripts and programs which call PGP still work, they decide
to break the functions up into several different invocations, all of which
point to the same binary anyway. The README-BIN file for the "beta 11" Linux
distribution says:
They also take the liberty of coding in a timebomb:
$ ./pgp
This beta evaluation version of PGP has expired.
$ pwd
"lnx-b11" is the version currently handed out by  by the
way. The "PGP 5.0 beta for Linux Intel (US version)" selection on their
download page leads to a link to:
The current source distribution from that site is b8a. One of the README files from that reads:
However when one goes to  they're confronted with a legal
agreement. Of course the link to it from the front page won't work in Lynx 2.7.1 because it uses something called an "https" link, so the user has to type in the URL manually as " After reading this license and agreeing to it, the user is allowed to reach
the "BetaWeb" page. However the "public bug reports" link yields this:
So maybe you can at least get whatever the current beta is and hope it
works, right? Wrong. "PGP Personal v5.5.1 BetaHome"'s "Beta Software &
ReadMe Download Button" wants a user name and password, but it's doubtful
they have a UNIX distribution in there anyway considering the rest of this
mess. Well, at least maybe the user can suggest a new "feature" for PGP 6
and that feature be "Release a source distribution which when installed
doesn't break anything which calls PGP," right? Wrong. You have to have a
username and password for that too.
Well, obviously they want you to register as a "Registered PGP Beta Tester"
to get this clearance. However "Beta Registration" yields:
And of course my 2.6.3i breaks on this "Hash: SHA1" stuff.
So correct me if I'm wrong but the way I see it is like this: A new version
of PGP was released. It was incompatable with previous versions. They
release a Windows version but don't release a version which works under
UNIX. Of course Windows users now start using the "latest and greatest,"
sending messages and keys all over the place which are completely
incompatable with the version of PGP everybody else is using. They claim to
be working on a UNIX version, granted, but that should have been released
at the same time as the Windows version and *AFTER* there was an
international version of PGP 5.0 available. Their UNIX version of PGP 5.0
also seems to be completely incompatable with anything which calls PGP from
a script or program. In addition their UNIX versions are purposefully
crippled so that they don't work after a certain time period, don't provide
an override for this that I can see, and they insist on releasing
binary-only distributions for Linux which prevents people from commenting
that out. They have no method to get new up to date versions, nor do they
have a method to report bugs like they say they do. Further the
"PGP50-lnx-b11-6126098-1.src.rpm" contains the *BINARY* distribution, *not*
the source. I've also been informed that PGP 5.0 encrypts to the CMR key
without even bothering to ask and there's no way to override that short of
hacking the key record.
What the hell are these people thinking? Did they get into bed with
Microsoft to try to get people to say "screw this" and go use Windows?

If you use PGP 5.0 many people will refuse to read your messages and send them to you. They won't be able to decrypt your messages, verify
your signatures, or use your keys. In general, using 5.0 just pisses people
off. 5.0 is purposefully incompatable with all previous versions of PGP,
they purposefully haven't released usable versions except for Windows and
possibly Mac, they've purposefully broke any scripts and programs which
invoke PGP, they purposefully made command-line versions of PGP many times
more annoying to use, and PGP 5.x encrypts to a "CMR key" without having the decency to ask. Generally the PGP 5.x folks are being complete and total assholes about this entire thing and haven't done anything to improve the state of cryptography
today and a whole lot to worsen it. Somebody recently posted a large rant about this titled "PGP 5.0: What were

Nothing like this, coupled with repeated false claims of "forgery", to give your posts a little "plausible deniability", is there?

Well, if posting public information is OK, then why the hate campaign against Ron Guilmette and his business for (allegedly) doing like you and Gary did?
Actually, either you're lying now about the reason that Gary posted the info
back in February, or Gary was lying back then when he said: "What say each time you slam DataBasix for no reason, we post some publicly available information about monkeys.com.  HEre's the first try" and "More where this came from. Yu wanna keep slamming DataBasix for no good reason?". [1]  That sounds like an attempt at censorship through intimidation to me.  After you pull stunts like that is it any wonder that people post their opinions anonymously?  The more you attack anonymous remailers and their users, the
more people will see the benefit of utilizing them.
           ^^^^^
No, LIFE isn't, but, OTOH ...
Now I'm beginning to see why you weren't able to convince Jeff Burchell that
you were a "lawyer" for DataBasix when you tried the Scientology-esque stunt
of demanding that he turn all of his (non-existent) user logs over to
DataBasix to use in their witch hunt against the users of his remailer. [2] Going on a tantrum like that in a courtroom would get you jailed for contempt of court.
I see you haven't changed your typical DataBasix tactics of demanding proof
from others, but never bothering to offer any for your own accusations.  Like
the accusations that Ron Guilmette "spam baited" addresses at databasix.com.
(The only thing you've posted that even looked like evidence was some idle
talk about netcom.com addresses.)  Or how about that claim that Mr. Guilmette
supposedly "abused" an unnamed "teenage girl" at DataBasix?
As far as giving anonymous posters a bad name, since when have you EVER
had anything decent or civil to say about those who don't believe that setting one's self up for abuse should be the price of free speech?  Calling
anonymous posters "anon assholes" only betrays your pernicious bigotry and
hatred of those who dare to speak their minds without subjecting themselves
to the revenge that seems to (coincidentally?) befall those who dare to
criticize the almighty Sadaam Burnore.
As far as "delta sub-morons" engaging in "forgery" (assuming they aren't your
fellow "delta sub-morons" on the DataBasix gang) what about all the crude
attempts at forgery involving the e-mail addresses of those who've dared to
publicly disagree with Gary Burnore and his DataBasix wrecking crew?  What
about the letters in various MMF and MLM NGs saying "I have a lot of money
to invest, please send me information on how I can get rich quick" and
purportedly signed by these folks?  I must have missed your vehement
protests about that.
Did anyone force you to post THIS tantrum?  Don't let the door strike your posterior on the way out.
Once again, you post accusations without proof.  (Maybe I ought to do my
DataBasix impression of you and Sadaam Burnore stomping your feet and chanting in unison, "Not a shred of evidence! Not a shred of evidence!")
You can only say "I didn't do it, nobody saw me doing it, and you can't
prove a thing" so often.
Your post no evidence that such alleged abuse even occurred, nor that, *IF* it
did occur, it was perpetrated by someone other than you or one of your fellow abusers at DataBasix, perhaps as a pretext to get a remailer shut down.  If by your "former e-mail address" you're referring to an account at DataBasix.com,
could the real reason be that Gary is so technically inept that he has been
unable to get the databasix.com domain up and running after his hasty exodus
from California to North Carolina?  that's been his alibi -- "I
couldn't have posted any spam bait - databasix.com is still down".
Your whining is so hypocritical, anyway.  Where were those protests when your
fellow staffer at DataBasix, William J. McClatchie (aka "Wotan"), was busy
making THOUSANDS of e-mail addresses useless when he went on his successful
campaign to get the Mailmasher server shut down?  (Remember the bogus "forgery" charges and the pitiful "evidence" that was posted?)

This year, Jeff Burchell's "Huge Cajones Remailer" came under attack.
Alleging "abuse" involving that remailer, Gary Burnore and Belinda Bryan of DataBasix demanded that Jeff turn over ALL his logs to them.  Fortunately, Jeff wisely kept no such logs.  Even though the remailer was eventually harassed out of existence, the privacy of its users was preserved because the information the attackers demanded simply wasn't there to demand.  That's a wise idea for the same reason that retail merchants remove the cash from their cash registers when they're closed, leaving the cash drawers unlocked.  There's less temptation to stage an attack if you know in advance that you won't get what you're seeking (the identity of someone you'd like to silence, for example) by staging such an attack.  Any operator that keeps identifying information is inviting litigation, or worse.  If you're an ISP and are making money, then perhaps that risk is justified.  But you can't expect a volunteer operator of a free remailer to take such a risk for You're right.  For those who only need a superficial level of "anonymity"
and don't really care if their identity is eventually revealed publicly,
some of the alternatives such as Hotmail would perhaps suffice.  But that's
a decision best left to the user, and not to be mandated by others with a
lesser stake in the consequences.

I don't agree with you on this one, Bob.
The fact is that the 16th was never properly ratified.  It slid through the cracks, contrary to the procedure for ratifying amendments as outlined in the Constitution.  The reason there was no public outcry was because the initial tax was 1% on anyone earning more than $4,000 a year (roughly $80,000 in today's money).  Besides, I seriously doubt many people rushed
down to the Treasury to cough up their 1% either.
This deceptive non-ratification is clearly documented by Bill Benson in his book "The Law That Never Was" .  Although his book has been in print for several years, I have yet to hear of anyone who has refuted his claims.
The "pseudoconstitutionalist claptrap" that should be pointed out is your claim that "the constitution's what the Supreme Court says it is."  Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution gives the Supreme Court judicial power "...to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this The words "under this Constitution" imply that the Supreme Court must work by the letter of the law as outlined in the Constitution.  How can the Supreme Court pass a decision involving the 16th when the amendment was never ratified as outlined in Section V?  These are the kind of shenanigans
one would expect from a banana republic tribunal, not the Supreme Court.
Why bother to repeal what never existed?  When enough people learn what really happened, and when they couple it with the fact that most of their tax money is wasted and could be better "redistributed" according to their
own individual judgement, the house of cards will collapse.
I hope so, too.  But I don't advocate waiting until that day to fight back.

It seems so pointless to correct Choate.  The guy is almost totally
impervious to enlightenment.  But a couple of whoppers have to be
pointed out...
Electrons don't "carry" photons.  An atom can absorb a photon, raising
an electron to a higher energy level, but the photon is then gone.  And
a single moving electron certainly doesn't carry a photon.  Photons move
at the speed of light, always.
Quarks are constituents only of baryons.  There are no quarks in electrons
or photons.
Choate's bizarre description of a "spark gap" inside a conductive
globe culminates with this:
The net charge within the sphere will not change.  If the box in the
middle with the "spark gap" is spraying out electrons, this can only mean
that the box is itself becoming positively charged.  The sphere sees a
constant charge within itself; at best, the charge can be redistributed.
There are no net changes of charge within the sphere and so there will
be no changes in any charge appearing on the outside of the sphere.
Choate's whole model of how a spark gap transmitter works, and why it
emits electromagnetic radiation, is so bizarre that it is hard to believe.
Someone else can bang their head against the brick wall of his ignorance
on that topic.
Choate is, by far, the worst poster on the cypherpunks list today.  He

@_subject: Re: Grounding (fwd) 
Listen to this.  Jim Dolt thinks that a spark gap inside a conductive sphere
will cause charge to build up on the surface of the sphere!  The dunderhead
has forgotten about conservation of charge!
Gauss' law says that the charge on the outer surface of a closed
conductive sphere will be equal to the net charge inside the sphere.
The spark gap can't change the net charge inside the sphere, it can just
move charge around.  Jim Dolt has conveniently forgotten about the net
positive charge which will build up on the spark gap as it (supposedly)
emits electrons.
His Doltish notion that electrons will hit the inside of the sphere
and "tunnel through" to the outside is totally confused.  Suppose this
happened.  We've removed negative charges from the interior of the sphere
and put them on the outside, where they would give the sphere a negative
charge.  Now, what is the net charge on the interior of the sphere?
We started neutral and removed negatives, hence it's positive!  Gauss'
law would imply that the sphere must have a positive charge.  But Jim
Dolt tried to give it a negative charge from all those electrons that
"tunneled through."
The whole idea is ludicrous.  No charge can spontaneously appear on
the outside of an ideal closed conductive sphere.  This would be a
violation of the law of conservation of charge.  By Gauss' law, the
charge on the outside is equal to the net charge on the inside.  If a
sphere, just sitting there in empty space, suddenly develops a charge,
then that means that the interior has manufactured charge out of nothing.
It is impossible.
The fundamental misconception that started this whole sad comedy of
Doltish errors was Jim Dolt's belief that a Faraday cage has to be
grounded in order to suppress electromagnetic radiation.  This has led us
to his revelation of his further misunderstandings of how charge behaves
inside a conductive surface, not to mention his numerous errors about
the mechanism by which a spark gap transmitter generates EM radiation.
(Hint: it has nothing to do with a cloud of electrons spreading out from
the spark gap!)
The fact is, Jim Choate knows nothing about this topic, and the same is
true for most subjects that he writes about.  He loves the attention
he gets, but if more people told him they knew how worthless his
contributions are, he just might go bother someone else.

There used to be a rule of thumb that you'd want roughly a megabyte
per megahertz.  Today, with our 200+ MHz processors, we tend to have
considerably less memory than this.  My Gateway PC from a couple of
years ago came with a 200 MHz Pentium Pro but only 32 MB of memory.
Most PCs today are not well balanced architecturally.  They should
really have a couple hundred megabytes of memory.  Memory is cheap
enough today that this can be added, but the motherboard configuration
may limit the amount.  If you had this much memory, swapping to disk
would be a smaller problem.
As for the idea of running without a disk drive, see the handheld PDAs
like the PalmPilot and the Microsoft WinCE machines.  The problem with
these from the security standpoint is that the memory is non-volatile.
With a PC, we don't worry too much about junk in memory because we turn
it off occasionally.  We are concerned about the disk because that is
where the persistent storage is.
But with a memory-only machine, you end up using your memory as a de-facto
disk drive, so that the contents of memory become just as sensitive as
the contents of disk would be on a PC.  Someone who gets hold of your
PDA can dump out memory and find sensitive data which is stored there.
Theoretically you can use a password to protect data, but then there are
tradeoffs between security and ease of use, and you may end up leaving
data exposed for extended periods.
But speaking of using passwords to protect data, how about an encrypted
swapfile for a PC?  There are fast enough ciphers today that the virtual
memory system could encrypt data as it swaps to the disk, and decrypt
as it loads back into memory.  You'd type in the passphrase at boot time.
This would solve the problem of sensitive data leaking onto the disk via
the swapfile.  There could still be traces in memory, but at least this
most obvious leak would be plugged.  You don't have to wait for apps to
be rewritten to use secure memory allocation drivers, you get the benefit
Can existing encrypting-filesystem drivers be used for swapfiles?

How to Spot a Government Infiltrator                               by Mike Johnson
Those who have been studying the stories released to the media these days about the arrests of
various different people within the militia movement will doubtlessly have noted that government
infiltrators are usually involved. This should make people nervous. And rightly so. Our normal view of government is that the only people who should have to worry
about what the government is up to are people who are breaking the law. As the vast majority of
constitutional militia units are composed of people who are of good character and don't go around
breaking the law to begin with, they might feel that they should have little to worry about from the
government. Unfortunately that does not seem to be the case. The government appears to be going all out to
discredit the constitutional militia movement in this country. This effort on the part of the government
does include the use of government agents to infiltrate militia units and cause as many problems, hate
and discontent as they possibly can. In many instances, these government agents may not be readily
apparent as to who and what they are. Some of these people may have had extensive experience in
working undercover operations and may not make some of the more stupid mistakes. There are a variety of different roles that such government operatives may play. The first is that they
may simply act as a mole. They will do everything anybody else in the unit does, and do nothing at all
to call undue attention to themselves. However, they will relay everything that goes on within the unit
to their handlers. About the only indication a unit may have that they have been infiltrated by a mole
may be that they can't seem to be able to keep anything a secret. This type of role is the most difficult
for a unit to detect and deal with. Which is also possibly why most of the spy novels that get written
deal with various different ways to smoke out moles. While I wouldn't suggest that anybody try a
technique for which the only source of documentation is a work of fiction, it is an indication of just
how obnoxious this type of agent could be to deal with. Another role that a government agent might play may be that of a dissipator. A dissipator is one who
tries to redirect the course and energy of a unit in ways which will cause it to accomplish nothing of
any importance. They may also act so as to break a unit up by emphasizing differences,
disagreements and personality clashes between unit members. Given that the people who are
attracted to the constitutionalist militia movement usually tend to be strong willed and opinionated
people to begin with, such an agent may find that his task is somewhat easier than it might be if he
were working with other groups. Unit members should simply be encouraged not to take things
personally, be aware that there will be honest differences of opinion between the members of the unit,
and to be wary of somebody who does try to take everything personally, or set up cliques within the
unit. The final role which will be discussed is that of the agent provocateur. Such an agent infiltrates a unit
and tries to get the members of the unit to actually commit crimes, or make it look like they are
actually planning to commit crimes. One should also bear in mind that a government agent is not going
to be confined to operating within any one of the roles that have been discussed, and may likely mix
and match as they feel best. However, the role that has received the highest profile in government
operations these days is that of the agent provocateur. That is largely because the results of an
operation conducted by an agent provocateur or two make for good propaganda when the media
gets hold of it. The resultant publicity given to the arrests and the charges gets used to brand
everybody in the entire movement as a criminal. The fact that the entire thing was set up by someone
in the employ of the government isn't going to be mentioned at all by the mainstream media. For those who haven't caught on by now, your antenna should start to quiver in the presence of any
one, or especially a combination of the following behaviors/patterns demonstrated by a unit member:      (1) Wants to make bombs.
     (2) Wants to get everybody else to make bombs.
     (3) Wants people to buy/store large quantities of substances which could be used for
     explosives manufacture.
     (4) Fanatic about obtaining fully automatic weapons, without benefit of Class III
     license.
     (5) No obvious means of support, especially if they have lots of money to throw
     around.
     (6) Auto license tag changed on an irregular basis.
     (7) Encourages people to plan/do stupid things (raid armories, blow up office buildings,
     etc.)
     (8) Some groups can get auto tags run. They should be especially suspicious of
     anybody whose auto tag turns up a complete blank when run. (9) In our case, the guy
     was absolutely paranoid about his car being out of either his sight or his "wife's" sight for
     even a trivial amount of time.
     (10) Person claims to have a military background that they do not have. One individual
     claimed to be former Special Forces, but was found to be ignorant of some of the things
     that he should have known when quizzed by people who were former Special Forces.
     Depending on the level of trust that the members of your group have with each other, it
     might be a good idea to request to see the DD-214s of anybody claiming to have a
     military background.
     (11) One of your members has taken effective action to expose or block activities of
     the police or government preventing the expansion of or preservation of government
     power to control people and/or invade the privacy of the people.
     (12) One of your members (a) has an FFL; or (b) is involved in selling at gun shows; or
     (c) Is involved in promoting gun shows. Arguably the best way to deal with people who meet criteria 1-10 is simply to invite them to leave
the unit. As Starr and McCranie found out, trying to turn them in will do no good at all, so the next
best bet is to try to get them to leave. Failing that, disband unit, start again from scratch with people
you can trust after sufficient elapsed time. Given the way things are going right now, those who have
not joined up with public units may want to consider forming small closed units with just a small group
of people that they have known for a long time and that they trust. For persons in 11, and 12: Do your best to be sure the goons cannot find a pretext as that is what
they often work from. (*) Bill Albert of the Michigan Militia contributed to the list of items to look for and the discussion
which follows it.

The Military's Growing Involvement In Domestic Law
                              Enforcement
For more than a century the U.S. military has been banned from involvement in routine domestic law
enforcement. This tradition of separating the role of national defense from domestic law enforcement
has it's origins in the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. This law prohibits the army from being involved
in domestic arrests, or in searches and seizures. This ban was later extended to the other services. It
was passed in response to abuses committed by occupation troops in the South after the Civil War.
This long tradition, which has helped to insure liberty and democracy for Americans, was quietly
abandoned in 1989 when Congress and the Bush administration ordered the military into the "war on
drugs". Since then the Pentagon has spent more than $7 billion on counter-drug activities, using tens
of thousands of active duty and reserve personnel.
Active duty units are primarily used to monitor and patrol for drug smuggling activity using
sophisticated surveillance and communication systems. These units are assisted by thousands of
National Guard troops whose activities are not normally restrained by the Posse Comitatus
legislation. This allows them to perform routine police activities such as inspecting cargo, analyzing
intelligence, and translating wiretapped conversations.
The military's involvement in domestic policing activities has now been institutionalized and is being
coordinated in the Defense Department by the Joint Task Force Six (JTF-6).
Supporter of using the military in drug enforcement activities argue that drug use threatens the country
economically and socially. Some military commanders see counter-drug operations as providing
troops with useful training. While law enforcement officials see it as an opportunity to benefit from
sophisticated surveillance and communication systems that they wouldn't normally have access to.
Opponents of giving the military domestic law enforcement responsibilities and powers remind
supporter of the abuses by troops that originally lead to passage of the Posse Comitatus legislation.
They also point out that the military's involvement in drug enforcement efforts haven't had any
discernible impact on the availability of drugs in the United States; so why take the risk of losing our
liberties when we gain nothing in return.
People need to ask themselves where the movement to involve the military in domestic policing
activities is going to stop. Are Somalia, Hati, and Bosnia simply peacekeeping activities, or are they
being used to train U.S. troops for the near future when they will be patrolling the streets of the
United States as they now patrol Bosnia.  -0777-- -export-a-crypto-system-sig -RC4-3-lines-PERL
