UNIX?  user hostile?  where have you been lately?  ever hear of X windows?  Indigo Magic Desktop?  these and zillions of other innovations have made UNIX more user-friendly than any other operating system I have used (which includes DOS, Windows, OS/2, and NeXTstep, among others).  The only real barrier left to UNIX becoming the OS of choice is commercial app support (things like word processors and etc. becoming readily available and inexpensive).

XFree86 was a snap to set up on my system, and I'm no guru.  In addition, Linux does not occupy the entirety of the UNIX spectrum - SGI systems, for example, give you graphics "out of the box", and so do many other workstation systems.  Granted, such machines are more expensive, but then we're talking about ease-of-use and power here, not cost.
I'm not a UNIX guru, as I said, although I do have some basic UNIX knowledge.  Slackware was, for me, one of the easiest installations I have ever done on any computer.  It was a breeze.
in fact, there are version of Wordperfect (and perhaps MS Word as well) for UNIX systems... they're just more expensive and less immediately available in the marketplace.

so your point, basically, is that the public will settle for whatever it can get, and get easiest and cheapest, when it comes to software and operating systems in particular.  This may be the case, but there is certainly a growing market for internet-capable systems, and the most internet-friendly OS around is, of course, UNIX.  In that fact, and in the growing importance of having an OS that utilizes the full capabilities of increasing powerful personal computers, lies the future of UNIX.

find works just fine for me...  there's also "whereis", in case you didn't know...
so it give it "expected" input...  since when does DOS like "unexpected" input, anyhow?
could we see an example of this?  I have yet to find one.
again, provide an example.  again, I have yet to see one.
different operating systems have differences...  the differences between IBM PC-DOS and MS-DOS are a good example.
again, different OSes are different...  you don't expect every company to make the same UNIX, do you?  what point would there be in cloning each I've never encountered this...  perhaps because I uuencode things and THEN send them rather than trying to pipe a uuencode into mail.
again, does DOS *not* do this?  at least UNIX gives you the option of killing a process in the first place...  I can remember having to reboot DOS and fiddling with multiple configuration hassles just to clear a device driver out in order to solve an incompability problem with another program.
I've done it.  Several times.  Within minutes, each time.  And I'm not a guru, either.  And, as you've pointed out, I wouldn't have had to do even that if I was working with an already-setup system.

I don't think supporting the free market has anything to do with supporting bad products.  I separate my ideological views from my technical opinions, quite frankly.  In addition, when did I single out Microsoft?  IBM and Apple make plenty of crappy products, which is ironic since they also make UNIX products that are technically superior and should probably be the de facto operating systems for their high-end machines (in fact, in IBM's case, they are - AIX is the default OS on rs6000 that depends on what applications you're talking about...  if you mean Word Processors, Spreadsheets, and (perhaps) games, then I'd have to agree.  If you're talking about programming environments/tools, graphical interfaces, networking software, graphic design software, or file server applications, not to mention at least a few other categories, I'd have to disagree strongly.
so UNIX users aren't "normal" now, eh?  by what standard do you define normal?  we're talking about both client AND server applications here, as well as the robustness of the multitasking/threading capabilities of the OS they run on.  when surfing the net, it's best not to have your news reader choke because your web browser needs more resources.
simple - they never will run the same, and they definitely won't run better, unless of course they are morphed into UNIX...  and I wouldn't be surprised if they do.  I see a day sometime not too far into the future when Windows, OS/2, and their kin either vanish completely or at least as non-UNIX operating systems, and are replaced with look-alike UNIX flavours with commercial app support.  if Microsoft, IBM, and/or Apple have the guts, that is.

that depends on what you think of as "internet-ready", IMHO.  OS/2 is ready to fail in an endeavour to be what UNIX has been for over 25 years:  a _truly_ internet-friendly, multitasking, multithreading OS.
really?  I would think over a decade of Japanese technical superiority in automaking (better gas mileage, better safety features, etc.) and the resultant move by the "Big 3" to be even more technically superior would tend to contradict that notion.  Consumers are not totally stupid - they may drool over and rave about the latest flashy, technically inferior car, but when it comes down to it they'll most often buy the one with the best gas mileage, the best safety features, and so forth.
