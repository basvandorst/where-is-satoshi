@_subject: Remailer delays 
I tried out a whole batch of cypherpunk remailers.  I sent ping messages to:
    remailer nowhere
    hh hh
    hh 00x
    hal cs60a-qu
    ebrandt catalyst
    remailer elee7h5
    hfinney sameer
    remail remail
    remailer remailer
    elee9sf
The ping messages were sent out at 20:27:44 EST.  Here's the ones I got
back, and the respective times:
nobody      20:30:46 (+0:03:02)
catalyst-remailer 20:30:55 (+0:03:11)
nobody     20:31:05 (+0:03:21)
nowhere       20:31:16 (+0:03:32)
remailer-admin 20:31:27 (+0:03:43)
nobody   20:31:50 (+0:04:06)
nobody      20:32:33 (+0:04:49)
nobody     20:34:01 (+0:06:17)
nobody  20:34:14 (+0:06:30)
nobody          20:37:08 (+0:09:24)
nobody     20:37:26 (+0:09:42)
remailer             20:45:48 (+0:18:04)
nobody         01:00:19 (+4:32:35)
I got mail bounces ("Unknown User") from:
After 24 hours, I have gotten no response from:
I think sameer just forwards to hh I got two messages back from hh elee9sf batches out messages at midnight (which is 1:00
My apologies to the remail operators who received the corrupted messages
from my failed first two attempts in their mailboxes.
