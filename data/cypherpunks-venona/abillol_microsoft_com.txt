What's worse, is that if you just want to call and get information about
a particular product, they can log you for their marketing database.

Reverse engineering is process of 'mimicking' the specifications of
another product by copying the 'abstract interface' of it. Example: I write a desktop application that greatly increases employee
productivity, and it sells like hotcakes. Another company decides that I
am gaining too much market share with my product and decides to reverse
engineer the product so that they can create a competing product. They
hire an engineer who takes the program and analyzes the input and output
with a detailed script of test patterns (heaven forbid he might even
decompile the program and snoop). By doing so, he now has a complete
product specification minus the implementation (i.e. how it works). He
then takes the product specification and gives it to another engineer
(actually it's done through 'clean' liaisons) who then creates a product
that does the exact same thing as mine--but with a different
implementation process. Because the product copies the specification and
not the implementation, it does not infringe on copyrights or patents.

I find nothing wrong with plinking. Hell, I'm from Montana--we used to
go shooting all the time. But when the shooting was done, the guns were
put away. What I find disturbing is that a child is taking it to school,
or just carrying it around. I say that any parent who thinks their child
is mature enough to carry a gun for non-recreational reasons is less
mature than the child. In fact, I'd go so far as to say they are a
danger to their own children.
I guess I don't really have to worry too much, though. It is illegal for
children to possess such items publicly, and any parent who condones it
is simply breaking the law. I don't blame the child, I blame the moronic
parent who let's it happen.

Yes, I work for satan. But I am wealthy because of it. Nice guys finish

Personally, I think the guys an asshole, but I commend him for his
capitolist efforts.
BTW - I'm an idiot. Never said I wasn't.
