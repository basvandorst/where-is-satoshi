LEAD STORY
* A 62-year-old woman pleaded guilty in Roanoke, Va., in November to
stealing about 500 pieces of mail from her neighbors' mailboxes--her third
such offense in five years. She had been found sane and competent for trial
but nonetheless diagnosed as having an "irresistible impulse" to steal
other people's mail. The judge had kept her confined to her home since her
arrest, allowing her full freedom only on Sundays, when there is no mail
delivery. [Roanoke Times, 11-21-95]
