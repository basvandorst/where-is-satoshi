@_subject: Employer Probing Precedents? 
To Whom It May Concern:
I was curious as to where I might find some electronic freedom legal precedents.  If, for example, an employer was planning to probe file systems on PCs in the off-hours and employees began encrypting their hard drives, what legal precedents would support the employees or would support the employer in blocking the encryption?
Thanks for any info you can give me!!
