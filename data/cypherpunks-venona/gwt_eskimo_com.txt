@_subject: Proposed policy: look like sig 
Eric said,
Wouldn't it "look like a signature" if I just copied at the end
of an article the actual signature of some other, signed, article?
That would be a true signature, just not mine and not for this
article.  It sounds as though it would meet the suggested requirement,
but I don't see how it would accomplish the goals.  I could do it
with a macro, or maybe use a special .sig for posts to this list.
It wouldn't add anything to my software.
What am I missing?

@_subject: Schneier book 20% off 
Tower Books is offering Schneier's _Applied Cryptography_
at 20% off list.  I saw it in the Bellevue, WA, store, and the
saleperson said the sale was national.  Everyone on this list probably has the book, but I thought
the info might be useful if you refer anyone to the book.
I don't know how long the deal will last.
