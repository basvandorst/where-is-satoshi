Crapola. They fear the unknown, and read their own personal prejudices and beliefs into something they don't understand. Maybe I'll start going to church  and explain to the believers about the benefits of crypto *against* such Revalationary measures. I'm sure they would be interested in the work Chaum has done regarding truly anonymous Hell, maybe we could set up a Dining Christians net.

I'm afraid I don't follow. Are you saying that the NSA is assuming a more public role because (apparently) stong crypto is now widely available to the public? I don't see the connection between A and B if this is what you are claiming.
Unless they're gearing up for a PR campaign... I wonder how the NSA has been portrayed in Hollywood in the past. I've just seen them mentioned in one movie I can think about ("Crimson Tide"). Anyone else know of references?

Has anyone checked to see if this is just an older but obscure published algorithm? If it uses an 80-bit key, that tells me it's not too old, but I'm new to this stuff.
If it is a new algorithm, is it just a variant, or something completely new? [Sorry in advance if this is noise...]

@_subject: Cypherpunks' ideal escrow agent 
I've seen the idea of voluntary key escrow discussed before on this list. (And no, not the government's idea of "voluntary", either.) A question I would raise is this: What would be the ideal setup for an escrow agency? If I were to open up an agency for business, what would be some characteristics you would look for?

@_subject: Newbie Crypto question: MOD? 
Ok folks, I recently received "Applied Cryptography" as a gift, and just have one question: How does the MOD function work in crypto functions? It seems to work differently than what I've seen before, i.e.: C/C++ MOD. I also didn't see anything in TCM's FAQ...
If this is considered noise, I apologize in advance.

@_subject: Re: MD4-derived hash functions 
Ah yes, but the vagarities of crypto don't lend themselves to real-world analogies so easily. With crypto schemes, if you use double-encryption, you effectively halve the amount of time needed to crack them. This is because of the "man in the middle attack." Schneier talks about it in Applied Crypto, and I am sure others on this list know the technical details better than I.
What Schneier says has been proven to be secure is, instead, a triple encryption scheme. Using two different keys, it goes something like this (if memory serves):
Where P1 is the plaintext, EK1 is encrypt key 1, and DK1 is decrypt key 1.
That doesn't look right the longer I consider it, but the basic idea is there. Encrypt, decrypt, then encrypt again.
