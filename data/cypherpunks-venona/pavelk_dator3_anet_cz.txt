@_subject: Sound card as a random number source ?? 
when I read about hardware random number generators in this mailing list, I got
one idea. Maybe it sounds crazy, but is it possible to use soundcard
(SoundBlaster for example) as a source for really random numbers ?
What if I connect the input line of the soundcard with some external source of
noise, like FM receiver or Dolby Surround decoder (with built-in white noise
generator) or tape recorder with blank (erased) tape. It is possible to sample
the sound (noise) and use the sampled values as a random numbers ? And how much
random is this source ? I tried to find some mentions about this method with altavista, but I didn't
found anything.

But there always can be some kind of test, like presampling and testing if the
input is not dead. And of course some kind of hash algorithm must be applied to the sampled stream
(MD5 ?).

And what if I will use FM receiver, tuned on some channel where is the noise.
If the potentional attacker don't know the what channel was tuned, he is not
able to reproduce this IMHO. Of course, maybe it is possible to record the whole
spectrum to tapes, but I think that the noise will change when recorded and
played back from tape.

@_subject: Protect against physical theft of the harddisk ?? 
I have one problem which I would like to consult with you.
I need to protect the data on the computer harddisk against physical theft.
Current situation:
Computer with several harddisks - approx. 9 GB. On this computer, the following
OS are used: Linux, DOS, Windows NT. The data on this computer must be
accessible from all operating systems. Encryption of files must be transparent
to user and encryption algorithm must be "strong".
Because I am not able to find any disk encryption software which is able to run
on all these platforms, I decided to use the following temporary solution:
Add one more computer with Linux OS. On this computer, there will be only a
small root partition with necessary Linux components. All other disk space will
be encrypted with IDEA, using the /dev/loop. This machine will be some kind of
secure file server.
On the second machine, where the user works, there will be partitions with
operating systems, necessary utilities and the TCP/IP stack for DOS/Windows, NT
and Linux. The data and application disks will be mounted via NFS and user will
work with files from file server.
The computers will be interconnected with Fast Ethernet. This mini-network is
NOT connected to the Internet, so the NFS (in)security should not be a problem. Also, both computers will be placed in the same room (distance approx. 3 m), so
there should be no problem with tapping/data capturing on the Fast Ethernet
I have the following questions.
Can anybody see some major security hole in this system ?
How fast will be this system ?
Anybody has any idea if there is some more sophisticated solution for this
problem ? Anybody heard about some strong disk encryption which is able to rund under
Windows NT, Linux and DOS ? It seems that the Win NT are the major problem. I am
not able to find any disk encryption for NT.
Anybody is able to port Secure File System to Windows NT ? I am trying to port
this program under Linux, but I am not the NT system programmer.
Thanx for any comments, help, ideas etc.
Best regards

@_subject: IDEA ecryption algorithm in 8 bits ? 
I hope that this mail will find his way to the mailling list.
I have one question. For one small embedded application, I need some encryption
algorithm which can be easily implemented in 8 bit microcontroller with 38 bytes
of RAM and 1KB of ROM. I tried to modify the IDEA algorithm to 8 bit operations - all multiplications
modulo 257, subkey length 52 bytes, block size 4 bytes. Simply, all operations
are converted from 16/32 bits to 8/16 bits.
Because I am no professional cryptographer, I would like to ask you, if there is
some major problem with this modified algorithm. Something what makes the 8 bit
variant completely useless ?
Is it possible to use this encryption algorithm ? I know that this variant will
be far less secure than IDEA itself, but I don't need so strong encryption. The
amount of data for encryption will be small, approx. 16 - 32 bytes.
Thank you for every information.
Best regards and PF 1997

Nice, but I can see one problem here.
If I (as a censor) will want to block your communication to prohibited sites, I
can block the access to the proxy computers. You will just move the blocking
strategy one level up with your plug-in. The censor will block the web servers
AND proxy servers. Because the list of proxy servers must be available somehow
to users, it is very simple to write some kind of script running on the gateway
which is blocking the acccess. The script will download the list of proxy
servers, update the gateway tables and the gateway will be blocking acccess to
all sites on the proxy list. Bye PavelK
