@_subject: Secure IRC 
How about the idea of a secure Internet Relay Chat?
A central server might maintain the list of everybody's Public Keys.
If you wanted to broadcast a 'public' yet secure msg in a particular
room making sure only participants in that room (and not eavesdroppers
somewhere else on the wire) could read the msg you could encrypt
your broadcast with the server's own Public Key.  Send it.
The Server receives it, decrypts it, then for each of the participants
currently in this particular room, the server encrypts the msg
with that person's Public Key and sends it.  Private IRC msgs
would be treated similarly, except that they'd be re-encrypted
only once, for the intended private recipient.
Anyone interested on working on this?  0r 1z 1t 2 layme?
