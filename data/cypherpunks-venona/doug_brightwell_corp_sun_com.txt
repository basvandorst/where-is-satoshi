Am I correct in understanding that what's actually detected and
reconstructed by TEMPEST surveillance is the EMR having to do with
screen drawing, and not the CPU and other internal components involved
in processing data?
If that's the case, would computers without CRT-type displays still be
succeptible to TEMPEST surveillance? Such as headless servers that
might be running a BBS without a video card inside or a monitor. Or
laptops, such as a Mac PowerBook with an active-matrix screen?

Synching up to monitor signals, I can understand.
But as a non-technical person, what I'm struggling to understand is how
a surveillance team could monitor the emmisions from such cables and
have any clue as to what they are. Let's say they zeroed in on my
poorly shielded modem cable and were able to tune into a stream of 0's
and 1's. How could they then resolve that digital data into anything
meaningful? It could be one of any number of documents created by one
of any number of programs on one of any number of platforms. How do the
spies know they're dealing with a Frame page layout document created on
a Sun workstation versus a spreadsheet created on a Mac?
Even if it's just a plain text file how could the surveillance team
read it? Does each member of the ASCII character set have specific and
identifiable radiation signatures? For example, does the letter "k" as
it passes through my modem cable have a characteristic EMR that is the
same for all machines?
Sorry if this query is too basic, but I would appreciate any enlightenment...

FYI, I tried src.doc.ic.ac.uk:tmp/pgp and the directory was empty.

Anyone know of any ftp sites where I could find the new 2.2 version?

Several weeks following a car accident that I was involved in, I
received a notice from the California DMV notifying me that someone had
filed a request for the information on my vehicle registration. From
the name and address on the notice, I figured out that it was the other
driver's attorney, probably wanting to know where to send a subpoena.
Apparently, anyone can walk into a DMV office, fill out a form, pay
$1.00 (or whatever) and get the info because it's public record.
However, at least the DMV also alerts the "investigatee" to the fact
that someone now has their home address, and provides the name and
address of the requestor.
