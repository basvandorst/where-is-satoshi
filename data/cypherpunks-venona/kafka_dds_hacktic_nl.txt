Remail 1.9 for Waffle UUCP BBS 1.65 - Cyph3rpunx wr1t3 k0d3!
Version 1.9
- Fixed lot's of stuff.
- Added help support. If you send as subject HELP or help,
  it sends you a operator configurable helpfile. ('remailerhelp:')
  in the Waffle static file.
        remailhelp: c:/waffle/system/remail.hlp
- Encryption works now
- Replying to anon addres works
- If a problem is encountered, the message is sent back to
  the sender, with a short helptext.
[ 1.7 - 1.8 are internal versions ]
Version 1.6
- Fixed problem that caused Penet mode to be on when
  you specified -v
- Fixed problem with blank lines in header
- Changed "Remailed by:" field to "Remailed-By:" (this
  apparently caused the empty header lines)
Version 1.5:
- "Encrypted: PGP" works now when pasted :)
  Remail now also works from inside Waffle, if you
  send the recipient encrypted.
- -v now gives even more jolly interesting messages
Version 1.4
- Cleaned up code (a bit)
- Added anonymous id database ('penet') functions
- Newsgroups that are not in the usenet file are added to it
- Wiping of plaintext PGP output files works now
  (file was open for reading only)
- Do not write EOF (FF) anymore when appending files
- Added "Organization:" field
- Added "Reply-To:" field
- Added "X-Remailer-Software:" field
- Added "Remailed by: "  header field
- Added -v (verbose) argument
- Added some error handling :)
- Added -penet argument. If given, remail allocates anymous ID's.
  If not, remail works as a standard cypherpunx remailer.
In the next versions I will add acknowledgement of allocation of
anon ID, ping, help, passwd.
Please let me know if you have any suggestions.
Please test the remailers:
    Penet style                     Cypherpunx style
