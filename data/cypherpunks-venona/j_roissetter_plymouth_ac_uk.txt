I am currently writting a report into the controverys invovled with data encyption and have desided to target the current DES system, I have found pages on the internet explaining the new triple DES system thought i need more information on the current controversys involved with the current DES system i'm aware that the key is no longer long enough for data to be protected for any amount of time, thought i really need more information to draw conclutions, if there is anyone with information could they please forward it to me.
