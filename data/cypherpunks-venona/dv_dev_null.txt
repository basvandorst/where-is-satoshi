ten months ago: on or about 961218:1123     "Timothy C. May"  purported
to expostulate:
+_Direct action_ is what it's all about. Undermining the state
+the spread of espionage networks, through undermining faith in
the tax
+system, through even more direct applications of the right tools
at the
+right times.
+When Cypherpunks are called "terrorists," we will have
done our jobs.
    [Tim] said this before Christmas last year as an erudite and
    addendum to my lengthy tome: "Cypherpunks as Philosophy
Kings"     that pretty well summed our generally mutually agreed "philosophy".
    both were and still are worth reading; anybody who does not
    copies, ask.
    but cypherpunk terrorists are not violent; this is all about
    information free and protecting privacy with technology.
    despite the fact the Commerce Committee effectively killed
    (or we think they did until Oxley tries to tack his amendment
    structure on an appropriations bill in a house-senate conference
    "manager's mark" procedure (whatever that is)),
we can not drop the     due diligence, and the public must be aroused, called to battle.
    even if there is no action, prepare for the next fire drill.
sow the
    seeds of dissension.
    seems to me we were sure the CDA was dead --except it slipped
in with     a manager's mark after the house voted almost unanimously
the other
    way (402-12 or something like that). the capitol hill sleaze
    took a grand slam NO and reported an even worse yes, making
it part
    of a major bill that absolutely was going to pass --and they
    have the gall to call that travesty democracy?  Teddy Roosevelt:
        "It is difficult to make our material condition better
by the         best law, but it is easy enough to ruin it by bad laws."
    Tim's message for Christmas last was the prophetic call for
    action; legal action; empowerment action: Robert H. Jackson
    (1892-1954), U.S. Judge:
        "It is not the function of our Government to keep
the citizen         from falling into error; it is the function of the citizen
        keep the Government from falling into error."
CYPHERPUNKS MUST BE THE JOHNNY APPLESEED OF THE INFORMATION AGE.
    the sleazeball, who intends to make J Edgar look like a piker
at     surveillance, has the gleam of unabridged power in his eyes.
Louis     F[reeh,uck] is charming, even disarming, as he tells a Congressional
    committee:
        "We are potentially the most dangerous agency in
the         country if we are not scrutinized carefully." (Jun
    meaning the FBI will be the most powerful [feared] federal
    really?  I thought it was already, although the DEA and BATF
have     worked hard for the title, too.
    Supreme Justice Louis O. Brandeis said:
        "The greatest danger to liberty lurks in insidious
encroachment         by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding."
    and the [London] Electronic Telegraph, on Sunday's front page:
        Mr. Freeh has won $370 million (ú230 million) of
        funding for 2,000 new posts, boosted the number of
        active agents to more than 11,000, and expanded
        open-ended "domestic security operations" from
100 in
        1995 to more than 800.  Twenty-three new FBI offices
        are opening abroad.
    and more:
        But none of this will contain the director's ambitions
        or his power.  He is now believed to be eyeing two
        other "secret police" forces - the Drug Enforcement
        Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
        - with a long-term view to a takeover.
    F[reeh,uck] holds the key to the Clinton's' ambitions; the
Clintons     cite the Roosevelts as their mentors; Hillary even communes
with the
    long dead Eleanor. Bubba's stated goals included extending
FDR's     "chicken in every pot" --he's just appeasing the
crowd now.
    Leopards do not change their spots, but Bubba has shifted
to the     right with public opinion; he is just like the leopard: playing
    his food until sufficient presidential powers have been accumulated
    by the default of Congress and the people.
    But, the INFORMATION REVOLUTION now stands in way of the Clinton
    plans; the Internet can destroy the media control now exercised
    the acquiescence of the five Jewish media barons. In fact,
it is     destroying their monopoly.
THE CONTROL OF INFORMATION IS THE CONTROL OF POWER.
    Why does F[reeh,uck] hold the key?  Because his job is to
sell the     Congress on strangling the information revolution before it
    truthless governments F[reeh,uck]'s masters understand and
    Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated on 4 Mar 33 stating:
        "I am prepared under my constitutional duty to         recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the
        midst of a stricken world may require.  These
        measures, or such other measures as the Congress may
        build out of its experience and wisdom, I shall
        seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring
        to speedy adoption.  But in the event that the
        Congress shall fall to take one of these two         courses, and in the event that the national
        emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the
        clear course of duty that will then confront me.  I
        shall ask the Congress for the one remaining
        instrument to meet the crisis broad Executive power
        to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the
        power that would be given to me if we were in fact
        invaded by a foreign foe."
    and, on 9 Mar 33, 5 days later, FDR extracted from an uniformed
    and essentially special session of Congress:
        "Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives
        the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
        Congress hereby declares that a serious emergency exists
        that it is imperatively necessary speedily to put into
        remedies of uniform national application."
    which was based on the War Powers Act (trading with the Enemy)
    1917 which was hastily revised to include US Citizens which
had been
    exempted. Next, FDR "franchised" the banks, "licensed"
    and so on. But, to render the citizens powerless and to confiscate
    all assets so the national state was the ultimate owner, and
    therefore able to pledge the people for credit to the international
    bankers, the fundamental monetary system changed:
        "Whenever in the judgment of the Secretary of the
        Treasury, such action is necessary to protect the         currency system of the United States, the Secretary         of the Treasury, in his discretion, may require any         or all individuals, partnerships, associations and         corporations to pay and deliver to the Treasurer         of the United States any or all gold coin, gold
        bullion, and gold certificates owned by such         individuals, partnerships, associations and         corporations."     which closed the loop and made every US citizen chattel as
FDR     pledged the good faith and credit of the United States to
the     international bankers --in return, an unbelievable flood of
credit     was available since the good faith and credit of the United
States     is "We the People...."  but FDR sold us downstream
into a debt     financed economy from which there is no escape; we are still
    the debt service is destroying any permanent economy AND total
    collapse under the debt load is bequeathed to our children.
    Congress repealed FDR's rubber stamp for the "President"
in 1973,
    but the War Powers Act remains, still modified to treat US
    citizens as the enemy. and the power of the "President"
to make     those regulations, and the automatic approval are enshrined
    current and future Presidents in Title 12 USC 95(b)
        "The actions, regulations, rules, licenses, orders
and         proclamations heretofore or hereafter taken, promulgated,
        or issued by the President of the United States or the
        of the Treasury since March the 4th, 1933, pursuant to
        authority conferred by subdivision (b) of Section 5 of
the Act
        of October 6, 1917, as amended, are hereby approved and
        confirmed."
    The real issue is the President and the fat cat power brokers
can     get away with these shenanigans __as_long_as_the_people_let_them__.
    We are still under the Rule of Necessity. We are still in
a declared
    state of national emergency, a state of emergency which has
    uninterrupted, since 1933.      FDR's licensing agencies were rather trivial in number; today
there     are thousands of them, many with their own administrative
courts.     FDR took away our common law when he bankrupted America, which
is a     national corporation under the Hague convention (courtesy
of Stanton
    and Seward after the Civil War).  Bankruptcy is a contract,
and     we are the bait, subject to that court, which is in effect
an     Admiralty court, and we are "licensed" to literally
exist by FDR's     Social Security Number schema. and every courtroom now flies
the     fringed Admiralty flag where habeas corpus is a privilege,
not a     right, if it exists at all.
    This is the importance of Louis F[reeh,uck].  He, and Janet
Reno as     the DOJ rubber stamp, are holding the collar for your neck.
    are selling it to you little by little, or even all at once.
    Why Louis F[reeh,uck]?  Madison Avenue style with credentials;
    can sell the program. F[reeh,uck] is the front man, the schill.
    Machiavelli, in his "Discourses of Livy," acknowledged
that great     power may have to be given to the Executive if the State is
    survive, but warned of great dangers in doing so.  He cautioned:
        Nor is it sufficient if this power be conferred         upon good men; for men are frail, and easily         corrupted, and then in a short time, he that is         absolute may easily corrupt the people."
    sleazeball's comments are scarfed by Congress, sleazeball's
    rocks their cradles, sleazeball shows them private morality
    about a populace running wild with crypto-anarchy, running
wild     to burn out the offices of central power...  in other words:
DEPRIVE THEM CONGRESSCRITTERS OF THEIR
 FREE LUNCH AND IMMUNITY.
    is it not odd that the more the government tries to abridge
our free
    speech rights, the more they want to confiscate our weapons?
        free speech is a weapon of democracy!
        privacy is a weapon of democracy!
        cryptography is a weapon of democracy!
    We are not fighting with guns and explosives this time, armed
    insurrection against the power of the Federal government is
    suicidal --we are fighting for our lives and the right to
live our
    lives with words: the ability to hear those words _before_
    government censors and spin doctors render them useless lies.
    Bubba can not win a war of truth and information; we can/
    The Marquis de Sade:
        Are not laws dangerous which inhibit the passions?         Compare the centuries of anarchy with those of the         strongest legalism in any country you like and you will
        see that it is only when the laws are silent that the
        greatest actions appear.
    however, anarchy is the key word that ignites even the ACLU
    your cause; it even makes bedfellows of Pat Buchanann and
    homosexual/priest/congressman from Massachusetts...      pure anarchy, by definition, does not work, anyway. forget
it. get     the concept out of your systems as it inflames everyone and
all     other reason is lost in the screaming and police batons.     Even Teddy Roosevelt called for the complete extermination
    anarchists, to be hunted like vermin. give it up; or go to
    private island and fly your rattlesnake flag. even Anguilla
will not
    tolerate anarchists.
    just give us our REAL constitutional rights as Franklin, Madison,
    Jefferson, Adams, and friends intended; give us constitutionalists
    on the Supreme Court, not bleeding hearts, statists, and central
    power freaks. get the Feds out of cradle to grave big government
    let the people determine their religion and morality.
    give us freedom of speech, freedom to bear arms, freedom from
    unreasonable searches, freedom not to incriminate ourselves,
and     repeal the 14th Amendment so we can have states' rights again.
    if our Constitution were permitted to govern as it was intended,
and     the states obeyed the precepts endowed to not further limit
    rights of the people, America would be the home of the free,
not big
    government, not freeloaders and the welfare state; not the
    of a once great nation.
    give us the rights Abraham Lincoln cherished lovingly:
     "Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for
    let _them_, not me, live the downside.
    George Washington, in his farewell address, warned:
       "... change by usurpation; for through this,         in one instance, may be the instrument of good,         it is the customary weapon by which free         governments are destroyed."
    cypherpunk philosopher kings: pick up your picks and shovels,
get     your hands dirty, and start digging in; it's going to be a
long and     difficult campaign and the tactics needed to expose F[reeh,uck]'s
    true intentions as the schill for the Clintons who are schills
    for the elitist leading the destruction of American democracy.
    The Congressional compromise love match season isn't over
yet; the
    schmoozers and lobbyists, like so many furry rats, still wander
    dark halls and tunnels looking for the last, late in the season,
    clandestine and obscene fuck.  any whore will do.
    lobbyists have long reputations for selling out the interests
    their paymasters; the lobbyists are so much a part of the
    culture that they have _no_ morality or moral position --it
is all
    about who they can claim to have influenced --what difference
    it make if it is contrary to the client --the art of the deal,
    protect their own position and find newer, richer clients
    logrolling and porkbarrel voting --but never go home without
a deal;
    used car salesmanship: get your man.
    I can hear the lobbyists whining now as they are called on
the     carpet:
        "aw, come on Mac, we got you a compromise from LEA
    never realizing that there is such an action as NO bill, they
sell     out half our rights blocking legislation which would never
    they claim they got back half. what half? --some unknown half
that     we _never_ lost!  that is why:
        The 10 Commandments contain 297 words. The Bill of Rights
is         stated in 463 words. Lincoln's Gettysburg Address contains
        words; and:         A recent federal directive to regulate the price of cabbage
        contains 26,911 words. (The Atlanta Journal)
    send the quisling Neville Chamberlains to the gas chambers!
    the public needs to be educated, not in crypto, but in the
horrors of         an oligarchy which intends to destroy the fundamental freedoms
on     which we stand.      publish his credit records; publish his medical records --tell
    neighbors about his visits from Child Protective Services...
    Joe Coach Potato will figure out he needs something
        AFTER he figures out there are fuckors and fuckees,
        and he's on the short end of that stick. [pardon my French]
    then, and only then, will the masses understand privacy --when
they     have lost it.     either we show the people before they lose everything to uncle,
    or...    just dump it on the table to show everyone just how
    uncle knows about _you_.
    Attila's thought for the day:
      Now, with a black jack mule you wish to harness, you
walk up,       look him in the eye, and hit him with a 2X4 over the left
eye.         If he blinks, hit him over the right eye! He'll cooperate.
          --so will politicians.
    Louis F]reeh,uck], did you really state this hoping everyone
would     think you are joking?         "We are potentially the most dangerous agency in
the         country if we are not scrutinized carefully."
    Louis F[reeh,uck], you obviously know that telling the truth,
before     the truth is really the truth, disarms your opposition since
they     can plainly see that it is not true.
    there is a limit to what you can endure before you must stand
to     be counted --so I will loudly echo Tim's sentiment: +When Cypherpunks are called "terrorists," we will
have done our jobs.
 --

no other."             --Benjamin Franklin

Anarchist Post of the Century
Crypto is hot in Washington. Don't think the battle's over; it's
This afternoon when the Senate Intelligence committee met
to consider a
new CIA deputy director, Sen. Bob Kerrey said "there's a
real urgency" to
get an encryption bill passed. (Presumably, that would be his
bill, the
"Key Escrow Infrastructure" McCain-Kerrey/S.909.) Anyone
still think that
the Senate will do the right thing on crypto? Think again...
* Last week Janet Reno talked at her weekly press conference
balancing law enforcement rights with privacy rights -- through
domestic key escrow.
* Yesterday Louis Freeh spoke at length before the House International
Relations committee about the spread of nuclear weapons... and
committee members about the problems the FBI has with nonescrowed
* Sen. Jon "Mandatory Domestic Key Escrow" Kyl said
on Sunday that the
Clinton administration's export controls on crypto were *not tight

            HEARING OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
        NOMINATION OF LT.-GEN. JOHN A. GORDON
        TO BE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
        CHAIRMAN:  SENATOR RICHARD SHELBY (R-AL)
        106 DIRKSEN SENATE OFFICE BUILDING
        WASHINGTON, DC
        2:00 P.M. EDT
        WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1997
SEN. KERREY:  I hope no doubt that you've heard of and perhaps
had the
opportunity to read the recommendations made by Senators Helms
Moynihan, but I think they're excellent.  It's an excellent examination
first, the need in some instances to classify, as well as the
need to
examine that classification system.
        It's not really a question, General Gordon.  I think it's
imperative that, on the issue of encryption, that the president
exert some
authority and try to pull together the congressional leaders and
say, "We
need a secure public network."  There's counter-intelligence
There's national security issues here at stake, obviously, balanced
the concerns for civil liberties and the concern for commercial
and the need to develop.
        But there's lots of action up here on the Hill, both in
the House
and the Senate, in half a dozen committees or eight or nine committees,
Lord knows how many altogether, more than I realized existed.
 And I think
there's a real urgency to get something passed both for the private
so they can have some stability, but also on the public-sector
side, so we
can protect the nation's interests.
        MR. GORDON:  Senator, I have not delved that deeply into
encryption issue.  I certainly take your point on this point.
 But I do
know that if the Senate does confirm me that that will be squarely
on my
        ATTORNEY GENERAL JANET RENO'S WEEKLY MEDIA AVAILABILITY
        U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
        WASHINGTON, DC
        THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1997
        Q     No, wait -
        ATTY GEN. RENO:  You've got to be quicker than that.
        Q     (Inaudible) - yes, ma'am.  Director Freeh and Director
Constantine both have complained that U.S.-made encryption devices
giving the drug cartels an advantage whereby interdiction becomes
Would you favor, as Mr. Freeh does, some kind of giving of the
keys to
these devices to the FBI and DEA?
        ATTY GEN. RENO:  I don't think that Director Freeh favors
keys to the FBI and to the DEA.
        Q     No?
        ATTY GEN. RENO:  What Director Freeh has talked about
is what we
have today - if someone is going to tap a phone, they don't just
go in and
tap the phone, if they're going to do it legally.  What law enforcement
does is it develops probable cause to believe that the telephone
is being
used to commit a crime and that to overhear would provide evidence
of a
crime.  That is submitted to a judge, both in federal court and
in many
states courts where wiretapping is authorized.  The judge reviews
sufficiency of the affidavits in support of the petition and enters
order directing the telephone company to provide that opportunity.
        What Director Freeh is hoping to achieve is the same thing
respect to encrypted products; so that the court would direct
that the key
be provided to the telecommunications system, or the other system,
in order
to decrypt the encoded message.
        What we're trying - what the administration is trying
to do is to
recognize that there are two important interests at stake here.
One is the
law enforcement interest, which is so vital with respect to terrorists,
with respect to being able to decrypt the drug dealer's computer
when I - I
can get a search warrant now and seize his black book and I can
read his
black book or decipher what he's talking about.  But if he can
encrypt the
information on his computer, that will be a significant obstacle
to law
        At the same time, the whole purpose of encryption with
telecommunication is to provide for the privacy interest, of commercial
interest of the average citizen.  And so I think it's important
that we
work together to ensure the law enforcement capacity and ensure
that the
present capacity to get court-ordered authorities for surveillance
continued and are made real, while at the same time ensuring privacy.
        Q     So you're saying that the phone company would have
responsibility?  Do they have the capability of encrypting?
        ATTY GEN. RENO:  The phone company doesn't have it.  There
would be
a system whereby a key would be provided through third parties
otherwise.  But this is something that we need to work together
on to
ensure that law enforcement interests are protected and that privacy
interests are protected as well.
        HEARING OF THE HOUSE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE
        SUBJECT:  ORGANIZED CRIME
        CHAIRED BY:  REPRESENTATIVE BEN GILMAN (R-NY)
        LOUIS FREEH, DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
        2172 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING
        WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1997
        10:00 A.M EDT
        REP.     :  Following up on what Mr. Hyde said on your
need to
fight international crime and terrorism, what do you need, as
an agency
director and for your agency, in terms of specifics to wage a
fight that
you can win?
        MR. FREEH:  Yes, sir.  As I mentioned in my statement,
I think we
need it on three levels.  We need the permanent and minimal FBI
overseas to develop the kinds of relationships that Dr. de Gennaro
and I
have had now for 18 years.
        We have asked for, and the Congress approved last year,
in August
of 1996, a plan to expand the FBI's Ligat (sp) program from approximately
23 to 43 Ligats.  That would call for, by the end of 1999, 146
agents in 42 different countries with 116 support employees. That's a
total of 262 people.  As I mentioned, the plan was submitted last
year.  It
wasn't just an FBI plan.  It was jointly submitted by the State
and the attorney general.  And we've asked for funding in the
1998 and 1999
budgets to reach that level.
        We've also asked for a continuation of the training. As I
mentioned, we've been able to train thousands of police officers
around the
world.  The benefit of that training is two-fold.  First of all,
we can
give them what they need most of all, which are the basic tools
to conduct
their own investigations.
        Just as importantly, we develop through those relationships,
as Dr.
de Gennaro described it, the cop-to-cop contacts and relationships.
 So an
FBI agent or a DEA agent can pick up the phone and speak to a
commander in Uzbekistan or Kazakhstan, if that's the place where
we need to
do our work.  So the training is a very important part of the
whole program.
        And again, and finally, we need the technological tools
to do our
work.  We have to be able to communicate rapidly and securely.
 We have to
deal with encryption.  We have to deal with cyber-crime.  And
those are all
part of a larger technological challenge which we're trying to
        REP. LINDSEY GRAHAM  (R-SC):  Thank you, John.
        Director Freeh, appreciate your testimony.  It's been
riveting, actually.  One of the briefing papers we have indicates
that the
American public, in a recent poll, whatever you want to take polls
say that 70 percent of the American people who were surveyed found
likely that the United States could be attacked by terrorist groups
the next decade using smuggled nuclear devices.  If you were asked
what category would you be in?
        MR. FREEH:  I think it's a threat and a possibility that
occupy our highest priority.  I think we've seen attacks certainly
Oklahoma, in New York City.  We know that many of the state sponsors
terror, including Iran, are rapidly and very aggressively acquiring
technology, both in terms of warheads and launching devices. We
know that
many of the state sponsors of terrorism, particularly Iran, sponsor
fund and control Hezbollah groups, including groups which have
and operations in the United States.
        So the links, although I don't think I've seen them in
a documented
form, clearly suggest that if a terrorist is willing to use a
truck bomb to
blow up a building with thousands of people at risk, the accomplishment
the particular objective would not be changed or influenced by
opportunity to use a much more devastating (nuclear?) or biological
chemical agent.
        So I think we have to take the possibility extremely seriously
we have to take drastic steps to try to prevent and detect that.

  Remarks by Senator Jon Kyl at the First International Conservative
                      Congress--September 28, 1997
     The Clinton Administration pursues a foreign policy without
     clear goals or the will to act decisively and is squandering
     the national security means left to it by a dozen years of
     Republican presidency. It emphasizes hope over reality and
     reliance on arms control agreements like the Comprehensive
     Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
     Treaty, and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) over a
     stronger defense. And political benefit over national
     security, as in its decisions to cave in to the concerns
     some in industry in irresponsibly relaxing export controls
     key items like encryption technology and supercomputers.

"Damn it, Baby!" the Tourette Tic grabbed his
elbow and rubbed it. Baby had never bitten him that hard before, and it hurt like hell.
"OK, I apologize for the sexist joke I emailed to all
of those poor, unsuspecting people."
The Tourette Tic knew that Baby had bitten him to keep him from
using the same chapter title, once again, but he also knew that
his sexist joke was what had put her in a bad mood to start with.
"And I'll use a different chapter heading for the next
chapter, OK?"
Baby sat down on the bed, and resumed chewing on the moose bone
she had brought home in the middle of the night from some poacher's
stash. She had made her point.
"People with Tourette Syndrome often get caught up in
repetitious cycles of thought and action." the Tourette
Tic was speaking to himself, now, since Baby was putting all of
her attention of the moose bone, wrestling it into submission
as it tried to escape her grasp.
"And sometimes we swear, too, you little cunt."
Baby put her bone down for a moment gave the Tourette Tic a cold
stare, challenging him to continue with this sexist line of thought.
"OK, I apologize." the Tourette Tic said, hastily,
but couldn't resist adding, "I forgot that you're on the
Baby trotted back to her bone and resumed her attack on it, having
disciplined her alleged master for giving rein to his sexist leanings.
"..." the Tourette Tic muttered,
glancing at Baby, nervously.
Baby pretended she hadn't heard that last comment, but she secretly
smiled as she continued pulling at a piece of sinew on the end
of the moose bone. He was lucky he had her around to keep him
on his toes, or there was no telling how far he would backslide
into the bowels of sexist bachelorhood.
"You can hardly blame him, though." Alexis spoke
the words that all of the members of the Magic Circle were thinking
as they read the last few chapters of 'InfoWar' that had been
submitted by the head of the 'Department of Redundancy Department.'
"True." the Cowboy agreed. "Ever since
Lying Fuck Louis Freeh made the mistake of tipping his hand, the
CypherPunks have risen to the challenge by inundating the list
with a plethora of perceptive and poignant posts."
"Cowboy!" Priscilla said sternly, "Are
you making fun of the tendency of people with Tourette Syndrome
to get caught up in alliteration, wherein they titillate their
tonsils, tending to repeatedly recite repartee redundantly representing
repetitive phrases?"
"Yeth." the Cowboy admitted, making fun of the
lisp that Priscilla had been blessed with as a child, only overcoming
the tendency in adulthood.
"OK, that does it..." Jonathan spoke up, shaking
his head at the inane attitude that the others had been projecting
since their last use of the Trei Transponder.
"I am going to reveal to the readers of Part III of The
True Story of the InterNet, just how depraved you people are,
by adding 'The Plot of the Platypus' to this chapter, and letting
them know that you all found it hilarious."
Bubba Rom Dos stood up, looking offended.
"I resent the implication," he said, "that
I am so insensitive as to laugh at the physical disabilities of
others. I just happened to think of something extremely funny
from my past, same time that I was reading 'The Plot of
the Platypus' missive."
"Me, too." Priscilla added, giggling. "I
was thinking of the first time that Bubba and I had sex."
The whole group roared with laughter. Jonathan took it as a sign
from the Tao that he should indeed add the suggested missive to
the chapter, in order to ensure that the readers of 'InfoWar'
would understand the truth spoken by Winifred G. Barton, founder
of the Bartonian Metaphysical Society and the Institute of Applied
Metaphysics, when she said, "Always take metaphysics
seriously. Never take yourself seriously."
"Nuke DC!" Bubba said, and called up the post
onto the GraphiScreen, whereupon Jonathan merged it with the message
to the sexist by A Dog To Be Named Earlier.

  Since the death of Dale Thorn, I have lurked silently in the
background while observing the creeping conspiracies continually
compromising cypherpunk costs.
  I mean..."posts." {Damn, now I'm doing it, too.}
Doing what, you ask? How did you know what I said? Are you with the MIND POLICE?  AM I SURROUNDED??!!!??
  {Oh...I see that I put that thought in brackets, where you could
   read it. Whew! Had me worried for a minute, there.}
  To continue...
  Being an anonymous coward who hides behind remailers the few
that I post, I have been somewhat hesitant, nonetheless, to reveal
the observations and accompanying thoughts about the direction
the cypherpunks lissed has taken {Damn, that's twice, already.
I may
be infected, like many of the others} since the end of the Nazi
moderation/censorship experiment.
  While other, more vocal, list members were celebrating the apparent
'victory' over the Johnboot of fascism being lifted from our typing
fingers, I had a troubled mind, worrying whether the evil forces
were truly vanquished or whether they had merely escaped by way
the anonymous remailers, to the negative pole, where they would
bide their time and prepare to strike again.
  I was counting on the shit-disturbers, chiefly Dale Thorn, to
keep a practiced eye out for signs of the evil farces {Was that
typo, a Freudian slip, or another sign of the mind infection that
is rapidly spreading on the list?} regrouping to once again try
to destroy the cypherpunks list.
  Suddenly, Dale disappeared--faster than you can say, "Jimmy
For a time, Toto attempted to carry on in his stead, but I *knew*
Dale Thorn, and Toto is no John F. Kennedy.
  {Shit! Now I'm beginning to steal and corrupt the words of others.
   I'm not certain I like the implications of this. The plot may
   even deeper than I previously thought...}
  Where was I...?
  Oh, yes...the Plot of the Platypus...
William H. Geiger III writed:
                            *^^*
Anonymous rote:
                 *^^*
  Then, in a startling development,
...                                        *^^^^^^^*
the url in my header.   Notice anything a little bit *strange* in the above quotes?
  Suddenly, "? the Platypus" is the only one of this
group that
can spell welfair...warfair......welfare.
  {Damn! What's that clinging to my back?}
  What is going on here? As the Platypus's spelling gets better,
other list members' spelling gets worse.
  For example:
Ray Arachelian sayhed:
         *^*
     *^^*
Tim May wroted:
in years.
put their

  The CypherPunk Philosophist King, lame-ing while flame-ing?
Worse yet, while flame-ing about lame-ing?
  Lame-ing while flame-ing about lame-ing? Fucking up his spelling
while taking a cheap-shot at someone's disability in their ability
'dis' someone with proper spelling?
  And then, after his "capitcal" misfire, the object
of his scorn returns fire with a correct spelling of "redistribution?"
? the Platypus correctly scripted:
in the...
  Am I making too much of this? A few simple typo's, you say?
an occasional slip of the finger--a momentary lapse of mind and/or
memory, leading to a misspelled word?
  {Or is it 'mispelled'? I don't know, and I'm afraid to look
it up.
   I could use the spell checker, but... No! It's too dangerous.}
  It's the Plot of the Platypus, I tell you...I AM NOT CRAZY!!!!
  I did extensive analysis of the list posts in the last few months,
and I can state with absolute certainty that for every slight
improvement in the quality of the Platypus's spelling, there is
a court responding decease in the Kuala-T of many of T ohter libsp
mambors spealing.
  {See? Do you SEE!?!? IT'S EVEN HAPPENING TO *ME* NOW.}
  That's not all. Just like before, others on the list are acting
the shills for the chief instant gator of this spelling tragivesty.
Bill Stewart, a conscienshous speller, said:
help   See? Do you SEE?!?
  The subtle slams by the co-conspirators are beginning. It's
next stage...
  "Having a little trouble with your spelling there, pal?
There's no
more censorship, so you can say anything you want...as long as
can SPELL it! Haaa...haaaa...haaa."
  The ebil fartses are once again attempting to split the cybferpukes
lissed in2 too kamps--the good spellers and the bag speelers.
  Think about it. Have you ever heard of "agraphia"
before? Ever known
anyone that had it? Of course not! It was developed in an underground
lavoratory in Area 51 by reptilian Nazis.
  Well, maybe not "reptilian", but Nazis, just the same.
  And LOOK! I'm using double-quotes! *Misplaced* double-quotes,
  THE MARKS OF THE *TOTO*!!!
  The conspiracy is spreading fast. It's everywhere. Kent Crispin,
government schill {Damn! I even spell 'shill' like Toto, now.
least I managed to use single quotes this time, like we did in
the old days, before the censorship crisis...which just 'happened'
to happen shortly after Toto happeared out of nowhere...}
  Where was I...? Oh, yes...
  Crispin, who has long previously been the target of many vicious
attacks by both Toto and the Platypus, is now showing signs of
the government generated Platyagraphia and the double-quote marks
of the Toto.
Kent Crispin  say-heyed:
citizens or die.                  ^    ^^^      ^
  Or is Kent Crispin, gubormint chill, marking funds of the wrist
of U.S.? Is he laughtering at uds B-hynd R backs?
  Is he a bubble agent in the Plop of the Paperplutz?
  Still skeptical? Wait!! There's more!!!
  {No, not the Ginsu knives, you fools. I'm talking about the
   of the Pretty Puss.}
  Think about the following pots, which wah *snot* sent to the
in order to hide the troops from the simplefucks lips dismemberers.
  Since it was not cent 2 the lips, I had to make it up, and now
I'm a forager, like Tutu making those bag fridgeries of ohter
cheaples pastes when he abuses their names without having their
parsimmons to accuse their name for making his own pissed to the
cyberhunks lost.

and blonde bimbos with huge breasts are getting ahead in life?
  Tired of not getting your secret cypherpunks decoder ring, like
the others, because you don't use an "authorized" operating

on it?

  knows about it--NOT EVEN ME! I had to make it up! That's how
  secret it is.}
  Good gays Finnish lost. Why do they "Finnish lost"?
Because they waste their time with correct spelling, proper placement
of quotation marks, and trying to develop a consistent list
persona when there are already millions of Internet identities
out there already, just waiting to be abused.
  Face it, it's the assholes that usually end up on top, and not
just because most people sleep on their stomachs. So why are
you WASTING YOUR TIME being a good gay, when the assholes are
making the BIG BUCKS by putting naked pictures of big bucks
fucking big butts on their "Native American Nude MLM"

TODAY, and you will be guaranteed a secret cypherpunks decoder
ring when the people who pull our strings pass a law criminalizing
them (except for use in meeting the legitimate needs of secret
conspirators against the cypherpunks list).
  Listen to what these Secret Conspirators have to say:
Peter Trei:
  "Hi. I used to be a boring guy. I was so boring that none
of the assholes on the list even bothered insulting me, or forging posts
my name.
  "Then one day, my life suddenly changed. Someone forged
a post to the list in my name, and it was exciting. It was like getting
at gunpoint. What a rush!
  "When I woke up the next morning, I couldn't face going
back to my
normal, moral, ethical, boring life. I sent an anonymous post
to the
list--as TruthMonger! It felt good, like being elected to a government
office by lying to people, but I wanted MORE. I began forging
posts to
the list using other people's identities. If they complained to
list, then I killed them, and assumed their list identities. It
like driving INSLAW into bankruptcy, stealing their software,
murdering those who knew too much!
  "Now I am Peter Trei, boring cryptographer, by day, but
I am any
exciting, unethical asshole I want to be, at night.
  "I liked the SECRET CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE CYPHERPUNKS
LIST so
much that I *stole* the conspiracy. "? the Platypus"
has nothing
to do with the Plot of the Platypus, I'm just making fun of his
disability, like a real asshole. Toto has nothing to do with it,
either. He's such a loser that everyone on the list can spot his
forgeries. (Well, they "used to could". But now that
I can mimic
his style and have hacked his Sympatico account, I can deny all
of this from my real list persona tomorrow, and nobody will be
the wiser.)
  "I'm not just a user of the cypherpunks list, I'm an abuser."
Kent Crispin:
  "This isn't Peter's conspiracy, its MINE! I mean, get real,
work in a secret underground lavoratory as a government shill.
  "Think about it. Who would you expect to conspire against
bunch of anarchists...the government! You all know how much I
love the government and authority. I'm Louis Freeh's secret
lover. Janet Reno is going to have my baby.
  "It's me! *I* am the one behind the SECRET CONSPIRACY AGAINST
THE CYPHERPUNKS LIST. I'm a STATIST, for God's sake, why won't
you believe me?   "Because I'm not one of the elitist 'chosen?' Fuck you."
Tim May:
  "God, I *love* this list."
Robert Hettinga:
  "Hey! If you check the archives, you'll find that I said
that in a post, long before anyone else did."
  "Now Hettinga is stealing Tim May's lines. What the hell
is going on, here? Has *everybody* on this list gone crazy?
  "*I* am the one who is *really* behind the SECRET CONSPIRACY
AGAINST THE CYPHERPUNKS LIST. Think about it. Everyone knows
that I'm a 33rd degree Mason.  No...that's Tim May.
  "Fuck this shit. From now on, I'm posting as Toto."
John Perry:
  "This has gone on long enough. I'm killing this thread.
...I mean..."post." ...I mean...
  "Shit! I'm not the list moderator, yet. That's *after*
take over the list."
  "Sorry."

~~~~~~~ Begin Note From Igor ~~~~~~~
Do you all remember the Perl script I was working on for mimicking
posts of other people? Well, this post is the latest product of
script. What do you think? Is it convincing? Did you really believe
that it was actually written by one or more of the people mentioned
in the post?
I think that I finally have the Perl script to the point where
I can
effectively fool most people about the true source and method
of a
computer generated post's actual origins.
  I was thinking about adding a conspiratorial part about myself.
I was
going to intimate that the fact that I was so active on the list
the censorship crisis, playing the skeptic who was gradually brought
around to the truth of Dale Thorn and Toto's claims, then volunteering
to host the list and quietly disappearing into the background,
indicate that *I* was really behind the SECRET CONSPIRACY AGAINST
CYPHERPUNKS LIST.
  In the end, I decided against it, because then the readers would
left with the notion that perhaps even this explanatory note from
was bogus, and that there really was an ongoing SECRET CONSPIRACY
AGAINST THE CYPHERPUNKS LIST.
~~~~~~~ End Note From Igor ~~~~~~~
THERE IS *NO* SECRET CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE CYPHERPUNKS
        There is no conspiracy by a secret government to destroy
        the Constitution, enslave the people, and rule the world.
        Individual cypherpunks are not being imprisoned and murdered
        and replaced with Identity Bots. There is no need to worry.
        Declan McCullagh can confirm all of this. You can trust
        He is your representative in D.C. He did *not* give secret
        testimony against Jim Bell in return for a byline in the
        "Time" magazine cover story. That is just a
rumor. Well, not
        yet, maybe, but it will be, very soon.
        Remember, this is just a normal mailing list with a few
        members who are a little odd. There are no spooks. There
        no background intrigue. This whole privacy thing has just
        blown a bit out of proportion. It's really not that important.
        Waco was just a tragic accident. Ruby Ridge was a simple
        in judgment by a government agent who really feels bad
        following his superiors orders. Heavily armed U.S. Marines
        no match for a goat-herding boy with a .22, and it is
