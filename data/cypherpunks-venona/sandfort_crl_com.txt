Hey C'punks,
Was everyone too busy arguing about "freedom of the press" to note a real act of Cypherpunk stealth?  While some of you were rehashing WWII, Cypherpunk co-founder, John Gilmore, was slipping cryptography between the lines in a news item about the "information superhighway."  The item was about a "new" way to protect against (dare I say it?) pseudospoofing. Perhaps John will honor us with an official description of Cygnus Support's new software.

What I was discussing are "pre-paid" calling cards.  You can buy Western Union cards at any Western Union representative office.  AT&T cards are available at AT&T Phone Stores.  Other brands are also available .  I  recently saw another such card being advertised in the camara section of Pay Less Drugs.  I also mentioned another brand (Telekey) in one of my "Norman French" articles in MONDO 2000 last year.  Their phone number is (800) You buy them with cash.  They each represent a pre-set number of minutes in an already established account.
They can be used from any phone, but since you have to call an 800 number to use them, some record of your calling number may be captured by ANI (Automatic Number Identification) and kept by the card company.

If your total overseas accounts aggregate under $10,000, the correct answer to the IRS is "NO."  For amounts over $10k, well, they have to find them first, don't they?  *Insurance* and *annuity* policies aren't reportable at all.  Give you any ideas?

This is brilliant.  I love it!  But . . .
The idea is to create a unit of currency whose value is convenient for typical transactions.  Some amount that is easily grasped by the average person.  Originally the US dollar was 1/20th of an ounce of gold.  That amount of gold, today, has the buying power of US$18, or so.  A bag of groceries more or less.  The amount of gold determines the total value of the money supply, but the number of people and transactions in which it must take part determines the number and denomination of bills and coins to be printed and minted.
No, no, no.  This is a common falacy.  It is the *change* in the amount of money in circulation that constitutes inflation or deflation.  If there were only one ounce of gold in the whole world, it could easily back any amount of economic activity.  Just the ratio of gold to currency would change.
There is nothing anymore abstract here than, say, using different systems
of weights to measure your gold.  1 troy oz. = 31.103+ gms.  Just like
saying, "US$1 is defined as 1/20th troy oz. of gold."  Nothing too abstract
about that. Nothing symbolic about it.  Gold has value because people value it.  Just like potato chips and romance novels.
No, the owners own it.  The owners may exchange certificates of ownership for other property.
Not being used?  I thought the gold was supporting commerce.
Or other lumps of "stuff."  Property is wealth.  But in the Market Place of Ideas, for instance, other "currencies" are paramount, and so it goes.

people living in the service territories of the various access providers. ID Anonymous, Ltd. collects monthly fees from all of its sub-users.  It
pays the Internet provider a single check each month for the monthly fees
of all its anonymous account.  Under such a system, there is no weak link.  If a user misbehaves, DGS or Netcom can cut off the offending account, but nobody can reveal the identity of the underlying user.  By being located in an offshore jurisdiction, ID Anonymous, Ltd. is not susceptible to lawsuits or rubber hose techniques.  QED.

I would use it in the same way I would use an oncoming truck; if someone were trying to mug me, I would consider pushing them in front of the truck.  It would just be a handy tool to be employed for self-defense.  So to the government often is useful as a handy blunt instrument to keep other forms of muggers at bay.

It does.  I saw something about in Popular Science, I think.  It strategically placed microphones to triangulate the origin of the shots.
There aren't many sounds that are really that similar to gun shots.  For one thing most rounds are supersonic unlike firecrackers and car backfires.
There really is no such thing as a "silencer" outside of the movies.  *Sound supressors* work marginally well for subsonic rounds.  They are pretty much useless for supersonic rounds.
Please.  This is the purest nonsense.  The microphone system only works well enough to get the cops to the general vacinity of the shooting.  However the real issue is legal presumptions and liability.  Ain't gonna happen here pardner.

Recently, the White House sent Stewart A. Baker, general counsel
for the National Security Agency (NSA), to the annual Computer,
Freedom and Privacy Conference in New York City to speak about
the Clinton Administration's desire to safeguard the government's
ability to eavesdrop on every American.  At that conference, Mr.
Baker posed the question:  "Do you want to live in a world where
law enforcement cannot do its job because of the need for
Everyone who cherishes his constitutional rights should answer,
"Absolutely."  The Orwellian, or Al Gorewellian, technology that
would foster the government's ability to eavesdrop on its cit-
izens is essentially a microcircuit that the Administration want
all American telephone and computer companies to install in their
products.  The microcircuit, dubbed the "Clipper" chip, scrambles
all electronic communications between individuals, resulting in
gibberish to outsiders--all outsiders, that is, but the federal
government.  The plan to implement the Clipper chip is an insult
to the American people and its realization would erode the Fourth
Amendment rights of all citizens.
As usual, presuming Americans have no more sense than Yahoos, the
administration has presented the Clipper chip in the guise of a
plan to protect individuals from invasions of their privacy.
According to the NSA, because telephone conversations and compu-
ter transmissions are becoming so easy to tap, the White House
would like to offer the Clipper chip to shield everyone from such
unwanted interferences.
In reality, the Feds want to see a uniform standard in the type
of computer software that secures electronic communications.  The
reason for this is that people are already protecting their con-
versations with a variety of privately-supplied devices, and the
FBI, CIA and NSA cannot and will not be able to penetrate such
With the Clipper chip, everyone has the same lock on his communi-
cations.  Unfortunately, the government has the keys.  The Amer-
ican people can do without the overwhelming generosity of this
When Charles Freeh, FBI director, testified before the House
Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology and the Law, he said that
the chip is necessary because the police and national security
agents are falling behind advances in criminal technology.  How-
ever, no one has offered evidence that a trend of criminals or
terrorist using scrambled communications to pass unlawful plots
exists, or reasons why a criminal sophisticated enough to use
cryptography would be dumb enough to use an American made tele-
phone or computer containing the Clipper chip.
Worse, the implementation of the Clipper chip would erode the
right to be free from illegal searches and seizures under the
Fourth Amendment.  According to the President's plan, both the
Commerce and Treasury Department would hold keys to unscramble
electronic communications, operating as a "key escrow" system.
The government would no longer be aiming wiretap technology at
specific individuals or specific locations.  The presumption
would be that everyone is a criminal.  Because only two keys
partition people's privacy from governmental seizing electronic
documents without prior notification is great.
If the White House truly desires to use technology for the bene-
fit of all, it should mandate the use of a different computer
chip.  How about one called the Clinterceptor that would act as a
sort of modern-day Paul Revere.  Through the information super-
highway, the Clinterceptor would forewarn the public that the
government is about to invade their privacy.  Thus, the next time
President Clinton and his college roomies are burning the
midnight oil and come up with a hair-brained idea like the
Clipper chip, an alarm will sound and alert the American people
to the government shaking the shackles of the Constitution.

We got to see lots of scenes of Cat and other nubiles jogging, doing jumping jacks, push ups and, best of all, shooting strange large caliber automatic weapons.
The crypto part?  Oh, yeah, right.  Anyway, the trafficers (ex-KGB types) were transmitting date, time and location information to associates in Miami.  Communications was via a series of numbers read in the clear over shortwave radio.  For some reason, the H.E.A.T. guys new that the "key" was a ten-digit number that was the *same* every time!  Since the KGB guy had once been busted by the CIA, H.E.A.T. finally guessed that the key was the CIA's phone number.  No kidding.
There was some other minor computer stuff, but the important values were preserved:  Alison and other babes did callisthenics, there was lots of gun play and Fabio did *not* "act" in this episode.

There's a pretty good article about the privacy debate in the
July/August issue of BEYOND COMPUTING.  The article, "Technology
and Government:  The Battle Heats Up," is by Dr. H. Jefferson
Smith.  It appears in the "ethics" section.  Mostly it was a
once-over-lightly, but at least it never mentioned kiddie porn,
narcotraffickers, pedophiles nor terrorists.  It was fairly even
handed in its presentation.
The article ended with these paragraphs:
    . . . On one level, discussions of an individual's
    rights--such as the right to conduct private conversa-
    tions without a threat of government intrusion--are
    pitted against the worthy goal of an efficient and safe
    society.
    On a deeper level, a potentially more perplexing dilemma
    is at play:  Should our government interject itself into
    technological advances to achieve some socially desir-
    able outcome?  And, if so, who should determine which
    outcome should be sought?
Of course, we know the Cypherpunk answers, but at least other
folks are looking at the issues.  Onward and upward.

For liberals, I would examine some pet cause and examine the consequences of that cause becoming "illegal."  For instance, if your friends are "pro choice," you might ask them what they would do if the right to lifers outlawed abortion.  Would they think it was wrong for a rape victim to get an abortion just because it was illegal?  How would they feel about an abortion "underground railroad" organized via a network of "stations" coordinated via the Internet using "illegal encryption"?  Or would they trust Clipper in such a situation?
Everyone in America is passionate about something.  Such passion usually dispenses with mere legalism, when it comes to what the believer feels is a question of fundamental right and wrong.  Hit them with an argument that addresses their passion.  Craft a pro-crypto argument that helps preserve the object of that passion.

Let's keep our eyes on the prize.  Courts will do what courts will do.  Maybe someone will shoot us up with sodium pentathal, maybe not.  The real point of Cypherpunks is that it's better to use strong crypto than weak crypto or no crypto at all.  Our use of crypto doesn't have to be totally bullet proof to be of value.  Let *them* worry about the technicalities while we make sure they have to work harder and pay more for our encrypted info than they would if it were in plaintext.

Actually, yes, for two reasons:  First, they cannot overtly break the law.  Other groups of thugs such as the FBI, the justice system, etc. will take umbridge if their turf is invaded.  Second, though the NSA must have its share of evil people, they must also have their share of decent folks.  Decent folks would include whistleblowers who could blow the cover of the NSA's bad folks.  Hell, they might even use strong crypto routed through anonymous remailers!
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^ All actions have costs.  How badly do they have to want it to risk exposure to public/legal scrutiny?  Even if they want it that much, must we assume they have no compunctions?  Calm down.  If the world were as lopsided as some of us seem to think, we would all be in jail or in the ground.

Not a flame here, but a slight difference of opinion.  The admonition,

The error in Tim's analogy between his income tax example standard privacy techniques is that the techniques have already passed the test of time.

I've seen it done--year in and year out.  It's real, folks.

Today's episode of "Acapulco H.E.A.T." was a treasure trove of
privacy and technology issues.
The story was about a renegade biologist who had "supplied both
sides with biological weapons in the Iran-Iraq war."  It seems
he's now living in South America where he owns a casino and--in
his spare time--is using genetic engineering to create an army of
super-soldiers.  The only example we see, though, is a steroidal
acromegalic who looks like a young Arnold (he has some sort of
European accent, too).
H.E.A.T. "hack" the casino's computers to give themselves a
million dollar line of credit.  In the meantime, they use a
homing device they plant on the bad guys van, they find his
secret jungle lab where they plant a microcam to spy on the bad
guy's genetic operation.
Through the use of a room bug the *fire* into an exterior wall
with a rifle, they learn that the bad guy and an accomplice use
marked cards, which can be read with special contact lenses, to
cheat at chemin de fer.  Using a special hand-held electronic
lock pick, our heroes defeat a card-key hotel lock and break into
the room in which the marked cards are kept.  There, they
substitute their own marked deck.
After that, a fortune gets won, things get blown up, machine-guns
are fired, truth and justice prevail.  The usual.
While this episode had no bikinis, it also had no Fabio.  As they
say in Blackjack, it was a "push."

On Sun, 17 Jul 1994, Jeff Gostin wrote, first quoting me:
Johnson said words to the effect that, "The United States has no plans to
remove silver from its coinage, now or in the future."
Nixon promised something along the lines, "The United States would never end the free covertability of the dollar to gold."
Both of these statements were made no more than two months before the US stopped making silver coins, and closed the gold window.  When asked why the denials were made and then violated, both administrations said it was to maintain order.  They didn't want "speculators" to start runs on silver or gold.  See?  The government lied to us for our own good.
WHAT AM THE MORAL OF THE STORY, UNCLE REMUS?
When the government makes any announcement (ESPECIALLY a denial), you
should figure out what the government is trying to get you to do--and do
the opposite.  Contrarianism with a vengance.  Of all the advice I've offered on the Cypherpunks Channel, this is absolutely the most certain.

 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On the noon news in San Francisco, there was an item of crypto
interest.  It was about something I think they called the "Code
Grabber."  It is a device which receives and records the coded
RF signals used to remotely unlock car and garage doors.
The hand-held unit is a little larger than a paperback book.  It
has a half dozen switches on it.  After you intercept someone's
code, you can play it back anytime to control that person's car
lock or garage door.  It's kind of like a TV universal remote.
Some politicos have already started talking about banning it, but
I think just the publicity will guarantee a healthy black market
in such devices.  The public will be clamoring for a solution.
Enter the Cypherpunks.
How can this nifty burglary tool be outsmarted?  How about a
replacement system that uses strong crypto?  The Code Grabber
represents a great opportunity for an inventive Cypherpunk to
make some money AND promote crypto awareness.
The questions are:  Could standard auto and garage door openers
easily be retrofitted?  Could a "crypto remote" with its own CPU
be made small enough to fit into a hand-held unit?  Could such a
system be made for a reasonable cost?
 S a n d y

SANDY SANDFORT
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I was just thinking about computer seizures and thefts.  I think
I've come up with a couple of interesting solutions.
REMOTE CONTROL--In addition to denying access to your files by
encrypting, you might want to *change* them in some way *after*
your computer has been seized/stolen.  Pagers are cheap.  They
can be pinged no matter where they are located in their service
area.  They can be accessed from any phone (even a jailhouse
payphone).  And they are small enough to be wired into your
computer.  It souldn't be too difficult to fix it so your
computer can read transmitted numbers from the pager's memory.
Code numbers could be used to tell your computer to take various
actions.  Depending upon your circumstances, you could tell your
computer to decrypt this or that set of files, to reformat the
hard drive, to fry the CPU, etc.
LITTLE BROTHER INSIDE--Even better than a pager, would be a cell
phone.  It would be more expensive, but also more versatile.  In
addition to giving instructions to your computer, a cell phone
could be used to *eavesdrop* on the location where your computer
is being held.  By disabling the ringer and remounting the
mouthpiece, you could surreptitiously call your computer, any
time, from any phone and monitor conversations in the area.  (To
paraphrase an old military curse, "bug the bugging buggers.")  As
long as the computer is plugged in, the cell phones batteries
will continue to be topped off.  (For the truly thorough privacy
advocate, a GPS unit could be hooked into the cell phone to give
you its location.)

And one way to do this that fits in with my original post is via a pager-delivered instruction.  Prior to seizure/theft, you would make an arrangement with an offshore "escrow agent."  After seizure you would send your computer the instruction that says, "encrypt my disk with the escrow agents public key."  After that, only the escrow agent could decrypt your disk.  Of course, the escrow agent would only do that when conditions you had stipulated were in effect.

Just to play Devil's Advocate, here is another twist to this "passphrase

more serious offense about which the government knows nothing.  If your
passphrase not only admitted the crime, but gave information which could
lead to corroboration of the admission, you could arguably withhold the
passphrase. As an example, your passphrase could be:
"I decline to answer on the grounds that my passphrase is a statement which may tend to incriminate me.  I will only give my passphrase if I am given immunity from prosecution for the actions to which it alludes."

I don't think much is accomplished by arguing which set of liars got us
into any particular mess.  However, it was the *democrats* who dominated
the legislative and judicial branchs of government, as well as the
entrenched bureaucracy for the Ragan/Bush years.  I think that is a more
accurate version of "giving credit where credit is due."  Nevertheless,
please be advised, I dispise them all (and so should you).

I have completed my journey across the continent and am now ensconsed in the Greater Gotham Metropolitan Area.  I can still be reached at all my old e-mail addresses (ain't technology great?).
Last night, Duncan, his wife, Lois, and I enjoyed a fine dinner in "the
Village" with Heroes of the Revolution, Matt Blaze and Eric Hughes.  The
food was good; the waitress was cute; maybe this East Coast thing will
work out. Duncan and I will commence the Privacy Seminar sometime next week, or as soon as I overcome truck lag.  (Hey, you try driving 3,000 miles {5,000 kilometers for our non-US list members} sometime.  It's exhausting.)

 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
    Most customers want more privacy, but when you think
    about it, there is not a whole hell of a lot they can do
    about it right now.  If they want to get the status and
    flexibility of a credit card, they need to give up their
    privacy....
    At this point Duncan Frissel will regail us with some
    wonderful scheme, understandable only to lawyers, that
    can be used to get credit cards under aliases, perfectly
    legal if you use a doubly nested corporate structure
    going through Aruba and the Caymans,...I won't comment
    on why most consumers have neglected that option....
Well, I imagine that is because he doesn't have a clue what he is
talking about.  In our upcoming Privacy Seminar, Duncan and I
will discuss trivially simple ways to do just the thing Mr. Hart
tells us can't be done.  And, as Duncan says, "it'll be as legal
as church on Sunday."  Tune in to the Privacy Channel, Jim, you
might actually learn something.
The Privacy Seminar will start approximately 1 September.  An
announcement giving instructions on how to sign up will be made
sometime this week.  Stay tuned.

SANDY SANDFORT
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'm so happy.  I've found Acapulco H.E.A.T. in the New York area
(18:00 Saturdays, channel 9).  Time for another review.
This week's episode, "Code Name: Archangel," had a couple of
relevant privacy items, and it was a "no Fabio" zone, as well.
Bikinis and gun battles were at a minimum, but those that were,
were equally divided between the sexes.
Anyway, a neo-Nazi (with a really baaad German accent) named
"Steinholtz" planned to steal one of the da Vinci "archangel"
panels which was being exhibited in Mexico.  It was to be
reunited in Germany with the three other panels.  The idea was
that this would be a symbol for the reunification of all the
neo-Nazis, and would inaugurate the beginning of the Fourth
Reich.  A clandestine, world-wide, TV broadcast of the stolen
panel would be used to unify the Nazis.
There were also two subplots: one involving a Dutch Mata Hari
type, and the other involving two of the H.E.A.T. members.  ("Hey
Tommy, I don' wan' jew dating my seester.")
Anyway, since the bad guys use "antibugging devices," our heroes
had to use hand-held through-the-wall mikes to listen in on their
plans.  Later, they were able to install a "sprinkler cam" right
over the swastika covered table around which the plotters sat.
(Curiously, the swastika they showed was a left-handed version of
the actual Nazi one.  No explanation given.)
Our guys also had to scope out the church where the panel was
being exhibited.  There they found infrared heat/motion detectors
which they foiled by wearing (heat conserving) wet suits.  Hmmm.
The panel was also protected by pressure sensitive mats and
electronic eyes, but no guards!
The last bit of technological chicanery came after the bad guys
were captured.  Using digital technology, the team spoofed the
voice of Steinholtz and had him saying we should all live as
brothers.  Does was done as a voice-over to scenes from the
Mexican festival of Santa Guadeloupe or some such.  Gag.
 S a n d y
PS  The Stateside boss of H.E.A.T. is played by John Vernon who
    was "Dean Wormer" in Animal House.  He only communicates
    with the team via encrypted videophone.  It's obvious
    (due to some differences in dialog, pronunciation, etc.)
    that his scenes are not filmed at the same time or place
    as the rest of the show.  In one episode, he kept
    referring to "M15" ("em fifteen") while the team talked
    about "MI5" ("em eye five").

    I guess it boils down to this, we have to have someone
    that we can trust. The issue of currency conversion
    would also be a new one for me.  Would my money be
    Swiss?  If the transaction gos south, what do I do, I am
    no longer covered by US law and would have no proof that
    this transaction ever took place (remember, no one can
    ask the bank for records). Hmmmm
Your money in a Swiss based bank would be Swiss if that's what
you wanted.  Almost certainly, you would have additional options
for your "unit of accounting."
Though US law might not help you, it is not true to say that "no
one can ask the bank for records."  You can.  The proof that a
transaction (such as a deposit) took place, is the digitally
signed receipt you get from the bank.  It is VERY good proof.

No, I didn't forget about Acapulco H.E.A.T.  This week's episode
was, "Code Name: Stranded."  In this installment some of the Team
boat off to an "uninhabited" Mexican island for a picnic and R&R.
Of course, they forget to anchor the boat so they get stranded.
To make matters worse, their is a loony Viet Nam vet (is there
any other kind?) on the island who still things he's in 'Nam.
Well, it goes pretty much as you would expect:  gunfire, snake
attack, poisonous spider attack, exploding hut and bikinis.
There is *only* one crypto tie-in (and it's a stretch).  They
communicated an SOS to the remaining Team members by juryrigging
an old field radio without a microphone, so that they could send
Morse code.  No Fabio, plenty of exposed Alison Armitage.

SANDY SANDFORT
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This week's episode, "Code Name: Stalemate," was a two-parter.
The Team goes to Venezuela to protect Andre Sokal, an ex-KGB
agent, who is playing in a big chess tournament.  Andre in now
part of the Russian reform movement and Communist hard-liners
want to assassinate him.
H.E.A.T.'s archenemy, Strake, is hired to do the job.  Strake is
a violent but sensitive megalomaniac who eschews a simple bullet
to the head because a good assassination is "a theatrical
performance that must show the genius of the assassin" or
something like that.
Strake first shoots one of the real chess players in the back,
which shows curiously little genius.  He then replaces him with a
surgically altered double.  It goes downhill from there.
The crypto and hi-tech angles are many.  Ashley (Catherine
Oxenberg, who I have been told was *not* Ringo's wife) replaces
one of the other chess players.  (No, she doesn't shoot her in
the back, they were old friends.  Ashley just happens to play at
the grandmaster level and anyway, Chrissie will be feeding her
computer generated moves via a radio receiver in Ashley's
eyeglass frames.  Strake's ringer is also strategically impaired
and so Strake is helping him with a laptop with a screen that
only the double can see because he is wearing special glasses.
(Why not just use an LCD screen?  Nobody can read those things
Unfortunately, Strake has brought in an electronics communication
expert from Russia (Ivan something-or-other).  Ivan spoofs the
H.E.A.T. computers and satellite communications uplinks.  When
the Team discovers their communications have been compromised,
Mike tells Ashley not to use their normal communications until
the system is secure.  When she asks how should communicate, Mike
tells her to "use the phone."  (Now *that's* secure!)
Ivan is available to Strake, because his research funding dried
up when the USSR went belly up.  Too bad, because "he was on the
verge of developing a microchip which would have been able to
decrypt any secure computer."  Yeah, right.
To be continued next week.

collective defense.  Sometimes it actually it actually has to
perform its advertised defense function.  Like naked quarks,
purely defensive governments cannot exist.  They are bipolar by
nature, with some poles (i.e., the bullying part) being "more

Alan Olsen still thinks totalitarians can succeed in industrial
    ... But it is also the case that industrial countries,
    when they fall on hard times tend to fall back on an
    authoritarian "bread and circuses" approach to
    governing.
Examples, please.  Fascism in 1930's Germany was certainly NOT
one such government.  National Socialism, of course, had its
"bread" aspect, but their were no "circuses" in the Roman sense.
While Bread and Circuses is one technique to keep a population in
line, it is quite separate from the military/police state method
chosen by the NAZIs.  In any event, NAZI Germany supports the
proposition that modern totalitarianism, by its nature, must be
short lived.  How long did the "Thousand Year Reich" last?
    ... We have the control freaks just wating to gain the
    power and more waiting in the wings.  They have the
    money and they have the technology....
"They," again?  I thought it might be "them."  The Illuminati,
right?  Or is it the Trilateral Commission, the Jesuits, or the
CIA?  Who are these control freaks who "have the money and ...
the technology"?  Jeez, and some call me paranoid for being a
privacy advocate.
When I wrote, "There will be some temporary, local setbacks in
the coming years, and have some mopping up to do, but we've
already won." Alan responded:
    Don't be too smug yet...  There are people in power who
    have not figured out that totalitarian states cannot
    survive.... Logic and reason have nothing to do with the
    "thought patterns" of these people.
Roadrunner logic.  Wiley Coyote runs over the edge of a cliff.
Miraculously, he is suspended in the air until he makes the
mistake of looking down.  Only when he becomes aware of his
predicament does he fall.  My point still is, the totalitarians
don't have to figure out anything; their "thought patterns" are
irrelevant; reality still rules.  They will not survive.
    Besides, it is not their money they are spending on
    this.  It is yours.
Are you sure they're spending *my* money?  With each advance in
privacy technology, they have less access to *anyone's* money.
    As far as I have been able to determine, the only thing
    that you can do with a control freak is to kill him
    before he obtains any position of power.  (Or wrap him
    in duct tape and feed him lots of Thorazine(tm).)
Or, with a little ingenuity, you could structure your life so you
could just ignore him.  Living well is the best revenge.

    With your name and address someone can find out what
    your date of birth is. In many states that is enough for

Federal agencies such as the FBI, and most if not all states, use
your NAME and DATE OF BIRTH as their primary means of locating
you in their databases.  When it comes to being charged with
giving false information to the authorities, it could be argues
that you "accidentally" misremembered or forgot your SSN.  It
would be a real stretch, though, to assert that you got your own
name or birthday wrong.
If you are stopped by the police, you are required to identify
yourself if asked.  Is your DOB required?  May you decline to
answer that question if it is not relevant to the stop?  (To
drive a car, to buy booze, you much be of requisite age.  Maybe
you could say, "I'm over 21, officer.")  I don't know if it's

Where do I begin?  Jim Choate has now retreated into subjectivism
rather than
Come on, Jim, you've been arguing that totalitarians can ignore
economics.  Answer my questions.  How long did the "Thousand Year
Reich" last?  What totalitarian states can you name that have had
any legs at all?  There are none.
    I take it you don't take the comparison between the
    Roman circuses where prisoners and other misfits (ie
    Christians) were fed to the lions and and the Tutonic
    cirucses of the 30's and 40's (ie prison or relocation
    camps) where the criminal and other misfits (ie Jewish)
    were fed to the masochistic 'system' as comparable? The
    Warsaw Ghetto was not a form of 'circus' then?
No, of course not.  The Roman circuses were public spectacles.
They were a form of entertainment (like professional sports
today).  Their propose was to distract the populace, not to
eliminate enemies of the state.  That's what Crucifixion and
other types of execution were for.  Often, the participants were
pros, free men who did it for gold and glory.  Hell, Rome wasn't
even a totalitarian state.  Where do you get these ideas?  The
Nazis were another matter, but they still didn't make the cut.
Show me your successful totalitarian states.
    'They' are the persons with money and influence and have
    also made it in their best interest to sustain the
    status quo. Just take a look at the Federal Reserve and
    how they manage the money in this country. Take a look
    at the special interest political groups who make it
    their job to get law-makers to look at it 'their' way.
I've looked.  I repeat, who are "they"?  You know, like some
names.  They can't be too powerful, since social/cultural/legal
non-compliance is a growth industry.  God, what the hell are
you so afraid of?
    Just exactly whose reality are we talking about ruling
    here?...  people do not analyze their choices the same
    way  you analyze some physical problem like building a
    bridge....
But that's the point.  Economics *is* like building a bridge.
You can't spend money you don't have.  You can't create wealth by
printing money.  There are rules, and no amount of subjectivism
or Roadrunner logic will exempt totalitarian states from them.
But if you disagree, please prove me wrong by naming the states
that have "created their own reality."  I bet you can't.
    I can assure you that the folks out there will spend
    their money if it is clear that they will make more of
    it in the long run. While it is true that public monies
    are the easiest to spend because of its anonymity it is
    not the only resource that is there. Consider
    under-the-table bribes and such.
I give up, I don't have a clue what you're taking about.  Do you?
If so, please elucidate.
Apparently, my comment about *structuring your life* so that you
could ignore the control freaks went right over your head at the
speed of light.
FLAME ALERT:  All Cypherpunks who disdain flamish exchanges
should tune out now.  I'm feeling peevish today and this sort of
mindless drivel pisses me off.  I have decided, therefore, to
amuse myself by fucking with Mr. Choate's head for the remainder
of this post.
    I am afraid [we know that, the question is why you are
    afraid?] that if you ignore a control freak  you build
    the perfect environ [I'm sure you don't mean "environ,"
    a verb.  Perhaps "environment" or "environs" would be more
    suitable.  Sloppy thinking; sloppy language.] for their
    growth. We are  not talking about roses [now you've
    gotten SOMETHING right] here but rather ideas, a
    decidedly different animal.  [Neither roses nor ideas
    are animals, Mr. Choate.  Can you say mixed metaphor?]
    Ideas can grow long after the original thinker is gone.
    [Yes, but what has that got to do with our discussion.
    Focus, Mr. Choate.] To ignore rather than [to?] confront
    and expose [them?] is the best way possible [possible is
    redundundundant, Mr. Choate] to get what you  don't
    want.  [Interesting use of the negative in your sentence
    construction, but you never addressed my thesis, to wit:
    it is possible to structure your life so that you can
    ignore would-be controllers.  There is no substitute for
    critical thinking, Mr. Choate.]

    >>If you are stopped by the police, you are required to

Chris Hibbert responded:
    This is not true.  If you're driving a car you are
    required to have a license.  If you're just walking
    around, you're not required to have a name, or to tell
    it.
Nope, *this* is wrong.  In most jurisdictions, you do not have to
provide *physical ID* if you are not in a car, but you do have to
identify yourself AND give some account as to what you are up to.
    A cop has to have a probable cause to arrest you, and
    not giving your name doesn't provide it.
"obstructing justice" or whatever it's called in the particular
    If you're surly, a cop can take you in, ...
Nonsense.  Where do you non-lawyers get this stuff?  Surly, rude,
impolite, etc. are all protected speech.  (Threatening *ACTS* or
physical resistance, however, is another thing.)
    ... Just say "Officer, someone is waiting for me.  May I
    go now?"
Just say "no"?  I *guarantee* this won't work.  If you are asking
permission ("May I go?"), aren't you ceding to the officer the
legal right to say "no"? If you believe you don't have to
interact with the nice man, why not just turn your back and walk
away without a word?  (I wouldn't advise it.)
    This has been tested in court.  There was a black lawyer
    several years ago who liked to walk a lot.  He lived in
    one of the fashionable neighborhoods in LA, and
    occasionally got picked up because he "looked like he
    didn't belong there".  He sued them and won in court
    every time, and got the police to leave him alone.  [No,
    I don't have references.]
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.  The gentleman in
question was not a lawyer.  He was a black man who was dressed
and coiffured in dreadlocks and Rasta man clothes.  He did not
live in Beverly Hills nor Belaire, but he did like to take long
walks in those neighborhoods in the middle of the night.
He was arrested for not identifying himself with an "official"
ID.  When he sued, the court issued a temporary injunction
against the police for requiring *documentary* identification.
The right of the police to require a person to identify himself
was never in question.  I'm not sure what the disposition of this
particular case was, but that's irrelevant, as it only went to
the issue of documentary ID.  (If memory serves, there was an
interesting result of this case.  The California legislature
attempted to pass, or passed, a law that required to showing of
official identification if demanded by a police officer.  I don't
know how this law ended up, unfortunately.)

You won't believe what a chatterbox I'm going to be today.  This
is just the first of several posts I am planning.  Of course, the
most important must come first.
This week's installment of Acapulco H.E.A.T. was the second part
of a two-episode show called "Code Name: Stalemate."  As you may
recall, from last week, the story, set at a chess tournament in
Venezuela, involved the attempted assassination of an ex-KGB spy
named Andre by H.E.A.T.'s archenemy, Strake.  I should mention
that Andre was a dead ringer for Barry Goldwater (except with a
bad Russian accent.)
This week's episode hardly seemed connected to last week's.
Strake is still holding Krissie hostage, but he seems more intent
now on killing the entire H.E.A.T.  The actor who plays Strake, a
total megalomanic, completely chews the scenery in the worst case
of over-acting I've seen in years.  This, of course, leads to
gratuitous gun play (God, women with guns make me so hot), a boat
chase, an exploding boat and the inevitable climactic fist fight
between the Good Guy and the Bad Guy.  (The Good guy wins.)
During the show we have Strake bugging H.E.A.T. HQ and shutting
it down (again).  Only this time Ashley breaks the "Kasporov
algorithm" and breaks Stake's hold over the H.E.A.T. center AND
infiltrates Strake's system.  Strake also spoofs a phone call so
that H.E.A.T. can't trace it.  The Team uses small tracking
devices to locate kidnapped members (they are discovered).
I got some heat (pun intended) for not mentioning last week's
bikini/Fabio ratio.  When these episodes were make, Fabio was not
part of the Team.  They are all re-runs, so I don't know if he
was part of the original cast and dropped later, or the other way
around.  Anyway, no Fabio.
None of the principles were in bikinis, except for Krissie in the
romantic flashback Marcos had while she was being held hostage by
Strake.  A number of beach background scenes were used, however,
to pump up the bikini quotient.
Finally, we did have a curious exchange between Tony and Cat in
which he explained Zen.  It had something to do with water and
ice, but I guess I wasn't spiritual enough to grok it.
IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT:  My operatives are everywhere.  Even as I
write, one of them is on the trail of Alison Armitage .GIFs!  If
he is successful in bagging them, he will reveal his identity and
make said .GIFs available to interested Cypherpunks.
Stay tuned.

SANDY SANDFORT
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Doug Cutrell offered some well thought out speculations on the
social consequences of "crypto anarchy" in an essay he just
posted to the list.  I would like to respond to a few of his
    ... it is imperative that cypherpunks,... consider
    carefully what social impact these changes may have....
    cypherpunks should examine ways to influence the
    deployment and patterns of use of strong crypto tools in
    society, and not merely consider the construction of the
    tools alone....
With all due respect, I think this has already been done by most
Cypherpunks.  We have looked at societal trends, seen problems,
posited strong crypto as the solution to some of those problems
and examined the consequences of strong crypto solutions.  No one
is writing code just to write code.  The Cypherpunks list has
always been ideologically driven.  Though Cypherpunks cover the
political spectrum, they have put aside sectarian differences to
work towards the narrow ideology of personal privacy.  At the
same time, we have always thought about crypto "side effects."
    ... man is a social animal.  We are evolved to survive
    through cooperative interactions with each other....
    There are universal properties of interaction which
    create the social body in these species, and in all
    human societies throughout history.  These properties
    depend fundamentally on the publicly visible nature of
    most social interactions....
Well, here I must disagree.  While there is no disputing that man
is a social animal, I find the last claim untenable.  There are
numerous historical forms of cooperative interaction that do not
depend--"fundamentally" or otherwise--on a "publicly visible"
interaction (e.g., postal mediated relationships, private clubs
and other private relationships and most aspects of the market).
    Individual social animals exist in a relationship to the
    social body deriving from the visibility of their
    actions to others. This *defines* individuality....
While this is an interesting concept of individuality, it doesn't
jive with any definition I've ever heard.  If you were the only
person on the planet, you would be just as much an "individual"
(perhaps MORE so) than you are with 5.5 billion other folks
blocking your view of the parade.
    ... Strong crypto -- the tools of crypto anarchy --
    represents a break in these primal functions upon which
    the social body is based.... it is not only a first for
    human societies, but a first for all of biological
    evolution.... nodes -- "individuals" --  may appear and
    disappear over extremely short time periods, as
    anonymous identities come and go.  All nodes may have
    any number of unknowable links, or links which are
    unknowable by arbitrarily large sections of the net.
    Links may have new properties, such as asymmetry of
    identity.  Individual nodes may "unknowably" represent
    (equate with) entire collections of other nodes.  The
    point is that the social structure is altered along
    dimensions that have been constant since the dawn of the
    evolution of social animals.
Here is the crux of the matter.  Doug obviously believes that
crypto anarchy represents a paradigm shift or quantum leap in
human interaction.  I don't think so.  every one of the "unique"
properties Doug claimed existed for crypto anarchy already exists
in the non-crypto society.  I won't (unless asked) enumerate such
analogs, but I will give two "clues" as an exercise for the
student:  John Paul Jones and Delaware corporations.
    [1] This picture implies the development of something
    radically different than what we now think of as a
    social body.
    [2] It is far more complex, with new types of basic
    components and operations.
    [3] There is no reason to expect it to resemble any
    society in the history of man, or to bear any
    resemblance to any social body which has evolved to
    date...
[1] Only if the picture is correct, which has not been shown.
[2] Granted, it is more complex, but really "new components" has
yet to be demonstrated.
[3] I most heartily disagree.  Humans are conservative; when they
make progress, it usually looks like an extension of what went
before.  (Ever notice how the first autos looked like buggies?
Why do computer graphic interfaces use "desk" and "folder"
metaphors?)  There is *every* reason to expect crypto anarchy
will resemble historical social models.
    ... For my purposes, desirable changes would include an
    increased standard of living for all humans, increased
    communications ... undesirable changes would include ...
Crypto anarchy is coming whether we like it or not.  With it,
your hopes and fears are much more in your hands then they have
ever been before.  I hope we all use our super powers for good
rather than evil.  In any event, the cat is out of the bag.
    ... it seems that a reasonable approach would be to
    conduct computer simulations of the spontaneous forms of
    self organization that occur in populations
    participating under various game-theoretic and economic
    models, when these populations have access to strong
    crypto....
In my opinion (offered without a shred of proof), (1) it ain't
gonna happen, (2) wouldn't work even if it did happen.
In closing, I want to thank Doug for refocusing discussion of
social implications in such organized and thoughtful way.  I want
to reiterate, this is not something that Cypherpunks have not
thought about and discussed before.  Nevertheless, it is always
good to go over old ground if it can be done in a reasoned and
comprehensive manner.

 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Thanks to Chris Hibbert for the clarification of his (her?)
police stop scenario.  The first impression would have
constituted very bad advice for dealing with your friend, the
    ... you do have to give a name (and probably an address)
    when the police ask.
Of course, it might be added that you have to give a *correct*
name, address and whatever.  In common law countries, such as the
US and UK, this requirement might not be as unequivocal as one
might think.  What name would "John Wayne" (or "Bill Clinton" for
that matter) have to give?  Neither was born with those names.
What if Paul Stubens(?) hadn't volunteered that he was "Pee Wee
Herman" when he got busted for lewd conduct?  Maybe he'd still be
on TV in his Playhouse.
    ... When they do have probable cause, they can insist
    that you cooperate or allow a search.  And if you don't
    cooperate, they can arrest you.
"Probably cause" is not required for a police officers to make
what is called a "field stop."  The criterion for a field stop is
"reasonable suspicion."  During a field stop, an officer can hold
on to you only as long as it takes to determine if there is
probable cause to believe you have committed a crime (this could
include checking to see if you have any wants or warrants).
Incidental to the field stop, the officer is allowed to do a
gross pat-down search of you and anything you are wearing or
carrying.  The purpose of this pat-down is solely to determine if
you have weapons that would endanger the officer.  They can't,
for example, look inside an envelope (which might contain drugs),
because it could not reasonably be expected to conceal a weapon
such as a knife or gun.
    ... If you assume they always have the right to insist,
    you will spend more time talking to cops than you have
    to, and will let them dig deeper than they have a right
    to.  The longer they poke around the better the chances
    they'll find something you thought of as innocent that
    they think is suspicious....
Amen, to that.
    When a cop asks if he can look in the trunk of your car,
    or take a look around your apartment, you can say "I'd
    rather not," and ask if you're free to go.  **Remember
    that they have a gun** and the right to use it in some
    situations.  Be polite.  They'll let you know if they're
    insisting on your cooperation.  Physical resistance is a
    very bad idea.  But there's no need to let them look if
    they don't insist, and they are prohibiting from
    insisting if they don't have a legally justifiable
    reason.

Samuel Kaplin responded to Duncan's assertion that markets have
    The main assumption here is that the populous and the
    markets realize that they are in a totalitarian state.
    We in the U.S. are evolving closer and closer to this
    and most seem not to see it, and if they do, not to care
    about it.
I think this misses Duncan's point.  Neither the populace nor the
market (the economic interactions of the populace) need to
realize they are in a totalitarian state, to take appropriate
action.  What the market does "know" is how to shift capital from
lesser to more remunerative investments.  This is a homeostatic
flow just like water seeking its own level.
    The senario that I see, is
    [1] the borders being closed....
    [2] All of the firearms and weapons being removed from
    private hands....
    [3] The U.S. economy being isolated from the rest of the
    world....  Once your economy is isolated from the rest
    of the worlds who cares what a dollar is worth....
[1] If they stopped foreign businesspeople and tourists, the
economy suffers.  Without Mexican "guest workers" the price of
agricultural products go through the ceiling.  The US can afford
to close its boarders.
[2] I'm a gun nut; I know gun nuts.  If you want to see a civil
war, just try to remove the *200 million* guns from private
hands.  Gun ownership is *growing* not declining.  These folks
are *serious* about keeping their weapons.  Contrary to popular
belief, most cops strongly support the rights of civilians to
keep and bear arms.  Who are you going to get to grab the guns?
[3] The US economy is broad, but not that broad.  Without world
trade (especially for petroleum) we would grind to a halt.  In
the meantime, the billions of people who depend on food grown in
America would not quietly lay down and starve.  The government
can, of course, call a dollar whatever it wants.  The more
unrealistic the assessment, however, the faster black markets
will bloom in the "alternative economy."

Tim May writes with regard to anonymous contract killers:
    ... And the risk of losing the digital cash can be made
    vanishingly small by use of anonymous escrow services,
    which act solely as holders of the digital cash....
I don't buy it.  Anonymous digital assassins, murder escrows and
all that work fine in an artificial, abstract, game-theory world.
I doubt we'll see much--if any--of it in the Real World.  Why?
Because the market is too richly textured not to come up with its
own cultural, ethical and digital fixes.
Would you do business with a escrow that was the bag man for
contract murders?  I wouldn't, you wouldn't and the vast majority
of people in the world wouldn't.  That wouldn't stop some escrows
from performing that service, but it would run up the cost.  When
the costs rise high enough, profitable opportunities are created
for false escrows to enter the business.  That's just one problem
that can interfere with such an odious endeavor; there are more.
I think the best way to illustrate that the anonymous murder
business is nothing more than a bugaboo, is to set the best minds
on the planet--Cypherpunks--to work on the problem.  Let's all
put our thinking caps on, and come up with answers to the follow
hypothetical situation:
Let us assume a world with totally anonymous communications and
payments (strong crypto, remailers, digital cash, etc.).
1)  How would YOU scam money from the system without actually
    knocking anyone off?  Or in the alternative,
2)  How would YOU use technology to address the problem from
    police/private investigator perspective?
I'm betting that with no more than a few moments of thought,
Cypherpunks will come up with a ton of hacks.  To get the ball
rolling, here are two from me:
SCENARIO ONE
I set up a meat-and-potatoes escrow business.  I keep my nose
clean.  I honor my obligations.  I build up a good reputation.
At some point, I'll be approached by a murderer and the person
who is hiring him or her.  I'll accept the payment.  When the
murder is committed, I won't pay off.  The murderer will (a) sue
me (I don't think so), (b) damage my reputation (I'll leave this
one as an exercise for the student), or (c) murder *me* (ah, but
first he has to find me; in the world we posit, that won't be
very easy).  If this scenario happens very often, it'll take all
the profit out of the murder business.  Of course, the murderer
can get the money face-to-face from the customer, but then we're
back to today's square one.
SCENARIO TWO
I set up a phoney murder-for-hire business.  Someone contracts
with me to bump-off their rich uncle.  The client deposits my
payment with a reputable escrow company, "Murder Escrows R Us." I
go to the uncle and tell him the whole deal.  Using digital
technology, bribed coroners, etc., we fake his death.  When the
news hits the Net, the escrow pays me off.  The uncle comes back
to life, disinherits whomever he suspects wanted him dead.  And I
laugh all the way to the digital bank.  I create a new pseudonym,
place another murder-for-hire ad, and do it all again.  Given our
Brave New World, nobody can touch me.
Okay C'punks, it's your turn.  How would you subvert Tim May's
vision of anonymous murder-for-hire for fun and profit?  (Feel
free to take potshots at my two scenarios as well.  Cypherpunk
cleverness cuts both ways, I'm sure.)

    But if the system is set up for total anonymity, _who
    would know_ that an escrow agent was the "bag man"? Just
    like no one would know who the contractee was, or the
    contractor:
The escrow agent is a publicly known entity.  That's how it gets
a reputation.  How do you imagine an escrow agent could get a
reputation for being a murder's bag man if it didn't advertise
as such.  If it advertises as such, I believe most people would
refuse to do any business with it.  If it doesn't advertise, how
will it get those sorts of clients?  There is no reputational
incentive to perform the loathsome service, and plenty of
incentive to (a) just keep the money, or (b) blow the whistle to
the cops and the intended victim (and keep the money).  Please
note, this was all intuitively obvious from my previous post.

Jeff Barber thinks he might have me, but isn't sure enough to
dispense with his dunce cap.  No need to worry Jeff, I am right,
but your reasoning is pretty good, to wit:
    ... It might be possible to construct [the deal] as "I
    authorize you to pay the other party if they can produce
    a certificate that, when decrypted with this key,
    produces this text."  The production of that certificate
    might only be accomplished through the cooperation of
    the on-line coroner...
Clever, but you have already identified your weak point--the
on-line coroner.  More on this later.  About my SCENARIO ONE
(cheating escrow) Jeff offers:
    Why can't I damage your reputation?  Assuming:
    a)there exists a public place to cast aspersions on your
    business
Granted for the sake of argument.
    b)that I have a receipt digitally signed by you
    indicating that you accepted the payment and contract
    from the two parties
Sorry, no can do.  Sounds like being an accessory to a crime to
me.  I wouldn't put anything in writing signed by my known public
key, and neither would anyone else.  What if our True Names ever
became known?  Shit happens, you know.
    c)that I can prove I have "executed" my end of the
    bargain (pun intended)
Here's the rub.  What would constitute proof?  Not just the fact
that the victim was dead--even of foul play.  How do you prove,
in the "public place" given above, that *you* did the dirty deed?
I don't think you can.
    (And surely, you wouldn't try to argue that you didn't
    pay me simply because the contract was for murder -- I
    don't think your potential future clients would relish
    giving their escrow service the power to judge the moral
    virtue of their contracts.)
I don't know.  Some clients would like it, some wouldn't.  The
market would decide.  Don't get too theoretical here.  Remember,
the vast majority of people think murder is a Bad Thing.  I don't
think they would give a rat's ass whether or not a murder got
paid.  This would be *especially* if the escrow passed on some of
the dirty money to them in the form of reduced escrow fees. :-)
    ... in order for this scheme to work, the coroner must
    be in the business of regularly publishing signed and
    certified death certificates on the net....  I'm
    assuming therefore that the life insurance companies and
    the like will exert sufficiently strong influence to
    ensure that your scenario is extremely unlikely....
Oh Jeff, you were doing so fine there for awhile.  The insurance
companies would want to ensure *just the opposite* as long as
they were in on the gag.  I (the fake murderer) would go to the
insurance company as well as the rich uncle.  Why?  Because they
offer rewards for "murderers" who *don't* kill policy holders.
The insurance companies, of course, all work closely with the
on-line coroner to produce false death certificates to screw over
murderers, their clients and/or the escrow companies that do such
business.  Contrary to popular belief, coroners are against
death.  No coroner in his right mind would have any problem
fooling the bad guys.  No electorate, or the private equivalent,
would mind a coroner who lied for a Good Reason like helping to
prevent murders.
    Now how do I get this thing off my head ...)

 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Tim May made some good comments about my post, albeit late
through no fault of his own.  (What is it with Netcom, anyway?
Some of you folks on Netdown ... er ... Netcom ought to look into
CRL.  I've had very little trouble with them, and they are
available in parts of the South Bay.)
Some of his points have raised by others, so I'll focus in on
To which Tim responded:
    I can't follow Sandy's logic here. That I wouldn't use
    such services, that Sandy wouldn't, etc., is hardly
    persuasive. Contract killings happen today, after
    all....
The "etc." Tim left out, is very important.  Most people would be
revolted by an escrow company that facilitated murders.  They
would not do *any* escrow business with such parasites.  This
would mean such companies would have to make *all* their money as
escrows for various illegal/immoral activities.  Statistically,
here just isn't much of market for contract killings; even less
for contract killing escrows.
    Sandy says this "would run up the cost." But from what
    basis? I've made no predictions about the costs, either
    with or without the participation in such markets by
    Sandy or me!
Repeat after me:  The whole world is watching, the whole world is
watching, the whole world...
If the market is tiny and the world otherwise boycotts you, the
only way to make a living offering such a service (crime escrows)
is to charge your clients big bucks.  That's how the costs go up,
irrespective of whether or not Tim and Sandy are in the market.
    What the costs will be is unknown to me, and I don't
    plan to try to forecast the costs. All I claim is that
    anonymous escrow services "solve" the specific problem
    raised earlier about one or more of the parties welshing
    on the contract. A kind of 'clearing' mechanism.
Yes, the solve the problem *if they exist*.  You have merely
posited "anonymous escrow services" as a _fait_accompli_.  In
the real world, there will only be "anonymous escrow services"
for murder, if they make sense economically.  I don't think we
have to worry about such services supported by altruists.
    In any case, there are in fact "escrow agents" today for
    contract murders. Mob families act in this way, putting
    the "full faith and credit" of their organizations
    behind such hits....  The mob families are not
    cryptographically pseudonymous, naturally, but...
True, but is exactly *because* they are not cryptographically
pseudonymous that they usually abide by their ... honor.  They
are flesh and blood people, with known identities, addresses,
families, etc.  Their reputation *does* matter because they are
more vulnerable to physical retaliation than is some disembodied
e-mail address.
Tim wrote several things about SCENARIO ONE (crooked escrow) that
I covered in responses to other people.  One thing not covered
was address by Tim, thusly:
    He then says: "Al's Anonymous Escrow" announced they
    were holding money for this job, as you can see. I did
    the job, as you can see from the digitized images I took
    at the scene, and now Al won't pay up.
Come now Tim, "digitized images"?  Like when I killed that lawyer
in Jurassic Park with my robot T. Rex.  I think the murder will
have to do better than that.
    ...fully pseudonymous agents can still present evidence
    to the court of public opinion and have their
    reputations influenced positively or negatively.
And in the court of public opinion, the pseudonymous agent would
be pilloried for his actions.  As a said in a previous post, no
one will give a rodent's rear for the contract murderer.  Most
folks, including me, would applaud the escrow that didn't pay the
murderer.  I doubt few clients would take their business
elsewhere.  And as before, the escrow could even pass the savings
along to its customers as reduced rates.  Works for me.
    If an escrow agent does this very often, he'll lose all
    his business. Opportunity for an agent who takes his
    reputation more seriously to then gain market share.
Nonsense.  You are thinking like an engineer, not a psychologist
or businessperson.  People would not take their business away
from an escrow who was honorable in every other dealing except
for murder.  The market has no trouble making such ethical/moral
    Just as with Swiss banks ...
Rolled over on Marcos without any discernable loss of business.
    (I'll just make the aside that Sandy's arguments apply
    to bookies the same way...
No it doesn't.  There is nowhere the universality of repugnance
towards gambling as there is towards murder.  It's a numbers
game.  Welch on a bet and lots of people--even those who don't
like gambling--will disapprove and your reputation will suffer.
The number of people who would take their business elsewhere just
because you didn't pay a MURDERER (for god's sake), is
statistically insignificant.
    ... I'm not persuaded by Sandy's arguments that the
    threat of cheaters is sufficient to derail these
    markets. It hasn't derailed them in the real world. It
    won't in the less traceable but even more
    reputation-critical crypto world.
That, again, is because the real world does not have the self
same anonymity Tim thinks will allow for easy contracts for
murder.  Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  Crypto
giveth, and it taketh away.

I'm stymied.  I keep arguing the real world, and everyone
    If the escrow agent has a reputation for reliability,
    honesty, integrity, etc, then the nature of the
    transaction is irrelevant....
I'm sorry, but this is patently ludicrous.  This is not a MUD or
MOO.  We're not talking about game theory and the "iterated
prisoner's dilemma."  This is about the real world.  I could cite
hundreds of examples where folks don't think "the nature of the
transaction is irrelevant."  Tree huggers won't buy from
McDonalds, irrespective of quality, because Mickey D's "encourage
the destruction of the rain forests."  Gun nuts won't do business
with Taco Bell because it's owned by Pepsico, and they've
supported gun control.  There are "green" shoppers and "investors
of conscience."  Hell, Duncan won't even buy the fine chickens
produced by Foster farms because Foster is in bed with the
Klintones (well not literally... well maybe).
The burden of proof is on those who would tell us that human
nature will change over-night when crypto-anarchy comes on line.
People *do* care about the morality of those with whom they do
business.  I see no reason to believe that will change.
Anonymous murder for hire, is not easy.  It isn't going to be any
more a threat under crypto-anarchy than it is now.  Please, let's
get out of this Tabloid, the-sky-will-fall mind set.  It's going

    I'm sorry that you're signing off this thread,
    particularly since it was you that challenged others to
    "disprove" your scenarios.
That was not my main *challenge*.  My shoot-from-the-hip
scenarios were meant to be illustrative.  I wanted Cypherpunks to
use their powers for good, not evil.  My primary challenge was to
think up ways to defeat digital murders for hire.
Why?  Because:
(1)   Cypherpunks support strong crypto and other
      technological means for securing personal privacy.
(2)   We have enemies who are attempting to suppress such
      techniques by inflaming the general public with
      sensationalistic claims (e.g., PGP pedophiles, Net
      narcotraffickers, anonymous assassins).
(3)   To offset these tabloid bugaboos, it is in our best
      interest to solve these "problems" rather than to
      think up new and better ways to create crypto-chaos.
Now everybody can either waste their time thinking up really
neat-o keen-o ways to whack innocent spouses, business enemies
and rich uncles, or you can support strong crypto and privacy by
thinking up ways to mitigate the potentially negative
side-effects of crypto-anarchy.
Don't forget why we tune into the Cypherpunks Channel.  Let's

 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
H.E.A.T. seekers,
Please note my new title for these reviews in the subject line.
Consider it a filtering aid--pro or con.
CODE NAME:  FRAME-UP
The Team is in Culebra ("snake"), Panama to capture a gunrunner,
Salazar, who's supplying terrorists.  They pretend to be hanging
out on the beach (bikini alert) and the grab him as he is making
a "private" cellular call to the terrorists.  During the snatch,
they find that he is carrying cocaine, so that's what he gets
busted for.  He will being going before Judge Diaz, who is not
corrupt, so he's toast unless his brother can rig something.
"Something" comes in the form of Celia Alvarez, a Salazar gun
moll who bears a striking resemblance to our own Romana Machado.
She comes to our hero, Mike, and tells him she wants to make a
break from Salazar's gang.  She gets Mike to her room to talk
about it, and gives him a Mickey Finn.
When Mike comes to, he's in bed with his gun in his hand and a
dead guy (shot with Mike's gun) on the floor.  They dead guy is
judge Diaz.  The cops burst in, Celia says, "he did it" and away
goes Mike.  After this point, the plot self-destructs and makes
no sense at all.  No matter; that's not why we're here.
Before all this happen, however, there is a gratuitous montage of
babes in bikinis, intercut with scenes of our heroes basking on
the beach, practicing martial arts, frolicking in the water,
playing with puppies, etc.  (For those of you who are more
interested in good-looking guys than gals, there were plenty of
shots of shirtless male Team members, posing and flexing their
The upshot of the weird plot twists is that the Team loses its
official backing and has to go in on its own to save Mike.  To do
this, they first break into the DEA's computer.  The purpose of
the intrusion is to put information *into* the database.  They
create files that say that Marcos and Cat are big-time drug
dealers.  With this, they are able to infiltrate Salazar's
operation and ... well I'm not sure what the idea was, but it
gives Marcos a chance to slick back his hair (all bad guys on
Acapulco H.E.A.T. have slicked back hair), and dress in a cheesy
pimp outfit.  Cat gets to put on too much makeup and tart it up
in a short, tight, red dress.
Besides the computer break-in, there is only one other "hi-tech"
plot device.  Outside Salazar's villa, the Team uses a "long
range mike" to pick up Mike's voice inside.  The microphone was
an incredibly cheap-looking hand-held parabolic mike.  It was
only about a foot in diameter, and they were using it *through
the windshield* of their car.  There was also a briefcase with a
flash bomb inside, but that's not particularly hi-tech.
Of course, there is a climactic shoot-em-up, but the only thing
that gets blown up is the aforementioned flash Grenada briefcase.
There was, however, some deliciously irresponsible firearms role
modeling.  When Ashley finds Mike, he's handcuffed.  They have
one of their typical romantic banters that ends with her saying,
"Maybe I should just shoot you and blame it on Salazar."  Mike
responds with a smart-ass comment, at which point Ashley points
her pistol at Mike, causing him to cringe away with his hands
over his head.  She than pulls the trigger and shots through the
links connecting the two wrist sections of Mike's handcuffs.  Ya'
gotta love a woman like that.  (Or else!)

    Sandy's H.E.A.T was hard enough on my poor 'D' key; I
    hope ...  yada, yada, yada ...
While I agree that "Beach Clash" *is* too far afield (sorry,
David), I have a serious and a *seemingly* not-so-serious
reason for "reviewing" Acapulco H.E.A.T.
MY SERIOUS REASON--The world does not see cryptography and
related privacy technologies as do the Cypherpunks.  Most folks
"learn" about crypto from popular culture (e.g., TV and movies)
and, to a lesser extent, the popular press.  When we try to
persuade others to support strong crypto, we have to know what
*they* know (and don't know), if we are to be effective.
MY REAL REASON--Cypherpunks is not just a mailing list.  It is a
wired community of people with strong, commonly held beliefs
concerning privacy.  The problem is, the intensity of our beliefs
and the ultimate seriousness of what's at stake, can lead to a
negative, siege mentality.  I believe there is a place, in every
community of fellow travelers, for humor and humanity.  That's
one of the reasons that physical meeting are so important.  If
you've been to one, you know that it isn't all strategy and
tactics; there is also fellowship.  After a Cypherpunks meeting,
many attendees go out for dinner together.  In California, we
even--god forbid--"bond."  (Not valid in Arizona, Kansas,
Kentucky or where prohibited by law.  Your mileage may differ.
If pain persists, consult a physician.)
Acapulco H.E.A.T., with dubious crypto and suspect technology,
has become an inside joke for Cypherpunks.  When we watch it, we
see things the average person misses.  This is something we
share, and something that helps create the lighter side of
Cypherpunk culture.

H.E.A.T. seeking C'punks,
                      "Code Name: Assassin"
In this episode, we see the return of H.E.A.T. archnememis, Neil
Strake.  (For those who haven't seen Acapulco H.E.A.T., Strake is
played by James Healing who does an extremely bad imitation of
bad (French?) actor, Louis Jordan.)
Anyway, forget the plot, it is even more Byzantine and illogical
than usual.  Suffice it to say that Strake shoots Mike--on Mike's
birthday--in an attempts to kill him.  Mike is in a coma through
most of the show.  The special cartridge has "Happy Birthday"
written on it; the bullet is inscribed, "Mike." (Wow, talk about
a bullet having your name on it.)
This episode was unique in the number of flashbacks and fantasies
it offers:
(1)   Mike goes into cardiac arrest on the operating table.
      Instead of having the currently popular NDE (near
      death experience; dark tunnel, white light, life
      review, etc.), Mike has a fantasy dream of fighting in
      a boxing match.  (He gets knocked out.)
(2)   When the Team fingers Strake, Ashley has a flashback
      to the previous Strake episode, thus practicing the
      parsimony of recycling.
(3)   Later at Mike's bedside, Ashley has another flashback
      about the two of them.  She then sweet talks him in
      his coma and tells him not to die.
(4)   After Ashley talks to him, Mike has another fantasy
      dream boxing match in which he KOs his opponent.
(5)   Finally, Strake goes to a disco for no apparent
      reason.  There he first dances with a beautiful
      quadroon.  He drops her for an Anglo-looking woman.
      During his dance with the Anglo, he fantasized that
      she is Ashley (he has an obsession with Ashley).  The
      dance is meant to be erotic, but it's just silly, even
      when they virtually fornicate on the dance floor.
Here are the crypto/techno elements:
(1)   The cartridge is a ".223 nitro express," which is made
      by only one man, a guy named Sabross.
(2)   Krissie uses the H.E.A.T. computers headquarters to
      "patch" into the surveillance camera system of the
      prison in which Strake is supposedly incarcerated.
      This takes her all of 10 seconds.
(3)   The person in prison is not Strake, but an imposter
      whose appearance has been altered by plastic surgery
      to look, sound and act just like Strake.
(4)   Strake plants a radio controlled bomb at Mike's
      "funeral" (don't ask), which the Team discovers in a
      sweep of the chapel.
There were several good lines in this episode.  In a face-to-face
encounter between Ashley and Strake, he says something about how
he sees the world and Ashley says, "Don't they call that
schizophrenia?"  To which he replies, "Only the people who get
paid to put a name on it, then get paid even more to cure it.
While Strake is putting his bomb together he opines, "I love the
smell of C4 in the morning."
During the funeral, Strake pulls out the radio detonator and
says, "One flick of my finger and you're all taco meat."  (Don't
laugh, have you ever eaten a taco in Mexico?)
There were tons of bikinis in the beech scenes (strangely, there
were only beautiful women on the beach).  The disco people looked
hot, and there was no Fabio!
Tune in next week--same H.E.A.T. channel, same H.E.A.T. time--for
the further adventures of Acapulco H.E.A.T.

be meeting at Linn & Barbara Stanton's apartment on Saturday from
noon till whenever.  The Stanton's live at 315 W. 106th, Apt. 2A
in Manhattan.  This is between West End and Riverside.  The
nearest subway station is on the 1 and 9 lines at 103rd.  If you
need better directions, call them at (212) 316-1958.
We will actually start at noon, so plan to arrive sometime before
that hour.  Everyone should eat first or bring some snacks with
you.  Later, if attendees want, we can have food delivered or go
out for dinner afterwards.
Though I will attempt to hold court, I expect it will be every
bit as anarchistic as the Bay Area meetings.  Anyone wishing to
depose me, is welcome to do so.  If someone has something for the
"agenda," let me know when you RSVP.  Or don't.
If you are sure, kinda sure, or think maybe you will attend
Saturday, please e-mail me at this address.  (If your message
bounces, try ssandfort  Give me your best guess on

    ... there was a variety of smart-bomb developed in WWII
    that used a pigeon as its brain.  The pigeon would be
    trained to peck at a building on a map, and then in the
    falling bomb it would guide the bomb by pecking at a
    clear panel....
I remember seeing a TV documentary that included this technology.
The way it actually worked was that a special steerable bomb had
a camera obscura in its nose.  An image of whatever was below the
falling bomb was rear projected onto a screen made out of frosted
glass.  The screen was somehow rigged so that it could sense
where it was being pecked.  The pigeon was immobilized except for
its head and neck, but it could easily peck any point on the
screen.  They use operant conditioning to train the pigeon to
peck at images of ships at sea.  If the ship was off-center on
the screen, the pigeon's pecking would cause airfoils to correct
the bomb's aim.  Just before the bomb hit, the pigeon would
parachute to safety.  (I made that last part up.)

We had the second monthly meeting of NYC area cypherpunks today.
Eleven of us met at a Chinese restaurant near Times Square (up
from eight, last month).  In addition to good conversation, one
of our number, Sal Denaro, graciously provided Cypherpunkish
"party favors."  Everyone in attendance was given a "Global Key"
pre-paid telephone calling card good for five free minutes of
long-distance calling anywhere in the US.
Sal gave this cautionary advice about privacy.  "If you want
privacy, don't use the phone."  He went on to tell us the sort of
information that phone and calling card companies collect.  So
how do you maximize your calling card privacy?  Sal says you
should to destroy your calling card when you finish with it.
Better yet, memorize the card's ID code and destroy it *before*
you use it.  He has had LEA types bring in cards they had taken
off suspects, and ask for a list of everyone who was called using
that card.  When they had proper legal authorization, he has had
to comply.
Sal wasn't very sanguine about my suggestion of physically mixing
and redistributing cards at C'punk meetings.  He said *he* would
not want to use a card without knowing what it had been used for.
I still think it's not a bad idea, but I see his point.  (Good
afternoon Mr. Sandfort.  I'm Agent Johnson with the Secret
Service and I'd like to ask you a few questions about a call you
apparently made to the White House last month...)
We covered other territory besides phone cards, but mostly it was
an opportunity for local C'punks to get to meet each other in the
flesh.  Duncan will be making an announcement soon about next
months meeting.  I hope to see some new as well as familiar faces

SANDY SANDFORT
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I put together the following proposal to demonstrate a quick and
dirty way to implement a pay-to-play remailer system.  I don't
care much about the details.  Change any of them you feel like.
My main concern is the basic pre-paid postage system concept.  If
those of you who are--or plan to be--remailer operators like it,
it's yours.  No charge. If you don't like it, well, I guess it's
back to the old drawing board.

              THE ELECTRONIC MAIL FORWARDERS GUILD
                           A Proposal
    In this Proposal, I briefly discuss the elements a mail
    forwarders guild might include.  My main purpose,
    however, is to outline a low-tech, anonymous postage
    system that such a guild could deploy today.  My
    proposed system is intended to serve only as a bridge
    until a more sophisticated, digital postage/money system
    is available on the Net.
MISSION STATEMENT--The purpose of the Electronic Mail Forwarders
Guild (EMFG) would be to:
1.  Encourage the proliferation and use of privacy oriented
    electronic mail forwarding sites,
2.  Encourage the adoption of privacy oriented electronic mail
    forwarding standards and protocols,
3.  Create and deploy new products and services on existing
    electronic mail forwarding sites,
4.  To provide mutual aid and assistance with regard to
    technical, legal and other problems,
5.  Establish and maintain an anonymous electronic postage system
    acceptable by all EMFG members.
ANONYMOUS ELECTRONIC POSTAGE SYSTEM
POSTAGE RATES--The first questions the EMFG will have to decide
concern how much the members wished to charge for their services.
Such questions would include:
    Should each forwarding hop cost the same, or should
    first and/or last hops receive a premium?
    Should message lengths be limited?  Should longer
    messages cost more than short ones?  Should each
    kilobyte cost the same, or should each successive
    kilobytes cost less--or more?
    Will the EMFG support any free forwarding?
    What net postage-per-service should EMFG member receive?
POSTAGE "STAMP" NAME--The basic unit of postage should be given a
"brand name."  Using a name instead of an amount, permits bulk
discounts and allows price adjustments as circumstances warrant.
I favor, "Spooner Electronic Postage Unit" or "Spoon-E" for short
(pronounced, "spoonie").  Thus, no matter what a Spoon-E costs,
it would always take one Spoon-E to go through one forwarder or
SPOON-E STRUCTURE--Spoon-Es are random 12-digit numbers
generated by the clients.
POSTAGE ISSUER--The EMFG will need someone to issue Spoon-Es.
The EMFG could elect any of the following options:
    Rotate the uncompensated job among its members,
    Have member bid for the job in exchange for fixed fee or
    a percentage cut of each Spoon-E issued,
    Hire a third-party to issue Spoon-Es in exchange for a
    fixed fee or a cut.
PAYMENT AND ISSUANCE MECHANISM--There are various levels of
anonymity available to clients.  The choice will depend upon the
client's degree of paranoia.  They all, however, are processed
following these steps:
1.  Clients randomly generate a series of 12-digit numbers.
2.  These random numbers, plus an extra random 12-digit ID
    number, are encrypted using the Issuer's public key.
3.  This encrypted message and payment are sent to the Issuer.
4.  After payment has been accepted, the Issuer puts the clients'
    random numbers into an "Outstanding Spoon-E" database, and
    lists the corresponding ID numbers on a "Just Issued
    Spoon-Es" bulletin board.
5.  Clients may access the bulletin board to check when their
    Spoon-Es have been validated for use.
The level of anonymity is determined by the clients' method of
payment and transmission.  Payment via money order is the most
anonymous; personal check, the least.  (Cash is even more
anonymous, but with its own obvious risk.)
The least anonymous method of transmitting the client's 12-digit
numbers is via direct e-mail.  The most anonymous is via an
s-mailed floppy.  E-mail through a forwarder is somewhere in
USE OF POSTAGE--The following steps would be performed in order
to forward messages through a series of EMFG sites:
1.  Clients consult the Issuer bulletin board to verify that
    their Spoon-Es are valid.
2.  Clients write their messages and include the appropriate
    number of Spoon-Es within each nested and encrypted
    "envelope" for each forwarding hop they intend to use.
3.  Upon receipt, each forwarder strips out the Spoon-Es for that
    hop.  The message is added to a mix file of other messages
    until a threshold number is reached.
4.  When the threshold is reached, the forwarder contacts the
    Issuer and verifies the validity of the Spoon-Es.  Valid
    Spoon-Es are removed from the "Outstanding Spoon-E" database
    and the corresponding messages are forwarded out of mix file
    in random order.  The forwarder's account is credited with
    the appropriate payment.  Messages with invalid or missing
    Spoon-Es go to the bit or into the free service channel if
    there is one.
5.  Step "4" is repeated through each forwarder until the message
    is delivered to its ultimate destination.  The various mix
    files help defeat traffic analysis and permit the Spoon-Es to
    be verified before the forwarding service is performed.
The existence of a for-profit (or at least self-funding), privacy
enhanced, electronic mail forwarding system does not need to
await the development of on-line digital money schemes.  It can
be deployed today, using readily available, low-tech methods.
Such a system benefits from economies of scale, and thus argues
in favor of the creation of a group of mail forwarders such as
the EMFG.

Another step that might be taken is to separate the job of Issuer
from that of Database Manager.  In other words, the Issuer would
take in payment and provide a list of valid Spoon-Es to the DB
Manager, who in turn would cancel the Spoon-Es as they were used.
Under the threat posited by Lance, such a step would make it
necessary for the Issuer, the DB Manager and the first remailer
to collude for their to be a problem.
If your paranoia can swallow that much collusion, than the job of

Sting are a lot less likely than plain old scams or poor advice.
When I was in Costa Rica I never met or heard of the folks in

them either.  However, I was not particularly impressed with the
material you posted.  Costa Rica is certainly NOT the best place
to set up a privacy business.  It's too far from where the
offshore action is.  A remarkably high number of con men are
based there, however.  The best places for a sting operation
would be in Caribbean islands, especially noted havens such as
the Cayman Islands.
The Cayman's was where Castle Bank (I think that was the name)
was chartered.  It was a conduit for CIA money laundering and
payoffs.  This all came to light when the IRS(?) used a Miami
prostitute to keep one of the bank officials occupied while the
contents of his briefcase--including confidential client
lists--were examined and photographed.  When the left hand found
out what the right hand had done, the IRS investigation was
dropped and the photos were destroyed lest some CIA asset might
be compromised.  (Gosh, don't we just love those euphemisms.)
Anyway, I doubt that the Costa Rica folks are a sting operation,
but I also doubt they offer much of value either.

Tim says, "your house, your rules" and acknowledges that Eric is

to Eric's first step except in a "slippery slope" sort of way.
Personally, I'm against mandatory digitally signatures as a

like the idea of having the list software automatic verify
digital signatures.  This is a valuable service I'm usually too
lazy to perform for myself.
Here's my suggestion.  Eric should unilaterally impose his first
step, i.e., all unsigned messages and messages with spoofed
signatures will henceforth be flagged as such.  Let's see what
effect, if any, that has on the way people post their messages.
After the protocol has been in effect for some time, we can

Michael Crawford wrote about my article in the December '94 issue
of Wired, ("Watching the Detectives", p. 141):
    ... The advantage for society is that the cop's
    behaviour, such as billy-club swinging velocity, can be
    monitored. It could detect gunfire, too, ...  This would
    work to the extent that the equipment is actually
    mounted on the cop it claims to belong to, so some
    manner of authentication would be needed.
Fleming told me that the localizers would also take biometric
readings to monitor the cop's physical status.  It turns out that
individual biometric readings vary significantly from person to
person.  It would be very hard for one cop (or a dog, suspect,
whatever) to pose as someone else by wearing his localizer.
    ... Yes, that's right - keep surveillance cameras going
    on _yourself_. If you're not doing anything illegal,
    you've got nothing to fear from taping everything you
    do.
I don't like this idea one bit.  I agree with Tim that it is the
first step on a very slippery slope.
    ... I expect that it will be difficult to convince our
    Nation's Finest to adopt this new technology - though
    I'm sure they'd be happy to apply it to parolees and
    those serving on probation....
It would be difficult for the cops to reject it.  After all, it
definitely benefits vast majority of good cops.  It only hurts
that teensy-tiny minority who violate people's rights.  Right?
Michael also argued that it might be more easily sold to private
security firms for legal liability reasons.  This argument is
even more persuasive for police officers.  Cities routinely pay
astronomical settlements, or fight expensive law suits, arising
out of alleged incidents of police misconduct.  Frivolous
lawsuits would be quickly thrown out of court.  Rogue cops would
be identified and thrown off the force.  Works for me.

This misses the point I was trying to make.  The first argument
in favor of wiring the cops, is that it is to their benefit.  It
helps backup officers or medical personnel to find them.  It
protects them from unfounded accusations of brutality or other
misconduct.  It makes a permanent visual and sound recording of
perps who get away.  This helps in later identification.
Even with all these arguments in favor of wiring, I have a
sneaking suspicion the cops will not want it.  Why?  Though few
police would admit it publicly, my conjecture is that they know
they are currently getting away with murder (sometimes literally)
and would feel being wired would force them to obey the law.  So
my "teensy-tiny-minority" argument was offered sarcastically.  In
addition, I think recording officers' shifts would show just how
little work cops actually do for their pay.  Wiring would really
throw a money wrench in the doughnut-boys cushy deal.

Mark Hittinger had several thoughts about real-time surveillance.
    ... The technology to fabricate video evidence is there
    is it not?
Big problem with self-surveillance; not a problem with a properly
set up system of police surveillance.  The critical element is a
trusted third-party agency to archive the tapes.
    There was a relatively recent sad case of two officers
    that had a video camera installed in their patrol
    car.... the occupants of the car murdered the policemen
    and the *entire* scene was obtained on video tape....
    It is possible that they might have been saved had this
    been real-time video rather than taped.
Yes, and real-time video monitoring would be a good upgrade when
the technology allows it (real-time location monitoring is
possible now).  In the meantime, *obvious* video recording would
also help protect officers in that some perps would think twice
before killing someone *on camera*.
    ... Another great idea would be anonymous real-time
    monitoring of vital signs along with position data.
    Auto-911 if you will.  We know somebody at this corner
    had a heart attack 5 minutes ago where is he?
The developers of the localizer technology I mentioned in my
article have anticipated you.  Their equipment can do real-time
vital sign monitoring.  There are some obvious benefits for wired
cops plus some subtle drawbacks for bad cops.  (I leave discovery
of said drawbacks as an exercise for the student.)

Tim May is correct that a "broadcast polygraph" is not planned by
Fleming and Co.  However, they do contemplate at least sampling
vital signs using their technology.
Since my opinion is that polygraphs are almost totally useless
for detecting deception, I think the same would apply in spades
to broadcast vital signs.  In addition, all that is planned for
the localizer is pulse and maybe blood pressure.  That's enough
to see if the officer is in trouble (or engaged in sexual
activity, by the way), but not enough to test his/her veracity.

Bob Snyder's recent post suggested that my argument in favor of
wiring the cops could be use to support wiring of civilians or
employees.  Not so.
Police are public officials.  As such, they have no right to
privacy *with respect to their public acts*.  When off duty, cops
have the same right as other citizens to privacy in their private
lives.  I said my proposal was "anti- *bad* cop" and that it
would benefit good cops.  Do I need to say that it would only
benefit good cops in the line of duty?  It would be bad for
anyone--cops or civilians--in their private lives.
Employees represent an intermediate position.  If an employer is
foolish enough to require that employees be wired, 'sokay with
me.  For most employees in most jobs, it would not be acceptable.
I think they would get jobs with less intrusive employers.  Some
employers will wire some employees, whether or not the police are
wired.  Wiring the cops is a good idea; arguments about wiring
employees and citizens are nothing more than red herrings used to
avoid addressing the real issue of police accountability.

             ANARCHY, CHAOS ON THE INTERNET MUST END
Elections are over, and for better or worse, recognized leadership is
installed and working in most places.  Yet, in Cyberspace the electronic
world dominated by the much-vaunted Internet, there is not much order. This huge international computer web tying together about 30 million
people is governed by no one. What an amazing state of affairs.  The most powerful communications medium
ever invented is being left to the equivalent of mob rule.  Last year was
the year of the Internet in the media.  Clearly it is now mainstream. Nonetheless, judging by what you read or hear, the key question of who
runs it is not even an issue.  It is more fun, after all, to contemplate
shopping in an electronic mall or how to order a pizza through a modem. No matter, if you scratch the surface of this big, happy party, the need
for firm direction is all too obvious.  Also reported in the press is an
expanding array of Internet problems.  Unregulated broadcasting of
sexually explicit material that is readily available to children usually
heads the list, but on-line sexual harassment, profanity, defamation,
forgery and fraud run close seconds. The secretiveness that computer communications allows is a special reason
why abuse is easy.  National and personal security are serious
considerations when anyone can, with complete anonymity, send encrypted
information worldwide via the Internet.  Such problems are further
exacerbated by a computer located in Finland called the Anonymous Server,
which exists for the sole purpose of laundering computer messages, much
like dirty money is laundered through small island nations.  Consequently,
if you want to, say, threaten someone with death, your risk of retribution
is small, courtesy of the Anonymous Server. Nowhere are Cyberspace difficulties more evident than in the inevitable
swing toward Internet commercialization.  The widely reported turf war
rages between academic factions that controlled the Internet before it
went public and business newcomers who now want access to its huge
audience.  Electronic attacks on business people by means ranging from
computer insults, called flames, to assorted forms of electronic
vandalism, persist uncontrolled.  Worst of all are the ``canceller
robots,'' computer programs meant to erase the communications of anyone
the hackers who usually launch them wish to silence. These self-styled vigilantes routinely challenge free speech in Cyberspace
unabated.  Internet access providers, companies that connect people to the
Internet for a profit, likewise assume the role of censors, arbitrarily
closing accounts of those whom they disapprove. Given its international nature, one obvious way to bring much needed order
to the Internet is through diplomacy.  The United States should lead in
this.  A good beginning might be to urge the Finnish government to
deactivate the Anonymous Server.  Diplomacy could also help to establish
an international standard of recognizing laws existing at the point of
origin as controlling the message sender. When conflicts arise, governmental diplomacy should again be the answer,
just as it is with other trade and communications issues.  Next, laws
already regulating behavior in the real world should be applied in
Cyberspace.  This is already taking place on a case-by-case basis, but the
process is too slow.  The Supreme Court should act to crate a precedent
stating that crime is crime, even when the criminal instrument is a
computer keyboard. In the United States, legislation should be passed making Internet access
providers common carriers.  This will get them out of the business of
censorship and under the guiding hand of the Federal Communications
commission. People need safety and order in Cyberspace just as they do in their homes
and on the streets.  The current state of the Internet makes it clear that
anarchy isn't working.  If recognized governments don't find a way to
bring order to the growing and changing Internet, chaos may soon dictate
that the party is over. Martha S. Siegel is the author of ``How to Make a Fortune on the
Information Superhighway'' and CEO of Cybersell in Scottsdale, Ariz.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, sort of.  My understanding is that the US dollar is still
backed by gold on some theoretical bases.  Nixon just closed the
``gold window.''  That is, foreigners are no longer allowed to
get gold for greenbacks as was the case up until then.  Of course,
plain old Americans haven't been allowed to do that for the last
60 years or so.
As for FRNs, they are ultimately backed by a promise to pay in

There's another angle I may have mentioned before.  Many electronic phones come with a ``feature'' that allows you to call home, produce an electronic tone and eavesdrop on your own
house.  When the tone is sounded, the ringing stops (or never
starts) and the phone goes into ``off hook'' mode (i.e., the
microphone in the mouthpiece is turned on).
Even if you did not buy this feature when you bought your phone,
it is still there, just waiting for that electronic tone.  You can't produce it, because you didn't buy the doohickey, but anyone
with such a doohickey can call your house and listen in. . .

Recently, several folks on this list have posted `letters to the

Not so much a model as an exact map of earth's gravity field.
Twenty years ago, I was friends with a scientist who had worked
for the US government some years before that.  He sailed around
the North Atlantic in a ship that contained extremely sensitive
gravity measuring devices.  He was mapping masscons on the ocean
floor so that their effect on intercontinental ballistic missiles
could be taken into account when targetting the missiles.
The equipment was sensitive enough to measure the gravity
gradient between sea level and altitude of a meter or two.  Since
the ship on which he sailed regularly experienced swells of that
magnitude or greater, other equipment was used to measure the
swells and to mathematically cancel out their effect.  Cool.
I can see why the folks at Ft. Meade would be hinkie about such
measurements being made around them.  No need to hypothisize
micro-singularities or anti-gravity experiments.  Occam's Razor
in action.

Of course, it's interesting to hear how and why this agency
decided it needed an airforce to pursue its mission, but the real
story for me was how SOF busted them.
SOF had heard rumors about a covert operation on the part of the
BATF to procure these aircraft.  They did their own surveillence

diving.  What they came up with was unbelievable.  It included
agents home addresses, the names of family members, official BATF

Here is a press release that Netscape has issued (is about to issue?) concerning their recent miscue.
 S a n d y
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Potential Vulnerability in Netscape Products - Netscape Responding
Immediately To Upgrade Customers and Minimize Risk of Future Threats
During regular monitoring of Internet security newsgroups, Netscape has
discovered a potential vulnerability in the current version of the Netscape
Navigator. Late Sunday evening two UC-Berkeley students posted a message to
the Internet detailing their efforts to reverse engineer some security
capabilities of the Netscape Navigator. Their efforts revealed how the
program generates session encryption keys, enabling them to replicate these
keys with a moderate amount of computing power and decipher messages sent
across the Internet. The potential vulnerability has since been confirmed by
Netscape engineers. With this knowledge an experienced computer programmer
could decrypt messages sent by Netscape Navigator to other computers in a
few hours of computation time.
Netscape secure software has been in use for almost a year on the Internet
by millions of customers and no thefts of actual customer information
protected by our security have been reported. This posting on the Internet
reported a potential vulnerability, not the actual theft of customer
information. Netscape plans to address this vulnerability
quickly by providing updated software as soon as possible via
the Internet. An updated version of Netscape Navigator 1.1 and 1.2 will be
available for downloading on the Internet next week by existing customers.
In addition, Netscape Navigator 2.0, which was announced yesterday and will
be available next week in beta versions, includes this imporvement as well
as a number of additional security features.
Detailed Issue:
Current versions of Netscape Navigator use  random
information to generate session encryption keys of either
40-bits or 128-bits in length. The random information is found
through a variety of functions that look into a user's machine
for information about how many processes are running, process
ID numbers, the current time in microseconds, etc. The current
vulnerability exists because the size of random input is less
than the size of the subsequent keys. This means that instead
of searching through all the 2^128 possible keys by brute
force, a potential intruder only has to search through a significantly smaller
key space by brute force. This is substantially easier problem to solve
because it takes much less compute time and means
40-bit or 128-bit key strength is substantially reduced.
Netscape is already implementing a fix to the specific portion of our
software where this vulnerability exists. We plan to address
the problem by significantly increasing the amount of random information
that cannot be
discovered by external sources from approximately 30-bits to approximately
300-bits. In addition, the random information will be made much more
difficult to replicate because we will greatly expand the techniques and
sources used to generate the random information. Once this improvement is
made, protection of the random information will be as strong as the rest of
the security built into
Netscape has also begun to engage an external group of world class security
experts who will review our solution to this problem before it is sent to
customers. These experts will validate Netscape's solution and insure that
it is complete and effective in solving this vulnerability. The group will
be used on an ongoing basis to work with Netscape's internal security
experts to review the design and implementation of security in Netscape's
products and to provide an additional measure of assurance that these
products implement the highest levels of security possible.
This discovery does not affect the strength or security
of  SSL, RC4, or any other portions of our security
implementations. The fix will restore Netscape security across all products to
the true 40-bit level for Export and true 128-bit level for U.S.
Customers intended before this discovery. Current versions of Netscape
Navigator should be replaced with updated
versions that will be made available next week. In addition, the
current version of the Netscape Commerce Server has a similar vulnerability
during it's initial key-pair generation. Therefore, a patch will be made
available from Netscape and should be applied by Commerce Server customers
to generate a new key pair and server certificate.
Updating Customers:
Netscape will provide the fix for Export (40 bit) versions of Netscape
Navigator later this week for downloading by customers on the Internet.
Similarly, the
Commerce Server patch for Export versions (40 bit) will be made available
from our home page. Because downloading of 128 bit versions of the software
is still not permitted by U.S. law, U.S. customers of Netscape Navigator,
Netscape Navigator Personal Edition and Netscape Commerce Server using 128
bit versions can request the replacement from Netscape for delivery through
the regular mail.
For additional information or replacements for 128-bit versions of software
that you have already purchased, please call the Netscape Replacement Desk
at 415-528-3600, email replace or contact your existing
Netscape representative
directly. We will inform you immediately when the updated software is
available for download.

certainly not all, list members would agree with everything I believe about privacy, encryption, freedom and the government.
I know I don't believe in a lot of the stuff I read here.  Why
would any of us want a spokesman other than themselves?  So I
ask, "useful" to whom?
Second, the reason a spokesman cannot be appointed is not due
to lack of [an?] organization, but rather the lack of any
unifying creedo or statement of belief.  Had the list founders
said, "Cypherpunks is a list for people who believe X, Y and
Z.  Sign-up if you are one of us."  Then we might have an
"official" viewpoint which a spokesperson could help
articulate.  They didn't, we don't and, frankly, that's the
way I like it.
You want to express your views to the press?  Knock yourself
out.  You want to call yourself a "Cypherpunk"?  No one will
stop you.  You want to characterize what other Cypherpunks
say and believe?  You might say something I disagree with,
but again, no one will stop you.  (Of course, they may counter
your free speech with some free speech of their own, but that's
the name of the game.)
Yours in anarchy,

There is an article in this week's issue of THE EUROPEAN about
cigarette smuggling in Europe.  There is some regulatory
arbitrage from south to north because of disparities in the
local taxes on tobacco, but the big "problem" is American
cigarettes.  Since even in the lowest tax European countries
taxes make up 70% of the retail price of cigarettes, there is
huge incentive to smuggle in US smokes.  Makes me proud to be
an American.

 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Something of privacy interest happened to me yesterday.  I phoned
a company to ask for a copy of their catalog.  The phone clerk
asked for my last name and zip code.  After receiving that info,
the clerk asked me, "Is this your full name and address?" and
then gave them both correctly.  I was taken aback.
I have been at my new address for only a couple of months.  Prior
to that, I have been couch surfing for a year and a half.  Though
I called an 800 number, ANI had nothing to do with it since I was
calling from work.  It may have been from a database associated
with a credit reporting agency, a bank or a utility company, but
I am not aware of any of these being available on-line for something as mundane as requesting a consumer catalog.  The clerk had no idea where the info came from (or so he said).  Does anyone know how this trick was done?

easy it was to buy *phone numbers* on CD-ROMs.  Great, but I
didn't give the guy my phone number.
Fine, but I haven't put in any changes of address with the PO.
Yeah, maybe, but my original question was, "does anyone KNOW how the trick was done?                                     ^^^^

2) I was not griping.  I was requesting information (of which
   "Anonymous" is apparently bereft).
3) Being "taken aback" refers to surprise (look it up).  Far

There has been sporadic interest on this list with regard to
offshore incorporation, banking, etc.  While ads for offshore
services are common in the international press, until now, none
of these companies has an Internet presence.  THE ECONOMIST has an ad for OCRA, a group that specializes in
offshore company services.  What's new is that they have a Web
page.  It includes a good primer on the benifits from going offshore and on selected offshore jurisdictions.  I've never done

He was not the only one.
Due to the vicissitudes of the C'punks' list, my correction
arrived before my post for some people.  the URL is:
As Tim correctly pointed out, the Net has carried information on
offshore banking and related topics for some time.  My point was
that--as far as I can tell--OCRA is the first major one-stop
supplier of offshore incorporation, trust and banking services
to open a Web site.
More important, though, is the content of their site.  Whether
or not one does business with them, their site offers a very
good primer on the whys and wherefors of going offshore.

No relevance here.  Originally enacted to combat the "white slavery" trade, it was probably used more to prosecute unmarried
lovers for sexual activity outside of marriage.  I don't even

I have a tiny correction to Bill's assumption and that of a few
others who have commented on "white slavery."  The laws in question were concerned with prostitution, not kidnapping or rape.  The term "white slavery" arose because the social fiction
was that these women could not possibly have been prostitutes by
choice, they must have been forced into it by others.  A current
variation of this thinking is promoted by some anti porn
"feminists" with regard to women in the adult movie industry.

I haven't followed this thread since the initial posting of
the Declaration, but this particular piece of shallow thinking
jumped out of the computer at me.
On sum, the people on the Net are the brightest, most sophisticated segment of our society.  Politicians, by contrast, are--on sum--the most venal of humans.  To liken
them to "parents" and the rest of us to teenage ingrates is
truly insulting.  An apology is in order from Mr. Cook.
Even assuming agruendo that the analogy applies, then the Declaration is still on the right track.  It's time to grow
up, leave our parents' house and move beyond their smothering
"care."  Grow up Tim Cook.  You've parked your feet under Mom
and Dad's table too long.  It's time to deal with your peers
and the rest of the world on your own, two, independent feet.

No one has ever made an announcement on the Cypherpunks list such
as the one you "paraphrased."  The meetings have always been open
to everyone.
If the good doctor is referring to my univiting of Jim Bell to
a private party held AFTER a Cypherpunk meeting he had better get his facts straight.  Jim Bell would have been welcome at the
Cypherpunks meeting.  He would not have been welcome at my party,
though, because of his intemperate bad manners, NOT his politics.

 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I have to admit I haven't read the Leahy bill in detail.  But
I do get a little hinky whenever Congress tries to "help" us, so it seems reasonable to look for the worm in every legislative apple--the Leahy bill included.
Having said that, I am totally put off by the gradiose and devisive ravings of this commentator.  During the Second World War the Nazis required Jews in the occupied countries to wear a
yellow star of David to identify themselves.  In Denmark, the
king so identified himself, and soon so did most of his subjects. In that grand tradition of solidarity with persecuted minorities I request that I be added to anonymous' "LIST OF SHAME."  It is MY protest against this utter nonsense.  (I have always felt cheated that I was too young and politically naive to make the Nixon Enemies List.  I've made it up some since then with a fat FBI file, but it just isn't the same.)
A CYPHERPUNK CALL TO ARMS!!!
(Did I get the style right?)  C'punks, if you feels as I do, please take a few moments to sign up for the LIST OF SHAME?  Let's show Bill, Bruce, Matt and all the others what most Cypherpunks really think about them and Mr/Ms Anonymous.

SUPPORTERS OF MR/MS ANONYMOUS
Supporters of the Leahy Bill are, to me, well-intentioned dupes.
I've lurked on this list under this and a previous usename since the list was a couple months old. I came here to learn crypto, not debate politics. And, while the urge has often been all but overwhelming, I've for most part kept my silence, prefering back channels to posting on the list.
The Politics of the Absurd has in the last year or three found me in agreement with figures on the national scene whose pockets I would
decline to piss were their balls on fire. Nor am I quite comfy siding
with anonymous in regard to the Leahy Bill, but...
I neither like nor trust the bill and, after the Digital Telephony Bill and its manner of passage, my trust in the good senator is zero.
I am still a little puzzled why there was so little discussion on the list of what Freeh might have told the congresscritters that long summer when he seems to have visited them all. Sort of makes this leftie wonder if, just maybe, the rightwing conspiracy boys who claim the unusual number of congressional dropouts was the result of FINCIN findings might not have stumbled upon a quarter-grain of truth.
While I applaud the efforts of those working for the cause in the political sphere, I have scant faith. Business will be on the side of privacy until it gets what it wants, then walk away from individual concerns for privacy, etc.
I've always enjoyed your posts and sense of humor. Apologies for going on at length.

To which Black Unicorn responded: Though I think the wager offered way out of line, I wish that this mechanism for handling disputes were used more often on the
Cypherpunk list.  It's easy for folks to shoot their mouths off when they can do so at virtually zero cost.  The results are endless flame wars with only rare resolution.  When money is at stake, there is an incentive to be more temperant in ones claims.
I would be interested to see if Jim Bell and Black Unicorn could
engage in a "friendly" wager on the question in point for the
nominal sum of, say, US$100.  Perhaps they can cooperate to frame
their dispute in unambiguous terms, mutually agree upon an escrow
agent and pick a referee or other resolution mechanism to decide their "case."  Wouldn't that be something?
By the way, gentlemen, I'm not kidding.  Everyone on this list
could use a respite from all the "yes-it-is-no-it's-not" posts
among various combatants engaged in "how-many-angels..." spats.

And you like endless cross-talking better?  In any event, the

As much as I like the Extropians, personally, they haven't
got a clue how to implement practical social systems.  It
is trivial to set up a wagering system that works--and you
don't need all the "polycentric" blah blah.
a)  I proposed that a bet of $100 which Jim Bell ignored.
    That should have made you sit up and take notice.
b)  Unicorn has the 50Gs and I'm confident he would have     paid up if necessary.
This is a non-sequitor.  Anyone serious about winning
WOULD make such a bet.  Do you really think that a legal
scholar as good as Unicorn would just shoot from the hip
without knowing he had it in the bag?

Income tax is the Godzilla of taxes.  It is THE TAX when it comes
to the US.  (Perhaps VAT has a similar status elsewhere, but both,
as pointed out, are subject to crypto-anarchistic subversion.)
But at nowhere near the voracious levels of modern states.
For the same reasons they were dropped in the past.  They have
only a limited ability to extract tribute from a defenseless
populace.  Today's citizens have far more power vis-a-vis the
state, and far less deference for authority.
HEAD TAX--This "regressive" tax would really piss off those on
the lower end of the economic ladder if the price-per-head were
anywhere near what is needed maintain a government.  The amount
of social control needed to make sure most people had complied
would be beyond anything a modern state could field.
LAND TAX--Might be better than a head tax, but the unintended
affects would still piss off the poor.  It would give the relatively few land owners enormous motivation to buy off assessors and, ultimately, higher government officials.  To
the extent land taxes could be collected, they would be enormously economically destructive.  The net effect would be
similar to Soviet collectivisation.  The land, the productive
base of a nation's economic health would be constantly eroded
until everyone was impoverished.
TRAVEL TOLLS--Yeah, right.  The Soviets required VISAS, to travel between cities, yet they couldn't even stop students from taking unauthorized jaunts.
The MODERN state is doomed and, thanks to technology, the people have too much power to permit more "traditional" governments to
control them.  States may not go quietly into that gentle night,
their death throes may be very bloody, but go they will.

[He/She then goes on to write a very well thought out analysis of the ramifications of crypto-anarchy.]
It used to be that only the rich owned cars, went on cruises or
flew in airplanes.  Now almost every person of moderate or even
modest means can do all three.  The same tread can also be seen
in the use of offshore techniques.
A couple of generations ago, only multinationals and the super
rich could avail themselves of offshore banks, asset protection
trust, foreign incorporation, etc.  Fifteen years ago, I was helping members of the upper middle class do the same think.
Today, virtually anyone on this list can afford these techniques.
Non-US people have been using them for years.  The reason middle
class Americans aren't savvy that yet are ignorance and inertia.  Everyday, Americans are becoming less parochial (due in part,
ironically, to government hysteria about money laundering) about
such possibilities.  As the Clintons and Doles turn up the tax
and regulatory heat, they will also overcome their inertia.  Another irony in America is that the lower class seems to be
way ahead of the middle class in keeping more of what they earn.

1)  Read as wide a variety of the stuff out there you can     (even the books by "dangerous crackpots").  2)  Take a vacation to a tax haven you like because of what
    you've read about it.
3)  Open a bank account with an established bank.
4)  Ask your banker to recommend a trustworthy lawyer.
5)  Tell the lawyer what you want to accomplish and do
    what he or she says, if it makes sense to you.
6)  DON'T talk to anyone else--especially in your home
    country--about what you have done, are doing or
    are planning to do.
7)  As your resources increase, repeat steps 2-5 in     other tax havens.  Don't put all your eggs in one
    basket if you have enough to spread around.
8)  Send me $1000.  If you follow my steps 1-7, you will
    save many times that amount.

Actually, no.  When I used to edit a magazine, I commissioned an
article about how much "tax" slaves, serfs, etc. paid.  That is,
how much of what they produced, did they get to keep; how much
went to their masters.  The surprising, cross-cultural answer my
researcher/writer found was that they got to keep everthing they
produced except 5-10%.  That's a lot better, percentage-wise,
than for modern "tax slaves."

Not true.  While they may not be able to use offshore techniques
for their wage-slave jobs (though even that isn't always so), such techniques can be used to put money beyond the reach of their governments, to invest after-tax dollars and to engage in
economic activities which might run afoul of home country laws

Not being technically oriented, I may be venturing into deep
water here, but I don't think ANI "pass through" is likely at
all.  When you use a pre-paid calling card, TWO separate calls
and call set-ups are made, your call to the card company and
the card companies call to your ultimate destination.  While many (most?) card companies keep records of all calls placed,
there are some who keep no records at all.  Unless this
hypothetical "pass through" capability is somehow built into the the phone infrastructure and is transparent to the card companies, I seriously doubt the card companes would invest any
resources in doing such a "pass through."  After all, the same
information is available, albeit with a bit more work, from their operational logs if they even keep those.

I got up to (guess what) go to the bathroom.  On my way back

Neil's cat.  It reached out from under a table and scratched my

was asleep again, so I went to Neil's room to ask him to put the
cat someplace.  Neil, wearing nothing but his shorts and a BIG
.44 automag came out to see what I wanted.  I told him and he
put the cat in the basement.  I thanked him and said the gun
wasn't necessary as I didn't want him to shoot the cat.  His

Works for me.  Throughout most of the history of the US, children
have routinely been intrusted with deadly weapons--rifles, pistols
and shotguns.  I got my first real gun when I was seven or eight.
(Before that, I had a BB gun as long as I can remember.)  I gave my daugher one when she was nine or ten.  I know of one FOUR YEAR OLD whose parents gave her a gun.  (I have no doubt she would use it far more judiciously than your average cop.)  For two hundred years Americans have been able to buy small
guns made especially for children.  I've seen them and they
were beautiful little guns.  Nowadays, the gun manufacturers
has eschewed them--probably for PR reasons.
Hell no!  Let them or their parents buy them.
Ditto, bro.  And guns are great fun.  That's why Thomas Jefferson
opined that giving a young man a gun would do far more to build
his character then engaging in sports.  (I agree.)  Next time you
are in the San Francisco Bay Area, let me know and I'll take you
shooting.  Looks like you need some character building.  :-)
Again, history shows you to be wrong.  Gun control started in
the antibellum South as a means to disarm the newly freed blacks.
When the Black Muslims bought a Southern plantation in the '60s
they were harassed--until they armed themselves with AR-15s. After that, no more problems.  Finally, I know a lawyer who was
a Freedom Rider in the '60s.  Whenever they were confronted with
threats of force, they shot back.  Presto, off into the woods
shrank the cowardly Klansmen.  Other--unarmed--civil rights
workers ended up being encorporated into dams and land fills.
Me too.  That's what we gun owners are fighting to preserve.
Unfortunately, the first you might know of it is when he comes
across a gun and ends up shooting himself or someone else because of the gun ignorance to which you have condemned him.  Good luck.

So have I, but your assertion begs the question.  In an unarmed
society, people don't have to curb their impulse to the extent
they do in an armed one.  As a result they often don't.  The
Swiss and the Israelis seem to avoid internecine fratricide, even
though guns are everywhere.  I don't think it is any coincidence
that incivility and casual violence have increased in America in
direct proportion to the ongoing orgy of victim disarmament.
I've noticed that most civil and human interactions occur in gun
stores and rifle ranges.  I've been treated shabbily in health
food stores, but never at a gun show.  When was the last time
you heard of someone being killed at the shooting range or in a
gun store?  It's statistically infinitesimal.  Now ask yourself
the same question about liquor and convenience stores...
Powerlessness is far more a cause of impulsive rages than the
trust, responsibility and empowerment engendered by gun ownership.

Igor answered his own question with regard to trying to tax  digital money transactions at the bank level:
He then suggested:
Under a totally anonymous digital money scheme, directly tracking income becomes effectively impossible.  One solution that is used
in countries with historically low rates of tax compliance (e.g., France) is to base taxation on apparent wealth.  Not very efficient.  Commodity taxes--especially taxes on only one or a few commodities--create market distortions as people seek to minimize their tax load by commodity substitution (e.g., natural gas or
ethenol for oil) or the use of black market sources (e.g., bootleg cigarettes.)
Poll taxes are universally hated and trivially avoided.  Their
evil twin, head taxes, are likewise hated and only enforceable
with mandatory universal identification.  (In two months, the
Mafia will be selling perfect forgeries supplied by the ChiComs.)
If I were the government, I'd tax realty as my primary or only
source of income.  It *appears* "progressive" so it appeals to
the lower class, but it is passed along to everyone in the form
of higher commodity prices and rents.  Realty can't be picked up and moved to another jurisdiction like personal property or
people, so it is easier to hold as a tax hostage by government.

I think Bill needs to re-examine this statement.  If the ONLY source of taxes was realty, the only limit to the amount it can
be taxes is the asset base of the country's population.  Taxes
on land can be arbitrarily high just as long as the land owner
can pass his costs on to tenants and customers.  If my rent went
up five times and everything I bought increased in price ten
fold but I paid no direct taxes, would I be any worse (or better)
off?  The purpose of taxes is to fund government.  As long as
everyone thinks the suffering is pretty much evenly spread, there
are few complaints--at least until it becomes impossible to live
on what's left.
Please understand, I not for ANY taxes.  As I said to someone in
private e-mail, if it were up to me, I'd fund the last days of

people make the transition and would dispose of "public" assets
in a more or less orderly fashion.  (How much am I bid for this

aonymous payment system could not be useful in preserving privacy.
One could purchase several of these cards--preferably in the smallest denominations consistent with their mission.  Each card
could be used so that its audit trail left whatever impression
one wished to leave.
Of course, if you are arrested with one or more of them on you,
they could be used to tie you to times, places and activities
with which you might not wish to be associated.  Proper handling
could obviate or reduce this risk however.
It's not as anonymous as cash, but it might draw a lot less

of a named individual.  At least where the retail establishment
has an on-line credit card terminal, the risks and protections
should be equivalent to a regular debit card. I'd bet dollars to donuts that the VISA Travel Money cards will
be usable just like VISA credit and debit cards within the next

A.  Where does Jim get the terms of the contract he implies from

B.  I'm unaware that the Cypherpunks list has ever been advertised

C.  Combining A & B, I know of know instance where the owners of
    the Cypherpunks list ever made any indication that they were
    adhearing to the Byzantine interpretation of contract law as
    suggested by Jim.  (It sure doesn't comport to what I learned

possible exception of Texas, I guess).

Gladly. Prices rise over time because of inflation of the money supply.  While it is possible for private actors to temporarily
inflate the money supply (e.g., extension of credit by banks),
only the government can increase the money supply indefinitely.  Inflation is the most insidious form of "taxation."  It steals
silently and punishes the savings in favor of consumption.
Technically, Jim's logical fallacy is called /post hoc, ergo propter hoc/, after this, therefore on account of this.
Nope, that's not what I said.  This fallacy is called a "straw

Wrong.  Most, if not all of them have.
In other words, Jim thinks his legal opinion is just as good as
anyone else's.  A nice eqalitarian sentiment, but obviously
unfounded.  There is such a thing as an educated opinion, as
there are also pig ignorant opinions.
Jim thinks a dictionary definition of "private" are terms of a
contract.  Interesting.
But, Jude was not and is not an owner of the Cypherpunks list.
Whatever she wrote (and I don't have that issue before me) in
no way binds the owner even if there were some validity to Jim's
fanciful claims about the legal requirements on "public" lists.
That and US$1.25 will get you coffee at the Top of the Mark.
Jim apparently thinks a person can be bound by the opinions expressed in a "public" forum by a third party.  Okay, in this
public forum I publically state that people (such as Jim) who post really dumb, psuedo-legalistic posts have to pay each list
member a buck for spamming.
What actions?
Mock legalese in no way alleviates Jim from the consequences
of making uneducated legal pronouncements in front of God and
Whose interpretation is it then.  Is Jim disavowing his own
Maybe because the issues of "public" (which Jim tells us, below,
is" a public place is someplace which is operated using public monies") lists do not require resorting to any "special nature" of computer networks and can simply be addressed by pre-existing legal princples covering run-of-the-mill membership organizations.
Jim does not seem to understand that the Public Accomidation Act is applied PRIMARILY to private property.  It is his loony-toon
sea-lawyer concepts of "public," as in public list, that are the
cause of his total misunderstanding of the legal issues here.
First, where is Jim's citation with regard to the definition of
a public place?  I'd like to see him support just one of his
outrages legal claims with at least a scintilla of evidence.
Second, what legal evidence does Jim have that the sender of a
stream of characters (i.e., the provider of a service--free in
this case) is under any obligation to continue to provide a forum
for people he no longer wishes to provide said forum?  This is the crux of the issue.  Jim can get into all the side
issues he wants about gun laws and whether his dog should vote.
The question before us is, may those who run the Cypherpunks list
have the right arbitrarily throw someone off the list, even though
it be advertised as "public"?  Clearly people have been thrown off
such public lists (including, I believe, Cypherpunks).  Nothing
happened.  If Jim believes the outcome should have been otherwise,
he has the burden of proof of explaining why.  He may, of course,
again offer his odd legal opinions, uncontaminated by actual
legal knowledge, but actual recourse to the law would be a lot
more convincing.
Of course, if Jim actually comes up with something better than
his opinions, I'll be ready to address such arguments.
Cool.  Please have them post something on this thread.  I'd love

Simple.  In a market economy, with or without inflation, relative
prices are constantly changing in response to changes in supply and demand, and as capital is moved among investments to maximize
return.  In an inflationary environment the result is that while
all (or at least most) prices are rising, some will rise faster
than others in the short term.  Q.E.D.
Only to someone who does not understand economics.  A counter
example is the unregulated computer industry.  Prices rise very
little, if at all, and even undergo price deflation at times. Sorry, this is incorrect.  (We call that an analogy.)  The definition of "straw man" I used came directly from the dictionary.  Now you may have a "personal" definition, but I
doubt it's widely shared.  (Ref., my Lewis Carrol quote in my

I have heard, but have not evidence for, is that with use, these

Using cross-sectional time-series data for U.S. counties
from 1977 to 1992, we find that allowing citizens to carry
concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it appears to
produce no increase in accidental deaths. If those states
which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions
had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177
rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been
avoided yearly. On the other hand, consistent with the
notion of criminals responding to incentives, we find
criminals substituting into property crimes involving
stealth and where the probabilities of contact between the
criminal and the victim are minimal. The largest population
counties where the deterrence effect on violent crimes is
greatest are where the substitution effect into property
crimes is highest. Concealed handguns also have their
greatest deterrent effect in the highest crime counties.
Higher arrest and conviction rates consistently and
dramatically reduce the crime rate. Consistent with other
recent work (Lott, 1992b), the results imply that increasing
the arrest rate, independent of the probability of eventual
conviction, imposes a significant penalty on criminals. The
estimated annual gain from allowing concealed handguns is at
least $6.214 billion.

The fallacy in this argument is the assumption that because some
American capital moves overseas, there will be less capital available in the US for investment/wages.  It doesn't contemplate
infusion of foreign capital investments in American industries that have a competitive advantage over their foreign competition.

Been there, done that.  I repeat, the error that Bart made is
assuming that because some US-source capital gets redirected overseas, that the total amound of capital investment will decline thus producing the wage drop he is fretting about.
Unless he can show that foreign capital investment will not flow
to US workers who are "forced" into working in industries where
they have a comparative advantage, his argument must fail.  After
all, I--like the economists Bart cite--think international free
trade, the free flow of capital in persuit of the highest return
and division of labor are a GOOD thing.

The movement of capital from the US was an *assumption* in Bart's
argument.  He has done nothing to show that it would in fact
happen.  When he proves that, they it would be reasonable to
expect me to offer proof that foreign capital will flow to the US.
It seems just as likely to me that US source capital will NOT flow overseas if it can be profitably invested in other US
industries that retain--or gain--competitive advantage from relative changes in productivity, supply and demand, or whatever.
In my experience, Americans are loathe to invest money overseas
unless it is highly profitable.  The reason is obvious.  They
understand--or think they understand--the rules here.  In historical terms, US investments have been more stable and safer
than investments overseas.  (Which is why, by the way, that the
US is the worlds largest tax haven in the world, but I digress.)
Thus, until Bart can support his highly dubious assertion that
capital that flows away from some non-competitive US industries
will necessarily flow offshore, there is no need for me to prove
that such a situation will probably lead to a counterbalancing
foreign capital flow into the US.  So far, Bart has not yet met
his burden of proof.
While I'm sure per capita capital investment is a *factor* in determining how high wages are, it certainly is not the only
factor.  It appears that Bart has fixated on this one to the
exclusion of other (probably more important) factors.
It is just this sort of unnecessary condescending snottiness that
create the clear impression that Bart is an asshole.  Perhaps he
is a fine chap and this is just his style, but I find it very
offensive an counter-productive in this discussion.

I've just had an insight with regard to Bart's ongoing capital Bart's error lies in his confusion of the terms "captial" and
"capital investment."  While capital may be used to make capital
investments, there are other things it can be spent for as well
(wages, taxes, supplies, etc.).  If Bart were to use the term "infrastructure" then it would be
clear that the ebb and flow of mere capital would have relatively
little to do with infrastructure influenced wages.   S a n d y

Some right-wingers don't like free speech, most do.  This characterization is not enlightening on the question at hand.
Does Buchanan favor censorship of the Net?  If so, what leads you
to believe Schlafly shares that particular view?  This guilt by
(assumed) association is not fair nor persuasive.
Being against porn does not mean one is pro-censorship.  (I don't
like smoking, but I don't think it should be illegal.)  We need
something more concrete to support such an accusation.
Really?  I though she very clearly has stated that she hates the
sin, not the sinner.  What evidence does Alan have that she has
had "some problems coming to terms..."?
As does Alan.
Well Alan can say anything he wants, but he has given no *substantive* reasons to support his prejudices.  By her article
against Net censorship, Schlafly has given us at least one piece
of evidence to the contrary.
Jesus hung out with tax collectors and prostitutes.  Look at the
people he chose to associate with.  Guilt by association again?
Look folks, in this battle, "the enemy of my enemy is my friend."
We KNOW what Clinton and his gang think of our privacy and freedom of speech on the Net.  Let's not cut off our noses to spite our faces.  If Schlarly wants to lend a hand, let's not

Dollar bills are a financial asset, but they are not a capital
asset.  Bart may fear all he wants, but he is still confusing the two
meanings of the word.
Here is where Bart's confusion lies.  If he is talking about
investment dollars, they none of his Austrian quotes bear any
relationship to his conclusion.  If he is talking about shipping
steel mills overseas, there might be some justification, but I
don't think that's what he is talking about.  Finally, he as not shown why US investors would move their
capital (of whatever nature) from non-competitive US companies
to foreign ones.  As I said in a previous post, the most likely
to happen is that US investors will move their capital (of
whatever nature) from non-competitive US companies to other US
companies that do enjoy a competitive advantage.
On a personal note:  Bart the people on this list are highly
intelligent.  Many if not most are students of Austrian economics.  By the tone of your posts my best guess is that you
are young (20's?) and have little practical experience in "the
real world."  This is not a crime, but it's no great honor either.  The people you have been tilting with are not arguing
just to be arguing.  They have a firm grasp of the subject matter
and fine analytical minds.  Your arguments to authority are okay,
but you show a serious intellectual inflexiblity.  I sincerely suggest you reconsider your demeanor on this list to date, and work to improve it.  Don't waste your reputation capital being a

Illogical collectivist claptrap.  When a taxpayer is targeted by terrorists, he has been victimized twice--first by the government that stole his money, second by the terrorist that punished him
for the (alleged) acts others commited with that money.  If a
mugger buys a gun with the money he took from me, am I then
responsible for the murder he commits with it?  Clearly not.  This line of "reasoning" is nothing more than a sad variant of the old, "blame the victim" game.  For shame.
Let's bring this back to crypto for a moment.  Dimitri's "logic"
must necessarily lead one to the conclusion that Cypherpunks (at
least those in the US) are responsible for whatever draconian
restrictions "our" government puts on free speech, crypto or
whatever.  John Gilmore, Philip Zimmermann, Whit Diffie and others will be chagrined to learn this, I'm sure.
Dimitri needs to learn what it means to be an adult.  Everyone is totally responsible for what they do, but ONLY for what THEY do.  No one is responsible for the unassisted, willful acts of others.

Incorrect.  Dale is assuming facts not in evidence.  See below.
Than perhaps attacks against Dale are appropriate since he takes
credit for supporting these people.
Well, I don't know what "etc." is supposed to include, but I don't vote.  But even assuming, arguendo, that I did, (a) I see
no support if I were to vote AGAINST government assassins who
are none the less elected, and (b) even a self-defense vote for the lesser of two evils is an awfully thin thread on which to hang a death sentence.  Should Sofie, in the movie, "Sofie's Choice" have been put to death because she exercise the "choice"

SANDY SANDFORT
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Last week I offered an informal poll as to the reputational effect of "John Anonymous MacDonald" and other apparent nyms.
I received responses from 31 of you.  All were signed by known
Cypherpunks; none were anonymous.  I was not surprised to find absolutely zero respect for "Anonymous."  In addition, there were
no negative comments about Tim and in most cases, high marks for
his restraint and dignity under the circumstances.  Perhaps not
so surprisingly, a significant number of you expressed the belief that the "Anonymous" posts come from Demetri Vulis.  Following, are a few samples of what respondents had to say.  (They are
reproduced without atribution because I had not asked permission
to do so in my origninal poll request.)
 S a n d y
Clearly, John Anonymous MacDonald is losing points. Tim's reputation
is unaffected.
... I'd be suprised if anyone regarded Anonymous with any degree of respect anymore.  As for Tim May, he already had a good rep in my book to start with, and by not responding in a similar matter (at least not publicly)  to these people, his reputation is enhanced even more.
Who is John Anonymous MacDonald...We can only surmise that his real joy is playing with himself in public.
Anonymous is a total moron who'd be annoying me greatly
if I hadn't managed a decent killfile.
The posts are idiotic and childish, and reflect quite badly on the
sender (presumably Dmitri Vulis KOTM).  If anything, they provide a
reason to pay *more* attention to tcmay.
As with any public display of poor taste, anonymous shows themselves lackjing in
judgement. I credit Tim for not responding.
I personally think that these anonymous attacks are pointless.  They are
just stupid insults, and they don't do anything negative to Tim's
reputation except show that someone likes abusing remailers.  Perhaps
Tim's reputation may get enhanced by the fact that someone has to go this
low to debase him.
It seems to me that anyone who is unwilling to allow the abused party to respond personally is undeserving of anyone's respect. To feel the need to do it in a public forum with however many thousands of people are on these lists is a sign of insecurity and weakness...
Tarnished - John Anonymous MacDonald
Enhanced - Tim May (due to his restraint!)
Tim's reputation is definately being enhanced, if it's fair to judge a man by the ememies he keeps.  ;)
...Since these annoying posts started a week or so ago, I have
(for the first time ever) begun killfiling people and messages
on the cp list.  Right now I am killing all messages from John Anonymous MacDonald, Dmitri Vulis, and any message
in the "daily ... regarding TCM" thread(s).  I hope this madness
can end, so we can get back to more normal traffic levels on the
Dimitri 'Anonymous' Vulis' reputation has gone
way out on the negative side.
(He's been an obvious nutcase from the start...)
TC May's positive reputation has increased from
his handling of these attacks.
This kind of post shows Anonymous to be at the social level of a grade
school child.  If s/he grows up, I may change my mind.
It does nothing to effect my opinion of Tim May...
Anonymous is making a public mockery of him/herself.
The anono-twits lose by a mile....
...It's not much different from graffiti - some people put up
interesting posters on walls and telephone poles, and
write interesting stuff on bathroom walls; others scrawl
empty vulgarity...
Anonymous's reputation went instantly from 0 to negative infinity.
Tim May's reputation is unaffected.
It certainly does nothing to harm Tim's reputation, from where I
stand.  Thank God for procmail!
Well, as Tim has managed to sit back and take it, and I've killfiled the main perpetrators.  I'd say it makes a public mockery of Anonymous.
...it seems evident that some non-anonymous posters aka KTOM seem to understand how to *abuse*  our American freedom's but don't understand about
*responsible*  use.
Is this a deliberate attempt to damage this list or is it that some folk
just can't handle freedom?
...I killfile Foolish Voolish and most of the others, just
because of these ridiculous ad hominem attacks on Tim.
Anonymous' claims make him look stupid simply because they have no technical or
political message - just dirty words...Tim May's reputation is enhanced, I think, by the fact that *other people* come
in and dispute Anonymous' claims, over and over again.

Bay Area Cypherpunks,
I am hereby pledging US$100 towards a fund to fly Dimitri to the

meet a real cryptographer, and I'm sure many of you would too.
We should throw in a hotel room and local transportation as well.  I want Dimitri to be our featured speaker--his choice of topic, of course.
I am ABSOLUTELY serious in this offer, but I will need donations
from other Cypherpunks.  If I get sufficient pledges to cover Dimitri's travel expenses, I will coordinate with Dimitri and
make the necessary travel and hotel arrangements.
Dimitri, what say you?  Are you willing in flying to California to address the Mother of All Cypherpunk Meetings?  I hope so.
I'm sure it would be one of our most highly attended meetings.

I just totaled up the "Bring Dimitri to San Francisco" pledges.
The pledges add up to an amazing US$681 and some guava pastries.
Airfair should be around US$300.  That, plus hotel should come
in under the amount pledged so far.  I'd still like additional
pledges, however,  I want to be certain we're covered and as an expression of the mood of the list. I intend to front the entire amount myself and then ask the
"pledge partners" for a pro rated payment based on the actual
cost and their proportionate pledge amount.  It's interesting to me that several pledges have come from list
members who are far removed from San Francisco.  One or two of
them plan to attend Dimitri's meeting, but most just want to
have it happen.  I've only had one request for anonymity, but I
have kept names confidential without a clear go-ahead from them.
(If you have already pledged or pledge in the future, please let
me know if you mind if I post your name/nym.)
Now there's only one thing missing--Dimitri's response.  My open
letter to him contained an explicit and unambiguous invitation
to address a Cypherpunk meeting on any topic he wanted.  I asked
him for a clear yes or no, but have received nothing.  Perhaps
Dimitri prefers shooting from ambush.

to my invitation?  If so, I never saw it.  Does anyone have any idea why Dimitri uses the term "threat"?  I have not threatened Dimitri and I have indicated that as my guest he will be under the mantle of my protection.  He'll be safer here than he is in his own bed.
Assuming /arguendo/ that such threats have been made, I hereby
request that anyone making such threats desist.  I further pledge
that I will personally hire a lawyer to defend Dimitri if any such suit is brought in California.  (If someone wants to sue

The "threat" has to do with his postings to this list, not with

Dimitri is certainly welcome to bring his video with him, but just sending the tape defeat the whole purpose of a physical meeting.  When we have speakers, there are opportunities to expand or contract one's talk to conform to the particular audience's interests.

SANDY SANDFORT
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In San Francisco, my experience has been different.  I have used
a Visa debit (check) card to rent cars from both Enterprise and
Thrifty (and maybe Dollar, I don't remember how I paid for that
one).  No one even blinked.  (It's a "gold" debit card, but I doubt that makes any difference.)  Maybe it's a regional thing.
TRUE STORY--I've used cash to rent vehicles a couple of times,
though not recently.  The most interesting was on a trip to Arizona a dozen years, or so, ago.  I flew into Phoenix and
needed transportation up to Flagstaff.  I didn't have ANY credit
cards at the time.
When I went to the car rental counter, I didn't mention my lack
of credit cards before the young woman behind the counter had
filled out all the forms.  I wanted her to have an investment in
the transaction.  When she asked for my credit card, I told her
I didn't have one and would make a cash deposit.  I had plenty of
extra cash for that purpose.  Evidently, she had never done a cash transaction.  She told me that I would have to make a deposit of $30 (!) and would need two forms of photo ID.
Well, I had a California license and no other official ID.  I asked her if a company ID would suffice.  When she said it would,
I pulled out the "Bank Courier" ID card I had made with my own
two little hands.  It had my signature, description, photo and this legend on the back:
Tho rental clerk read the legend, turned the card over, saw the
faint red bank seal stamp, nodded her head and processes the
rental agreement.
For $30, I was the keys for a brand new car worth thousands of dollars.  I was within 200 driving miles of the Mexican border.
After I drove away, I realized that the woman had been so flustered by the cash transaction that she had forgotten to have
me sign the rental agreement.  (Upon returning the car the next
day, I pointed out the omission to her and asked if she would like for me to sign then.  In a low conspiratorial voice she ernestly asked me to do so.  Life is strange.

I have no such plan because I feel nothing but moral, cultural,

California out of curiosity.  I studied slime mold in biology
class for the same reason.  He has been made a generous offer.  It still stands.  It's his decision to be either a man our a mouse (or a slime mold).  If he grows some gonads, I'll be very

social behavior in another.  Giving someone the benefit of a
doubt is not a bad thing, but to continue doing so indefinitely
is.  I'll let my offer of airfare, lodging and transportation stand through the end of the month, then it will automatically be withdrawn and the pledge partners will be off the hook.  If
Dimitri wishes to address a future meeting of SF Bay area Cypherpunks at our expense, he must unequivocally commit to it
before midnight (California time) October 31.  After that, it will be up to him to pay his own way or to pass the plate on his
own.  (Personally, I'm convinced that he is far to big a coward
to ever come here, no matter what the inducement.)
Other than with regard to my offer, I am taking RW's pledge.

Yes, Dale is missing something, not the other way around.
(a) What John did was NOT censorship.  Dale's sloppy choice of     language to the contrary notwithstanding.
(b) Nobody on this list gave up any freedom.  And we are still     the beneficiaries of John's largesse, not his victims.
(c) Freedom has been defended not limited.  If Dimitri or even
    a majority of Cypherpunks could overrule Johns control of
    his own resources, then there would have been a loss of
    freedom with dangerous implications for us all. Would Dale be so tolerant if Dimitri were loudly using abusive
language towards Dale's mother and others in her own livingroom?  Would he accuse her of censorship if she asked Dimitri to leave?  What would he say if she kicked Dimitri out?  Enquiring minds

and in reality.  John has graciously provided us with a venue for our never-ending Cypherpunk salon.  I think my example of an

Of course Igor does.  As does Dimitri.  And John has the right to kick him off if he so desires.  What igor does not have--and never did have--was a right to arbitrarily use John's resources
contrary to John's wishes.
Perhaps Igor did not understand my point, or I did not make myself clear enough.  I was illustrating the only way someone's freedom could be lost given the current controversy.  Ironically, giving Dimitri the boot has benefited the Cypherpunk
list in at least two ways.  It has vastly lowered the level of
ugly flames and personal attacks.  It has also provided us with a wonderful opportunity to explore such concepts as censorship,
freedom, rights and property.  I much prefer it when this list
is a forum for ideas rather than a outlet for spoiled tantrums
by the emotionally challenged.

Dale is wrong.  All access to Cypherpunks is via toad.com which sits in John Gilmore's home.  (The basement office to be exact.)
And here John has chosen to limit said forum.  It is irrelevant
how many subscribers perceive the list as public.  It is private.
Their misperception is in no way binding on John.
a) "Against stupidity, the gods themselve, contend in vain."
   Some folks just don't have a clue.  Just because they don't
   understand the nature of John's contribution, does not stop
   them from yammering.
b) There are those who do understand the private nature of the
   list, but think that John has made a mistake.  They may
   certainly try to convince him of the error of his ways without

Wrong on two counts:
1) Strictly speaking, the C'punks list is primarily concerned    with privacy.  Of course, most of us seem to have strong
   interest in freedom, but the original intent of the list    founders was the "self-help" preservation of privacy through
   technological means. 2) Putting aside that nit-pick, we are still left with two     implicit and unsupported assumptions:
   a) military=government.     b) military/government doesn't also threaten freedoms.
As to a), market anarchists (aka, anarcho-capitalists) believe
that militaries would be better provided by private business.
The concept is usually called "private defense agencies."  The
conservative preference is for para-military "militias."  I have
no intention of getting into a debate over these concepts.  I
mention it only for the purpose of pointing out that alternative
do exist and the fact that governments--through force of the
threat of force--maintain their monopoly hold on the instruments
of war does not mean we are better off for that fact.
With regard to b), governments--primarily through the use of their militaries--have killed, by some counts 170,000,000, men,
women and children in this century alone.  Hardly the guardians
of freedom, in my opinion.
He says that as if it's a bad thing.
Actually, this is not true either.  In the US at least, if a law
is unconstitutional, it is void ab initio.  The military ananlogy
is found in the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  A subordinate
is not required to follow an order that violates the UCMJ.  The
international version was enunciated at the Nurenburg trials. "I
was only following orders" is not esculpatory.
To some people, yes.  Literally--and that's how most libertarians
and anarchists use it--it means no rulers.  In my opinion, observation and experience and experience rulers, government and
military imply ruthlessness far more directly.

Colorful, yet sadly ineffectual.  No, it's Cypherpunks (and others).           ^^^^^^^^^^^
Perhaps you are laboring under a misconception.  Cypherpunks is
about the use of technology to protect privacy.  Perhaps you were confusing it with that other list you are on:

Phil Zimmermann often tells the story of a woman whose marriage
was destroyed by the revelation of a long-past indiscretion. After her husband divorced her, she committed suicide.
Any number of celebrities have been stalked, attacked and even
killed by obsessed fans who found them through public records.
Every year, children and business executives are kidnapped for
ransom.  The proximate cause of these kidnappings is a breach in
privacy about the whereabouts and schedules of the victim.  Hitler's gun registration in Germany allowed the Jews to be
disarmed.  I'm sure you are aware of the ultimate consequences
of that little invasion of privacy.
The US Post Office co-operated in the identification and imprisonment of people of Japanese ancestry during the second
world war.
The problem with having a whole lot of private information about
you floating around in public is not what damage it can do to you
now, but rather the problems it potentially could cause in the
future.  Just about everyone on this list has been to university.
Not long ago, a college education was essentially a death warrant in Cambodia.  Prior to that, a degree was considered a good thing
there.  People saw no reason to hid the fact that they had been
in school.  Trouble is, things changed.
And the trouble today is that things can change now, too.  Think
about the things that you have publicly done or advocated.  Even
if they are as legal as church on Sunday NOW, how comfortable will you be about them if there is extreme right or left takeover
in the future?  Start to get the picture?

Note in the following exchange that HC firsts asks for examples
of harm, then when clearly unambiguous examples are given, tries to imply that the examples are rare, trivial or (most amazingly)
that the victim did suffer, but must have deserved his/her fate!
Really?  What if the spouse is violently abusive?  You might want to leave him and NOT be tracked down and killed.
Unfortunately?  You don't have to be famous to be stalked.  Many
ordinary people are being dogged by former or would-be paramors.
Is it HC's contention that this is only a problem when a majority of Cypherpunks suffer from it?
How fatuous.
They happens all to often.  Is this response supposed to be joke?
Yeah, I guess HC is right, the slow ones deserved it.
Yeah, just a few.  Okay by me and HC, I recon.
The odds approach unity over time.
NOYB.  More importantly, since you seem to think privacy isn't
all that important why don't you give us your true name, date of
birth, SS mother's maiden name, address where you sleep at night, pictures of you (and your family), etc.?  After all, as you wrote, the "odds are low" anything will come of it.

The trouble with sparbuchs is that they are legally available only to Austrians.  The answer to this given by promoters is that
since no ID can be required of Austrians and the passbook is in
essence a bearer instrument, the law cannot be enforced.  As far
as I can tell, though, one would really need to handle one's
business through an Austrian to keep from having to answer embarrassing questions.  In addition, I personally would not do

There is a simple solution to keeping anonymous posters anonymous
under this or any similar scheme.  Volunteers could act as

The gateway volunteers would be a firewall against flames and

First, I did not use it as a legal term of art, so a legal dictionary is not appropriate.  Second, I see no sustantive difference between "forejudgment" and my shorthand version (pre-judge).  Third, I wrote "literal."  Examine the etimology of the word for it's literal meaning.  It's pretty obvious AND
specific [ME.; OFr, /prejudice/ (Fr. /prejudice/); L praejudicium/,
from /prae/, before, and /judicium/, a judgment, from /judex/,
I have no intention nor duty to satisfy everyone.  That is not
possible.  I will use a "reasonable person" test.  (I am, by the way, using this in the legal term of art sense.)
Other folks on this list seem to have other opinions.  That's why
there are horse races.  I don't like it, but Toto are free to wallow in it if he chooses.
Somehow, I don't think that will be a problem, as this debate has demonstrated.

Sophist, paranoid nonsense.  This one-month test is of a moderated *Cypherpunks* list.  So there was no renaming.
The unedited list was a gimme for cry babies such as Dale.  When the test is complete, things will go back to the previous
status if that's what folks want.  If not, Cypherpunks will continue as a moderated list (of some sort, further test may be
conducted if list members want). (a) If it were transparent, it wouldn't fool anyone, now would it?
(b) I've stated it all clear enough so that only the most naive
    persons could infer an attempt to fool anyone.
(c) "The public" has nothing to do with it.  This is a private list.
Maybe after the test if that's what folks want.  In the meantime,
hey Dale, knock yourself out.

Normally, I would not comment one way or the other on this sort
of thing.  We have a whole alphabet soup of aliases out there and
I don't intend to waste time with denials.  Heck, it helps keep

I won't be censoring anyone.  I will, however, be sorting posts into the three lists.  As I work my way into moderation mode, I
don't expect to sort math or other off-topic posts into the flam
(flames & spam) list.  In retrospect, the previous "creeps" comment should probably have gotten the post sorted to the flam
list.  Oh well, I'll get up to speed pretty soon, I hope.

While free speech is an undeniably important topic, It is just
one of many that could be discussed on this list.  A concern for
protecting privacy was the raison d'etre for the creation of the Cypherpunks list.  And technological self-help was always the modus operandi of choice.  Obviously, speech and privacy issues
are related, but they are not synonymous.  Again, I am not saying
Cypherpunks do not care about free speech issues.  There focus,
though, is on achieving privacy through technological means.
Works for me.

a) NO posts have been "tossed out."  Your response was sorted
   into the "flames" list--not because it flamed directly, but
   because it was part of the threat started by Dimitri in which
   he engaged in flaming.  b) While I realize this is a judgment call that others might    dispute, I don't think it makes much sense to post to the    moderated list only the parts of threads that are not flamish.     I would rather keep thread intact on one list or the other.     There are exceptions.  I put one of Dimitri's post on this    thread into the moderated list because the point he made did
   not require particular knowledge of the entire thread and had    non-inflamatory relevance.
Perhaps, but crypto-relevance is NOT the criterion by which I am
moderating the list.  I am sort on the basis of (a) emotional,
non-relevant personal attacks on list members, and (b) spam.  I believe (and so far the postings have borne me out) that in an
atmosphere of civil, reasoned discourse, the relevance issue will
largely take care of itself.
By the way, contrary to what Dimitri has alleged, I have posted
every message from him in which he was able to restrain himself
with regard to gratuitous insults and/or spam.  In other words, the set of Dimitri posts that have appeared on the moderated list
is not the null set.
By the way number two, this response will be posted to the flames
list and NOT the moderated list.  Even though I have not flamed
anyone, two things keep it off the moderated list:  (1) my policy
about keeping thread on the same list where possible (see above),
and (2) basic precepts of fairness.  Though Dimitri has stated--
without a scintilla of evidence--that my moderation policy would
be used to attack him and not give him the opportunity or forum
to defend himself, I am keeping ALL personal attacks off the moderated list.  Those who are subscribed to the "flam" postings
can see numerous unkind posts about Dimitri that I have not allowed on the moderated list.  That policy applies to me just as much as to anyone else.

Apparently, Toto does not know very much about John or me or our relationships with the "Establishment."  It is who are using a
intellectually dishonest smokescreen of "freedom of speech" in order to disrupt and hamper the work of Cypherpunks who are dancing into the arms of the "Establishment."
I can't speak for John, but my goals have been stated too often
and too completely for anyone not to know them.  I want us all to
have privacy.  The Cypherpunks list was created to facilitate
discussion--and ultimately action by those who were inclined and able to do something to further that goal via the use of
cryptographic and other technologies.  I believe that childish
name-calling and personal attacks interferes with rational discourse and a spirit of common purpose and community.  It is obvious to me that those who are waving the bloody flag of
"censorship" are doing so for either of two reasons.  The ones to
whom I am the most sympathetic are those who simply do not have
a clear and coherent understanding of rights in an anarchistic,
volunteeristic society.  The ones for whom I have no sympathy are those whose obvious goal is disruption of the Cypherpunks list and who are hiding
behind a phoney interpretation of "free speech."
I think both of these groups are intellectually dishonest in the
extreme when it comes to telling others how this list should be
run.  I doubt any of them would permit the sort of disruptive
behavior that goes on here to go unchallenged in salons they
sponsor in their own homes or on Net lists that they themselves This is a voluntary list folks.  We tried incivility and that did
not work.  Right now we are experimenting with reasoned discourse
in an atmosphere of interpersonal respect and good will.  If most
list members like the change, it will continue.  If not, then we
can go back to the swill or perhaps try something else.  In the
meantime, get over it.  If you really like flames and spam, show
John and me how it really should be done.  Start another list.  Of course squating and claim jumping appeal to the lazy a lot

Nonsense.  It was supposed to be a discussion of crypto and other technologies in support of privacy.  The founders, Hughes,
Gilmore, May and Daniel were focusing on that goal.  The list
structure was anarchistic (and still is to those who understand
the concept of anarco-capitalism).  Obviously Gilmore is not
wedded to the idea of letting every fool use his bandwidth.  In
personal discussions as recently as yesterday, Hughes had no
problem in supporting some mechanism to promote civility on the
list.  I don't think anything May has written would suggest he
would have a problem with keeping things polite.  His only argument seems to be over methodology.  He thinks filtering is
the answer; I don't.  Reasonable minds may differ.  Hugh Daniel
has been instrumental in providing technical help with regard to
moderation.  Finally, the fact that the vast majority of list
members have not seen fit to "vote with their feet" should suggest how most really feel about moderation.  (By the way, if
you don't like moderation, you would hate Eric Hughes' favored Again, nonsense.  The moderation experiment (moderation, not
censorship) has been in effect for all of ONE WEEK.  Where does Paul get this hysterical "recent months" stuff?

I'm curious about the gratuitous use of the word "forcibly" by
Paul.  Does this mean Gilmore took a fire axe to the computer or
something?  Dimitri was unsubscribed.  It was done more or less
against his will.  ("More or less" because he in effect said to
John, "bet you can't stop me.")  What does "forcibly" add to this
discussion besides melodrama?  No force was required.  John had
the right and ability to pull the plug on Dimitri.  "No animals
were harmed in the making of this film."  "Force," my ass.
There are various definitions of "censorship" and various flavors
of anarchism.  I'm a market anarchist, Paul is not.  Paul claims
to believe that any form of moderation is censorship.  I think
that enforcing standards of decorum on a private, voluntary list
are not censorship.  Reasonable minds may differ.  I acknowledge that Paul's interpretations are not without some justification.
(I just think they are incorrect in the instant case.)  Paul, on
the other hand, seems to be a True Believer.  He brooks no view
other than his own.  (Curiously hypocritical under the Paul's sophistry is showing.  Nation-states are entities that
exercise a monopoly on the use of force (real force, Paul)
within (and often without) their boundries.  Mail lists are far
more like private homes, businesses or clubs.  When you are a
guest there, you are subject to their rules of behavior.
Several substantive examples, please.  True, nothing Bill Stewart
has posted has been sent to CP-Flames.  One guess why.  Numerous
posts by Dimitri have been posted to CP-Moderated, but many more
have not made the cut.  There are much more obvious reasons for
this than Paul's biased analysis.

Interestingly, the saying, "to let the cat out of the bag" is
related to the saying, "to buy a pig in a poke."  A poke is a
sack or bag.  In times past, street peddlers would sell a mark a young pig.  The pig was supposedly put into a poke, but in fact,
a bag with a cat in it was substituted.  By the time the mark
figured out his mistake by "letting the cat out of the bag," the
peddler was long gone.  The lesson the mark learned was "Don't
buy a pig in a poke."
The better metaphor for crypto is that the genie is out of the
bottle.  Alternatively, that the crypto bell cannot be unrung.

That's why we call it a test.  I have no software.  Everything
I'm doing is manual.  Whatever John has done is probably jerry
rigged just for the test.  If list members opt for moderation, more effort will be put into
the moderation infrastructure.  The idea right now is to see how
well a first aproximation of moderation works.  If it seems like
a step in the right direction, great.  If everyone thinks it
sucks, well that's great too.

I'm ending my participation in the moderation of the list.  It would have been an interesting experiment if list members had been open minded enough to give it a good faith effort.  Instead,
those who weren't even willing to give another approach a try, set out to sabotage it and destroy any possibility of a meaningful test of the concept.  I see no reason to prolong the agony.
I've asked John to take me out of the loop as soon as possible.
If he can't get that done right away, I'll continue to moderate
in some capacity so that list members aren't cut off.  However,
I'm going to take a break today to help a friend move into her

 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Where to begin?  Tim May has taken the time to write broad and
thought provoking essay on this list's current moderation experiment.  I appreciate his analysis--and candor.  While I do
not agree with all he has written, I enormously respect his
dedication to his point of view.  This is Tim's first error of fact.  I point it out not to insult
him, but because it seriously affects much of the rest of his
analysis.  We are conducting an experiment.  It will last one month.  After that, it's over if list members want it to be over.
If, on the other hand, moderation is seen by the list members as
beneficial to their use and enjoyment of the list, the current
form of moderation--or some variation will continue.
Factual error   There was a call for comment; Tim chose not to
do so.  In retrospect, I wish we had run it by Tim, Eric and Hugh in more detail before making the annoucement, but we didn't.
Certainly a tactical error and a breach of protocol, but not the
end of the world.  Sorry Tim.  I should have spoken to you first.
And I see something different.  Since previously, Tim actively
filter the list, I'm not sure on what basis he can make his
comparison.  As just one example (though a signicant one) Dimitri
has posted more non-flaming, on-topic posts during the two weeks
of this experiment then in the previous several months.  In my opinion, other than for the hysterical posts of a very few self-righteous loudmouths, the overall quality of the posts has
been far superior to what it had become in the weeks before the
experiment began.  YMMV.
I would hope that Tim will return to this practice irrespective
of whether the list remains moderated or returns to its previous
policies.  More on this, below.
Two points:  Since Tim largely agrees with those in opposition to
moderation, and because of the extraordinary nature of Tim's post,
I did not send it to the "flames" list.  It was a judgment call.
The problems Tim describes, did not arise with moderation.  Indeed, they were the imputus for the moderation.
I think this is a Straw Man.  John and I have never argued that
John "owns" cypherpunks.  When a Cypherpunk meeting is held in
someone's living room, however, I don't think it's asking to much
to ask everyone to follow the local rules (e.g., "no shoes in the
house" or "no smoking" or even "no ad hominem attacks").  As Tim
is fond of saying, "my house; my rules."  I don't think this means Tim "owns" a physical meeting in his house.
Tim, do you really believe that John did not anticipate this?
It was consumed with flames before.  Now, at least, the vast
majority of folks on the list don't have to read them, nor jump
through any hoops to implement some sort of dynamic filtering
That's what journalist do, though I wasn't aware of ANY articles
on this issue.  I would appreciate it if Tim could give us some
citations.  That's one message that one could take from all this, I suppose.
I don't see it that way, nor do several list members who thanked me in private e-mail for improving the list.  Again, YMMV.
What didn't work was "local filtering" which has no feed-back loop to engender comity.  This might not work either, but I see
no evidence that it has made things worse.  Remember, there are a
hand-full of subscribers to the Flames list, 20-30 on the Unedited list and *2000* or so on the Moderated list.  Sure some
of that may be due to laziness, but it would be cavalier in the
extreme to claim that such an overwhelming acceptance of moderation is merely an artifact of inertia.
But to make things perfectly clear one more time, ANYONE WHO WANTS TO READ THE ENTIRE CYPHERPUNKS FEED SHOULD SUBSCRIBE TO "CYPHERPUNKS-UNEDITED" AND/OR "CYPHERPUNK-FLAMES."  Tim and I disagree on which definition of "censorship" applies in
this situation.  Dale Thorne, and others, have argued, in essence,
that there is censorship if ANY definition would apply.  I'm not
sure time is going that far, but if so, I respectfully disagree.
But let's apply Tim's above definition for the sake of argument.
Am I, thereby, a censor?  Well I am examining "other material" and I am making judgments with regard to whether or not it is
"objectionable," unfortunately for Tim's argument, I am neither
"removing" nor "supressing" anything.  Anybody can read anything
that gets posted to Cypherpunks--in two places.  I am sorting,
but even my sorting can be completely avoided.
John didn't choose me, I approached him.  I offered my opinion as
to what I thought HE ought to do about the list disruptions.  The
short version of his answer was, "if you think you can do a better job, go for it."  I accepted the challenge, so here I am.
I don't want this job.  If the list members decide to keep the list moderated, I hope to keep my involvement as a moderator to a
minimum.  Any volunteers?
Very possibly true.  Moderation is like crypto, perfection isn't
and option.  However, a 90% solution is a heck of a lot better than no solution at all.  Yes, I've made what I consider to be
errors, but I think on some, I've done a very good job overall.
Tim, I think this is disingenuous.  I have been quite clear on my moderation criteria.  You are too intelligent to feign such
a lack of understanding.
Clearly not a criterion I ever enunciated.
Clearly not a criterion I ever enunciated.
Bingo (with the proviso that it be a personal attack on a list
member as opposed to the substance of his or her argument).
Piffle.  Letting spoiled children destroy the list puts a far
more powerful weapon in the hands of our enemies.
I do not have a crystal ball.  My Vulcan mind meld is in the shop.  No one--neither Tim, nor I, nor probably even Vulis--knows whether is gleeful about all this or not.  An frankly, who cares?
The question is, are list members happy or not with moderation.
Tim was not.  I am.  By the end of the experiment, I dare say we
will have a good idea what most list members think. I sorry Tim gives me so little credit.  Rather than merely post a self-serving denial, I would ask that Phill confirm or deny Tim's
supposition.  To the best of my recollection, I have sent only
one post of Phill's to the Flames list.  It flamed Jim Bell.  As
far as moderating political rants go, I'm agnostic.
Look folks, when you stop trying new things, and stop questioning
conventional wisdom, you are as good as dead.  Maybe moderation
is the best think since sliced bread; maybe it sucks.  How about
we give it a good-faith try for the next 2+ weeks and see how it goes?  If the consensus is it sucks, I intend to be gracious in
defeat.  If it goes the other way, I hope that the neighsayers will accept it and let the list get on with its role as a forum
for the protection of privacy.
Thanks again, Tim, for sharing your views with us.

But they are not ad hominem attacks on Tim May.  The are my
opinions of some of his arguments.  Even very smart people such
as Tim say poorly thought out or even silly things.  Nor I, Tim's.  Nothing personal, but that's the point.  It is
still possible to conduct ourselves with mutual respect even if our views and styles differ.
After reading through Tim's post, I don't think much would be
served by doing another point by point response.  From Tim's
tone, it appears he is still seething about how this all came
about, so I'll just leave our two expressions of opinions where
they were.  I have no wish to exacerbate any hard feelings Tim
may be having.

If I wasn't clear, I'm sorry.  I think the quality of content
and the degree of civility have improved.  My extreme example was
the increase in polite, on-topic posts from Dimitri, but are others.  That's the sort of improvement to which I was referring.

           OCTOBER 18 IN HISTORY
This is "Any Way You Look at It" Day! On this day in 1961, Henri Matisse's painting, "Le Bateau" went on display in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.  For six days, nobody realized it was hanging upside down.
1842 - Samuel Finley Breese Morse, laid his first telegraph cable in New York Harbor between the Battery and Governor's 1892 - The first long-distance telephone communication was established between the mayors of New York and Chicago.
1924 - The term "Four Horsemen" was used in a "New York Herald Tribune" article by columnist Grantland Rice.  The referenced Four Horsemen were the backfield of the University of Notre Dame which had beaten Army, 13-7. 1935 - Victor record  was recorded this day by Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra. It would become one of the most familiar Big Band themes of all time: "I'm Getting Sentimental Over You". 1943 - The first broadcast of "Perry Mason" was presented on CBS Radio. In the 15-minute (Monday-Friday) shows, Perry was played by Barlett Robinson, Santos Ortega, Donald Briggs and John Larkin. Larkin played the role the longest and was reportedly very disappointed when Raymond Burr got the gig on TV (1957). 1944 - The epic book, "Forever Amber", was published.  This historic-romance novel was written by Kathleen Windsor. Although the book was very popular among women between the ages of 12 and 24, it was considered scandalous to be seen reading it; a reaction that lasted at least another three decades. 1956 - Football commissioner Bert Bell turned thumbs down on the use of radio-equipped helmets by NFL quarterbacks.  1971 - The final issue of "Look" magazine was published. It had been a must-see publication every week for 34 years. 1977 - Reggie Jackson made history and earned the nickname, Mr. October.  Regg-a-roo (as Howard Cosell called him) hit three home runs on three successive pitches leading the Yankees to an
8-4 thrashing of the LA Dodgers in Game 6 of the World Series. 1979 - Following extensive renovation to return Radio City Music Hall to the look and feel of its 1931 Art Deco glory, the venerable New York City theatre reopened. "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" was the first live presentation. 1983 - Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton received some gold to add to their collections --for their smash, "Islands in the Stream".
