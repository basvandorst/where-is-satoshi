:Helsinki, Finland, December 15, 1998-- Data Fellows, the global leader in
:developing data security software solutions, has been invited to join the
:Microsoft Security Partners Program.
"Invited"?   You mean they finally accepted your application, right?
:The Microsoft Security Partners Program
:( provides customers with the
:tools and information they need to establish, test and maintain effective
:information security for their computing infrastructure. By providing real-life examples of how NOT to implement security
practices.  By simply purchasing these failed products (at only *slightly*
exhorbitant prices), so can learn by example: see for yourself just how
easy it is to completely botch a security directive.  Witness how
thoroughly you can mangle password encryption.  Learn what major design
flaws *really* look like!
:The program brings
:together software manufacturers, security consultants and security
:trainers, making it even easier for customers to provide robust security in
:their Microsoft Windows NT operating system-based networks.
Just as soon as it becomes available?  Oh, BTW, when *will* that be???
:Three Data Fellows products are included in the Microsoft Security Partners
:Program. I'm sorry.  But don't worry, if you keep working on it, you'll be able to
sell it to a *real* vendor someday...
:F-Secure Workstation Suite consists of malicious code detection
:and removal as well as unobtrusive file and network encryption,
Very unobtrusive, I'm sure!  Does the attacker even know it's there?
: all
:integrated into a policy-based management architecture. Hmmm... Somebody's been playing with their buzzword-generator again :)
:F-Secure VPN+
:provides a software-based, IPSec/IKE VPN solution scaleable for large
:corporate networks as well as remote and small office networks.
Was that IPSec/IKE, or IPSec-like?  I vote for the latter.  It's just like
IPSec, but without wasting all those nasty cycles on dumb things - like
encryption: it's *so much* more user-friendly when it doesnt [further]
slow the speed of new window open/closes...
: F-Secure
:FileCrypto is the first and only product to integrate strong real-time
:encryption directly into the Windows NT-based file system.
Could be, we already know that Micro$loth has *no clue* when it comes to
these things (Right Paul???)...
:"Microsoft is pleased to include Data Fellows as part of its Security
:Partners Program," said Karan Khanna, Windows NT Security Product Manager
:at Microsoft Corp.
Of course you are.  Micro$loth would be pleased to welcome Joseph Stalin
into the Security Partners Program.
: "This program will help our mutual customers develop and
:deploy secure solutions built on the Windows NT platform."
Just as soon as they can get Windows NT to run faster than a 6809 with 1k
of 512ns RAM and a single parallel port for IO ;-)
:"The relationship with Microsoft shows Data Fellows' commitment to improve
:the native security of standalone and networked computers with a
:comprehensive, centrally managed suite of security services," said Risto
:Siilasmaa, president and CEO of Data Fellows. You're *that* worried about Micro$loth's current offerings, huh?
Personally, I'd let them fend for themselves, but...
:"Data Fellows is committed to
:providing globally available And this *IS* your *FIRST* priority, isn't it?
:seamless security for Windows users; security
:that is strong yet easy to manage and economical."
Great!  Let me know when it's available!
:Data Fellows is one of the world's leading developers of data security
Really?  Who decided that?  Do you have any research to back up this
awe-inspiring claim?
: The company develops, markets and supports anti-virus, data
:security and cryptography software products for corporate computer
That's only because most of the private networks already know better.

:, that does not mean I'm willing to allow one

:enough of the worlds oil supply to impact the well-being of my country.
I believe this is the the only true argument here.  The US (and you) are
not "pleased" with the fact that the one place on the planet that has the
worlds largest oil deposits is not beholden to the USG.  If Hussein were
to have remained a US puppet, he could do pretty much as he damn well
pleased, anywhere he damn well pleased - just as long as OUR oil prices
didn't escalate.  countries like Iraq to sell oil at or below cost?  And isn't that the
entire point of "allowing" Iraq to sell oil at the rate of some 50 billion
dollars every six months (IIRC)?  On the one hand, we "embargo" all food
and medicines, for their own good of course, and on the other hand we are
"willing" to forego that embargo, *if it benefits us*.  do with the US id - we want *what* we want, *when* we want it, and at the
*price* we want it, *OR ELSE*.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...

I agree that the primary damage, and resultant attention, is [necessarily]
focused upon those whom [indirectly] had the least to do with "inflicting"
this upon us (very accurately put), however, it is also the way most
likely to generate the necessary awareness of the issues.  Our biggest
problem isn't that Wassenaar is forced upon us by bureaucrats: our problem
is that hundreds of these types of things are forced upon us every year,
and *nobody cares*.  Our people have become so totally numbed and
apathetic, that if they are not "bitten" directly, they could care less.
I submit that this strike allows them to be bitten, albeit mildly, and
that this *may* (and may very well *not*) raise their attention level a
notch or two...
