What "Communism" ?
Bolshevik-ism perpetrates heirarchies as a design principle.
This is obviously some new definition of the word "great" that I have been previously unaquainted with.

"Nonlinear models differ form linear ones in a number of ways.  Rather than trying to figure out all the chains of causality, the modeler looks for nodes where feedback loops join and tries to capture as many of the important loops as possible in the system's "picture."  Rather than shaping the model to make a forecast about future events or to exercise some central control, the nonlinear modeller is content to perturb the model, trying out different variations in order to learn about the system's critical points and its homeostasis (resitance to change).  The modeler is not seeking to control the complex system by quantifying it and mastering its causality; she wants to increase her "intuitions" about how the system works so she can interact with it more harmoniously."

It is my contention that, in the present circumstances, bombs
    are not effective devices for ending the corrupt tyrannical
    government which rules us.  They are much more likely to make
    enemies for "our cause" than they are to physically stop the
    government.  Does the phrase, "Bomb throwing anarchist" give you
    the feeling of hero, or of villain?  Most people will answer
    villain, and killing people is not likely to change their minds.
Anyone head of Non-Violent Action (NVA) ?
Seems to me writing and disseminating Code is a pretty effective form of NVA

etc etc etc . . .
I was taught in anarchist primary school that:
"Secrecy is a tool of the State".
Two daughters of a silk merchant live it Kyoto,
The elder is twenty, the younger, eighteen.
A soldier may kill with his sword,
But these girls slay men with their eyes.

@_subject: Secrecy? 
Hmmmm . . .
After following this list for a while I offer the following "Would it be better to DEMAND the full disclosure of the governments secrets rather than scramble around trying to keep ours."
I am prepared to allow governments full access to my communications when they allow me full access to theirs.
But then again, why be governed in the first place?

Hmmm . . . "The Govenment" or "GovernmentS" . . . perhaps a fine Ugly!  I do not enter into boss-employee relationships as either the boss or the employee.  I work/play WITH people FOR people as a node in the network, not a part of the heirarchy.  Ummm . . . You seem to have missed/not quoted the other part of my post.

Not only that, but the site and the client SUCK.  Oh how I hate capitalism.  Even when I try to be one of the "winners" and involve myself in it, I still hate it.  etc etc rant on Thankyou for your posts.  It pleases me to see that a bunch of crypto intellectuals will take my posts seriously.  I have been interested in this topic for a while and only recently got my shit together enough to understand how to subscribe to a mailing list.  The last time I used PGP was when it was in DOS and I found it a hassle.  Does that make me a clueless newbie?
Ummm . . . my training was in Non Violent Action (NVA).  This is being used by ppl at the moment to protect Gibblett Forest from being clear fell logged by a (IMNSHO) corrupt "Conservation and Land Management" (CALM) authority in Western Australia.
As a way of countering destructive paranoia, we have developed a doctrine of "secrecy is a tool of the state".  (I am well aware of the limitations of Doctrine as a logical formal system godelwise).
To this end, we have NO SECRETS.  Everything we do is "public domain", ie, everyone, including our "enemies" gets to know it.  In practice, this is simple, ie Civil Disobedience.  You wanna log the trees, we gonna stop you, aint no big secret. We even go to the lengths of notifying the authourites, ie CALM/police of our strategies and telling them who will be doing an arrestable action on a particular day.  At the moment we have 3 ppl up Karri trees on I find it very empowering.  I see no need for secrets.
Sure, secrecy is a tool.  I ask these questions:
1. Does it work.
2. Is it useful.  (also known as the Doctrine of Utility)
3. Does it make me happy.
I usually use these to analyse behaviour patterns, but hey . . .
1. Hmmmm . . . It kinda works, but it is a big hassle.  Then you gotta worry about looking like you are trying to hide somethang and thereby attracting attention.  Also, you get to worry about IF it does actually work and is uncrackable/contains no back door etc.
2. If you are paranoid or cannot organize yourself so that secrecy is 3. I am not sure WHAT makes me happy, but secure communications and commerce are not high on my list of priorities.  Perhaps an end to paranoia and capitalism that REQUIRE secure comms would make me Anyway . . .
Thanx for the pointer

You Crazy Americans . . . I dont think anyone else in the world would give a fuck someone burnt their countries flag, certainly not in Australia.  What is it about your country?
