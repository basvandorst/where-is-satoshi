@_subject: system logging 
People should be aware that whether Niko makes personal logs on his
qwerty account or not, the public logs on netcom show more than enough
info to trivially track people down.
By the way it's very bad practice to forge From: lines, especially
with completely non-existant site names like qwerty.org...perhaps
you should ask netcom to register it for you.  Or if they charge real
money for it, your postmaster at columbia.edu might do it for free if
you asked him nicely.

@_subject: New US keyserver now fully operational - pgp-public-keys@io.com 
The US-based keyserver  'pgp-public-keys is now open to the public.
Come one, come all!
Here is the current file as returned by 'Subject: help'.
This site is a PGP key server SLAVE site.  It behaves
very similarly to the European PGP master sites, but there
are a few small differences which will be noted below.
The most noticable difference is that it answers your
requests immediately instead of waiting for a daily
batch job to run :-)
The particular installation at io.com does *not* log the details of
requests for keys, however the fact that you have sent mail to the
key server at all is logged in the daily sendmail logs.  These logs
will be erased automatically after one week.
PGP Public Keyservers
-------- -------------------------------------------------
ADD                    Your PGP public key (key to add is body of msg)
                       *** Note: your update is forwarded to a master
                           server and may take a few days to reappear
INDEX                  List all PGP keys the server knows about (-kv)
VERBOSE INDEX          List all PGP keys, verbose format (-kvv)
GET                    Get the whole public key ring
GET 0xA1B2C3           Get a single key by Key ID
                       *** Note: the master servers allow you to omit
                           the 0x in front of the Key ID.  The slave
                           servers do not.
GET userid             Get a single key by User ID
MGET substr            List all keys which match "substr"
                       *** Note: this is different from the master servers
                           which return the keys themselves, not just a
                           listing of their Key IDs.  Also the master
                           servers accept a wild-card expression; at
                           the moment we do not.
LAST days              Get the keys updated in the last `days' days
                       *** Note: not yet implemented

I hear and obey O Master.
If you insist :-)  (Can you give me a few more days to comply?...I`m having
some trouble getting a copy of your signature.  One of the guys in the chem
faculty says he knows where he can get one at the weekend...)
Hey bud, you`ve clearly misunderstood the whole point of the movement.  You
get whatever privacy you can make for yourself through technology.  Any dolt
who goes to the extent of using two remailers and a penet id to hide his
identity then puts his nym`s secret key in his True Name signature file
gets the privacy he deserves.  Anyway, whats the big deal?...noone who
read my post will have a clue who you are unless you tell them yourself; and
anyone who could track you down from the two bits of info in that post is
more than capable of tracking you down the same way I did from the public
logs on netcom.  I was just waving enough of a red rag at you to make the
point forcefully...  (remember your the one arguing against putting delays
more than 15 minutes in a remailer system...)
The point I was making was that you cannot rely on trust such as a lack of
logs alone to keep things like remailer chains secure...you *have* to build
the security into the technology and the protocols.  You must assume that
The Bad Guys (tm) have full access to all the logs of all the machines that
run remailers...if not directly then by watching the wires.  So any remailer
scheme has to include dummy traffic, significant delays, and encrypted input
way back at the sender`s end.  And the protocol has to be such that a remailer
chain is as strong as its strongest link, not as weak as its weakest link,
meaning if 9 out of 10 remailers have been compromised but the 10`th is run by
Honest Joe, then Honest Joe`s trustworthiness is sufficient to defeat the evil
forces of TBG with there 9 bogus servers.
Yo dude, I found *you* didn`t I?  And it took me less than 5 minutes.  So
bite me.
PS How to build your own mailer logs on netcom...just stay on long enough
and keep typing `mailq`...no problemo...I can`t be bothered but if I could
thats how I`d track traffic through qwerty for your $20...

@_subject: PGP KEYS NOW BY FINGER!  *** STOP PRESS *** 
pgp key server functionality just took a great leap forward today when
io.com's email server suddenly went interactive!
finger       for details
        ^^^^^^
        Note the 'wasabi' - finger  won't work.
You can get a list of users by doing:   finger user
or even:                                finger user
And once you find their Key ID from the summary listing, you can
then do:
                                        finger 0x123456
                                                 ^^^^^^
                                                  The hex digits from the keyid
Have fun!

PS The finger requests to this server are *NOT* logged.
(At least by us.  Who knows what the NSA is up to :-) )

@_subject: Someone yanking your chain? (rather than LD`s account...) 
Hey, maybe its just me, but when I saw "Steve Dempsey"s first
mail to cypherpunks come time ago where he represented himself
as Lance`s postmaster, I thought "funny, this guy writes just
like Detweiler when Detweiler is acting sane..."
So Dempsey has now said that he`s chopped LD`s account...Hmmm...
How come this was posted today?
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
I also notice while you were all wondering where LD could still
be getting his cypherpunks feed from, Dempsey had become a subscriber to
the list.  (You guys really should block that EXPN command you know...it`s
been mentioned often enough...)

@_subject: Update to finger keyserver at wasabi.io.com 
Following suggestions on the net, the wasabi.io.com keyserver has been
upgraded to allow arbitrary comments to be attached to public keys in
the archive.  This is primarily for the benefit of people who lost their
master keyring and had not prepared a revocation certificate in advance.
For an example of how this might be used, try
   finger 0x445051
   finger 0xbdfe4d
As you see, the key is still returned.  It is up to you to read the
attached comments and to decide not to use the key.  This  solution to
the lost key problem was chosen in order to prevent a denial of service
attack on the keyservers.
Anyone who wishes their key to be revoked in this way, please post
publicly to alt.security.pgp

@_subject: Want to run a pgp key server? 
The new pgp keyserver code which was being tested at wasabi.io.com for a few
months seems to be fairly stable.  If anyone else is interested in running
a server like this, the sources are available from wasabi's ftp area:
It's not particularly intelligently packaged for ease of installation,
so anyone who wants to try it should be reasonably fluent with C and
used to porting packages from system to system.  At the moment it's only
known to work for sure on BSDI unix.
In the tar file you'll also find 'procmail', and some perl scripts
for doing ftp mirroring.
You'll need about 6Mb free in total while installing.
Keeping your server running will involve about 3Mb of daily ftp updates,
so you probably don't want to run this from a dial-up site :-)
This server does *not* use pgp at all, so you ought to be safe from
hassles from PKP.  Just remember, you're *publishing* information...
Mail me at this address if you try to install it, please.

@_subject: KEYSERVER UPGRADE ANNOUNCEMENT 
The keyserver at wasabi.io.com has been upgraded to cover the
new format of pgp2.5 output and its 8 character Key IDs.  It will
continue to serve keys requested by 6 character ID for a short
while, but the 6 character key database will not be refreshed
with new keys.  After a week or two we will remove the old data
and all requests must be for 8 character Key IDs.
If you have a reference to your key at wasabi in your .signature,
please find the longer form of your key ID and update your
sig file.
Thank you.
The Mgt.
