Secure HTTP ist the HTTP protocol based on SSL sockets. You may choose any
server you like or which fits your needs (database connections, ...). There
are not so many cryptographic failtures a developer can do. Keep you hands
away from servers only supporting exportable protocols.
Ask you next Certification Authority for help, they must support your server
software. (we do run one ;->)
