  Yep - A shame about being anonymous...because it was succinctly put -   but explanations to Steve Orr unnecessary - surely? Nevertheless, I'm

As a _very_ low profile member of this list I thought a futile gesture
was needed at this point:
                        *I agree with you*
I've been trying to interest the  BBC in the U.K. in pgp, clipper et al for ages - I give up!.- BTW- after 'Britland' MPs posted hear a while back
I thought _maybe_ we'd hear more.Will the last one to leave Grate Britain
please switch out the lights!

I think it was around March '95. Adam Back(?) cross-posted an email
from sci.crypt (written by Chris Smith and concerning Cambridge(U.K.)
MP Anne Campbell).At some point Campbell posted to the list herself(?)
Sorry,I'm not very clear on this but for some reason I always thought
she wasn't the only MP involved. Yadayadayada... they're a bit like London buses-
nothing for hours then 3 or 4 arrive at the same time...
I've posted this to the list 'cause maybe someone can update the story...
I'd _still_ like to know if there has been any discussion(by MPs) since then Sorry about the bandwidth p.s. Weather better now its been sold to the French.
