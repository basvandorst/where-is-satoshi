I have digitized FM radio hiss using a $10 transistor radio feeding

with prominant, periodically spaced noise spikes.  It does not pass Diehard.
But if you take the PARITY of 8 bits to get one bit, then assemble bytes
out of these bits, the results pass Diehard.  This works with 44Khz, 16 bit sampling, with full-volume hiss feeding the

You should probably look for native freeware, no?
Otherwise look in various win archives.
I have not yet done systematic experiments looking at, e.g., entropy in
full-amplitude noise, or intentionally filtering out various pieces
of spectrum.  The tables in RFC 1750 show that 8 bits is reasonable.
Interestingly, the parity of a $10 10year old Radio shack monophonic
FM radio, UNSHIELDED, in a digitally-noisy environment, sampled at 44Khz and 16 bits, passed Diehard.  NB: Consumer computainment devices will include FM/TV receivers very shortly.

The engineering issue is this: no matter how great you filter out the junk, you don't have a perfect analog measurement to start with.
(Note that filtering out junk reduces info content).
So the question is how to distill the bits out of your binary digits.
You need to reduce the number of bits; you need to make them equiprobable.
I have not had luck*time implementing Shannon's method for distilling bits,

On a radio data network: See In this Memorandum we consider something we have earlier referred to as
"poor-boy" microwave. The "poor-boy" designation resulted from an imposed
constraint on the design of an ensemble of microwave communications
equipments--namely, that the designer should have to pay for the system out
of his own pocket! Even so, a look at price tags for anything to do with
any large electronic or communications system would appear to render the
term "poor-boy" inappropriate. "Mini-cost," a contraction of
"minimum-cost," now seems more fitting.
Mini-cost microwave, therefore, is a minimum-cost, line-of-sight microwave
communications system designed to transmit digital information in as
inexpensive a manner as possible. It is one way of building the links for
the proposed Distributed Adaptive Message Block communications system with
which this series of Memoranda is concerned.
The distributed system itself is designed around digital modulation, using
redundant paths selected on an instant-by-instant basis. The communications
links for such a system can be built in a different manner than their
equivalents in today's systems, taking advantage of the system's less rigid
distortion level and tandem reliability requirements. The fundamental
objective for the system's links is that they permit formation of new
routes cheaply (a necessary survivability criterion), yet allow
transmission on the order of millions of bits per second (see ODC-I,
-VII[1]); system reliability and a low raw error rate are secondary. And,
since future networks conveying military traffic must be designed with the
expectation of heavy damage, powerful digital error detection and error
removal methods have been built into the system.

A *sequence* isn't random; a process is.   A sequence may be the result of
some process, but its always a sample of a process.
When you ask, "Is some process random", you *must* define "random"
operationally, thus, finitely.
A test for structure, such as Marsaglia's "Diehard" suite, measures various statistics (structure) of a sample and compares
them to the measurements you'd get for (abstractly modelled, "real")
randomness.  If the particular tests you've chosen don't see some structure that's present in the sample, you'll mistakenly accept the process as "random".  Diehard is nice because it includes
complex stats and some Monte Carlo evaluations.
Marsaglia's test was designed to find problems in PRNGs, which he was
working on.
Maurer suggests a way to compute the entropy of the data, taken as N-bit
blocks, and computes the value you'd compute for random data.  His test
consumes a lot more data, and is Now, a PRNG has a finite amount of (unknown) initial internal state.
This state is expanded into the output stream, which goes on forever,
thus the finite initial entropy is spread infinitestimally thin.
A true RNG, even an imperfect one, generates a constant amount of entropy
per symbol ("bit per baud" averaged over any sufficiently large window).

@_subject: bug in my Maurer code; retraction of claim; ref 
There was a numerical bug in the C code for Maurer's Univ. Stat. Test
for Randomness which I posted.  The "float" variable "Sum" should be "double".  This will cause an incorrect input-size dependence
for large >40Mbyte files.
Measuring (with the fixed version) the output of a block cipher in feedback
mode, I find that it DOES NOT differ from truly nondeterministic noise, as
I had claimed.  The difference I had observed was due to a larger sample
size for my cipher-noise.  Boy do I feel stupid.
Needless to say, sorry about any inconvenience.
The fixed code follows at the bottom.  This version also spits out
an early estimate after a million samples; this turns out to be
very close to the final value for (homogenous) large samples.
I recently found the following amendment to Maurer's work
at Abstract. Maurer's universal test is a very common randomness test, capable
of detecting a wide gamut of statistical defects. The algorithm is simple
(a few Java code lines), flexible (a variety of parameter combinations can
be chosen by the tester) and fast.
Although the test is based on sound probabilistic grounds, one of its
crucial parts uses the heuristic approximation:
c(L,K) = 0.7 - 0.8/L + (1.6 + 12.8/L)K-4/L
In this work we compute the precise value of c(L,K) and show that the
inaccuracy due to the heuristic estimate can make the test 2.67 times more
permissive than what is theoretically admitted.
Moreover, we etablish a new asymptotic relation between the test parameter
and the source's entropy.
