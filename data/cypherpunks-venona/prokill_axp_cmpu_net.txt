Roach Exterminator Kills Waterbugs, Silverfish, and Ants. Where they travel and in
their nests. Is an oderless white powder. This formula was proven to be 100% effective against Cockroaches and Waterbugs by the University of California over 30 years ago. Supplied in 4 oz. containers, enough to treat several average houses. The sprays all really useless when compared to this product. The ULTIMATE goal is to eliminate roaches
completely, but sprays just don't kill the cockroaches' eggs.
