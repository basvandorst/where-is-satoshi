Just one thing about the names of the different lists:
I received a mail listing the changes to come.
It was very easy to understand that I am going to get the moderated list
if I do not change my subscription.I'll find out if I will miss something.
We'll see.
I wonder who is so brainless, not to understand what's going on.
Do you really think the subscribers are pure Idiots?

@_subject: MagicMoney 
I finally got a copy of MagicMoney (from ftp://utopia.hacktic.nl).
It is just the code (compiling without error), but there is no README or
documentation at all.Can someone give me a hint,what to do with this
package? Is there a documentation somesite?
BTW utopia is the site,you can get all the export restricted stuff outside
the US.

This is a real problem to me. As I recieve mail via cslip using
popclient there seems to be no way to get it sorted. Though I'm not a
programmer at all I could instruct procmail to do what I want. It works
fine when I'm sending mail from one account to the other locally. You can
find information on procmail on the net (and this list). But nobody seems
to know about popclient, which according to the man-pages may be
influenced by an awk-script to do sorting.
Does anybody know about an example script on that? An URL?
Not that I know about awk. But you can't do anything w/o trying.

@_subject: Serious bug in Cyrix.IBM,SGS 6x86 CPU 
There is an article in the latest c't computer magazin about a bug
called 'Hidden CLI' in all the 6x86 CPUs including M2.
As I do not have access to such a CPU I can't verify it.
The code:
          MOV BX,70h
          STI
again:    XCHG AX,[BX]
          MOV DX,AX
          JMP again
The CPU hangs ignoring all interrupts.
Anybody heard about it?

Installed Junkbuster yesterday with a blocklist that seems to work o.k.
Just a silly? question on cookies:
What will happen if I just link cookies.txt to /dev/null ?
Is there anything speaking against this solution?
