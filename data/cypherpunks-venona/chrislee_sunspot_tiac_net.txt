@_subject: PGP/Unix scripts, mail proggies? 
Hello all,
simple way to encrypt/decrypt e-mail with PGP in a Linux(Unix)
enviroment...?  Sorry if this has been answered a thousand times, but it
would really make PGP a more viable option with my small ISP.
Thank you very much for any answers, please reply to me personally.

PS Please don't suggest any Windows programs, excluding X-Windows of
course.  :)
