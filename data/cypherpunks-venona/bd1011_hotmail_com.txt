GCC(Gao's Chaos Cryptosystem)
GCC uses the newest chaos logic and is conventional cryptosystem stream encryption. It is high speed and allows variable-length keys, making it reliable and suitable for use in multimedia.
Chaos InforGuard
GCC(Gao's Chaos Cryptosystem) security application.
High speed,variable-length keys,high reliability,and user friendliness allow you
to easily encrypt an entire harddisc.Can be used with Windows3.1 & Internet Mailer Using Gao's Chaos Cryptosystem
Chaos-mail is a cryptosystem mailer for use on Windows95,which using GCC and Chaos
MAM, gives you the ability to encrypt/decrypt and verify mail. Chaos-mail is a
cryptosystem mailer for user on Windows 95 which, using GCC and Chaos MAM, gives
you the ability to encrypt, decrypt, and verify mail. Not only is it reliable, and user-friendly, but it is also very suitable for multimedia of its non-biased treatment of data.

@_subject: MISTY encryption 
Misty is a cryptographic algorithm developed by Mitsubishi Electric after they broke DES in 1994.It is designed to withstand linear
and differential cryptanalysis, but has not yet been cryptanalysed.
As it has not undergoneintensive peer review, the usual caution is recommended. It is being considered for inclusion into the SET 2.0 standard.

@_subject: about MISTY encryption algorithm 
itsubishi Electric Corp. has developed new secret-key cryptosystem MISTY1 and MISTY2, which are ciphers with
128-bit key and 64-bit data block. They are provably secure against differential and linear cryptanalysis,
and also fast on software implementations as well as on hardware platforms. Using ciphers on wide-area
networks requires a method to maintain security as long as its encryption key (password commonly shared by a
sender and a receiver) is kept secret, even if the mechanism of the encryption is made public. However,
possibilities of unauthorized access will increase when the encryption mechanism is made public. In fact,
several encryption algorithms, whose specifications were made public, have been compelled to make
specification changes, and to sacrifice their encryption speed in return for an increased cipher strength to
protect against recent decoding methods. This is why an encryption system whose security against these
decoding method is strictly evaluated at the design stage has become necessary. Since announcing its linear
cryptanalysis, Mitsubishi Electric has been making efforts to develop encryption technology backed by
adequate security. In January 1994, Mitsubishi Electric performed the first successful experiment to decode
the Data Encryption Standard (DES), an American standard commercial encryption system, to quantitatively
evaluate its strength using this linear cryptanalysis. Using this evaluation technology, Mitsubishi Electric
has developed an encryption algorithm that provides sufficient security and achieves high speed encryption. Get Your Private, Free Email at

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) announced today the development of           Efficient Probabilistic Public-Key Encryption (EPOC), a highly secure and mathematically           verified public-key encryption scheme that encrypts information on the transmission side           with a public-key (encryption key) and then decrypts it on the receiver side with a secret
          -key (decryption key).
          Encryption technology has become necessary to prevent information on the Internet from           being monitored by others without authorization. Public-key encryption is being widely           researched as a practical means of encrypting communication for security.
          The paramount feature of any public-key encryption schemes is ensuring that figuring out           the decryption key from the encryption key is as difficult as possible, to prevent           unauthorized use of ciphered information. The RSA*1 scheme uses factoring and the elliptic           curve encryption scheme*2 uses elliptic curve discrete logarithms, both of which can take           a supercomputer a very long time to determine the key. It has not been verified, however,           that either scheme provides the necessary security to prevent ciphered information from           being broken by a method other than factoring or elliptic curve discrete logarithms. The           Rabin encryption scheme*3, which also uses factoring, offers no algorithm other than           factoring for computing the complete plain-text, but it has not been proven that any bit           of plain-text cannot be computed.
          EPOC is a practical scheme in that the computer computation workload for encrypting and           decrypting is about the same as that for the RSA and elliptic curve encryption schemes.           Also, EPOC is a highly secure scheme which uses a trapdoor discrete logarithm*4  as the           key mathematical technique and can be broken only by factoring. Factoring is difficult           to accomplish, even with a supercomputer, and the probability that an efficient solution           to factoring will be found soon is very low, because mathematicians have been studying           the problem for years. EPOC ensures that partial, as well as whole, texts cannot be broken.           Finally, EPOC uses probabilistic encryption, so re-encrypted text is encrypted differently           each time, unlike the Rabin and RSA scheme, which use deterministic encryption.
          NTT now plans to incorporate EPOC in systems for enhanced security on the Internet.           Public-key encryption is used primarily for key distribution, because computation load is           greater than that for secret-key encryption*5, so EPOC will be used in existing encryption           modules for key distribution.
          Other applications will also be developed. In particular, EPOC is suitable for electronic           voting and anonymous telecommunication since it has a homomorphic property, unlike the RSA,           Rabin and elliptic curve encryption schemes. The theoretical details will be presented at           Eurocrypt '98 in Finland this June.           Notes:            *1: The RSA scheme was developed by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman in 1978 and is based on           the difficulty of factoring. It was the first public-key encryption scheme.
          *2: The elliptic curve encryption scheme was proposed independently by Miller and Koblitz           in 1985 and is based on the difficulty of elliptic curve discrete logarithms. The basic           technique is based on a scheme developed by Diffie and Hellman in 1976.
          *3: The Rabin scheme was developed by Rabin in 1979 and is based on the difficulty of           factoring. It was the first public-key encryption scheme to verify the impossibility of           breaking a complete text without factoring the public-key.
          *4: A trapdoor discrete logarithm is a newly discovered discrete logarithm problem that           can be solved only if a secret-key is known.
          *5: Secret-key encryption differs from public-key encryption in that the sender and the           receiver use the same key for encryption and decryption.
