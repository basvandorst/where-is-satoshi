@_subject: Anonymous Remailers 
First, I'd like to announce that I am running a new remailer.  The
address is ghio  It supports the standard cypherpunks
headers/format, including the  pasting header.  It also has a 'fuzzy
matching' routine, that should be able to accept all reasonable
variations of Anon-To and Remail-To.  Upper/lower case is unimportant.
No PGP yet, but I should have that done soon.
Second, I want to ask why everyone else's remailers keep disappearing???
We've recently lost three: remail remailer
and ebrandt  Dis.org made no announcement of the
remailer going down, it just disappeared.
Finally, I have set up an automatic remailer ping system on my account
at CMU.  Finger ghio to see the list.  It lists the
address of each remailer, the date and time of the last ping message
that it responded to, and how long (in hours, minutes, and seconds) that
it took to receive the response.

Generally, as much as you can fit on the line.  If you're running out
of space in your particular mail editor, try using "Anon-To:" instead.
If you mean chaining remailers, then yes.  If you mean the ability
to send to multiple recipients, then no.  Most remailers don't
allow multiple recipients.  This is due to our friend Detweiler
who likes to experiment with exponential growth phenomena.
Obviously you have not read my info file on the remailers.
Finger remailer-list or send mail to
mg5n+remailers   It lists many mail-to-usenet
gateways which will accept dots.
When headers follow a  token, they are simply added into the
output file without any processing.  Headers following the ::
token are processed as commands in normal headers.
This seems to have caused some confusion with respect to the
treated as if it were a normal header, and passed thru to the
outgoing message.  A subject can also be added (like any other header)
following the  token.  However, if you have a subject line in
the headers, and another following the  token, the original subject
gets passed thru, and the second one then gets appended, resulting
in both Subject lines being present in the output file.
My remailer (ghio will strip out a blank subject line,
so that you can insert one with the  if you wish.  I think
Hal Finney's remailer is set up the same way.  Chael Hall's remailers
(bsu.edu) always remove the subject line, so you must insert it
with the  header if you want one.
I think it can be done...

I've had a lot of people make mistakes when using my remailer.  Maybe this
is common to happen to most people who run remailers, but the large number
of mistakes surprised me.  To eliminate the clutter in my inbox, I
modified my remailer to check the first line of the message for an Anon-To:
or Request-Remailing-To: header, in case the person forgot the double colon.
If the first line is blank, it checks the second.  This seems to have taken
care of most of the problems.
But somehow, someone figured out how to defeat my efforts and mess up anyway:
They began with the header Encrypted: PGP and then followed it with an
unencrypted message...

Yes.  If you use only one remailer, and that remailer keeps logs, then it
makes it trivial for the remailer operator to find out who sent the message.
If you chain remailers, then it makes it more difficult to trace it back,
but the first remailer can see the source and destination, which means someone
could find out if they looked.  However, if you chain and use PGP, it requires
the cooperation of all remailer operators involved.  If someone really tried to
get a lot of remailer operators to cooperate in tracing a message, someone's
going to make a stink about it.
Now there is the traffic analysis problem, and the time-correlation problem.
This can be solved by using the slower (UUCP) remailers.
"How much is enough" is something you must decide for yourself.
BTW: Which remailers keep logs?  Mine does...  I think Chael Hall and Hal
Finney do.  And catalyst doesn't (or didn't awhile ago).  What about the rest?

I added a reorder and delay feature to my remailer Here's how to use it.  Add a header Latent-Time: with the time (in HH:MM:SS
format).  You must 24 hour time, no AM/PM accepted.  The seconds are optional
and may be omitted.  Example:
You can also have it delayed a certain amount of time.  To do this, put a plus
before the time.  Example:
Random reordering is possible by adding r to the time.
The longest delay time possible is 24 hours.  Don't expect on the minute
delivery - there are many things beyond my control which can delay mail.
"Anon-To" and "Latent-Time" do not need to go in the body of the message;
they may be placed in the headers if your mailer supports it.

@_subject: Re: Prime magnitude and keys...a ? 
Okay, obviously neither you or Perry know what you're talking about, or
you are too busy flaming each other to express your thoughts coherently.
Finding the secret key WILL allow you to factor the modulus (assuming you
know the public key).  Therefore, solving for the secret exponent is
equivilent to factoring.  This has been discussed before.  I thought you
have been on the list long enuff to remember it, but it is obviously
necessary to restate the explanation for those who haven't seen it before.
Assume we have:  Two (unknown) prime numbers p and q, a known modulus n,
where n is the product of p and q, and known public key exponent e.  Now,
suppose someone discovers the corresponding secret key d.
Now assuming the case where de=(p-1)(q-1)+1, we have two equations with two
  pq = n
  de = (p-1)(q-1) + 1
Solving for p and q is simply a matter of solving simeltaneous equations.
First, we rewrite the second equation:
  de = pq - p - q + 2
Now we substitute the known values for de and pq and do some simple algebra:
  p = n - de + 2 - q
Substitute p in the original equation:
  q(n-de+2-q) = n
  q(n-de+2) - qq = n
  -qq + q(n-de+2) - n = 0
  qq - q(n-de+2) + n = 0
Now solve for q using the quadratic formula.
  q=((n-de+2)+((n-de+2)^2-4)^(.5))/2
P can then be found (of course) by dividing n by the now-known value for q.
Now, there is the possibility that (p-1)(q-1)+1 will not equal d*e.  However,
d*e will always be equal to k(p-1)(q-1)+1 where k is an interger.  Given
PGP's fondness for using 17 for d, and since e < (p-1)(q-1) then
de < 17(p-1)(q-1), therefore k<17.  It would therefore be fairly easy to find
k, since it could only be one of sixteen possible values.
Furthermore, (and more importantly), it is not necessary to know the prime
factorization to generate key pairs.  It is only necessary to know a valid
number of the form k(p-1)(q-1).  You can find an inverse key for any public
key just by finding its multiplicative inverse modulo k(p-1)(q-1)
(k, p, & q do not need to be known.)  Therefore, if you find one keypair,
you can find them all.

@_subject: REMAIL: Remailer that only remails to other remailers 
One of the problems in convincing people to run remailers is that they don't
want to have to deal with complaints.  Someone posted awhile ago that they
would be willing to run a remailer that would only remail to other remailers.
This would enhance the security of remailer chains while not creating too
many political problems for sensitive sysadmins.  If anyone's still
interested, here's how to do it:
ftp cs.cmu.edu
cd /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr12/mg5n/public
get ghio.cp.remailer.tar.gz
This is a copy of the remailer that I run on kaiwan.  gunzip and untar it.
Modify remailer and sendlatents with the proper directory names for your
system.  Now, you need to modify a line at the end of block.c.  Change
  if (match==0) printf("%s",argv[1]);
  if (match!=0) printf("%s",argv[1]);
Now it is a pass-address filter instead of a block-address filter.
Now put the addresses that you want the remailer to be able to send to in
blocked.addresses (you can rename the file in the remailer csh script.)
Now create a PGP key for your remailer, set up a .forward file to 'remailer'
and you're all set...

Hmm.. This is interesting indeed.  It is a 32-round cipher operating
on a 64-bit block.  It has an 80-bit key with a 16-bit cryptographic
checkword.  This seems a lot like a certain hardware-based encryption
system some TLA spooks were pushing about a year ago.
If this isn't Skipjack, someone sure went to a lot of trouble to make
it look like skipjack.  It's also possible that it is an early development
version of what later became Skipjack/Clipper.  It is dated February 1989
and July 1991, which would be consistent with NSA's claim that they had
been working on Skipjack for about 5 years.  It also mentions a "S-2"
revision.  It'd be interesting to try to see if it will interoperate with
a real clipper chip, but I wouldn't bet on it.
Hal Finney noticed that the coding style seems sloppy or amateurish.
This is probably just an attempt by the programmer to hide his tracks.
The RC4 stuff also had unnecessary operations in it, presumably for the
same reason.
Hal also comments on the use of XOR instead of bit permutations as in
DES, and the use of 8-bit table sizes, which would make a software
implementation easier.  This is odd, considering that the algorithm
purports to be designed for hardware.  However, NSA did say that part
of the clipper algorithm was in software, which was designed to be
erased if the chip was tampered with...

If one is motivated enough to want source code to their operating system,
then they are motivated enough to dump Windows and download Linux or BSD.
The only reason to reverse-engineer Windows 95 is to produce applications
which are able to interoperate with Windows software in an unintended
manner, and the only reason to want to do this (instead of writing a
version for an open platform) is because Windows is standard on many PCs.
The same applies to GAK.  There is no reason to hack it when you can just
use PGP instead.  The only reason to hack it would be if it became a
standard.  If we have to start hacking GAK applications, we've already
lost to a degree.  Thus our focus should be on making alternatives
available instead of just attacking GAK.  (Although I suppose you could
