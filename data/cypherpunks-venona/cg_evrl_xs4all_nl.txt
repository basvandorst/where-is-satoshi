In the Netherlands, every house is hooked to the natural gas network. I've
heard rumours about them guys testing literally blowing fiber into your
house through the gas pipes (hook fiber to a shuttle, let it loose - gas
pressure does the rest). Never heard how they're gonna do the steering on
junctions, though...
Welcome to the brave new world - I envision utility companies literally
running down your front door for the privilege of being allowed to hook
your house to their 10Gbps network :-)
