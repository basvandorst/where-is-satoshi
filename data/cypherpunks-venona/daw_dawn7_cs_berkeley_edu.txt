[ ... 1/4 of a cycle of RC2: ... ]

A little bit.
Hrmm, I'm not convinced that it's so hard to build a linear characteristic;
there are plenty of 1/4-cycle characteristics that don't spread out very
much.  The problem is that I can't find any approximations with high enough
bias to be useful.
So here's some information on the (useless) linear characteristics I've been
thinking about; maybe this will prompt some clever improvement from someone
else.  They're all based on two observations: first, the addition operation
has linear characteristics of the form
and second, the bit-multiplexing function
has linear characteristics of the form
(A note on notation: X[i] denotes the i-th bit of X, and
X[i,j,k] = X[i] + X[j] + X[k].  If an approximation holds with probability
p, then I say it has bias b = 2 |p - 1/2|; note that adding two approximations
multiplies their biases, and that one needs about 1/b^2 known plaintexts
to take advantage of a linear characteristic for the whole cipher.  Next,
let K denote the 1/4-cycle subkey, and let A' denote the new value of A
after the 1/4-cycle is applied to it.  Also, + denotes xor in approximations.
By 1/4-cycle, I mean something of the form A = rotl(A + f(B,C,D) + K, 1);
so RC2 has 16 full cycles, and each full cycle has 4 1/4-cycles.)
Now given those building blocks for linear characteristics, you can combine
them to get various linear characteristics for 1/4 of a cycle, like this:
These don't spread out too well; I haven't completely worked out how to
do many-cycle linear approximations, but I think they shouldn't be too hard
to find.  (For instance, keep only A and C active, or somesuch.)
The real stumbling block is the lack of high-bias linear approximations for
a 1/4-cycle, not the difficulty of combining them, IMHO.  For instance, if
you supposed that there was just one 1/8-bias linear approximation active
in each full cycle, we get a total bias over 16 cycles of 2^{-48}, which
would imply something like 2^{96} known plaintexts for a linear attack.
This is an overly optimistic estimate, since any full 16-cycle linear
characteristic which I can imagine will probably require more than one
linear approximation per cycle.  (It also ignores the non-iterative rounds;
but I think they'll be easy to deal with if you can handle everything else.)
What makes the 1/4-cycle linear approximations have such a low bias is RC2's
extensive use of addition mod 2^32 instead of bitwise xor.
So anyhow, the final word is that I don't see how to do linear cryptanalysis
of RC2, but maybe someone else will have some insights.
P.S. There is an analogue of differential cryptanalysis where we consider the
difference measure as addition mod 2^32 instead of bitwise xor.  Is there
a similar generalization of linear cryptanalysis?  I don't know any, offhand.

In article <199602130139.RAA11162
Hmm, I'd argue that firewall technology would indeed let China filter
out many "subversive" thoughts on the Internet.
The firewall is not going to be able to stop the two-rogue problem:
two technically knowledgeable rogue agents, one on each side of the
firewall, *will* succeed in communicating dangerous thoughts if they
try hard enough.  But that's not so important to solve perfectly,
in practice.
No, in reality, China could set up a few simple application proxies
and only allow world -> China traffic on a few closely controlled
ports, such as http, smtp, nntp, ftp, etc.  The proxies could
* filter out "naughty" and "seditious" sites (e.g. * filter out email, news, etc. which has traversed
  a "known dangerous site" (e.g. a remailer or ftp.hacktic.nl),
* daily update their lists of subversive sites
  (e.g. by reading Raph's remailer list),
* filter out indecent newsgroups,
* do simple keyword searches (e.g. fuck, revolution, protest, crypto),
  and/or
* do simple content analysis
  (e.g. maybe filter out .gifs, to stop nude pics).
This would hose 93% of the subversive stuff on the 'net.
"Social solutions" (read: men with guns) can eliminate the last 7%.
And so it goes.
Sure, someone in the "free world" (e.g. not China or the USA) could run
a remailer / http-proxy at a new site each day, enabling someone knowledgeable
in China to find dangerous material.  But the fact remains that this
requires technical knowledge and the willingness to go to the trouble of
actively accessing the remailer site.
Again, someone in the China could run a remailer / reposter / http-proxy
themselves inside the firewall; that's where the "social solutions" come in.
Kick down the door (see, jackboots are good for something after all!), beat
up the children, and you can kiss that remailer goodbye.
Technically, you're right in saying that you can't filter all the content
perfectly; it's the classic covert channel problem.  But practically, the
Chinese gov't can probably wreak havoc with 'net freedom in China.
