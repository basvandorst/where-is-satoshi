Two teens reported being propositioned, outside the neighborhood skating rink, to participate in the making of some kiddie porn.  They called police who made some arrests (I think).
The city council is considering legislation to outlaw skating rinks.

Notably, the emphasis is on the needs of business, not "people."
We are in an excellent position to observe and document the process whereby
"business" -- that is, organizations motivated primarily, if not exclusively,
by the desire for short-term profits accruing to vested interests -- comes
to dominate and control a technology.  The auto and television industries come
to mind as two prior examples.  We are about to see the net go the same way.
Take notes.

                      Even so, privacy activists remained
                      disappointed with many of the document's
                      features. "This isn't anything new," said David
                      Banisar, counsel to the Electronic Privacy and
                      Information Center. "The privacy stuff is
                      terrible. They say it's market driven, but
                      markets don't work with privacy. It's like what
                      happened with P-Trak."

Well, then, tanslation:
"I say SSLEAY is not secure - but to actually do the homework
to back my assertion then someone has to pay me."
Hmmmph.  Not very useful.  Nor credible.

I would say that depends on -where- &/or -how- you store the premaster/master,
and is dependent on platform threat models rather than attacks on the wire.  These are different problem spaces with different solutions, which some
changes to SSL may help address: some tweaks may be useful to support more
secure secret management on the platforms.  But I would not go so far as to
that these issues make SSL or an implementation insecure per-se, until I
did the
complete job.  If my platform is compromised such that the master or premaster secret
can be subverted, then I have problems that go way deeper than SSL or a
implementation of it.
Would you like to propose some fixes?  We would be very interested.
