A simple substitution cypher has a keyspace of
26! ~ 2**88
Isn't this too strong to export?

I caught the Headline News mention of the DES crack and it
unfortunately put the wrong spin on things.
I can't remember it word for word, but it went like this:
"If you're going to decrypt financial transactions you'd better
be prepared to get 1000 computers and spend 3 months on
the project."
The report was delivered with a hint of a smile, as if to suggest
that the time and resources might have been better spent.
