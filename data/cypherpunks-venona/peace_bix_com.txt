  I think the idea of a standard user configurable crypto-engine
is a good one..that way people could choose (and upgrade) algorythms..
sort of like modern DSP based highspeed modems..(It could also have a socket
for ROM based firmware cartridges..(RSA,IDEA,etc..) and a magstripe reader and keyboard for key entry..(This would make trading keys easy..)
ViaCrypt now sells three versions of a security module, one on a dongle
for a parallel port, another on a serial port, that can do all the
interesting crypto algorithms of the day. And all are fully licensed.

This is a comment to message 694.
I think many of us want to know anything that happens. (About the Zimmermann
Grand Jury).   If Phil Zimmermann
is indicted for what he did, then I can't see how the US can differ from
any third-world police state. I can remember reading about how 'Fusion'
magazine, which is a publication dealing with Nuclear Fusion, was prosecuted
for allegedly revealing secrets behind the construction of thermonuclear
weapons (amazingly, one of the key techniques was the use of Styrofoam to
build a stable plasma during detonation). They pointed out that the details
had been published 30 years ago in the Encyclopedia Americana. I believe
the case was dropped. Phil didn't invent RSA encryption. He just popularised it by providing a
great product, professionally designed and written, easy to use.
To attempt to suppress this technology now would be as futile as suppressing
details on the construction of nuclear weapons. Enough information exists
in the public domain for countries such as North Korea to build a bomb.
You can't, as one science-fiction writer said in another context,
"put the mushroom cloud back in the shiny uranium sphere". Actually, now
I think about that, it was Isaac Asimov in his story about an invention
which allowed people to see back into time. Suppressed by the Government,
it was independently re-invented by a professor who only got curious about
the topic when he realised it was classified. The catch; when does time begin?
one second ago?, one nano-second ago?. With the invention, privacy became
a thing of the past; you could go anywhere, see anything. Its kind of a neat
twist on this issue. The government would have us believe encryption is a
*bad thing* because bad guys will use it to hide their activities. But,like
the time-travel machine, there are good and bad points. Who do you believe?.
Myself, I want to use encryption such as PGP for good and legitimate reasons.
For example, if I want to send confidential information over the Internet, which
is obviously not a secure channel. It is patently ridiculous to suggest
that I should not be permitted to do this.
But the arguments have been done to death. Like abortion, it boils down to
the right of the individual versus the rights of the State (and by implication,
society as a whole). I vote for the right to privacy. In fact, I had thought
it enshrined in the Constitution. It is a basic tenet of life in a democratic
If you're reading this, Phil, there are many people backing you 100%.
As for the rest of us, make a stand. To the owners of BIX, if you permit
these sorts of discussions on your system, you should have the courage to post
PGP. There are other US sites on the Internet still holding it. Stand up and
be counted!. They can't sue you all.

Well now, I do that for a living.  It isn't exactly cheap.  The phone

Fellow cryptorians:
The following is a draft of a paper that describes a mode of
operation that I personally feel is useful for bulk data
encryption for PEM, RIPEM, EDI, PGP and any other secure email
application.  In particular, submode CC1 is proposed for these
applications.  I would welcome any suggestions that would help in
evaluating this method in those venues.

              Cipher-Chain-Cipher Mode of Operation
           for Improving the Security of Block Ciphers
                       by Thomas C. Jones
1 ABSTRACT
As a way to extend the usefulness of encryption with the DES and
prevent several of the more common attacks on the DES, a new mode
of operation is defined that can be used with any block cipher,
including DES.  This mode of operation performs a cipher
operation both before and after a chaining operation and so could
be called cipher-chain-cipher (CCC) mode of operation.  It is
characterized by never performing any operation with the
plaintext data except immediately after one cipher operation and
immediately prior to another, so that cipher operations separate
the plaintext and ciphertext in both directions.  Thus the common
known-text attack and chosen-text attack are avoided and, for
some implementations, only two DES operations are required per
plaintext block.
2 BACKGROUND
Existing block encryption algorithms, such as the Data Encryption
Standard (FIPS 46) have reached the end of their useful life.  It
was expected when the DES was first issued in 1976 that it would
be used for 5 to 10 years.  It is a tribute the care with which
this algorithm was constructed, that it is only now yielding to
practical cryptanalysis.  In particular, the 56 bit key used with
the DES can be determined by brute force attack using specially
designed hardware operating in parallel.
In practical applications of the DES, there are a wide range of
ways to combine the input plaintext with the DES algorithm to
produce an output ciphertext.  In order to promote
interoperability and good cryptographic practice the NIST issued
"Modes of Operation of the DES" as FIPS 81.  The most popular of
the modes of operation for bulk plaintext data to be encrypted is
Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).
Several candidate algorithms have been offered as a replacement
for the DES, but the large installed base of DES hardware and
industry expertise in applying the DES have worked against the
adoption of any of these candidates.  Experience has shown that
untested cryptographic algorithms are likely to have
unanticipated security weaknesses.  This also works against the
adoption of new algorithms.
When the bankers were looking for a stronger algorithm than the
DES for protection of cryptographic keying material, they chose
to leave the underlying DES algorithm in place, but apply the
algorithm three separate times to the input plaintext to yield a
"super-encrypted" output ciphertext.  This has been considered to
be a special mode of operation known as EDE (for encrypt-decrypt-
encrypt) with 2 independent 56 bit keys.  The reason that three
were chosen, rather than two, relates to a particular
cryptanalytic attack called "meet in the middle" where the
cryptanalyst starts exhaustive first stage encryption of
plaintext simultaneously with exhaustive second stage decryption
of ciphertext and comparing the resulting values.  While the
computer storage required for this attack is impractical today,
the theoretical existence of the attack discourages double DES
modes of operation.
It is well known that the redundancy of common data streams, such
as the English language, results in ciphertext that can be
decrypted to only one plaintext that is realistically English. The amount of ciphertext that is needed to have some assurance
that only a single plaintext interpretation is known as the
"unicity distance".  For DES and English the unicity distance is
slightly longer that one 8 byte block.  This means that if the
language was known to be English, only two blocks of ciphertext
would be required to have a high degree of confidence that any
decryption that yielded English text would be the only decryption
that would do so.  Even more to the point, if a computer could
quickly assess the likelihood that a decryption of a single
ciphertext block looked like English, only a single additional
decryption would be required to verify that.  This would make an
attack, that tested every one of the possible keys, likely to
succeed.  The only thing that has prevented such a "brute force"
attack has been the time and effort to perform such an attack. That sort of brute force attack is now within the grasp of well-
financed commercial enterprises, not to mention secret
governmental agencies.
Several cryptanalytic attacks have been mounted on the DES to
find some simpler way than brute force to recover the key given
the output ciphertext and some other information.  Most of these
attacks rely on access to a large amount of plaintext and the
corresponding ciphertext, this is called a "known plaintext
attack".  Existing modes of operation do not significantly reduce
the threat of a known plaintext attack.  Several methods are
already known to reduce the threat of this attack, principle
among them is restricting the use of each DES key to a single
document or interchange.  That is the method recommended here.
If the cryptanalyst has access to the cryptographic engine with
the key loaded, then two other attacks are possible.  The "chosen
plaintext attack" relies on the analysis of the underlying
structure of the block algorithm by feeding it special
combinations of bits that test particular functional
characteristics of that structure.  "Differential cryptanalysis"
is an attack that relies on changing single bits in the plaintext
and checking the effect on the ciphertext.  While it seems
unlikely that a user would allow any active DES key to be used in
this way, resistance to these attacks is considered appropriate
in academic circles.
More traditional cryptanalysis relied strictly on redundancy that
could be exploited with access to only the ciphertext itself.  So
far no method of attack on ciphertext has proven to be quicker
than the brute force method mentioned above.  It is up to the
user to employ proven good algorithms in a cryptographically
sound way with secure physical protection of the keying material. It is claimed that the cipher-chain-cipher modes of operation
offer a sound way to extend the life of DES for encrypting bulk
data such as that found in electronic mail systems.
3 SUMMARY
The CCC mode of operation provides a way for input plaintext to
be combined with DES block encryption and chaining from one stage
to another to add an apparently random input component to each
stage.  The essentials of the method is its separation of the
input and the output data at each stage by interposing a cipher
operation between them.  This requires a cipher operation on the
output ciphertext before it is combined with the input plaintext,
as well as a cipher operation on the result of the combining
operation.  Thus the cryptanalyst is not aware of either data
stream that is to be combined with the input plaintext, nor of
the output of the combining of the plaintext with the apparently
random data that is combined with the plaintext.
One reason for combining some apparently random value with the
input plaintext is to provide a means for whitening the input
data; that is, for masking any repeating pattern in the input
plaintext so that the output ciphertext would also fail to
contain any repeating pattern.  It might be possible for some
cryptanalyst to obtain some meaning from the existence of the
repeating pattlue to the receiver.  One good
method is to place all the above values into a single packet that
is encrypted with the receiver's public key component.  The
resulting encrypted packet can then be transmi at least as
good a security level as is available from this mode of operation
with the cryptographic algorithms used for bulk data encryption. The interchange is thus broken into two parts: the first
involving the selection and secure transmittal of the keying
material which is then used in the second part to encrypt the
bulk data according to the modes of operation described in detail
Once the keying material has been generated, the bulk data is
broken into blocks as required by the block cryptographic
algorithm and processed as specified.  The first step is to
optionally cipher the input plaintext using the first key.  The
second step is to chain together this result with apparently
random data feed from the prior step.  The final step is to
cipher the result of the chaining operation and then to transmit
the cipher block created.  The word cipher is used here to mean
either encryption or decryption, since the exact mode that the
block cryptographic algorithm is used at each stage is not
material to the modes of operation described.
4 DESCRIPTION
Other modes of operation, which may have been established by the
Federal Government for other reasons, have not been able to deter
certain types of cryptanalytic attack.  The weakness found in
these other modes is shown, together with the advantages of this
new mode of operation.

        Key     = 56 bit DES single length key
        IV      = 64 bit Initial Value for chaining operation
This shows the Cipher Block Chaining mode of operation of the
DES.  It is very effective at hiding any pattern in the input
plaintext, but does little to deter a cryptanalyst, since if the
input plaintext, and output ciphertext are known, then the input
and output to the cipher operation are known as well.
The fxample of CCC will show how to defeat this sort of
attack by separating the chaining operation from the feedback of
the ciphertext.

The CCC-Encrypt operation consists of DES block encryption of the
ciphertext output from the last stage, an exclusive-or (bit by
bit addition) with the next plaintext input, and a final DES
block decryption to form the next ciphertext output block.  The
initial value (IV) serves as a apparently random input to the
first stage, while the output of each stage serves as a
apparently random input to each stage after the first.  The above
diagram show the first two full stages of encryption.

The CCC-Decrypt operation consists of DES block encryption of the
ciphertext output from the last stage, a DES block encryption of
the cipher text input to the current stage, and an exclusive-or
with the output of both DES block encryptions.  One attack on
this mode is differential cryptanalysis, since, although the
exact value of input to the final cipher stage is not known, a
cryptanalyst that had access to the cryptographic engine with the
key loaded could process plaintext that differed by only a single
bit which would result in only a single bit change in the input
to the final cipher stage.  The cryptanalysis would then be
performed on the ciphertext output. The CCC-encrypt operation can be generalized as shown in the
following diagrams.

The generalized CCC-encrypt operation consists of an initial DES
encrypt operation on the plain text using the first key, followed
by a chaining operation and then a DES decrypt operation on the
result of the chaining operation using the third key.  Several
operations are possible with the chaining operation which uses
the second key.  In all cases the input to the exclusive-or
operation is the result of a variable operation shown above as Op
and the output from the first cipher operation.  The variable
operation in the middle can have one of two sources, and may use
the second key shown in the diagram.        Cipher1       Cipher2

 The generalized CCC-decrypt operation just reverses these
operations, except for the chaining operation, which stays the
same in the encrypt and decrypt operations.
Several submodes are available from this generalized mode of
operation depending on the nature of the operator used between
chaining operations.  Below are listed four submodes that may
have particular interest.
Mode CC0 - This mode does not use Key1, so the first cipher
operation is the identity.  The chaining operation is defined to
be the DES on the feedback from the final cipher operation.  This
is exactly the first example shown above.  Its advantage is that
it uses only two keys and two DES operations per input block. The disadvantages are discussed above.
Mode CC1 - This modeof the exclusive-or operation. This means that the exclusive-or product is just the accumulation
of all the first stage ciphers with the initialization vector. This mode also only uses two independent key values and two DES
operation per input block.  A further advantage is that the
interior chaining operation only uses data that is not available
to the cryptanalyst in either the known-text or the chosen-text
Mode CC2 - This mode is identical to mode CC1 except that the
chaining operation is the DES performed on the result of the
prior exclusive-or.  This mode requires three DES operation per
input block, but gains by confusion of the diffusion entry added
in between each data cipher operation.
Mode CC3 - This mode is identical to mode CC2 except that the
source of the data for the DES operation prior to chaining is not
the prior chaining operation, but feedback from the output stage
of the final cipher operation.  This too requires three DES
operations per input block.
5 EXAMPLE
It will be assumed that the block ciphers of interest all result
in the same amount of output ciphertext as input plaintext with
the possible addition of a fixed length initial value and a
variable length padding to create some optimal length.  In the
DES this optimal data length is any stream that is an exact
multiple of 8 bytes.  Variants of this method could be used with
other block lengths or with byte oriented modes of operation.
While this new mode of operation is expected to find its greatest
use with bulk encryption using data blocks equal in length to the
block length inherent in the underlying block encryption
algorithm, any length block of data could be utilized with any
block length encryption algorithm.  This section shows how bulk
data can be segmented into 64 byte blocks and encrypted using the
64 byte block DES algorithm.  For added security, the secret
keying material and the DES operations are shown to be contained
inside the security perimeter of a cryptographic module which is
mounted inside of a personal computer using a common operating
system.  It would be equally useful to move some, or all, of the
cryptographic operations to code operating under the personal
computer's operation system.
It is critical to the security of the overall system that the
secret keying material, consisting of the two DES keys and the
initial value (IV), be known only to the originating and
receiving party to the interchange.  One way to do this, and to
prevent the accumulation of information for a cryptanalytic
attack on the secret keying material, is to create a new packet
of keying material for each interchange using some suitably
random generator within the security perimeter and encrypt the
entire packet of keying material using this, or some other
encryption method such as the RSA public key encryption method. Using DES as the underlying secret key encryption algorithm may
necessitate other measures when generating the keying material,
such as weak key elimination and key parity generation.
In any case there are two or three DES keys with parity are 64
bits in length.  The initial value is the size of the block which
is also 64 bits.  At least one byte will be used to determine the
exact mode of operation.  Since the first key is optional, the
block of secret data can be constructed as 200 to 264 bits in the
following form:
   +------+----+------+------+----------------+
 mode | IV | Key3 | Key2 | Key1(optional) |
   +------+----+------+------+----------------+
This data is just a valuable as the plaintext of the message to
be protected, since an attacker is assumed to have access to the
ciphertext, so this data will recover the plaintext.  It should
be noted that it is not any more valuable than the plaintext
since it will be used only once to protect one message or
interchange.  Therefore, if the plaintext data is contained on a
personal computer, the enciphering operation can also be
performed on the same personal computer.
On the other hand, the private components of the public key will
be used to decode essentially all the secured messages that are
received over its life, and so its value is the sum of all such
message.  Thus the private components must be protected to a
commensurate level with this value.  Additional means for
protection should include a security perimeter containing these
components together with the operations that are possible with
them.  The security perimeter must be able to physically show
when an attack on the components was made.  Several devices now
have such a security perimeter including: NIST 140-1
cryptographic modules, smart cards with cryptographic co-
processors and PCMCIA cards.
Once suitable keying material is obtained, the originator of the
message may take appropriate means to reduce the redundancy of
the plaintext by compressing it.  Compression, if successful,
always makes the task of the cryptanalyst more difficult by

@_subject: Crypto scripting language 
I wrote a cryptographic scripting language that has been implemented in
a commercial product.  I hesitate to post it here due to its length.
If there is a place to send it where it can be archived for public
down-load, I could do that.  I am in the process of writing it up for
a symposium, but have other things that I would rather do.  If I could
modify it to improve it's integration w/ telescript, I would like to
do it, but I don't have telescript, does anyone here have it?

I have a paper that I am preparing for publication called "Trust
Models" that discusses the difference between PGP & PEM and looks
towards a synthesis of these two models.  Since it is not yet
published, I will only send it to those who agree (1) not to
rebroadcast it, and (2) send me their thoughts on it.

everyone isn't on equal ground in the world.  I personally prefer the
ability to resort to a civil system of litigation than to have some
highly institutionalized, standardized, process that could only be
provided by big government.  At what price equality?
I sometimes find it difficult to agree with Tim May and his anarchist
tendencies, but you, Unicorn, have made me wish for exactly that.  How
can anyone be in favor of big government and crypto privacy.  This makes
you sound like a hypocrite!  It seems that Detwiler, and his tentacles, have performed a valued, if labored, service here.  Anonymity may have
its uses, but it has abuses as well.  It is not the least bit clear from his posting whether Unicorn supports anonymity or not.  Neither is
it clear whether any of the rest of the punks really support anonymity.

I am looking for the source for a Windows front end for PGP.
I know that WINFRONT is available (on special application)
in source, but it's written in Visual Basic.  I guess that
I could get VB and learn it, but I was hoping that someone
knew of a C version.  It doesn't need to be particularly
polished, since I will be making some changes to suit my
own format.  I know its a lot to ask, but I can hope, can't I.
(The path name would help too.)

@_author: ie. live at the EXPENSE of the host 
@_subject: e$ 
I can recall that many years back the casinos in Las Vegas all
accepted the chips from the other ones and then had a great
exchange each day where the accounts were settled up.  Even the
gift shops took chips in place of cash.  The US Treasury put a stop to this as it was considered to be a replacement for cash.
Also I hear a lot about bearer bonds, but never in the US.  OTOH
the NYC subways have started a cash card that they expect merchants
to accept in lieu of coins.  It would be nice to know what the Feds
will or won't accept.  BTW, does it matter if the e$ are US denominated?
Could e$ be presented as travelers checks?  The possibilities here are
extremely interesting.

Bob said> However, it's a stupid parasite which
Not really true.  All parasites kill their host or they would not
be considered parasites (ie. live at the EXPENSE of the host).  The only question is how quickly the host dies.  There is an entire epidemiology of parasitism, ie. which strategies are best for the parasite.  The virulent ones must be able to find a new host quickly, the ones that can't exit quickly rely on the host living for a long time.  There was a good article in SciAm on this a little while back.
Also remember, it is the US Supreme Court which ruled that the
power to tax is the power to destroy.  Sounds like as good a
definition of parasitism as any.

So finding a KeyID is the problem that destroys PGP eh?
Well I would just take that as the problem to solve, not a
reason to throw the baby out with the bath water.
All we need to do is design a distributed, hashed database.
Should be a piece 'o cake, right?
Let's see, first of all the problem is the receiver of a message
who gets just the KeyID.  First of all, the trusted keys should
be expected to be local (in some webby sense).  But lets assume
that the key is new, not in our local cache.  Now my scheme would put
a net of keyservers that ALL know each other.  The local environment
puts in a request to its usual keyserver.  That is the keyserver
that typically has the keys that the receiver is likely to trust.
Now it is certainly possible to imagine a case where a key is not
in the receiver's expected server, so what's next.  Well the keyserver knows ALL the other servers, right, so just copy the
original receiver's request to all the other keyservers.  If that
gets to be too big, just build a real net where every keyserver is
at most two hops away from any other one, then the intermediate
servers that could not honor the request would forward it to all the servers it knew.  I purposely propose that only two steps would
ever be necessary to limit the explosion, but I see that as no
real limitation, the rule could even be modified if there was
really any need.
Hey look, the net supports archie and a host of other non-structured
search mechanisms.  Why create a search hierarchy where such things
are not natural.  Why create a naming hierarchy where such things are
not natural.
By the way, the dockmaster.ncsc.mil note is a good example of a naming
hierarchy that has nothing to do with the employment of the person.
Anyone working in the security field can get an address there.  And
any member can get acm.org or ieee.org. But I can post from any of
there different net addresses which do not even agree at the very
most basic level.  So why would my KeyID be naturally associated with
any one of .net, .org or .com?
