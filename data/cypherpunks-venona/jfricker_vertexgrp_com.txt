@_subject: Anyone know of a white paper on security? 
The question I'm seeking to answer is : What criteria should be used to determine whether a scripting language such as Java, LiveScript, etc. is secure?
There are obvious issues such as access to the file system but has anyone thought this all the way through and codified a white paper?
