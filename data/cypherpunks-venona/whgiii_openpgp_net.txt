Well this is the last thing the USPS wants to do (power corrupts and all
that) and they have a few congress critters on their side. A while back they had the postmaster general on C-Span giving his yearly
report to congress. USPS is scared to death of the internet and have been
scrambling around trying to find a way to generate revenue from it. Back
then they were talking about establishing USPS as a national CA and a
center for certified e-mail. I guess they realized that there is no way
they can compete in the marketplace and the only thing to do is to force
their system on everyone.
Now enter the usual suspects and their agenda:
Mandate USPS e-mail addresses for everyone.
Mandate National Electronic ID's (security measure for USPS e-mail).
Mandate use of National CA for ID's (run by USPS).
Mandate GAK for all e-mail on the USPS system.
Mandate all communication to & from government use USPS system.
*Big* tax increase to pay for it all with plenty of pork to go round. Hell
in a few years you will have them whining and crying that computer
ownership is a "right" and we need to *pay* for all those welfare bums to
have one (how else will they get their mail?). At a very minimum every
post office will be set up with public computer terminals so people can
get their mail.
Many of the unusual suspects that will go along with this plan will be
from the states like Alaska, Idaho, North Dakota, ...ect who are fearful
that their constituents will actually have to pay a fair price to have
mail and packages delivered to bum-fuck nowhere. I don't recall the name
but one of the critter from Alaska was very upset that if USPS looses it's
monopoly delivery in Alaska would no longer be subsidized and that they
might have to pay market value to have packages delivered by plane to the
far reaches of the wilderness (god forbid!!).

1st off the whole notion of "hostile environment" is bunk. It is a loosely

anything that might "offend" a PCer then you have a "hostile workplace".
As I said in previous posts you do not have a right to not be offended not
only that but thanks to the 1st Amendment I have the right to offend you.
One should be very carefull of this whole notion of protecting people from
being offended. Not only does it erode the rights protected under the
Constitution but it can very easily be turned against those who are
promoting it. Political tides are turning and the country as a whole is
getting fed up with the PC crowd. I can see lawsuits in the not to distant
