@_subject: PGP and Digi-money 
in seeing the experiment run. The way it was talked about earlier this
week, I pictured a system where people would snail-mail an amount of money
to a central authority (bank) and would be turned into credits. Since this
was only a simulation (not to raise eyebrows) I was thinking that a cap
could be established (say, $25). Now it looks as if we'll have no acutal
cash backing for the first simulation. How will this be distributed?
Should everyone on the list be given a set amount of digital cash to start
the 'poker game', or will we choose a smaller, representative sample? `bank', scripts to handle incoming cash requests, etc. Are these the least
of our worries? little C. I have a decent background in various other areas which may be
helpful. version that may help me out? My 286 plugs along when working on keys. :)
I am specifically wondering if anyone has hacked in and created a PGP that
supports the '87 coprocessor.

@_subject: weak point of PGP implementation 
tcmay says:
With strong crypto, e.g., with 300 decimal digit moduli, the "costs"
of decryption by brute force could easily exceed the GNP/GDP of the
bagged" the house, perhaps a simple pass phrase was used in lieu of
memorizing 300 digits, and so on.
I've been wondering about this. It seems as though the weak point of PGP
is one of three possible things:
target, but noone using pgp uses anything so absurdly small, so this can
be all but ruled out barring any huge jumps in factoring .. files, etc. What crypto, exactly, is used? How strong is it? If the NSA
knocked on the door and demanded your computer, would it try to crack your
key, or would it go directly for the secring.pgp file?
weakest point mentioned yet. How long does the pass phrase have to be
until this point becomes as secure as the weaker of the above two? If all
bits of your passphrase were random, how long would an exhaustive search
take? Matt Thomlinson

Yes, a very valid point.  But it seems to me, that Random Data
claim is the best, with the highest chances to keep one out of
trouble (if anything can :-).
The algorithm? Oh, sorry, but it's a HARDWARE random data generator!
And if it's truly good random gen, there are no patterns to track...
One can use it to create huge one-time pads, BTW...   "Salt" some of
the encrypted (or plaintext :-) messages with those...
Yes? Hardware? Well, then, where is the piece of hardware you used, then?
It seems this falls to the Big Brother 'where is the algorithm' test even
harder, as it is a physical piece of equipment.
It seems to me that if I were an agent and I were looking for
transmissions from an individual and I saw him sending out 10 copies of
the `Rocky & Bullwinkle Show' intro per week, I'd look into those, even
though they seem normal enough. When I checksummed them and they didn't
match, I'd be more than suspicious: I'd start stripping the lower bits
off. If I knew that the suspect used PGP and RIPEM, I'd most certainly try
and push the output through them, if they weren't plainly recognizable.
Seems to me that the best thing to hide pgp in would be a low-quality
host-medium (lots of noise!) that changes frequently, so the checksumming
cannot occur against the same message. The low quality could also be
attained by pushing more of your message into the host; maybe alternating
between the 8th bit and another bit. In any case, I don't think that the
host should be a stable one (frequently used) or one that can be easily
compared to the original.

tcmay's comments on the use of DAT tapes to 'dub off' other recordings as
the host-medium and to apply the signal to the low-end significant bits
works out something I brought up earlier: checking the copy against the
The idea of using a DAT tape as a mode of transport, however, doesn't
appeal that greatly to me. To send a message, I have to pull out one of my
prevoiusly recorded DAT host-tapes, then record over the 5th song with my
mix of host/message pair, then fed-ex it (or hand-deliver it) to my
target. If I take this signal and push it across internet, I no longer
have the passive-looking DAT tape in my DAT music collection. Instead, I
have a 900k sound file that I push across the net. Since the net is
usually not used to push the latest Michael Jackson tune, it might raise a
flag. Tim's comments are valid and definitely help solve problems on the
physical level: now how about cyberspace?

@_subject: HIDE: embedded msgs in grphics & snd 
Recently George Gleason and myself have exchanged email concerning the
embedding of messages into broadcast medium. We discussed options that
would confound the traffic analysis performed upon the host medium. We
came up with a few ideas that may be interesting to the list.
George pointed out what I pointed out earlier - sending the latest
Michael Jackson tune over the net might raise eyebrows as well as
copyright violations. Being from the 'grunge town' of Seattle, it was
discussed that perhaps it would be possible to send a copy of some
'unknown' band over the net without harm. In fact, perhaps this is a
good place to start: the underground music scene.
gg - "This week on Music By Wire, a new song by the Subversives,
recorded at Pretty Good Productions. . ."
This distribution channel has advantages over DAT -- no delay and the
possibility of a large audience if there was a steady flow of musical
Next, discussion turned to the integration of modem carrier tones as
samples in music (rap). If this new twist caught on, the artist could
encode messages (in plaintext, or later ciphertext) into the song,
including the key on the record insert. What does this do for us? By
using ciphertext "... as an artistic product, ..[we] thereby gain
another layer of 1st Amendment protection." Free speech.
Lastly and perhaps most interesting: I suggested that by using one of
these garage bands, we might be able to distribute our own messages
on CD. By getting ahold of a local bands' master before they take it
to get a record pressed, we could digitize it ourselves, encode our
messages (the kama sutra, a message of goodwill, the songs' lyrics,
whatever the band wants, too!) into the LSBs and then give it back to
the band to press CDs (put the key on the front cover if you like).
The band could be told that not only were they certain to sell ~100
CDs (@ $12-$14 each = $1,300 -- no small sum for a garage band) just
to cypherpunk members, but they would also be "the first band in
history to digitally encode messages into their music... etc."
I don't think the ~100 CDs is an understatement, either. How many
cypherpunks do we have nowadays? I would be willing to shell over
$15 for a (basically) small-capacity encrypted CD ROM disk, even
though I personally don't have a player.
gg and myself are both rather interested in this last idea --
tweaking with a bands' CD before it gets pressed. Does it
sound promising to anyone else?

What P Nave just said about beginning to give cash credit to those who receive bogus messages as a dead-letter dropoff point makes sense. If I were a subscriber to the dead-letter club, I'd receive a stipend monthly by each remailer operator for use of my account as a dead letter office. In turn, we could begin using these credits to enact some pay-per-send remailers. The remailers with dead-letter club participants would enjoy a greater amount of business (perhaps) because of their greater amount of traffic -> security through volume.

Yes, those of us who run remailers sometimes run them from university accounts. Such was my case.
The university of washington (without knowing it :) supported remailing at one time, through phantom I am not root here (and never will be!), and such access is not needed to set up a remailer. Instead, Hal Finney has written up a few remailer scripts which depend only on your ability to create a .forward file, and have perl available. (oh, also about.. ~1Mb for all of the scripts + PGP + keyring). There were no problems with my remailer and it was well-used. No scripts of incoming or outgoing mail were kept. The remailer lived for a few months last year, which actually isn't bad when you consider it was based on a student account with a nazi-like administration. :)
The death-blow was a remailer target complaining to me about someone sending unsolicited mail to them through my remailer. Instead of replying to my account (phantom they saw that the header had "nobody on it, and when mail to that address bounced, they sent to postmaster.
The mail to the postmaster was very polite and simply asked that the mail
cease, either by taking away the remailing ability from the perpetrator or
blocking the destination address. Of course, the postmaster didn't know
anything about this, and when he looked into it, he was quite suprised. I was able to keep it limping for about another week. I got support from a few cypherpunks around here, people on the list like JDraper, TMay, etc., and from others including Whit Diffie, Neal Koblitz, etc.
I might have been able to fight the shutdown, but I saw it as a losing In any case, no, it takes no special abilities to run a remailer; everything is pretty much packaged for ease-of-use.

I've been thinking about this problem as long as the rest of you have, and have finally come to the conclusion that 1) eric doesn't want to change the way the list software and 2) eric is going to continue to be human and not be able to reply to subscribe/unsub messages as fast as something like majordomo could.

I don't think the current discussion is taking into account the fact that if someone suspects you of using steganography they're going to check. If what you are describing becomes a popular way of steganography, you're out of luck -- they'll check that first. Think about it: your 'bad-sector' stego or 'wiped-filespace' stego begins gaining popularity. Wouldn't you think they'd check for funny bad sectors if they were going to check your computer for contriband info? Another thing that has bothered me: if you didn't have the sectors marked,
you'd need to remember where they were (so you could protect them from
writes). You wouldn't necessarily want to do this on the computer; it'd be
there for the picking. How to do it?f
Someone suggested you just use the end of the wiped filespace (use norton
or other utility to defrag the disk and move empty space to the end of the
disk, then use portion of disk furthest away from being written to. This might work, except for the fact that fragmentation _does_ go on, and when you were to write files to the drive (heck, I do every time I start up windows and write a huge temp swapfile) you're going to be playing roulette with your data. I think the point about the blank track (the one linux uses) is

I can see how a stealth-PGP would allow you to hide messages on your disk in "wiped" filespace -- it'd look like garbage (maybe -- see Aside), if anyone took a look. What does this buy you, though, if you've got a telltale TSR hanging around?
how do you control individual writes? You've got to know where they are vs. where your data is kept. Authorize each write by hand? (PROGMAN.EXE is attempting to write to cylinder 12, track 14. Authorize (y/N)? ) Icky. Do it another way? See below.
exactly my point. It seems you've got to have one of two things with your system: 1) a standard place where you hide your noise file (for example, use norton to defrag and compress your disk, then ALWAYS write your noise file on the last two cylinders.) Problem: Needs some program to revive the info; this is a tip-off... Also,
once your stealth system becomes known, the reason for hiding the noise file is gone -- the tracks/cyl will be checked if they find the reviving program. Instant noise file. 2) a non-standard place/way to hide your noise file (for example, using a TSR with the areas not to write being protected; using the TSR when you need to restore the data later). Problem: Needs program in memory (or info on disk about where it resides) to revive the data later. A tip-off that again defeats the purpose of hiding the noise file.
Analysis: It seems with the systems I can think of you need to have the
area the noise file stored in either 1) standard (ick) or 2) kept in
memory so you don't overwrite it. If you don't protect it, I wouldn't
expect your noise file to have a very large half-life. :l Keeping the area
in memory (under protection) defeats the system. Aside: By the way, isn't the "noise" in your noise file is going to be
more random looking than other deleted areas of your disk? PGP compresses
and then encrypts; I'll bet that it is possible to distinguish pgp's
output bit frequencies from those of a binary or text file, which is what
the rest of the wiped space would most likely be. Matt Thomlinson                               Say no to the Wiretap Chip!

correct. I was commenting on the ability of the stealth-pgp to create output not associated with PGP; I didn't mean to imply that s-pgp would be designed to do the deletion on its own. sorry.
I'd say having a TSR "hideit.com" loaded into high memory (installed size:
xxxx bytes) watching INT (whatever) would be a pretty good clues that
someone trying to determine that you were using a program to protect areas
of your disk would look for. Perhaps you could try and hide this, too; in any case, you address TSRs later...
uh, I don't have one. Do you?
I'm NOT talking about how to recover areas of your disk (you could use something like Norton Utilities to pull the noise file off the disk). What I'm trying to understand is how you plan to keep that area of your disk off limits. Like it or not, programs and OSs (if you can call Windows an OS) write to disk. Lots. Everywhere. How do you keep it from fragmenting the disk immediately and overwriting the space (whose address you have written down on that sheet of paper next to your computer?)
Try running windows with a temp swapfile. Run photoshop for windows (it writes its' own tempfile on the drive). Save a file from Word for Windows and try and control where it goes.
I'm not saying these problems can't be solved; I _am_ saying that what has been proposed thus far doesn't adequately address this (if you're looking at this as a genuine way to hide your data).
No, no. We _need_ to protect the noise area. how? change the FAT? TSR? My example above was an attempt to try and
understand what a TSR you might build would have to ask, every single time
a regular write to disk was performed. (to protect your deleted noise
except for the fact that your computer will overwrite your data (which, in fact, is *deleted* space, waiting to be written over) in the meantime.
Ah, a floppy? this makes 10 times more sense. With a floppy you wouldn't have haphazard writes to disk (as you do with your harddrive). sure. two choices:
1) We must protect our noise data.
that area from writes. 2) We don't protect our noise data. hope that by the time we need to retreive it, the data hasn't been written over. I sure wouldn't want to count on 2), and it seems as if 1) defeats the not bad. One thing to consider: we've moved all of our data to the end of the disk, anyway; we'd still have most of our important data at the end of the disk, which still might look conspicuous statistically.
not bad. Takes (8 times?) more space, but should work.
Do you understand my objection to keeping track of the files' location by hand? It isn't that keeping track of the location/length of the file is hard, or retreiving it is tough; the problem is keeping the OS, etc from overwriting it in the meantime.

I've been talking to Sergey behind the scenes, and I think I understand what our miscommunication was: he is proposing this type of technique ONLY for removable-type media, e.g. floppies. To store this type of data on your harddrive would be to dedicate your
harddrive to stego. This was my argument all along; what we failed to
connect on was the fact that only floppies are involved. With floppies,
every write *can* be controlled and the data would be relatively safe (and
obscure, for that matter). This correction is being posted to the list because his original post said nothing about removable media.

I think these two have a lot to do with each other. Sergeys' suggestion would definitely make it a tougher to pick out a starting place to search for hidden text. However, the message (if it is ever found in the file) points to the intended recipient. This defeats the purpose of "stealth pgp", (which would probably be used in this case to strip off telltale headers and such). If you weren't worried about this type of deniability, though, I don't see a problem with it.

@_subject: brainstorming on cpunks' eve 
As is mentioned in tims' latest Rant(tm), I've been working on ideas for
creating other cypherpunk services that would be possible to deply to the
net. I've come up with a few, but they are of dubious quality. I'm hoping that by posting ideas I know are flawed/of little use that followup disscussion might refine them. We saw a use for remailers -- to gain a certain anonymity not present in cyberspace. How about information drops? How about digital cash drops (alt.cash.drop anyone?) I know digicash isn't the rage, and such a
group would probably do zero good for some time, but I'd like to start
talking about the ideas. With payments in digicash, you could supply a public key (newly created, of course). After the cash is generated/remitted by the other party, it would be encrypted and posted to the group. Noone could use the cash
as it sat there, since they can't unwrap the cash. (I like to think of it
as dropping the cash in a sealed envelope). I'm trying to think of both
uses and problems this exhibits. Lots of extra "session keys" is the only
drawback I see. Other possible net services: random number services, which don't keep
logs of the numbers it produces -- have it spit a statistically-correct
random stream each time a port is opened? Would this be that useful?
Also, one could set up a hashing/signing service, more akin to a time
stamp service. Mail would be sent to your service, which would attach
the output of 'date' to the bottom of the msg and then +clearsig it. I'm
thinking that chains of two or maybe three reliable machines should be used, since all it takes to break this is to change the clock on the
machine you're signing with. With a few (>1) machines, it becomes
very clear that the message was sent at a certain time. Perhaps this could be used in the future for "Registered Mail" type exchanges, or perhaps as part of a "Digital Notary" system?
As for our media coverage, I'm happy with it so far. I'm willing to bet
digicash that we'll see _television_ coverage re: clipper in the next few months. EFF, among others, should be working on that; we've already been able to get the word out via newspapers/magazines and radio. I wouldn't be at all suprised to see a blip on 20/20 or maybe a 15-second
spot by Tom Jennings & co. before July. And projects! I'm currently in the middle of finals, but I'm looking
forward to getting back to work on the things that _really_ matter. I was wondering what people were thinking about putting together a page for WWW? Would it be useful? Would people browsing around look at
it and would it be a medium to disseminate info? Maybe divide it up...

Privacy in the Digital Age
by Curtis Lang
NewMedia, April 1994
Welcome to the digital frontier, where network by network, metaphor by metaphor, a splendid, global, multimedia palace is being built through trial and error. You won't need to take a long and winding road to this frontier, though, it's coming soon to your home. You'll know it has arrived when you can read messages on your telephone, have a dialogue with your television and watch beautiful movies on your PC. AT&T has already established a giant encampment on this digital frontier, and it is now concentrating on building a virtual community. In advertisements, the company paints seductive pictures of fully wired--and wireless--consumers interacting in the cyberspace equivalent of Hemingway's dean, well-lighted place. A happy couple in a jumbo kitchen uses a computerized telephone to take and receive electronic messages and make reservations for the ball game. A nomadic businessman in an airport shuttle bus tells his PDA how much he's willing to spend on a used car for his son, what makes he prefers and the maximum acceptable mileage. He sends his PDA on a shopping trip around the region with a single touch. It all sounds thrilling--empowering for consumers and businesses alike. But in the 21st-century world of interactive television, broadband Internet access and ubiquitous multipurpose communications gizmos, every message you send and each dollar you spend could be an unbidden messenger as well. Electronic traces of your passage will remain in data banks of cable, telephone and on-line service providers. And the government wants to install a trap door in software and hardware used to encrypt messages and data from medical smart cards, IRS records, digital cash transfers and plain old e-mail. These databases will be digital gold in the world of direct marketing, where vendors and advertisers will tailor special offers to individuals based upon this information and deliver coupons that will issue from your smart cable TV set-top box What's to prevent unscrupulous third parties--or underpaid government workers with access to the software trap door--from obtaining information that could be used to harm consumers? Not much, judging from stories like that of black-data buccaneer Al Schweitzer, who bought and sold confidential government files for a living (see "Penetrating Uncle Sam's Data," page 68). Unless government agencies, infrastructure suppliers, software wizards and producers of programming can guarantee privacy in the rapidly expanding web of cyberspace, it may be impossible for the trust upon which a virtual community depends to develop sufficiently to make the grand digital experiment a success. Without this assurance there will be no secure business communications, and the kind of transactional data that is currently gathered by insurance firms, credit companies and banks might fall into the hands of anyone with the skills to track it across the global network Security of transactions over cable networks is already a concern to American consumers, according to surveys by Viacom Cable and others. And the lack of secure transaction methods may already be hampering buying and selling via modem. Consumer's unwillingness to put it on their Visa when traveling in cyberspace has slowed public acceptance of such services as American Airlines' Easy Sabre ticket service, available on Prodigy, America Online and other on-line services. Consumers, like businesses, are eager to take advantage of the digital highway, but they are leery of financial data and other sensitive information falling into the wrong hands. ENCRYPTION MAY BE THE KEY
When you make a phone call or send a letter, you can be fairly certain that the contents of your communications will remain private. Such trust makes our postal and phone systems possible. AT&T hopes to give customers that same sense of security about wireless communications. It is the first company to implement General Magic's new Telescript communications software in its PersonaLink Services, which will be the foundation for AT&T's multimedia web of services that include smart messaging, electronic shopping and custom news delivery. "Telescript. .is a technology which creates something called agent-based communication," explained Marc Porat, chairman and CEO of General Magic, at a winter conference on electronic consumer appliances in New York Such software agents will be able to travel throughout wired and wireless networks searching for information, like-minded individuals or bargain prices on PCs. Agents will act as your virtual doorman, your e-mail bozo filter, tossing mail on subjects you nix into the trash. "General Magic is a really good idea," contends Jerry Michalski of the industry newsletter, Release l.a "You can create a little agent that .[will] go out there and look for things for you. Let's say you're a stamp collector--it can look for a particular kind of stamp, or a bubble-gum card or whatever, and maybe even buy the thing for you automatically. Now, gosh, you're putting that up on AT&T's network. They could find out within very small fractions of activity what you're doing, what your preferences are, what kind of agents you've decided to broadcast into the world. So you're only going to do that if you have some kind of confidence that they're not going to misuse that information." To that end, AT&T and General Magic intend to set up "trusted spaces," secure virtual meeting rooms where your agent can meet with another agent, representing a vendor or an individual, and communicate, shop, cut deals or consummate business transactions free from prying software. But what about the security of these networks? And how will you know the identity of the entity lurking behind the vir-
tual agent that your virtual agent is schmoozing up in supposedly secure cyberspace? "Most wireless communications systems are security nightmares," says Jim Bidzos, president of RSA Data Security Inc., a giant in the global cryptography business. "They have no real encryption, no authentication.... General Magic realized that for a lot of people, wireless services of any kind simply can't be trusted. So they built RSA encryption and authentication services right into the foundation of Telescript and Magic Cap [the interface for General Magic's PDA]." A DIFFERENT VIEW
Advocates of civil liberties such as the cypherpunks, the grassroots encryption experts who have developed widely distributed personal encryption shareware for e-mail, worry that even in such a security-conscious system, the government will find a way to snoop. They see alternatives to AT&T's vision of tomorrow. "The issue of digital money is going to be key," argues Tim May, "so that people can buy access codes." May, formerly a physicist with Intel and one of the most visible cypherpunks, envisions a future in which digital cash is used for most transactions. In such a system encryption schemes would be floating through the computer community that could make most financial transactions virtually untraceable. "Imagine a satellite dish on your roof," he continues. "You decide to buy an X-rated movie, and you don't want records kept of that on your monthly bill. [There will be] mechanisms by which you can buy 'coupons' that are usable on a one-time basis to decrypt a packet, and the vendor of the service--say, the seller of the X-rated movie--has no idea that you, in particular, are decrypting his packet. I think that'll be essential." DO YOU TRUST UNCLE SAM?
After months of review, during which a torrent of digital complaints flooded the White House from multinational corporations, the Software Publishers Association, cypherpunks and civil libertarians, President Clinton announced that he wants the National Security Agency (NSA) to implement secret standards for encryption to be used in computerized communications systems to facilitate e-mail surveillance.     The Computer Security Act of 1987 mandated that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a civilian agency, develop appropriate standards for digital communications networks. At the time it was clear that there would be a need for digital envelopes (cryptography), digital signatures and other technologies to provide security and enable legally enforceable digital transactions on the Internet, and eventually across fiber-optic cables and wireless systems connected to telephones, computers, TVs and PDAs. However, during the Bush administration, a series of executive orders placed authority for developing those standards in the hands of the NSA, America's largest and most secretive spy organization, which has a checkered history that includes large-scale illegal surveillance of Americans. Thus it was no surprise that the agency's proposal to provide digital encryption systems focused on easy wiretap surveillance rather than privacy, security and other civilian needs. The NSA produced a 64-bit encryption algorithm, classified "Secret" and called Skipjack The NSA declined to make the algorithm public, prompting concern that, given the NSA's track record, there might be a "trap door" in Skipjack that would allow secret surveillance of all Skpjack-encoded messages. In April 1993, the White House outlined plans for a microcircuit called the Clipper chip, which would scramble telephone conversations. Each chip, encoded with Skipjack, would generate an encryption session key, a chip unique key and a chip family key, all of which are sent to the receiver. The White House asks users to register their chip unique key with the government, which will then split each key into two parts and "escrow" the parts with two different agencies, so that law enforcement agencies can unscramble suspects' messages. SURVEILLANCE ON THE UPSWING
The White House claims that the system would be used by government officials with legal authorization to conduct wiretaps and thus represents no intensification of government surveillance. But in NIST's letter inviting five hand-picked cryptography experts to do a quick survey of Skipjack, the agency says that key components will be made available "only to authorized government officials under proper legal authorizations, usually a court order." They said usually, not always. The distinction was not accidental. For the last several years, the FBI has been increasing its surveillance of all Americans at a dizzying pace as part of a mind-boggling expansion of its powers and activities. This includes increased access to computerized data on Americans, which now often no longer requires a court order to be accessed. The Bush average of 332 wiretap applications per year was double that of the Reagan administration, and state agencies' wiretaps also increased during the Bush years. Despite the rapid increase of such requests, wiretaps are far from widespread, and according to the June 1993 issue of the Privacy Journal, the FBI has publicized no instances in which its investigations were hampered because a suspect had used encrypted e-mail or other digital security devices. The Clinton administration asked for an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act that would allow the FBI to obtain credit information, without a court order, by issuing a "national security letter." The rationale is that although the FBI has access to your bank records, it will not know which banks' records to obtain without ready access to your credit reports, as David MacMichael reports in the National Security Alumni Association Magazine, Unclassified (October/November 1993). OPERATION ROOT CANAL
Meanwhile, the FBI continues to move forward with "Operation Root Canal," also known as the 1992 Digital Telephony Proposal, which encourages service and equipment providers to design their computerized systems in such a way that the government can easily "obtain the plain text contents of voice, data and other communications," according to FBI memoranda obtained by the nonprofit Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) from the Commerce Department in November of last year. The threat of the Digital Telephony Proposal to telecommunications companies is very real. CPSR reported that Rep. Jack Brooks, a Texas Democrat, said that Root Canal "could obstruct or distort telecommunications technology development by limiting fiber optic transmission, ISDN, digital cellular services and other technologies until they are modified...and could impair the security of business communications. .could facilitate not only lawful government interception, but unlawful interception by others [and] could impose on industries' ability to offer new services and technologies." And the NSA, which oversees export-control regulations of weapons of war--including encryption products--has signaled its intent to prevent grassroots cryptography from enlisting enough users to constitute a de facto standard. Recently Phil Zimmerman, the creator of Pretty Good Privacy, a popular and widely available piece of encryption shareware, was busted for export-control violations (see "Penetrating Uncle Sam's Data," below). After all, if everyone has access to encryption techniques, when law enforcement agencies decrypt the Skipper algorithm on someone's intercepted message, they'll find a secondary layer of encryption that could be more difficult to crack That would render Skipjack pointless; some Clinton critics worry that the logical outcome of Skipjack implementation will be the criminalization of other forms of encryption. Never mind the implications for secure business communications. With a government-imposed Skpjack standard, the feds would be able to do something they have never been able to do before--easily conduct mass surveillance. THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY
"No right of private conversation was enumerated in the Constitution," said Sun Microsystems' Whitfield Diffie, one of the pioneers of modern civilian encryption, in June 1993 testimony before the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance. "I don't suppose it occurred to anyone at the time that it could be prevented. Now, however, we are on the verge of a world in which electronic communication is both so good and so inexpensive that intimate business and personal relationships will flourish between parties who can, at most, occasionally afford the luxury of traveling to visit each other.

@_subject: Anderson's RSA Trapdoor Can Be Broken 
The name of the article I cited earlier is in the subject line. Written by Burton S. Kaliski Jr, of RSA Labs, on **March 19, 1994**. An abstract:
RSA public-key cryptosystem whereby ahardware device generates RSA primes
p and p' in such a way that the hardware manufacturer can easily factor
the RSA modulus n = pp'. Factoring the modulus hopefully remains difficult
for all other parties. the manufacturer. For 256-bit RSA primes, the secret value A is 200 bits long. The device generates primes p of the form
p = rA + q = r(q,A)A + q. (1)
where q is at most about 100 bits long, and  is 56 bits long and a function of A and q. To factor the RSA modulus n = pp', the manufacturer reduces the modulus modulo A to recover the product qq', following the relationship n = pp' = rr'A^2 + (rq' + r'q)A + qq'. (2)
recovers the primes p and p' accordingly. Factoring such ``trapped'' moduli is easy. [...goes into easy-to-tex, hard-to-ascii derivation...]
...Such inequalities are called ``simultaneous Diophantine approximations,'' ... [and these will be solvable for these parameter lengths when (number of keys) >= 13]
value to each device [...] The user does not need 14 moduli to find A,
however.  Two prime factors p and p' suffice, since the fraction r'/r is
such a good approximation to the fraction p'/p that it is guaranteed to be
a convergent in the continued fraction expansion of p'/p. The user can
therefore detect a trapdoor even if the device generates each modulus with
a different secret value. trapdoor is concerned, is for the device to generate each modulus with a
different secret value and to keep the prime factors secret. In such a
sitiation, the manufacturer may as well preload the device with the primes
and escrow copies--a practical ``trapdoor'' to which all cryptosystems,
not just RSA, are vulnerable. check out rsa.com for the real copy: I left out about 3 equations relating to the diophantine approximations, but the text is pretty much copied in its entirety. Matt Thomlinson                               Say no to the Wiretap Chip!

For personal use only -- posted without permission
"Classified algorithm for encryption"
IEEE Spectrum, April 1994. Federal policy makers should reconsider the Clipper/Skipjack cryptography scheme, which employs a classified algorithm and Government-held keys as the basis of a new encryption standard, according to a six-page statement by IEEE-United States Activities. "Federal cryptography policy should not fight technological progress by attempting to retain outdated techniques of surveillance at the cost of the reliability and the security of the American information infrastructure," the statement concluded.
The reasons given for issuing the statement included IEEE-USA's concerns that classified algorithms "cannot be proven secure," that individuals seeking to avoid detection would simply choose another cryptography method that can be downloaded from the Internet, and that law enforcement agencies can use other new methods--from vibration-sensing lasers on windows to keyboard-trapping programs.

[Since this should also be of interest to the Cypherpunks list, which Ray
is/was subscribed to, I am posting this essay to that list.]
Zero knowledge interactive proof systems ("ZKIPS") are sometimes called
"minimum disclosure proofs" (with some subtle differences) and are exciting
and mysterious (at first) methods that lie at the heart of modern
cryptology. Here's a simple explanation. Too bad we don't have a
ALICE AND BOB (some people call them Peggy the Prover and Vic the Verifier)
Alice wishes to prove to Bob that she knows some item of knowledge without
actually giving Bob any of that knowledge.
Let us first imagine that Alice claims she knows a "Hamiltonian cycle" on a
particular graph. (For a given set of nodes and arcs linking some of those
nodes, a Hamiltonian cycle is one which passes through each node once and
only once. You might want to draw some graphs on a sheet of paper and try
to find a Hamiltonian cycle for the graphs, to get a feel for the problem.)
The particular graph may be "registered" somewhere with Alice's claim that
she--and only she, for reasons I'll discuss at the end--knows a Hamiltonian
cycle for the graph. In a sense, this is her "proof of identity."
To make this example concrete, Alice is using this piece of knowledge as
her *password* to get into some system. She presents a map of 50  cities
and some set of highways interconnecting them and says "I am who I say I am
if and only if I know a Hamiltonian cycle for this graph."
The conventional (non zero knowledge) way to convey this knowledge is for
Alice to simply *show* the Hamiltonian cycle to Bob. This is how passwords
are currently handled. Bob, and anybody else who is spying on the exchange,
then knows the "secret," which isn't a secret anymore. (Anybody who saw the
exchange, including Sysadmin Bob, could then impersonate her.)
ENTER ZERO KNOWLEDGE
Alice, instead of showing Bob the Hamiltonian cycle, takes the cities and
covers them with something, say, coins. (On a computer, this is all done in
software, using the cryptographic protocol called "bit commitment.")
Alice scrambles the position of the cities (covered by coins) so as not to
allow positional cues. (Most of the 50 cities should have about the same
number, ideally exactly the same number, of links to other cities, to
ensure that some cities are not "marked" by having some unique number of
links. A detail.) Needless to say, she scrambles the cities out of sight of
Bob, so he can't figure out which cities are which. However, once she's
done with the scrambling, she displays the cities in such a way that she
can't *later change*..i.e., she "commits" to the values, using well-known
cryptographic methods for this. (If this sounds mysterious, read up on it.
It's how "mental poker" and other crypto protocols are handled.)
Bob sees 50 cities with links to other cities, but he doesn't have any way
of knowing which of the covered cities are which. Nor, I should add, are
the links labelled in any way--it wouldn't do to have some links
permanently labelled "Route 66" or "Highway 101"!
She says to Bob: "Pick one choice. Either you can see a Hamiltonian cycle
for this set of covered cities and links, or you can see the cities
uncovered." In other words, "Alice cuts, Bob chooses."
Bob tosses a coin or chooses randomly somehow and says: "Show me the cities."
Alice uncovers all the cities and Bob examines the graph. He sees that
Akron is indeed connected to Boise, to Chicago, to Denver, not to Erie, and
so on. In short, he confirms that Alice has shown him the original graph.
No substitution of another graph was made.
Bob, who is suspicious that this person is really who she claims to be, says to Alice: "Ok, big deal! So you anticipated I was going to ask you to
show me the cities. Anybody could have gotten Alice's publicly registered
graph and just shown it to me. You had a 50-50 chance of guessing which
choice I'd make."
Alice smugly says to him: "Fine, let's do it again." She scrambles the
cities (which are covered) and displays the graph to Bob...50 covered
cities and various links between them. She tells Bob to choose again.
This time Bob says: "Show me the Hamiltonian cycle."
Without uncovering the cities (which would give the secret away, of
course), Alice connects the cities together in a legal Hamiltonian cycle.
Bob says, "OK, so this time you figured I was going to ask you the opposite
of what I did last time and you just substituted some other graph that you
happened to know the Hamiltonian cycle of. I have no guarantee the graphs
are really the same."
Alice, who knows this is just the beginning, says: "Let's do the next round."
...and so it goes....
After 30 rounds, Alice has either produced a legal Hamiltonian cycle or a
graph that is the same as (isomorphic to...same cities linked to same other
cities) the registered graph in each and every one of the rounds.
There are two possibilities:
1. She's an imposter and has guessed correctly *each time* which choice Bob
will make, thus allowing her to substitute either another graph altogether
(for when Bob wants to see the Hamiltonian cycle) or just the original
graph (for when Bob asks to see the cities uncovered to confirm it's the
real graph). Remember, if Alice guesses wrong even once, she's caught
2. She really is who she claims to be and she really does know a
Hamiltonian cycle of the specified graph.
The odds of  being true drop rapidly as the number of rounds are
increased, and after 30 rounds, are only 1 in 2^30, or 1 in a billion. Bob
choose to believe that Alice knows the solution.
Alice has conveyed to Bob proof that she is in possession of some knowledge
without actually revealing any knowledge at all! The proof is
This is the essence of a zero knowledge proof. There's more to it than just
this example, of course, but this is the basic idea.
SOME DETAILS
1. Could someone else discover the Hamiltonian cycle of Alice's graph? Exhaustive search is the only way to guarantee a solution will be
found--the Hamiltonian cycle problem is a famous "NP-complete"
combinatorial problem. This is intractable for reasonable numbers of nodes.
50 nodes is intractable. 2. If finding a Hamiltonian cycle is intractable, how the hell did Alice
ever find one?
She didn't *have* to find one! She started with 50 cities, quickly
connected them so that the path went through each city only once and then
wrote this path down as her "secret" solution. Then she went back and added
the other randomly chosen interconnects to make the complete graph. For
this graph, she obviously knows a Hamiltonian cycle, *by construction*.
3. Can Bob reconstruct what the Hamilonian cycle must be by asking for
enough rounds to be done?
Not generally. Read the papers for details on this, which gets deeply into
under what circumstance partial knowledge of the solution gives away the
complete solution.
4. Are there other problems that can be used in this same way?
Yes, there are many forms. I find the Hamiltonian cycle explanation quite
easy to explain to people. (Though usually I can draw pictures, which helps
a lot.)
5. How general is the "zero knowledge interactive proof" approach?
Anything provable in formal logic is provable in zero knowledge, saith the
mathematicians and crypto gurus. Check out the various "Crypto Conference"
Hope this helps.

What Happens If, instead of using prime numbers or logarithms for the
basis for a public-key crypto system, we instead generated out public key
1> pick an arbitrary bit stream (large [pseudo?]random number, binary
representation of selected chunk of text or data file, etc).  1024 bits or
more (in 256 bit chunks?)
2> enter a passphrase
3> XOR the bit stream with the binary representation of the passphrase,
cycling the passphrase as necessary.  This makes the 'large' component of
our public key.
4> hash the passphrase to 128 or more (in blocks of 64?) bits.  This makes
the 'small' component of the public key.
5> We then use these components as in normal public-key algorithms.
(matt says:)
Okay, you're forgetting one thing. In public key systems, the two numbers you have are related -- the algorithm you use needs a pair of numbers that create a function and inverse function pair.
The pair you suggest above [((random  xor (passphrase)), hash(passphrase)] have nothing in common. Good, as you point out, since you can't create one from the other, but also bad for a public key system, since you can't use one to decrypt what the other encrypted (they're not inverses)!

Couldn't you just modify your remailer to search for the string "BEGIN

recognize if even if it doesn't have that header...?
Anyway, PGP puts ID bytes at the beginning of its files, and in
ascii-armor, public keys always begin with mQ and crypted messages begin
with hE or hI.  You could probably just dump the message if the first
line of the ASCII-armoring began with mQ...

@_subject: BANK: quite a bit of interest. 
I've had quite a few people ask for instructions for retreiving the ghostmarks I promised. Good to see that more people are getting involved. I'm more than willing to help people get going using the magic money implementations. I've just paid the winner of the sonics/nuggets pool. I'm offering 15 more
ghostmarks to the person most closely guessing the spread of the
sonics/nuggets game 5 on saturday. (as a reference, the winner this time
was only within 14 points of the spread!) You need not have your client installed to enter the pool.
I have a feeling that within the next few weeks we're going to see more and more items available via ghostmarks/tacky tokens/bakuins. Get set up now so you can participate later. Email for info.

@_subject: Message to Pr0duct Cypher 
I've been using magic money, the digital cash implementation. I have a few requests that maybe you could think about.
1) any hope for a macintosh version anytime soon? I've had a number of requests for it...
2) it seems possible to write a routine to report on the banks' current money supply; It'd be useful for me, anyhow. Using the info in elist.dat and dlist.dat and spent.dat I think it'd be trivial. Is it?
more later..

@_subject: Re: Reply to Phantom about Magic Money 
Great. I've just distributed an initial amount of cash; the money supply is around 70gm or so. Transactions (in the two days since conception) have been so-so. I've had two transactions personally -- one for consulting on html pages and one incentive for a key-signing. I'm about to begin offering services to further back my currency. I'm doing all of the transactions by hand, but if the traffic becomes heavy, I'll begin automating the process on one of our unix machines.
I'd like a pointer to this, as would a few of the people on the list (I can't name any names). I'll contact mpd.
many thanks for your software. PS: how about a different message besides "Bad RSA packet" when receiving a message not encrypted with the servers' key? Threw me off the first dozen times I saw it. :)

I have no idea why jim insists on sending 20 copies of my bounce back to the list. I've contacted netcom and am hoping they'll clear up this abuse of their user agreement. I'm not sure what jim expects to accomplish; his original rants were, well, rants. For a person trying to get crypto to the masses, he's doing a good job of trying to kill all crypto development. Good thinking, jim. His posts now have no apparent reason behind them other than to simply be an anti-social irritation to members of the list. Unless something else happens, this is the last you'll see me write about it on the list. I'm just going to install a filter so I can read cpunks around jim.

@_subject: GhostMarks 
The trading of ghostmarks has begun. I've personally been party to a half-dozen transactions from my own personal account, and have more than 20 clients. It's time for trade to begin large-scale. I've placed the names of those clients who agreed to be publicly listed on my finger info: These are people (although not the only ones) that are ready and willing
to begin transactions. Each of them has some sort of supply of ghostmarks.
Let the grand experiment begin.

nobody says:
Is there someone out there who would like to act as a broker (for a small
fee, natch), so that I can maintain rigorous anonymity while trading?
This seems like a good way to earn some ghostmarks! I'm sure *someone* will take you up on this offer.
Alternatively, you could perhaps do business through the penet remailer...?

@_subject: PsychicCash IPO 
PsychicCash(TM) Announces Initial Public Offering
PsychicCash, a leading developer of electronic commerce systems, today
announced that it will sell 4.5 Million shares of common stock at a price
of $25 a share. "This IPO will make me very rich" said co-founder Dan
Thompson, "but of course you already knew that."
PsychicCash pushes secure, thought-driven commerce into the modern world.
PsychicCash is the holder of a number of crucial psychic commerce patents,
including those on psychic blinding, psychic key-exchange, and psychic
anonymity. The PsychicCash technology is based on the idea that there is
no need for paper bills or plastic cards. Instead, a user simply thinks to
exchange money. PsychicCash requires no hardware, and little knowledge of
cryptography, however, it does require doing 1024-bit modular
exponentiation in your head.
"This is the logical progression of things," said PsychicCash supporter
Dionne Warwick. "The use of PsychicCash(TM) to secure transactions should
completely remove consumers' concerns about the safety of psychic
Through the use of their patented technology, PsychicCash allows users to
transmit value to any vendor, in any denomination, in any currency. With a
future release of the protocol, a few additional multiplications will
allow PsychicCash users to anonymize either party. The release is
currently on hold due to problems in accidentally revealing (thinking)
blinding factors.
"Psychic debit" technology allows secure transmission of value across time
as well as space. That is, one can deduct amounts from payee's bank
accounts before the idea to purchase has even been conceived.  (A similar
use of this technique overcomes prior art claims on PsychicCash patents by
shifting the date of filing back as far as needed.)
As with all cryptographic solutions, PsychicCash must first get export
approval from the US government for each of its' products. However, an
ingenious system, called telepathic key escrow (TKE), should allow the
company expedited commodities jurisdiction approval. Using TKE, a user
simply thinks his key to the National TKE Center, which will then allow
access to the key only with a court order. Whether or not other countries
will allow the NTKEC to escrow their citizens' keys is still unclear.
