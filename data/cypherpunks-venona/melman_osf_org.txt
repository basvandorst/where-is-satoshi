TO DEVELOP ELECTRONIC CHECK
FSTC Promises Early Demonstration Using the Internet

434-6883, Bank of Boston, FSTC URL: New York (Aug. XX, 1995) -- The Financial Services Technology Consortium
(FSTC) today announced the formation of a multi-industry team to design and
implement an lectronic check for use over the Internet by consumers and
 FSTC is a consortium whose goal is to utilize emerging technologies to
enhance the competitiveness of the financial services industry.
 The FSTC Electronic Check, which will work within the existing banking
infrastructure, brings the benefits of paper checks to electronic commerce,
while permitting the increased efficiency and timeliness of doing business
on the "net."  FSTC expects to demonstrate the Electronic Check within the
next two months.
 "This project is particularly significant because it represents the first
collaborative effort by major banks and their industry partners to develop
from inception a new financial standard," said Dan Schutzer, FSTC president
and Citibank vice president and director of advanced technology.
 "FSTC's Electronic Check is designed to be open, secure and convenient.
It will bring to electronic commerce on the Internet a level of security
and confidence currently found only in traditional banking products,"
Schutzer added.
 Bank members of the FSTC Electronic Check program are: Bank of America,
Bank of Boston, Bank of Montreal, Bank One, Chemical Bank, Citibank, and
Wells Fargo Bank.  Industry members are: BBN Inc. (Bolt Beranek & Newman),
Equifax, IBM Corporation, Information Resources Engineering Inc., National
Semiconductor, Sun Microsystems and Telequip. Research and consulting
organizations are: Bellcore, Oak Ridge and Sandia National Laboratories,
and the University of Southern California-Information Sciences Institute.
 Advisory members are:  Electronic Check Clearing House Organization
(ECCHO) and National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA).
 Appointed as the FSTC Electronic Check project director is John Doggett,
director of applied technology, and as project manager is Frank Jaffe,
senior systems consultant, both from Bank of Boston.
 "As shown by the over 60 billion checks written annually, paper checks are
the payment mechanism of choice.  We expect the FSTC Electronic Check and
its smart-card or PC-card checkbook to become the preferred method for
making and receiving payments due to its cost-effectiveness and embedded
safety features," Doggett said.  "The vision of a bank in your pocket, a
bank at your desk, a bank where your are, can now be achieved with the FSTC
electronic check," Doggett added.
 Formed in September 1993, FSTC is a consortium of some 65 organizations
comprising banks, financial services firms, industry partners, national
laboratories, universities, and government agencies.  FSTC sponsors
collaborative research and development on technical projects affecting the
entire financial services industry and its users with particular emphasis
on projects involving electronic commerce.  FSTC development projects
include interbank check image exchange, electronic commerce, and fraud
detection and management.
Editor's note:  Attached is a brief description of how the FSTC Electronic
Check works.
A Brief Description of How FSTC Electronic Check Works
 The FSTC Electronic Check will provide an enhanced all-electronic
replacement to the current paper check, and will be useable over any
 Paper checks and checkbooks will be replaced by electronic checkbooks,
handwritten signatures will be replaced by digital signatures and the
delivery by the postal service by the Internet or other electronic highway.
 These changes will greatly increase the convenience and security of check
writing since the entire process will be automated and integrated into
existing applications.
 By using "smart cards" and PC cards as electronic checkbooks the FSTC
Electronic Check will be almost impossible to forge.  Unlike paper checks,
the person accepting an FSTC Electronic Check for payment will be able to
verify that it has not been altered.
 As with paper checks, electronic checks will be an open payment
instrument, providing for third-party services and a variety of payment
options, such as travelers', cashiers' and certified checks.  FSTC
Electronic Checks also integrate into existing interbank clearing networks
such as the Federal Reserve System and various automated clearing houses.
 FSTC's unique approach to the Electronic Check results in a secure,
self-authenticating payment instrument that bridges the barrier between the
insecure public network and the trusted financial clearing systems.

You'll have a hard convincing folks that they need something
better than what works perfectly well today.
Here's another point that I didn't see in your list.  Today
it might be just as safe to send your CC# over the internet
as giving it to a clerk, etc.  This is mostly because the
number of CC sent over the net vs the whole traffic is
small.  It is therefore not very cost effective to try to
steal credit card numbers over the net vs other means
(searching through dumpsters, taping a phone line near LL
Bean, etc.).  If CC# purchases became common over the net,
it would become much more valuable to try to steal them from
the net and more people would.  It would then become much
less secure, not for any technical reason but because there
will be more crooks exploiting the existing flaws.
Where is it most common to steal cellular phone id's (I'm
not sure what they are called, but the id's sent that
someone can steal to build a forged cell phone)?  At
airports.  Why?  Because more cell phones are used there,
everyone uses one as they get on or off a plane.  If you
want to troll for id's, go to where there are many.

Reported in today's Wall Street Journal
  Basically Verifone's credit card processing technology
(credit card verification) will be bundled with Netscape's
Commerce server.
Netscape also announced that the software will use new
encryption technology being developed by MasterCard and
Visa.  I don't know what this quote means:
  That technology would break sensitive information like
  credit-card data into 1,024 bits of information, instead
  of the 128 bits used currently, theoretically making it
  much more difficult to steal.

The product is called DCE RPC and the RPC is used
generically as you stated in the beginning of your note.
There are many RPCs in the world, aside from the ones you
listed.  DCE RPC is also known as ISO RPC as the standard is
based on DCE.  MS RPC is also based on DCE RPC as you
stated. DCE is not part of OSF/1 but is middleware supporting
distributed computing which is available on virtually all
platforms: (Unixes, Windows, Cray, MVS, VMS, Mac is in beta,
etc.)  Yes, one of the reference ports was OSF/1.  We sell
the source code separately.
We are now seeing OSs bundled with DCE client software.
The most recent versions of HP/UX and AIX for example.
For more info on DCE see

@_subject: Re: software with "hooks" for crypto 
I am not a lawyer.
Hooks to encryption code have *sometimes* been considered
"ancillary devices" and as such are in violation of ITAR.
Calling another executable like pgp *might* be less of an
issue than having source code hooks that call crypto library
routines, but maybe not.  (And no I don't understand why
they would be different)
NCSA had something related to this in their use of PEM/PGP
in httpd.  See some info at:    which says:
  Note: As of NCSA HTTPd 1.4.1, support for PEM/PGP encryption
  was removed in order to bring NCSA in compliance with the
  Internation Treaty on Arms Reduction to which the United
  States of America is a signatory. We hope to have an
  improved version available with NCSA HTTPd 1.5 from an
  export controlled server.
In sum, check with a lawyer.
