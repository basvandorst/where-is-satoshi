@_subject: Announcing SecureDrive 2.4 
This is to announce the availability of Version 1.4 of SecureDrive.
SecureDrive Version 1.4 replaces version 1.3d and previous versions.
Changes for 1.4 have added significant new function.
New features include ability to use a keyfile either instead of or
in addition to a passphrase, the /ADD function and the option to
specify a drive letter, which is remembered, when specifying manual
partition parameters to LOGIN.
same key) at the same time.
The subroutine which "finds" a physical hard disk partition based on
the DOS drive letter has been improved, so hopefully situations where
manual partition parameters must be used will be rare.
Releases 1.3, 1.3a, 1.3d and 1.4 of Secure Drive are based on releases 1.0
and 1.1, mostly written by
  Mike Ingle and version 1.2, with significant new code by myself.
The code which we wrote is not copyrighted, but the program contains GNU
Copylefted code, and therefore may be freely distributed under the terms of
the GNU General Public Licence. See file COPYING for legalese.
SecureDrive provides strong encryption via the IDEA cypher (The same
symmetrical cypher used by PGP) for your files on diskettes or up to
four hard disk partitions. You encrypt your diskettes and/or HD
partitions with CRYPTDSK. Then you can access the data by using
LOGIN and SECTSR. This provides "on-the-fly" decryption (and
re-encryption) as disk sectors are accessed by your applications.
Entering LOGIN /C or powering off your PC clears the crypto keys from
memory and your encrypted disks are "instantly" secure.
Mike Ingle and I have different opinions on the distribution of
SecureDrive.  Under the GNU General License (copyleft) I do not need
Mike's permission to distribute version 1.4 and I have not asked for
same.  My policy on distribution is in the version 1.4 doc:
    Exporting this program.  Cryptography is export controlled, and
    sending this program outside the country may be illegal.  Don't do
    it.
    The "author" of versions 1.2 and 1.3, Edgar Swank, says that the
    export ban should not prevent you from placing this program on
    public BBS's and anonymous FTP sites in the US and Canada.  If
    individuals outside the US/Canada use the internet or
    international long distance to obtain copies of the program, THEY
    may be breaking US law.
    Any such foreign individuals should be aware that US law
    enforcement may legally (under US law) apprehend individuals who
    break US laws even if such individuals are not on or even have
    never been on US soil.  Such apprehension may remove such
    individuals directly to US jurisdiction without benefit of
    extradition proceedings in such individuals' home country(ies).
SecureDrive Version 1.4 is already available for download on the
following public BBS's as SECDR14.ZIP:

It has been brought to my attention that the phone number supplied to
me by Michael Paul Johnson for his Catacombs BBS which appeared here
in a previous announcement was incorrect.
The correct number is 303-772-1062.  Other information in the

@_subject: SecureDrive News - Win95 yes, Iomega zip drive no 
SecureDrive Users,
I have seen inquires here and received direct e-mail enquirinq about
SecureDrive and WIN95, and the Iomega zip disk.
I have recently heard from users that SecureDrive 1.3d does work on
Windows 95, although it does force it into "DOS Compatibility Mode",
which is a performance hit on disk access.  I've also heard that LOGIN
does not work from a WIN95 DOS window, so has to be issued outside of
I haven't heard anything specific about SecureDrive 1.4, but I believe
it should work the same as 1.3d on WIN95.
I'm sorry to report that SecureDrive does not support the Iomega ZIP
drive.  I believe that's because the TSR driver supplied with the
hardware does not support a DiskBIOS interface.
I had thought that Secure Device, another real-time encryption system,
would support this drive, since it works through a device driver
mapped to a dos file.  But an actual trial proved otherwise.  The
problem is that the DOS file must be present when the CONFIG.SYS
DEVICE= statement for the SECDEV.SYS is processed. But the zip drive
driver is a TSR that doesn't get loaded until after all DEVICE
statements have been processed.  There's no particular reason that
Iomega couldn't have written their driver as an MSDOS device driver
rather than a TSR, in which case SecureDevice would probably work, but
they didn't, so it doesn't.
Hope this info is helpful.  If any of you discover any interesting new
facts using SecureDrive, please let me know.

    >driver is a TSR that doesn't get loaded until after all DEVICE

    There are programs around that will load DOS device drivers from
    the DOS command line after booting, there's one I've used at work
    called 'DEVLOD', but I don't know if it's commercial or freeware.
    If it's free it may be possible to find it on the Net somewhere.
I found several shareware/freeware programs which claim to have this
ability. The first one I tried,
    DMC35.ZIP       74710  11-29-93  Allows loading/unloading of dev. drivers
                                     /TSR's
did the job, loading SECDEV.SYS -after- the zip drive TSR was loaded.
Other possibilities, which are present in the SIMTEL archive in
the msdos/sysutil subdirectory would be,
comp.zip         5086  08-29-88  Load and unload device drivers after bootup
devic104.zip     7250  05-30-92  Load and unload device drivers after bootup
devlod.zip      18240  12-30-91  Dynamic load of device drivers after boot-up
drvins11.zip    12298  12-06-90  Load and unload device drivers after bootup
idrv01.zip      16369  04-10-92  Install/uninstall device drivers after
                                 bootup
although I haven't tried any of these.
- From a SecureDrive user comes the following warning:
    Norton Utilities' wipeinfo appears to CORRUPT a SecureDrive (1.3d)
    partition, and well as an SFS (1.17) one.
    That was with the F-PROT (2.19) anti-virus TSR in memory
    (virstop.exe). I did not encounter problems with it off.
I think the main fault would be with virstop.  The user didn't say,
but if virstop is loaded before sectsr, that could lead to bypassing
sectsr, accessing encrypted data directly, which is likely to corrupt
the whole partition.
A user has also informed me that RAWDSK11 (or RAWDRV11) is no longer
found at
   ftp.uni-duisburg.de: /pub/pc/misc/rawdsk11.zip
This is a utility useful with SecureDrive for tape backups. Since it's
a short program, I'll include a UUENCODED image of the file here. This
program does not do cryptography by itself, so ITAR does not apply.

@_subject: SecureDrive News - Win95, non-USA ftp sites 
I have received the following information about running SecureDrive
1.4 with Win95, thanks to Ed Stone,
    This is what I sent to a person who asked how to use secdrive on
    win95......
    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>inserted text follows
    Try this:
    in your autoexec.bat file enter this, using your path to secdrive:
    C:\your-path-to-secdrive\SECTSR
    C:\your-path-to-secdrive\LOGIN your-encrypted-disk-letter: /S
    C:\your-path-to-secdrive\login your-encrypted-disk-letter:
    During normal win95 startup, you will be asked to enter your
    passphrase. Now when 95 come up, the tsr is running, your passphrase
    has been entered, and everything operates as if the disk is not
    encrypted. EXCEPT.... the tsr you have loaded (sectsr) makes windows
    load real-mode drivers for the disk, instead of protected mode
    drivers. This will make disk access somewhat slower, but not a big
    deal. When you startup win95 and you don't need to use secdrive,
    just hit enter when the boot process asks for your passphrase, and
    it will behave as if you entered a "wrong passphrase" and that drive
    will not be visible to win95, and protected mode drivers will
    load...
    Hope this helps.
In particular that the normal drivers will load even with sectsr
resident if the correct passphrase isn't entered is new and valuable
I have also just learned that SecureDrive 1.4 is now available on some
non-USA (and so not export-controlled) ftp sites,
    ftp://utopia.hacktic.nl/pub/disk/secdr14.zip
    ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/crypto/misc/secdr14.zip
I have verified that the hacktic file is an exact copy of the zip I
released in the USA.

Herb Sutter comments on Modemac's proposal,
    >     1) A person writes a message and encrypts it with PGP.
    Using a set public key?  Which would mean the remailers all share
    the same pub/pri key pair (or pieces thereof)?  You'll have to
    come up with a good way of maintaining this secret, since if
    you're not careful it could be compromised by something as simple
    as an attacker's trying to attach a new remailer to the remailer
    group or physically attack any existing remailer.
But using a shared key isn't necessary.  Each remailer can have it's
own key.  The message can be encrypted using PGP's function of
encrypting with multiple public keys.
PGP versions 2.63ui and 2.6.3i, now under development, will even have
the ability to encrypt to a whole -file- of keys, one key per line.
Message senders can use all the scanning remailer keys, or some
subset. Scanners will either skip over or forward msgs they can't
Also keep in mind that under this first layer of encryption is just
the address of another remailer, which could, in turn, either forward
to another remailer, or back to the anon newsgroup.
