We haven't heard from Peter Gutmann yet (probably because he is so busy), but
if he turns up it would be interesting to hear about any future plans for SFS.
I don't mind explaining a little bit about some areas of cryptanalysis, maybe
the various sieves. Chris might want to talk about some hardware ideas.
To try stuff out, play with programs, broadcast the nonsense worldwide over the net  ...
We don't need one, we just need people who have a common interest and something to say about it.

You would want to sign your new key with your old key wouldn't you? Anyone can add a signature to your old key, but only you can add your (old key's) signature to a new key. I agree that signing your old key with your new key is probably a good idea, as it shows that the owners of the key (the same person) trust that the keys belong to who they say they are.
