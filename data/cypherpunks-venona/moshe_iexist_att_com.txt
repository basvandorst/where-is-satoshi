Forgive me if I'm wrong, but if my memory serves me correctly, THE SPOTLIGHT is
an anti-Semitic rag; that makes every other word they publish suspect.

"Every morning you will see the wolf lying on the pasture side by
side with a sheep. The only problem is that every morning it will
be a different sheep."          -- Mohammed Wattad, M.K.
