@_subject: [NOISE/Fun] some 'special' primes 
I hope this is not extremely already know,... but, seeing on the list
a sig with someone claiming to have the 'last' prime, I played a bit
this nite and searched for the *first* alphabetically sorted prime
(once written as spelled, sorted like with unix's sort)
dependending on the language :
Easiest: English : 11 : eleven
A bit more fun : German : 811 (dunno how to write it, but it starts
with an "a")
Exotic one : slovenian: 10019 desettisocdevetnajst
And..... the tricky one, which I hope is the good one (challenge: find
one 'before') :
French (and possibly spanish/italian,...too) : 105 105 000 105 167
(it spells cent cinq mille cent cinq milliards cent cinq mille cent
soixante sept) [note that 'billion' is not used for numbers in common
language, and that soixante-dix has a - and not a space :-) ]
More languages ? better results anyone :-) ?
ps: I used gnu MP lib for my hack when I hit the 2^32 limit, but it's
rather slow... (ok, its prolly due to my lasy prime algo too, but...)
is there some well-known fast mp lib to play around with primes ?
(should I look and extract PGP's ?)

One could define some kind of new metrics let dp(x) shortest number of
hops to go from page x to any "porn" (sexy) page,
Now, I bet that dp(x) < infinity for any page x that have links on
their site that goes outside their site, thanks to the "strange

linked pages
 (mean dp) is prolly around 4 or 5
For instance, what is the pornography distance of whitehouse ? Without complete search, their dp( :

-> Executive Branch
-> government information locator service (GILS)
-> IMAGINATION NEEDED HERE!
-> [Other Topics]   {lots of remote pointers, but lots of outdated links too}
-> Another List of Internet Search facilities {netscape's search page}
Search for "playboy" for instance at infoseek, or anything in
fact... (btw where is that fast playboy's mirror ?)

Oh ? exports from Uk to Uk for instance  ??
how could it export anything without any packet crossing a "border"
even virtual ?
Maybe it violates some rules about spreading information, knowledge
of where to find 'offending' materials, but this is certainly not

I'm halfway in the coding of a simple anonymous WWW proxy, but before

 + If there is any interest
 + Chaining would be a imo good idea (ie cli <-> anonproxy1 <->
   anonproxy2 <-> ... <-> server) but how would you manage to tell

   Http-Proxy-List: anonproxy2, ...
   An alternative would be to have a database of avaibale (running)
   proxies and that the proxy itself randomly choose a next route ?
 + A way to solve previous pb and to add in encryption (but would it
   be fast enough for web browsing ?) would be that each user runs a
   local proxy (that could be optionnaly used by other folks) that
   would do pgp encryption/decryption, 'routing' selection,etc...
Would ppl with mail remailers and/or W3 experience comment ?
(or tell me the pointer toward the already solved, already implemented
beast that would do the above)

The chaining is not dynamic (but its is maybe patcheable) ? I don't think there is support for encryption (ssl patches maybe?) ?
Also, CERN httpd is a huge thing, maybe some smaller proxy would
do... My development is/could be based on my httpd, but simplified... I'll
have a look at standalone already existing proxies before reinventing

yes, they support one level of proxying, but not several as far as I
know (so chaining must be done by the proxy itself as I suggested

Reverse path is not a problem because WWW works with a bidirectional
connection, so you get the answer to you query on the same path as you
send it (its client <-> proxy1 ... (<-> and not ->))

Ok, what does it do more than cern's :

  + If you launch your personnal copy of the AnonProxyHttp with
    arguments  "port 2 ph1:pp1 ph2:pp2 ph3:pp3" and     setenv http_proxy     accessing the web now goes through your AnonProxy, which randomly

After some research on the above advertised site :    If you can talk to FIRST VIRTUAL via electronic mail, and nobody
   else can read or reply to your E-mail, then your E-mail account is
   compatible with FIRST VIRTUAL.
Wonderfull, this makes about ***nobody***
Are those folks stupid enough to think that using clear text mail is
something resonnable !!! better use even netscape 1.1 export !
(basically their 'trick' is that you send your CC# by phone, they then
give you an "id" by clear text EMAIL that allows you to shop (you and
all the folks that can intercept your mails) shopping are confirmed by
sending you a clear (!) mail, that you need to answer with "YES" "NO"
or "FRAUD" (!!) very funny system.... I imagine the poor fooled
customer bills...  Probably a lawyer devised te above statement so if
ppl get charged with thing they didn't asked for, fir$t virtual will
answer they were at fault because "someone" can read their mail (even if
the someone is the hacker around FV's mail exchanger...)

You have excellent points in your detailed answer, thank you, but
If FV was as used as SSL could be, what prevents, to use your terms,
someone to get MILLIONS of FV's identifiers and use each one only
once, etc ... (imo your figures about SSL and crypto softs risks are
over evaluated, so I over evaluate the 'risks' of yours using same
There can't be more security by transferring data on the clear
compared to an encrypted one... except maybe that people using
encryption can often feel overconfident. So, as someone pointed out,
it is not that much a problem about CC# which are available easily
anyway, but in fact, using encrypted communications is the only way to
ensure (some) *privacy*, in addition to being a security improvement. A
problem is to avoid to fail on "customer expectation", especially when
you've created it. So probably there was too much focus and
advertising on security issues on the internet, by the very same
companies that prove later to fail, giving wrong expectation. Privacy
remains a goal anyway, and financial insecurity never was a problem as
long as it remains under a small %.
So I'd prefer to use crapy netscape 1.1 40 bits export SSL than your
system... Though what I'd really use is PGP :-)
Anyway, if you have happy customers, good for you... I'd suggest that
you'd use "Security through Clarity" as motto ;-)

@_subject: Netscape Servers too ? (forwarded message from Marc VanHeyningen) 
The interesting part of this article is the discussion of random seed
weaknesses on the *server* side.  If true, this means anybody could use
the random-seed hole to reverse engineer the process by which the
server's private key information was generated and break that keypair
with much, much much less effort than would normally be needed to factor
a 512-bit RSA key.
(Note that I'm not entirely sure Netscape's server uses 512 bit RSA keys,
since the documentation, technical data sheets, and generation process
don't give any clue about what key size is being used.  Guess they don't
want customers worrying their pretty little heads about it.)
This would mean merely getting a fixed server would be insufficient; every
Netscape server user would need to generate a new keypair, get a new Verisign
certificate, and revoke the old one.
(Oops, wait, there's no way to revoke the old one.  I guess you just have to
hope nobody does this before all those certificates expire.)

sending mail to myself (not going through list processing),
via toad.com, It took 32 seconds for my host to find, contact and send
the mail to toad.com, then it took more than 5 minutes for it to come
back, and specially it came back as :
Received: from relay3.UU.NET by hplyot.obspm.fr with SMTP

So the question now is :
 "Why the toad.com send its mail through *.uu.net instead of sending
  it directly ?"
[it would/should cut at least by half the delay {at the coast of more
DNS traffic for toad.com}]
Also I suspect the long delays we sometime see comes from
toad<->uu.net interactions [besides the normal overhead of sending one
mail to thousands of people]
(the service is great anyhow)

I have *already* downloaded, checked,... pgp years ago, and I did
multiplatforms cross tests,... so all I need is a pgp signed stuff
(obviously i need your (netscape's) pgp public key too, but I think
that a "massive" distribution, that is : mail on a couple of mailing
lists, your site, newsgroup, eventually adding fingerprint by phone
for the paranoid, would ensure that your key is indeed your key (it
can probably take few weeks before it's "sure" (you'll get feedback if
key have been tempered somehow)
Or easiest even manage that your key is signed by some well known folk
See my point ?
ps :imo the later your start, the harder it'll be to be "sure" of
something. (reputation of a key takes some weeks/monthes,...)

Thanks very much for pointing out,
I don't like the fact they somehow hard wired the checksum/digest
algorithm in the keyword name, it is imo a bad idea, when you will want to
use another algorithm, also the rfc state that the checksum applies to
"canonical" form, the one I want applies to the "Content-Length" bytes
you read, whatever they are (no interpretation), and I don't like the
use of base64 which is not nice if you want to check with existing
md5,md5sum programs what you get.
I stepped meanwhile on a draft on authorization scheme using digest, which might be interesting... when implemented client side... more on
this later (ref:
see also
for a "mediated digest" authentification/security scheme)

I'm about to implement an OTPasswd (mostly like s/key) scheme to my
www browsers/clients/proxy, but I was wondering is the mere principle
of storing H^n(S) and requesting H^(n-1) from peer (H beeing your
favorite one way strong hash function (MD5), and S your seed+secret
passwd) could possibly be patented somehow and thus preventing using a
similar scheme without getting a license (from
bellcore?),.... if there are any usage conditions/restrictions?,... Also, can one compute the amount of information (if any) leaked by the
method, ie, an attacquant who would have all the
H^i  i={a...b}  (by snooping for instance) would have is job easied,
and by 'how much' to find S? (or H^a-1)  . is there any studies on
that for H=MD[45] ? (and what is the status of free use of MDx btw ?)
ps: I just an a thought that maybe the last P in elementrix POTP would
be Passwd and not Pad... it could still be quite interesting to have
H^n(S) (maybe variant with large n) used has 'secret' keys between
parties, you'll get lots of plus against standard attacks, provided
that there is no problem with know the function H^n for several
(possibly large) n... hmmm why this hasn't been implement ? what
obvious flaw am I missing ?

They always did that, without even giving away T-shirt since they

There are/were a couple of small problems with the ecash software, but
no money is lost, as long as you have a consistent file system
[and I think they are working on an "auto recovery/auto cancel"
note that there are some problems, initially the proposed shop

get the system better, maybe it is a bit too early for real bank
also... I think some bugs are still hanging around... but the idea is

ps : I have no interest in digicash whatsoever except being partipant

account ;-)  I wish they give prices to 'good' shops ;-0)}

I've waited a bit, but as nobody seem to have pointed out, you can
definitly find a unique stream in a *single* pass (but maybe what you
really want is no pass at all ?)
{you add a new random byte each time you find your sequence in the

ps: it would be easier that the game is legal so ppl can play without
being hidden... In my current casino, most people do complain when
there is a problem, and I think that those who don't aren't because
its monopoly money or just they aren't paying much attention...

You can use my anonymous proxy which strips off all 'personal'
informations, including User-Agent: ...
While I let Mozillas access it :-)

Yes Netscape got the authorisation to sell Netscape navigator in
France (40 bits) but there is no policy changes or whatever, it is
still a tedious product by product process to get auth for crypto and
obviously, you'rent going to get an auth for PGP any real soon... :-(

Netscape still had this bug in late 0.9x beta versions (that you still
got plenty of url encoded passwords early last year)
Lynx had it at least up to 2.3.7,
