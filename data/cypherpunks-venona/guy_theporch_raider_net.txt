I'm new to the list and this may be a dumb question, but what is currently
being done in the area of digital money?  Anything?

To me at least this seems unimportant for the application.  If all you're
doing is exchanging session keys over the phone, it doesn't really matter if
you are sure that the public key actually belongs to who it claims it does,
only that the person you're talking to (who you presumably already know)
actually possesses the corresponding private key.  This can be verified with
a simple challenge-response system.  The identity problem is removed if you
use a different key pair for phone conversations than you do for signature
purposes... there doesn't need to be any information actually connecting the
key with you.

I read the NYT article, which was on the second page of the business section
in Monday's edition.  Apparently the patent was granted to a Virginia
company (don't recall the name, and that may be the wrong state... )
and covers virtually anything that provides ATM-like functionality from a
home computer.  The exact boundaries of the patent weren't discussed in the
article, but I seriously doubt it would affect a digital cash system.
