Sure, it is duplicative.  However, for this thing to become law, I envision a rather dramatic shift in the organization of our intelligence institutions.  Or at least a change in some of the building names at Ft. Meade :)
There is an exective order or presidential decision directive (pdd) from the mid-80's that formalizes a "relationship" between the NSA and FBI for law enforcement decryption.  However, I never was able to get my hands on it ...

I don't dispute you -- in the slightest -- that a brute force attack against a 2000-bit RSA key is functionally impossible today.  However, I don't think that a brute force attack is the most likely for a functional law enforcement (or national security) crypto lab.  Unless you think that today's algorithms and conventional random number generators are perfect Aaron

and the technical realities of encryption, plus the limitations of any "NETCenter," will force a respect for, or at least compliance with, the 4th amendment.  Hooray!

Ultimately, we are not going to "trick" them.  Congress has tools, like CRS, that ensure that they (usually) have good information before a bill is sent to the President.
However, why shouldn't we provide cover for them?  You can be sure that Oxley, McCain, Kerrey, etc. will receive "cover" from the FBI and Law Enforcement.  You can be sure that they will receive endorsements from all of the right "fraternal brotherhood of police whatever" organizations come election time.
If a Member of Congress wants to support civil rights, I think that we *should* provide as much support and "cover" as possible.  It's hard enough to publically support civil rights and free speech in today's media We won yesterday because the Committee found a solution that gave them cover and allowed all parties to declare victory.  I find that to be a very good thing.
