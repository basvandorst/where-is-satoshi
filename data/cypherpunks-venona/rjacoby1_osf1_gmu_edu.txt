@_subject: Re: GAK boycott, What are legal implications? 
Gee, being legally responsible for lost revenue over a boycott.  Rev. Donald Wilmond is going to be very broke!  I don't know anything about the NAACP case, but it seems to me that free speech & merely *urging* people to boycott would be a perfect defense.
