@_subject: Re: Password Difficulties 
I have actually tried memorizing truly random passwords of 8 characters or longer (generated with a paranoid program similar to PGP 2.6's excellent technique).  I've found that if I review it enough, that I find patterns and mnemonic clues in such passwords that help me to remember them.  I don't imagine too many people will go through that effort, so I still think that a longer pass phrase that sort of "makes sense" is better for a PGP key.  Still, I do use the truly random passwords on publicly accessible Unix systems like CSN, since that makes dictionary attacks improbable.

@_subject: Re: Request: tamper-proofing executables 
There are lots of ways to detect modification of executable code, and possibly take some action based on the outcome.  The hard part comes when you consider that the code doing the checking may itself be hacked.  A determined hacker would just patch the code to jump around the test.  I suggest three things to make it harder:`
1.  Make more than one test in more than one place in the code, making it harder to find all of them.
2.  If you use any embeded keys, create them at run time from pieces stored in different places in the code and/or data.
3.  Store the code in compressed format.  One nice way to do this is with PKLite Professional with the -e option.
The choice of algorithms used to sign the files (i. e. DSA vs RSA vs salted hash vs simple CRC) is probably less important than the details mentioned above.  The only way to substantially increase the security of the check is to add a hardware device (i. e. dongle or custom hardware card), but people generally hate those since they are usually used just for copy protection.  On the other hand, clever application of the above software techniques is probably good enough to avoid common virii, unintentional damage to files, and the average hacker.
Peace to you.

@_subject: Re: Security for under a buck fifty 
I already do this -- except that I use a keystroke- timing program for the true random source, and I do the mnomonic generation with my brain instead of the program.  My program just converts the random numbers to uniformly distributed printable ASCII (values between space and del), for a little more entropy than 6 bits per character.
A more automated way to generate a pass phrase might be to convert every 16 bits of random numbers to one of 65536 words and names in your favorite languages.  That way, you would have real words to memorize, but in a strange order.  For example, a 128 bit key might be:
tree elephant action roof xymurgy eight top slash.
You could try to think of some story to link the 8 originally unrelated words together and help you to remember it.

@_subject: Re: Gov't eyes public-key infrastructure 
I agree.  The web of trust still allows for key certification by some central authority -- but I get to choose which central authorities I wish to believe (and pay for).

Good point.  I prefer the )*&^$!(~ stuff in there, but some may not.
Good idea.

Or for the rabid, clinically paranoid:
3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | 3des | tran | IDEA | tran | Diamond | tran | Blowfish | prngxor | ... about 500 more lines of the same ...
with a memorized 5 megabyte key.
And I thought 15 round Diamond with a 256 bit key was overkill worse than 3 key triple DES!
Seriously, folks, the weakest links of most cryptosystems are not in the symmetric key cipher (provided you pick one of the good ones), but in the key management, associating people with keys, and in picking good pass Peace to you.

@_subject: Re: Triple encryption... 
Naturally, the two aren't mutually exclusive, but I'll not buy a vault door for my house unless I've got a vault to put it on.
Anyway, I think the best key management so far is the PGP web of trust design of Phil Zimmermann's.  I think this could be extended for other applications, too, like encrypted IP (swIPe?) and the like.  I've been trying to think of ways to extend that to private key systems, too.
Peace to you.

@_subject: Re: thoughts on RC4 
Don't forget the precomputation attack.  The key setup only has to be done
2^40 times, ever.  The initial state of the stream cipher can be stored on
a set of tapes that are read in parallel to perform the brute force
attack.

@_subject: Re: DOS - MD5 - Thanks 
A freestanding implementation of MD5SUM (compiled from that in the PGP distribution) for DOS is at
ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/public/md5sum.zip and on the Colorado Catacombs BBS at 303-772-1062.
I suggested to Phil Zimmermann that he should put this in the next PGP release along with the compiled DOS version of PGP, but there hasn't been a new release of PGP since then.
Happy New Year!
