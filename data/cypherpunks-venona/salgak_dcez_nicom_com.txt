@_subject: Re: Scoring Politicians on Digital Liberty Issues (Re: Net Politics) 
Suggestions, based on the successful ratings concept I've seen in Virginia elections, and a mainstay of groups like the Borg, excuse me, the Christian Coalition Pick 10-20 issues/votes.  Rate each congresscritter AND THEIR OPPONENTS based on "our" stand on the issues. Give a numerical score, based on percentage of "correct" positions.
Obvious issues are:
digital telephony   the CDA  Encryption/PRO-CODE  copyright, etc. . .
