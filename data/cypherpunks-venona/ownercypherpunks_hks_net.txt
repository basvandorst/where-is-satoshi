You continue to confuse (deliberately?) a community with the place it meets.
"List" is being used in two senses -- and you continue to interpret it only
as the instance of majordomo on toad.com.  That's a worthless interpretation
as nobody disputes that Eric controls that agent.
As far as I'm concerned, if a message has gone out to every address on
the "cypherpunks" list, I don't give a shit whether or not it went through
toad.com first: it went to cypherpunks.

No longer.  I removed this last night, since MUAs don't agree on what they do with "Reply-To:".
(The behavior I was trying to encourage is that of following up only to
 the list.  Netcom lossage notwithstanding, I hate being CC'd on things
 that I'll see anyway.)

Actually, I've been using the "From " line in the UNIX mail file,
as it's the "envelope" address.  But that's because the system I built
on top of was an infobot.  I'll change it to just pass the "From: " header along from the input.
Sorry 'bout that.

@_author: so that no information would be contained in the signature 
@_subject: Re: Cypherpunks@hks.net service 
Not exactly;  that's how the thought train began, but something that was
just for circumventing the rule would have a slightly different solution:
generate a new key for each post, sign with the key, and throw it away
(so that no information would be contained in the signature).  The
signatures from the current system does contain some information.
I might yet still implement something that does the above: at this point,
it's pretty trivial, aside from hacking PGP to generate a key with a smaller
than 384-bit modulus (to conserve computrons).
As an aside, this is my general approach to things: I'll start off in
a particular direction and then vary it as I think of new things.  I
only mention it here because I often state that I'm going to do something
and then the result is somewhat different than my original summary. I've done this a couple times here, and I'm hoping that explaining this
will make me appear, well, less flakey.

Somewhat, yes.  As the aesthetics are important to me (which is why
I avoid MIME as a rule), I'll avoid doing a MIME-compliant solution
until MIME is integrated better with MUAs.  Which in practice means
that until it's part of emacs/vm, since that's what I use.  I'm not currently concerned that the separation be computer-parsable,
as long as it's human-parsable.
