@_subject: gnutar + pgp filter mode 
The gnu tar archiver allows to use an arbitrary
compression program (option --use-compress-program=PROG).
This works well with pgp if a small wrapper is used:
 -fb
if ("$1" == "-d") then
  exec pgp -d -f
  exec pgp -e -f
The only problem is that this doesn't work well for
larger amounts of data, because pgp reads in all
data before starting with its work.
Perhaps a future release of pgp will have a real filter
BTW: Does this "crypto-hook" cause export restrictions to apply on gtar ?
