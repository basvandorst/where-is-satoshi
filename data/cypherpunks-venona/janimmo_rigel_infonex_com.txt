I'm going to take a wild stab in the dark and say that this is
a forged e-mail address.
Well, I for one hope he doesn't just mean forging the "From:"
header like he did above.
"Guarantee?" I didn't think that was possible. I know it's possible
to make it so difficult to read your mail that it wasn't worth the
Well, if he's for real (which I doubt), and he gives detailed
instructions for the newbie on how to set up PGP on all
platforms, Premail, Mixmaster, the nym servers, the anonymizer,
etc., then it might be worth it to some people. However, I found
that doing it the hard way (trial and error), was not only
cheaper, but helped me understand the programs better.
I hope he's not referring to the nym servers, as they aren't
real accounts.
I wonder if it might just be a case of:
"Okay, here's your PGP FAQ, nym FAQ, Mixmaster FAQ, Anonymity
FAQ, and anonymizer URL. Thanks for the twenty bucks! See ya'!"
But what about all the evil postman who are just waiting for
you to send your credit card number through the mail? And I thought
he was concerned about our security?
What's he copyrighting? His e-mail message or his credit
card form?
