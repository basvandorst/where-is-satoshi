No, got three myself.  The third did seem a little different from the first two though, but I didn't study them that closely.

@_subject: Re: Why can't I get PGP from MIT 
I have sent two requests myselt in the last two months that have gone unanswered.  The request was to have isdn.net added to the allowed list.  I know the initial rejection was the .net domain, but the location should not be hard to look up - just a basic whois.  I got PGP from alternative locations, but still have not been able to get PGPhone.
