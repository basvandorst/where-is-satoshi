Actually, there seems to be a screw up out  there.
Right now, one can go down the 7/11, and pay cash for a prepaid cellphone, and renew it with cellphone time cards also purchased with cash.
No paperwork, NONE.
I have one.
While all of the technology applies, and certainly it is possible
to determine things by analyzing calling habits, I can't see how one
can easily determine who has cellphone  when you just bought a box at an out of town 7/11 during the breakfast
rush with cash.
Esp if one doesn't make a lot of calls.

Where possible, fuk a bunch of airlines anyway.
Travel by train is a lot more enjoyable, relaxing, fun.
Folks that travel by train could fly, but would
preferr to enjoy the ride, cause it ain't no cheaper, except, !!
you can pay with cash and show no id and go
where you would like in the lower 48.

I've taken that same route, except up to no. Vermont rather than RI,
I travelled anonymously, for an extra 50 bux, I had my own little private cabin, I was never
searched, my bags were never xrayed by incompetent
androids, was able to find company from the hordes that you describe to sit with me in my
lil cabin and spend some time (wink wink, nudge
nudge) and so forth. yeah, an entire day spent with a whole pile of folks can really be a horrible drag, and I'm
told that travelling on the weekends thats
what you can expect. But, shuffling in and out of Polizei Central, subjecting myself to xrays and potential cavity searches, showing ID to every bone
head that demands it, just seems a little
too kyrstalnachtish for my taste, I don't care
if I EVER fly again. Its easier, less hassle, more anonymous to
travel by train than it is to drive, or
for that matter, walk.
yes, its VERY easy for the SS
to stop and search a train, but the plane is a forgone situation. By entering an
airport, you've already consented to be
stripped of nearly every right you thought
you may have had.
I had an experience like you describe travelling
from Atlanta to DC by bus once when a young-un. I too, swore I'd never do it again, and I didn't,
not till I mustered out of the military and they
stuck me on a 10 hr busride to the nearest
depot to go home, and yes, I still hated it.
to each his own, take care

Thats the most interesting POV I've ever heard
of in these discussions, seems like for the most part, we counter fear arguments with other fear arguments,
Never saw this before. Bears more examination.

Well, Sorry, I don't mean to sound pollyanneish, thats not my point.
Its just a point of view I had never heard expressed before, and
I thought it was interesting. Fighting fear with more fear isn't working. Its just that simple, a different approach I think is worthy of investigation. thats all
