@_subject: Q's on Number Theory/Quadriatic Residues 
I've been trying to get myself up to speed on some of the protocols in
_Applied_Cryptography_ and my woeful lack of number theory is showing through
crystal clear.
While a course on number theory is in the works for the fall, right now, I'm
of curious and would appreciate any sort of response I can get to the following questions from those of you to whom number theory is not as much of a stranger.
1)In AC on page 293 in the section on the Feige-Fiat-Shamir, there is a chart which lists the residues, their inverses and their square roots, all
35.  The chart, which I have reproduced below, baffles me--at least the part for the square roots:
                 -1             -1
        v       v         sqrt(v  )
         1       1               1
         4       9               3
         9       4               2
         11      16              4
         16      11           ***9
         29      29           ***8
***How are these square roots?  9 is certainly not the square root of 11, nor is
8 the square root of 29, even modulo 35.  2)By the same token, on the previous pages Schneier uses the expression
        (1/v), which I take to mean "the quantity one divided by the value                                                    -1
        of v", while the example expresses it as (v  ) which I take to         mean "the inverse of v."  Are these two expressions interchangeable
        or is this something that I should have found in the errata?
3)Speaking of errata, where can I find a copy?
4)Now, going back to the number theory, I've got a few more questions re:
        a)On page 293, the residues are listed as, "the possible quadriatic
        Is it possible to predict the possible quadriatic residues, or is an
        search of the values from on the interval [1,n] necessary to find the         quadriatic residues of modulo n?
5)From what does Feige-Fiat-Shamir derive its security?  Obviously not
discrete logs,
but I'm not sure I understand the protocol sufficiently to be able to see
where it derives its security.
To those of you who aren't interested, thanks for reading so far, and with
this we
return you to your regularly scheduled conspiracy rants, personal attacks,
and other random nonsense.  To those of you who can respond, any assistance is

Has anyone sucessfully compiled PGP with AIX v.4 on an IBM RS6000?
If so, please mail me, as I'm trying to install it sucessfully.

  The algorithm is very simple and a simple inspection of this file should
  be sufficient for most people to figure out whats going on.
  Feel free to copy this as you please, as long as you include this
  message with it.
  If you use this, please send me mail and tell me what its used
  for--I'd be somwhat curious.
  If there are any questions, feel free to mail me and ask me.
  USAGE:
  trmpbrk    Definitions:
  BASE:
  Base is a trumpwsk.ini file in which you have inputted "000000000000" into
  the ppp-username box in the File/PPP Options/Username menu in Trumpet
  Winsock.  Don't forget to rename this to something other than
  trumpwsk.ini(something like "0")
  I've included my copy of base, but every version/revision of
  Trumpet Winsock changes it, so I would recommend you do this yourself.
  PASS:
  This is the file that you want to decrypt the value for.  Most of the time
  it will be trumpwsk.ini.
  Example:
  trmpbrk 0 trumpwsk.ini

Why bother to degauss it--why not just let it "rest" too long on those demagnetizing pads they use at department stores and libraries to demagnetize the security strips?

Point of information--I'm not flaming you Perry, but Public Key Partners claims that their patent covers all forms of Public Key Crypto.

I'm not so convinced that adding 'firewall functionality' to an OS is such a good idea.  The idea behind having a firewall is that When you start trying to swtich firewall functionality to an OS you lose both these advantages.  You no longer have a system that is stripped of compilers, scripting languages, etc, and you now have a much larger security perimeter.

@_subject: Re: IPSEC == end of firewalls 
Because this has Cpunks relevance in the use of crypto, I'm going to keep it on this list...
But what does it mean to add 'firewalling capabilities' to an O/S?  By definition, a firewall is supposed to stop the spread of 'fire' by being the sole mechanism for the interchange of packets.
If you're referring to making a hardened OS that can protect itself through the use of well written code, memory protections, etc. then, yes by all means add it to your OS, but these shouldn't be luxuries in that they're thought of as 'firewalling' features.  Rather these things should be compulsory in the development of OS's.
Even if OS's could be secure(lets not get into Orange Book here) they would need constant updating.  Most users have problems printing, let alone installing patches and tweaking afterwards to deal with conflicts.  And you can't expect IS to micromanage the corporation's entire fleet of This would be nice, and would be a good start, but like I said above, these things shouldn't be considered to be luxuries.  Rather they should be compulsory.  That doesn't mean that they will obsolete firewalls by any stretch of the imagination.
(I'm starting to think Frank may have been right to move this to firewalls.  I think I'll crosspost this message too)
