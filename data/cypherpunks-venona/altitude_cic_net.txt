Wouldn't there still be licensing issues to deal with (in the states at
least)??  I'm sure RSA would claim that the package would be in violation
of the licensing...
(this doesn't mean i'm not all for it.  I only wish i was outside of the
states to help... :(

Yeah, this would work for everyone except commercial institutions within
the states.  They'd have to get a license agreement for RSA.

are you sure that this is a commerce server?  Last I saw, It was only the
Communications server (doesn't have SSL).  I could be wrong though.

After following the threads that have gone on after the SSL/RC4 cracking, It seems that we are going about this all wrong.  The cypherpunks and
Netscape shouldn't be at odds about this event.  It would be in everyone's
best interest to join forces against the common foe (ITAR), and try to
prove to the feds that RC4-40 just plain isn't good enough.  For example, if Netscape (or someone else) were to issue a challenge to
break an SSL Key as fast as possible, and then the cypherpunks did just
that in say...a few hours, it could make a very big statement.  It seems that one of the problems with Damien's cracking job was that it
was "not sanctioned".  Look at the WSJ article, they didn't mention his
name...they just called him "a hacker".  It shows how public opinion still
sees groups like the cypherpunks as just that, a bunch of punks. With some "respected" business on our side, it may make a much bigger
impact (better publicity, better leverage, etc.).
Maybe i'm just dreaming...

It seems that the SKSP protocol is a good foundation for just such a plan.
Can screensavers such as After Dark for mac/pc access network protocols?  or would someone have to write a new screensaver alltogether.

It would probably be best to have the "child" servers requeset large
chunnks of keyspace from a "parent" server.  This may require some minimal
extension to the protocol.  In particular, in the helo, you may want to
add a "client type" field which would be either "Client" or "Server".  If
it's a "Server" the parent server would keep track of the name/ip of the
"child" server.  If someone tried to ack a set of keyspace that the "child"
server was responsible for, the "parent" server would return either a or perhaps a new return code  such as
The 602 code would differ from the 601 code stop in that the client could
come back to either server in the future.
This would let a real "Client" could request keys from any server, but would have to ack back to the same server.
When the "child" server runs out of keyspace, it would get some more from
it's "parent" server.  Just my $0.02.

Yes.  This has been done.  A set of patches for NCSA's HTTPd (for US folks only) can be found at
I got the patches from the ssleay gang in AU, but i haven't seen them on
their ftp site yet, so if you're outside the states, it'll be available
rsn (i think...)
Well, I have been trying for the last 3 months to put together a "free"
WWW server to both commercial and non-commercial institutions in the
states (I'm only concerned about people in the states for now because most
of the important issues are moot if you're outside of the states).
The main problems that I've run into are:
   * Crypto is a difficult topic to understand:
       I didn't know anything about crypto when i started.  It's taken me
       this long to start understanding the fundamental concepts and such.
       And i'm still really in the dark about a lot of it.
   * Specific information about crypto, (especially licensing and other
     legal stuff) is difficult to find.
       Since there are so many patents/trade secrets regarding crypto
       libraries/algorithms/protocols, any developer MUST deal with the
       corresponding companies.  That process is long and painful.
   * Money
       There are bound to be legal problems, for example, the RC4
       situation.  According to everything I've heard, it is legal to use
       RC4 because it doesn't have trade secret status anymore.
       Unfortunately, RSA will most likely bring suit to anyone who tries.     * ITAR
       'Nuff said.
As for my plan to "provide" a ssl'ized web server, my plan is to put
together a "package" which contains NCSA's HTTPd, SSLeay, and a version of
RSARef.   I would only charge whatever the licensing costs were to me
(There's a minimum $20 cost for the commercial RSARef from Consensus, and
I'm still working on the RC4 licensing).
Oh yeah, one other problem is that companies like RSA are completely
unaccustomed to dealing with people providing "free" products.  For
example, At first, RSA kept asking me for a "Business Plan" so that we
could work out a percentage royalty that I would pay them for RC4
licensing.  They were completely aghast when i said that I wanted to
provide it for free.  The pointed me to RSARef, but i told them that i
wanted to provide it for commercial institutions too, so they asked for
business plan, and the cycle continued....  (I've started working with
them again, so things are progressing for now...).  I know that I don't
really have to go through the RC4 licensing with RSA, but i don't have the
money to buy dinner, let alone go head to head with RSA in court.
anyway, if y'all are interested, more info can be found at
  I'd be happy to
answer questions, but seeing the knowledge level on the cp list, i feel
sort of inferior.

Hi.  This is a pretty intresting statement.  Does this mean that RSA acknowledges the fact that RC4 can no longer claim
"Trade Secret" status, and therefore will stop trying to make people get a
license to use RC4?
