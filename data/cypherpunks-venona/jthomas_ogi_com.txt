(Noted by several others, too)
Sorry about this!  The Windows NT client asked "how many keys" I wanted to
check, not how many key segments.  50,000 sounded like a few seconds' work
on my P120.  I've attempted to return the keys using the "reject" button
(again on the Win32 client), but I don't think it took.  If anyone can tell
me what the quickest way to return these keys is, I'd really appreciate it.
Sorry, all,
Joe Thomas

You're right, I asked (I thought) for 50,000 keys -- a couple seconds' work
on my machine -- and got back 50,000 segments.  The WinNT client thinks it's
sent them back, but the web page still lists them as mine.  I can't find a
form on Adam's web site for sending back keys, either.
Please do, if you can!
