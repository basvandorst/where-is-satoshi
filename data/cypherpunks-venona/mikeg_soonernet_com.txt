Hey guys,
I'm hoping that you guys can point me in the right direction.  I have become
very interested in the idea of an encrypted file system, rather than encrypting
individual files.  I read an article in the Linux Journal that talked about how
to give Linux the support.  Well, first I had to get the source for an older
kernel, 2.0.30, and use the patches.  It patched and compiled fine. Next I was
supposed to patch mount.  The problem I am facing is that the mount source will
not take the patch right.  If anyone can help me on these two issues I would be very happy:
1) What source version of mount do I need to use?
2) Is there a way to get kernel 2.0.35 or later to use this support?

Thanks!  I appreciate the quick response.  Where can I get CFS?
