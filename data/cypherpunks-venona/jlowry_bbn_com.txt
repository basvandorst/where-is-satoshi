Not to toot my own horn, but take a look at
 for a free ASN.1 to C++ compiler that runs on
solaris 1 and 2 and has been ported (with relatively little effort)
to Windows.  Free for non-commercial use.  Commercial use terms
have unrestricted rights for runtime.

Oh please ...
As you point out, physics is not optional.  This is predictable and was
predicted.  Yawn.
I predict that 3DES will fall too - actual time it takes is left to the
More interesting, how about a supposition that DNA computers will be able
to factor
interesting numbers within 5 years ?  Does that make certain other
algorithms into snake-oil ?
At the heart of this is the idea that "strong" cryptography is a fixed and
set over time and that a change in that set will result in a change in the
policy restricting export.  It doesn't necessarily follow.  Lobbying is
Perhaps all that happens is that DES now joins the crowd of exportable
algorithms :-)
One lesson I plan to observe - don't encrypt known plaintext unless you
have to !
