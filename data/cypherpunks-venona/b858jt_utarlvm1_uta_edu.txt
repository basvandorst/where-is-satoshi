Pat Farrell and others have been discussing hardware random-number
generators.  Since I've built such devices, I thought I'd put in my
I used a reverse-biased transistor junction for the noise source.  The
noise is amplified by a three-stage op-amp circuit with about 60 dB of
voltage gain in the passband and a 3-dB bandwith of 10 Hz - 3 KHz.
A spectrum analyzer shows the noise is random, with no frequencies standing
out more than others.
The analog noise feeds an op-amp comparator wired as a zero-crossing
detector.  The output is a logic level which switches randomly, but on
average, on and off about 50% of the time, respectively.  This logic level
gates a 5 MHz TTL oscillator, producing bursts of pulses of random length.
These pulses are counted by an 8-bit counter, producing random 8-bit
numbers.  The outputs of the counter are latched and read through a PC
bi-directional parallel port.  Allowing the slowest changing bit to turn
over 10 times between samples suggests a maximum sampling rate of 1000
The chi-square test and the runs tests on these samples show very good
statistical properties.  For large samples (> 100,000 bytes), there seems
to be a slight predominance of "one" bits (e.g.  0.6% difference).  This is
probably due to some factor in the sampling process which I haven't figured
out yet.  Anyway, exclusively-or'ing successive samples together removes
this bias.  I'd appreciate any ideas about this.
I don't know what practical use this device has, except for those who need
one-time pads, but it was fun to hack up and test.

@_subject: Hardware RNG's 
Perry Metzger asks if the hardware random-number generator I
described in a post just before the list crashed could be
modified to use serial output.
Sure.  It was just easier to use the parallel port.  I know
the original IBM PC stupidly omitted bidirectional ports,
but they are available now.
Roger Bryner asks if there is any ready-made hardware RNG
Yes.  A few years ago, at least, AT&T was selling such a
chip.  The data book says:
"The T7001 Random Number Generator (RNG) integrated circuit
produces random bits based on the phase jitter of a free-
running oscillator.  The output data stream is truly random,
not pseudo random.  The T7001 RNG is processed in CMOS
technology, requires a single 5 V supply, and is supplied in
a 32-pin plastic DIP."
The output is 536-bit numbers, available in 8-bit bytes.
There are probably others available; I haven't looked

Roger, I would like some details about your hardware RNG, if you
could, including how you were reading the random value.  I had the
impression you were taking one bit at a time.
What did you mean when you said:  "I just got a 3 standard deviation
at a 1000000 sample..."?  What statistical testing did you do?
I used the chi-square test on 8-bit values (255 degrees of freedom),
and also computed the probablility for the chi-square statistic.  I
programmed the runs-up and runs-down tests as suggested by Knuth, and
computed the chi-square for those as well.  Finally, I counted the
numbers of 1 and 0 bits, and the number of times 1 followed 0, 0
followed 1, etc.
I didn't do the autocorrelation test.  If you have any code for that,
I would appreciate having it.  I'm not sure what you mean by "...the
derevitives of the sequence..."  What is that?
I suppose these gadgets could be useful for those who want the
absolute security of the one-time pad, and can exchange disks
securely.  With disks holding 1.44 meg now, it could be practical.

@_subject: Validating IDEA 
Does anyone know if there is a validation suite for the IDEA
cipher?  I want to be able to verify an implementation on
the TMS320 digital-signal processor.
The NIST has such a test suite for the DES, but I haven't heard
anything about IDEA.
