@_subject: My only words on "Electromagnetic Pulse" Damage 
Much discussion this morning about EMP, electromagnetic pulse weapons, HERF
guns, Winn Schwartau's "Information Warfare" scenarios, TEMPEST, etc.
Not closely related to Cypherpunks themes, but lots of speculation is
continuing. I happen to know a fair amount about chip vulnerability to
various kinds of radiation and electrostatic discharge, and have had
contacts with folks who know Schwartau. (I was also interviewed for a
Schwartau-oriented BBC television program called "The I-Bomb.")
Here's what I know:
* EMP can of course zap devices. High electric field gradients can induce
voltage drops that blow inputs, burn out circuits, etc. Lots of mechanisms
for this, of course. Latch-up in CMOS circuits, field oxide overvoltage
breakdown, etc. There is an entire sub-industry devoted to electrostatic
discharge (ESD), with conferences, products, consulting services, etc.
* However, getting the voltages coupled into circuits is another matter.
Modern chips can usually handle static charge buildups that are in the tens
of thousands of volts range (input protection devices are on the input
pads). Static discharge should be avoided (wrist straps, etc.), but most
modern devices will survive the static discharges that folks can generate.
* The point? A _distant_ (tens of meters away) source of electromagnetic
fields will have a pretty hard time of creating field gradients able to
equal these 10,000 volt local fields caused routinely by static buildup.
(Electric fields are of course measured in terms of "volts per meter"...do
the math.)
* The traditional EMP work is well-covered in each year's "Nuclear and
Space Radiation Effects Conference," the Proceedings of which are included
in the December issue each year of "IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science
and Space Radiation Effects." I advise anyone interested in this topic to
consult these sources. (I've been to a few of these conferences, beginning
in 1978.)
* Most of the traditional EMP work is oriented toward the detonation of
nukes in orbit, where the interaction of the photons from the bomb with
electrons in the upper atmosphere create an electromagnetic field of
millions of volts per meter, the so-called "electromagnetic pulse" that
blows circuits. (This effect was apparently first noticed, by U.S.
scientists at least, after a 1962 high altitude burst over Johnson Atoll in
the Pacific, with electric circuits as far away as Hawaii being blown.)
* Schwartau has not, to my knowledge, ever seen a direct demonstration of
the effects he is describing in his book. In fact, much of his "HERF gun"
stuff is admittedly speculative.
* He has gotten interest from British intelligence (MI-5 or MI-6, not sure
which) in his "scenarios" for knocking out financial centers with EMP bombs
and HERF guns. A friend of mine, who can speak up if he wishes here, has
had some contacts with Schwartau and may have started to do some
preliminary experiments on this stuff.
(The EMP/HERF folks in governments have of course a lot of experience here.
I'm just saying that the "Schwartau crowd" appears to just be getting
started on actual experiments, so any speculations in "Information Warfare"
should be taken as just that, as speculations.)
* As a matter of commenting on one thread about damage to the "HERF gun"
itself, the conventional notion is that such a device would be a "set and
forget" device, with a suitcase planted near a corporate office complex and
set to "detonate" some time later. All the talk about reuse and damage to
the operator is beside the point. (As is the speculation about effects on
the human  body....bodies can withstand incredibly high fields, so long as
a ground path for current does not form (electrocution)....I could go on
about this, but won't.)
* In my opinion, Schwartau's chief interest is in spreading fear and
concern about the "vulnerability" of the world's "information
infrastructure." This cranks up interest in his book, in getting talk show
interviews, etc. He may have "patriotic" motives as well, but I think a
large part of what we're seeing is the usual, and increasingly common,
journalistic hype.
This is not to say there is no basis for concern, just that this is not the
first and foremost concern. After, cutting power lines has long been an
easy way to knock out economic activity--it may have recently happened in
Penang, Malaysis, for example, where many chip assembly plans were knocked
off-line for a few weeks by a power cable cut.
This is all I'll say on the current debate on TEMPEST, HERF, EMP, etc.

@_subject: Crisis Overload (re Electronic Racketeering) 
Folks, I'm not going to exhort you to fight this latest travesty, to send
angry letters to your senators and representatives.
Every couple of months there's been a new legislative attack on what were
once basic American freedoms. (Sorry to focus on America. I'm sure you
folks in the liberty-loving paradises of, say, Germany, are gloating over
our hand-wringing.)
We're losing the war. We can send in donations to the NRA and EFF, offer
our support to the ACLU and EPIC, but the tide just keeps rolling in,
washing away our efforts. The full-time lawmakers in D.C. can proliferate
new repressive laws much faster than we can fight them.
Our focus on this list has been on crypto, and crypto is finally coming
under the massive assault we knew would come from the earliest rumblings
several years ago about "key escrow." Clipper was the warning shot, the
current "War on the Internet" (fed by scare stories and hysteria) is part
of the propaganda war, and now this bipartisan bill to expand the RICO Act
to include any non-GAK implementation of crypto is the nail in the coffin.
No wonder Stu Baker and Ron Lee were so smug at the last CFP.
Ordinary lobbying is probably a lost cause. The EFF tried to "work with"
the government (Administration, Congress) on the Digital Telephony Bill,
and got rolled (in the opinion of many, even in the governing circles of
This latest assault is probably unstoppable. The co-sponsorship by Sen.
Leahy, once seen as an ally of the EFF (recall the attempts to get the
Leahy alternative to Exon adopted), and the enthusiastic support of
Republicans, Democrats, and the intelligence community means that GAK is
Oh, and the use of RICO and "conspiracy" in such a central way fulfills
Whit Diffie's prediction of a few years ago that the main way crypto will
be controlled is through such laws, by spreading fear, uncertainty, and
doubt amongst users and corporations. Make the corporations so paranoid
that they'll crack down on employees, adopt GAK methods, and freeze out the
"street corner user" of crypto.
(If the only users of PGP and other non-GAK tools are fringe groups and
underground communities, then the main goals will have been achieved. The
public use of PGP will have been squelched, the public use of anonymous
cash will have been suppressed, and the social control goals will have been
achieved. )
I think it's time to abandon all lobbying efforts...they don't appear to be
working, and the government is proliferating new laws faster than we can
fight them.
The only hope is to more rapidly deploy crypto, to reach the "point of no
return." Optimistically, we may already be there (the views expressed by
many of us). Pessimistically, the application of RICO laws and civil
forfeiture could put any of us who advocate crypto use and evasion of the
new laws into a precarious position.
This is enough to say for now.
Suffice it to say I view the latest Grassley proposed legislation to be the
culmination of the past several years worth of anti-liberty legislation. A
much bigger threat than Clipper.
In fact, it's what many of us saw implicit in Clipper.

@_subject: Re: Fight, or Roll Over? 
I'd hardly call my view "throwing in the towel." What I said clearly enough
was that the Washingtonians can throw out repressive legislation much
faster than we can--and I speak in terms of "we" as being the EFF, EPIC,
NRA, ACLU, etc., and _not_ the Cyherpunks, who have no lobbying activities
to speak of.
Indeed, this law makes the Cypherpunks group a co-conspirator. (In the same
way that the recent Omnibus Anti-Terrorism (or whatever it's callled)
criminalizes groups which support This Year's Enemies. (Like the War with
Oceania--or was it Eurasia?--the friend of today was yesterday's criminal
organization. For example, the Omnibus bill makes support of anti-PLO
groups a crime, for foreigners, as the PLO is now, this year, our "Partner
for Peace.")
This is all I'm suggesting, that yet another round of trying to persuade
Congress people is a waste, and that the _traditional_ focus on technology
is a better use of our time and effort.
Others are welcome to do as they wish. I'm just expressing my view that
Washington can spin out legislation faster than we can respond....they are,
after all, using our tax dollars to generate new laws, and have
intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies on their side with
armies of lawyers and lobbyists to help. Multi-billion dollar budgets are
also at stake.
The lobbyists for preserving liberty are few and far between.
Some would say this means Cypherpunks should step into the fray and become
a lobbying group. I don't see us as having the structure or organization to
become such a group. Those who wish to should probably form a real group to
do this, with bylaws and elected officials.
Anarchies are great, but there's no way an anarchy can have a "spokesman,"
or a budget for travel and lobbying, or a hundred other things that a
lobbying group needs. Cypherpunks--this list--is just not in a position to
be this group.

By causing us to go into paroxysms of activity every time they throw a new
piece of legislation over the transom, we dissipate our efforts in more
promising areas.
There's a place for lobbying--and I'm even a member of the EFF. But
lobbying is best done by those with lobbying backgrounds, legal
backgrounds, and a penchant for fund-raising.
There was once talk, in April of '93, about the Washington, D.C.
Cypherpunks group adopting "lobbying" as their own special focus area, with
educational visits to Congressional aides and attendance at crypto-related
hearings. Nothing came of this, for whatever reasons.
Why do I mention this? Most Cypherpunks live far from Washington, and our
influence is minimal. Few can travel to D.C. on even an occasional basis,
etc. (Ironically, EFF is evacuating D.C. I won't get into what their
reasons might be, but certainly they will now have even less effect. I'll
say one thing: the leaders of EFF may have realized what a trap lobbying
can become, and have chosen to instead focus on other areas.)
Anyway, Cypherpunks is a worldwide, technological-oriented group. We can do
more by spreading technology and undermining repressive legislation than we
can by being just another ineffectual lobbying group.
As I said in another message, if folks want to do it, fine.
Organizationally and financially, we are not equipped for lobbying. No
budget, no leadership, no bylaws, no tax filings, no report writings,
nothing. (Some of these things are important for lobbying, some are less
so. The "leadership" part is pretty important: who could claim to "speak"
on behalf of Cypherpunks? Nobody.)
I suggest a different organization, a different mailing list, for this effort.

@_subject: Unix not the Only Place for "Vanguard" Applications 
I disagree with this, depending on what one's interpretation of "vanguard"
is, and for what products.
For example, I've been a Macintosh user since 1986, despite having worked
for Intel for 12 years prior to that. (Actually, I'm a fan of the Mac OS
and Way of Doing Things and don't care whether the main microprocessor is
Motorola, Intel, or Phlogistonics.)
For many years the most interesting--to me--applications came first on the
Macintosh, then on the PC, and then only occasionally to Unix machines.
Apps like PageMaker, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Fractal Design Painter,
Eudora, MORE, and so forth. Things have changed recently, with Windows
getting the desirable apps a bit earlier than the Mac version. (The Mac
versions of the products above came first becuase of the obvious graphics
and user interface consistencies of the Mac, and the user community in
prepublication, journalism, and art environments. Writing for DOS in those
days was a real lose, because of the lack of a consistent set of standards
and toolbox calls...)
Only one program I use a lot came first on Unix boxes: FrameMaker. And
FrameMaker hit the Mac a few quarters after first appearing on Unix boxes,
around 1988 or so.
I'm not dismissing Unix boxes or Unix tools...they are obviously very
useful for running the Internet and the various tools that access it.
Enough said. (And SGI and Sun are doing pretty well. The "vanguard apps"
that run on these machines, including the well-known imaging apps, are not
things I use.)
But I think the point that PCs (and by extension, Macintoshes, which are a
flavor of PCs) are never in the vanguard is wrong. By my interpretation of
vanguard. (I expect a quibble, this being the Cypherpunks list, about
whether Jon meant "the majority of PC users won't be in the  vanguard of
Frankly, Unix fragmented into a bunch of pieces. Maybe it was because of
the USL-Novell-AT&T-Sun-Unix International-etc. battles (I don't even
recollect who was who in this battle). Maybe it was the News vs. X vs.
OpenLook vs. NeXTStep vs. etc. user interface battles.
In any case, I expect Windows (and Windows NT) will take an ever-increasing
share of the market for at least the next several years. I'm hardly alone
in this expectation.

Agreed, certainly.
I certainly would never say the success of Unix is due to snobbishness,
though personal taste does play a role. And, historically, the
academic/pedantic aspects of Unix played a role in its adoption.
(Most important, I think, was that the proliferation of minicomputer and
mainframe operating systems was controlled by Unix killing off all the
proprietary, vendor-specific OSs.)
Sure. Same here. All I was addressing was the claim that no vanguard apps
ever appear on PCs, that Unix is where it all happens.
I certainly have not claimed that. In fact, I'll be the first to concede
that Mac users are more ivory tower types, in the sense of being fanatics
and advocates for their platform. (Though there are some Unix bigots out
there, notably now on Linux....I don't see Linux making any strides in the
workstation (SGI, Sun) market, just on the cheap Intel-based boxes
people--mostly non-corporate, it seems to me--are buying.)

As I understand RICO (Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,
though the euphonious "Rico," a la South American drug kingpins, is the
real reason for the name), only the assets imputed to the illegal act can
be seized. Thus, boats, factories, houses, etc., that are imputed
(believed, claimed) to have been bought partially or wholly from funds from
illegal acts can be seized.
Civil penalties are another matter. If you're charged with distributing
something illegal and a fine of $250,000 is levied, then you may have to
sell everything you own to pay it, but it's not a RICO seizure.

Yes, make your letters to Congressmen look like ransom notes...it really
gets their attention!
Seriously, I have no doubt that the next generation of "direct mail" will
be geared toward automatic generation of personalized letters, using
various natural language parser generators (a la the "rant generator" many
of us have used), variable fonts and margins, and so on.
This will further "flood the channel" and will ultimately make letter
writing mostly meaningless. IN my case, I skip most letters to the
editor--at least for local newspapers and weeklies--as they look to be
automatically written ("I am outraged at your article about converting
Lighthouse Point into a nuclear-powered whale-packing plant...").
Cypherpunks could probably have an effect on hastening this "denial of
service" attack on the efficacy of letter-writing by releasing an
easy-to-use package that does all this letter writing at the click of a
button....just type in some key words, for the topics, and it does the

@_subject: Re: Automated Rant Generators and Letter Generators 
By the way, I should first say that I have nothing against letter writing,
and my comments about "hastening" a "denial of service" attack on
letter-writing are mostly just out of general interest.
Bart's comments about using Knuth's typographic work are interesting, to
the extent that letters need to look handwritten. In the Mac market, it's
possible to send in some handwriting samples and get back a font that
emulates the handwriting!
I don't think the pen plotter is actually needed--and few people would use
it--as most faxes can be emulated with laser printers (due of course to the
limited dots per inch resulution). In fact, most fax modems can directly
fax from any screen that can produce printed output. So, the combination of
handwriting fonts, automated rant generators (of varying rabidities), and
fax capabilities gives a pretty good start. Using lots of handwriting
samples, various other fonts, and a mix of styles in the letters will help.
Anyway, where this all gets interesting is the following:
* Can a kind of Turing Test be tried here?
That is, in this limited domain of "letters to the editor/Congressmen," can
a letter generator be implemented which generates letters effectively
indistinguishable from letters and faxes generated by actual human beings?
("Effectively indistinguishable" in the sense that a human reader could not
sort a set of letters into human- and machine-generated subsets with
statistically significant certainty better than guessing).
Of course this is also similar to the "style detectors" we so often talk about.
The crypto relevance has to do with detecting patterns in letters and
rants, in emulating these patterns, and (perhaps) in speeding up lobbying.
(Though I agree that widespread adoption of automated letter-writing, such
as the direct mail folks are already doing, will eventually just kill off
letter writing as a means of lobbying.)
This may also hasten the adoption, someday, of digital signatures.
Congressmen and their aides may check incoming letters against databases of
their consituents who have "registered" with them (lots of issues here).
Merely counting the "yes" and "no" letters has long been problematic, as
the Republicans have been leading in direct mail campaigns since at least
the mid-70s (recall Richard Viguerie...). Increased automation will just
make it even more obvious.

This is Cray Computer, not the older Cray Research.
Cray Computer was developing a GaAs-based computer that used advanced
robotic assembly/packaging. Cray Research spun off the project, led by
founder Seymour Cray, and the two companies were wholly separate. Cray
Research remained in Minnesota, while Cray Computer was located in Colorado
The split was largely arranged because Cray Research was unwilling or
unable to fund both the conventional supercomputer lines _and_ the more
experimental machines favored by Seymour Cray. So they let Seymour and the
technology split off, and a stock distribution was arranged (I was a
shareholder of Cray Research at the time, and recall the distribution).
Cray Research is continuing to sell "Crays," including successors of the
original Cray line and various multiprocessor machines based on the Sparc
Cray Computer was trying to find customers for its Cray 3 and (planned) Cray 4.
The saga of the collapse of Cray Computer has been going on for the past
year or so, with the last several months being the final chance to
reorganize the company and keep it going. They failed, apparently, and now
the final liquidation of assets is about to happen.
Why didn't the Agency bail them out? Not clear, but my guess is that the
advanced _process_ technology of Cray Computer was not so exciting to the
NSA. The "attack of the killer micros," to use Eugene Miya's phrasing, is
wiping out most conventional advanced processor attempts to get
supercomputer speed.
When a single piece of CMOS silicon gets 200-500 MIPS, and a bunch of them
can be put together, it gets pretty hard to justify hyper-expensive GaAs or
Josephson Junction or whatever technologies.
Sad for Seymour Cray, especially as he'd been pumping some of his own
fortune into keeping Cray Computer going, but its the nature of business.
And he'll bounce back, or take a well-deserved retirement.

It seems likely to me that an actual GAK system will require some fee per key.
For example, one might have to send in a form, maybe a diskette, and a $25
per key fee for "handling costs."
This is the way automobile registrations are handled (and they have become
a "revenue source"..I pay $450 per year to register my truck!!!).
This makes trying to register 2^128 keys rather expensive.

But fractal compression schemes are usually _lossy_, that is, some of the
original bits are irretrievably lost. (This should be clear also from the
amount of compression achieved....multiple files/images compress to the
"same" smaller file--by the "pigeonhold principle.")
Lossy compression is often OK for visual images and audible files, a la
music, but would be pretty bad for any scheme dependent on encryption.
(Not totally out of the question, as error correction could be used to
maybe  construct the critical bits, but then there's a messy battle going
on between lossy compresssion to get more bit density and adding bits for
error correction...)

@_subject: Netscape the Big Win 
Here is my experience with the last month of heavily using Netscape (1.1N),
after several years of using a mix of Unix-based tools on a Unix shell
account at Netcom (and several years of using Portal before that, beginning
in 1988).
(And intermittent Net use from 1973, when I had a very primitive account in
college at UC Santa Barbara, on the "Arpanet," to the mid-80s, when I had
various accounts while still at Intel.)
* I use Netscape to read News.
* I use Netscape to access the Web.
* I still use Eudora to send and receive Mail. (Netscape can currently send
mail, but not receive it. This is likely to change soon.)
Why is this important?
I believe, quite strongly, that we are headed toward a situation where the
large majority of Net/Web users are using some variant of Netscape, or
Mosaic/MacWeb/etc. (but probably Netscape, for various reasons).
Integration of crypto into Netscape is thus the Big Win.
I felt this was the case as far back as last fall, but my recent
experiences tell me this is more important than ever. Integration of PGP
and other crypto routines into Tin, Pine, Elm, Joe, Emacs, etc., is just
not as important.
IBM just paid nearly $3 billion for Lotus, largely for the "common
platform" of Lotus Notes. I believe Netscape is an even more important
common platform, and will displace Notes.
I have been asked many times by various of you about investments, as I've
been making my living the past decade through investments. The message here
is my strongest statement about what to invest in.
(I'm not saying one has to stand in line for the August IPO of Netscape
Communications, but the overall market will favor the Web browsers,
especially Netscape.)
The relevance for Cypherpunks interested in writing code is that, in my
carefully considered opinion, writing for Netscape and other Web browsers
is the Big Win. Even over Windows (except Windows browsers, of course).

@_subject: RE: Netscape the Big Win 
Speaking for myself, consistency of user interface.
To that extent, Netscape (or Lotus Notes, in a different context) becomes
the "operating environment" for the user, the place where he does his work.
The News reader in Netscape 1.1N is as good as the main "separate" news
reader, NewsWatcher, for the Macintosh, and has some added benefits. For
example, URLs in News postings automatically show up as clickable items,
which can be jumped to immediately. (Other News programs _could_ do this,
and maybe some of them do, but not on the Macintosh, at this moment.)
I don't know why "componentware" has not taken off. But it hasn't. OpenDoc
and OLE 2 are coming, but slowly.
Big programs tend to grow because they can increase market share by adding
capabilities, by pulling in more customers. We might prefer a world of
smaller apps, with componentware pieces, but it rarely happens.
And I'm not going to use half a dozen small programs, each doing slightly
different things and having different commands, when one will do nicely.
(I could list other pluses and minuses, a la my outline FAQ, but here's
just one more important item: cross-compatibility. Namely, with N smaller
programs in use, of varying versions, incompatibilities and even crashes
can result all too often ("We have discovered that MailMuncher 2.12 does
not work with NewsNabber 1.1."). At lest with something like Netscape, a
certain amound of cross-operability is likely, for various reasons.)
In any case, while I respect the views Pat is expressing, about
componentware and "small is better" approaches, the market is voting with
its feet for apps like Netscape, which are becoming the main programs folks
will use for communication, News reading, and Web surfing.
So go ahead and do it! I've been waiting for many years for such things.
To state an obvious non-crypto use of such "modules," why do all major word
processing and page layout apps have their own "dictionaries"? Why do I
have to train the dictionaries of Word, Nisus, FrameMaker, MORE, etc.? That
there have not been "dictionary modules," for many and sundry reasons, is
telling. (Before anyone mentions it, one can on the Mac use things like
"Thunder" instead of the local dictionaries...this is not the same as a
module usable by all programs, but instead is a user choice to bypass the
local dictionaries. We could quibble for hours about whether this is in
fact a universal module or not.

No offense, but "marginalizing" is what I love to do more than anything!
Seriously, the world is what the world is. I really don't care about "FSF"
one way or the other, and will join the rest of the world (apparently) in
using Netscape. And yes, I am "marginalizing" the work that anyone does on
"fringe" projects like Linux, which will likely always remain in the ghetto
of Unix hackers who want a cheap Unix running on their cheap 486 boxes...it
just ain't gonna take over inside corporations or amongst the many folks
like me.
Frankly, one of the great boons of my current setup is that I can
completely get away from Unix tools and commands, away from my Unix shell
account at Netcom, away from the arcane commands that vary from program to
program, away from tin and elm and emacs...my fingers are already
forgetting the emacs commands!
(Those of you like Unix, fine. I agree it is useful for many things, so I'm
not trying to debate Unix vs. the world. Just giving my perspective, and
apparently the perspective of the many who are adopting the Web browsers as
their "operating environments," insulated from the underlying cruft.)
(If the GNU folks were to do an "open, extensible, Netscape workalike. this
could be a win. Some may claim that Mosaic is/was that. We can debate this
in separate thread.)
I acknowledge that it has no mail reader, which is why I'm still using
Eudora. But as soon as it does....
And the newsreader is a matter of taste...it does all I want it to do, and
I'm a fairly heavy reader of News and contributor to Usenet groups. I
survived with "tin" for several years, so anything is possible.
I don't think the packages I "denigrate" are the key to the future
widespread use of crypto. Look at the actual usage patterns.
This makes my point. We may dismiss the masses as not being true Unix gurus
or as being ignorant of Emacs, but this is how crypto will become truly
ubiquitous. Not when people have to learn to compile code and create
clients, but when they can send encrypted messages easily and
That Qualcomm (Eudora), Netscape, Frontier, Microsoft, Lotus, and others
are working on an interoperable "Secure/MIME" should be encouraging.
Please, your insulting tone ("your musings," "try writing some code..") is
uncalled for. You have your views, I have mine.
From the large number of messages in this thread, apparently my points
struck a chord. Like it or not, huge numbers of users are using Netscape
and similar browsers. This is the basic reality. This is where the bulk of
crypto users are going to be, not compiling ftp-gotten PGP into their Emacs

This is precisely my view, although I try to call it an "operating
environment," so as to get away from quibbling about what is and what is
not a real OS.
There were reasons why some folks like to do as much work as they could in
an integrated environment like Emacs, regardless of the underlying OS
flavor. Many folk still do, and they read News, send mail, etc., all from
within Emacs.
Same idea with Netscape...albeit with a different focus. And my guess,
based on lots of indications, is that about a thousand times as many people
will soon be doing this with Netscape as with Emacs, or elm, or pine, etc.
Ray's comments about OpenDoc, HotJava, and other object-oriented tools fit
this picture, I think.
I am sorry that some folks heavily committed to the Linux route, or to
Emacs, or to GNU/FSF, or to other approaches feel that their work is
technically superior and deserves to be as popular as Netscape and simiar
approaches, but reality is reality.
(And I could be wrong on the way things will unfold. All I'm saying is that
technology is a moving target, that plans have to change, and that ease of
use will likely win out over technical sophistication. Folks who think the
stronger technology will inevitably win should pick up a copy of a
15-year-old book called "The Soul of a New Machine," by Tracy Kidder.)

@_subject: "Cypherpunks Write Code" as a Putdown 
I want to comment on this latest version of the "Cypherpunks write code"
universal putdown.
It's become common for debates on what is possible, what is likely, and
what should be done for someone to "trump" the argument with the mantra of
"Cypherpunks write code."
In my posting on why I think Netscape and related operating environments
represent the likeliest targets for widespread crypto use (the "big win" I
used in my title), I did not whine that others ought to write code for me.
I said that this is where users were going in massive numbers.
Take it or leave it, as an analysis, but the "try writing some code" is a
meaningless insult.
The world is made up of bridge designers, legal experts, authors, chip
designers, and on and on. Not just programmers.
The line "Cypherpunks write code"--which is sometimes treated here with a
reverence its origins do not support--was a reference to our view that
technology, meaning actual deployment, was more important and interesting
than yet more gabbing about liberty and privacy.
And what is "writing code"? Is it only Perl and C? Or does defining what a
remailer needs to do count as writing code? (Attendees at the first
Cypherpunks meeting, almost 3 years ago, can confirm that I was the one who
spend about two hours describing Chaum's mix work, and running the
"remailer experiment"...we debated how a remailer could actually work, and
Eric Hughes took on the task of writing the first one.)
The "BlackNet" experiment I ran actually worked...the keys worked, the
mechanisms worked, and the experiment has been used by many as an actual
concrete illustration of how untraceable information markets will develop.
An actual demonstration is worth more than mere speculation, and this was
an actual demonstration. I call this "writing code," albeit not C code.
(My actual code writing, in real computer languages, is oriented toward
Mathematica, on my Mac, and Smalltalk Agents. Not all programming is
oriented toward writing Unix tools, and I think the narrow interpretation
of "Cypherpunks write code" to mean this is misleading.)
In any case, even the ur-crypto hacker Zimmermann is writing very little
actual code in PGP these days...does this mean he should "try writing some
code" instead of doing what he apparently does best?
In short, the insulting tone of many Cypherpunks these days is saddening.
I plan to continue to speak my mind, to point out what I think are the more
important routes to a desirable future, and to criticize what I think are
dead ends and ghettoized approaches.

Just to clarify, you mentioned "useful at the home level." I can't speak
for Ray, but I certainly didn't mean HotJava (or PowerObjects, or OpenDoc,
or Agents tools, etc.) would be used at "the home level."
Such tools would likely be used at the programming level.
As to HotJava itself, who knows? It's one of several tooks coming along.
The key is that folks--millions of them at last count--are voting with
their feet that they want the ball of wax that is "The Web" (Netscape or
Mosaic, HTML, HTTP, browsers, automated handling of images and sounds,
integrated Newsreaders and mailers, etc.).
They, the millions of users, demonstrably don't want to mess with Linux, or
FreeBSD, or PGPelm, or even simple, straight text PGP (that is, PGP not
integrated with mailers, just standalone). They want ease-of-use and a
semantically simple model of how things work. (This is why I like Lisp
Machines when I programmed them for Intel, and why I was an early adopter
of the Macintosh, and why Windows has been doing so well...and why Netscape
is doing spectacularly well.)
This is not an "OS War" I'm taking sides in, just simple truth about what
people are buying, using, clamoring for. It's important to our longer-range
goals to recognize these important trends, like them or not.

@_subject: "Where is the Market?" 
I want to elaborate on the words from last December that I just posted, in
response to some comments about how I had just "discovered" the Web.
L. McCarthy just had some good points about differing privacy/political
goals here on this list.
When we first formed, almost three years ago, one of the first things we
did at a physical meeting--and the issue was echoed on the new mailing
list--was to conduct a poll of who was using what mail tools, e.g., pine,
elm, emacs, Microsoft Mail, MCI Mail (?), Lotus Notes, Eudora, etc. The
results--which should be in the archives for sometime around
November-December 1992--were, as expected, all over the map. No clear
winner. The reason for the poll was obvious: to determine what sort of
target markets the various PGP integrators would have.
Even then, there were religious wars, with, for example, the emacs crowd
arguing that PGP should be integrated into emacs and then the world could
just switch to emacs (as they should have long before :-)).
Now I wish I could draw pictures here---and that I can't draw pictures here
and still communicate with most of you here makes an interesting point
about the still-dominant nature of ASCII, which ain't about to change
anytime soon for lists like this---so I could better explain my "stable
attractors" line of reasoning. But I'll do it instead with more words.
Here's an elaboration on my points made last December 15:
"I see two "stable attractors" for text/graphics/multimedia/etc. sent
over the Net:"
What I mean by "stable attractors" are the "islands" or regions in product
space that have solidity and success. Leading commercial products are
obvious examples, with a cloud of related or ancillary products supporting
them. Product versions are like a chain of these islands.
As with "attractors" in general (and I assume everyone on this list has
read much about attractors, usually in the context of strange attractors),
there are not many "occupied" regions in the nether-realm between
attractors. That is, between the islands lies open water. "Survival" is
difficult in these open waters.
My main model for software, borne out by everything I see, is that this
"island colonization" model is appropriate.
"1. Straight text, ASCII, 80 column format. All systems can handle
this, all mailers and newsreaders can handle it, it's what the Usenet
is essentially based upon, and it gets the job done. It meets the
needs of 95% of us for 95% of our needs."
By this I mean just what this list is doing _now_. ASCII is the de facto
lingua franca. People with PCs, various operating systems on their PCs
(DOS, Win3.1, Win95beta, Linux, OS/2, NeXTStep, Solaris, etc.),
Macintoshes, terminals, Amigas, Ataris, Suns, SGIs, NeXTs, and so on, are
all mostly able to read what is distributed here.
Deviations occur, but mostly unintentially or as "experiments."
Occasionally people will still try to send NeXT-formatted mail--I forget
what it was called--and various people send their messages as
"attachments," even when the text is apparently just straight ASCII.
(Hint to the attachment-senders: I periodically go into the "Attachments"
folder on my system and empty it of the unread big and little attachments
that have accumulated in it...others have said they do the same. So, if
your message will fit into the standard text/ASCII "primary format" of the
Cypherpunks list, that is how you should send it...and if it _isn't _
straight text, but instead includes attached spreadsheets, JPEG movies of
the Waco raid, etc., you might ask yourself just how many people will
bother to read or view your message?)
Hence my comment that "the written word" is a massively stable, heavily
colonized "island" or "attractor." It can be handled in foreign languages,
with some difficulty, and on nearly any computer system in the world. It is
the language of legal briefs, of economic reports, of crop reports, and of
a zillion other forms of communication. Pure text is powerful stuff.
But what about pictures, illustrations, diagrams? Magazines and books use
them widely, so why can't we? And what about styled text, footnotes,
superscripts, hypertext links, etc.?
Well, in a different world we might have adopted standards earlier than we
did and such things might be more common and acceptable today.
(For those who will argue that it is "possible" to exchange e-mail with
embedded diagrams, equations, footnotes, etc., "sure."  But ask yourself
how many times you have ever actually _done_ this, with friends and e-mail
correspondents? Some who have done this point out that it usually involved
folks within corporations who can standardize on the tools and default
settings to make this transparent...then they can send richly-formatted
stuff without excessive work. And how many other mailing lists, besides
Cypherpunks, have such embedded diagrams and illustrations? I'm not talking
about the Web here--I'll get to it in my next point--but about what this
list is and what NetNews, for example, is.
What will "the masses" likely use to implement a richer communications
channel, one that encompass pictures, illustrations, movies, spreadsheets,
etc.? What will be the _next_ big island people colonize? (Which is of
obvious interest for the deployment of crypto to users.)
From Dec. 15:
"2. The Web, for graphics, images, etc. This will be the next main
stable attractor, deployed on many platforms. (I'm assuming the debate
here about Netscape standards does not imply much of a fragmentation,
that Mosaic, Netscape, MacWeb, etc., will all basically be able to
display Web pages in much the same way.)"
Enough people are starting to "surf the Web" (whatever you think of that
expression) that this is becoming the _de facto_ next attractor, or island.
_Millions_ of users will have whatever tools and "helper apps" in their
versions of Mosaic, Netscape, MacWeb, etc. such that this will be the
platform/environment of choice. As the browsers add e-mail (receiving, as
most or all can send mail), and as applets/helpers proliferate, then these
platforms/environments will allow new forms of e-mail to finally become
_widespread_ (note that I did not say "possible," but instead said
Many folks I have expressed this view to have said "But the Web is not a
two-way medium like e-mail." That is, most people spend most of their time
on the Web "reading" (viewing) the stuff others have put on the Web.
Three points:
1. This is changing already, as "feedback" is included on pages. This
feedback is beginning to look like local newsgroups, and will become more
so (IMO).
(Speculation: The current Usenet "feed" is of course huge. It may get
replaced, via evolution/revolution, by a shift to a Web-oriented system of
local newsgroups. What I mean by this is that instead of reading, say,
"alt.cypherpunks," one points one's browser at
" and uses one's various Web tools to browse,
sort, search, read, and respond to comments of others. BTW, this could be
done today, and might be a better alternative than creating
"alt.cypherpunks." The current approach of shipping the entire Usenet feed
to all the sites that carry it is likely to eventually break down.)
(Even more speculation: Currently I point my Netscape at which news server
I wish, from a choice of several. The idea of "subscription-based" News
sites is an interesting one. I might pay extra money for a site that is
very current and carries all News groups, while parents might pick a site
that is sufficiently sanitized for them, a site they let their children
access. Much more to say here, but I see several Cypherpunks themes.)
2. The easy-to-use integration of helper apps into Web browsers will confer
the same capabilities on mailers that are now associated with these Web
browsers. (Again, don't tell me what _your_ mailer can now do, look to what
the millions of people are using...they'll gain a lot when their mailers,
whether part of Netscape or MacWeb or not, can automatically handle things
their browsers can now handle.)
3. The main development seems to me to be in Web tools these days. Being a
user of "tin" for several years, and seeing minimal development of it the
past two years, I've seen tin get almost no new features. Ditto for "elm,"
my mailer (when logged-on to Unix systems). (Before you comment, I can't
speak for trn, nn, rn, etc., or mailers such as pine. But friends of mine
have told me the same stagnation is happening with other mailers and
newsreaders. Many of the developers of tin, elm, archie, gopher, etc., have
moved on to bigger and better things.))
So, given that it has long been recognized as a valid Cypherpunks goal to
see what people are using for mail and newsreading, I think an analysis of
what's likely to be popular amongst the "masses" is valid. (I don't disdain
the "masses," at least not in this context. The needs of a lawyer wanting
to communicate securely with his client are not the needs of a C hacker
wanting to configure his Linux box to auto-sign his emacs messages.)
My views on the Web have *not* changed dramatically since last fall and
winter when I was talking in these terms, though all I had then was a
text-oriented browser (lynx), and it was not very exciting (as Ray Cromwell
also notes).
(And I recall this discussion on the importance of the Web going on several
times earlier, including a prediction/hope by the Extropians list
organizers, including Harry Shapiro (Hawk) that the Web could be the
solution for distributing graphics-content mailing lists...this was around
1993 sometime.)
I'm definitely not "dissing" Unix, though I personally never had much use
for it. The world is made up of all kinds of people. Some are hackers, some
are expert cryptographers, some are lawyers, and so on. The needs of a
lawyer for computer tools and writing aids are quite a bit different from
those of someone who wants to put together a Linux box for C hacking.
If I sound snide in my comments about Linux, I don't mean to be. What I
mean is that very, very few users, even fairly sophisticated users, are
going to be doing their work on Linux boxes. (If I'm wrong about this, and
Linux becomes a serious deployment system--as opposed to a Sun-killer,
which is what it looks like now--then I'll acknowledge that I was wrong.)
As cheap boxes to deploy remailers and Web sites on, Linux sounds like a
win. I'm unconvinced that it has a future for _general_ users, though. (And
by general users I don't mean computer-phobic newbies, I mean the folks
buying Windows in the tens of millions and Macs in the millions per year.
Wider use of crypto means these users, not just the current PGP users.)
Nothing has changed my view that the Web is clearly the next big attractor,
the next big island. Integrating crypto into it is likely the next big win,
which is how this latest thread started. (And by "integrating crypto into
it" I don't necessarily mean getting the source code from Netscape or Spry
or whomever and adding it...the integration can be done in multiple ways, I
think, and as several folks here are already thinking about.)
In any case, the future will unfold as it unfolds. Maybe I'm right, maybe
not. Maybe only partially right.
Debate is healthy, and at least this debate is closer to being on-topic
than discussions of red mercury (and the even rarer columbium-niobum alloys
the Japanese have developed) and Cypherpunks logos.

Reasons this won't work:
1. The Real Reason: It's terminally cute, and terminally cute arguments

2. The Technical Reason: As I recollect, it is unproven that "any sequence
of digits will appear in pi someplace." (It may be expected that any finite

reason to suspect such a proof might be impossible.). A wise-ass judge--not

I urge that we deal with key registration on more plausible bases than
trickery and sophistry.

Some of you have expressed skepticism about the mention of "S/MIME."
The longterm significance of S/MIME is debatable, of course. But here's the
press release I got from Jim Bidzos:
     RSA News Release
     For information, contact:

     Major Networking and Messaging Vendors Endorse Open Specification for
     Secure E-Mail
     S/MIME Based on RSA Public-Key Encryption Technology
     Redwood Shores, CA -- July 24, 1995 -- Several major networking and
     messaging vendors, in conjunction with leading cryptography developer
     RSA Data Security today announced their endorsement of a specification
     for interoperable e-mail security, to be known as "S/MIME", short for
     "Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions".  Several of the
     vendors announced plans to release S/MIME-compliant products next
     quarter.
     The S/MIME specification is based on the popular Internet MIME
     standard (RFC 1521), which provides a general structure for the
     content type of Internet mail messages and allows extensions for new
     content type applications... like security.  S/MIME will allow vendors
     to independently develop interoperable RSA-based security for their
     e-mail platforms, so that an S/MIME message composed and encrypted on
     one vendor's application can be successfully received and decrypted on
     a different one.
     Major vendors who today announced support for the S/MIME secure
     interoperable
     e-mail plan include Microsoft, Lotus, Banyan, ConnectSoft, QUALCOMM,
     Frontier Technologies, Network Computing Devices, FTP Software,
     VeriSign, Wollongong, SecureWare and RSA.
     Sophisticated encryption and authentication technology has been viewed
     as the crucial enabling technology for electronic commerce over the
     World Wide Web -- but encryption has been slow to come to e-mail, with
     most packages offering no security whatsoever. "Commercial e-mail
     packages don't offer encryption because, up until now, there have been
     few open security specifications," said Jim Bidzos, RSA President.
     "Internet Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) is excellent for text-based
     messages. MIME represents the next generation, and has been widely
     adopted because of its ability to handle nearly any content type. The
     new S/MIME allows you to secure this rich content."
     Today's flurry of official endorsements from industry bodes well for
     the S/MIME plan.
     "We fully expect S/MIME to be the defacto standard for
     vendor-independent e-mail encryption.  Solid encryption is something
     that our customers have been asking us for, but up until now, we
     didn't have a viable option.  S/MIME gives them everything they want:
     RSA encryption, digital signatures, and the ability to mix different
     vendors' e-mail systems without losing that security," said Bob
     Dickinson, ConnectSoft Vice President and General Manager Consumer
     Online Products & Services Division.
     "Frontier Technologies believes that in the future most companies will
     routinely encrypt electronic mail messages sent over the public
     Internet," said Dr. Prakash Ambegaonkar, Frontier Technologies'
     president.  "This will only happen once there is a well-understood
     standard for secure e-mail that is easy to implement.  Frontier has
     several years experience in developing secure e-mail solutions.  In
     order to speed the adoption of the S/MIME specification, Frontier
     Technologies intends not only to be one of the first vendors to
     support S/MIME in its networking software, but to also make our
     initial implementation of the S/MIME protocol freely available for
     other vendors to use as a reference."
     "The freedom to have a private conversation is fundamental to personal
     communication that is the essence of electronic mail," said John
     Noerenberg, Director of Engineering for QUEST products at QUALCOMM.
     "Wide-spread acceptance of specs like S/MIME make it possible for
     individuals and organizations alike to conduct their business over the
     net secure in the knowledge that their private business is, in fact,
     private."
     "FTP Software is glad to endorse the S/MIME blueprint for secure
     electronic communication," said John O'Hara, director of development
     for FTP Software.  "Whether communicating with customers, business
     partners or remote offices, companies need to ensure that confidential
     information stays confidential.  This was difficult in the past, since
     organizations are connected through diverse messaging systems from
     competing vendors.  S/MIME eliminates those barriers by facilitating
     implementations across multiple vendor products."
     "Network Computing Devices is commited to answering market demand for
     network information access software providing an even higher level of
     protection and interoperability over LANs and across the Internet,"
     said Mike Harrigan, co-founder and vice president of NCD.  "S/MIME
     will further enhance our customers' ability to utilize our  e-mail
     solution, Z-Mail, and Internet navigation software tool, Mariner, in
     such a secure networked environment.  For this reason we fully intend
     to support the specification provided by S/MIME within the next
     quarter."
     This wll be an exciting catalyst for the rapid deployment of secure,
     interoperable e-mail from most of the industry leaders," said Web
     Augustine, VeriSign vice president of marketing & business
     development.  "VeriSign is committed to making our Digital ID services
     available to all companies that implement S/MIME and desire to work
     with a trusted third-party to certify public keys for their
     end-users."
     S/MIME is based on the intervendor PKCS (Public Key Cryptography
     Standards) which were established by a consortium of RSA, Microsoft,
     Lotus, Apple, Novell, Digital, Sun and the Massachusetts Institute of
     Technology in 1991.  PKCS is the most widely implemented suite of
     commercial cryptographic standards in the United States.  The common
     PKCS specifications allow developers to independently develop secure
     applications that will interoperate with other PKCS-secured
     applications.
     Developers interested in S/MIME can get more information at RSA's web
     site, at  in the "What's New" section.
     RSA Data Security is the world's "brand name" for cryptography, with
     over 10 million copies of RSA encryption and authentication
     technologies installed and in use worldwide. RSA technologies are part
     of existing and proposed standards for the Internet and World Wide
     Web, CCITT, ISO, ANSI, IEEE, and business, financial and electronic
     commerce networks around the globe. The Company develops and markets
     platform-independent developer's kits, end-user products, and provides
     comprehensive cryptographic consulting services. Founded in 1982 by
     the inventors of the RSA Public Key Cryptosystem, the company is
     headquartered in Redwood City, California.

There should be no technical reason why voice encryption, or even
end-to-end digital packet encryption, cannot be used. The various satellite
systems (Iridium, Teledesic, Globalstar, etc.) also are targetting laptops,
personal communicators (a la Newton, Envoy, etc.), and thus cannot afford
to screw with the signal in any significant way. (And error correction
codes could easily deal with even fairly massive screwing around with,
should the satcom companies be foolish enough to try to "dither" the
signals....which I doubt they'll ever do.)
The risk is not technical, but legislative.
The government of the U.S. could, for example, mandate to the satcom
companies that only GAK/escrow encryption is permissable...how enforceable
this is echoes the debate we've had for almost three years on such things.
But the McCaw/Microsoft/Motorola/Qualcomm sorts of companies may have to
make token efforts to comply.
I don't expect the crypto banners to win, long run, but I would guess that
right now they are jawboning with the main satellite companies to make
things harder.
The faster systems like "Nautilus" are deployed, the better.

NetScape a kitchen sink? Perhaps, but kitchen sinks have been selling

Hate to disagree with Lucky, but....
I've cashed checks at Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Comerica (whatever
_that_ is), etc., without having an account at these banks, and without
having to pay any fee, and without any more ID than a driver's license. (I
have no accounts at California banks, so all checks sent to me are,
perforce, not checks drawn at "my" bank...and yet I've never had to pay a
dime to cash a check. The times I've gotten out of state checks, I've of
course not expected third parties to cash them for free for me...usually I
just deposit them by mail.)
Hasn't happened to me.
Hasn't happened to me. I walk into banks, present the checks drawn on their
own bank, ask to have it cashed, and all they want is to make sure I'm the
person to whom the check is drawn. No fees, no refusals to cash.
Maybe I have the magic touch.
I find U.S. banks to be marvels of efficiency. (But then I can remember
running out of cash on a Saturday and having no way to get any more cash

Bay Aryans can attest to the fact that in the last several months I've
refused to have anything to do with the various hypings and personality
profiles the info rags are so focussed on. I enjoyed talking to Timothy
Leary for a few minutes at a party, but refused to appear on camera with
him in a "Cypherpunks on parade" segment for a Japanese television program.
I'm not condemning those who do interviews--I did a few myself--but I think

Then, just today, my younger brother told me he'd been reading about
Mitnick and Shimomura in "Rolling Stone.")

of PRZ interviews are doing some good.
I'm becoming more of a Zen Buddhist monastic skeptic on these issues every day.

There were at least 3 books, plus at least one t.v. miniseries, plus
extensive media coverage. Until the Aldrich Ames case, this was about the
most serious spying case in modern times. (It may or may not have been
bigger than Ames, depending on the relative importance of "technical means"
vs. "humint.")
The undersea cable eavesdropping program was "Ivy Bells," and was revealed
to the Sovs by Walker and his associates. I don't know if they also knew
about via alternate sources.
On the other issue, whether either or both of the Rosenbergs were spies,
things have settled yet. Sudoplatov, in "Special Tasks," claims they were
both spies. Others doubt it.
(For you Bond fans, Sudoplatov headed up "Smersh." Russian for "Death to
spies." Yes, it really existed, unlike, say "U.N.C.L.E.")
On the issue of whether in the 1950s the U.S. government knew the
Rosenbergs were spies, we have even less information. A trial was held and
guilty verdict returned, but reasonable folks may disagree. My guess? Yes,
they were probably spies.
The Rosenbergs were certainly the Mumia Abu Jamals of their day.

The "VCR-Plus" codes that are already published essentially offer this code
already. Thus, one looks in the channel lisings and finds "Debbie Does Fort
Meade" has a VCR-Plus code of "31415926," which one enters to set recording
times, etc. (This even has some low-level crypto content, as the VCRPlus
coding system was a topic of much debate a couple of years ago.)
True, this takes work. (Though some satellite systems offer it via a
point-and-click interface, on the actual t.v. screen.)
The key difference between this setup and the "in band" proposal RAH is
making is that VCR-Plus is "out of band." But the point is that the info is
there in both cases.
The infrastructure for using this to block stuff doesn't exist in most
t.v.s or VCRs, but then it wouldn't exist either with RAH's in-band program
labelling approach (which I expect is coming anyway--my cable system
reports on what network it's seeing, even as the networks alter lineups,
and reports time, system status, etc....all presumably in the 4-line
interval, etc.)
What's really flawed about these "lockout" schemes is that the installed
base of televisions and VCRs is NOT going to go away, that no magic wand is
going to give a single mother who wants to control what her children watch
a new t.v. or VCR. As some non-stupid Senators noted, the V-chip system
will go into the households who need it the _least_!

Harry Bartholomew was telling me a year or so ago about some ideas for

commercial from non-commercial signal is, I think, a tough one.
My point earlier was not to actually do this, but to suggest that if the
V-chip is to code various kinds of content, then the logic is strong for
commercial content to be similarly coded. (For example, schools often show
taped broadcasts...they might claim that it would be harmful and improper
for children to be exposed to beer commercial during school hours...)
This would gore the ox of the advertisers, so they might quietly have the

@_subject: Attacks on PGP 
Things are heating up between Fred Cohen and some of the rest of the list.
I don't believe MIT is in collusion with the NSA or any other government
agency to deliberately weaken or cripple PGP. I base this on having dealt
with some of the MIT folks, with the various source code analyses folks
have done, etc.
However, I think it's a perfectly *fine* idea for some group to launch a
cryptanalytic attack on PGP, or an attack based on any other approaches.
This is the "tiger team," or "Team B" approach to finding flaws and
I don't take the security of PGP only on faith, though analyzing it is not
my bag, as they say. Rather, I use the Popper/Bartley notions of
falsifiabilty and see truth as a process, not a state. Seeing lots of
source code available, independent compilations on various machines, and
believing neither Zimmermann nor Atkins nor Schiller, etc., would consent
to inserting back doors into PGP, I am thus led to _believe_ that PGP is
probably not so affected. Doesn't mean it isn't so, but I'm not overly
worried about it.
Still, more studies and technical attacks (technical, not verbal) would be
One of the problems we in the "civilian cryptography" sector face is that
we don't have much activity in cryptanalysis. (We've talked about this
several times before, before Fred Cohen joined the list, for example.) The
NSA and other intelligence agencies have not only code makers, they also
have code _breakers_ (such as modern ciphers are breakable, which hasn't
been the case much lately, if Bamford and Kahn are to be believed).
Probably entire groups whose only job is to try to break the systems
devised by others. (Modern ciphers are not as prone to breakage as earlier
ciphers were, for technical reasons, so I suspect the number of
cryptanalysts has shrunk since the good old days when they had more
successes...there may only be a small contingent left...)
The lack of cryptanalysis papers at "Crypto" has been striking...I was told
that the program committee considers cryptanalysis to be less important
than original research. (I can see the rationale in this, as Crypto is an
academic/research conference, and there are really no "engineering" crypto
conferences. And cryptanalysis might not even fit into an engineering
conference very well, as cryptanalysis is traditionally a sort of
"hobbyist" activity--if you've read Kahn you'll know what I mean.)
Crypto comes in various flavors, from hardware implementations, to number
theory, to Unix/IETF sorts of standards, to digital cash, and even to
statistical analysis. It is dangerous to have a "monoculture" in which one
topic is the trendy one and everyone is urged to work on that (whether the
"that" is PGP or Java or anything else equally trendy).
Most of the activity has been on adding hooks to PGP to make it usable in
other programs, or on remailers. Not as much effort has gone into proofs of
validity, systems analysis, etc. (Eric Hughes and I talked about this
several years ago, before the Cypherpunks group was formed...the need for
"Viper"-like systems with provably correct components, especially for
digital money, etc.)
If folks think PGP is flawed, or deserves an independent and critical look,
then this is a good project for someone. (I think several such analyses
have been made, however...this doesn't make it impossible for a flaw or
backdoor to exist, but at least the code has been examined by various
folks. I'm personally not too worried, though this has little suasive
(The Monoculture of Trendy Projects. My own programming mini-project, while
proceeding slowly, is of a pattern extractor and "entropy estimator" for
text. Stuff like measuring patterns, examining clusterings and
author-specific patterns. I'm writing it as a bunch of "critic agents" who
are responsible for different areas of analysis. In SmalltalkAgents. My
point? There will be those who cite the "monoculture" and scoff at anything
not written in C++ for Unix boxes, or not built to be Net-aware from the
gitgo, or not written as applets in Java....oh well, in Digital Walden, one
marches to a different drummer. Better to program the thing I _want_ to
program rather than the things I _don't_ want to program, and hence
_won't_. Final note: it'll be ready for use and maybe demonstration when
it's ready. And ready when it's finished, finished when it's ready.)
I've long appreciated Fred Cohen's work on viruses, so it's nice to have
him on the Cypherpunks list. Maybe Fred can tell us if it's really true
that he was stopped by U.S. Customs and held for many hours at the Canadian
border when going to or returning from a conference where he described
computer viruses....

Right, but it's a kind of vicious circle. What I meant about cryptanalysis
not really be "academic" is that not much status attaches to having broken
a specific message.
I guess this is my bias, as I think of the "differential cryptanalysis" as
not really being cryptanalysis :-}. In the sense that it's basic research
unto itself, not the grungy cracking of an actual cipher.
But you're right that the stuff on Wiener's estimates for a DES-cracking
machine, on the differential cryptanalysis work, etc., _does_ make it into
Crypto. Ditto for breaking ciphers (showing them to be flawed). I just
never see papers describing actual attacks on specific systems...maybe
those who do such things are talking?
I guess the bottom line of what I'm saying is that if some person or group
wants to be a "tiger team" to try to find flaws in PGP, to try to break it,
this would be a nifty thing. I doubt anyone on this list disagrees.

On a lighter note, I've recently gotten a new book, "Artificial
Intelligence: A Modern Approach," by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, 1995,
Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-103805-2.
In 900 pages of well laid-out text, with excellent use of typography to
make finding topics easy, it seems to be a great compendium of methods
loosely called "AI."
AI has gotten a bad rap, perhaps deservedly after the hype of the mid-80s,
but the methods are useful for various purposes.
This book is focussed on "agents," and lots of code fragments are available
(in Common Lisp) for actual construction of agents. Topics that relate to
Cypherpunks are scattered throughout the text, including stuff on planning,
provably correct designs, game theory, simulations, neural nets, belief,
and ontology. Lots more stuff, too. (If I were writing a formal book
review, I'd say more. But this is just a pointer, so that interested folks
can check it out at their local technical bookstore or university library.)
Not a lot to do with getting PGP 3.0 out the door, and not a lot to do with
building remailers, but stuff I find interesting.

In fact, most religious groups are distrustful of "The Gubment" deciding

_their_ side, not to get "The Gubment" to do it for them.
Orrin Hatch, a Mormon, has said that he grew up in Pennsylvania, and he
chafed under having to say the school prayers of the Dominant Religious
Paradigm. He has said that this makes him skeptical and critical of any
efforts to institute religion in classrooms.
I don't see any religion in America as being sufficiently dominant that it
thinks it can get its particular agenda accepted as the Dominant Religious
Paradigm. That is, they all seem suspicious of government involvement.
All to the good.

@_subject: Appropriate Topics? 
As I see things, talking about Ray's ideas for an object-oriented crypto
library is a big part of what this list is for. (Ditto for Wei Dai's code,
for Hal's code, and so on.)
However, it's a mistake to think that the _only_ thing appropriate for the
list is talking about code (of either kind). Not that Ray said this.
It seems to me the list is pretty well-balanced between several different
kinds of topics:
* crypto -- RSA, Diffie-Hellman, entropy, randomness, denial of service
attacks, and so on.
* software -- PGP implementations, hooks to other programs, MIME, Unix,
C++, Java, TCL, etc.
* policy -- Exon, EFF, Perl t-shirts, law, export, etc. (The worst of these
are the long policy analyses forwarded to this list from other places.)
* cultural -- movies with crypto or security themes, books, comments,
humor, etc.
* speculation -- tax effects, money laundering, crypto anarchy, etc.
* rants and conspiracies -- coverups, NSA, Waco, black helicopters, Masons,
etc. (the worst of these rants are long, rambling conspiracy theories
forwarded to this list from other places...these are probably the items
that least belong here).
(Note that the two serious problems--policy statements and conspiracy rants
forwarded from other places--share a common point: they are not written for
the Cypherpunks list by Cypherpunks...they are just stuff forwarded, with
only tangential interest to the list. And they tend to be long.)
Are these themes appropriate? Some folks want to read posts on one topic,
some on others, etc.
It's a fact that highly-specialized or detailed posts about, say, crypto
libraries, will not get as many general comments--in real life or on this
list--as a reference to a current movie will get. That's the nature of
things. I could go on about why this is so, but I think you all know why.
The "Cypherpunks write code" mantra, sometimes cited by those who dislike
the discussions they see, has a broader interpretation. To wit, instead of
asking others to write the code you want to see, try writing it yourself.
And this directly relates to postings: instead of asking for a different
kind of post, one should just _write_ that kind of post!
People will talk about what they want to talk about. If they get _too_ far
off into themes only distantly related to the ostensible themes of this
list, then usually some slight peer pressure will work. Plus, if people
don't respond, the threads die.
The noise messages of the form "This is not about writing code; this does
not belong on Cypherpunks" are misguided. The list is made up of people who
have crypto and privacy concerns broader than just writing C++ code for

@_subject: RSA has been proved correct 
Serendipity strikes.
I was reading the logic programming/theorem proving chapter of my new
Russell and Norvig book on AI, and came across something I once knew about
but had forgotten: the Boyer-Moore theorem prover was applied to the RSA
algorithm and the correctness of it was verified. Correctness in the sense
of showing that outputs match formal specs, for all inputs.
The paper is: Boyer, R.S and Moore, J.S. (1984). Proof checking the RSA
public key encryption algorithm, "American Mathematical Monthly,"
Now this does not mean:
- that implementations cannot have flaws, backdoors, etc.
- that larger systems which use RSA cannot have flaws, backdoors, etc.
What it says is that there is hope that formal verification of critical
modules is possible.
I can't imagine too many areas of software engineering that are more
critical to modularize and verify than crypto and digital money sorts of
Huge monolithic programs are vastly more difficult--probably
intractable--to verify.
The "crypto library" project(s)--I use the plural because there have been
several such projects--are good ideas. Small modules that do one thing and
one thing only are best for building larger modules robustly.

@_subject: Re: MS Money password problem 
This, of course, is the rationale for the "key escrow" systems (as opposed
to the government-mandated "key escrow" proposals, which are not an
"escrow" sytem of this kind).
"Escrow" is sufficiently overloaded with real estate connotations that I
wish the industry would adopt a different term. Carl Ellison's "GAK" is
cute, but is hardly likely to ever be adopted widely.
(No, I'm not calling for another round of suggested names, just opining
that "key escrow" is a terrible name.)
