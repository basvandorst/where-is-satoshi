@_subject: Anyone going to DEFCON 
August 6. the let me August 6. the let me I don't know if anyone else from this list is going but I will be there for the whole conference and wouldn't mind meeting up with some of the people from this list.  You might want to join the "defcon stuff" list.  It is just for people going to DefCon to talk about meetings and stuff.  It is dc-stuff (I think) if that doesn't work mail me and I'll get it from one of my message.

@_subject: C'punks at DefCon 
Well, a couple other c'punks have mailed me to determine a time and a place.  It looks like everyone wants to meet in the lobby of the Tropicana sometime Friday before Hacker Jeopardy.  Nobody has stated a concrete time yet so I guess we'll all just wander through the lobby every now and then.  Any suggestions on a time?
