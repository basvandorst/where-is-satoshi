How does this follow?  I actually makes no sense.  With better advertising
they would have more customers, more volume, lower overhead, and thus
lower prices.  Just like any other business.
I think rather, a tradition of obscurity has built up, because the
offshore havens are based obscure legal legerdemain that requires
stiff legal fees.  If a business catering to the upper middle class
rather than the wealthy were set up, this would require blowing away
a lot of the legal obscurity, which the lawyers and fraudsters (who
take full advantage of the fine print) are loathe to do.
He who dares to cut through the webs of legal bullshit and governmental censorship of offshore techniques will upen up a
tremendous market and shake the foundataions of the planet.
