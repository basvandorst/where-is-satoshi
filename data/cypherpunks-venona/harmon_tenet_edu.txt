@_subject: MacPGP 2.6 (fwd) 
Just food for thought!
The following is the complete, unedited plaintext of a message I
received via CompuServe from Christopher W. Geib, a software developer
who spent several years as a military intelligence officer.  Chris has
written a very fine Windows interface for PGP which I'll be uploading
as soon as I get the newest release (with Chris's permission, of
course).  I trust his judgment on this one.
 ~~~ =====(Begin plaintext)=====
I sent this to Mich Kabay of the NCSA Forum.  Thought you might find it of
interest. Note that 2.5 is also a MIT/NSA concoction.
As I reflected on more and more on this posting, it occurred to me
that I was smelling a rat.  The NCSA Forum members and others who
visit here should give thought to this issue.  A puzzle of sorts seems
to be developing regarding PGP in general, and private possession of
crypto in particular.  Let me provide some pieces to this puzzle, and
perhaps you and others may begin to see the bigger picture that seems
to be unfolding.
Piece   As you may already know, MIT is the single largest ($'s)
outside contractor to the NSA.
Piece   MIT is frustrated they feel that they have been somehow
cheated financially by the proliferation of PGP 2.3a as freeware. (I
still think that is insane as RSA was developed using public funding)
Piece   NSA is frustrated because of the apparent strength of the
imported Idea(tm) cipher.
Piece   NSA is pushing the Clipper crypto technology so that Big
Brother can have a free and easy backdoor to violate the privacy of
Americans.  Note too, that Clipper technology was assisted along by
Piece   PGP 2.6 will *not* be compatible with 2.3a after Sept 1994
for 2-way encryption.  This accomplishes reduced international secure
traffic by private individuals and businesses.  This is exactly the
same problem that Clipper has.
Have you begun to see the big Puzzle Palace picture yet?  Unless my
eyes deceive me, I would say this, MIT and NSA have teamed up together
on PGP 2.6!  This version, until proven otherwise (through examination
of the source code, etc.), is likely to contain a backdoor big enough
to drive a Mack truck through it.  The back door is likely similar to
Clipper and for the same intent.  Given how much flak NSA has gotten
over Clipper, NSA will very likely stay very mum about the whole
issue.  The big winners are NSA and MIT.  They both get exactly what
each has wanted all along.  MIT gets royalties they think they
deserve, NSA gets what they intend to have anyway, a means to continue
listening into citizens private conversations.  NSA also wins on the
international front by reducing it's workload of analyzing
international encrypted traffic.  Business and the citizens lose
because it isolates the US from Europe and the international
I strongly recommend that anyone who acquires PGP 2.6 do so with a
jaundiced eye.  Until the private sector can review, and analyze this
new MIT/NSA system, one *must* assume that it is as if it contained a
virus, one you may never know it has.  I for one will continue with
the present version as it's inventors have no reason to capture
private communications.
If you think appropriate, please upload to Internet Risks with my
Christopher W. Geib
 ~~~ =====(End of plaintext)=====
So you decide, guys.  Is it worth the risk?  Again, just some
thoughts, but remember this:  if you go to either ver. 2.5 or 2.6,
you'll probably have to revoke your ver. 2.3 keys and start afresh
with new ones, which might not be secure in the first place.
... If the Pope's phones weren't secure, PGP would be a sacrament.

@_subject: NSA technology transfer 
The following was posted on the list in the middle of May.  Being curious I called the number list at Ft. Meade. The person on who answered
was real shaken, for lack of a better term, that I called, it seems that this was the second inquiry that day.  He wanted to know various things, like
where did I get the information, was my name Bruce....  After a few minutes
he finally took my name and said, to call him in a week to 10 days if I did not here from him.  A few day later he called and said I needed to send a letter to expressing my interest in the technology.  About 10 ten days
after that I called to inquire if he received my letter and what was the next step.  It seems that there had been quite a few requests and that they were
trying to determine whether or not they were going to allow the technology to be transferred to individuals. The person said to call back  in 4 or 5 days.  I called today and they said in essence that they were not going to let individuals have a shot at it.  They said that they were going to charge stiff license fees, that you would need to show a plan of how you were going to develop the product.....  You get the It is obvious that they really don't want to transfer the technology.  And if
they do it will be to someone with deep pockets and who they like.
I wonder where the fees that they want to charge will go, to the general treasury or to their own budget? More later.

Network World of June 6, 1994 has a brief article on DSS.  In the article it says that "some firms do not appear worried about legal threats fron PKP.
AT&T, which sells SecretAgent - software that uses both DSS and RSA signatures - has not obtained a patent for DSS from PKP; neither has Information Security Corp., the Deerfield, Ill. bases company that develops SecretAgent exclusively for AT&T."  What do they know that we do not?  Makes you wonder about all of PKP's claims.  Has PKP ever sued anyone over their patents or have they just threatened?  Very curious.

Another book that has not been mentioned is "Alan Turing the Enigma" by
Andrew Hodges.  It gives, what I think, is a good analysis of Turing's
work, alot of which is still classified, what role Hut 6 played (theater traffic analysis, bombe development, and other projects after Hut 6) , and his subquent role in the development computing.
Hodges does a good job of putting Turing in historical and mathematical/cryptological perspective.
Alas, like some of the books that are sugguested, it is recently out of print ( look for it in the remainder/used book stores).
