@_subject: Phrack SummerCon - I enjoyed your talk 
I was there in 'lanta when you gave your talk at SummerCon, and I
thoroughly enjoyed it. I was especially intrigued by some of the, um,
fun you can have with corporations. Are there any books I can read
that are sort of _Fun with Your Corporation for Beginners_?
