The card's easy to cancel, but the cash ain't.  Credit cards are
cleared with the issuer.  Digital cash with smart cards acting as
transaction observers don't need this.  The thief need only transfer
the cash from the stolen card to his own, just like he does with
regular cash.
Sounds like a better choice.

Ok, here was the method of key generation i was talking about.  With the light communications, the idea was to use photons whose waves pulsed in certain directions (up/down, left/right, and diagonally) to create a way toommunicate much like morse code.  The key used to scramble these communications was designed to change the direction the photons of a message pulsated - like changing the characters of a message, scrambling it up.  The key consisted of three symbols, one for each of the possible orientations, and was fainly simple. It was like a one time pad in that the key was never recycled.
The key could be generated by a game of 20 questions, so to speak.  The people at either end randomly generated a key.  Then, they asked eiither indirect questions about the contents of one anothers key (do you have an odd number of up/down symbols in row x, etc), but since the contents of the key were never touched on DIRECTLY, no eavesdfropper could determine the key, and it was ttally secure.
We, obviously, cannot use the photon as a method of communication, not for th e masses.  the undertaking of building such a network from scratch is astronomical.  however, if one wwas to use the orientation symbols in ones messages, as if they were being beamed, but in an email message instead, one could make use of the simple key, and the simple game of '20 questions' to generate a totally secure key in a mater of minutes, depending on how long the message was and therefore how long the key has to be.  Does any of this make Regards, *!Cheese Doctrine:!*

Possibly because a) it is allready being faught, and b) court battles cost money which most folks dont have.  If people are unfamilliar with encryptation, they should do a web search and find out what they can, then use it.  What you are saying (as far as encryptation not being an answer because so few know how to use it) feels like "lets not use a gun to defend our home from intrusion because so few know how to handle them.

There is an easy way to develop a secret key in front any number of eves, be they experts or not, without the eves knowing what the key is.  Even if they tap your phone/comm line, ect.  There was an article in Discovery Magazine a couple of years ago, talking about how to use photons and their randomness as the perfect, uncrackable code.  Use of the photons aside, there was a key generation method discussed, simple, yet secure enough to work out on a tapped phone.  Let me root around.

I think i was misunderstood.  I was not referring to the actual use of light in the communications process.  I was talking about the key generation method suggested in that article.  Of course the use of light is impractical for most - the need for direct fiberoptics aside, you have to be able to test a photon for its polarized orientation.  In any case, i dig on.

Hey Tim-
Just a thought.  When you stated that other countries might be trying to (basically) pretend the holocaust had never happened, because it might NOT have happened and may very well be a big lie, you forgot to consider somthing.  Had the holocaut happened, which i believe it did, it was of such horific magnitude that, since (for a time) we sat back and let it happen, let 6 million innocent people die, we might be trying to forget about it so as to not have to take responsibility for it having happened.  It is much easier to say that it never existed and have no responsibility, than to acknoledge that it happened, and to look at what kind of people it makes us to let it happen.
Just a thought. :)

We /all/ pay for our access.  Most of us work, most of us pay for the paper,
most of us put up with ads.  Spam is the price of free speech.  One must either, in minor cases, ignore it and move on, so as not to encourage; or, in
case of extravagent abuse, send word to the isp, spread the word on the net
that xxx.com is a spammer's haven (and otherwise discouraging further memberships), as well as filling the sysadmin's mailbox until the spammer is
deleted and we can all move on again.
It's not a load of crap, it's reality.  Everything provided for civil use and

Well, look at it from the consumer point of view.  We log on, and see what is
eccentially a junk-email, written as a form letter, sitting in our box.  It's
gotten to the point were I have barely enough patience to skim my junk before
I delete it, just to be fair.  So, to most of it, it seems quite droidlike.  If you want people referring to it in a more respectable manner, earn more
respect.  Do a more personalized canvass, or find better ways to advertise,
other than junk email.  You'll piss less people off, and get more respect.
That doesn't make it right, in my opinion.  It just makes it worse, because
salesmen will not consider how annoying their canvass is to people before sending it out, and more and more people get pissed.  Selling is no justification, the ends do not justify the means.  People are still angered.
After all, you are not counting how many pissed off people you do NOT sell to.

Well, I get the feeling that I am intelligent.  I tested for acceptance into
Mensa, and after finding out my IQ was 156, I felt I had better things to do

I find out a lot of things I didn't know about, and hear a lot of things that
the media isn't going to cover, things called 'rumor' because they don't want
them to be true.
Who knows, maybe we are all dumb.  Either way, it does no good to lament wether
or not we have sufficient intelligence to be referred to as 'itelligent life.'
Personally, I find that it is far more fun to keep on trucking with life, rather
than debate a moot point that we have no control over.

I recall that Tom Clancy, who has written a number of military fiction novels,
for which he has done endless notebooks full of research for, made a statement
about this.  He said, simply, that the TWA jet's explosion was at such an
altitude, that even if someone did it from a boat directly under, it was still
far too high for a Stinger missile to reach, much less dammage.  Just thought
I would throw that out there.
Tom Clancy is not a military-hired brain, but to make his novels realistic and
to do justice to the people he portrays, he does a LOT of research.  He is a
highly respected author, and I have no doubt that his statement is based on
his personal findings, collected for a previous novel.
