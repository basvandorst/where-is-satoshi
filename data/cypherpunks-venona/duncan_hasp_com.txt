@_subject: Remailer list supplied 
As per your request I just set up a mail robot that provides the remailer-list via email.  It is slaved to the finger list at berkeley and gets updated from it once daily.
To try it send email to remailer-list
If mail to remailer.hasp.com bounces try speedbumps.hasp.com
my changes to DNS may not have propagated out to the world yet.
If you reference this server please use the address remailer-list since speedbumps.hasp.com may not always be the host supplying this service.
If you have any questions or comments about this service just email me a Duncan J Watson                         Email: Duncan

The process seems to be from our admittedly thick-fingered experimentation to be as follows:
1) start the client
2) insert the server in the server edit box "sksp.brute.cl.cam.ac.uk"
3) put 19957 in the port edit box
4) push the update button.
5) Select Hal Finney's  SSL 2nd Challenge from the drop box
6) Push the update button again
7) request a small number of key segments (1-10)
8) Select the returned keys and then push the Search button
9) Fill out the dialog box and let the search proceed.
At this point your computer is checking keys.
To view the progress Select options from the menu             the select view searches...
You will see the progress in a seperate dialog box.
This is my understanding.

Your question is very hard to answer as poised.  How is access granted?  To whom?  In what period of time?, etc.
The details are very important here as this is a very detail-oriented list.  Also the details of implementation are where you may find the objections.  Many plans sound grand when loosely described but fail due to small details.
My personal belief is that any mandatory key escrow system will be open to abuse by authority figures.  A solidly implemented key escrow service operated by smart privacy oriented private firms would have benifit corperations and others engaged in cooperative development or other cooperative operations.  Key escrow would keep the accountants and lawyers happy.  Just my $0.02.
