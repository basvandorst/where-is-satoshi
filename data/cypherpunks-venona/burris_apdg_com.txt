@_subject: Re: DL in exchange for fingerprint 
Illinois already has such a law, in fact you must have an SSN to  even get a DL.  Fortunately, the law allows a citizen-unit to choose  if they want their SSN on their DL (imagine that, a choice!) - the  flip side is that you have to specifically ask them not to print  them - they won't ask you.
One would hope that CA's law might provide a similar out...
