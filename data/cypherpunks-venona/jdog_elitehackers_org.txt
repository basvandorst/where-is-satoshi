gee, gcc seems to always do teh trick for me when I want to compile some
Then again, if I was to say linux to you, you would prolly run in ph33r
... so, why don't you call bill up and ask him to send you a free version
of Visual C++.... so that you too can crank out useless winblowz code...

hah.. the fact that you are claiming that you are going to write a
"program" that will combine all the good /h/p/v/c apps out there and
combine them into one is simply ridiculous.. what you are claiming is that you are going to write a program that will
have builting crackers, sniffers, DoSes, Tone Generators, Virii creation
utils, box plans...etc. This is absolutely ridiculous...
just for the record, what would you consider the "good /h/p/v/c" apps out
there? the uberl33t winnuke.exe.. or perhaps maybe the k-rad linklooker..
it is ppl like you sho seriously make me wonder where society is headed...
ok hippy.... why don't you sport your /<-rad pvc pants and vinyl shirt and
talk smack about how you are the uberhacker....
I think you have seen Hackers the movie one to many times there acid
hell ya I laugh at you... either you are too big of an idiot to reaalize
that you are being made fun of.. or you are to stupid to care.... at any
rate, kill yourself... you are breating air I might need someday....
Not running linux as of yet? hehe so when are you gong to do a search for
linux.exe and start to run it?.. as soon as your superkool P2 266 gets
here... wowwie... I am impressed...... Hey DK.. pass me another beer...
fucked up lingo? gee, I am very sorry if your small mind can not make out
my words.. but I can assure you that this is NOT fucked up lingo... go
read some h4x0r Br0s and then tell me about how fuct up my lingo is....
btw... congrats on your really kool superl33t juno.com account.. you are
r33t now.
