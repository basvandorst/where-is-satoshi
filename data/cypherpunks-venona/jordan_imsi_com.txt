Hey, I have a PowerBook too, but don't say you're limited to one serial
port.  You could use the desktop bus, and there are extenders
available.  I do agree that a parallel box wouldn't do me much good on
my Sparc.  For a while, my IPX was my "portable" computer, albeit with
monitors on both coasts.  But the box itself is quite lugable.  If I
wanted to, I could plug it in along the hallways of airports and use a
palmtop with a serial connection to read mail and up/down load ...

All the more reason why the signature should be in the envelope (i.e.
one of the headers in 822-land, in the p1? part for X.400, etc), not
the body.  Where did this convention of signing at the bottom come from

@_subject: Re: Why mailers should not touch the body 
I got lots of mail telling me that signing messages in the body of the
message came about because "various mailers" munge header lines.  Now
it's true that for gateway processing, To: and From: lines need to get
translated, but I've never seen a mailer change or remove a header that
doesn't have to do with addressing before.  Can someone provide an
example?  My claim is that a signature belongs on the envelope and not
in the body.
To be clear, I'm talking about (e.g.) a PGP signature, not a .signature
with a cute saying in it.

There is no question: those who were paying for the (quite expensive,
relatively low bandwidth) connection between the US & Australia found
themselves with a saturated link and looked for a "good candidate" to
shut off.  It turns out that lots of the packets are mail, and a good
number of the mail messages were going to/from the anonymous service.
This was not a move against anonymous e-mail or the research into it.
This was just an abuse of "someone elses money" that was easy to

Anyone get very far with the CELP stuff yet?  I forget: is it or isn't

These are examples of transactions that are *ongoing* and thus are
*not* satisfied by an initial cash payment.  When you rent a car or
hotel room, the transaction does not finish until you have left and the
room has been inspected.  At my mailbox service, I can incur charges
for all kinds of things (receiving COD packages, receiving faxen, etc.)
during the term of my rent.
No, the credit card says they can recover damages if you trash the room.

Banking and Tax regulations provide solid legal ground for requiring
banks to verify identity and Tax status in the US.  Answer: no.  By
definition, there are no "legitimate" reasons for having a checking
account in this country that is unaccountable.  There are plenty of
other ways of hiding cash and money transactions without involving the
US banking system.  They don't want you to do this ...
No, you're just avoiding the accountability of your money.  This is
akin to not reporting income.  It's patently illegal.  You can stand
down your color PostScript printer now ...

Banks need your SSN (at least) for being able to report to the IRS
anything they are required to report.  This can include interest
payments, but also includes things like making cash transactions of
more than $10k.  Bank accounts *must* be fully documented in this
country.  Switzerland, and certain small islands have more lax rules.
The USA does not.
Privacy is one thing.  Money is another, at least in this country.

[ maybe you're kidding? ]
The way those old coots leave their money to their cat is to set up a
trust with an executor (human) who pays the bills incured by the cat.
The cat never actually receives money, just services that are paid for
by the executor.
This is silly.  You must (under US Banking Regulations) provide a SSN
to open any kind of account.  This includes (but is not limited to)
non-interest bearing accounts.  Any bank that would open you an account
without proof of who you are is asking for a lot of trouble.

Why do you continue to think it's "your" account?
If you want to have such a thing to call "your account" you're welcome
to plunk down some $$$, buy a machine, get yerself a network link, and
remail to your heart's content.  If I were another CS student at UB, I
would be bummed if the scarce (by your account, and by most others at
universities) cycles I needed to get my homework done were being given
away to folks all over the world via a remailer.
That's all those machines need is more sendmail processes running :-)

I was involved in a slightly different news war a few years ago.  I was
being harrassed by a particularly prolific news poster (at one point he
represented nearly 9% of the total USENET weekly volume), and it turned
out that I was running a site that had an NNTP feed to his site.  I
talked with the admin there, found out their fan-out plan, and made
sure that anything I got from them got fanned out as soon as possible.
Except I would modify the message in subtle ways, like change the
attribution line from something like
Anyway, I was able to make my version of his postings "the" version by
hitting all the other sites his site fanned out to first.  It was fun
for a while until he found out and tried to mail bomb me.  Fortunately,
I was around when it started, and put a reflector in to send his bombs
back automatically piece by piece.  His machine was a lowly VAX 750
running some backwater rev of 4.3 alpha-alpha, and sendmail promptly
sent the load to 40 and crashed the machine.
His PhD advisor was not amused.

@_subject: Re:  The Magic Question 
I live in NYC, and am often approached by panhandlers.  Approached is
the wrong word, I guess I mean that I walk past them.  Every person
that walks by gets asked the same question: have any spare change?  I
choose to give to charity for a variety of personal reasons, but I
typically don't respond -- at all -- to requests from panhandlers.  I
don't look at them or respond verbally to the question.  Every now and
again, when I don't respond at all, I get an insult fired off at me --
like, 'You could at *least* say no' or somesuch.
I feel that so long as there's no reason to believe that the question
is an "honest" one -- that is, there's nothing to signal the start of a
conversation or a "relationship" ... I am, afterall, just walking by,
and the next person behind me gets the same appeal -- there's no reason
for me to respond, let alone with the "truth" ...
I believe that answering a question like "who are you" can and should
get different answers depending on the depth of the "relationship"
involved.  Is the question poser seeking some sort of "truth" ...?  A
"name" is simply a label, a tag, something to indirect through to
access the "named" ...  I'm sure we all know people whom we've called
"Jack" the entire time we've known him, and suddenly one day we see
Jack in a different situation and someone calls him John.  Has Jack
(*our* Jack) been "lying" to us?
One year I spent a summer at a visual arts workshop with a group of
people who knew nothing of my past, and I was sure not to know them in
the future (10 years later, I've had no contact with any of them).  We
gathered in a circle on the first day of activities and introduced
ourselves after the leader read our names off a sheet.  When my name
was read, I just ignored it.  My name was read three times, and then
the leader went to the next name.  At the end of the list, she asked
"was there anyone whose name I didn't call" ... a woman put her hand
up, and so did I.  The leader took down our names, and we continued.
That summer, I was "Nick" to everyone at the workshop.  We worked in
very close quarters, and the group of 40 or so quickly developed the
kind of "trust" that's required in such intense situations.  People
needed to count on one another, and often spent sleepless nights
together working on projects, helping each other explore their vision
and response to the work we were doing, and generally becoming
"friends" ...
Inevitably, I was drawn to intimacy with one particular woman.  It's
one of those things you suddenly find yourself in.  We shared many
secrets, dark nights, heat.  In the end, I was "found out" by some
other of the staff.  It's not even clear how many people "knew" all
along.  Even the staff member I worked closest with could have known,
but for whatever reason never said a word.  The fiction was nearly
complete for 12 weeks.  I did not intend to defraud, the "truth" was
consistant.  When word passed around that Nick was not my name, some
refused to believe it.  Some approached me later and started with "Nick
... er, Jordan ... er ... what do I call you?"
I said it didn't matter to me, and most chose to call me Nick for the
remainder of our time together.  I received a few letters from that
particular woman, a christmas card or two.  I had to tell the place
that receives my mail to look out for mail addressed to Nick Stames and
route it to my box.  We continued a correspondance, sharing some bits
of the next phase of our lives, and she continued to call me Nick.  I
was, afterall, Nick to her.  That's who she "knew" ...
Why do you care "who" I am?
