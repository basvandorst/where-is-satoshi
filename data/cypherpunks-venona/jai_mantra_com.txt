Forgery is a crime and such acts are not justified.

Yes, the removal of data from computer networks
through forgery is a crime. People who do so are criminals.

It is not a good idea to impose censorship on others by
supporting the laziness of Paul Pomes.

That is like saying "by decreasing the human population by mass murder, our resources are conserved."  Censorship
is not justified by stating that it causes the information
to be reduced so as to lighten the load on a network.
Unanimous consent?
What constitutes "due notice" in the present context?
If an ISP were to advertise "Newsgroups censored through
forgery", then that would be "due notice".
Given the proposed "due notice" above, ISPs with such administrators are not likely to attract many customers.

While there is a tendency to reconcile atrocities if they
are perpetrated long enough, there is serious doubt that
forgery and censorship are among them -- no, not in a world
that is beginning to learn about true freedom.

The commission of crimes such as forgery and censorship is not an acceptable excuse to stop the flow of information, even if the free flow is perceived by some as a crime.

That's ridiculous.  One shopping for an ISP, without
access to the Net, is not in a position to read a
notice in a newsgroup.  It makes sense that censorship
and forgery advocates would also suggest means of hiding
the truth.
Again, if an ISP were to advertise "Newsgroups censored through forgery" -- in electronic, print and broadcast
media, or wherever advertisements are placed or material
made available to investors, then that would be "due notice".

The faact that an ISP supports censorship takes away
the "decent" qualification, thus invalidating the
other premise and whatever else was built upon it.
That is unacceptable since the users would have already
paid for the account by that time and signed a contract.
