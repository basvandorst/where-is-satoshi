CYLINK CLAIMS SHARE OF RSA TECHNOLOGY
An arbitration ruling has awarded Cylink Corp. control over two Stanford
University patents on public-key encryption technology used by RSA Data
Security Inc. following the dissolution of the companies' five-year
partnership.  Cylink says it plans to seek royalties from companies that
have licensed the software code from RSA and are redistributing it.  The
arbitrators ruled that RSA's right to sublicense the software expired in
1990.  (Wall Street Journal 19 Sep 95 B7)
