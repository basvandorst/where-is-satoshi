Does anyone know of C source code for low speed CELP or vocoder
software available on the net?  I feel if we can develop even a low-speed software based answer to
the secure-phone, it will probably be used and distributed to many
people.  I think it would have to be based around the soundblaster
card though.
Perhaps we can also devise an internet secure-phone standard, and
clients can be written for NeXTs, Suns, PCs, and etc.  I've had no luck getting our SparcStations to decompress ADPCM encoded
Internet Talk Radio in real time...either the software I have is truly
sad (could be), or we need to look at other compression methods
such as CELP, or at worst, vocoder.

@_subject: Dining Cryptographers test bed client for IRC 
I wrote up a short "test bed" for Dining Cryptographers over IRC (Internet
Relay Chat).  The implementation is not secure, as it uses PRIVMSGs to
exchange flips between neighbors, but some good soul with a bit of time
could go in and add DES encryption to them. The client allows for anonymous roundtable discussion between clients on a single IRC channel.  The key-sharing graph is a ring, so it only takes two to collude to find what a particular person is sending, but that can be expanded also.  There is no collision detection, but it is usually pretty obvious (i.e. if you send something and don't get it back, you know a collision happened).
I also included a paper which has some discussion and references to making the DC implementation better, including things like protection against attacks coming from the IRC server itself, protection against someone sending stuff all the time disallowing service, etc.
This has all been put in the cypherpunks ftp incoming directory.

PGP has made me more crypto aware, but at this point neither I nor most of
the crypto aware people I personally know feel there is a need to either
encrypt or sign messages on a regular basis.  While this doesn't do great
things for supporting crypto, it is simply reality.  DigiCash is a
different situation of course - it is needed, and as soon as possible.

That's true to some extent.  I'd love to be able to have every message I want signed and encrypted from PINE automagically.  I could implement this by requiring keystrokes at the editor level.  But that isn't the entire issue...
On the issue of signing, there is another question.  Do I really want
to sign every message?  I don't like signing my written name anywhere I
don't have to.  And whenever I do, I am careful to look at all the
potential consequences.  Signatures imply I am agreeing to some kind of
contract.  Perhaps I prefer my email unsigned, to give me a level of
disputability.  If my email was a business contract, then I'd be
enthusiastic about signing it.   But for a post to a political newsgroup, for instance, perhaps I don't want to make sure everybody can cryptographically assure themselves it comes from me.  This leaves me open to potential forgery, but email forgery is well known and understood.
Finally is physical security of keys.  If I am going to sign anything, I want that key to be under control of only me.  It is difficult for someone like me who uses workstations to keep a key only on floppy, especially as I find myself on different workstations, many diskless, all the time.

The 14th Amendment ensures that states shall not infringe on all "privileges and immunities" of citizens of the USA.  The Slaughterhouse cases created an interesting judgement that the 14th is not talking about all rights of American citizens, but only those coming directly from citizenship, thus the Supreme Court must explicitly "incorporate" parts of the Bill of Rights via the 14th Amendment to the States.  While freedom of speech has been "incorporated," the right to trial by jury has not, and neither has the Second Amendment for either individual right to keep and bear arms or collective (state government) right to keep and bear arms.
It is pretty obvious the 14th was established to limit the ability of State's to infringe on the civil rights of blacks.  After reading the Slaughterhouse cases, I side with the dissenting Justices and feel that it should apply to all rights mentioned in the Constitution.  But that isn't the law...

You certainly need some kind of encrypted secure checksum (MAC) to ensure message integrity.  I don't think you have to go through the entire authentication of the principal.  (Though as V.

Now if you are talking about simple denial-of-service (detected tampering
or traffic flooding), that is another more difficult story.

I've written a test-bed IRC client which uses DC Nets to allow multiple people to talk on an IRC channel anonymously.  It operates in a ring, with every participant showing his/her random bit stream with the neighbor to the "left."  Participants compare their bit stream with the one their neighbor shares with them, and broadcasts the differences (with lies indicating xmitted "1" bite) to all participants.  The difference bits for each round are totalled together modulo 2 by each participant, and any anonymous broadcasts can be determined from those My implementation was a quick project for a class and lacks some really important features:
1)  used built-in PRNG
2)  does not encrypt private messages for bit stream sharing between 3)  no ALOHA or similar protocol for dealing with message collisions
4)  ring could be expanded to more complex graph to increase number of
    colluding participants needed to break anonymity.

CATO STUDY RELEASE
September 7, 1995
National ID card ineffective and intrusive, study says
Congressional Republican proposals to create a national
computerized registry and an ID card for all American workers
would establish "a dangerous, invasive, and unworkable new
expansion of federal police-state powers," according to a new
Cato Institute study.
In "A National ID System: Big Brother's Solution to Illegal
Immigration" (Policy Analysis no. 237), John J. Miller and
Stephen Moore say Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) and Rep. Lamar Smith
(R-Tex.) are taking the "critical first step" toward implementing
a potentially invasive national worker authorization system. Moore is director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute,
and Miller is vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity.
An Orwellian system
The authors say that Smith and Simpson want to require an ID card
and computerized worker registry for the 150 million Americans
and legal immigrants in the U.S. labor force.  Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.) wants that national ID card to include such
information as a photograph, fingerprint, and retina scan.
The study says such a system would, in effect, "require employers
to submit all of their hiring decisions for approval to a federal
bureaucrat."  The authors call the proposed registry and national
ID card "Big Brother's solution to illegal immigration."  They
say the national ID card would
    constitute a massive invasion of privacy and violation of
     basic civil liberties;
    cost the government $3 billion to $6 billion to implement;     subject workers to the effects of potentially huge error
     rates, with perhaps millions of legal aliens denied jobs
     because of faulty government databases (even a 2 percent
     error rate would lead to 1.3 million Americans being
     wrongfully denied jobs);
    increase discrimination against Latin and Asian Americans;
     and, ultimately,
    fail to affect illegal immigration.   Moore and Miller say that, once established, the computer
registry could be easily expanded and applied to other areas,
vastly increasing the size and scope of government. Some of the
potential uses of the system include
    implementing a Clinton-style health care plan and security
     card;
    ensuring employer compliance with affirmative action
     requirements;     tracking child support payments;     verifying that parents are getting their children
     vaccinated; and     conducting background checks on would-be gun purchasers,
     among others.
Better approaches available
After spending a year defeating the Clinton administration's
health security card, Moore and Miller say, the new GOP Congress
now wants every American to carry a "work authorization card"
that would create similar potential for intrusion and abuse.
The authors claim there are ways to address the problem of
illegal immigration that would expand, rather than curtail,
Americans' basic freedoms.  We could, for example,
    expand legal immigration quotas,     eliminate employer sanctions law,
    establish greater economic integration between the United
     States and Mexico,     restrict welfare eligibility of legal and illegal
     immigrants,
    facilitate the deportation of criminal aliens,
    tighten visa control, and
    improve border enforcement.
Why it matters
It is an iron rule of politics that whenever there is a perceived
"crisis" in Washington, Congress responds by passing bad laws
that expand the powers of government.  Moore and Miller say the
immigration issue is fertile ground for such laws. The
implications of a national ID system would range far beyond
today's debate over illegal immigration. The study says the
proposed worker registry system has no redeeming feature. It will
not curtail illegal immigration, and it will create opportunities
for abuse. At a time when Americans are loudly demanding more
freedom and smaller government, Moore and Miller say a computer
registry is a giant step in the wrong direction.
