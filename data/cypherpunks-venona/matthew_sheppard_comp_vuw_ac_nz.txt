[ lots of purely subjective arguments that frequent alt.security.pgp ]
Frederick can you please tell me why I should belive thttpd is secure.
I don't accept the ability to compile it myself as evidence and I
don't accept a summary of that source written in english prose on the
basis that it has no hard link what so ever to the source.  It was
also written by the authors of thttpd.
You should find this argument hauntingly familiar.
You state that crypto should be poved correct and suggest a technique
otherwise known as formal specification.  I agree, pgp should have
been written in Z-specs.  If you take a course in formal specification
you will soon see the intractability of the technique wrt large
I'm sorry, the english prose your team writes holds no extra formal
credibility over trust.  It demonstrates more study - but has not
proven security.
If you want prople on this list to repeat after you "I cannot be
certain there is no compromising bugs or backdoors in X" Then I will
go out on a limb and say everyone here will agree if system X is
sufficiently large.
p.s X = thttpd

I stipulated I didn't want any such garbage, I specifically said
english summaries are not acceptable and you bombard me with them.
Yet you wont accept others opinion of PGP's security, which verbal or
other wise, can only be an abstract summary.
piffle! Your words:
This sounds like performing a formal analsis to me.  And you didn't
address the intractability anyway.
The work in automatic theorum proving is ongoing and not limited to
your grad student or your work.
I said showing by english isn't good enough, proving would be
fantastic.  I don't believe these issues reside solely with pgp and as
such you should question computability as a whole before using
"incomplete specification" in accusing one system to be flawed.
Your tiresome repetitive question was "Why do you belive X is secure"
I herby answer exactly as above "I cannot be certain there is no
compromising bugs or backdoors in X"

A generalised distributed compute server would be powerful, a
participant would only have to compile the server and ensure it's
running.  It would compile and run cracking code only if signed by say
four principal participants.
The central coordinator service would want to send the following
instructions (every communique would be signed & checked):
Just an idea, probably old.

It isn't simple, you need to know the absolute address of where the
supplied code will be and alter the return address on the stack to
that address.
With NCSA HTTPD 1.3 and with fingerd (re internet worm) the stack was
always in a known state when the buffer overwrite occurred, thus the
absolute address of attacking code is static and placed at the correct
stack location.
With Netscape 1.1 the state of the stack is much more dynamic, in
particular the user can be viewing documents at an arbitary depth in
the "web tree", each recursion will increase the stack pointer (or
decrease with some architectures) There is no way of knowing for
certain where you code will end up and thus no way to reliably alter
the return address on the stack to execute your arbitary code.
You could always gamble on popular states, like when the first url
fetched by the browser.  Also you could direct execution to any
routine in the netscape binary (with unknown arguments) .  The most
detrimental offhand would be deleting the bookmarks file (whoopee) And
with Netscape 2 comming RSN I wouldn't waste too much time.

Well beta2 is heaps better than beta1, I can still crash beta2 with or
without java under win3, sgi, solaris and alpha but it has to be used
for a longer and few crashes are repeatable.  Plus lots of new gizmos,
the certificate authority interface (thanks Jeff).
I've got to note just one thing -- what about the Netscape LiveScript
language?  is it opening up the same security can of worms as java?  I
realise that it provides functionality specific to browsing only (no
network/files) but the potential for bugs when you add another
language must increase.

The shadowy figure took form and announced "I am attila and I say ...
Just had an idea for Netscapes case.  If we suppose that the ITAR
governors ever managed to agree on a purely electronic based, export
controlled distribution method then Netscape can write a Java applet
or LiveScript to perform the task.  This would mean a *click here to
download* interface and bypass the obfuscated process that dogs MIT

To obvious really, if they signed strong foreign crypto MS would
neither be exporting strong crypto or exporting an application that
had general purpose crypto hooks, since technically only that specific
foreign implementation could be used.
However I would guess that the arrangement with the guvmint would
label the signing to be the equivalent of MS exporting an application
with strong crypto and subject to the same disciplinary measures, just
transfered to the time of signing.  Perhaps there will be some
modification to the itar - thou shalt not _enable_ foreign markets to
have strong crypto.
I assume MS would be free to sign weak foreign crypto, but as "weak"
crypto is hard/expensive to determine I think they would take the easy
way out.  Id also expect a kernel patch to be part of the install
procedure of foreign crypto.

Aside from memory management in java being internal to the virtual
machine as covered in other posts  Java is a strongly typed language.
There is no notion of void * (pointers that point to anything) and the
current implementation ensures the pointer is either null or valid.
Even if you could the current implementation disallows any pointer
arithmetic at all! i.e no pointer++;
Also if the object your pointing at is destroyed your pointer will be
updated to null or you will generate an exception when you next use it
as per the bargabe collection policy.
