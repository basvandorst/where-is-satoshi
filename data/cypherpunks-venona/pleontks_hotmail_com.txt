Have you ever realized that this list is for straight-up (used loosely) The government is not planning to murder everyone.  The Government is not keeping aliens in the 'basement'.  The X-Files are not real.  The government is not murdering public figures, and setting-up pore, civilian saps to take the fall.  The only thing that the Government is doing is running our country the best it can.
All you are doing for the Government, is finding fault and conspiracy in every action.  You are destroying the Government, and are thereby destroying America.
By even being a part of this list, you are confirming to the mindlessness that you so hard are trying not to do.
None of you have my pity.  I spit upon you all.
