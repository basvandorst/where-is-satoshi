1)Read the FAQ (sorry.. don't have the address for it handy.. Tim, ya got
 2)Read up on crypto, politics and economics.. mighty dry reading for most,
but damn    useful around here.
 3)Practice safe encryption- Use PGP or any other encryption you are
comfortable with.
   But be sure to always use it. (Wrap that data)
 4)Develope a strong urge for privacy and then strongly fight to protect it.
This means
   you may have to write letters to Congress and the Senate, may have to
defend yourself
   to non-crypto orientated folks, and so on..
 5)Practice what you preach, and preach what you practice. Share the
knowledge with
   anyone who is interested..
 6)Send $10.50 to me for the genuine 'Cypherpunks Starter kit' which
includes a cheat
   sheet of really cool Jargon, a pair of black sunglasses, and high quality
laser reprints of the FAQ..
   mail that to: Cypherpunk

I have to disagree here.. There is such a thing as overstating the obvious.
And a statement such as the one you propose is definately in that range. If
the user is knowledgable about system ops that come from external apps, such as the PS
interpreters, Java or whatever, then they should take appropriate security
measures themselves. If they are not skilled or versed in such subjects, you
can bet they will be after the first incident of 'cyber-vandalism'.
Ignorance is not bliss, and you, and only you, are responsible for
protecting yourself in 'cyberspace'.
Heck, I can see it now:
       "Sex can be used by sufficiently knowledgeable
        sustained physical activity, voluntary dehydration,
        and who have removed all other known, unknown, and/or         undisclosed partners from their systems.  Otherwise,         sex unsafe and should not be attempted."
Again, overstating the obvious...
