If you work in GF(2^m), you can use a normal basis representation
which allows you to do much faster math.  Squaring, for example,
becomes a simple rotation.
There are also very efficient algorithms for computing inverses and
solving quadratics.
These speedups currently account for most of the performance
improvements which elliptic curve systems offer over their
integer-field counterparts.

About twenty basis points with respect to dollar volume.
