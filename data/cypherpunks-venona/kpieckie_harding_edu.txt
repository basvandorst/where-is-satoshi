Due to the high volume of mail from this list, I rarely get to read every
message that comes through here.  Thus, I ask a reply be sent to
kpieckie directly rather than through the list.
Please forgive the interruption if this message is slightly off-topic.
The library here at Harding University is attempting to set up some
internet computers that run Netscape only and do not allow access to
anything else on the computers.  We use a scripting program called Flute
that hides the Program Manager (WFW 3.11) and reloads Netscape when it is
nuked with Alt-F4.  Another program removes the ability to use any of the
netscape pulldown menus less help.
The problem is the keyboard.  If a user hit's Alt-F4 after Progman has
loaded but before the Flute script executes, Flute is terminated and the
user has access to the computer.  Are there any programs that will disable
Alt-F4 and Control-Esc in Windows?  Where can they be attained?  Freeware
is preferable, shareware is fine, trial period is required for commercial
products.  Thanks.
