There is another level of *menace* which I suppose many of you are unaware.
The queer newsgroups of usenet, have been experiencing waves of net-terrorism for the last couple of years. I don't mean the usual
mean-spirited or dogma-driven type of uninformed posting that echoes the stereotypical stuff we are used to dealing with in daily life. Nor do I mean the occasional *ALL FAGS SHOULD DIE POSTED IN ALL CAPS FROM SOMEONES ACCT THAT THEY LEFT LOGGED IN ON A PUBLIC TERMINAL AT AN INSTITUTION OF -ahem- HIGHER LEARNING*
I mean people who exploit insecure sites and networking skill to forge
mail and articles as part of a concerted and ongoing campaign of
Stuff that has resulted in very serious consequences.
Theres no need to go into detail here about the array of tactics and
the widening scope of the phenomenon, but I think it needs to be looked
at as an example of how and why systems are abused.
If anti-social immaturity can easily find shelter for puerile behavior,
then any socipathic agenda or ruthless competitor can do likewise.

soc.motss and other newsgroups have seen a long list of pseudo-persons
posting from non existent sites, and yes.. penet has been used to this

I think that there is no shortage of contributing factors to the
shortcomings of network distributed ascii based communication.
Bottom line is that when we have our full range of auditory clues,
and visual context, we use all of that and more in order to convey
meaning, and in network distributed ascii communication the clues and
context are missing unless we *spell it out*.
Most of us aren't that diligent or patient.
I think it is interesting to also note that people will engage in
levels of flaming that tehy would never do to another person face to face. That is also a form of non-acountability by being unreachable
when your content might otherwise earn you a fist in your face.
Personally, I believe that some levels and forms of anonymity are highly desireable. Reality is that some levels and forms of anonymity
are too easily subverted by sociopaths who don't care about the consequences of their acts, or the restrictions that may come about
due to their abuse.
Not to get too far past the scope of mailers and netnews, but
these issues have importance to the growth of Networked commerce
in general.
I think that the design of privacy systems needs to take these
dark-side issues seriously and do their best to minimise the potential
for abuse. If for no other reason, where there is money, there is abuse
and criminally sociopathic predators who will do anything in their
power to gain advantage over their competition.
Perhaps a *zoning* concept is needed, in such that transactions would
have qualifying conditions - or in such that *zones* exist as data-space
with authentication qualifications for *entry* or transaction.

There are three personas in particular, who stand out in the crowd, they are:
The Dark Knight
    Obvious psuedonym, claims that he was disciplined or fired because
    the nasty queers on soc.motss complained to his management about
    his honestly stated opinions. during two periods of his unwanted
    attentions and homophobic ranting there were several serious sendsys     bombing incidents. I know of one in which an SGI employee was     mail bombed with enough garbage to clog their whole mail system for
    quite a while.       Interuption of net connectivity to a whole company in order to     amuse some creep who fancys himself as a fag-bashing super hero,
    fits my definition of sociopath, and I suspect that if it happened
    to any of us, filling up our disk real estate, delaying our business
    as usual, we would consider it a serious situation.
    I'm not sure how many there were, but during the worst phases,
    there  could be two or three such incidents per day, involving     gigabytes of data.
RALF, or RLF
        hangup over his birthdate , pretty much your basic
        testosterone poisoned megalomaniac.
Dr Artimus Page
        the roving gangs of hetero-bashers who are out to get him.
    In another incident from that same period an individual was     targetted who did not have a very understanding employer,     he was fired as a result.     A very serious matter for the guy, who's life got turned     upside down because he was the target of these acts.
    Sendsys messages would be forged, ton_o_byte mail bombings would be
    forged in the name of other soc.motss regulars, usually those who     posted uppity responses to these *honestly stated opinions*.
    Punitive repostings of months of back traffic     Oh.. yes.. there were denials.. but the common factors between
    all three of these guys and the harrasement
    showed more than a casual relationship between the appearance of
    this character and patterns of e-harrasement.
There were occasional other minor players who would come around, usually
obvious forgerys from accts claiming to have been succesfully cured
by the sagely Dr Page, and trying to date the Lesbians in order to
help them too.
Rarely would more than one be present at a time, they seemed to run
in a patterned sequence that has consistently covered the last two years.
A good deal of it starts as nuisance stuff, forged addresses, forged cancelations. And you can look at sendsys and mail_bombing as the functional equivelant of ordering pizzas or other deliveries to a third party, but I see it as a pattern borrowed from terrorists,
purposeful and repeated , intent to wear down the spirit, and keep
their prey on the defensive so recovery doesn't happen. I have no illusion that it takes a rocket scientist to pull off these
stunts, nor that given the state of our net,  anything can really
be done to stop it now.
However the real world effect was that the real
people of soc.motss were subjected to severe psychological harrasement,
of the type that wouldn't be tolerated for a minute in real-space.
That we currently have no choice but to tolerate it in cyberspace is
not an acceptable prospect. Having experienced the personal cost of
this sort of thing on my own psyche, I can tell you that it is maddening while it is going on, and sobering  afterwards when you realise how vulnerable you are.
There are others of course, actually quite a few who are more than willing
to display there ignorance from their real accts. Why I bet some of 'em
probably are on this list.
lets see.. heres just a partial list of proud defenders of heterosexuality
who find it amusing to taunt the queers on soc.motss.
Daniel J Karnes, Walter Smith, Gary Lang, Ted Kaldis, Clayton Cramer,
and more.. many many more.

oh .. of course, I'm only arguing for diligence and design criterea
that will buy us optimum freedom, and minimise opportunity for abuse.

Well.. I suppose that in the case of commerce, the vendor will, and that market forces will ultimately detrmine the succesful strategys.
Think of it in terms of reliability, and trustiness. Accountability
optimises both, anonymity diminishes both - in fact can potentially
dispense with accountability. when your transaction involves value
don't you want reliability and accountability? I do.
If providing my identity as collateral for reliability is required in
some transactions, I think thats reasonable to offer as an option.
I tend to think of cyberspace in terms of the UnReal Estate business.
If I have some data space, then I think I should be able to determine
who gets in and what they do there.
regarding common data-space and whether there should be rules and accountability, would you move yourself or your family to a neighborhood where you couldn't determine who gets into your place
or hold them accountable for what they do there?
Perhaps you have a higher opinion regarding the negative aspects of
human nature than I.

In all seriousness, we are rapidly approaching enough multimedia
saturation that we will also have sound file formats, picture file formats,
animation and video formats which can all be used as vehicles for
homowhatever schemes. Have a text to speach application record your words into
a sound file format, and apply some of your crypto wizardry to make
it into weird music, use rhythym tracks mixed in as convincing cover
and maybe some harmonic riffs as a red herring to keep snoops from realising
that the file might not be what it seems to be.
how about encoding real time video signals used in desktop vid-conferencing.
and slip encoded documents into the picture as colorful border graphics.
Govt snoops tend to act out their information gathering rituals like  squirels that have eating disorder, they can't find enough empty holes to fill with nuts (ie: important data ) that they might need to analyse later.
so instead of trying to be elegant, be pigs. Bloat your content with
obfuscated bric a brac, and banal tracts on technical issues that put hard core nerds to sleep. Our net-universe has vast resources
to tap for source material to be used this way.
Solid Engineering technique and clever hacks applied to your

so .. the dummy file you pad with, you'd just have one?
or do you mean you'd make a new one each time?
it would get pretty obvious if the same file kept popping up .
I guess you could claim to have obsessive compulsive disorder and
that this file is your obsession?
If you really want to buffalo them  you would need an intelligent
agent application to compose dummy text for padding that would be reasonably unique each time.
I would think that if you could write such an agent it wouldn't be much
more work to have it encode whole words with other whole words and apply some linguistic formula, leaving the encrypted file looking
like an ordinary, and uninteresting file. It might even be fairly simple
to apply a word exchange scheme similar to the classic mentalists routines
before encrypting the file, thus obscuring the meaning while still allowing
the gestapo to feel that you've complied satisfactorally with giving them I find that left brain analytical types tend to only apply left brain
methodology and thinking in their designs. Throwing right brain
methodology into the equation could add just enough incongruence to
the process that it might serve to confuse the shit out of the cryptographer trying to make sense of it through left brain analysis.
In fact it might serve to heighten the incongruence factor  when the crypt-breaker is a two-left-brain type..  present company

You may also find that such gentile methodology as attempting to sway
opinion or unfairly weight ones opinion in order to alter the flow of disscussion are the least you can expect.
I bet that clever sociopaths will find ways to leverage anonymity
schemes to accomplish mayhem of magnitude well beyond these sort of things.
believe me, you don't want to find out by being subjected to such mayhem, and if it happens you will be much harder pressed to come up with ways
to patch things than if you take time to try and deal with it now.

How about *credentials* that certify the capabilities or flag the potential dangers of a binary object.
Aren't there schemes out there that hold promise for that sort of
*trustworthiness* stamp of approval?
Aren't such schemes prone to the potential of cliquish abuse?

I don't think it's ironic, I will be disapointed if the cypher-head
community doesn't pay attention to the disphoric aspects of the technology it wields. Would you like to be the Edward Teller of cypher ?
I don't think so.
I want privacy too, and I want as much free-wheeling as possible in the
matrix. Personally I think that accountability is going to be required
as the price for reasonably secure encryption, reasonably open access,
and reasonably secure privacy of data. IMNSHO, it is unreasonable to expect an anarcho-libertarian outcome to
these issues. If you can prove me wrong I will be thrilled.

focus in this group regarding text.
It seems to me that multimedia extensions have an *unfolding of the lotus*

Fine, spend your time in a network of this character.
But I'm trying to inject some real world values into this issue.
Heres a clue, when your just playing games, this scenario is fine, when its
bigtime finance, industrial secrets and intellectual property with high
value, and the process of managing these things, you will find that reliabile security will be the number one requirement. In my opinion, Accountability will win over anonymity if it comes down to a choice.

The comercial use of internet is growing at a very fast rate, and it is predicted to overtake other uses in scope eventually.
wide scale networks provide capabilitys which are very attractive to
a variety of business enterprises.
I suspect that a first pass will be made to try and use internet and the current suite of protocols and services as they are now.
I also suspect that such attempts will flush out a whole raft of problems and
deficiencies along with  those who exploit such things.
Hopefully new protocols and services can be developed which will minimise vulnerability and maximise protection for bussiness assets while allowing
us as much freedom as possible.
Nobody really knows what those things will be, and it is sorta problematic to make public laundrey lists of vulnerabilitys without some sort of idea
how to deal with cleaning up the mess. We are going to have to learn by My main point though is that eventually business will find decentralised
anarchic networks to be hostile territory, and will move on to less
vulnerable, more reliable networks where user authentication, and accountable security are provided.
It may be that there will be barriers between the anarchic networks and
the business-place networks,that require users to provide proof of identity
before they can pass.

seriously.. note that you asked "because of the medium itself".
It's multiMedia, thats jargon for multiple mediums interacting with each
other, and presenting data interactively on multiple fronts.
It means an unfolding from two dimensional thinking ( text) to three
dimensional thinking ( virtual reality ).
 >  > I also see very little regarding potential for breaking the mind machine

 > Uhhhh, OK.
perhaps you are unaware of some of the more starling things that are being done with biofeedback interfaces.
but even more simply than that..
lets take something mundane and achievable like hand gestures sensed by
the data-glove.
you want to get a privileged message to a colleague. If you can both access a data-space in real time and view an interactive simulation
of each other in a prileged manner that insures no one else can capture
and render either view, all you need to do is communicate via
ASL or even a proprietary sign language, via the dataglove interface.
this is very doable.. right now.
let the Intelligence analysts chew on that!
BTW, that scenario was suggested to me by an individual of my aquaintance who lives on the other side of the --uh-- tracks.
he was very keen to be able to have such privileged communication,
and cost is no factor to him, he pays in cash.
(I should point out that I turned down the offer to contract the
we are about to enter into an era of computing that provides quite a bit
of potential to evade surveilance just because of the sheer multitude
of possibilities. This is what is really driving those who want to do
surveilance mad. Don't be surprsed if the ultimate result is draconian
restriction in order to reduce the odds that are currently in our favor.
Don't be surprised if you see your decentralised anarchic net go away

But the reality is that no matter how much some of us would like

However if they forged your name on one of your checks, you wouldn't

And in such a case you have an opprtunitty to prosecute them for
their criminal act of forgery should you be able tpo prove it.
Digital signature systems need to include the ability to track and

phade to more general rant...................................
I am finding this situation most enlightening myself.
It directly parallels the situation that I outlined regarding
the electronic version of Fag bashers in the queer newsgroups, and the subsequent e-terrorism that has been perpetrated against myself and other
admitted homo-sek-shuals who don't take any shit from homo-haters.
Larry has simply created a campaign against a different un-natural lifestyle choice, the perverted and obviously criminal desire to remain anonymous. (thats satire BTW)
Showing us how to harangue your target with the techniques of mindless
prejudged bigotry, and how they usually only engender more of the same.
(ala *my mind is made up, don't confuse me with facts)
It reminds me of some things I've seen all too often in other corners of the the subsequent flame wars that ensue from the use of inflamatory terms,
(in this case the spoof word. Made more poignant due to the similarity to
the british slang word poof.)
the inevitable escalation of miscommunication that occurs between
people who are talking *at* each other rather than with each other,
the reality that electronic freedom still requires some forms of accountability,
the fantasy that anonymity makes you free,
the irony that those who expand their gripes against individuals as
foolish campaigns against whole groups of individuals, are engaged in destroying the very freedoms they claim to be defending.
(kinda like sawing off the limb your sitting on, to keep others from
sitting next to you!)
and that ultimately the only punishment available to an online personality
for transgression is exclusion.
(so far)
To those who wrote to me a while back, telling me to get a thicker skin,
and learn to deal with it. I can now say,
just get over it.
To those who didn't understand the logistics of gaining concensus regarding
how to deal with such situations, I am eagerly awaiting your guidance
to show me how its done.
I think this issue points out the need to develop systems that foster
a better quality of communication in a medium that hampers quality at the
expense of ease-o-use.
I think that examining this situation as an example of a much wider
problem will illuminate some of the points I tried to make some months ago.
It is my opinion that the situation regarding the use of anonymous systems
to harrass and terrorise queers on the net is a laboratory for the study
of this issue. Ignore it at your peril IMNSHO.
And I think that if any group of people on the net is qualified and capable
of dealing inteligent solutions out, this is the group.
I think you gotta widen your focus and recognise the broad issues
before you narrow in on the specifics, I don't think that solutions to the issues involved can be integrated at the end of a patch-work
quilt of solutions that only get implemented after the fact.
In short Detweiler isn't the problem, he has merely provided you with some examples to chew on.
So go ahead, chase him away, perhaps the next case will not be one that
just involves simple neurosis, perhaps it will be full blown psychosis

Ok, but this is a limited view.
How about the individual who stands N+1 units away from you, where N is the
length of their arm, and repeatedly swings at you. Even though you
both know that the +1 satsifys your *entitlement to not be hit*, it
certainly seems to be an assault of some sort.
So, OK, you have the right to turn away,
but now the attacker moves to a new position, maybe only N +.5 this time,
and each time you move he countermoves. You are still in no imminent *danger* .
But you are being subjected to unwatned harrasement.
In such a case it is reasonable to demand your privacy from being subjected
to the harrasers atentions.
Now add to this the factor that the perpetrator hides behind a pseudonym,
and has taken measures to insure he escapes any accountability for the hostility and willfull harrasement. He uses multiple accounts to bypass
Kill files and filters, while rationalising his campaign as his right
of free speach, god-granted vigilantism against crypto-sinners, and
merely a graphic representation of his humble opinion.
this is essentially what has been going on in soc.motss for years.
This is essentially what is going on in cypherpunks with the Detweiler
I am seeing exactly the same range of individual responses to Detweiler
as i see in soc.motss to *dark knight* and *artimus* and *Ralf*.
I don't think this is a coincidence.
On cypherpunks, the list management has the right to cut him out of the list, and thus stop him from receiving list-messages.
However, he can still mail to the list and continue to offer his opinions on it,
even if he is not a recipient. Sorta like standing on one side of a wall and lobbing grenades over the top.
Trust me, I understand the progression of these things, i've seen it
happen over and over. I have grown a thick skin, but I also keep notes.
So OK , the list management can hack filters to *not re-transmit*
messages from his account, getting past such filters is easy.
In fact forging account adresses is easy, so the next step is to send his opinions from forged adresses, say - as Hal Finney, Or Perry Metzger.
There is no accountability for this sort of thing, and until there is
these systems are unsuitable for anything but conversation.

I think a better, and non-political, model is the Astrum Argentum.
The A./.A./. is a masonic style hermetic organisation.
A secret society if you will.

no I cannot tell you how to contact any part of it.

and the OTO, otherwise known as THELEMA, offers us a glimpse of
how the future is unfolding.
To those pragmatists and engineering types who scoff at Magickal organisations and its members, I can only say that I truley believe if you look without prejudice - suspend disbelief - and recognise the key nature of the basic underpinnings of hermetic philosophy, you will
see that *the mysterys* are laid bare all the time, and are no mystery
at all, but rather good common sense.
Cypherpunks above all others should easily understand that it is possible
to code information in such ways that only those who have the key can
understand the hidden message (esoteric) while all others see only the filler text ( exoteric).
Protect the mysterys, reveal them daily.

One can think up all sorts of hypothetical scenes.
Underneath it all however, I believe is a simple axiom.
When prevention methods thwart a criminals intent, they find new methods.
Car alarms and security systems didn't convince the criminals who make their
living ripping off cars that the *Good ole days were over* and it was time
to get a  job at Burger Sri, it spurred them to find new methods to ply
their trade.
Beyond that it didn't bother them to up the ante regarding the level of violence they would utilise.
Now extrapolate that into the concept of industrial espionage, white collar crime, and put everyone on the same wire.

Watch the nightly news or if you want to be really anal about it look up statistics about the increase in violent carjacking.
Walk down the street in any San Francisco neighborhood, and count the piles of tempered glass that used to be car windows.

Recently a Cash machine was installed in a building which I frequent.
It was placed 10 feet inside a plate glass window, and has easy access
for a small truck to drive up and haul it away. It even has wheels.
I noted that this presented a danger to those of us who were in the building
late at night, since it was apparently so vulnerable.
I was concerned that the unarmed security guard was a sitting duck,
and perhaps target practice, for theives intent on driving through the window and quickly hauling the whole shebang away.
The cash machine installer informed me that the unit had a cel phone and GPS
that would call and give its location if tampered with, but he didn't have
an answer when I remarked that this would be littel comfort to anyone
shot or injured by thieves unaware of this factor.
and please don't tell me that posting signs telling would-be criminals
about these security precautions will do any good.
They won't.

You are making an error if you think that any locks keep out anything
but honest people.
Necesity is the mother of invention.
The point is that these issues are not linear, when implemented in real
world situations you must consider the real world implications and provide real world solutions.

WE have met the enemy and they are us.
What I hear you saying is that crypto-anarchists will win, and thus
replace the governmement as we know it. ( or perhaps transform the govenrment

Strong crypto in the hands of the individual leads to this scenario.
Thats why strong crypto will be reserved for the privileged, and kept
from those not connected to the power-system.

Is there a question regarding whether they *can*?
Of course they *can*, they have more weapons, and  a history of using them.
Don't you really want to ask other things like what happens when/if they do?

Our nation is criss crossed with super-highways, but there are plenty
of folks who prefer to stay on the back roads.
Its awfully hard to build competing highways where folks can drive
their un-registered vehicles, because the real-estate involved is

Whats that old saying about Death and taxes.

I think it is unwise to use linear thinking to try and deduce what the ultimate outcome of this complex equation may look like.
