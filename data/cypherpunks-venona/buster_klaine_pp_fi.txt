Excuse me - what the f**k is this?  Does it bear some truth in it
or is it just a bad joke? If it is not a joke where to get the damn
text - thanks. Sorry for the language but this does  sound just
the thing I have heard some rumours of and which certainly
would result in banning strong crypto.

Scientology people are not behaving so I take a standing
that I don't have to behave when I treat them as well.
Good, remember they started it ...
Sorry to hear that Mr. Braan
O camoon - that name sounds great what's
inside it? Research department of Brainwashing?
Wast that the technology you tried to sell
to CIA? And luckily CIA told you to piss off.
We would need a list of all legal offices representing scienos in all countries. Also does anyone has a list of top scienos
and some kind of organization flow chart of this evil Does anyone has tel number to these Co$s?
Good - you have civilised police there.
They wan't a war - well let's give them one! I don't mean this
bashing in the net - I mean a REAL WAR! Co$ has been on
offensive for some time now and they must be got to the defence mode.
I think it would be a jolly good day if they would try that against me. I would make best of it...
Screw with their permission.
Sorry for the raw language but I get so damn angry when I even see
these scienos mentioned. To fight them we need an organization to fight them. Todays
situation is like uncontrolled and thefore unoptimised guerrilla
operations. Results will be weak.

Well they are just doing what their charter says they
should be doing - gathering information.
I think that's because White House workers has access to net and of course they are surfing like all the rest of us
- they are just people you know :-) If that would be part of something hard level information gathering
I assure you they would not leave so clear traces.
So are you saying White House by itself checked out those places
or are you saying that *people* working inside the White House
happened to be interested issues available on those sites and accessed them. And so what it is public information when it
is on the WWW - isn't it?
My guesses are
Probably both Probably to read it and maybe learn something from it :-)
Hell I am keeping my own records and on the other hand I am in the
process to get/buy/snatch/built a system where I could automatically
scan all the newsgroups with some kind of AI system and to keep
an eye on certain FTP, GOPHER,WAIS, WWW and so on to keep
me bether informed. This partly because this information from interne is getting out of proportion AND quite a big part of it
is just rubbish and wasting your time. Probably they do and they really should. If I was Mr. Clinton (which I luckily am not) I would want my adjudats to prepare a report for
me each morning summing up all the possible comments round subject Clinton and The USA from NET: That would be very precisious
source of feedback to finetune your acts. And that information is real time.
Totally another thing which somehow belongs to this subject
should intelligence bodies watch for the net.
I am middle reading Spycatcher book. Btw I don't understand
all the hype rouund it and I would say in that book there is
not enough substance to ban it's printing in certain countries.
Anyway again in that book it becomes clear that the most
riskiest part of the agent and therefore on of the best way
to unweil them is to concentrate on their communications
with the coordinators in that particular country or on the communication directed to country behind the operation.
So clearly to make agents more succesfull their coummication
is the one needing new techniques - how about internet?
It is accessible almost everywhere and you can get an account without giving your real identity. By using certain
sites you just call in from telephone box give few information
or in some places none and you are ready for almost totally untraceable communication. I bet they are using
it already a lot to replace clumsy readio communication.
Don't get me wrong I vote for freedom of speech(whitch is getting slimmer), privacy (witch there is not much left), no regulation on encryption (which is not going to be)
but I don't like these things used against my country's
security and steal our intellectual property.
Based on this I tend to think every self respecting intelligence organization must have those taps otherwise they are not doing their job properly.
Truman might have been one of the best presidents US ever had
but talk is talk and deeds are deeds.
Comments and reasoning is totally my own imagination my employer would propably disabprove them and
certainly not they don't represent my employers Be carefull out there ...

Hi Dounglas,
We are selling both uti-maco SafeGuard Systems GmbH and
uti-maco Belgium products here in Finland and haven't had any problems with the licences whatsoever. Naturally
you have to fill in certain blankets and get the permission
but that's same kind of a procedure no matter what European
country you would be buing cryptohardware and software. I will forward your message to uti-maco Belgium so that
if there has been any misunderstanding they can sort it out.
Of course my opinion is biased but uti-maco Belgium is doing
top notch crypto libraries and hardware. That intelligent (own processor) cryptoboard which has RSA/DES chips on board
is great for any software company wanting to include REAL
crypto in their products. Also what makes their implementation
especially usefull is the easy and clear API for programmers
and that the implementation is scalable to different throughputs without changes in the API. Also the possibility
in API calls to decide where a certain operation should be
done is a nice feature. So if there is a smartcard connected
to a machine all the secret key operations would be done on
the SC not with the software. So uti-maco Belgium stuff is one of the best available in Europe. The other big supplier for these things is Crypto AG
in Schwitzerland. In Finland there are two companies who might
have what you are loogking for, Setec Oy, in Helsinki and Instrumentointi Oy, in Tampere. The latter one at least have a nice encrypting
bridge (includes also some routing and filtering capabilities)
with a better algorithm than DES (I understood other
algrithms would also be available than their own). I don't have the contact information at hand now but let me know if you need it.

I find it in a way amusing that a country which
have very weird attitude towards use of crypto
(it is not allowed to be used) tries to set standards and provide new technology. If they
are that opposing to use of strong encryption
how on earth they can be providing it to others

catch in it?
Maybe it is the difference in internal and
foreign policies but still I suppose a country is supposed to be spying or sorry gather information
