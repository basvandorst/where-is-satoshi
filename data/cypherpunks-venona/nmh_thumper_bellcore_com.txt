Let me add one vote of support to your proposal ... and another
reason you may not have considered.
I use PGP for personal communications.  I'm not a big enough
target for anyone to sue.  On the other hand I do *not* use
PGP for anything related to my employment.  My company (Bellcore)
is large enough to get sued, and everyone loves to hate the
telephone industry.  As a result, I would happily pay a resonable
license fee.

That means your office is served by a PBX.  With PBX service you
have some incoming trunks and outgoing trunks (technically they
are lines, but let's ignore that).  The number of lines in your
company is much greater than the number of incoming and outgoing
The ANI data is the line id of your outgoing trunk. Incoming calls
must pass your extension id and connect through an incoming trunk.
