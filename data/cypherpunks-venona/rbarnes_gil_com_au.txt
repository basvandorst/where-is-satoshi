Congratulations on your decision to moderate this list.
My bottom line feeling with respect to this is that we cannot
expect freedom unless we are willing to exercise responsibility.
It is apparent that the people who are noisiest about freedom of
speech and content censoring are working tirelessly to abuse
the list and provoke the very opposite of their stated ideals.
As for the spammers who have run riot in recent months,
moderation will remove the burden of re-transmitting this unwanted
garbage from the list server and save us all the time and effort
currently wasted dealing with it.

My understanding was that there would probably be more than one
moderator, also as Sandy's moderation decisions will be open to
scrutiny by interested members of the list I cannot see the list
membership accepting unsuitable moderation decisions, either by
Sandy or anyone else.
This list has a purpose, lets get back to it.

I would say that there had been a lot more than "some of that".
I believe that moderation as proposed does not really limit
anyones Freedom of Speech.  After all the list is intended as a
forum to discuss the topic of cryptography and it's use by
society, the list is not advertised as a free for all abuse
forum or an unlimited conduit for spam.
If you want Freedom of Speech go stand on a soapbox in your
local town square.  Would you complain that people who choose
to walk on by and not listen to you are violating your right to
Free Speech?
Cypherpunks has the right to say "Enough, take the raves, rants
and spam somewhere else".  You are free to say what you want, but
if it is off-topic, I don't want to see it in my inbox.
You will certainly be in the minority, but you are right,
the choice is yours to make and everyone else's as well.

So does this mean that when you say "faggot" you mean
"a person with views different to your own" rather than
"a male homosexual" or "a bundle of wood, used for fuel"?
I think not, a code sample from a "faggbot" would be more
helpful than a rule of thumb.
