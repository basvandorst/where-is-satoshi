I had the same problem - I believe it is to do with a new flag PGP 2.2 sets
in your public keyring (see documentation). I solved the problem by executing 'pgp -kc' which checks the contents of your keyring. After that PGP
worked fine, although to be honest I'm not sure why.
Hope this helps.

Re: possible problems with INT13
I may be mistaken, but I have this feeling that DPMI servers (including
MS Windows) react unkindly to people using INT13. This is certainly what
the Borland Open Architecture handbook says. If your program is resident
when such a server is running, it could throw up a General Protection
fault. I will check into this myself...
