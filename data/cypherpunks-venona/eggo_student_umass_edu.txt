@_subject: PGP: Elm patch question 
I heard some discussion on here a while back regarding problems
getting the Elm Perl scripts included in 2.2 to work correctly.  I too have
had this problem, and have very limited knowledge of Perl.  Did anyone ever
get something working smoothly?  I've munged around with the script in

     Actually, it's almost entirely the cables, and somewhat the screen
(CRT, that is).  A shielded CPU box isn't going to be giving off really any
appreciable amount of RF waves, certainly not enough to read coherently.
An LCD will help, since they don't emit the same kind of signals (no CRT),
and no cables going to them.

     To my knowledge, none of those publications are still being put out.
However, all of them (with the exception of TAP, which was a paper 'zine --
although they did put out one online issue) are archived at ftp.eff.org, in
the /pub/cud directory.

being done with cracked accounts, or someone is distributing the
script around, since the original messages came from
pbergman while the latest batch (I got 3 this morning),
came from a different netcom user.  (Apologies for not having a name,
I misplaced the posts.)
one, as one of the people listed in the headers of the mail is
emmanuel the editor of 2600.  Thus, I think this is
more for harassment of him than for any kind of serious attempt to
have peoples' accounts rifled.
to alt.security.pgp is obviously a spy/kiddie porn collector/secretive
serial killer/UNABOMer/etc., and takes it upon themselves to notify
half a dozen people of such?
