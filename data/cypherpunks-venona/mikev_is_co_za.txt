Surprise, surprise.
I think it had to happen sometime :-)
I'm sure we will find out in a few years that Microsoft invented the

early demise.  Or all of the above.

Hi all
I can just see the FBI screaming "we need weaker encryption to combat
terrosism on US soil" with nasty effects -- it seems all to many people,
lawmakers included, will be only to happy to sacrifice their privacy that
the FBI can better combat these terrorist acts (which could *of course*
could been prevented had only the FBI been able to read their encrypted
Somehow I got the feeling watching CNN that the FBI was given a shitload
of ammo. Call me cynical but the Reichstag fire comes to mind... "Those that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary

Not really, because when you generate a key, you generate a key, two are
actually generated: one public and one private. The public key you give to *everyone*, put in you signature, in the
newspapers and in your .plan; wherever. You also then have a matching
private key, which you NEVER give out.
Now the mathematics are pretty simple, but I'll pass over it.
Essentially your public key will decode what your private key encrypts
and your private key will decode what your public key encodes. So if someone uses your public key to send a message to you, only you
can decode it, since ONLY you have the matching private key.
This is used for signing as well. If you encrypt your message with your
private key, only your public key and decode it, since ONLY you have the
matching private key, if your public key, which everyone has, can decode
it, then ONLY you could have sent it. So to sign and encrypt a message
to someone all that happens is you encrypt your message with your
private key and then again with their public key. And it will be signed
(only you could have sent it) and encrypted (only they can read it)
I should mention at this point that pgp handles all this, because it
sounds very complex and time-consuming. To encrypt a message you simply
pgp -e PrivateLetter.txt sasa.roskar
--> call pgp [pgp] and encrypt [-e] a message [PrivateLetter.txt] to the
recipient [sasa.roskar Pgp will look sasa.roskar
up in your own public keyring and use that public key. Signing is just a
matter of saying -s as well
Hope this helps, and is accurate.

Hi again :-)
Changing the from header is easy -- load netscape and change your from
addy... Or else you can telnet to port 25 of any given smtp server and type help

The INSTANT one see's the words "unpublished algorithms" appear in the
context of cryptography one knows that snake oil is being purveyed.
Resistant to all known forms of cryptographic attack?? Words fail me.
Quite right. I'm not a "real cryptographer" myself, however I do feel that
many people on this list subscribe to a similar set of values and are
equally angered by people who sell snake oil to unsuspecting people.

You have GOT to be joking. This isn't happening... I can't believe I just

Hi everybody
Heh! This one's good for a laugh :-))
Seems the DOJ hack was a good inspiration. Heh! Life's good when you're
willing to work at it.
