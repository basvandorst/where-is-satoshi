Look at the signators and judge for your self. When I look at the people I
trust through one level of introducer, I find I have a very high degree of
confidence in their identities. Two introducers out, it still looks fairly
good. I have not looked farther than that. It is the limit of my trust.
In many ways it is easier to establish the authenticity of a pseudonym than
a verinym. The only question with a pseudonym is whether the nym who posts
is the same nym who posted last time, and the time before that. If, over
the course of a year or two, there are no attempts to spoof the pseudonym,
then the key will have become well connected with the nym. That is all that
matters. Even if a "Sameer" has posted for years, I still have to worry if
the person's real name is Sameer (given the current understanding of the
meaning of a signature on a key).
I once refused to sign a key because I thought the driver's license was
forged, but I would be likely to accept a better forgery at authentic. I am
at least as confident of the identity of Uni as I am of many of the other
keys I have signed. The only ones I have more confidence in are those of
long time close friends, and family.

@_subject: Re: Transitive trust and MLM 
I like this. The most obvious attack on key signatures is to cross sign a
huge number of bogus keys, is of no benefit. As the density of this
bugus-clique increases, it comes closer and closer to acting as a single
entity for trust calculations. Then your trust calculation for any key in
the clique is simply your trust of the real key which signed all the bogus
ones. It should be no time at all before most reputable key signers cut all
links to that key.
Another nice property of this calculation of probability is that it
automatically drops off exponentially with the number of links (at least
along any one chain). We need to think about how much we want multiplicity
of paths to bolster our trust. Here is the scenario I want to avoid:
  Mallet creates a large number of keys: A, B, C[...]. C is a large set of keys.
  A is the Key Mallet uses publicly. It has a few signatures.
  B is the key Mallet uses to sign keys who's trust he wants to boost.
  In addition to signing B with A, Mallet also signes all the C[i] with A, and
  signs B with all the C[i]. This multiplicity of paths should not boost the
  trust in any key which is reached through this complex.
In general it may be difficult to decipher which paths you want to follow
in multiply (and cyclically) connected paths.
I suppose one approach to this would be to pick various ways of calculating
trust, and see if anyone can come up examples to attacks to exploit them.

room for one, two, three coins, but there is no guarantee that the payment
will be made with only that many coins. The current API is going to be high

No, it is not in the key block. It would be passed during the negotiation.
Call me paranoid. After asking and reading around I decided I wanted to
cover my bases. It looked like, in the future, it might be easier to break
with small generators. This is not a critical decision though. I too would
have liked it longer, but using RSAREF I am limited. That is one of the
reasons I have each remailer creat its own DH modulus, and allow it to
change it periodically.
You have spelled out why I like having each remailer use its own modulus.
I chose C. The in protocol I developed the sending remailer (A) sends a
hash of the DH modulus to the receiving remailer (B). If B has it, they use
it. If not, A sends it. I use the modulus from A because it has the stake
in privacy. B will take messages from anyone, but A wants to know the
messages it has goes to the correct other remailer B.
Here is a description of the protocol I wrote many months ago. The message
assumed the above discussion of distributing the DH modulus.

Our options will open up alot when the patent expires next year.
I agree it does not make much difference mathematically, but one DH modulus
always makes me uneasy. DH is still patented though. I think I will continue
to use RSAREF, but compose the standard so the protocol supports unlimited
key sizes.
For now I think we might just suggest that the operator keep a big PGP key
to sign new key releases with. Key management is a whole nother thorny
issue. I would love to see that whole part of Mixmaster reworked. Some deep
thought should go into managing and distributing keys (it was almost an
afterthought in my design).
It is something to consider. Right now the software is not that flexible,
but it should be in the next major revision. I too would like to move from
total MD5 dependence.
Mixmaster recognizes type 1 messages, and passes them to a type 1 remailer.
Socket support for type 1 is more complicated. The known RSA key is now the
PGP key which encrypted the message. It is going to be a lot more
complicated to go in a get all the info needed using PGP. Given a PGP
library it could be done within Mixmaster, but it seems outside the scope
of the program. My personal feeling is that as Mixmaster improves and gets
more widely ported, type 1 should phase out.

I quite like this load based cover traffic scheme. Another defense against
flood is to slow the rate at which the messages leave the system. A simple
modification to Mixmaster (which will be in the next version) is to have an
exponential pool. The operator sets two parameters, a minimum pool size,
and a fraction of messages to send each time the pool is processed. 10
messages and 10% seem like good settings to me. Given at least one cover
message each time the pool is processed, flooding is much less productive.
A side benefit of this system is a reduction in the load on the sendmail
system during a flood or spam.

Mixmaster prevents replay, so flooding multiple copies of a single message
will not work. This is the reason Mixmaster has no reply block feature. I
can see two ways in which replies can work safely.
One time reply blocks. Each block is used once and only once. Each routes
separately, and the creator never deploys enought to allow a good trace (no
more than 5 in existence at any one time). They would probably need to be
managed by some kind of nym-server. They have the disadvantage of allowing
denial of service by simply using up all the available reply blocks. The
block also point back to the sender (as all reply blocks must). This allows
an attack to rubber hose each operator in succession at the attacker's
leasure. Normal chains contain no information about where they have been,
so interception and cooperation must happen in real time (much more
The other solution is message pools. I think this will turn out to be the
only really secure and reliable system. Some sort of automated use of pools
by remailers (so the user need not do so directly) might be possible. I

One important differentiation to make is filtering on form vs. filtering on
content. Most if not all remailers have clear usage guidelines. These
indicate several form restrictions on what messages the remailer is
offering to transmit. These restrictions may be on message size,
instruction formatting, number of destinations for one message, or number
of identical messages. These restrictions are no more censorship than
restricting messages to SMTP compliant ascii.
Where people do not follow the stated rules, I take action to enforce them.
Either by source blocking the abuser if known, destination blocking the
destination, or trying to apply public pressure. I think all these actions
are completely reasonable, given that the proper use guidelines were
clearly defined up front. It is similar to putting up a fence around your
yard when people start hanging out there uninvited.
Of necessity most remailers also restrict some content. This is very
difficult to enforce, but is generally done for legal reasons. I restrict
illegal and harassing posts. Since I don't see the content, these
provisions are largely unenforced.
Are you suggesting that I not take perfectly legal and open actions to

President of Infonex, the list is in no danger of being pulled by the
administration of this site. As the author of Mixmaster I am reasonably
well known (and I hope respected) member of the list. I have been
completely uninvolved in the politics which have plagued the list of late.
I personally favor the multi-node list model, where no one site can censor
the list, the loss of any one node is not catastrophic, and the load on any
one machine is not excessive. Unfortunately I don't think it will be up and
functional in time for the transition. I have already set up the list on my
majordomo server and subscribers are welcome now. The list address is
cypherpunks and the subscription address is
majordomo The list on my server is subscribed to the
unedited version of the current cypherpunks list. Once the multi-node list
system is perfected I will integrate this list with the other nodes.
Having dealt with the abuse heaped on remailer operators, I think I have an
inkling of what John Gilmore has withstood for years. He has agreed to
forward his list to mine (and possibly others) for a while after the 20th.
It is my opinion that the primary Cypherpunks list should be completely
uncensored and unfiltered. An ecology of filtered lists has developed in
exactly the way many predicted they should. For the record I regularly read
only a filtered version of the list, and subscribe to the full list only to
be able to read referenced articles which were filtered.

I have alt.cypherpunks on my server (all 1 message). I would be happy to

But they had better not offer the servce over here. In any case, it is a
trade mark whether registered or not.

I really don't understand this reaction. We asked Antonomasia nicely to
rename his remailer. He very kindly agreed. The Trademark registration has
been filed, but not yet approved. It is a long process.

SSH and a remote shell account can solve this problem. If they close port
22 it is time to change providers.
Cyberpass  provides anonymous shell accounts and SSH.

The risks of allowing pasted From: lines far outweigh the benefits. Pasting
of From lines makes remailer operators much more vulnerable to charges of
fostering forgery rather than simple anonymity.
Spam baiting is another obvious risk. Forged postings with deplorable
content will bring down retribution on the forgery victim. Forged From
lines can also be used to subscribe victims to thousands of mailing lists.
The uses of this "feature" can be duplicated with other mechanisms such as
nym-servers, which provide persistent unique From lines without the
possibility of forgery of arbitrary addresses. Users desiring greater
security can simply point the reply capability of the nym server at the
nearest /dev/null.

I am very glad some helpful anonymous individual forwarded this note to me.
These days I only read a filtered version of the Cypherpunks, although I
host one of the unfiltered nodes, and Dr. Vulis has been in my kill file
for some time.
I am a bit startled at his assumption that because I charge for my services
that I would bend at the first sign of trouble or pressure. Allow me to
clarify my business interests. The Mixmaster software I created is free and
licensed under GNU Copyleft. I do not and never have charged for the use of
the Mixmaster remailer I run at mixmaster At this time
we charge for anonymous ISP accounts, shell accounts and web hosting, and
for the Anonymizer. I don't think anyone would every expect me to offer
free Internet services with technical support. We also charge for
unrestricted use of The Anonymizer (a free unlimited trial with 30 sec.
delay is available to anyone). We did not want to charge for use of the
Anonymizer, but the advertising supported model for the service fell
through when advertisers turned out to be smart enough to see that the
whole point of The Anonymizer is to keep them from gathering the data which
is the whole reason the like to advertise on the Internet in the first
place. The Anonymizer is not like a remailer in the resources it consumes.
I have run remailers from home machines over 14.4kbps modems. The
Anonymizer will overload a T1 (up to 1000 ms ping times) by its self. This
translates to approximately $2000 of generosity per month, more than I can
afford by a wide margin.
As to my ideology, I think the fact that I run many of my services for
free, and the rest with a limited free option, and that I could double or
triple my income if I closed shop and went to work for someone else, speak
for themselves.
As long as privacy tools are free and run by hobbyists they remain, on the
whole, toys. Fees allow me to have several people working full time to
provide technical support, software development, and other services.
I think anonymity is important. I have thought so for many years. I have
put my time and efforts where my mouth is. I think that my contributions
have not been insignificant. I hope that the public feels that privacy is
important too, or I am wasting my time. The fact that they are willing to
pay for strong privacy and anonymity shows that they do.
Dr. Vulis' attack on Sameer was much worse than his attack on me. It is
totally off base. Sameer handed off most of his "privacy ISP" business to
me. The reason for this was not that it was failing, but that the software
side of the business was so much more successful. About half his efforts
were going toward a service generating about 10% of his revenues. Not to
focus his efforts would have been very poor business practice.
I don't care to be involved in long flame wars, or pointless and endless
arguments, so I will not be following this thread on the list. My record,
reputation, and positions are well documented, and easy to research. Anyone
who wants the truth should have no difficulty finding it.

System load is the issue in this case. If a proxy becomes publicly known
the load it imposes on the system could quickly become gigantic. In
addition we found that people were setting up proxies on any old port,
sometimes causing all kinds of conflicts.
Our accounts are priced assuming light personal usage. Running servers on
our systems is negotiable.
