Presumably this won't affect the non-US keyservers.  I don't see the people
running said servers bowing into pressure about a patent that doesn't
affect them....
The thing is, though, that PGP 2.5 *doesn't* infringe on the patent,
because of the use of RSAREF.  Any version that uses RSAREF should be legal
from that patent sense.  Presuming that there aren't copyright issues
involved with the 2.5 release, I don't see any reason that code couldn't be
maintained and fixed.  I'll have to check the copyright status on 2.5 when
I log on.
There are many people, including myself, that won't get involved with an
infringing version of PGP.  PGP won't get "wide" acceptance until the
isssues are resolved.  At the same time, PGP also won't get "wide"
acceptance unless it is interoperable with the outside world.  This would
involve code using RSAREF coming legally into the US and being used, or
code using RSAREF being illegally shipped outside of the US.  Apparently,
the latter has already happened.  But either way, for PGP to be
noninfringing in the US, it needs to use RSAREF.
I'm guessing that the new version of RSAREF they announced would be coming
out will probably alter the terms to make this difficult/impossible.
However, I don't believe there is any requirement we use the latest version

This may be blasphomey on this list, but I don't have a problem with the
restriction on obscuring the meaning of transmissions on the amateur bands.
My reading of the rules (and I'd probably double-check with the
appropriate persons at the American Radio Relay League before doing so) is
that cryptology that doesn't obscure the message, like digital signature,
is permitted.  After all, the encrypted portion of the message is easily
computed or decoded, so its meaning would not be obscured; it just couldn't
be generated by anyone else.
This could be a solution to a problem I've always had with the digital
amateur radio operations:  the ease with which someone could be spoof.
It's very easy to configure your system to transmit with the callsign of
another, or even with a non-existant callsign.  This is possible with wired
networks as well, but requires access to the machines or cables on the
network.  With wireless, you can do it from anywhere, and as long as you
keep connections short, not get tracked down.  With digital signatures, it
is possible to authenticate every message, or even better, every packet,
and ignore unsigned message/packets.
Getting a ham radio license (within the US) is fairly simple.  You take a
test the questions come from a pool which is public knowledge, pay the
volunteer examiners ~$5 to cover the cost of the test(s), and wait for the
FCC to send you your 10 year license.  No fee for the license itself, and
no renewal fee.
Given the public nature of amateur traffic, I don't see a problem with the
restrictions.  There is no such thing as "private communications" on the
ham bands.  Never has been.  If you want such privacy, use one of the
commercial bands where it's allowed.

What I would like to see is low-level digital signatures on the level of IP
or AX.25.  IP is doable, I would think.  There's swIPe, and amateur packet
drivers for Linux, but to get people to really use it, you'd need to put it
in the software or hardware they use, like KA9Q (Hi Phil) for IP, and
AX.25.  Would it be possible to fit this into AX.25?  I don't recall that
much about the protocol, and all my packet reference materials are about
300 miles away.

While I am a ham, I'm not directly on packet radio, so someone who spots
something incorrect please speak up.  I'll probably be getting the needed
equipment within the month.
I would think machines would need to be identified.  Every packet contains
a callsign within it, identifying the source of the packet.  This is often
the only criteria BBSes on packet radio will discriminate callers.  You can
change the callsign transmitted with a simple command to the TNC, and thus
easily forge messages.
Another situation this could solve would be the ability to log into a home
machine without compromising the security on it.  Your password must go in
the clear, but if the packets are digitally signed, it would be difficult
for someone to log into your machine using a replay attack.  I had
considered one of the challenge/response credit card devices out there, but
someone could still break in by waiting for the chalenege/response to take
place, and then send their own packets seemingly coming from the host that
answered the challenge/response.
I would say drop packets that are supposed to be coming from a signing
source that aren't signed or have a wrong signature.  For example, the
local BBS would have listed that N2KGO uses signatures, and has a key on
file.  Any packet destined for the BBS with my call with a abscent/bad
signature would be dropped.  You need to keep the ability to respond to
unsigned packets, though, since not everyone will switch at the same time,
or switch at all.
This one is a toss-up.  One of the main characteristics of packet radio is
its low bandwidth.  A message digest on individual packets would probably
take up more space than a digest on an aggregate group of packets, because
the function should generate the same size digest either way.  However, if
testing a group of packets, and the signature is wrong becuase of an error,
you now have many more packets to resend.

But keeping it on your home machine, the bad guys could break into your
house, set up a keyboard monitoring program, and get it that way.  Or if
they wanted to, grab you and force you to reveal your key.
It's not black and white.  There are degrees of security.  I keep my
encrypted secret key on dunx1, a UNIX box used by many other people.
Anyone who has the ability to can either watch my keystrokes, probe through
memory to retrieve my key or message, or probably a few other things I
haven't thought of.  The benefit, though, of being able to decode messages
as soon as I receive them, and being able to send encrypted messages when
I'm not at home is major.  For me at least, it's a fair trade-off.
There isn't anything I send right now that I would find particularly
embarassing should it become public knowledge.  If I did get into that
situation, I'd probably create a second key pair for use only at home, and
keep both in use.
The bad guys will almost always be able to get your key.  Even if they have
to get you to get it.  The goal is to raise the difficulty such that they
aren't willing to do it.

I would suspect because your copy of metamail, which elm's MIME handling
requires, isn't configured correctly.  It works fine for me in elm, and in
Eudora.  If you don't like the way elm calls out to metamail, you can set
the NOMETAMAIL environmental variable (under csh, "setenv NOMETAMAIL"), and
elm will show the messages without calling metamail (which means you lose
MIME capabilities, but if that's what you want....)
The optimal answer is a better MIME reader, but......

I presume you mean quoted-printable mail messages.  Some mail readers do do

Use the "setenv NOMETAMAIL" I mentioned earlier.  I thought you used Mac

I suspect that most people on the list have worked with PGP at some
point, simply because of the nature of the list.  I don't see a
problem with signing/encrypting to Cypherpunks for 90% of the people
that contribute.
How about just an annoyance responder that sends a piece of mail to
people who post without signing/encrypting, telling them they should
be encrypting, that it's the preferred method of doing things, and to
do so in the future if possible?
As a side note, if you want people to sign their notes, why aren't you

No.  I could see the argument that PGP is bringing crypto to the masses.  I
can't see it bring crypto-awareness to the masses.  In order to find and use
PGP, you have to already be concern about privacy and cryptography.
Netscape, on the other hand, by popping up the alert that this traffic isn't
being encrypted, and may be evesdropped, is and will get the common folk to
think about data security and confidentiality.  A lot more people will probably
use Netscape than PGP, and the people who use Netscape are the people to whom
the wonders of encryption need to be shown.
As to whether Netscape's crypto is good or bad, I'll leave that to the
chest-pounding "IETF is life.  IPSP should be all you need to be happy" folk. Personally, I'd prefer a standards based scheme, and it looks like the NCC folk
