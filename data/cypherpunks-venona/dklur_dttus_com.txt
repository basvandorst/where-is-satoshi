Is the Cafe e-cash system different than Mondex? If so, how?
     Also, does anyone know when the Mondex trial will start in Delaware?

     If the CAFE card contains cheques (which are not digital cash, and      therefore must be tied back to a customer's checking account), how can      the bank blindly sign them?  The merchant will have to deposit the      cheque in order to transfer the money out of the customer's account and      into the merchant's account.  I don't see how the bank can not know the      identity of the customer.
     This is why digital cash can be anonymous - because once the bank      (blindly) signs the cash tokens, these tokens ARE money.  They are not      pointers (in the case of cheques) to customers' bank accounts.
     However, if Alice (the customer) contacts her bank and requests a      cheque be made out to Bob (the vendor) for, say, $12.50 then the bank      can withdraw $12.50 from Alice's account and blindly sign a cheque for      $12.50 payable only to Bob.  Then the bank would not know Alice's      identity.  I don't think this is how CAFE works, since CAFE is      designed as an off-line smart card system.  Therefore, Alice cannot      requests bank cheques from her bank made payable to Bob when she walks      into Bob's store.
     Maybe your definition of a cheque is different than mine?

@_subject: redirect of newsgroups 
For those of us sitting behind a firewall that blocks out all of the      alt, rec, etc.. newsgroups...is there another way to access these      groups?  For example, redirecting the contents of alt.2600 to, say,      comp.2600 (because this firewall allows the comp.xxx groups through).       Or any other hacks around this inconvenience?

@_subject: Cybercash questions... 
Hello,
     Just a few questions about Cybercash...
     - How is the consumer's credit card # stored on his hard drive?       Encrypted with the bank's public key? Or does the consumer have a      private key?
     - How does the merchant know where to ship the goods?  Is the merchant      required to ship the goods to the billing address on the cardholder's      credit card account?  If so, does the bank provide the merchant with      this info?  How is it encrypted?  Or does the customer indicate to the      merchant where to ship the goods?  Also, what infor does the merhcant      send to Cybercash, and how is it encrypted?
     The fraud possibility I see is that Bob could steal Alice's encrypted      credit card number (by sniffing when she buys something at Charlie's      Internet shop).  Then, without decrypting it, he could use it (still      encrypted) at Don's Internet shop, and ask Don to ship the goods to      Bob's address.  Since Don will not decrypt Alice's card number he will      not know that it is not Bob's card.  Cybercash will validate Alice's      card, but will not know that it is really Bob who is the customer.       Don will ship the goods to Bob, and Alice will get a fraudulent charge      on her bill.
     Am I missing something?

@_subject: Cybercash security 
What are the major security risks of the Cybercash system?       I can't really find any, other than someone cracking the consumer's      Cybercash client s/w password and using the victim's account to order      something, or someone cracking RSA!.  The following features seem to      mitigate other risks...
     - The merchant never sees the credit card number
     - The Cybercash server does not store any credit card numbers (only      temporarily while it is waiting for an authorizatino for a specific      card purchase)
     - The consumer's credit card number is stored on his hard disk      encrypted w/DES
     - The consumer sends his credit card number across the Internet      encrypted w/DES and signed w/ 768-bit RSA

Re: the "trick" below... an even more effective search is the      following...
          etc%2Fpasswd&r=&d0=&d1=&Submit.x=51&Submit.y=14
     which searches all URLs that contain etc/passwd      See for yourself!

     Everyone,
     A friend of mine showed me a nasty little "trick" over the weekend. He      went to a Web Search server ( and      did a search on the following keywords -
             root: 0:0 sync: bin: daemon:
     You get the idea. He copied out several encrypted root passwords from      passwd files, launched CrackerJack and a 1/2 MB word file and had a      root password in under 30 minutes. All without accessing the site's      server, just the index on a web search server!
     Well, the first thing I did was check my site and it's ok. The second      thing I did was check my ISP for my home account, and it's okay. But      by trying various combinations of common accounts on web searches,      dozens of passwd files were found.
     It seems that a large number of locations who use httpd and ftpd on      the same server often copy the regular passwd file to ftp/etc or      ftp-users/etc for ftp user access. A few sites have left the root      password in the file, and many contain user accounts' passwords. The      problems I see here are as follows:
     1. You can get the passwd file in some cases by simply pointing your      URL to  or       Not good. Anon ftp can't get      it but a web browser can. Many passwd files are shadowed but you can      see some legit account names. Yes, I realize that this may be a dummy      file but hey, not always the case.
     2. Some sites do not have the passwd file world readable, but the      entire passwd file stills exists indexed on the web search server. I      don't know about you, but I don't think I'd want my passwd file      indexed and searchable on a world accessible web server.
     3. A ton of etc/group files turned up as well.
     The guy that showed me this found it funny, but I find it disturbing.      Are there that many sites that are that poorly configured?

@_subject: E-cash coin questions (Mark Twain / Digicash) 
1.  How many different coins (serial numbers) can the current Mark      Twain/Digicash protocol support?
     2. Does Mark Twain bank maintain 2 lists: 1 of all the ecash serial      numbers for all coins ever produced, and 1 of all the ecash serial      numbers for all coins that have been spent before?  Or just 1 list of      the spent coins (assuming that any coin that is signed w/MT's private      key and does not appear on the "spent" list is still valid and is not      counterfeit)?
     3.  The Digicash scheme allows each coin to be used only once and then      destroyed.  How many coins will it take before all possible coins are      minted, used and destroyed thereby requiring banks to issue new coins      with "recycled" serial numbers?  Remember, each time a "transaction"      takes place, an existing coin is destroyed and a new coin is minted.      and a transaction can simply be Alice giving her friend Bob a dollar      (not necessarily using the ecash for a purchase)
     4.  What is the probability of guessing a valid serial number,      assuming there are 1 million, 1 billion or 1 trillion coins in      circulation?
     5.  Suppose you have a very large number of cash coins signed by the      same bank (say, Mark Twain) and you know the record layout of each      coin (easy enough since you can decrypt it with the bank's public      key), and for each coin the "bank name" field is the same (because      it's the same bank!) -- then, would it be possible to hack the RSA      encryption and recreate the bank's private key?
