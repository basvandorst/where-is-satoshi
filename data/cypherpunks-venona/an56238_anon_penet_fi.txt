Hi Cypherpunks !
I've got a few questions about the RSA encoding (if they're answered somewhere
in litterature, just give directions, thanks)
    If the public encryption key is e (the exponent) and n=p*q (the modulus),
    then the encryption scheme is:
    Number theory tells us that the reverse operation (taking the e-th root)
    can be performed, as long as we know p and q: we know how to compute d
    such that for any plain<n, (plain^e)^d=plain.
    Now my questions are:
Here's an example that's quite worrying (maybe because I chose p and q
to be random primes, and they have bad properties):
e=17			# Exponent
p=967			# Prime p
q=1031			# Prime q
n=p*q=996977		# Public modulus
d=(1/e) mod f=234113	# A possible value of d given by number theory
Here's the result of the exhaustive search for the answer to question No. 2:
cipher=(plain^e) mod n
decipher=(cipher^d) mod n
The possible values for d (138 of them) are:
3393 10603 17813 25023 32233 39443 46653 53863 61073 68283 75493 82703 89913

969533 976743 983953 991163
That makes a probability of 0.013%
Looks to me like it's a LOT. Maybe I'm wrong.

Was that laudable or laughable ?
In my example, p and q a primes.
Which means:
I'm willing to believe you. Any general formulas giving the probability of
solutions for the d's ? Maybe I'm asking the wrong question. I'll ask again.
What are the properties of those d that unlock ALL messages encrypted by e
What are the properties of those d that unlock a GIVEN message encrypted by e

That was the answer I was lookin for. Any more maths available ? (formulas!,
formulas!) My paranoia hates the ``I believe'' part.
I did a brute force search too in my first example. However, this is the
story of the snake biting its tail:if you choose p and q with the ``nice''
properties you describe, you then restrict yourself to a subset of all
possible values of p and q, thus shrinking the key space search for the
possible attacker.
So, to completely answer the question, you need to figure out the
distribution of prime number couples (p,q) that verify:
This way you'll be able to know how much you're shrinking key space.

That reminds me of my first reaction to CypherPunks: why would the government
spend thousands of $$$ of supercomputer time & mathematician brains to see
your miserable piece of information, when all they have to do is lock you up
at the back of a countryside garage,  beat the shit out of you, inject
various chemicals into your blood until you spit out your secret key ?
That was a bit harsh, but, going back to the essentials, a crypto system
is as weak as its weakest link, isn'it ? Now that we've got them pgp, RSA and
IDEA and whatnot, fine, we've built a 20 inches thick steel chain around our
little secrets.
Except that this marvelous piece of technology is held together with a hair
strand: your brain.
Where you key is kept, and where everybody assumes it's safe.
Isn't time we take a look at another kind of cryptographic attack, the
ancestor of which bore the delicate name of penthotal ?
Nobody ever speaks of them chemicals that make you talk. But they exist,
and as well as cryptography techniques developed fast recently, trust the
government, those chemicals must have made a few advances.
Like, for example making you tell what you don't want to and then make you
forget about anybody asking.
Or maybe I watch too many serials.
Does anybody have informations about state of the art tell-us-you-story-pills ?

So, it looks like cryptography boils down to making a lot of noise on the
_everything_ channel, to prevent the state from listening to it, but
that the case of an individual under suspicion is hopeless.
How terrible!
That almost scares you into being honest and paying your taxes and
everything again.
All of you cypherpunks who were hoping to hide your little secrets with
pgp, just forget about it: what cryptography is all about is to make statistics
look bland.
But I *am* paranoid, and proudly so, since the age of two. And you would
be too if you were into the business of getting cryptography down into the
real world instead of toying with theoretical ideas in front of a computer

Phil Karn:
Phil, if you think cryptography as a purely defensive thing, you are
deeply mistaken. Cryptography implies anonymous mail, which in turn implies
the ability to do a lot of harm, through calomny, for example.
Dont be mistaken: cryptography can be an *offensive* weapon.
I think there's a place called talk.politics.guns somewhere.
There's more than _some_ people on this list that believe in self-defense
through guns.
