I'm aware of the three main disk encryption programs SFS, SECDRV, and
SECDEV, but I need to find a solution that works with Windows 95 32bit
or Windows NT 4.0.
I'm currently using SFS 1.17 and Secure Drive under Win-95, but am
unable to continue to work in dos compatability mode due to severe
performance hits.  I am open to commercial products that have passed
peer review, but know of none.
If anyone could suggest a solution (outside of switching OS's), I
would be *most* gratefull.
Please respond to the list, as I am a subscriber under another
Tried secdev? Edgar Swank (author of secdrv) recently posted
that secdev (note, not secdrv) does, in fact, uses 32 bit disk access with win95. Win95 reports that the secure device is in compatibility mode, but the host disk (and therefore the secure volume file) is being accessed in 32 bit (disk) mode. Not sure what issues there are with '32 bit FILE access' mode here. Sounds worth a try though. Please post the results if you try this.

    I have actually had Secure File System, Secure Drive, and Secure Device
    all installed with mounted volumes at the same time under Win95.  However,
    32bit file access is not the problem.  When you load a TSR in Win95, the
    operating system forces you into 16bit DOS compatability mode.  I'm not a
    kernal guru so I can't explain all the specifics, but it basically makes
    95 act as Win-3.11 and looses multithreading (as it were) and creates
    serious memory paging problems if you have >32mb installed.
You've got this all wrong. Only certain types of TSRs cause this. I'll leave it to an expert and just quote the author of secdrv:
    Thanks for the reply though .. and if you need assitance with getting
    SECDEV working under 95, just drop me a note.
Thanks for the offer ...     Drifter

I've checked the filtering out already ... it's pretty extensive. Far, far
more than Singapore's 'hundred' or so pages. The granularity is such that
things like  may be passed, while a link from
page to a subpage may be blocked. I guess they can afford to do
this with so few users and little traffic. Never thought I'd be real
interested in how Net Nanny worked ... but I am now.
I'd be happy to hear from anyone with good ideas (or (accessible) pointers)
about how to minimize the effects of this stupidity ... :-(

Hopefully stillborn. I use these services regularly and have never bothered to use the # or *

While I'm on the soapbox, a 'hash' is NOT a 'hatch' as well ... but that's
a losing battle.

What's the reason behind the policy direction against the use of personal web proxies running in a (paid for) shell account? Seems like less risk than you already accept anyway. Something I've missed?

It seems this was just stated on the list for advertizing purposes.
