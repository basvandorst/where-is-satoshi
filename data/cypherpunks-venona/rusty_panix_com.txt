Hi.  Can anyone answer a question about MacPGP?
My MaccPGP 2.2 seems to have developed a curious problem.
I'm using it on a Mac Classic with system software 6.07.
Both yesterday and today, I received a message from a friend,
encrypted with my public key. When I downloaded this message from my Unix account to my Mac, it
appeared on my screen as an MS Word icon.  (MS Word is the word processing
program I use.)
I launched MacPGP, and selected "Open/Decrypt" from the file menu, and up came the box with the list of files to choose from. I chose the just-downloaded message, and then, in the PGP message area, PGP gave me the following message:
But the key ID number listed **is** in fact MY valid, working key ID !!
Would anyone have any suggestions about why this is happening?
Thanks, enormously, in advance.
