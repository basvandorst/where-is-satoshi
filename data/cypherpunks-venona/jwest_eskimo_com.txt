            Internet Hoaxes: PKZ300, Irina, Good Times, Deeyenda, Ghost
November 20, 1996 15:00 GMT                                       Number H-05
PROBLEM:       This bulletin addresses the following hoaxes and
erroneous                warnings: PKZ300 Warning, Irina, Good Times, Deeyenda,
and                Ghost.exe
PLATFORM:      All, via e-mail
DAMAGE:        Time lost reading and responding to the messages
SOLUTION:      Pass unvalidated warnings only to your computer security                department or incident response team. See below on how to                recognize validated and unvalidated warnings and hoaxes.
VULNERABILITY  New hoaxes and warnings have appeared on the Internet and
old ASSESSMENT:    hoaxes are still being cirulated.
Good Times Virus Hoax
The "Good Times" virus warnings are a hoax. There is no virus by that
name in existence today. These warnings have been circulating the Internet for
years. The user community must become aware that it is unlikely that a virus
can be constructed to behave in the manner ascribed in the "Good Times" virus warning. For more information related to this urban legend, reference
CIAC Notes 95-09.

Good folks who already have too much to read:
I encourage that everyone who gets spam like that which follows forward the original message BACK TO THE SENDER (several times) demanding to know "what the hell does this have to do with cryptology, spammer ??" attached to the * end * of their quoted text.  Hopefully, the response that they receive will be "overwhelming" :)
If (s)he has to search through every message looking for "good replies," then they may be less inclined to solicit for such a voluminous response in the future.

The idea of distributing tokens by clever and complicated schemes seems interesting as a thought-experiment, but I wouldn't want to have to study the fine art of "cypherpunk posting technique" in order to insert my rare comments into a discussion thread.  Charging posting fees is also interesting, but as already discussed, has many weaknesses.
An easy solution would be to grant unlimited posting rights to anyone with more than one month's membership in the list.  This idea could be called "the endorsement scheme."
If anyone wishes to make an anonymous post, their submission would go into a "general pool" along with all the submissions from non-members and people who have subscribed for less than one month.  The "general pool" would be a webpage somewhere which has on the screen an "Approve" button which would bring up a "Username/Passowrd" box.
Anyone with more than three months membership in the list could apporove messages from the general pool.  If the senior member (_any_ _one_ senior member) feels that a post in the general pool is worth sending on to the full list, then the message gets general distribution, date- and time-stamped:     "Determined by --your_name_here-- (not the author)     to be of possible interest to at least one member     of the list."  (no problem ... Vulis could still     approve his "Huge Cajones Remailer" and his     "Suck_My_Big_Juicy_Cock" postings, and none of us     will ever figure out where they're coming from)
Senior members would never be in any way reprimanded for any item that they forwarded, unless through some "call-for-votes" type of action their item-inclusion privileges were curtailed (that'll never happen).  No one can "disapprove" or otherwise block any message from forwarding to the list.
The principle to be followed for which items to approve would be "essentially everything."  The idea is to strive to not block postings, but to leave "herbal remedy" ads hanging unendorsed.  Maybe the unendorsed posts could expire if unendorsed after 72 hours -- of course, the item would be immediately removed from the general pool when it received an endorsement and went to the list.
We have to be careful to not cause any legal liability to fall onto an endorser for approving an item (eg, source-code) which is later determined to be, eg, an ITAR violation, a copyright violation, etc.  The endorsement must have an effective disclaimer.
