I don't get it. Why is this bond not saleable like any other? What "privately-produced currencies" are a hedge against inflation? If this bond is saleable like any other, why is the money unavailable? What means "greater spendability?" Is this assumed to be yet another government plot because it competes with other offerings and reduces the cost of borrowing?

Get it straight Sandy Sandfort. I'm not in your home. I am in my home and I
will observe my priorities, not your's.
If Dr. Vulis was pushing the envelope in list-abuse as a multi-stage social
experiment, Sandy Sandfort has surpassed him by far. In part I refer to a
Sandy Sandfort reply to a criticism made by Paul Bradley. The reply was
made public two hours before the criticism was. This is not moderation. It
is manipulation and interference. Since I have a low tolerance for
self-serving pedantry, I never would have noticed the criticism if it had
not been preceded by the reply.
In the reply, Sandy Sandfort employs the name-calling "sophist" and
"hypocrite." Also in the reply is the Freudian slip or obscene proposition:
Shouldn't this have gone to cypherpunks-flames?
One might wonder just what the rules of proper decorum are.

Shame on Steve Schear for passing off this narcissistic gay whitebread shit as having been written by the renowned Robert Bork. No real person could be so transparently self-promoting and irrelevant as the obviously humorous author was.

@_subject: Palm III proves a hi-tech helper for car thieves 
Taken from
A 3Com Palm III and software that lets the handheld control TVs and VCRs
through its infrared port are all you need to nick a car these days, it seems.
Danish IT journalist Lars Sorensen made the discovery when testing the
sofwtare's legitimate uses. The software samples a TV's remote control
signals so it can replicate them -- Sorensen wondered if it would do the
same with a car's infrared lock and found that it would.
Here in the UK, estimates from the Motor Insurance Repair Research Centre,
quoted in New Scientist magazine, suggest that three million of the 22
million cars on the road are vulnerable to Palm-toting thieves.
Interestingly, older cars that are more at risk than newer models. Most
modern vehicles contain locking systems that change the locking code every
time the key is used from sequences of 10 to the power 64 (a one with 64
zeros after it) making it virtually impossible to predict the code at any
given instance.
That said, Sorensen was able to enter a 1998 model, so no one can be sure
they are safe.
