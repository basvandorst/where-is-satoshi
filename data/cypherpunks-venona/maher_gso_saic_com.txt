@_subject: Group ratings server (was Re: noise levels) 
the database in a very simple ascii file (internally it's a hash table).
program, so for me cypherpunks is seperated into cps (signal, rated 6-9)
cpu (unknown, rated 4-6 or no rating) and cpn (noise, rated 0-4).
that ratings from people you generally agreed with would be given greater
weight.  I don't know if they based this on comparing your ratings over a long list of messages, or simply looking up the average rating you gave their posts.
you listed, if you're really interested in experimenting with this.
