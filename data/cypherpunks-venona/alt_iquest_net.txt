Government does indeed "order society."  However, "order" does not
equat to liberty, luxury, or to individual freedom.
If strong government resulted in liberty and freedom, then the
most intrusive, all-encompassing governments would result in its citizens having the most liberty.  Is this the case?  I would
look at the (former) Soviet Union, Iran, Cuba, East Germany, etc., for your answer.
Individual liberties do not necessarily result in an "orderly
society."  In fact, an imposed "order" on society, by definition,
must result in limited liberties.
Apply this to anonymous remailers, and encrypted personal mail, and you can easily see how the government imposing "order" would
result in the end of those activities.

'Tis better to err on the side of liberty.
To suggest otherwise would indicate that the origin and true meaning of "rights" or "liberty" is not understood.  You can NOT restrict someone's rights simply because they MIGHT harm another (prior restraint).  If they do cause actual harm to someone, they should be brought to justice.  To place restrictions on someone based on the possibility that may may cause harm introduces restrictions based solely on the authorities' opinions (political philosophy, religion, race, etc).
That that the shape of the future YOU seek?

I would prefer that PGP would not give out ANY info about addressees.  It would seem to me that it is quite a security breach to have PGP dutifully tell you to whom it is addressed.  *           Just your basic signature block                *

I don't enjoy it, and don't particularly care to hear it - HOWEVER, I don't
see that they are harming anyone (I don't count "hurt feelings as "harm), any more than Malcolm X did when he called all white people "the devil," or when the militant Muslims do when they call all non-Muslims "heathens" or "the infidel" who should be killed.  (or any more than wingate does when he says all non-Jews should be done away with).  They are simply trying to "sell" their views by exposing their views.  If they want to think that, and if they want to say that, then that is their business.  I'm free to listen, or to avoid listening.  I can avoid their newsgroups, or turn off my radio.  That doesn't mean I have to like them, or
be nice to them - I am just as free to ridicule their views, and I won't care if I hurt their feelings.
If this sort of speech is regulated however, I will no longer have that choice.  If I ask the government to prevent them from speaking their views,
them only *I* am free to speak mine, so who is the victim?

There's still some mystery.
For instance, how does it differentiate between the magnetic
field of their strip, and the magnetic field of the strip on your
credit card, or the speaker on your cell phone?

I worked at a DoD contractor for a while, and there was a DoD-approved method of disposing of hard drives, which was expensive, laborious,
and rather silly.
We just had two witnesses watch as we smashed it to smithereens (technical term) with a sledge hammer, and then handed the parts over
to an approved disposal person (trash man).
It's JUST that easy.

You mean like buying a 30 round magazine, or putting a different
stock of your choice on a rifle, or owning an automatic weapon,
or mailing crypto out of the country, or hiring someone due to their
race, or not hiring someone because they are "fat?"

Which of our rights would you have us surrender so as to not play into the

You would have a hard time proving that cryptography has more, or
different "net benefits to society" than gun ownership does.
they are Statists say the same thing about crypto-advocates.  Talking about keeping secrets, and discussing which methods are uncrackable
by the government is not what a statist wants to hear - and neither
is talk about the real reason behind the 2nd Amendment.

I might disagree with the part about releasing it to the net, but I don't
with targeting a server which is claimed to be "secure."
Nobody would have been too upset or surprised if someone had built the
Titanic for the sole purpose of trying to sink it.  It only made waves (pun
because it was claimed to be "unsinkable" (secure), but sank anyway.
Maybe a good tactic would be to crack a "secure" server, and send the results
ONLY to the server operators, along with a description of machine-time involved.
Put out a public press release, describing the machine-time involved, how it was
possible due to weak crypto imposed by the government, and the possible
economic and commercial implications of said weak crypto.

That's not how they do it.  They will tell you that unless you cooperate,
you will
be charged for the "crime" you have been committing.  Where do you think
confidential informants come from?  They're just people who have been caught
or set up by the cops, who are trying to save their own ass.
