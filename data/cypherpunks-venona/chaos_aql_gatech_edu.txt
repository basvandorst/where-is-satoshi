In order to equalize, what may be construed as a growing disparity between
ripem and pgp availability (i.e. ripem binaries being kept online for ftp).
I have taken upon myself to start collecting binaries for PGP. If you would
be kind enough to email me if you would like to offer any binaries. I will
check against what I already have and get back to you for retrieval. Please
enclose your OS and sytem type (pretty much referring to UNIX here).

I understand your precaution and problem very well. I have had similar fears.
Recently, I was in similar situation recently. I wanted to exchange keys
with someone I have met only once. The situation as it arose actually ended
up working okay. We exchanged keys after encrypting them with the normal
encryption option, with a password being someone at the place we meet.
Knowledge common to only a few select people. Then we started a talk session
at a prescribed time at the relevant addresses and tried to rely on information
specific dialogue to verify one's person as the one in question. Without
physically being there this seems like at least a little extra security.
As to the broader question you are really asking on verification I am unsure
on how it can be solved. Obviously my situation was unique that we had met
and could decide on an information basis, that would seemingly be hard to
duplicate, but this is not always available.

fnerd formulates:
If you look in this directory you will find pgp sigs for the files by the
uploading individuals. I do not have access to every type of computer, thus
I queried on cypherpunks approximately 5 weeks (I think) for binary submissions.
The unix versions have individual sigs as you can see, as to the dos, this is
the original shipping material, I have not looked inside since I rely on Unix
myself. The Mac version was picked up from soda.berkeley.edu, as I understand
it sigs are included within the compactor pro archive. The os2 version is
in the same boat as dos. As for the amiga version, I am at a loss I do not
have access to an amiga, but viewing the archive a signature is apparently not
attached. I will try to find out who I received the file from as I currently
do not remember. I would like everyones opinion though. I thought that offering
binaries from sources I considered secure was a good idea. I understand the
inherent danger in not compiling the source yourself, but.... not everyone
knows how to compile. What is the list's opinion. Is this a bad idea? Improper?

_Big Brother's encryption_
   In his Peer to Peer essay on the Clipper data encryption chip (see "Clipper
chip won't clip your wings, it will just protect the unprotected," June 21,
page 55), A. Padgett Peterson contends that "the government has more to lose
by being exposed to world ridicule from a trapdoor or backdoor than it can hope to gain." My direct experience with the National Security Agency indicates
   At the 1981 fall Comdex, Epic computer Corp. unveiled Kryptyk, the only
commerical E-mail crypto package for CP/M computers. My software team and I had
implemented the first RSA public key cryptosystem for microprocessors. Our booth was swamped with managers from the Fortune 500 and many international
   Our ecstasy was still strong when a week later we were visited by the NSA.
I proudly explained that we could not inject a trapdoor function -- that
cracking the algorithm was computationally infeasible, even with the then-
recent advances of prime number theory in France.
   Within a month we received a letter from the Bureau of Tobacco and Firearms
the proclaimed our product was "strategic munition" and could not be sold
either to multinational companies nor outside the continental United States --
a heavy penalty for not allowing a trapdoor. And we should believe that NIST
and NSA did not boobytrap the Clipper chip?
   I agree with Mr. Peterson that "security by obscurity just does not work."
Remember Watergate? Teh Warren Commission's magic-bullet findings? But as long
as governments are the only people who can depend on having secrets, they
will always view their citizenry as fools to be manipulated. And when governments sanction data security, rest assured they can freely "E-avesdrop"

Thought this might be of interest to us cypherpunks and the EFF, in case you have not heard. Excerpted from the most recent issue of ALAWON.
                 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ISSUES NEW FOIA POLICY
On October 4, President Clinton and Attorney General Reno rescinded a 1981
rule which encouraged federal agencies to withhold information requested
under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) whenever there was "a
substantial legal basis" for doing so.  In its place, agencies are directed
to apply a "presumption of disclosure."  A memorandum from President
Clinton urged agencies to take a fresh look at their administration of the
FOIA, to reduce backlogs of requests, and to enhance public access to
information.  (See below for the full text of the memorandum.)
In a memorandum sent to heads of departments and agencies, Attorney General
Reno stated that
     ...we must ensure that the principle of openness in government is
     applied in each and every disclosure and nondisclosure decision that
     is required under the Act....It shall be the policy of the Department
     of Justice to defend the assertion of a FOIA exemption only in those
     cases where the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would be
     harmful to an interest protected by that exemption.  Where an item of
     information might technically or arguably fall within an exemption, it
     ought not to be withheld from a FOIA requester unless it need be.
At a Department of Justice briefing, Associate Attorney General Webster
Hubbell acknowledged that there was a huge backlog of FOIA requests, and
said the Department of Justice wanted to hear of the problems requestors
were having.  He said that the Department would review all pending FOIA
lawsuits, but would not provide additional funding to fill FOIA requests.
When asked about FOIA access to electronic records, John Podesta, White
House Staff Secretary, replied that agencies would work with users to get
information to them in a usable way.  He added that OMB, the White House,
and the Department of Justice were all committed to making information
One person at the briefing asked about privacy issues, and noted that the
FBI would not search for records on an individual because of concerns about
privacy.  Hubbell replied that the FBI should ask the individual first, but
that the new FOIA regulations presumed disclosure.  He added that the
Department of Justice would discuss the matter with the FBI director.

MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES
SUBJECT:  The Freedom of Information Act
I am writing to call your attention to a subject that is of great
importance to the American public and to all Federal departments and
agencies -- the administration of the Freedom of Information Act, as
amended (the "Act").  The Act is a vital part of the participatory system
of government.  I am committed to enhancing its effectiveness in my
For more than a quarter century now, the Freedom of Information Act has
played a unique role in strengthening our democratic form of government.
The statute was enacted based upon the fundamental principle that an
informed citizenry is essential to the democratic process and that the more
the American people know about their government the better they will be
governed.  Openness in government is essential to accountability and the
Act has become an integral part of that process.
The Freedom of Information Act, moreover, has been one of the primary means
by which members of the public inform themselves about their government.
As Vice President Gore made clear in the National Performance Review, the
American people are the Federal Government's customers.  Federal
departments and agencies should handle requests for information in a
customer-friendly manner.  The use of the Act by ordinary citizens is not
complicated, nor should it be.  The existence of unnecessary bureaucratic
hurdles has no place in its implementation.
I therefore call upon all Federal departments and agencies to renew their
commitment to the Freedom of Information Act, to its underlying principles
of government openness, and to its sound administration.  This is an
appropriate time for all agencies to take a fresh look at their
administration of the Act, to reduce backlogs of Freedom of Information Act
requests, and to conform agency practice to the new litigation guidance
issued by the Attorney General, which is attached.
Further, I remind agencies that our commitment to openness requires more
than merely responding to requests from the public.  Each agency has a
responsibility to distribute information on its own initiative, and to
enhance public access through the use of electronic information systems.
Taking these steps will ensure compliance with both the letter and the
spirit of the Act.
