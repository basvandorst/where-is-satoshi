What is the risk of publishing your dynamic IP address to a web page while you are on line?  How vulnerable is someone just connected to the internet, w/o any server running? What attacks are feasable? --Internaut

Even greater than denial of service I believe that there are other threats.  Like I just found this file on c2.org (I believe it was) on using an IP address to explore somebody's hard drive under certain conditions.  EXPORTING YOUR ENTIRE FILESYSTEM                                                 Samba      When a Windows for Workgroups or Windows 95 machine shares any folder, bugs in Microsoft's SMB
     implementation over all network protocols allow access to the whole drive, with whatever permissions the sharename
     was given. These resources are advertised on a browse list that is made available to anyone on the local network by
     default, and to anyone on the Internet who knows the machine's IP address. Any user sharing any folder over TCP/IP
     without a password is opening the whole disk to the whole Internet (for those that can locate the machine) and those
     with a password should be aware that Windows has no protection against brute force attacks. SMBCLIENT, an
     ftp-style browser for any UNIX, plus a complete file system for Linux and a few UNIX versions, are available from the
     Samba web site. Please note that Samba's exploitation of this fundamental bug in Microsoft file sharing was
     unintentional, and was immediately reported to Microsoft. It could have happened with any client over any protocol.      An alleged fix for Windows for Workgroups was quietly released in early October, and Microsoft publicly announced a
     fix for Win95 on October 20th. It has not been rigorously tested, but it appears to fix the problem. The fix for Windows
     for Workgroups might not be a complete fix, but rather a patch for one way to exploit the problem. (The release version
     of Win95 prevented cd .. below the shared folder "root," but not cd ../) The patches and Microsoft press releases
     (which have been corrected at least twice, but which still erroneously identify Samba as shareware, neglect to credit the
     people who notified Microsoft of the problem, and neglect to mention that this is a fundamental bug in Windows, not a
     problem specific to TCP/IP or Samba) are available on Microsoft's Windows 95 Updates Page. The patch only works
     on the US/English version of Windows 95; at this writing, all non-English versions of Windows 95 are still vulnerable. I just have this gut feeling that sitting out here without any protection somebody could write something that could hook into a program, or even worse the system (i.e. Explorer).   Perhaps my fears are totally unfounded (besides above problem w/ samba), but I have not heard anyone say that one *is* secure.  -- Internaut

    greed and the internet
        our network provider (MCI) has been gradually burying our T1     trunk and the effective feed has been reduced to 1200 baud from     1.56 Megabaud; that, and add 20 seconds to 5+ minutes of packet     hold, and it is now worthless. they claim they will have increased
    capacity, but there are no pressing big money commercial interests
    on this feeder --so when?          Problem is not just here --everywhere; the greedy commercial     bastards have oversold their network space intentionally as they     are bucking for per packet and timed usage charges which are     currently prohibited by the FCC and the state PUCs. The FCC is the     key since other than the local network, which is burdened with the     costs of the trunk, everything is regulated by the FCC which is     trying to totally eliminate the state PUCs in the 105th Congress,         Newt's mouth not withstanding.
        The FCC agreed to review the matter, capitulating to     big greed interests, which will make the Internet a rich man's     toy. $19.95/month plus access charges will increase to thousands     of dollars per month; slow networks make toast of the free hours     and overtime kills.  Without the creative input of the multitude,     there will be no content, so why have a net other than for     commercial purposes? suites the misinformation cabal just fine.
    come up again, and again, until it passes.
        The Internet will no no longer be the peoples net, and the     commercial greedies are establishing a faster, more secure     network with controlled access points; leaving the common man's     access in the mud, still paying the exorbitant rates on a pay     before play basis.  That, and it gives control of information to     the government --which, as we all know. is 'heavenly white'     -above sin.
        Universities are being bought off with the 'Internet II'     proposal which provides super trunks of over 600 Megabaud     capacity, a 400 times improvement. All of this feeds into five     stategically placed super-hubs where Uncle's shadow government can     monitor everything.
        The Internet was supposed to be our freedom: freedom of     information and government in the sunshine, but government is     proving it is still bigger, faster, and badder by using draconian     rules of illegal regulatory agencies. agencies which are usurping     rights limited to the legislative branch.

>>shudder<<
    No!. A clear case of the cure being worse than the disease...
I was just kidding.  We do have to take on risks, like people wearing clothes, carring packages, ect.  As Igor Chudov @ home wrote recently in the Newt's phone calls thread:
We have two seemingly conflicting desires: the desire for security and the desire for privacy.  I do not call being searched "privacy" yet I do not call not being searched "security".  We need to find creative resolutions to these conflicts.
Of course, it is debatable if there is even an expectation of privacy on an airplane.  I don't mind terrably being searched in an airport by security because I don't expect the privacy.  I expect security.  I don't want to die.  If I have things I don't want them to see, there are other ways to get it there. I would worry if they cataloged what I had in a database and sold it to others.
 The service is just that -a service.  It is not a right.  We can travel other ways, too.

@_subject: Passphrase generation 
I am wanting to learn how to generate a passphrase that is at least as strong as the IDEA algorithm.  I have looked several other places on the web for an answer to this, but they all had different things to say that didn't add up (no pun intended :).
The IDEA algorithm it seems is 2^128 =  3.402823669209e+38 = 16 bytes The charactor count seems kinda small (I am presuming the 16 charactors are truely random).
Indeed, 128(ASCII charactor set)^16 =  5.192296858535e+33.
Is my thinking right here?
Is it better to do this- 94(printable ASCII set)^20 =  2.901062411315e+39, yielding 20 charactors?
Also, if you come up with a phrase and put enough (perhaps 5 or 6) ASCII nonsense in there for it not to be in any crack dictionaries, how random is that?  Is it only as random as the extra charactors you put in?  How would you calculate that?
Also, how many charactors do you have to add of a set to add its permulations (i.e. Does gibber&sh add all ASCII symbols to the equation)?
Thanks, Internaut

Chech out the cannonical passphrase FAQ:
This one has some quick reminders of what to do and not to do
Bottom line, totally random ASCII will have lots of bits per
character, but english has about 1.2 bits per character. Misspellings
can add to that, depending on the extent of mutillation . Combining
certain words can make your passphrase weaker (such as "To be or not
to be," "This is my passphrase," etc.).
