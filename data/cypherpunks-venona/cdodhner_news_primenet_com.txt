I'm sure most of you have seen some of the cheap (relatively speaking) 'phone scramblers' and such sold in local "spy shops" and catalogs. I know as well as most of you that these (almost always analog) scrambler systems even with thier "10,000 code frequencies!" and such are totaly insecure against an attacker with modern resources, but I was wondering if any of these techniques would be good enough to use for real-time applications where the transmitted data is only valuable for 6 hours or less. Such a system would be usefull if you only need security 'right now' and didn't care who knew after a certain (short) timeframe. Comments, advice and product reviews are all welcome from anyone with knowledge or experience in the area.
Happy Hunting, -Chris.
