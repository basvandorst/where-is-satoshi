nCognito is back up and running, with a new address and new keys, etc etc. I apologize for any inconvenience this may (have) cause(d).
The new address is:   ncognito
The NEW pgp key is: -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6.2
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
And the new mix key is:
ncognito ncognito 94e30b262408ac816144405faa62d623 2.0.2
-----Begin Mix Key-----
-----End Mix Key-----
Lot's of thank-you's to everyone that helped with getting the mailer back up and running so quickly.
...Oh, and next time someone remind me to keep my keys so we can avoid all this work in the future.
