Dunno, But you might get a kick out this from The Chicago Reader that published a list of the "bomb threats" made at O'Hare International airport a few weeks back.
7/18:  "I have nothing other than the bomb I am going to put on the plane."
7/18:  "I have a bomb that's going to go off in 30 seconds."
7/18:  "You mean the bomb I have in my bag?"
7/19:  "I don't have an ID, but I have a bomb."
7/21:  "There's a bomb in the bag in my hand."
7/23:  "I don't have a bomb in the bag."
7/23:  "I got a bomb in my bag to kill everyone here."
7/24:  "Well no, I left my pipe bomb at home."
7/25:  "The one that looks like [there's] a bomb in it."
7/26:  "I have a bomb in my bag.  Boom."
7/27:  "Where should I put the bomb?"
7/27:  "No, nothing but a bomb."
7/31:  "Are you checking for bombs?  I've got a bomb in my bag."
7/31:  "I have some explosives to transport."
8/1:  "It's not as if we were Swedish and here to blow up the airport."
8/2:  Offender:  "It's a bomb in the bag."  Witness:  "That's not funny."
Offender:  "I'm not playing."
8/3  "I have a bomb."

@_subject: The Three Horsemen??? 
It seems most everywhere I turn, either on the Internet or on television there is some reference to the Four Horseman of the Infocalypse, -Terrorists, Pedophiles, Drug Dealers and Money
Launderers, But no real hard evidence.
But since the story broke in the Observer I have been trying to remember where I heard of Toby Tyler before, I belive it was on a television show on the Discovery Channel that Tim May was in, and recently I found this about Mr. Tyler in the Clari. newsgroups reporting on the child sex trade.
 One professional cybercop is Toby Tyler, who surfs the Net from his computer terminal in the San Bernadino (Calif.) County Sheriff's Department. He searches for scams, sources of child porn, and deceptions designed to entrap children. Five investigators in his department are busy full-time investigating child sexual exploitation - much of it flowing from pedophiles trying to set up meetings with children by computer.
 The Internet is a ``two-edged sword'' for child pornographers,  Deputy Tyler says. On the one hand, he says, it seems to have damaged the profitability of pornographers who sell their wares via dial-up computer ``bulletin board.'' There is so much free stuff on the Internet - why would anyone pay? Wouldn't the Observer article about anon.penet.fi transmitting
75 to 90% of the child porn on the Internet lead you to belive
that since it has been shut down that all Internet child porn
will pretty much dry up?
I Wonder if its now the Three Horsemen of the Infocalypse? William Knowles

Being that I totally agree that you get what you pay for in banking,
and have had the opportunity of using a small private bank for business some time ago.  What would be your list of best offshore
banks to do business with, Keeping in mind the ease of opening an
account but still getting top notch service?  Bank of Ireland???

@_subject: PCS Encryption? 
In light of recent events with the Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich having his cellular phone call recorded and given to the Democrats I went out and bought a Primeco digital phone
which uses CDMA technology to scramble the calls and makes
passive listening next to impossible.  (Primeco is a PCS phone)
I have been having one helluva a time trying to find more
information on the encryption used with Primeco, I have spoken to customer service twice & the local rep told me that
the the Chicago FBI asked Primeco to shut off a phone this
week because they can't listen in on what is been said,
To which the the Primceco guys reply, If the feds can't listen
in then I shouldn't be worried.
This only tells me that the Chicago FBI doesn't have the technology in town for now to listen in.  Excuse me if this posting is a little off topic, But I have
nearly looked everywhere on the WWW to no avail.
Thanks in advance!
