This is a shining example of the Conservation of Tyranny.  The former
Soviet Union is becoming more free (with admittedly a few bumps in the
road), so the US is becoming less so (with a few bumps such as the
temporary defeat of Clipper).
Sadly, this is only partially tongue in cheek.

I like Federal Usurpation of Citizens Keys for Encrypted Discourse, myself.

[snip] [snip] Um, thats what I do on my Mac.  The smoothness of Internet Config+Newswatcher
+IceTEE+Eudora+Anarchie is beautiful to watch - I command-click a URL while
reading mail and the right app magically takes care of everything.
[begin annoyed complaints here]
If only MacPGP were so easy.  MacPGP is such a pain in the ass for me that
I'm 90% done configuring a Linux box so I can sign/encrypt without hassle.
There are other planned uses for valkyrie, of course, but the triggering
factor is encryption.  I'd much rather keep PGP and my keys on my Duo that
I take everywhere, but that'd be too easy.
First I had troubles with it crashing my machine, then it wouldn't extract keys,
then it would extract keys but my buddy with the dos machine couldn't import
them (and yes, I had it set to ascii armor them).  The litany goes on and on.
I suspect that it is RamDoubler that MacPGP hates, but am unwilling to give it
up - I *need* that extra 12MB for work.
I'm not a moron; I got it working well enough under DOS to have taught
several friends to use it, it just doesn't like my Mac.
Does anyone have any information on when 3.0 is going to be released?  I'd
rather fight with a buggy new version than a buggy old version that will be
superceded RSN.
I'm also interested from an OpenDoc standpoint - I just got the OpenDoc DR2 CD
and would really like to make a PGP aware OpenDoc container.  I have time to
code now, but won't after September.

I like this, myself.  It'd be nice to be able to have the picture of my
choosing instead of a digitized thumbprint...
