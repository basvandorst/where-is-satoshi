A remailer has one purpose: To spam. Just like any other tool,
a remailer, if it is available *_*will*_* be used at some point.
  Making sure there are lots of remailers around only serves to make
a lot of people very spammed. This is a **_**Bad Thing**_**.
  That's right. Since Hitler instituted gun control in Europe, the
human beings in Europe gas people en masse.
  In Europe, where ovens are a tradition, and part of the European way,
many people would not think twice before gassing someone. The result of
this is that the number of people getting killed by ovens is enourmous,
be they little Jews, old Jews, or Jew lovers.
  Not many Europeans complained when the American gun-loving people came
to visit and a lot of Nazis got shot.
  Wake up and smell the burning Jews, dude.

I can walk alone and armed anywhere I damn please, without fearing
for my life.
  Without fascist gun control measures in place, Canada had never had
a big problem with gun-related violence.
  The fact that the Canadian government has gone to such great lengths
to 'solve' a problem which does not exist, speaks volumes.
  This is precisely the reason that governments are pushing for stronger
and stronger gun control laws.
  The government has no interest in removing the source of crime. Crime-
-violent crime, in particular--is the government's best friend. By using
gun control to disarm *only* the law-abiding citizens, they put the safety of the citizens in the hands of their own LEA's. And by failing
provide safety for the law-abiding citizens, they force more and more
of them to break the law in order to protect themself.
