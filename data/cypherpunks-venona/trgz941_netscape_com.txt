BOOST YOUR WEB SITE'S TRAFFIC--GET LISTED ON YAHOO!
YAHOO! REJECTS 90% OF ALL SUBMITTED WEB SITES--BE IN THE 10%
PROBLEM: In case you didn't know, Yahoo!'s staff rejects over 90% of the submissions they receive. SOLUTION: Our R&D division has studied hundreds of sites--
both those that have been successfuly indexed and those that have been rejected.
SOLUTION: Based on our findings, we've helped hundreds of clients not only get their site into the Yahoo! index, but into a very prominent place within that index. The Yahoo! Project Team can do the same for you.
THE YAHOO! SITE SELECTION PROCESS--IN A NUTSHELL
"I can just submit my URL and be considered for a listing, right? It's easy, isn't it?"
No. It's not. Read on to learn why.
PROBLEM: Every site that gets accepted into the Yahoo! directory is scrutinized by a Yahoo! "editor." The first step in the submission process is to get an already overworked editor to look at your site.
SOLUTION: We have a carefully-researched technique to help your site's chances of being examined.
PROBLEM: Before submitting, your site *must* be prepared
for the Yahoo! editor's "10 minute lookover." In order
to grab that editor's attention--and get listed--you need
to understand what he or she will be examining to determine if your Web site gets a Yahoo! listing.  SOLUTION: Our R&D division has studied hundreds of Yahoo! rejection letters and learned why Yahoo! editors commonly reject sites. In short, we can *tell* you FOR THE SERIOUS SITE OWNER--THE CUSTOMIZED YAHOO! EVALUATION
We also offer a "Customized Evaluation" service where we'll examine your site like a Yahoo! editor will--and tell you, step-by-step, each of the changes you'll need to make before submitting to Yahoo!.
The "Customized Evaluation" includes all of the information from the "Secrets to getting a top Yahoo! listing" report *plus*:
<> A customized evaluation of your competitors' sites and why       they are so important to consider before submitting
<> An evaluation of your site's technical specs. and       recommendations for improving them
<> An evaluation of your site's content and recommendations       for improving it
"Secrets to getting listed on Yahoo!" report -- $99
Customized Web site evaluation (incl. report) -- $249
