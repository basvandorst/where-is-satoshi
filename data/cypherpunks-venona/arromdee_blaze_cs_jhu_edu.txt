Black Unicorn:
Any individual has the right to decide what information to give out.  If that
means the individual has to judge someone else's purposes, then so be it.  The
individual may even try to persuade others not to give out the information.
It only becomes a problem if he's trying to use force--to keep others who
_do_ want to reveal the information, from revealing it.  This is _the_
difference between the current situation, and real police state censorship;
censorship prevents someone from speaking who wants to speak; it doesn't
merely mean that the government itself won't speak to you.

Not unless person B is trying to force other people not to give out the
information.  Failure to release the information himself is not censorship;
it doesn't matter what his reasons for doing so are.

There is a difference between believing that something is wrong (a moral
stance), and believing that force should be used to stop it (a ban).  A
consistent position, for someone believing remailers are bad, would be that
they personally wouldn't run a remailer or tell other people how to
do so.  It would not require advocating bans on remailers.
And trying to _convince_ other people not to do something, without the
threat of force, is not _banning_.
