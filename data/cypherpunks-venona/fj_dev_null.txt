In celebration of the DES Challenge success, I am sending out copies
of a 1983 Time-Life picture of a naked boy and girl playing in a risque
position that indicates the boy could have his penis inserted in the
girl's rear.
  In celebration of the crack of weak financial cryptography that
leaves businesses vulnerable because of the U.S.'s ignorant and fascist
crypto policy, I am encrypting the file using a 4096-bit key produced
with an encryption package I downloaded off of a European ftp site.
  So, while some thief is using a computer to steal your life savings,
I will be sitting back drinking champagne and enjoying pictures of
naked children that Time-Life profited from by selling them to middle
class Americans in the 80's.
  I am sorry that I feel the need to encrypt the picture with strong
cryptography acquired from a foreign source, but I am just a normal
citizen and not a major corporation, so I would go to jail for sharing
this with you even though I am not profiting from it as they did.
