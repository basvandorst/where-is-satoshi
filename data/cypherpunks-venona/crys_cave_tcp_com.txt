Slight complaint:  The only available port of perl to DOS is 386 or
higher only, so will definately limit your effective use more than an
executeable or batch file.  As for a Mac Perl, a quick scan of my
Camel book doesn't turn up a mention of one.  I could have missed it.

The executeable in the file you refer to can also be ftp'd from
tandem.com, it's source site, in the directory /pub/perl. To quote
the README file for that directory:
Last updated: Saturday, February 1, 1992
Latest bcdos version of Perl: 1.4
This is a port of Perl 4.019 to MS-DOS using Borland C++ V3.0.  It will
NOT compile with versions of BC++ prior to 3.0.
The port is complete given the functionality of DOS versus UNIX.  Support
will be added in the future for ndbm() routines using GNU-ndbm (when I
get around to it !).
The port makes use of Borland's VROOM technology and pretty much *requires*
access to extended memory.  There is approx. 300+ Kbytes of memory available
          ^^^^^^^^
for Perl scripts.  The amount of memory available can be checked using
two user subroutines added via Larry Wall's usersub.c hook.
The port also makes use of xspawn() (available from Simtel or Wuarchive
if you look hard enough) and will swap itself to either extended memory
or disk when Perl invokes the system() call.  This leaves about 605 Kbytes
of memory available for DOS apps on my 386 machine running DOS 5.0.
I've run this port of Perl against all the test cases supplied in the
normal Perl release.  They all work except those that call perl again
(not enough memory !) or have specific UNIX dependencies (that dont work
on DOS - too bad !).
This version of Perl has been tested on both 286 and 386 machines with
and without extended memory.  If you find problems on a specific machine
I would like to hear about them but don't necessarily commit to fix them.
As per the Artistic and GNU licenses, you get what you paid for and your on your own !
There are three files herein:
Nota bene re extended memory;
This port attempts to reserve 128K bytes of extended memory for the
VROOM arena.  A 64K arena ran like a DOG so this is about the optimum size of memory versus speed.
Happy hacking !
Stuart G. Phillips N6TTO/G8HQA/DA4BM/OZ... (you get the idea)
I've not encountered a non 286/386/486 with extended memory, which
this file says it requires.  Plus there is no testing on machines
other than those.  I've attempted to run this on an antiquated
8088.  It simply executes and drops back to the command line
without action.  Much as I feel perl would be an easy and useful way
to code this up, I don't feel it's a tool with the broadest reach
at this time for DOS.  Sorry.

Second reason for compatibility that I was too sleep-depped to think
of this morning in my reply, is that do we really want to assume the
position that for the reasonable chunk of possible users out there
using 8088 or 8086 processors that we're going to tell them if they

Erm, only that this apparently appears to pretty much _require_ switching
mailreaders to MH.  A more transparent solution can be achieved with the
'procmail' package, available from any comp.sources.misc archive.  This
package allows rule-based filtering on message content, size, and other
factors, and can be installed workably with most mailreaders to my
knowledge, without requiring much effort.
