@_subject: Income Tax Newsletter - May 
The newsletter this month got so long that I decided to put it up on the web rather then send it out this way. It is an in-depth article on the history of the Federal Income Tax. For anyone with an interest in reducing taxation, it is worth a read.
Best Regards, Jon
Also, there may have been some REMOVE requests that I did not receive in April, if you are one of those, or, you would like to be removed at this time, just hit reply and send. You will be automatically placed in a permanent REMOVE file.
