: What level of security is achieved by the practice of "chaining"
: messages through various "anonymous remailers"?  To find out your "real" identity, those who want to find out need to
have cooperation of all remailer involved. If one link cannot/doesnot
cooperate the chain is broken and so your ID remains hidden.

My remailers keep no sendlogs, and they are out-side US jurisdiction. Only
anon has a database to match the allocated ID to an email
adress. remail & remailer do not keep logs at all. My remailers also support PGP and changing Subjects, you can send a PGPencrypted message to VoX and it will be decypted, if the recipiant has
a PGPpubKEY in my KEYring [with matching adress] mail send to him/her will
also be encrypted using that KEY.
If you want more info send a msg to HELP
But remember it is up to you to decide whether you trust the remail operator or not. Sending mail in a chain of remailers who support PGP
will give the following :
remailer 1 : recieves an ecnrypted message, the system decrypts and
             gives a R-R-To: remailer 2 + an "new" encrypted msg.
             Only remailer 1 could know the real ID of the sender
             but he doesnot know the contents of the remailed msg.
remailer 2 : receives an encrypted message from remailer 1, the system
             decrypts and gives a R-R-To: remailer 3 + an "new" encrpted
             message. Remailer 2 only could find out that the message came
             from remailer 1 the real ID an contents of the message is
             being kept secret for remailer 2.
remailer 3 : reciever an encrypted message from remailer 2, the system
             decrypts and gives an R-R-To: the recipiant and the decrypted
             message. Remailer 3 only could find out what the contents and
             the recipiant are, the originator will be kept hidden.
Note that the encrypted messages are "enveloped" in the previous encrypted
message. [The msg to rem 1 is encrypted and contains the encrypted mesg for rem 2,

:But how does one go about chaining through the remailers? I tried this :and the message got lost. If indeed you can, does it just involve using :more than one (anon-to) line in the header?
Note-1: [R-R-T: stands for Request-Remailing-To: ]
Note-2: [You is in this doc abraxas          substitute that adress for own if you want          to receive the test message yourself]
First you should test only one remailer:
you > remailer 1 > RRT- you
This is what you send:
    TO: remailer
    ::
    Request-Remailing-To: abraxas
    Test of remailer at jpunix.com
The above is simple unencrypted remailing. If you want to have an
encrypted chained remailing, you first have to "design" the chain.
    1] send to jpunix.com there RRT kaiwan.com
    2] at kaiwan.com RRT vox.hacktic.nl
    3] at vox.hacktic.nl RRT abraxas
First you make the 3rd stage:
    ::
    Request-Remailing-To: abraxas
    Test of PGP'ed remailing trough jpunix, kaiwan and vox.
The above is encrypted whit the PGPpubKEY of VoX.hacktic.nl and will
result in this:

_1  werewolf             ->  remail

First you make the _3rd message,      below means : only 1 blanc line

                  then the Anon-Send-To line

                  then the actual message.
---cut here-------------------
Anon-Send-To: werewolf
This is some anon mail from me :)
---end here-------------------
You encrypt the lines between the --- with the PGPpubKEY of soda:
Tommy the Tourist 512/5E6875 1994/04/25
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.3a
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
You then have an encrypted message that has to leave hacktic
in such a way that soda know it is encrypted, and it has to be send to hacktic in such a way that it knows it has to remail it
to soda.
so you put these tokens above it:
---cut here-------------------
X-Anon-To: remailer
Encrypted: PGP
---end here-------------------
The lines between --- you encrypt with the PGPpubKEY of vox.hacktic.nl
remail and anon
512/368B41 1994/04/29
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.3a
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
You get [if all goes well :)] another PGP encypted message,
You send this to hacktic:
---cut here-------------------
Encrypted: PGP
---end here-------------------
It should work that way .. FYI, you can also post to usenet from vox, [to approx 2800 newsgroups] you can use: X-Anon-To: alt.soccer.world-cup
        or : X-Anon-To: alt.soccer.world-cup

There are basicly two remailers at vox.hacktic.nl :
- -> a cypherpunx-style remailer with three adresses
        -) nobody
        -) remail
        -) remailer
- -> a anon mail back ID remailer
        -) anon
Sometimes you may find it conveniant to have te ability to receive
mail, but to remain anonymous for the sender. anon
gives you that ability.
Here is some info:
{step 1}
send some mail to ping to receive a pong and an account
ie. an0
{step 2}
send your first message to anon the commands for remailingare similair to the cypherpunx-remailers, the only differance will be the sender.
If you send mail to remail the name that will appear in the FROM: line is nobody If you send mail to anon the corresponding entry for the
adress that is sending the mail will be in the FROM: line, ie an0 so someone can contact you by sending mail to an0 This mail will not be anonymised, you -will- know the sender. If you - -as a sender- want to remain anonymous send the mail trough a remailer
or aquire a anon account at vox.hacktic.nl and send the mail using the
anon remailer.
{step 3}
make -absolutily positively- sure the header pasting tokens [::] are
the first thing you type, if you start with a blanc line, your remail
request -will- fail.
Hope this helps.

The "Hack-Tic Network Foundation" has decided to change its name,
into a more mainstream "XS4all Networking" [access for all]. This will include a change in domain name. The changes will be made during this weekend, this may cause some slight disturbances in the
remailing service. One is advised to do a test messages before an actual remailing request since no garantee for proper functioning during this change can be given.
The new domain name will be xs4all.nl, the hacktic.nl domain name will
be operational for another 6 months till february 1995.
The remailers affected are:
    usura -> usura
The adresses for the remailers at my UUCP node:
    nobody
    remail
  remailer
      anon
and the anon-ID's associated with them will be changed at a later date,
more information will be supplied as it becomes available in the following

@_subject: Remailer-list pinging frequency 
: 1. Encrypt the ping, so it looks like so much PGP traffic.
A good idea, if a c'punk remailer cannot decrypt a message it should be
considerd "down".
: 2. Pad it with a random amount of junk (but not _too_ much :-), so
: traffic analysis based on size will fail.
That would be the start of RemailerNet. :)
: 3. Chain it through other remailers. A good approach might be to
: choose two random remailers out of the "top five," and sandwich rebma
: between them. The drawback is that it penalizes rebma for their
: latency and failure rate, but this might be acceptable.
One question about your "suggested path", it looks like you thake the tree fastes remailers [if using kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu]. If the two remailers from Hal Finney are consecutive [ie. 1 and 2 fastes] a suggestion to mail from alumi to portal would IMHO be wrong, because for security reasons both remailers should be regarded the same, since they are operated by the same person.
