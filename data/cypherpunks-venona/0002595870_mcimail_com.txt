FRANCE PROPOSES KEY ENCRYPTION LAW
The French government has proposed a law that would mandate a key-recovery system for all encrypted electronic documents, a move that is opposed by the business community and the European Commission.  Earlier this month, the European Commission rejected the key-recovery approach to encryption, which some believe would make it easier for competitors to gain access to a company's business secrets.  "I do not say this is the best system," says the chief of France's Central Service for the Security of Information Systems.  "It is the least bad in trying to find a balance between national-security interests, economic interests and the protection of personal privacy."  (Wall Street Journal 20 Oct 97)

SECURE ENCRYPTION CHALLENGED BY INTERNET-LINKED COMPUTERS
CHICAGO, IL (October 22, 1997) In what could be called the largest
distributed-computing effort ever, tens of thousands of computers
linked across the Internet, under the leadership of distributed.net,
decrypted a message encoded with RSA Labs' 56-bit RC5 encryption
algorithm.  Considered by many experts to be a sufficient level of
encryption, this feat has cast grave doubts in the minds of analysts
as to the level of encryption required to keep private data secure.
"Our effort has shown that it is dangerous to consider any 56-bit key
secure", says David McNett, one of the primary coordinators of this
distributed supercomputing project.
The distributed.net effort to decrypt the encoded message required
massive computing power, harnessed by utilizing the idle, or otherwise
unused computing power from ordinary office and home computers.
Combined, these machines managed to evaluate 47% of the keyspace, or
34 quadrillion keys, before finding the winning key.  At the close of
the contest there were over 4000 active teams processing over 7
billion keys each second at a combined computing power equivalent to
more than 26 thousand high-end personal computers.  The work was
performed entirely using consumer PCs during off-hours or otherwise
idle time.  Add them all together, however, and you have the world's
largest computer.
The winning key was found by Peter Stuer, working for the STARLab
Bovine Team coordinated by Jo Hermans and centered in the Computer
Science Department (DINF) of the Vrije Universiteit in Brussels,
Of the US$10000 prize from RSA Labs, Mr. Stuer will receive US$1000.
US$8000 is being donated to Project Gutenberg, a non-profit
organization created for the purpose of converting the classics of
literature into electronic format for the unlimited public use.  The
remaining US$1000 is being retained by distributed.net to assist in
funding future projects.
Distributed.net is the brainchild of Adam L. Beberg.  It is the
largest non-profit venture focused on developing the full potential of
distributed computing.  Its purpose is to utilize the Internet,
allowing home and office computer users to join forces in tackling
great and seemingly insurmountable computational challenges.  The net
result is computing power sufficient to challenge the dominance of
even the most expensive mainframes and research computers.

In his posting "WILL 'HATE SPEECH' BECOME 5th HORSEMAN OF THE APOCALYPSE?"
Paul Kneisel  says some interesting things about anonymous remailers.  Here are some excerpts, the whole post is about
47K, and may be found at within the next few days, but not right now.
You haven't heard much from the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse recently.
The dreaded "hackers, terrorists, drug dealers and kiddie pornographers" of cyberspace who once caused Presidents and Prime Ministers to tremble and mothers to herd their children into their beds at sundown have been
strangely quiet, if only measured by the absence of significant media
reports to the contrary. Perhaps in these modern times the wages of sin are no longer death but just a really tired feeling, as comedienne Paula
Poundstone comments.
Yet the Four Horsemen once caused millions people off-the-net to call for
all manner of controls on the Global Information Superhighway.
The issue of quality encryption and anonymous remailers has also run into difficulties as a mass motivator for additional government control of cyberspace.
When export controls on PGP were in place, the labyrinthine procedures
necessary to get a copy were likely beyond the capability of most new
users. Learning to use it was even more daunting, although considerably
assisted by new books like those from O'Reilly and Associates.[10]
Anonymous remailer systems introduce yet another level of complexity. By
the end of the process, Steve Harris, the author of the "John Doe"
front-end software for PGP and remailers, once estimated that only 500
people in the world were sophisticated enough to use the whole system.[11]
This represents quite a comedown for a society reared on the dreaded "Red
Menace" from the former Soviet Union or the hysteria of a millennia-old
Satanic conspiracy sacrificing 50,000 children a year just in the U.S.
The mere existence of highly secure encryption systems that potential
criminals *might* use does not in itself create a global problem. Andy
Oram, an editor at O'Reilly & Associates and the moderator of the
discussion list for Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility,
points out that commercial needs can severely limit the use of technology
of anonymity. "Repressive forces have constantly argued that they need to
control encryption and anonymous remailers in order to attack pornography.
But the vast majority of distributors of pornography can't hide themselves,
because they want payment. They have to advertise their presence! They're
the last people to hide behind encryption and anonymity."
Nor are the remailer systems all that secure against actions using existing laws and technologies (whether overt or covert.)
 in Finland, the oldest of the systems, shut down after the owner received a subpoena to deliver the name of a user. The others, as standard computer systems, are as vulnerable to individual attack as any other individual system.
We saw a federal armored combat vehicle gradually demolish the fortified headquarters of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. Is the notion of a cyber-siege so outlandish then, where government computer systems would launch simultaneous SYNC attacks against a rogue remailer system if the same government deemed it was actively being used by terrorists? The recent attack by forces supporting the anti-Basque policies of the Spanish government on the Institute For Global Communications (IGC) site indicates "no."
Of course the anonymous remailers themselves are not anonymous. The owners and administrators are subject to the same system of social defense (or political attack) as all other individuals in society. A simple court injunction would likely shut them down or result in the arrest on contempt charges of any administrator who disobeyed.
A more Orwellian view was recently expressed by Alan McDonald, "a senior
executive with the FBI," who said "that 'extremist' positions on electronic
encryption are a threat to normal law enforcement and are elitist and
nondemocratic. Insisting that the United States had remained true to the
Constitution and to a system of ordered liberties, McDonald says: 'When
people don't know much about electronic surveillance, they are fearful of
it. But when they know Congress passed laws and the Supreme Court reviewed
them and that there are numerous constraints and procedures, then it makes
sense to them. It seems rational and balanced'."[14]
