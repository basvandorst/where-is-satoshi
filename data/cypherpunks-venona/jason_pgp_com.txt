Good eye. This forgery even fooled some of us at PGP.
However, I immediately recognized that PRZ's alleged new signature
line: "I don't put them in the PGPtray...I just turn on the GAK."
was backwards. That is Lying Jackoff Fuck Louis J. Freeh's line.
  Phil's new signature line now reads:
"I just put them in the PGPtray...I don't turn on the GAK."
"It's not a mask, it's an attitude."
