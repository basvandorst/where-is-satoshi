@_subject: Unix O/S 
Hi I'm new to posting on this list (I've been checking it out for a while, really interesting stuff).
I'm a computer science student and therefore a newbie, but am interested in cryptography. I will be taking a UNIX course next year and plan to set up a UNIX drive on my PC.
I'm interested in getting some advice on which UNIX O/S would be good to set up. I'm currently aware of FreeBSD, OpenBSD, SCO UNIX, and LINUX. Suggestions and the reasons why would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks, Gypsy
