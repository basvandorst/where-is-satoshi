@_subject: Thoughts on remailers 
I have recently encountered a situation (ongoing in the newsgroup
alt.zines) in which some person has been sending a woman harassment mail
and threats, etc in an anonymous manner. She has tried to put his name on
her kill list, but he uses a different ID each message. I assume that he
is telneting to the mail port, so analysis of the message headers will
show what system the message is from. I will be happy as soon as she can
kill all his messages and ignore him. But during conversation with her, I
mentioned that it was a good thing he wasn't useing a cypherpunk remailer,
else we would never be able to identify the source. She responded with the
comment that she could just kill all messages incoming from the remailers
and be done with it if that were the case, which gets me thinking...
The remailers are perfect for those who would harrass and abuse others.
Freedom of speech with 0 responsibility, etc. They are also good for many
other things, and the amount of junk mail going through them must be FAR
less than the usefull traffic, however we all have seen or heard about
what a few obnoxious people can do. The problem I forsee is that junk
mailers and porno-grams like the ones I've been dealing with this week
will start using our remailers as their method of choice, and once word
gets around of that, many, many people could put all the remailers in
thier kill lists, thinking "Why would anybody need to send ME anonymous
mail?", and the effectiveness of the remailers would be drasticly reduced.
Then again, maybe it won't be a problem. I'm realy not sure, but it's
worth a little thought.

 I think the easiest way to do it would be for sombody (like myself in
 about three weeks, or hopefully somebody else sooner, or best of all
 several people independantly) to decide on one design they personaly like
 the best, and print up about 12-24 of them out of petty cash. Figure out
 cost per shirt, charge listmembers at cost plus postage and others at cost
 plus a buck or two plus postage. If there is a big demand then make a lot
 more and charge a bit more per shirt, maybe come out of it with a little
 cash to fund the next project... The point is I think we are all a little
 too individualy-minded to reach a group agreement ahead of time, but as
 soon as somebody has a finished tshirt to sell I think most people will
 want one, weather or not it is the one they had hoped for.

@_subject: Key signing, authentication 
Recently there was some discussion about when to sign somebody's public
key and when not to. Does anybody have a short, to the point set of
guidelines on when it is ok to sign? I think minimum requirements to sign
would most likely be receiveing that key from the owner both on and off
the net. That way somebody on the net who is doing man-in-the-middle type
attacks is thwarted, as is somebody who gives you the key off the net with
a false net-id. Anyway, I'm sure there's more to it than that, like are
phone calls ok? I mean, how did you get the # anyway? And what about
meeting the person in the flesh? How do you know they are the same person
you talk to on the net? Thinking too much about this could make a person
.realy. paranoid!

Although it seems the clipper chip's start-of-production date has been
delayed, it appears to me at least that it's eventual implimentation is
inevitable, and close at hand. At that time, a little civil disobediance
may be in order. I have made arrangements to produce 8,800 (that's the
minimum, I don't think we'll use more than that) "Big Brother Inside(tm)"
stickers for the price of 137.95, including shipping and handleing, etc. I
am of course quite willing to send quantities of stickers for free to
those that want them, however donations to defray my costs would be
_greatly_ appreciated, and will allow me to start putting out my
Cypherpunks teeshirt much sooner  ;)
The stickers are one inch by one inch square, made of clear vinal with a
dark blue foreground (If there is a consensus that the foreground should
be some other color I'll change that) and I'm useing the _Excellent_ Logo
designed by Matt Thomlinson .
If you would like some stickers, email me with the approximate number of
stickers you would like, your input on the foreground color, your
snailmail address, and how much money (if any) you plan to send me.
Assumeing I get a few offers for contributions (like I said, if you don't
have the money I'll send 'em to you anyway) I'll send in the order now,
and trust that the checks (or cash, or other forms of income) will show up.
My next project is a CP tshirt. On the front will be "Cypherpunks: There's
Safety in Numbers." and on the back:"Big, Big, _PRIME_ Numbers!". (Sorry,
I forgot who suggested that one... :} )  and in the background will be a
wraparound extended-tcmay-style list of related words and ideas. For about
triple the regular price you can get your pgp public key in RAD64 format
on the back also. Sounds crowded, but I think it'll work ok. Don't hold
your breath for it though, I expect at least a month before I get around
to that. BTW, although I am open to sugestions (In EMAIL please, not on
the list) for the tshirt, in the end if you don't like my ideas, just make
your own.

@_subject: Stickers 
I recently received email from Whit Diffie regarding some concerns he had
about the "Big Brother Inside(tm)" stickers. I asked for and received
permission to repost the message to the group, however I seemed to have
misplaced (ie, hit the wrong button) it, so I'll paraphrase.
Firstly, he suggested that I wait before ordering/distributing the
stickers because without clipper phones to put them on they may very well
be stuck in random places, and that could reduce the impact of a good,
focused, silmultanius distribution. Secondly, He asked that I try to add some more substantial information to
the stickers, such as a short note that basicly says this phone is
pre-tapped, use at your own risk.
After some thought, I sent in the order anyway. My reasons for this action
were that 1) Some people stated that they had already sent me money, and I
wouldn't want to change the facts of the matter after the money was sent,
and 2) Any more substantial information would increase the size of the
sticker, which would make it more visible, harder to place, and would
anger the owners of the property on which it was placed substantialy more.
I think it is appropriate at this time to restate the reason that these
stickers have been (are being) produced/distributed.
Everyone on the list is familiar I'm sure with the clipper wiretap chip
and the issues surrounding it.  Everyone on the list I am equaly sure has
seen at one time or another the "Intel Inside" stickers on Ibm and Dell
and other computers, and in ads for those computer and ads paid for by
intel itself. It is an image seen by a signifigant portion of the
population each and every day. I was in a local computer store not too
long ago when I heard a man ask a salesperson "Does this one have intel
inside?" and I'm sure that he had not a clue in the world what that meant.
Everyone on this list I'm fairly certain has either read George Orwell's
famous book, _1984_, or has at least been exposed to it's influence of
society through the introduction of such words and phrases as "Big
Brother", "Thought Police", "Doublespeak", etc.. Horible images of
goverment invasions of privacy, mass media mind control, and legalslation
run amok come to mind quite easily...
Our Big Brother Inside sticker has been designed to look as much like the
intel logo as possible, without breaking any copyright laws or anything
like that. But instead of conveying the message "This product contains
parts built by a company you know and trust" our sticker seems to say,
"This product is a tool built by the goverment to keep tabs on your
personal life".  It is intended to be descretely applied to telephones,
faxes, modems, computers, and other devices containing the clipper or
capstone chips or other key-escrowed technology.  It is intended to be
seen by those who would potentialy purchase such items, as an attempt to
dissuade them from doing so. It is intended _NOT_ to be seen by the owners
of establishments selling said items, as that would lead to thier removal
at least; prosocution at most.
I think another sticker, in brighter colors and containing informative
text, could be usefull for applying to clipper phones etc that have
already been deployed; a use at your own risk type thing. The time for
that has not yet come.
I hope I didn't leave anything out, Please use discretion regarding what
messages get sent to the list and what can be handled through email.
BTW; My total of sticker orders and contributions (not counting today) is:
6875 stickers sold                                      $166 contributed
I sent a check for $145 today, so everything past that is going to my cost
to mail out the stickers to the people who ordered them. Any funds left
over wil be used as a starting point for some cypherpunks tshirts, and
proceeds from the shirts (if I ever do them) will go to the eff.

I recently bought a copy of oracom's "Programing Perl" (which btw has a
GREAT quickreference guide) and have been working on a remailer mod with
little succsess. My thought goes like this:
New remailer command...
Induce-Delay: X
Where X is any number between 0 and 9999, or the word 'Random'. This would
delay the remailing of the message by X minutes through a simple perl
sleep command. QUESTION: Would new mail be kept waiting by the old mail? Or would Unix
spawn a new incarnation of the remailer process to take care of each
subsequent message?
Mail-At-Time: X
Mail-On-Date: X
Again both of these would use a sleep command to avoid the cron and at
Request-Encryption-To: X
If user ID X is on the remailer's pubkey ring, the outgoing message is
encrypted to X. This could be usefull for anonymous return-address blocks.
I think these are all pretty good ideas, however I'm not very good at perl
(in fact, at this point I suck) and things keep on bombing.

[A very good outline of the history of blacknet followed... deleted to preserve bandwidth.]
I have something to add here... since the original blacknet message release, I have encountered about 7 additional blacknet posts... posts presumably not of T.C.May origination. One had to do with some TEMPEST monitoring eqip for sale, one claimed to have knowledge of some major AT&T exec's sexual preferences, yet another was offering pirated software for sale (what a joke!). Each of these posts have had thier own PGP public key attached, and a list of acceptable 'pools'. Upon adding each key to my key ring, they each claim to belong to  or whatever (all identicle) but had different key id  and one was even less than 1024bits! (the pirate warez key if I remember right...)
My point being, even if Tim didn't originaly intend for it to be a 'real' thing, some people have taken it to heart. Hell, if I ever have anything shady to buy or sell (me? no, *never*!) I might just roll myself a blacknet key and do it that way myself.
On a lighter note, Thanks a billion to everyone who posted a "Blacknet is real, man, stay away from them!" message today, I nearly died laughing.

Applied Cryptography could easily be renamed 'the cypherpunk's bible' in my opinion. It cost me about US$50, and it was definatly worth it. What makes it valuable is that it's focus is on the implimentation of crypto, not just the big math. It deals extensively with the different protocalls as well as all the major algorithims. I recomend it highly.

I just started using this program (secure device) yesterday. I love the concept, however there is something that bugs the hell out of me... I set it up for a 30-meg encrypted 'volume', and the file is indeed about 30 megs. However when I 'log in' to it, a dir shows only about ten megs of space. I tried creating an additional secure device volume, and this one was 25 megs on the outside and a bout 8 megs on the inside.  From what I glean from Applied Cryptography, IDEA usualy produces cyphertext approximately the same size as the cleartext, right? so why the massive difference in available space?

I remember a while back (on this list I think) there was some discussion of a case in which it was ruled that the cops in some instance didn't need a warrent to intercept (or weren't in violation of ECPA?) a cordless phone phone call because the user didn't have the same "expectation of privacy" as they would with a normal phone... it seems to me the end judgement was that if the equipment you're using is easy enough to listen in on, then you can't complain if they do so. Fast-forward a few years to when the Digital Telephony Act and clippper chips have been mass deployed... does someone talking on a clipper phone over a DTA-compliant network have enough of an 'expectation of privacy' to require a warrent for intercepts?

to, or something like "the chicken turns grey at dawn" or
whatever). When you want to check for messages, you string a
message through a few remailers and ftp (it would accept
encrypted reply blocks) *.txt back to you... then just grep
them to determine the target file and repeat the retreval
process... Hmmm..  ok I just realized that this defeats the
whole point of the message haven thing, as it also could be
used for harrassment... oh well, maybe there'll be a use for
it anyway.. but I cant think of it now... damn. Hmm how
'bout this then: just take a message pool like pool-0 or
whatever, and set it up so that when it receives a message
it throws it onto an ftp site, with a separate file for each
day's mail. That way you could ftp once per day and get all
the messages at once, and it wouldn't clutter up your
mailbox. Sender untraceability due to remailers. Receiver
untraceability due to getting all messages. Lack of
harrasement potential (can't force someone to ftp
something). And resistance to mailbombing attacks with the
implimentation of digital postage and storage fees.

Well then, just have people anonymously mail messages to the
haven, with complete headers etc.. then to check your mail
you just ftp over and read the (automaticly maintained)
index file for messages that have a "TO: yourname
header, and don't worry about the 'downloading every
message' idea. This is the simplest solution I can think of
for the problem you state above, althoug it would be a big
improvement if the ftp server had a special command that
means "gimme my mail" or something... so a casual browser
wouldn't discover the names and email addresses of
*everyone* who was receiving anon mail.

@_subject: MacPGP ease of use 
I was talking to a definite non-cypherpunk friend of mine
today, and he and I came up with something that might help
some Mac users with pgp... The way we were thinking about it
is that in your pgp directory, er, folder, you would have
several Icons in adition to pgp it'sself. One would be a
picture of a lock, with the name "encrypt" and to encrypt a
file you simply "pick up" the file and "drag" it over to
"drop" it on the encrypt icon. Poof, encrypted file is
produced (sure it would ask for passwords and stuff, and it
would ask first who to encrypt it to, with the users own
pubkey the default. Another Icon would be a picture of a key
with the word decrypt, any cyphertext file droped on it
would be decrypted. Another one would be a picture of a
fountain pen with the name 'sign', yet another would be a
magnifying glass over a piece of paper to 'examine sig' or
whatever (yes you nit-pickers, I know that functionaly the
decrypt and the sig check are like identicle, but the users
have a hard time understanding that sometimes.) The point is
that someone with some knowledge of macintosh programing
hopefully can create what in unix would be a link to the pgp
program, whereby it would just call pgp with certain options
enabled depending on what name you called it under...

With good reason. It's a bullshit product.
And most likely 2.4 as well, although that's a horse of a
different color.
Not quite. It's not *legal* to export it. But to say that it
"can't be exported" is simply untrue. It "can" be exported,
and easily at that. However, I doubt there will be much
demand for it, in or out of the us. It is slower than 2.3a,
has unreasonable limits on keysize, and is not backwards
compatable with the versions much of the world uses.
Or with users in the usa or canada who choose to use 2.3a.
(and possibly 2.4 as well? Any confirm or deny on this one?)
A total waste of time. Any 'foreign users' who wish it will
be able to get a copy of 2.6 in short order. But that's
still not going to change the fact that it's not a
worthwhile program.
The word to describe what has happened is "disaster". It is
a deliberate attempt to fragment the international crypto
It will be "over" when I can use whatever encryption I
choose to protect my communication, without the requirement
of government of corperate 'approval' to avoid "legal trouble"
I _explicitly_ condemn the _decisions_ of whoever wrote the
damn program to:
        1)disallow keys bigger than 1024bits
        2)remove backwards-compatable operation
I have not yet heard prz's position regarding the
limitations on pgp version 2.6, however if he supports it I
simply disagree with him.

What do you mean by "greater or lesser than the actual key"? If you mean number of bits you can do a simply file size comparison, if you mean binary numerical value a simple c program _should_ be able to handle that without any trouble I think.... although maybe you would need to include some of those 'big number' routines I keep hearing about... and you would have to strip off any header info before computing.

If skipjack is really a 'major advance' (I won't state an opinion at this point) then it seems that they did indeed contribute to a major advance. At least one. Also if I remember my history right they had a lot to do with the original redesigning of the s-boxes in des.

Or could it be possible to put out enough 'garbage' radiation to throw them off? it seems to me that if you knew which frequencies to use, you could blast out cryptographicly random white radio noise which would make it imposible to determine what was 'good stuff'. Basicly the concept is to encrypt all of your wasted radiation with a one-time pad, and throw away the keys.
