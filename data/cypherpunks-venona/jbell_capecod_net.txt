I think that what you propose could be modeled as an
anonymous remailing distributed process.  If designed
correctly, such a process could be made extremely
difficult to shut down (even for us!)  There are more than enough texts written on how to do this correctly; no need
to reinvent the wheel.

@_subject: expiration dates on cryptography 
The discussion between Mr. May and Mr. Shields concerning
time-release cryptograhy raised an interesting question in my Given that trust is often of an ephemeral nature, it would be
quite useful to set time limits on secrets.  Would it be possible
to cryptographically protect a secret such that it could not be
decrypted after a certain time?
I suspect that the laws of thermodynamics might prohibit this
in classical cryptography because as a message expired the amount of entropy would decrease.  Quantum cryptography
might work, but that will be science fiction for some time to
Has anyone either shown how to do this or proven it impossible?
