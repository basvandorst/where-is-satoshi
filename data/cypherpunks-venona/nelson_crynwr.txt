I think the word you're looking for is "proprietary".  I earn a living
from my commercial, for-profit, GPL'ed collection of packet drivers.
No reason why anyone can't do the same with PGP, absent stupid
software patents and stupid export restrictions.  There's a LOT of
room for adding value to PGP.

      You have to assume that RSA isn't being run by idiots.  Either they're
      looking at closing their doors in seven years, or they've got a plan.
   I asked Jim Bidzos about this last year.  He told me they're planning
   on becoming a supplier of cryptography code and expertise.
If they had expertise, they wouldn't need patents.
