As I recall, GAs are rather inappropriate for crypto applications, as they
tend to give rather inexact answers.  In a message where one wrong bit
could mean the difference between "en clair" and garbage, they are useless.
But for simple substitution ciphers, they can enable one to get "best guess"
clear - enough to make the message readable.  Hopefully. :)

I don't think so.  Perry's arguments were well-reasoned and not obnoxious
at all.  Perhaps some don't like to be proven they are wrong?

I object to the list being made a vehicle to ask for donations - I don't
think that this is the place for such things, and I doubt that this has
more than a passing relationship to most of the lists posted on.
