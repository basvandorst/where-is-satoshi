@_subject: Re: Style gettting in the way of clear reporting 
May complains loudly about Meek and other writers style.
Meek hardily needs my defense, he's the best in the biz (speaking as another writer, I add, damn it!) But, your problem is simply one of style, not of substance. Like it or not, Meek does communicate well with the vast majority of his readers. His faux-Chandler isn't for everyone, but he makes his points loud and clear. Steven J.
