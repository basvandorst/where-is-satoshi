For a cheap truly random number generator, bias a diode
near the switch voltage (around .7V for silicon, if my
hazy memory serves.)  Take the result through an A/D
converter.  Should be Gaussian (or Poisson, I forget);
you could generate a good approximation to a uniform
distribution by inverting the source function (see
e.g. Knuth, "Seminumerical Algorithms" for an algorithm
for producing Gaussian variates from a pair of numbers
drawn from a uniform distribution.)

Fundamental property of the switch.  If you bias a diode near the knee,
random events at the quantum mechanical level can cause readily
observable changes in the output potential.  Recall that the diode does
not conduct below the switch threshold, and conducts readily above it.
But what happens AT the threshold?  Thermal noise produces dramatic
changes in the output.  This approach has been used for years to
produce "white" (or "pink") noise.  I also believe (but am not certain)
that electronic poker and bingo games also use this technique.

Some spread spectrum systems synchronize using the (very accurate)
time signals provide by Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites.
I don't know where you read it, but it might stand for "Surface
Acoustic Wave".

Knuth quoted John von Neumann:
"Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits
is, of course, in a state of sin." (1951)
