I think replay attack is not possible in PGP (unless someone has sender's
private key).
On the receiving end, PGP will decrypt the digital signature using the
sender's public key to get the original hash code (MD5) of the sent
message and compare it with the hash code of the received message
to authenticate the sender.  Once the sender is authenticated, it
 *further* needs to be verified as a guardian for the object to be
updated.  Otherwise, a malicious registrant in InterNIC's public key
ring can update an object it is not supposed to.
Only possiblity is someone capturing a signed PGP message, decrypting
the original hash code using the sender's public key, and then trying
to alter the update message such that it generates the same hash code.
This is highly unlikely since PGP uses MD5 that produces 128-bit hash
