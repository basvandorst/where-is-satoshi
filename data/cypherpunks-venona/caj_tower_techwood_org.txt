@_subject: New anonymous remailer. 
Ok, I'm happy to announce a new anonymous remailer, the Tower Anonymous
Remailer, at remailer
Standard cpunks remailer, installed from the remailer installation
script 1.01 from ftp.csua.berkeley.edu, supporting pgp.
Here's the server's public key, which I have submitted to -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6.2
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Response times should be good.  (Note that my network's connection
to the backbone is being changed in the next few days, and this may
affect things in the meantime.)
Anyplace else I should submit the key for maximal exposure?  How might I go about being added to the "ping list" ?

You can.  Wordperfect comes in X flavors.  Be a happy camper.

@_subject: Judges-L FAQ 
It has come to my attention that the Judges-L FAQ is being distributed
by someone who obtained it on this list, and being sent to people made
to look as if it has issued from David Stodolsky.  I must inform you that this FAQ is copyrighted material, and you are requested not to distribute it.

@_subject: To clear this up. 
Something needs clearing up:
I am not a Judges-L sympathizer.  The previous message was posted
at the request of David Stodolsky.  I am subscribed to the list to
see what is going on.  I find the idea of the Judges-L to be repulsive,
personally, as I have told DS and others.
I saw no harm in relaying this message to the list.  All it is likely
to do is create more anti-Judges-L sentiment.  David Stodolsky
claims that they have no desire to hide their FAQ, but that he wishes
for it to be distributed in a controlled fashion.  To engage in what I deem "fair use": "...disclosure in the wrong context,
or at the wrong time can cause trouble..."
A beaut.
In sum, I find Judges-L repulsive and plan to keep an eye on it.
