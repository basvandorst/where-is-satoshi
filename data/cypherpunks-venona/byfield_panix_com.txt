   ---------- Forwarded message begins here ----------
The FCC has acted with astonishing speed in setting a date for comments on
the ACTA petition to regulate telephone calls via the Internet.  It is not
uncommon for rule making petitions to sit for weeks, months, even years
without action.  ACTA filed its petition on March 6th and two days later the
FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment.  The deadline for comments is
April 8, 1996 with reply comments due 15 days later.
After reviewing the comments, the FCC will either terminate the proceeding
without further action or issue a Notice of Proposed Rule Making seeking
further comments on a proposed rule.
Time is of the essence for those who may be interested in opposing the
Notice.  Our law firm would be available to represent parties who may wish
to file joint comments in opposition.  Please contact me privately if you
have any interest.
