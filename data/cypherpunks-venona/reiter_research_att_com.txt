@_subject: new service for PGP 
To all PGP users:
We would like to make you aware of a new tool, called PathServer, for
use with the "Pretty Good Privacy" (PGP) key management and encryption
software. PathServer is a tool to help users to determine to whom a public key belongs, i.e., to "authenticate" the key. PathServer returns an active graphical representation of disjoint paths from a trusted key to the query key. PathServer helps support user authentication policies requiring that no single introducer is relied upon multiple times for information regariding a key.  PathServer can be accessed at
We welcome and appreciate any comments or suggestions.  Send any
comments to reiter or stubblebine
PathServer is an experimental service that is still under development,
and thus it will likely be unreliable and slow for a while.  Thanks in
advance for your patience.

@_subject: update on Crowds 
Back in April we circulated an announcement for a system called
"Crowds" for browsing the web anonymously.  Here is an update on
its status.
1) There is a new, more complete version of the Crowds paper, and a
new web page from which you can retrieve it.  The page's URL is
Of course, comments are welcomed and appreciated.
2) AT&T has finally decided to release the code, and we are working
out a free license for noncomercial use with our lawyers right now.
Once that is done, we would like to start alpha testing.  Alpha
testing will require some commitment from the testers, and we are
looking for serious people who are interested in contributing to our
attempt at providing anonymity to the Internet community.  To be an
alpha tester, you should have access to a machine
- running SunOS, Solaris, or Irix
- with Perl 5.003 or later
- with a high-throughput connection to the Internet (no modems please!)
- that is not behind a firewall
Moreover, testers must be US citizens, due to the cryptography in the
code.  If you are interested in being an alpha tester, please send
email to either of us.  In your email, please describe the platform on
which you'll be running.

@_subject: Crowds code NOW AVAILABLE for Unix 
Crowds is a new system for protecting your anonymity while you browse
the web.  We have recently obtained a release for the code from AT&T and have been testing the system with a handful of volunteers.  Thanks to their efforts, we now feel more prepared to support a larger user community.
So, if you are interested in browsing the web with better anonymity
than the Anonymizer, check out
There are two steps. The first is obtaining the code. After you accept
the license agreement, expect a 24 hour turnaround to receive the code
by e-mail. Second, if you would like to join our crowd, fill out the
registration page, and expect 24 hours before you are admitted. (These
steps can proceed in parallel.)
The system requires Perl 5.003 or higher, and has been tested on
SunOS, Solaris, and Irix.  Our next target is Linux.

@_subject: Crowds now available on LINUX 
Crowds, a system for increasing your anonymity while you browse the
web, now runs on RedHat Linux 4.2, in addition to SunOS, Solaris, and
Irix.  The code can be requested from our web site:
We would like our next target OS to be freeBSD, but unfortunately we
don't have a machine running it.  If anyone running a recent version
of freeBSD on a machine with a direct internet connection (not behind
a firewall, not over a modem) would be willing to donate a few minutes
to helping us port it there, we would be grateful.  Typically the port
doesn't take long ... basically we just need to figure out what args to pass to some fcntl calls.
