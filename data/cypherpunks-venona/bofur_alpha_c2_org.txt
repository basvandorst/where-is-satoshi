It's a pretty sad statement of how poorly this list is functioning when
the RC2 source can be publically released but people would rather
sling mud over glorified keystroke trappers and rant about Nazi deathcamps.
Our friends at the NSA must be pleased with the slow death of this group.

@_subject: France to push for international net legislation 
According to radio reports here, the French government has just announced
it's intention to pressure the European community to create international laws to control the Internet.
This is in the wake of the net publication of a certain book that had
been heavily censored in France.
Does anyone have any more details - has an actual policy been put forward
stating how they intend to control the net? And what do/will the laws
