Yes, flame bait for sure.  But please remember that the only victim of
the usage of drugs is the drug user.  In the case of women of
childbearing age, this can possibly extend to a conceived child, but
that is the responsibility of the _mother_, not of society at large.
Why should society choose to support a crack baby, anyway?  Is the
mother not responsible for her own pregnancy, and, by extension, the
dependant condition of her child?
So long as we, as a society, wrest personal responsibility from the
person, your argument will continue to be propogated.
Understand that I am an avowed Social Darwinist, so I don't even support
the idea of state-sponsored welfare.  In my view (and you are not
required to agree), people should be free to do anything that does not
adversely affect another's life.  If such a person makes the choice to
become addicted to noxious drugs, there should be no support from
society.  The loss of this person from the breeding pool will benefit
future generations.

I was just talking with a friend, and had the most vile thought.
Mallet works part time for the Justice Department.  His job is
entrapment of random individuals.  He has a Web server running the
Netscape Commerce Server.
When a potential victim is lured into looking at Mallet's home page with
Mozilla, the poor sap is rewarded by a server-side push of some small
piece of contraband software.  Many victims will simply move off the
page, forgetting that the document is now in their Netscape cache.
They're toast.  Others might clear their cache, but the server still
shows that the file was sent.  They're now guilty of both receiving and
concealing contraband.  And maybe destruction of evidence and/or
interfering with law enforcement.
I'm only raving like this because the whole Anti-Racketeering bill has
me both scared and really pissed off.

The idea:  noise from an avalanching diode is applied to the input of an
8 bit shift register.  The SR is clocked at some fairly high sampling
rate.  The 8 bits are made available on the printer port.
The questions: Does the RNG need to accumulate bits, or can it simply
present the most recent 8 random bits from the diode?  (I imagine
there'll have to be a protection against reading again before the SR has
flushed)  How fast can you sample an avalanching diode?  (how many
bits/second can I expect to harvest?)  Would a less-than-quartz-accurate
sampling rate be acceptable?  (555s, resistors and caps are cheaper than
oscillator modules)  Or would a device driver to supply the sampling
frequency be acceptable?  What if someone (Mallet?) hacks the driver?
(the driver is admittedly less portable)
One last question... what aesthetics apply here?  Would cypherpunks
abide a largish box, or shun anything larger than a typical dongle?

Whether the distributors are going to maintain the audit trail is
questionable at best.  It only takes one distributor to break the
chain of traceability, and audit trails cost money.
This comes from the fact that PROMs are typically mask-programmed at the
fabrication stage.  EPROMS are programmed in the field.  And yes, if you
could get the top of the chip off cleanly, you could erase and reprogram
them.  (not likely, and hardly undetectable, but it's ever so slightly
possible)  More often, I see these devices called OTP (for One Time

There's a lot of finger waving going on over Microsoft's alleged
predatory practices.  I just want to remind the pro-MS folks of
something.  Microsoft has a documented track record of using
undocumented entry points in their OS and Windows products.  These entry
points allow MS apps to do some things more efficiently than a
competitor which uses the published API.  MS has been known to
rearrange these undocumented calls, resulting in sudden
incompatibilities with competitors.  (remember when Win3.1 came out and
DR-DOS was suddenly unable to run Windows?)  And in the MS countersuit
against Stac Electronics, MS successfully argued that undocumented
system calls were protected as Trade Secret material.
While this isn't the grand-scale conspiracy some people seem to see,
IMHO it's still predatory.  Perhaps the call to separate the OS and apps
divisions is a good idea.  It would be interesting to see if Microsoft
could maintain its edge in applications when it had no sub rosa
advantage in OS access.
