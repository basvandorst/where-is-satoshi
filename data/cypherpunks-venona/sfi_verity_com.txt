I believe this is completely fallacious. Simply because I don't include
 a copyright statement _does not_ mean that my material is not copyrighted
 (look it up).
 Secondly, the issue at hand is not so much redistribution (I think that
 can be resolved by attribution) but rather that the redistribution was
 done for profit. I think that is where you can be hanged (metaphorically
 speaking).
 I do not think it wise to defend such an indefensible (morally and legally)
 position. Perhaps you should reconsider.
