@_subject: EIA and TIA Paper on Crypto Policy 
The February 2nd edition of "Washington TELECOM Week" reports that the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) and the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) have jointly submitted to the Whitehouse a paper that warns the administration about the folly of continuing the "virtual embargo" that is in place for all exports of encryption controlled by the State Department.  The paper warns that the nation will take a heavy hit if export restrictions are not "significantly eased."  According to the groups, stringent export controls on encryption software and products are a blow to both the economy and national security.
The member companies of the two large groups have concluded that it is "no longer in the national interest to use export control policy as a tool to impede data security products."
According to the paper, even the new policy leads to a number of injurious consequences, including the loss of sales and the loss of efficiency.  It emphasizes that there is a growing need for data security products containing encryption in the private sector, both in the US and The export controls, said the paper, "lead to increased risk of penetration from hackers, commercial competitors, terrorists and others."  Hence, they call for the development of cheap, easy-to-use encryption for a wide variety of potential applications, or "the U.S. Government and industry both will suffer."

@_subject: Availability of high-speed DES chips. 
I've got a networking application upon which I'm working that requires high-speed DES capability that can be clocked up to around 20 megabytes/second.  We're going to have to do circuit board level design, so I can't plug a stand-alone box on the ass-end of the network device - it's got to be planted into our network controller.  This thing is going to provide ATM/SONET communications.
Does anyone know of any chip sets that can run at this speed?  Input regarding either commercial or R&D sources would be appreciated.  I know that two years ago at the Internet Security meeting in San Diego we saw a parallel processor configuration of DES chips, but I can't remember which University in North Carolina was working on this.  If anyone knows if this research went anywhere, I'd appreciate hearing about that as well.
Thanks for the help!

@_subject: Re: pcmcia 
We've been doing some work with the thing and have actually got a crypto product built for a customer.  Some things to know:
1.  It' unbelievably slow.  Key generation on this things takes an order of magnitude longer than what you see in the "average" PC environment.  Encrypt/decrypt times are equally extended, but aren't that obnoxious if 5-20 second/'average' e-mail message lag times don't torque your user.
2.  Buy the PersonaCard API Developer's Kit or you're hosed.  It's the only real source of relevant data.  It's got Visual C++ source in it, etc.  You also can then contact Nat-Semi with questions.  You can order the thing (I think it's around $100, but I'm not sure) from:
iPower Technical Support
iPower Business Unit
National Semiconductor Corporation
1090 Kifer Road, Mail Stop 16-225
Sunnyvale, CA 94086-3737
3.  The drivers suck.  They appear to be essentially a "protocol stack" that gets loaded into memory (LOTS of memory) and then they conflict with just about everything.  Lock ups are common.  These things have to load in sequence, before anything else, or they won't work.  We have not been able to get them to peacefully coexist with any other PCMCIA drivers, nor with such things as CD-ROM drivers or tape backup drivers.
Summary:  A fun thing to play with, interesting toy, but probably not something you can actually make useful (yet).

The following is a statement from David Barnhart, PGP Product Manager from ViaCrypt, regarding Ascom Tech's position on licensing IDEA:
"In the US, ViaCrypt pays the royalties to Ascom for every copy of ViaCrypt PGP shipped.  Users of ViaCrypt PGP have nothing to worry about.  Personal users of MIT PGP in the US also have nothing to worry about because Ascom's published position deals with 'commercial use'. The only people who need to do anything are people overseas using PGP 2.6i or 2.6ui in their businesses.  They need to license IDEA from Ascom."

@_subject: Re: ViaCryptPGP 4.0?! (was Re: PGP integrated into Z-Mail) 
We're a beta tester for the ViaCrypt 4.0 product.  They have not made PGP 4.0 incompatible with prior releases.  They've added some non-PGP features, like pseudo-key-escrow and key expiration dates, to make the product more palatable to some "corporate" users.  Many of the features are "localized" to that instance of PGP and don't actually inflict any changes onto the encrypted results.  I,E., making a key expire on a given day doesn't "break" the ability of others to read files from a PGP 4.0 user.
I also think that the comment about ViaCrypt being "secretive" is a little odd.  ViaCrypt tends to be very up-front about what they're up to (at least, they have been with us), and they openly solicit input as to 'what features does PGP need to have in order to make it so you can use it in your business?'  Hence, they now have a Personal Edition and a Business Edition.
If folks have got specific things that they're worried about, I'll try to offer my observations about the beta product versus the "stock" product.  However, I don't think that the perception that ViaCrypt's secretive about the "enhancements" is at all valid.

@_subject: What's anyone know about Teledyne Electronic Technologies? 
Teledyne (TET) is out marketing a "new" crypto system as a competitor against DES and what TET calls "linear" cryptosystems.  They are claiming a non-linear approach in which (as best I can tell) they are permuting the s-boxes and using 4 bit/16 entry substitution tables.
They are also asserting that these "key generated substitution tables and inter-round permutations" are supported by "nonlinear orthomorphic mappings generated from arbitrary key" (and that this is patented) and "row-complete Latin Squares generated from an arbitrary key" (and that this is also patented).
The claimed benefits include being invulnerable to differential and "linear" cryptanalysis, no linear key/data interaction to hide, that this results in the tables and permutations being "transient/secret," and that fewer rounds are needed (fewer than what, I don't know) to attain "resistance to cryptanalysis."
If there's any c'punks who'd care to comment on these notions, I'd very much appreciate the feedback.  Also, if anyone's actually seen the algorithm, reviewed it, or knows of published material about these techniques, I'd also appreciate seeing those posted.  Of course, any feedback from existing customers of TET would also be great.

1996-03-05	PGP-Y Ill Advised
Reader Andrew Rock has been investigating our foolproof data security protocol, PGP-Y (Pretty Good Parasychology). He intuited this missive to us:
"You were ill-advised to release the details of your PGP-Y -- "Pretty Good Parapsychology" protocol on an international mailing list such as mini_AIR. US law prohibits the export of such highly secure transmission technology, defining it as munitions. Your proposal must await government-approved key espcrow [sic] systems rumoured to be under consideration by the NSA. The approved systems will prohibit the possession or transmission of ideas beyond the imagination of government officers. Please do not carelessly put the publication of AIR at risk while I have nearly two years left on my subscription."
Investigator Trevor Green and a large team at the University of Saskatchewan have also been laboring in the field. Green reports:
"After an initial trial period of PGP-Y within our department, we have had some disappointing initial results. While the transmission rate is nothing short of paraphenomenal, the security mechanism is, alas, not wholly foolproof -- everything worked fine, until my friend Steve started imagining that he was intercepting the telepathically-transmitted data. We are sure that this technical loophole may be overcome but wish to alert your paranormal engineers to the oversight. Meanwhile, I am pleased to report that the credit-card fraud charges against Steve will be settled out of court."

Here's some info from all.net and a host of players IRT the "telnet" fiasco and assorted activities related to it.
Crypto relevance is oblique, but some people on this list have implied "knob twidling" intentions.  It would appear any number of sites are trying more than twidling.
One interesting notion that surfaces in this is what's a "normal" automated inquiry for information versus an "attack."  Do I commit computer trespass when I finger someone?  Or do I have to try to telnet?  Is attempting a telnet into a "guest" account OK if I just want to see if the machine's policy is to welcome visitors?  Do they have to post "do not trespass" signs?
If all.net's policy is really "nobody's allowed to telnet in," they why don't they just shutdown the damn telnetd, and be done with it?  Or, if they want only "authorized" personnel, why not add sufficient crypto to secure the channel?
Anyway, it makes for an interesting read....

They've been working on this for awhile.  The problem is that the certification setup does not scale well.  They've been looking at having the USPS maintain the certificates, but I have heard that it's been tossed back and forth between them and GSA and neither of them wants to do it.
IRT the actual crypto being used in the solution, they are using the Digitial Signature Standard (FIPS PUB 186) with message digests being created via the Secure Hash Algorithm (FIP PUB 180).  Unless you're using the FIPS stuff, you'd be hard pressed to get GAO or OMB to approve it.

@_subject: Re: NT's C2 rating 
I have to disagree.  C2 most certainly can be given to a network product.  That's why we have the TNI (Trusted Network Interpretation) of the criteria.  There are actually A1 network products on the EPL.  I've personally worked on both C2 and B1 network and database product evaluations, for example.
Also, evaluation is given to commercial products, not "complete systems."  A complete system goes through certification and accreditation, not evaluation against the Criteria.
Also, the physical security measures make no difference in regard to a C2 rating.  A product can be C2 whether it's in a kiosk in a shopping mall, or inside of a SCIF.  The over-all security policy of the system dictates the right mix of software countermeasures (C2, B1, B2, ,etc.) and the physical countermeasures (public, locked room, not networked, in a SCIF).  Normally, as you boost one side of the equation, you can lower the other.
In short, the criteria is used to rate the level of trust that can be placed in a given commercial product.  Sort of like a UL rating.  Once you buy it, though, the security posture in which you operate it is up to

Politics make it C2.  The DoD mandated, years ago, that all their OSs had to go to the C2 level of trust.  Further, they had also mandated POSIX compliance in just about every procurement that they had to publish in CBD.
Well, they then proceeded to ignore their own policy and they bought MS DOS all over the damn place because everyone wanted the stuff just like they have at home.  You can't play DOOM on SCO UNIX, ya know...
So, in order to not look like a bunch of incoherent IRM loosers, they effectively forced the C2 and POSIX compliance stickers onto Windows NT even though everyone (including some nameless NCSC personnel with whom I've spoken) clearly state that C2/POSIX and MS Windows NT is an oxymoron.  Now everyone can claim to be running C2 and POSIX systems, even though, by admission of MS, you can't have NT configured for both at the same time.
Duhhhhhh...

If this is the case, then why did you discontinue Mac support for your own MAPI standard?  While the ability exists to bind cryptographic protocols onto your MS Mail a/o Exchange via MAPI (as we have done), you trashed MS Mail for the Mac.  Star Nine doesn't even have the ability to port MAPI onto the Mac, even though you sold them the rights to MS Mail server software for that platform.  You have crippled the interoperability of your so-called messaging standard between the Mac and Windows platform, thus preventing third party developers (such as myself) from being able to incorporate the use of different cryptographic engines seamlessly across your product line.
Now you say, "Microsoft is [sic] has already announced its committment       to building cross-platform internet products."  Excuse me, but this is exactly the same thing you used to say about cross-platform messaging products (before you woke up to the Internet).
Now, whenever I have to put together a messaging system or O/A environment that requires cryptographic protections, I tell my clients to avoid MS like the plague.  Hell, I'd rather work in VIM than deal with this "MS commitment" that turns out to be empty lies and marketing hype.
Forgive me if I, and any number of other people, assign no merit whatsoever to any so-called "commitment" from MS, particularly in regard to security and standards issues.

Note that ViaCrypt is now using its own version numbers.  PGP 4.0 is really the same crypto engine as in 2.7.1, but with some new features.
I asked about that, but the answer was indefinite.  I'd say "no."
Yes.  We were one of the beta sites for it.  There are actually two new versions of ViaCrypt PGP 4.0:  A business edition and a personal edition.  Essentially, there's a bunch more key management features and some new windows features.  In the business edition, you can configure it so that keys are essentially "escrowed" in that it will always add "the company" to the list of recipients.  Thus, your company can read your traffic if they want to.  This was at the request of many businesses who stated that they wanted to use PGP, but that they needed some means of escrowing the keys.
What's really interesting is what ViaCrypt has planned for even later releases: support for DSS (and SHA), DES, triple DES, multiple key rings, PC Card token support, provision for large key certificate databases, integration with X.509 structures, and a high performance single pass mode of operation.  ViaCrypt put up some marketing stuff on their web page.  Try:
