 Aw heck, give the little fellers at Wired a break.
It's awful time consuming being on the cutting edge.

@_subject: Hardening lists against spam attacks 
A stopgap measure....
 Perhaps an X-header that changes weekly, monthly, whatever.
Is there a way to configure the list software to reject a message
that doesn't have the X-header? This won't stop all spam, but it'd
put a damper on a bunch of it. A lot of spammers don't even know
what an X-header is (though a lot do), much less how to put one
in a message.
 Lists are one of the last havens from spam, and though spam seems
to be the grafitti and billboards of the future, I don't feel
particularly amenable to having to waste time hitting the "D" key.
