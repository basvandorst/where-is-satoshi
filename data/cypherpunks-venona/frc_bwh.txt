@_subject: What is Real? 
(if it is detweiler, and not someone else...) is for those ppl that say PGP signing everything is too much hassle to bite the bullet and generate secondary keys to use on the systems where they read and write mail...
Once all mail is being signed, we can at least tell when a piece of mail is from a given id regardless of whether or not the ID is a True Name. The distrinutioni of known good keys still remains a problem... In a lot of ways because CP seem to be split into several regional groups between which real-life contact or contigiuous trusts seem to be few...
If i'm not mistaken, there seems to be a california group, a colorado group, a texas group, and a boston group...
Am I the only 'punk in Pennsylvania? egads.... nope, there is Matt Ghio.
Are all the keyservers dead? I seem to remember a new one going up as the one at MIT died.. but i dont have the address for it...
Anyone got a btter idea?
