Pardon me if someone else mentioned this(I just re-subscribed to the list). If the person in question really wants to read his GF's private files his best be would be to guess passwords, toss her purse/diary for the password written down, and all the other basic physical attacks available to him.
  Moral note: If he feels that this is necessary then this is definatly a relationship that should not continue(for her sake).

Alot of the banks in the US are now offering these cards for use with checking accounts.
  When a charge is made to the card it is subtracted from the balance until midnight? of that night. If the actual charge does not come in to the bank, the amount is then added back to the balance. (This was learned thru my GF who had some trouble with her card -- forgot to write down a couple of transactions and ended up at zero).
  I think they should. If they would is another matter. It would be similar to having a 'secret' Swiss bank account that can be accessed from anywhere in the world, converted to cash at cash machines, transferred to others, etc.
  I like the idea of an anonymous Visa better than some sort of new net-bank because it is already established, the mechanism for transfer is already in place, and for the most part de-bugged.
  If there was an Anonymous Visa debit card I'd defiantly go for it. It would certainly keep those marketing types from tracking my spending     Brian

I don't see why a debit card couldn't be anonymous, even to the point of having no name, AND no picture on it. Yes, the bank has the money, but their only obligation is to dish it out to the vendors/ATMs that you have used your card with. Why should a bank care who you are once they have your money in the account.
  As to avoiding fraud with the card, is it really that huge of a problem? As long as noone copies the number(could go so far as no embossed number. Just a gloss black card with a hologram of a Bald Eagle on the front of it), and you don't lose the card how can someone use your   I think that this anonymous debit card would be a good first step towards anonymous digital cash. You still couldn't exchange digital cash with your buddy in Taiwain, but it would work for converting to physical cash(Which I still like, and is the best anonymous cash around right now).
  Anyone here adept enough at finance to write a proposal for CitiCorp? :>
How would they make their mony off the cards? Annual fees, and vendor percentages I guess?

I'm aiming towards anonymous from everyone. The vendor, and the bank.   I guess I'm being a little too unrealistic about my wishes. In my ideal case the IRS and the government would have nothing to do with the bank. Fake SS# is a good idea, but noone seems to know exactly how legal this is. They could, for example, claim that you were trying to defraud the bank and/or the IRS.
  I hadn't heard of this. Its been a couple of years since I've had a VISA card.
  That's why I suggested the blank card(no embossing). Without that it makes it more diffcult to get your card number. I envision a transaction like so:
  1. Card is swiped and the database is checked for your card # and enough balance for the purchase.
  2. If authorized, a receipt is printed without card   To get your card # the criminal has to either intercept the transaction with the database(not too hard), or comprimise the database itself.
  As long as you keep your card physicly secure you should be reasonably       Brian

Go your local library and request it. Here in the states they will search all over for you. I had a paperback copy in about 3 weeks. Excellent book I might add.
