@_subject: Secure Wipe 
Hola all,
I've just started working on a good Mac implementation of IDEA, but I
need a little more info on something.  I've got more info on IDEA than
I know what to do with, but I've yet to find any good references on doing
a secure wipe to remove the plaintext file from the hard disk.  Can anyone
point me to some good refs on the topic?  Many thanks...
                             Ken

Now Jim, you wouldn't be implying that our big warm fuzzy government would
EVER resort to using methods like that on it's own citizens, would
you? :-)  Not possible, unless you count Waco, Ruby Ridge, Ken Ballew,
John Lawmaster, no-knock search warrants, ad infinitum...
Seriously, I think you may be right, although physical security has always
seemed to me to be the weakest link in any crypto chain.  All I can say
is that scenarios such as you envision simply point out the wisdom of
always going armed.  Or did I read to much Heinlein when I was a kid? :-)

@_subject: PC Based One-Time Pad 
While I was reading though _Applied Cryptography_ last night, a thought
struck me (no damage):  Why hasn't anyone come up with a good Mac or PC based
One-Time Pad system.  I'd envision it working something like this:
   * A 1.4 Meg floppy with a single file, or multiple files, of random bits.
     2 copies, one for sender and one for reciever.
   * The first few bytes of the cyphertext file will contain the name of
     the pad file used, possibly the volume name where the pad file is
     stored, and the starting offset within the pad file.
It seems like this would be a fairly easy system to implement, but since
no one (to my knowledge) has yet done so, there must be something I'm
missing. :-)  Secure distribution and storage of the pad disk could be
difficult, but not insurmountable. The only hurdle that comes to mind is that
filling a 1.4 meg floppy, or even a 700k floppy, with a sequence of TRULY
random bits might be difficult and/or very time consuming.  Any thoughts?

Quite.  From _Point Blank: Guns & Violence in America_ by Dr. Gary Kleck:
   "Like noncriminals, however, criminals do many things that are casually
    or only weakly motivated.  Indeed, much crime is impulsive or
    opportunistic, with criminals committing some crimes only if it
    requires little effort and entails little risk (Feeney 1986)."

I can see that for the XOR code, but the code (and possibly hardware) for
generating, testing, and managing the pad files would take considerably
longer, at least for me.  You may be SuperHacker, though. :-)
Well, it would really be one of those "just to see if I can do it"
projects.  I think that someone might find a use for it someday, though.
Besides, it would be fun to write.
No, I'm not as stupid as I look.                              Ken

@_subject: Re: Mac encryption 
I've been using Kent-Marsh's CryptoMactic since last August and have
been very pleased with it. It supports two proprietary (i.e. useless)
algorithms, LightningCrypt and QuickCrypt, as well as DES, DES-CBC,
and Triple (two key) DES.  It automatically overwrites your plaintext
with a pattern of your choosing.  It's fairly quick, and it does what
it claims.
I do have a couple of minor nit-picks with it, however:
1) No support for IDEA.  They've left the architecture open for additional
   encryption modules, but they've yet to produce the documentation (_Insided
   CryptoMactic) for the programming interface. I talked with one of Kent
   Marsh's people back in August and expressed an interest in writing an
   IDEA module for them, and he thought it was a great IDEA and would get
   me a copy of _Inside Cryptomactic_ when it was ready.  I checked back
   with him last month, and they still don't have _IC_ together yet.
2) The Allow override feature.  One of CryptoMactic's preferences lets    you override encryption on any file if you have this feature activated.
   You simply run the CryptoMactic Administrator program from a floppy (you
   shouldn't be dumb enough to install it on your hard disk), enter your
   (entirely optional) password, chose the file you wish to decrypt, and
   click "Override".  If you have the override option on, the security of
   your files is only as good as the physical security of your master floppy,
   especially if you do not choose to password protect the administrator
   app.  How hard is it to crack the password on the administrator app?
   I'm working on it; I'll let you know.... :-)  Until then, I'm leaving this
   option off.
3) The overwrite patterns.  I'd like to see a little more flexibility in user
   defined patterns, akin to what Schneier suggests in _Applied Crypto_.  JMHO, of course,

This is tangentially related to crypto.  I've been reading A.K. Dewdney's
_The New Turning Omnibus_ recently to refresh my memory of all that stuff
I learned in undergrad that I'm going to see again on the Comp Sci GRE
shortly. :-)  Anyway, I was glancing through the chapters on complexity,
computabilty, and minimax trees, and I got to wondering something:  how
many possible games of chess are there?  I know that it has to be a finite
number, but I'm not sure how to go about finding this number.  Any
pointers would be appreciated.

I was reading Hawking's _Black Holes & Baby Universes_ and an interesting
question struck me:  If a Grand Unified Theory exists, would it not prove P=NP to be true?
My Armchair Cosmologist's (TM) reasoning goes something like this:  If
a GUT exists, and that GUT is proven to be true (making it the Grand
Unified Law, I suppose), any behaviour we believe to be non-deterministic
really isn't: it obeys the GUL.  So P=NP must be true, since NP is
an artifact our pre-GUL way of looking at things.
Am I way off base here?  Can anyone with more knowledge in this area
than I tell me if I'm right, wrong, or somewhere in between?  Many

^^^^^^^^^^
We were talking about physical ABUSE, not physical PUNISHMENT.  There is
a difference, unless of course you're one of those people that believe
that they're one in the same and that parents shouldn't be allowed to
physically discipline their children in any manner whatsoever.
When I was a child, we had a room devoted to the physical discipline of
us children: my parents bedroom.  And in that room, specifially the closet,
my father kept the appropriate paraphenalia: belts.  Do you believe my
parents should have been arrested for "child abuse"?  I don't.
The fact stands that there was no evidence that the children in the compound were ABUSED.  The Texas department of child welfare cleared Koresh of all such charges.  If you have any documentation to the
contrary, I would certainly be interested in seeing it.  I don't want
to see evidence of PUNISHMENT, only ABUSE.

@_subject: Voluntary Governments 
Heinlein suggested something similar (along with a few other "alternative"
forms of government) in the afterword to "Who Are The Heirs of Patrick
Henry" in _Expanded Universe_. Heinlein suggests:
    "A State where anyone can buy for cash (or lay-away installment plan)
    one or more franchises, and this is the government's sole source of
    income other than services sold competitively  and non-monopolistically.
    This would produce a new type of government with several rabbits tucked
    away in the hat.  Rich people would take over the government?  Would
    the, now?  Is a wealthy man going to impoverish himself for the privilege
    of casting a couple of hundred votes?  Buying an election today, under
    the warm body (and tombstone) system is much cheaper than buying a
    controlling number of franchises would be.  The arithmetic on this
    one becomes unsolvable...but I suspect that paying a stiff price (call
    it 20,000 swiss francs) for a franchise would be even less popular
    than serving for two years."
Personally, I favor his government that requires an intelligence/knowledge
test before a person can vote.  I especially like his "Improving the Breed"
variation on this one. :-)
BTW, he also suggests the government in Twain's _The Curious Republic
of Gondor_, but I've never read this book.  Can anyone describe the
goverment posited in this book?

@_subject: Re: Nuclear Weapons Material 
I remember reading an article recently (though I can't remember where)
about making a pure fusion bomb without the need for a fission trigger.
It involved using tritium and a class a VERY high velocity high explosives
known as ballotechnics.  According to this article, these bombs could be
made as small or smaller than a simple fission bomb and would be much harder
to detect, the upshot being that this kind of device was more of a concern
than a fission bomb vis a vis terrorist useage.  Does anyone have any more technical details on this type of fusion device?
I'll have to see if I can dig out that article sometime.

But not impossible.  According to Kahn, the Austrian Black Chamber was
quite adept at forging seals in the late 1600's / early 1700's.  They
were able to take sealed correspondence in at 7 a.m., unseal it, copy the
message, re-seal it, and have it back in the postal stream by early
afternoon.  There was only one recorded case of them re-sealing a message
with the wrong seal, and that was because the seals were so similar.
All this is from memory, since I don't have my copy of _The Codebreakers_
