True, but they aren't any better off either.  40-bits is not secure,
neither is 64-bits.
That just means that it will be classified Top Secret and only those
with a "need to know" will have access.  The government can set the
need to know at any level they want.  Even if they truly try to
restrict access to their key, this does not even imply that they will
not allow it to be freely used.  If I want a message read and am not
cleared for access to the key, I just send it to someone that does.  I
have seen nothing from the government saying that they agree to only
use it if they have a warrant or even any reason to believe that the
message contains data that is important to national interests.  They
are free to decode messages and give the information they obtain to a
competing company.  IBM made the deal to help provide an illusion of
greater security, at least before the insecurity of 40 bits was well
known.  They are actually doing a diservice to their customers by
trying to make them believe that their communitcations are actually
secure using just Notes.  Does the packaging indicate that the U.S.
government has access to more than a third of the key?

I forget how it is termed in ITAR, but expertise can't be exported either.  Another thing to remember is that Jeff and the others at Netscape aren't writing the encryption algorithms themselves, they implement the code that they get from RSA.  Though most of the code they get from RSA is already available abroad, if they wanted to import it they would face serious copywrite problems with RSA.  Also, like I suggested before any programers who gained their knowledge of crypto programing in the U.S. and then went abroad and developed crypto software would be in danger of prosecution under ITAR if they ever returned to the U.S..

Verisign will offer a number of levels of certificates.  The
certificate that Jeff refered to requires only a unique email address
and is available for free.  For obvious reasons you should not trust
theses keys for credit card information or anything else that you feel
is confidential.  This is why Navigator allows you configure what keys
you accept as well as what certifications you will accept.

Don't you think you should read the bill prior to condmening those
that support it?
The bill states "Americans should be free to lawfully use whatever
particular encryption techniques, technologies, programs, or products
developed in the marketplace they desire in order to interact
electronically worldwide in a secure private, and confidential
The bill gives everyone the right to use whatever publically available
encryption scheme they chose.  The provisions you refer to about key
esrow simply require the escrow agent to be responsible in handling
your key, this provision is to protect those that DICIDE VOLUNTARILY
to escrow keys.  In fact, the escrow agent would be criminally liable
for handing your key over to someone without a court order.  Your assertion that everyone and his borther has rejected the bill is
simple non-sense.  The VTW and EPIC web pages contain positive, if not
rave reviews of the bill.

I have yet to see the original bill myself, it is not posted on Thomas yet, but I too have ready the VTW version.
I agree with your concerns here, but I find it hard to believe that the courts would allow a broader interpretation.
Here you are dead wrong, the bill specifically states: "in furtherance of a felony."  Its like those laws that let them charge someone with murder in the first if someone dies while you are commiting another felony.  They must prove the original felony before they can get you on the murder one.  The real purpose of this provision, as I read it, is to give longer sentences to criminals that use crypto.
Again, the problem I see with your scenario is that I don't believe that the courts will interpret it that way.  My interpretation is that if they serve a warrent and I don't decrypt for them and they can prove a felony, then I will be subject to the listed punishment.
I disagree, it states you must "willfully endeavor" to use the encryption as a means of obstructing the investigation.  To me, this means that it is the motivation for using the encryption.  If I set up an encrypting remailer for the purpose of allowing free exchange of ideas, I don't believe I would be liable under this law.  The only way I could see a remailer charged under this is if he had solid evidence that a specific user was violating the law, and took no I see some real problems too, but I do not see the problems with this provision to be enough to condemn the entire bill.  I would like to see this portion of the bill ammended to make it clear that only those actually involved in commiting the felony would be held responsible. You are talking about the fringe, this, I think, was added as an attempt to bring in those that are in the middle.  That is, Those that see the need to prevent the use of encryption as a means of obstructing justice, but feel that we should also have a right to privacy.  To say that there is no delema here is ridiculous, crime is a serious problem that we are already having a terrible time dealing with.  I think Leahy realizes that this provision will be about as useful as the "use a gun, go to jail" laws, but wants to give those in the middle to say that they bill will help prevent crime.
Good movie.

"For secure servers, VeriSign currently offers a 'high-assurance'

Verisign's home page.  They are saying that this class of certificate

liable if they were found to have put in a CA that they had reason to

belonged to the company that claimed to own it.

Burden of proof?  Sorry, I do not have to justify my views to anyone.  I am trying to have a reasonable discussion of this issue, thus, the "burden of proof" lies equal on each of us. True, I am not a lawyer.  I would like to hear from one of the lawyers on the list for a more deffinitively.  Since you also admit you are not a lawyer, I do not accept your opinion as superior to mine.  I was pointing it out as something that I believed you had missed.  I find it hard to believe that anyone can further a felony when their is no felony.  In addition, this is VTW's interpretation based on the analysis that they have posted to their home page.  I would presume that they were using lawyers to analyze the bill.
Yes, this case was certainly a travesty.  The thing about it was that it violated the law.  Their actions took place in California, but they were tried in Tennessee.  This is a violation of U.S. law.  Again, this is my non-professional opinion, but I have heard several professionals proclaim that the governments actions seriously violated its own laws.   If your point is that the government does not obey its own laws, then all I can say is that if that is how you feel then why oppose the bill?  Won't they end up doing what they want anyway?
I don't but this.  If I am a reporter if I receive an anonymous tip, a court could order me to tell who my source was, but I couldn't and they couldn't do anything about it unless they could prove that I knew who the source was.  If I knowingly aranged for the source not to reveal himself to me, could I them be charged with obstruction of justice or contempt of court?  Again it is my non-profesional opinion, but I really doubt this. Comment from a lawyer would be If I rent cars, someone might one day use a car rented from me in a robbery.  Does that make my an accessary?  NO.
If you think I am optimistic, you must think just about everyone is an easy dupe.  If I do not quite reach your level of paranoia, I apologize; I will try to get to where I distrust everyone like you. Or are you just plotting to make me paranoid?
Their is certainly A LOT of that with in our government, but to claim everyone in the government is a jack-booted thug is just too far over the top for me. (Yes, yes I realize you think this is niave.)
I don't want it removed, I think it is an important bone to through to those in the middle.  I would like the phrasing tightened up so that it could only be used against those that deserve it.
I was not proposing that exact language, I am not a lawyer and don't imagine I could come up with the bullet-proof wording that is I am not aware of the vial case; I certainly would find such a thing interesting to read.  If this was what happened, and laws exist that allow this, then we ought to repeal those laws, but I don't see the baring that has on this case; I have already said that they should narrow the language so that it will not be used to the ridiculous I am not talking about reality; I am talking about what they can tell the voters if they are beat up over passing such a bill.  You seem to over rate the average voters grasp of the issues.  It doesn't matter that the bill really creates or diminishes crime, it is how the voters can be made to perceive it.
If that is true, than you are left with those that are the oppressed and the jack-booted thugs.  I do not believe that the only motivation of those that are opposed to strong encryption is to oppress me.  Many are trying to do what they think is right, this provision is their to give those that are tetering between the two options an easy way to move to our side.
Good premise, now if you could sell that premise to everyone in Congress than your right this provision is useless.  Unfortunately, I don't think you will have much luck with this.
You talk about my being naive, this takes the cake.  Do you really believe that any pro-crypto bill could make it through Congress with out some sort of anti-crime clause?  Dan Weinstein
