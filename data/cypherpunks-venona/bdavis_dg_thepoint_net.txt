Absolutely.  And why not enter the PR fray by publicizing those successes?  Press release/identify persons for followups/etc.  (All with permission/participation of those who did it).  Certainly, Cypherpunks has gotten press lately, and what I've seen has been good press.  Capitalize on it.
Finally, I've got to say that, as someone new to the concepts discussed here, I found it extremely cool to read about the latest break here and then see it in the news a day or two later.

It may amuse you to know that some other federal law enforcement agencies refer to Fred's bunch as "Famous But Incompetent."
But then their TV show got canceled ....

But their principal reason for disliking it was "Taxation without representation."  Today, you get to vote on those who decide on taxes, unlike the colonists ....

I think this means they didn't ask.
If they did, perhaps the problem is their ability to say with a straight face that their product is "secure" while at the same time running a contest to find insecurities!

^^^^^^^^^^^^^                          ^^^^^^ I think that the bigger concern would be that a small set of judges at each level would be designated JAK judges (god forbid that they all have some idea of what the issues are ...).  Then LEA would be certain to present only the most egregious cases to them until they got in the habit of signing off on them.   Then, the marginal requests for access would slide through.  I think Futplex insinuated that this would occur post charge rather than pre charge, to which LEA would never agree.  You can't indict without evidence (at least in theory :-)) and and if you're going to get blown out of the water as soon as the encrypted traffic is decrypted by the defendants for trial ...  well, let's just say it is better to lose early and quietly than later and in public.
All this said, and after much personal wailing and gnashing of teeth, I *personally* believe GAK/MKE/JAK etc. is unworkable and should be quietly dropped.  With so many ways around key escrow,  especially the existence of PGP, I think the horse has left the barn.  The issue won't be dropped, of course, at least in the short run.  I appreciate all the thoughtful replies to my "Cypherpunks Key Escrow" proposal, and will ignore the few that were, ahem, not so thoughtful.
I've been avoiding posting about this for weeks due to my own indecision, my workload, and a sprained wrist which makes typing an adventure, but when directed to "write an article for [a law enforcement magazine] that is pro-MKE," I had to reach a personal decision about this.  I am generally very open about what I think/believe etc. and have few secrets from my friends.   I get the impression that the majority of you have a different view about your personal life, but that's why Baskin-Robbins has 31 flavors, not one.
I also strongly believe that you gravely overestimate the threat of MKE, probably overestimate the interest LEAs have in your personal affairs, and have little idea how hard it is to get court approval for wiretaps, and presumably access to escrowed keys.  I did mention to my U.S. Attorney that the proposal that "other lawful authorities" [besides judges] could grant access to escrowed keys was especially bothersome.  He took it well, and said that was a legitimate point (that I don't think will go anywhere).
Now understand that, as a lawyer, I get paid to say what my client (the USA) wants me to say, within certain bounds, so I will write the article.  My heart will not be in it, though. I would appreciate it if you wouldn't send this to Janet Reno or otherwise use it, with attribution, at least until I find a new job!  :-)
I stay in enough trouble here without this being circulated through the Department and placed in my personnel file.
Lest there be any doubt: I SPEAK ONLY FOR MYSELF on this issue.  The Department's and the Administration's* position has not changed to my knowledge (except as has previously been discussed in this forum).
*Some of you like to blame the Clinton Administration for all of this.  Be mindful that all this started in the Bush Administration or earlier.  There's plenty of blame to go around.  I encourage the Cypherpunks anarchy to use its recent successes with Netscape, and soon with MS, together with its concommitant increase in credibility to educate the public and the politicians.

I must've missed that day from the O.J. trial.  You are, of course, correct that you can't force the state to prosecute you.  You might try the following, however, depending on Pennsylvania law (where I am not admitted, this isn't legal advice, you aren't my client, and all that other crap ...):
Let's say someone decided to set up a commercial remailing service and had an aunt with an empty bedroom, phone lines, and a powerful computer which she only used to save her recipes.  She happens to live in Pennsylvania, near an ISP that allows remailers ...  She offers to help.
You obtain the service of Pennsylvania counsel to advise you on the legal aspects of your proposed service.  The lawyer refers you to the new statute and says it may be a problem.
Your proposal's success or failure rides on the interpretation of the statute. So you instruct your lawyer to review the possibility of filing a civil suit for declaratory relief concerning the constitutionality of the statute and the interpretation of the statute.  Your civil complaint frames the terms of the (public) debate and is the subject of any initial press coverage before the Pa. Attorney General has even heard of the suit....
