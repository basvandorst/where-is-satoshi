Your kidding, because someone set up PGP to a large key your assuming
their doing wrong and the guy's going to get busted. Wow. I set up a long
key myself but never have used the silly thing, that mean I'm guilty too.
(Gotta go, a black helecopter just landed in the back yard)
    Not if he keeps the passphrase to the key availiable to all. The original
poster did mention it was to only his wife at home who was a risk. A psudo-
random alph-nummeric key of the size he claims can't be memorized so it has
to be on the h-drive or a floppy.  He may as well fess up now to the Mrs before
she publishes all cause she's in.

"See through cloths", wasn't there an ad in the back of comic books
for a pair of sunglasses that did the same thing. And did these same
sources mention how a bottle of lens solution with wired up Casio watch
attached to it would not be considered conspicuous? If you want to bring
down a plane just go to the courier services at the office blocks with
a parcel for across the country, us a gps reciever with preset co-ordinates
and when the plane gets there, ooopppss. If you want high tech thats the way
to go.

If you have ever heard the pipes being practiced you'll know why.

No, what this guy heard was a book report. I don't know how
well a writer Mr. Hager is but if he doesn't have proper documentation
then he confirms nothing.     If anyone cares to look up the political history of the western
Pacific rim, it would seem very suspicious that N.Z and Australia would
have any intelligence commitment with France at all.
    If the PM has no credibility (his saying he knew nothing) how does
his input add credibility to the book?
 Those of you who have often     Those of us in-the-know won't be reevaluating anything. Save your
money and wait for the book to get into the local library. Better to
spend your money on David's book on Enigma.

Well maybe, political issues galore certainly, but very very little
to do with cryptography. I mean what does TWA 800 have to do with this
list. I mean lets be completely honest here, whatever the original purpose of the list was for its been allowed to shift away from its
intended purpose considerably.
