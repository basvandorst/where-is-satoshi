Perry Metzger states (perhaps incorrectly):
Depends how you define harmless. If I recall the original e-mail release
correctly, they do archive all messages. No assurances are made that these
messages will not be used against you (ie- might end up in some file on
you; I doubt that it would be used in court).
To reenforce Perry's point: Any threats against the Prez or his clan WILL
get forwarded to the secret service, so DON'T pull that one. Death threats
are useless (and most likely counter-productive) tactics anyway.
But writing letters to that address are probably at least as effective as
writing to him via US Snail. Keep the message focused on one idea (remember
it will probably be tabulated as for or against an issue) and make sure
that  the message gets across clearly.
Who knows, if a enough messages get through on a subject, Bill or Al might
get a one line statement in one of there meetings saying that the online
community is "up in arms" about skipjack or the pgp subpoenas.

sameer (Sameer Parekh):
I have been poking around in Metaverse this last week, (under the handle of
"PlasticBeethoven"). I think you are very right about this. They have a
whole area reserved for *REAL* business, called Freegate. WIRED, EFF,
Fringeware, BoingBoing, and of courese Steve Jackson Games all have virtual
offices there. In most cases the offices are just shadows of what they
could be. I'm also considering setting up an office there (details may
follow once I get it set up).
A hobby store has also set up shop, and will allow you to order from them.
Billing, alas, is done the old fashioned way.
I've noted, that there seems to be a vague interest in dealing with these
issues, if it does not represent a tremendous investment of time for them.
Also note that Doug Barnes (metaverse: CoffeeMan) and Lloyd Blankenship
(metaverse: Mentor), who are both "Wizards", also frequent this list. They
are also the very same Austin-Cypherpunks featured in the "Bank of the
Internet" thread about Internet Credit Unions. Looks like a possible
Well they already have credit card numbers for most of they're users, they
could do something like Compuserve's MALL and just set up a system were
they bill through connect fees. (At least that's how I thought CI$'s system
worked. I haven't used it much.)
State banking regulations might prohibit the creation of a bank in the
metaverse, if thier customers are all over the world.

Present resolutions? What directions do you think it needs to go? Stego
handles 24 bit TrueColor (actually 32 bit, but Romana wisely decided not to
stuff data in the almost always blank alpha channel), and as many DPI as
you have memory for. I don't think there is much call for deeper color
It's true that GIF only accepts 8-bit color and the defacto standard
internet transmision format for higher resolutions JPEG is a lossy
compression that annhilates the message. Is this what you are refering to?
Yes, it is recommended that noisy images are used as the message envelope.
Scanned or Frame-grabbed are good for this kind of thing.

I found Tim's post the other day on why he quit the extropians list
a tad offensive. In a forum where no one is interested in the particulars,
he brought up the old "Extropian Dogma" argument.
        It would be unreasonable of me to argue the point, as it would be
far off topic in this forum to refute him.
        I would like to state, however, that I dislike the his stating
his ignorance and then pronouncing his opinion as fact. (Or more
annoyingly, in the reverse order.)
        Tim, you are well aware that I read the cypherpunks list, and that I
would interpret the jibe 'certain folks were treating the "Extropian
Principles 2.0" as a kind of catechism to be quoted to doubters' as aimed
at myself, since you levelled that charge at me at the time. Is this a
deliberate attempt to insult me? In a forum that would be difficult to
reasonably defend myself? A tactic hardly worthy of you.
Difficult to swallow portions of the message:
In spite of the fact that I would like to "set the record straight" on some
of your assertions, I refuse to debate this terribly one sided
representation of these events. Events that entailed some of the worst
behavior I've ever seen from all parties, particularily from you, Mr. May.
IMO, levelling these assertions up out of nowhere, for no reason, is not a
way to stay on good terms.

In regards to Tim's Internetpol comment:
I wrote this back in april:
Headline: Emergency Beautification of the InfoBahn
UN Press Conference, April 8, 1996
UN Spokesperson Lance Rotweiler announced today that the "Information
Super-Highway Beautification Resolution" had been passed in an Emergency
Session of the UN Security Council. The resolution sets decency standards
for electronic communications and grants broad powers to Interpol for
enforcement of these standards.
"There's a new sheriff in town," Rotweiler said. "It's time for
child-pornographers, perverts and cryptoanarchists to get off the net. For
too long, we have been allowing these sodomists to creep into our living
rooms and seduce our children through the information highway. It's time to
clean up."
The resolution also calls for a ban on non-escrowed cryptography for
personal communications and anonymous communications, which Rotweiler says
is often used to conceal criminal and immoral activity.
"Enforcement of the resolution has already begun," Rotweiler stated. "In
Canada this morning, a warrant was issued for the arrest of a hacker who
has blocked the removal of various usenet groups that advocate illegal and
immoral activities, such as alt.sex.bestiality and alt.sex.bondage. We do
regret that the individual chose to resist arrest and was shot under the
mistaken assumption that he was armed, but as you know these groups were
