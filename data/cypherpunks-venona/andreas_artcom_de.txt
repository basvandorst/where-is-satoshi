@_subject: digital cash and identity disclosure 
- Chaum went to great lengths to develop system which
                preserve anonymity for single-spending instances, but
                which break anonymity and thus reveal identity for double-
                spending instances. I'm not sure what market forces
                caused him to think about this as being so important, but
                it creates many headaches. Besides being clumsy, it
                require physical ID, it invokes a legal system to try to
                collect from "double spenders," and it admits the
                extremely serious breach of privacy by enabling stings.
                For example, Alice pays Bob a unit of money, then quickly
                Alice spends that money before Bob can...Bob is then
                revealed as a "double spender," and his identity revealed
                to whomver wanted it...Alice, IRS, Gestapo, etc. A very
                broken idea. Acceptable mainly for small transactions.
But as far as I got Chaums idea, Alice would not reveal Bobs identity,
but rather her own. Am I missing a point here?

Ten easy  steps to become a C.A.:
1. get a copy of SSLeay (try ftp://ftp.cert.dfn.de/pub/tools/net/ssleay)
2. install it
3. generate a key using 'genrsa -idea -rand
cypherpunks.key 1024'. Substitute a higher number than 1024 depending
on your paranoia. Choose an inconvenient pass phrase.
4. Use your favourite secret splitting method and send key and pass
phrase to respected members of the cypherpunks community.
5. Generate your X.509 certificate using makecert.
6. Sign other people's certificate using x509.

Someone mentioned measuring power consumption instead of execution
time. I think the same statistics should apply in that case.
Of course this attack requires knowledge of the chip design, but that
should be possible to gain. It's certainly easier than reading
information from a protected EEPROM.

First, what you describe is commonly called a keyed RNG. Such a system
is provably less secure than an OTP, because the number of possible
plaintexts from any given ciphertext is limited by the number of
possible keys. This makes an exhaustive search of all keys possible,
because it is very unlikely that a given ciphertext decrypts to
multiple plaintexts that make sense. In contrast, with a OTP there are
as many keys as there are possible plaintexts, so any given plaintext
can be reached, making it impossible to recognize the correct
plaintext. Of course, searching the whole keyspace might be impossible
if the number of possible keys is large enough.
But there are other ways of attacking a croyptosystem besides trying
all possible keys. Your cryptosystem seems to be based on what is
called a linear congruential generator in combination whith an
RC4-like 8*8 S-box, although somewhat simpler.
I don't want to make any claim about the security of the algorithm,
but linear congruential generators can't be considered secure for any
cryptographic use. Your only chance is that the security of that
algorithm does not depend on the generator, but I doubt that.

The EC-Card system, the European standard for ATM cards, is based on
DES. A single recovered key would suffice to calculate all PINs every
current EC card, the number of which runs into the tens of millions.
That would be especially interesting considering that peeple in
Germany consistently lost suits against their banks in cases of stolen
EC cards, the courts believed the banks' claim that DES is
The PIN verification breaks down like this:
On the card (which is a standard ISO magnetic stripe card with some
bells and whistles to detect forgeries) are between others the
following data:
- the account number (10 digits)
- the bank number (8 digits)
- a card serial number (1 digit)
- three offset values (4 digits each)
The last five digits of the bank number, the account number and the
serial number are concatenated. If I had an account at Deutsche Bank,
this could look like this:
- bank number: 10070000
- account number 0004943918
- serial number: 1 (it's my first card).
Concatenation is: 7000000049439181. Now this number is viewed as a hex
number and DES ECB encrypted: res = E(0x7000000049439181).
The 3rd to 6th letter of the result viewed as hex is extracted:
res == 0x8d6b477bd7a83b7c
           vvvv
and every digit is taken modulo 10:
           6b47
           vvvv
           6147
This is basically the PIN, wich is requested from the user and
compared to that value.
Now things get a little complicated. There are different keys used in
the DES encryption, institute keys and pool keys. Every ATM either
tries the institute key, which is specific to the bank owning the ATM,
or, if the card was given out by another bank, a pool key, which is
common to all EC Card vendors. This latter case is where the offset
fields come in play, the contents of the offset field is added to the
encryption result before comparing to the entered PIN. I'm citing all this from memory, and I'm a little unsure about the
specific way the offset is added into the result, and about the
presence of three different offset fields. My guess is that the pool
key is changed every year, as the maximum validity for EC Cards is two
years. I'll try to dig out all the details if you consider this target
