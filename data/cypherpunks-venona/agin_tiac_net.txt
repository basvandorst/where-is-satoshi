Finally, some real meat for a bankruptcy/technology lawyer.  I've been predicting for some time now that technology companies will start to use the bankruptcy process as the industry starts to shake out.  The PR aside, these filings are generally prompted by one or more strata of large debt obligations or convertable securities, and the company's inability to continue to make required payments.  What DigiCash will probably do is restructure its existing debt structures while seeking partners to obtain additional cash flows needed to continue operations.
I'll be interested to see how it all works out.
