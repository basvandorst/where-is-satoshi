include a public PGP key in the premail program and then sign both the
remailer-list and the pubring at kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu with it. The public
key included in premail should be
1) Used to sign the premail distribution itself.
2) Emailed to various mailing lists such as cypherpunks and also mirrored
at various internet sites, so it cannot be spoofed by spooks.
