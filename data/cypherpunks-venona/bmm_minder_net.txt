Within the next 24 hours, minder.net will be moving to a new block of
IP's.  Until DNS catches up with the new addresses, mail to cypherpunks may become delayed or undeliverable for a short

Amen.  In my experience, no network I've _ever_ been associated with
(private, public, miltary, or whatever) has ever proactively pursued a
security model.  Security has always been defined as preventing a
well-defined (and well-experienced) exploit from being repeatedly used.
Rainbow series, feh!  Even the folks who should know better call NT4 C2
compliant.  CYA is the TLA of the day.

@_subject: Announce - "Registration" Mail List 
In order to relieve the CDR list of some of the flood of "You have
successfully registered" messages, and because some people feel there
is a need for such a thing, I have created a new mailing list for the
specific purpose of being used for registering for online services,
reg  Subject lines of mail from the list with be prepended
with "[r]" for easy filtering, whether automated or by eye.
It is a majordomo list, so those who are familiar with majordomo can
subscribe in the usual fashion.  For those who are not familar with
majordomo, to subscribe send a message to "majordomo with
"subscribe reg" (without the quotes) in the body of the message.
