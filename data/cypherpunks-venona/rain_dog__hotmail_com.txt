Of course, 32-bit AOL allows you to use all the TCP/IP protocols...
Do you follow these hobbies simultaneously, or do you do 'Internet-ing' a separate activity to paintballing your upgrades?
Isn't 'Internet-ing' similar to 'road-ing' or 'railway-ing'?
These two are related?
Fine. Obvious. Not all arabs mug me in the streets of Jerusalem. Enough
have tried to make me wary. Why not shut the hell up bitching about how
much we hate AOL-ers and demonstrate some reason for being on this
list in the first place, other than 'Internet-ing'.

Judge Orders Teen To Be Celibate
CAMBRIDGE, Ill. (AP) -- A teen-ager who pleaded guilty to stealing must remain celibate for 2 1/2 years unless he gets married, a judge Brandon Stevens, 17, was sentenced Wednesday to 30 months probation, 180 in jail and a $2,000 fine. Henry County Judge Clarke Barnes said Stevens have to serve jail time if he completes treatment at a halfway house and conditions that include the celibacy rule.
``Certainly he's got no business having sexual relations with people to he's not married,'' Barnes said.
Prosecutor Ted Hamer said the requirement was based on the judge's learning in
court that Stevens was sexually active, not because of any sexually The American Civil Liberties Union said Stevens' sex life is none of the
judge's business.
And it's not clear how to enforce Barnes' order.
``It's sort of a self-policing type of order,'' Hamer said. ``Nobody's to be spying on him or looking in windows. I think the judge just hopes abide by the order.''
