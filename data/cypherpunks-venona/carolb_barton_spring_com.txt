No, sometimes you don't learn till you've made a mistake.
As you could see I hurt really badly yesterday.
And now, so I can occupy myself quietly for a few days, are there
some good files to read so I can understand, and become a good remailer?

A paratrooper girl named Christina, had just finished paratrooper
school at  Ft. Bragg. She was headed to Mpls, right around Hallowween.
Then we didn't hear from her for almost a month. Then came the Panama,
troop action, over the Haitian refugees. She didn't get picked, so they
let her come to Mpls, finally. If something goes quiet, you can be sure
something's up. I'd start betting on a Cuban thing first, as Castro
isn't getting any younger. The  U.S. needs the insurgent people in
Cuba rather than having them over here. That's my "guess".

T.C. May, so eloquently  waxed:
The squeals of the net.cops were impressive to behold! Demands to
Netcom that I be expelled from the Net, that the "Child Welfare
Agents" would soon be breaking down my doors, etc. Nobody spotted the message. After several days, I "let the truth be

1. You have what I want or need.
2. In order for me to let you store it, I will give it to you
   anyway you wish to get it.
3. I will let you do anything to the data you wish, so long as I     get it back intact.
4. It is no concern (only idle curiosity maybe) where the data is parked.
5. I would expect to pay money for the safekeeping of my data.
6. I would expect the longer you hold the data, the more it will cost.
7. The only thing I am counting on is the data's timely retrieval.
8. Welcome to the world of data "coatchecking".
Why make it more complex than this?
From the moment the data leaves their hands, until I return it,
they have no right, nor I no obligation, to divulge anything about it.
For they already would know, it would take a few minutes to retrieve it.
For whether it's encrypted to the nth degree, or parked in a plain brown
wrapper in a massive unix box somewhere, as long as I the haven manager,
return the data in a safe, timely, uncorrupted manner, I've done my duty.

Many companies are already founded on "a web of debt".
"Sallie Mae (Student Loans), Ginnie Mae (General Loans), and Freddie Mac
(Real Estate Loans)," all come to mind at the moment. They're nicely
formatted, processed and make even more money for investors as the
interest rates change.
So maybe the remailer IOU's, could be traded for the data haven IOU's,
and so forth. I think someone does have a credit card IOU situation.
The systems, and precedence for debt trading are there (and interest
rates are going up again soon, indicated the Fed last week!).
I just wonder who wants to play "collection agency"?

@_subject: Re: "Internetpol" 
Netcops By Hank, reprinted with permission
I eased the unmarked cruiser onto the highway, its 424 cubic cc, VJ engine purring. Traffic was heavy that day, as convoys of Usenet semi-trailers barrelled their way down the Information Super Highway. Biker gangs using Crack steered clear of our sedan searching instead for Internet tourists in Bermuda shorts and Nikon cameras around their necks.
"Unit 7, Unit 7. Woman reporting a 426, over," came the printout on the
Netcops  IRC channel.
Friday turned to me and gave me that look. The look that he gets when he wants to tear somone's head off. Friday is 6'6" and 230 pounds. he enjoys inflicting pain when necessary. "It's guys like this who give the Internet a bad name. Let's go see what we can do to help," said Friday, as he placed the flashing blue Kojak on top of the sedan as I popped the car into 5th and slashed by the Usenet truckers hauling their load of pornographic magazines and political soapboxes.
We arrived at the Holiday Inn where the lady was staying. Her eyes were red and she looked like a Mac had hit her. Under the hurt she was actually quite pleasant to look at., kind of like the girl next door. Her name was Mary and in between sobs we sat her down and ordered espresso from the lounge bar. "It was terrible. I feel so violated. I'd like to
kill the bastard," spat Mary with a vehemence that only Friday could "Just the facts, mam," said Friday.
"I'm here overseas for 9 weeks on assignment for my company. My husband is back home with our daughter and we decided to stay in contact via the Internet. I carry my subnotebook with me everytime I travel. My husband and I get along great but 9 weeks away from each other is just too long so we engage in cyber-sex. You know, private IRC channel, getting undressed behind locked doors and describing in intimate detail what wee are doing to each other. We've been doing it almost daily for 3 weeks,".
"But this last time was different. My husband asked me to do all sorts of weird and kinky things and I agreed, but it just seemed wrong. After our three hour session, my husband called later that day saying that his Internet system was under ICMP redirect attack and that he hasn't been able to get Internet access for the past 24 hours,".
Friday cut her off, "Do you use any protection?".
"I normally would have used PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), but I forgot to install it before I left home. Listen, this guy at the other end must have been listening in on my previous sessions with my husband because
he knew all the right things to say as to not arouse my suspicions,".
Her lip trembled as she tried to hold back her tears but both Friday and myself knew time may heal all wounds but the scars remain.
It was now my turn to bring down the hard facts, "Mary it looks like you are the victim of a 426 --net-rape. There are no laws on the Internet, no police, no government to turn to. Friday and myself act as volunteers in this neck of the woods, along with thousands of others throughout the world who mete out our form of frontier justice. What would you like done once we catch the perp?".
She didn't hesitate for a moment, "I want nine of his fingers broken,".
"Why nine," I asked.
"There's no greater torture than using the Internet with one finger,".
Friday smiled. Mary had made herself a lifetime fan.
We were able to track down the perp via the historical data sampling we collect daily via our RMON probe. We just correllated the packets with Mary's known IP address and the time of day that the incident happened.
Once we had the perps IP address we contacted our fellow "cowboys" in that area who worked with the sysadmin who backtracked through the Unix logs and found the guy.
Needless to say, he will never type fast again.
The story you have read is true (giggle) the names ahve been changed
to protect the guilty.

Now that the damage is done, (the assets frozen) I hope that all the

Meanwhile, a national emergency, could ultimately force one that uses
PGP to have to either work for the Defense Dept. or a related company
that serves the Dept. directly. The Gulf War didn't cause any ripples,
but then PGP was in its infancy then. If they want to limit usage, it
