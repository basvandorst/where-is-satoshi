  Cash need not remain as untraceable & anonymous as it currently is.
If you look at a piece of US paper, there is the embedded strip
(material?) on the left side giving the denomination and the
computer-readable serial number in the upper right and lower left. All
that's needed now is a law requiring merchants to scan bills as they
come in and go out.  Considering the federal activities in the banking
world, such a law is not out of the realm of possibility.

It should be possible to add other encryption options into ktelnet.
  One might be able to adapt this for BBS use either by modifying

@_subject: Anonymous Encrypted Remailer Interface for Emacs 
I finally wrote some code. This interface automates the wrapping of
messages for use with the encrypted anonymous remailers--provided
you're willing to enter into Emacs for the wrapping.
  I've sent & received several messages using it. Please let me know
if you find any problems.
;;; anon-remail.el v1.0, anonymous remailer interface
;;; written by michael shiplett ;;; Any comments or suggestions welcomed.
;;; License
;;; No implied or expressed warranty nor any other guarantee.
;;; Do what you want with this.
;;; Anonymous Encrypted Remailer Interface
;;; Usage:
;;; You must set ar-remailer-list to a list of anonymous
;;; remailer addresses. These must be in a valid mail ``To:''
;;; format. The initial recipients address must also be in a valid
;;; ``To:'' format; addresses depending on alias files will not
;;; work because your mail program (MH, Elm, mail, etc.) will
;;; not get a chance to process them before the message is wrapped.
;;; After writing your message, invoke ar-wrap-message. If you
;;; wish to sign the message, you should only sign the first
;;; wrapping.
;;; After the message has been wrapped, a list will appear in
;;; the minibuffer--this is the route the message will take.
;;; This package requires that you have mailcrypt configured
;;; for use with pgp (unless you send to ripem remailers).
;;; To Do:
;;; Modify mc-encrypt to take a boolean argument for
;;; signing the message.
;;; Allow for different remailer lists based on whether
;;; the transit delay one wants, e.g., fast, normal, or slow.

  I suggest changing "to" to the previously mentined

  I've followed the arguments for having the remailers keep track of
each other's availability. This is fine as long as one can strongly
trust at least one of the remailers. The chaining functionality also
belongs in the mail client--even more so than in the remailers.  With
extensible mail environments, e.g., mh/mh-e, this should be possible
without too much difficulty.
  I don't know if it's been suggested, but has anyone created a
remailer that scans a newsgroup for posts addressed to it in some
manner, e.g., an X-header or the first non-blank line, and then
handles the post as if it had received it via mail? Sort of a Kibo
mail gateway.

  Just last week the Michigan Secretary of State, Richard H. Austin,
proposed adding a magstripe to the driver's license. I don't recall
hearing information on what data would be stored.
  Also in Michigan news, the University of Michigan is moving to a
single University ID card (there are currently separate ones for
housing, staff, etc.). In conjuction with this move, one's University
ID number will no longer be one's Social Security number + check
digit. For some bizarre reason, however, the soc number still appears
on the back of the card--along with a magstripe using the ABA format.
A proposal to encode one's digital photgraph was, I believe, not
implemented--yet. Oh yeah, the card also has one's signature, but
instead of one signing the card before laminating, one signs on a
low-res graphics tablet and the digital image is affixed to the
card--I don't remember if it appears in the magstripe too.

    Ben Fried of Columbia posted to www-security some NCSA
