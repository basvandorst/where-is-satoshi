@_subject: VIACRYPT/PGP Listservers 
Are there any LISTS that are devoted to developing expertise
in the use of the various forms of PGP being peddled by VIACRYPT et al.
It would be a boon to us "NEWBIES" and the cause of "Crypto
Publicos" if such a forum was available which provided some handholding
on the minutia of using the software.
Any ideas?
