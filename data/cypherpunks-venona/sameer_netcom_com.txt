@_subject: REMAIL: Alpha testers for installation script 
probably seen it in my eyes) of Eric Hughes, I have been working on a
script so that the installation of an anonymous remailer (with PGP) is
as easy as typing install_remail. At this point it works *flawlessly*
on *my* system, so I'd like to see how it works on other systems.
proof. A small typo (such as mistyping the pathname of your pgp
executable) will mean that you have to start over. That will change,
but probably in another version. I want to get this out as quickly as
possible so that more remailers can pop up like wildfire, and *then*
I'll work on idiot-proofing it, so that *everyone* with a UNIX account
and crypto-anarchist leanings (no matter their tech-expertise) can be
running a remailer.
~/.forward and ~/remail both don't exist.
on your system, please mail me, with some info about your system and
your tech expertise. (So I know what to expect.)
cs60a-qu because cs60a-qu is where the
install_remail-installed remailer is running there. [It may go down at
any moment, so it would be appreciated if people could use it and test it,
but at this point it wouldn't be wise to rely on it for anything

L. Detweiler said:
install-script I can add this little feature. Which newsgroup? Should
someone create an alt.remail? How exactly would it be implemented? I'm
thinking that simply the user would do:
Request-Remailing-To: sameer
Remail-ID: 572374237
Message with Remail-ID: 572374237 was remailed.

message can be split up into a bunch of parts and only requires about
50% of them or so to be completely rebuilt? Something like that would
be very useful I think to deal with remailer reliability problems.
That would require a good deal more user work though.

@_subject: testing remailers, the keys for my remailers 
take a list of remailers, and ping each of them to see if they are
working, both encrypted and unencrypted? If no one has taken on that
task, I'd be willing to do it.. I'll list here the remailers for whom
I have the keys for... if another remailer exists which I don't know
about please send me the key.

and how we don't plan on making that a big issue-- we will set aside
the politics until *later*, when we have full privacy & high bandwidth
people can decide what to do, splinter into their own groups, etc.,
but until then, as we have a common goal of personal privacy, we
should work together to reach that goal.
differences between the anarcho-capitalists and the
anarcho-syndicalists (A new term-- I've always used
anarcho-communist.. are they similar?) while not taking into account
the people who don't seem to want an anarchic future.
"party-line". Whether your vision of the future with crypto, I think
that having an internal squabble is pointless and futile. Let's work
for full privacy. Maybe for those who feel like debating the finer
points of anarchy with crypto (on an "intellectual" level) can use a
separate list?

This will change, RSN. (It was for debugging purposes.) I will change
it so that the archive.* files are not created. (By editing the
maildelivery file.)

able to have that mail forwarded to sameer and once I get my
semi-permanent class account next semester I'll try to get stuff
forwarded to there.

remailer there, under my physical control.

ground to implement digital cash, because this MOO seems like a very
commercial-oriented system. I know that Fringe Ware, Inc. has set up
an office in the MOO where once it's up and running will serve
people's requests for information.
Review, talks about how small start up companies can get offices in
metaverse, if they can't afford (like apple) an ftp site to serve
their customers.
could lease a plot of MOO-space, set up a digital bank, issue bank
notes, and users could use these digicash notes to purchase products
at the offices of small companies located in the Metaverse.
be that tough to implement a us-dollars-backed system. I.e.: a
digibank would take actual DOLLARS from users, give them digicash
notes, and users can use the notes to make transactions in MOOspace,
and vendors and users alike may redeem their digicash for us-standard
easiest for io.com to actually run the digibank, but not necessary.
Personally, I'd prefer a digibank run by a third-party, but I have no
real problem with io.com running the thing.
