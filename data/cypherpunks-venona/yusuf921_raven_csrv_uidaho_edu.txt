Apparently the only way you would not get contempt of court is if
it were against the law for you to be in possetion of the password
say for example a friend of yours works for NASA and happens to give you the password. you store drug shipment info/kiddy porn (whatever)
and they want it (what they want to do with it after the investigation is
beside the point)
the phrase isn't incriminating, it could be "The judge is a bed-wetter"
what we NEED is a 2 passphrase program,
1 password decrypts your infor for you, the other formats your hard drive
or prinst out a fake diary or something.
the best defense is to say you forgot it, it was some program you didn't want your children editing at the time,
then again whats a year in jail for contempt of court compared to 20-30 (or whatever) years for child pornography

first of all the only "muslim" (NOT ARAB, NO ARABS HAVE NUKES, the only country with nukes in the middle east is Israel) country
with a nuclear program is pakistan, and they're years away from anything
that could be stolen.
second of all there are more deaths caused by lighting on golf courses,
ask any insurance agency.
some call it pork barrel, I call it consperasy theory to protray muslims as terroists.

The only other people who are called terroist are the IRA, and I don't see
the FBI scrambling to protect Great Britian's consulet in DC when a car bomb goes off in London

I was originally going to e-mail this to the people who made the comments, and would recognise what they had said, so I didn't preserve the distinction of who said what, but after re-reading I think it's directly related to Big Brother's attempts at limiting our privacy
the >> are my comments,

We built Hussein, and I believe that Kadaffi was still struggeling to build chemial when we bombed him in '86, or so, but I believe I could be mistaken.
   Every orginization which exists in the middle east has a purpose,
 Hezbullah's purpose is the liberation of Palestine, using nukes would be  counter produtive, like in the movie "red dawn" USSR invaded, but USA
 wouldn't use nukes on it's own territory, because that would make it  worthless land.
think critically, 1) What would be gained by nuking the US?
    there are more Muslims here then there are Jews
2) the objective of "terror tactics" is to destroy a lot of property with    as few injuries as possible, something akin to "counting coup"
   to demonstrate that "IF their intention had been to kill people, alot    more bodies would be found, which (ie more fatalities) is easly    accomplised by simply packing the bomb with shrapnal.  could you be more specific about which "fundamentalists" you're talking  about?
   OY! please don't make generalizations. Iran had a popular revolution and  overthrew the Shah (it's well documeted that he tortured prisoners in his  jails) and replaced it with a democratic parlement, and implemented  Islamic law, the USA urged Saddam Hussein to attack them and refused to  extridite the Shah to be tried for his crimes.
   Would you expect any less after that? Who else called the USA a satan?  the "ENEMY" is dictators who suppress the people from democratic elections
 and the countries who back them. therefore keep your eye on Egypt, but
 they're not very conserned about the USA because there's not much the  USA can do to interfere there.
 that's common knowlage, when Iraq got close to developing them, Israel  bombed them.
 the only country the usa is throwing a hissyfit about is Pakistan.
 (and N. Korea)
the 5 largest nuclear powers are 1) USA 2) Russia 3) china 4) India
5) Israel (believed to have about 100 warheads)
   Uzbek was part of the USSR, and that's where they deposited some of their
 permanent sites, Uzbek refused to return them when the federation broke  apart because they (they're smart) don't trust the russians farther then  they can throw a nuke at them, after all they wanted nothing to do  with USSR and were forced into the USSR by the soviets invading.
    Nukes are their insurance, they're not going to be parting with those  any time soon. China is who they should be keeping an eye on.
   Smaller weapons certainly, such as stinger missiles, but that's
 capitalism :)
   A large part of the former USSR was Muslim and there were strategic and
 tactical nuclear weapons scattered all over the place (tactical weapons
 are used as mines, fired from artillery pieces, carried by short range
 missiles, and dropped from fighter bombers).  If none of these is
 unaccounted for, it is a genuine miracle.
 It was my understanding that only the USA was incompetent enough to develop
 "tactical" nuclear weapons where any grunt can drop them and KABLEWY
 The "defector" is an idiot, saudies were too busy building infrastructure
 to waist money backing other people's weapons development.
   The Saudies backed Iraq because they were fighting Iran and saudies  aren't too fond of Shi'a. It might also be noted that the USA is similarly
 guilty.
  that's deaths from lightning on golf courses verses "terrorist attacks"
 I should have made that more clear, sorry.    I'm glad that you mentioned that though, lets remember that it was the
 USA who was the "terroist" who bombed the civilians at Nagasaki and Heroshima (terrorist as defined in the dictionary)
 by inflating the NSA, and CIA, more people in your department, more job  security.
At least not called terrorist in USA papers, in fact only the British news agencies call the IRA terrorists, american papers seem to take a neutral attitude to the situation.
  my paragraph was in responce so automaticaly equating "nessisary step-ups in security against terrorists" as a codeword for "spying on arabs and muslims" by the FBI and CIA.
The internet is better.

[ deleted] for total anon post/mail
How workable is setting up remailers with psudo-cooperation
so that when it recieves an anon mail it waits 20 or so min
and then randomly sends copies of it to 5 other remailers of which
the original reciever randomly decides which 1 of the 6 will post and the rest simply discard.   a 5 fold increase in traffic will make it harder to analize if
80% is just noise
