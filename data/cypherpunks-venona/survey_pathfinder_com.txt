@_subject: Pathfinder Survey 
Dear Pathfinder Member:
Will you help us on a very important project? You are one of a
representative group of Pathfinder members that we are asking to take part in a special survey.  The answers you provide us with will help us make Pathfinder a pleasurable experience for its users.
Our survey is available online (you can cut and paste the URL into your
browser) at: Please take a few minutes and complete the questionnaire now.  Your
answers will be treated in the strictest confidence.  Since you are part of a small, carefully selected sample, your response is very important to the success of our study.
Thank you very much for your help.
Sincerely yours,
Gina Monaco
Market Research Manager
