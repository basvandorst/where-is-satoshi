My goodness, that's a bit malicious and unsubstantiated, isn't it?

Absolutely.  We certainly welcome any level of comments and criticism
about the SSL protocol and our implementation, and we're recruiting
for one or two more security experts to join us -- we'll be doing quite a bit
of more advanced crypto over the next couple years, if all goes well.
If anyone's interested, please drop me a note.
(I should have sent info on what we're doing to this list sooner, btw --
I can only plead being busy as hell for the last 6 months trying to
get the company up and running.)
They're certainly helping us, reviewing our proposals, etc.
No plans so far...

SSL allows a number of choices for both algorithm and key size.
See The version of Netscape you can pick up from our FTP server only
implements 40-bit RC4 -- the 40-bit part resulting from standard export
restrictions.  We have implemented and will be shipping clients and
servers with 128-bit RC4 and other configurations.

Agreed -- that's for the export version.  US-only versions of both
the client and the server will use higher key lengths.

That's just plain not true.  Servers don't fork any more often
with Netscape than they do with other clients -- EVER.
That's also just plain not true, and completely unsubstantiated.

Amanda, we're not trying to push anything into the standards track.
We're publishing SSL as an informational RFC, and we have separately
submitted SSL as a proposal to the W3O working group on security
(in parallel with SHTTP and a handful of other proposals).  Nothing
is being pushed into the standards track.
We are trying to work with others in the industry and research communities,
via the above actions, by publishing SSL on our server, by participating
in this forum and others, etc., and we are generally succeeding, judging
from the overall high level of feedback we're getting from people genuinely
interesting in discussing the issues.

No, he didn't say that -- you're jumping to conclusions based
on a statement he's making on a separate topic.  We're going to support
security mechanisms as they are required and accepted by the market --
functionality, protocols, formats, etc. -- whether or not they are
called SSL and whether or not our authorship is on the document.

I'm sorry, I don't remember such a claim being made.
Likewise, I don't recall anyone denying IPSP's potential
utility (particularly with emphasis on *potential*).

Yup, we are absolutely doing so.  We do not and have not assumed
that SSL is *the* answer to everything, and we will be doing a lot
more work over the next year and beyond to tackle many of these other problems.
We're listening to everyone, and we love constructive suggestions
and feedback.

Nope, I said we "look forward to supporting it".  Slight difference. :-)
We are looking at it already.
