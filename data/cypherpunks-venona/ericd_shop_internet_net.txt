Woooa there....
Lasers are not exactly expensive or complicated....
Check out  4-15Mb/s lasers.
or Cannon 10-100Mb/s lasers.
I have installed these products *many* times and their setup and operation
is fast and efficient. (used to work for Interop)
We used a pair of these, and MBONE, to provide a 2 way real time video
confrence link joining an IETF session between a room of
users at Japan Interop (local) and a group in Sweeden (IETF). The setup
a was last minute point to point Ethernet link from the confrence center
to a local hotel acress the road. We had 1.5 hours to perform ALL
of the work, from wiring both roofs, seting up the lasers, wiring
the internal hotel/confrence center, and setting up systems and projectors.
!!The Laser setup took about :15 minutes, tops!!
BTW: With this system the transmit "beam" is focused into a "spot" half
way between the sending and receiving units. The receiving unit
is tuned to look for that focused "spot". This means that there is a
very large (area wise) low power laser pattern behind each of the
receivers! With a sensitive enough receiver, it is possible to hear
this signal!
When you need to transport a data stream (1-155Mb/s) to a remote
site, this solution works out to be *MUCH* cheaper than leasing
circuits from bell, bypass folks, etc..
Another case in point: We (ISN) needed to transport a 100Mb/s (FDDI) between \
2 sites. Upon checking, the price of PacBell "dim" fiber was outrageous!
We had no MFS/TCG/etc fiber in the man hole to latch onto. The choice was
As for security, the bottom line is that encryption devices are cheap.
Last plus for these units is that most foreign countries do not prevent
the use of these point to point optical devices. This is not the case
for spread spectrum multipoint or microwave point to point radio devices.

Hughes offers a downlink product called DirectPC.
The back channel is your regular modem.
Telco/Analog your requests to their servers and the data is delivered via your DSS dish,
sent to your PC and decoded via an ISA card. (Opt. DES downlink encryption)
The downlink is shared 500Kb/s ( I think ).
Though you can schedule a higher BW channel
for A/V applications (or so the lit reads).
Think it supports multicast/broadcast by default...

The fire "story" was, I guess, a result of excessive media fodder.
(whatever sells the headlines....)
Example: This morning (Monday 7:00am PST)
STATION A: Replayed a recorded press briefing, with a head from PG&E,
stating that the cause is *not* yet known, however it *MIGHT* have something
to do with the excessive loads/demands on the system during the high
temp season. (AC units running, etc..)
       -- minutes later --
STATION B: A newsperson *read* the news. This person stated, "At a recent
press briefing, a PG&E official said the outage *WAS* caused by excessive loads.
(quoting the same briefing that I just heard, from the source, on STATION A)
Thank you Mass Media!
Reminds me of the aftermath of the last large SF quake.
I lived in Santa Cruz at the time. After the quake we all kicked
back and had a large yard party to kill the time. An, un-named, news
network was broadcasting, nation wide, live telephone calls from people
in the SF area. One call was from a person in Santa Cruz, or so he said.
He told the news network, and at the same time live to the nation, that
Santa Cruz was completely leveled, dead bodies everywhere, and only a
handfull of people seemed to have survive.
Needless to say my Grandparents in Tennessee were not to excited...

Also remember that you have to deal with capacitive/bleedoff issues as well.
It is hard to throw the off switch to an active 500,000 volt/??amp
transmission line, esp under heavy load. The power in transit has
gotta go somewhere.
This gets even more fun when you deal with long haul DC transmission
systems. These systems are the basis for a *very* large capacitor.
MILES of flown wire, air dielectric, and earth.
As metioned below, most all of the protection systems are in the
"protect my local equipment" mode.
So what do you do? The basis today is to watch voltage, current, and
waveform (freq/shape stability). "Protect mode" happens if one is too far
out of wack.
It would take far too much time to cross ref local data against other
remote monitoring stations to confirm validity. The time required to check
the data
would result in local system damage. Lets also not forget to protect the
power yard worker(s) standing under the entrance busses when the surge comes
