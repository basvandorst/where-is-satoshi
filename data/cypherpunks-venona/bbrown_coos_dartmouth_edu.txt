Clipper. The basics were stated.
1) The FBI wanted phone companies to be forced to comply.
2) Privacy advocates said it would be an invasion.
Then they showed clips of terrorists and kidnappers who had been
caught thanks to wiretapping. On the subject of home privacy. I am attempting to build a laser
bug. The type that one bounces of a window. Does anyone know of the technology involved in such a project? I already have acess
to a laser, but it is the photocell that I need more infomation on. Anyone?

I posted about the NSA being human on ISCA. This was a response
I got from Milamber.
  I have a close relative who is a cryptologist for the NSA. He knows much
about skipjack. he couldn't/wouldn't tell me much, of course, mainly because
the last word I use to describe him is 'human'... he's more 'asshole'... but he
said the last thing he'd trust is skipjack/clipper... he says that the
CIA/FBI/NSA/ATF will almost assuradly _NOT_ violate the escrow rules (in other
words, they _will_ get a warrant for the key halves_) however, he also said
that there are so many back doors that they don't need them.  He also said that
they are expecting people to find about 60% of these doors, and they will
correct them when found (so they have a deck of aces up thier sleves) Damn
people.    However, he wasn't directly involved in the clipper shit, but he does have
high clearance.  But he's an asshole, like I said. NSA people, as a
generalization, usually are.  He'd turn _me_ in if he knew I hacked.
