Since you deal with security issues maybe you can help me to learn about some issues with encryption.  I am talking with one of the administration people about putting PGP on the system for everyone to use, but there are issues for them (the admin) as they might be liable, even if they can't read the e-mail.  What other legal considerations should be evaluated?
  Is there any large organizations (like any other universities) that allow their students to use PGP, and have the system in place to make it easier for the students?  If it is offered here I might be the one to add to the mail program (pine) that is generally used to transparently use PGP, which is what I mean by having a system set up for the encryption.   Thanx for any help.  Take care and have fun.

I scanned through the ITAR, and I agree that there doesn't seem to be anything about hooks that are illegal, but the NSA does have the authority to protect whatever threatens national security.  If they are over-stepping their bounds who is going to push it to court to find out, as that is where the decision would have to be made (very expensive).

If the signature is padded with random junk on the end, then it makes it harder to do a known text attack.  There was a message a few days ago by Anderson and someone else (in England) that dealt with weaknesses in some encryption protocols.  It was good to read.
  Even though he didn't have proof Bruce Schneier stated in "Applied Cryptography 2nd Ed" that the NSA might have a machine that can crack DES in 15 mins, and maybe as low as 3-5, as one was built and sold.  The book can explain it more, as I am doing this from memory.

As soon as PGP 3.0 is released I am planning on incorporating PGP into Pine, and start putting it into more programs, to increase the usage of encryption things before they go out.
  I am planning on adding a chat ability to a browser, and hopefully that will be encrypted, as well.

Unfortunately priorities are mixed up here.  Reputation should be more important, unless Alice is actually a group of teenagers that are just having fun at the lists expense, and could care less what they write as long as it gets a response.  If the writer actually cared about his reputation then a digital signature would be the best way to go, but a different encryption scheme should be used for the signature than the   Just my $0.02, but if Alice continues to just not care about his reputation, and people can't verify that the same writer(s) wrote it, then maybe ignoring posts would be a good choice.
