Something is way screwy with Penet lately.  I have found that I have had
passwords required when I had no recollection of installing them.  On
top of this, I am unable to use the password provision due to header
grunging at the UUCP gate, in any case.
.   I have requested to admin that the accounts by number
be deleted in order that I can start over with fresh accounts, & despite
three requests, this has not been done.  Bloody annoying, but I suppose
when we give Julf a big raise, _then_ I can start bitching, huh? 8-)

As a Second Amendment activist, I am particularly aware of the dangers
of an instant-input viewer poll bearing the weight of law following a
particularly disgusting piece of BooHoo/Advocacy Broadcast Journalism.
.   Though I don't see how this is directly relevant to the cypherpunks
thang, I do know that I am horrified at the potential for abuse inherent
in the "electronic Town Hall" concept. I also find that most computer
folk have wild enthusiasm for this idea while bearing no inkling of the
ease with which the process could be subverted.

That's OK with me.  This probably answers some questions for a few
others, too.
 Uu> Here's why. I can't reply directly to your message, as some gateway on

 Uu> This is probably also what screws up anon.penet.fi.
This is extremely interesting!  This "problem" was supposedly fixed some
time ago, but this is why I have alternate accounts elsewhere with more
common names.   In any event, I will pass this information along to the
proper persons.

This is yet another problem that was supposedly repaired - it should
read m..stirner but a curious glitch in the BBS
reply software that handles conversions of mailings to conferences &
automatic routing of replies periodically enters all zeroes in the "f" &
"n" fields.  I will pass this along, also.
 Uu> Another problem is that your address keeps changing. Thus you have
 Uu> several ID's on anon.penet.fi, some with passwords, some without. Your
 Uu> message was from m..stirner but in your sinature
 Uu> you claim you are also m..stirner (or
 Uu> ...!uunet!kumr!shelter!0!0!M..Stirner).
Yes, the zeros are wrong & were inserted by software out of my control.
I also have different addresses, true enough, but there is no f0.n0.z1
in fido; that address is a software error.  I suspect it'll be on this
message, too.
STILL....the problem I have is not addressed:  I cannot make a
multi-line header (as in the required "X-Anon-Password: password" line)
work through this UUCP gate, as far as I can tell.  I have been
attempting to route my mail to the penet remailer via other cypherpunks
remailers with the syntax:
Request-Remailing-To: anon
X-Anon-Password: password
X-Anon-To: alt.foolishness
But I am not sure if the cypherpunk remailer's address conflicts with my
header lines unless anon.penet.fi can handle having blank lines between
the header fields:
X-Anon-Password: password
X-Anon-To: alt.foolishness
The above header will pass the UUCP gate here.  Without the blank lines,
the header gets grunged after the To: anon line.
.   Thank you for your personal attention to this vexing problem.
