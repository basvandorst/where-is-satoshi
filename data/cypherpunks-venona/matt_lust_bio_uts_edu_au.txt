Hi Sherry,
Yes I did in fact investigate this area back in 1994. I managed to obtain
sufficient information to indicate that there were ITAR like controls in place. My liasons with departments did result in some vague answers though,
but the legislation was clear. You can find details about my findings at:
  I've not revisited the area since that time, so there may have been  recent developments.
As you have mentioned, there are indeed controls. The regulations enforce
these through two mechanisms; the first being explict coverage in the Prohibited Exports Regulations, and the second through COCOM related DUT controls via. documentation referenced in said regulations. This latter area may have been revised with recent COCOM activity.
At the time, and I suspect still at this point in time, there seems to be
little awareness that these controls are in place.

Hi there,
Watch out for those anonymous opinions; I received exactly the opposite
opinion when I spoke to the Defence Signals Directorate about the issue
(back in 1994) -- after specifically asking about a few hypothetical
cases. Of course, either opinion may be correct, which is the real
Definitely ... what a pain, however :-(.
Best of luck!
