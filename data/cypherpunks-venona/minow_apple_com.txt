If you have System 7 Pro (and an RSA certificate), you can sign any file,
including a picture stored as EPSF or TIFF or whatever by dropping the
file on your signature -- there are no modifications needed to the
application that created the file. An application can sign pieces of
information within a file (such as the content of a dialog, or the
position of an object) by adding a small amount of code that calls
the Digital Signature Manager. File signatures are verified by the
Finder (or by an application), while object signatures are verified
by the application. The developer toolkit has sample code that shows
how to manage digital signatures, including a drawing program with
signed objects and a Think C class library for signed files and objects.

My understanding is that this refers to professional tax preparers.
Note that individuals are currently filing "electronically" by sending
their return to an agency, such as the MacInTax people.
The problem the IRS faced, as I understand it from a brief report

filing bogus returns with refunds, then disappearing with the money.
LaurenN also wondered why CPA's and lawyers are exempt -- I would

A comment from Matts Kallioniemi might be worth some further discussion:
Encrypting the database with a fixed string offers a good example
of how "locks keep honest people honest." This would prevent an
operator from unintentionally reading a message in case it was
revealed by, perhaps, a disk sector editor or crash dump.
I suspect that the state of encryption in Sweden in the early
eighties was somewhat stronger than XOR (wasn't Hagelin a Swede who
moved to Switzerland to start Crypto AG?), but not necessarily
visible to the general public.
The Swedish government has a rather strong tradition of protection
of individual privacy (encrypting COM e-mail is one example).
For example, the initial Swedish implementation of a national
criminal database in the mid 1970's (equivalent to the US NCIC) used
dialback telexes to prevent unauthorized (and untracked) access.
A recent newspaper article noted that some police officers were
being investigated for unauthorized access to the personal information
of a collegue who had complained of sexual harassment.

Here are my raw, unedited, incomplete, and not to be trusted,
notes from the SAFE meeting, July 1, 1996, at Stanford.
(ps. thanks to the folk who did an amazing amount of work
to put this on.)
burns: fbi, cia, nsa presented to senate/congress: said nothing that wasn't
already in public record (newspapers)
telia (Swedish Telecom) representative (Mattias Soederholm) -- can't import
strong encryption as NSA claims it would harass company. doesn't like having
to tell customers that USA will read their mail.
Whit Diffie - nuclear non-proliferation: proliferation of crypto does
more good than harm: make sure that weapons are under your control: extensive
development since Kennedy administration. Positive control over nuclear
weapon: crypto.
Technical panel
whit diffie, eric thompson (forced decryption, fbi is a client), bruce
schneier, tom parenty (sybase), matt blaze. We came to discuss policics,
but were charged with discussing technology.
key lengths -- too much jargon. question is work factor: how much work
to break system. public keys used only for signatures; actual encryption
uses "normal" crypto. 40 bits == 2^40 operations to get a key. First:
two different points of view: security officer: every message must be
secure, even against strong opponent. intelligence agency wants to read
every message. 30, 60, 90, 120. 2^30 == one billion. any pc can recover
any key. billion billion == des. very clear that can do it, not easy,
however. 90 bits billion billion billion. won't be do-able in lifetime
of business personal data. 120 bits can't be do-able in forseeable future.
but, point of view of an intercept organization; meet in the middle? won't
satisfy either party's interest. 40 bit can be exported. last year, demonstrated
that can break 40 bit keys. Takes on order of few weeks to a month of Sun
workstations. intercept device spends most of its time deciding whether to
record data. has a fraction of a second to look at a message, 40 bits too
large for intercept on that basis.
eric thompson. access data. cryptanalysis -- break codes, build hardware
to aid in this. specialize in defining parts and pieces to break e.g., rc40
amd2905 chips on a board breaks in $8,400 engineering cost. Sell under $20,000.
little company, not well-funded government agency.
des fpga about $1M/7 days per key. off the shelf design using 5 year old chips.
what's realistic to expect the nsa, fbi can do?
bruce schneier: foreign crypto. is it any good? yes. more done outside usa
than inside. many countries asia, europe, pacific have strong groups. algorithm
conferences: 90% of papers from outside usa. hard to get funding in usa.
more academic research overseas. products with more options. here, products
are hamstrung by baggage: key length, escrow. other countries can write without
restrictions. best products from former yugoslavian folk working in swedish
university.  usa corp's cant compete: no talent, government restrictions. losing
our share of research, developement, products. as internet becomes ubiquitious,
we lose market share. restrictions won't stop, will only hurt us.
tom parenty; worked for NSA: "in God we trust, the rest we monitor."
key escrow ineffective. can today buy over 500 products from 60 countries.
no usa monopoly.  home page; list of pointers for our favorite
foreign crypto products (for some value of "our" and some value of "favorite.")
crypto controls don't keep crypto out of child pronographer hands. keeps out
of hands of legitimate individuals and corporations. criminal, terrorist, can
layer foreign crypto on anything usa gov't does. will give protection.
moral equiv of wiretaps? no! criminals: criminals talk to criminals, criminals
talk to rest of world. crim to crim: use strong crypto. crim to airline,
car rental, hotel: can go to airline etc. and subpeona their records:
crypto buys nothing for wiretap.
solve crimes, prevent crimes? would key escrow prevent oklahoma bombing?
but without strong crypto, foreigner working outside usa can take plane down,
grab medical records. etc., by hacking insecure networks.
matt blaze: key escrow. ignore politics; doesn't make technical sense.
fundamental flaws software engineering can't technically solve in a
sensible way. first: enormous increase of engineering complexity.
difficult to design even simply secure (alice, bob, eve + detective
dorothy) system engineering. key escrow makes this even more difficult.
engineering problem is too complex. classified world not far ahead of
unclassified: blaze discovered protocol failure in clipper chip design --
can circumvent escrow field, can forge messages. reason failures occur
not because nsa incompetent, but because problem is extremely difficult.
second fundamental problem: operating key escrow center economically and
technically difficult. 24/7/365, 2 hour response to law enforcement request.
key escrow doesn't distinguish between comm key, data storage keys, and
signature keys. releasing latter may be devistating.
diffie: if you collect data; it will be used (census data used to round
up Japanese in California, Jews in Germany, Holland, Denmark).
schneier: data harvesting: insurance company wants to know who filled
perscription for AZT. crpyto prevents against non-invasive attack; not
against fbi entering house to install bugs.
diffie: crypto requirements of bad people: terrorists need tight-knit,
unified in purpose. tools to secure communication are readily available
"closed crypto." ordinary folk need open crypto; delayed by government
legal issues:
ken bass: counsel for telecom policy:
national security? non-escrowed strong encryption? balance? costs? what are
they, what do we lose? escrow born by nsa mission. didn't hear law enforcement
concerns initially; now nsa stands behind shield of fbi. nsa/fbi has created
arms race among cryptographers. most people would have been happy with des,
which nsa can probably break, but not others. nsa discovered it was doing
itself great damage by pursuing export controls: but biggest danger to
nsa is explosion of protocols, routings, etc. nsa wants to read everything
to see what it wants to look at. fbi, however, knows what it wants to see.
nsa knows that crypto puts it out of business. nsa needs to preserve
fiction of crypto (i.e, that they can read, but you think they can't).
fbi wants to preserve status quo. law enforcement can't undertake survelience
until it knows who the target is. don't need crypto to find crooks. needed
only after you know who the crooks are. fbi foolish to try to convince us
that crypto (escrow) is golden bullet of law enforcement. why does fbi
need to have crypto to monitor people for whom they already have probable
cause (that they need in order to get warrant to wiretap).
jim lucire: americans for tax reform. IRS doesn't follow constitutional
barry steinhardt (ACLU). law enforcement concerned to preserve its
wiretap capability. wiretap happy administration. set records for number
of wiretaps (both in criminal and national security). law requiring wiretap
capability in telecom infrastructure. additional crimes where wiretap
allowed. Janet Reno: four challenges  -- threat that encryption poses to
law enforcement; ability to search for stored information. wiretapping.
why does aclu find it so odious. fourth amendement "particularized
suspicion" -- government must have a reason to search you. wiretapping
is a "generalized search." in 1970's, 50% of wiretaps produced useful
information. now 17% reveal useful info. warrant to search 100 homes to
find criminal info in 17 homes? ability to continue wiretapping is in
question. what is cost to individuals who are wiretapped?
cindy cohn, lawyer: export problems with ITAR: scientists lose. bernstein
case (can export crypto research): export rules squelch discussion and
reseach: first amendment; right of people to talk about science, art,
literature; not just politics. broadness: IATR is overlly broad. defines
export to prevent publication. prevents export to "ordinary" people, but
only intended to prevent export to terrorist. procedural problems: no
hard boundaries.
barbara simons (acm) -- copyright? net community suprised when CDA
was passed. major voices heard are those of lobbiests; not technology
focus; focussed only on their lobby-needs. monitor net? only to
preserve copyright. goals will work only if you shut down the net.
copyright legislation makes illegal to manufacture device to violate
copyright (camera? vcr?)

John Pettitt recalls an question from the audience at the SAFE conference:
It's not quite that bad. Here are a few (more or less strong) crypto
products you might not know you have:
1. Every Macintosh made since at least 1988 has a secure authentication
   client module in the AppleShare Chooser dialog. When you use it to
   connect to a remote server, it notes that the user information
   is "two-way scrambled." (The server sends a random number challenge
   that the client uses to encrypt the username and password. The
   encrypted information is sent to the server.) All Macintosh systems
   running System 7 or later have the corresponding server software.
   What is interesting about this is that the encryption is completely
   invisible to the user.
2. At least one garage door opener company offers an opener that
   resets itself -- an intruder can't record the signal and play it
   back as the "key code" is one-time only.
However, I agree with the questioner regarding the "set VCR problem."
I suspect that the major problems in deploying strong crypto will
be in marketing and human engineering -- and that the current
regulatory environment adds to the difficulty by removing marketing
incentives to do high-quality human engineering.
Note that the VCR companies have solved the vcr problem by receiving
a timecode from a local television station -- making the problem
invisible to the end user. We should be able to do the same with
strong crypto.

Jim Bell asks about Macintosh exportability.
There appears to be no problem using a non-tappable authentication
in the AppleShare client (but this does not mean that the actual
data is secure).
The PowerTalk module (available with System 7.5 and later, but to
be replaced in the future for reasons not having to do with crypto)
supports additional crypto-related functions, including MD5, RSA digital
signatures and 40-bit encrypted (and, hence, exportable) data streams.
Apple did negotiate with the export control people in order to fashion
a technology that could be exported. There are also country-specific
kits in order to meet import requirements. The actual strong encryption
capabilities are not accessable to developers or end users. MD5 and
RSA signing API's are published and, as part of my work at Apple,
I wrote and distributed sample code that shows how to use them to sign
and verify arbitrary data areas.
At the poorly-attended June physical c-punks meeting in Palo Alto,
I gave a very brief overview of Apple's "crypto-related" capabilities
and could repeat it at a future meeting.
This is fairly recent. It requires a cooperating (generally, PBS)
station that broadcasts the timecode in one of the retrace lines.

About 30 (thirty) years ago, I asked the same question at a large
computer conference. Then, a representative of the FBI was presenting
the NCIC computer system that was under development at the time. This
system gives local officials access to a national database of arrest
and conviction information.
I asked the speaker how they would prevent misuse of the system by
people who had legitimate access to it. The example I used was
a deputy sheriff who ran a insurance agency on the side. The FBI
official had no answer. My question was subsequently published
a few months later in a letter to the editor in (as I recall)
Modern Data, February 1966, again without answer.
This question is also relevant to escrowed encryption: how to
prevent misuse of escrowed keys by file clerks and other people
who need access to the keys as part of their legitimate duties.
Since these keys will protect a very large amount of money (consider
the encryption keys used for interbank clearing) and since we
know from the Aldrich Ames case that $3,000,000 can buy a
high-ranking CIA employee, there are significant problems that
need to be addressed. I would suspect that a Baysian analysis
would indicate that the risk of holding (and losing) a key is
greater than the risk of not holding (and needing) a key.

Among other things, investigators were trying to determine whether the

@_subject: Imminent Death of the Internet, GIF at 11 
For several months (years?) Bob Metcalf has been predicting that
the Internet will self-destruct from overload. His argument
appears to follow one of Gordon Bell's maxims: "anyone can predict
the future: all you need is semi-log paper and a ruler." As I
understand it, Metcalf's argument is that network load (messages,
packets) is growing exponentially, while network bandwidth (fiber
capacity, switch performance) is growing linearly. At some point,
these two curves cross -- and demand will exceed capacity.
There are two solutions to this problem: either there will be
a fundamental change in the way messages move on the Internet
(i.e. they  don't all have to pass through Mae East and/or Mae West)
or there will be a fundamental change in the way we use the Internet.
We certainly are seeing changes in the way we use the network. When
I "got on the net" in the late 1970's, I was on two mailing lists
(SF-Lovers and Human Net) and could read *all* of Usenet traffic
in an hour or two. In the late 1980's, Usenet traffic totalled
about 10 MB/Day. Now, I'm on a handful of work-dependent, low
bandwidth mailing lists, one high-bandwidth, high noise mailing
list, almost never read Usenet and wouldn't dare attempt to support
a Usenet newsserver. Today, it takes longer for me to read mail on
an office Internet or 28.8 modem at home, than it did in 1980 on a
2400 baud modem.
To make a long story short, I suspect that we will be much more
selective in what we access on the net; we may hire editors (or
form communities that share "interesting stuff", each person
serving as one member of an informal editorial board). We will
also see organizations (companies or professional societies) funding
network-based publications to communicate matters of common interest.
(There are a number of these already, Risks Digest being possibly
the most important.)
So, in one sense, Metcalf is right; the Internet will self-destruct.
However, in another sense, he is wrong; the information carried
on the Internet will still be distributed, but probably in a
different form.

There is an inherent conflict between two claims that are
central to the fault-analysis paper(s):
   "the secret key [is] stored in a tamperproof cryptographic device"
   "the cryptographic key is stored in an asymmetric type of
    memory, in which induced faults ..."
If the device is truly tamperproof, the attacker should not
be able to induce faults.  Even given susceptable "consumer-
quality" devices, it would be trivial to store the cryptographic keys
in a redundant memory configuration, such as ECC "error-correcting
code" memory that can self-correct a range of failures and detect
a much wider range. It would also seem reasonable to protect the
cryptographic core (algorithms and data) with a digital signature
that would "crash" the device, rather than proceed with incorrect
key information.
My naive reading of the attack suggests that storing the cryptographic
key together with its one's complement would minimize the chance that
an attacker can exploit asymmetric fault inducement.
Finally, I'm curious whether this attack would work on masked ROM
or fusable-link (one-time programmable) PROMs (not EPROMs that have
no reprogramming window). These are more likely to be used in
production devices than EEPROMs, if only for cost-savings.

                          November 15, 1996
  Dear Mr. Speaker:     (Dear Mr. President:)
  In order to take additional steps with respect to the
  national emergency described and declared in Executive
  Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, and continued on August 15,
  1995, and August 14, 1996, necessitated by the expiration of
  the Export Administration Act (EAA) on August 20, 1994, I hereby
  report to the Congress that pursuant to section 204(b) of the
  International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b)
  (the "Act"), I have today exercised the authority granted by the
  Act to issue an Executive order (a copy of which is attached) to
  revise the provisions that apply to the administration of the
  export control system maintained by Department of Commerce in
  the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Part 730 et seq.
  The new Executive order relates to my decision to transfer
  certain encryption products from the United States Munitions
  List administered by the Department of State to the Commerce
  Control List administered by the Department of Commerce.
  When I made that decision I also decided to amend Executive
  Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, which sets forth procedures
  for the interagency review and disposition of dual-use export
  license applications, to include the Department of Justice
  among the agencies that have the opportunity to review such
  applications with respect to encryption products transferred
  to Department of Commerce control.
  Also, in issuing the new order, I provided for appropriate
  controls on the export and foreign dissemination of encryption
  products transferred to the Department of Commerce.  Among
  other provisions, I determined that the export of encryption
  products transferred to Department of Commerce control could
  harm national security and foreign policy interests of the
  United States even where comparable products are or appear to
  be available from foreign sources.  Accordingly, the new order
  makes clear that any EAA provision dealing with issuance of
  licenses or removal of controls based on foreign availability
  considerations shall not apply with respect to export controls
  on such encryption products.  Notwithstanding this, the
  Secretary of Commerce retains the discretion to consider the
  foreign availability of comparable encryption products in any
  particular case.
                                Sincerely,

  SUBJECT:       Encryption Export Policy
  Encryption products, when used outside the United States, can
  jeopardize our foreign policy and national security interests.
  Moreover, such products, when used by international criminal
  organizations, can threaten the safety of U.S. citizens here
  and abroad, as well as the safety of the citizens of other
  countries.  The exportation of encryption products accordingly
  must be controlled to further U.S. foreign policy objectives,
  and promote our national security, including the protection of
  the safety of U.S. citizens abroad.  Nonetheless, because of
  the increasingly widespread use of encryption products for the
  legitimate protection of the privacy of data and communications
  in nonmilitary contexts; because of the importance to U.S.
  economic interests of the market for encryption products;
  and because, pursuant to the terms set forth in the Executive
  order entitled Administration of Export Controls on Encryption
  Products (the "new Executive order") of November 15, 1996,
  Commerce Department controls of the export of such dual-use
  encryption products can be accomplished without compromising
  U.S. foreign policy objectives and national security interests,
  I have determined at this time not to continue to designate such
  encryption products as defense articles on the United States
  Munitions List.
  Accordingly, under the powers vested in me by the Constitution
  and the laws of the United States, I direct that:
  1.  Encryption products that presently are or would be
  designated in Category XIII of the United States Munitions
  List and regulated by the Department of State pursuant to
  the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq.) shall
  be transferred to the Commerce Control List, and regulated

  of December 5, 1995, and the new Executive order except
  that encryption products specifically designed, developed,
  configured, adapted, or modified for military applications
  (including command, control, and intelligence applications),
  shall continue to be designated as defense articles, shall
  remain on the United States Munitions List, and shall continue
  to be controlled under the Arms Export Control Act.  The
  transfer described in this paragraph shall be effective upon
  the issuance of final regulations (the "Final Regulations")
  implementing the safeguards specified in this directive and
  in the new Executive order.
  2.  The Final Regulations shall specify that the encryption
  products specified in section 1 of this memorandum shall be
  placed on the Commerce Control List administered by the
  Department of Commerce.  The Department of Commerce shall,
  to the extent permitted by law, administer the export of such
  encryption products, including encryption software, pursuant
  to the requirements of sections 5 and 6 of the former Export
  Administration Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2405 and 2406), and the
  regulations thereunder, as continued in effect by Executive
  Order 12924 of August 19, 1994 (continued on August 15, 1995,
  and on August 14, 1996), except as otherwise indicated in or
  modified by the new Executive order, Executive Order 12981 of
  December 5, 1995, and any Executive orders and laws cited
  therein.
  3.  The Final Regulations shall provide that encryption
  products described in section 1 of this memorandum can be
  licensed for export only if the requirements of the controls
  of both sections 5 and 6 of the former Export Administration
  Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2405 and 2406), and the regulations
  thereunder, as modified by the new Executive order, Executive
  Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, and any Executive orders
  and laws cited therein, are satisfied.  Consistent with
  section 742.1(f) of the current Export Administration
  Regulations, the Final Regulations shall ensure that a license
  for such a product will be issued only if an application can
  be and is approved under both section 5 and section 6.  The
  controls on such products will apply to all destinations.
  Except for those products transferred to the Commerce Control
  List prior to the effective date of the Final Regulations,
  exports and reexports of encryption products shall initially be
  subject to case-by-case review to ensure that export thereof
  would be consistent with U.S. foreign policy objectives and
  national security interests, including the safety of U.S.
  citizens.  Consideration shall be given to more liberalized
  licensing treatment of each such individual product after
  interagency review is completed.  The Final Regulations shall
  also effectuate all other specific objectives and directives set
  forth in this directive.
  4.  Because encryption source code can easily and mechanically
  be transformed into object code, and because export of such
  source code is controlled because of the code's functional
  capacity, rather than because of any "information" such code
  might convey, the Final Regulations shall specify that
  encryption source code shall be treated as an encryption
  product, and not as technical data or technology, for export
  licensing purposes.
  5.  All provisions in the Final Regulations regarding
  "de minimis" domestic content of items shall not apply with
  respect to the encryption products described in paragraph 1
  of this memorandum.

                                  3
  6.  The Final Regulations shall, in a manner consistent with
  section 16(5)(C) of the EAA, 50 U.S.C. App. 2415(5)(C), provide
  that it will constitute an export of encryption source code
  or object code software for a person to make such software
  available for transfer outside the United States, over radio,
  electromagnetic, photooptical, or photoelectric communications
  facilities accessible to persons outside the United States,
  including transfer from electronic bulletin boards and Internet
  file transfer protocol sites, unless the party making the
  software available takes precautions adequate to prevent the
  unauthorized transfer of such code outside the United States.
  7.  Until the Final Regulations are issued, the Department of
  State shall continue to have authority to administer the export
  of encryption products described in section 1 of this memorandum
  as defense articles designated in Category XIII of the United
  States Munitions List, pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act.
  8.  Upon enactment of any legislation reauthorizing the
  administration of export controls, the Secretary of Defense,
  the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General shall reexamine
  whether adequate controls on encryption products can be
  maintained under the provisions of the new statute and advise
  the Secretary of Commerce of their conclusions as well as any
  recommendations for action.  If adequate controls on encryption
  products cannot be maintained under a new statute, then such
  products shall, where consistent with law, be designated or
  redesignated as defense articles under 22 U.S.C. 2778(a)(1),
  to be placed on the United States Munitions List and controlled
  pursuant to the terms of the Arms Export Control Act and the
  International Traffic in Arms Regulations.  Any disputes
  regarding the decision to designate or redesignate shall be
  resolved by the President.

                            - - - - - - -
       ADMINISTRATION OF EXPORT CONTROLS ON ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS
       By the authority vested in me as President by the
  Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
  including but not limited to the International Emergency
  Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), and in order to
  take additional steps with respect to the national emergency
  described and declared in Executive Order 12924 of August 19,
  1994, and continued on August 15, 1995, and on August 14, 1996,
  I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of
  America, have decided that the provisions set forth below shall
  apply to administration of the export control system maintained
  by the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Part 730
  et seq. ("the EAR").  Accordingly, it is hereby ordered as
  follows:
       Section 1.  Treatment of Encryption Products.  In order
  to provide for appropriate controls on the export and foreign
  dissemination of encryption products, export controls of
  encryption products that are or would be, on this date,
  designated as defense articles in Category XIII of the
  United States Munitions List and regulated by the United States
  Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act,
  22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq. ("the AECA"), but that subsequently are
  placed on the Commerce Control List in the EAR, shall be subject
  to the following conditions:  (a)  I have determined that the
  export of encryption products described in this section could
  harm national security and foreign policy interests even where
  comparable products are or appear to be available from sources
  outside the United States, and that facts and questions
  concerning the foreign availability of such encryption products
  cannot be made subject to public disclosure or judicial review
  without revealing or implicating classified information that
  could harm United States national security and foreign policy
  interests.  Accordingly, sections 4(c) and 6(h)(2)-(4) of
  the Export Administration Act of 1979 ("the EAA"), 50 U.S.C.
  App. 2403(c) and 2405(h)(2)-(4), as amended and as continued
  in effect by Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, and
  by notices of August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996, all
  other analogous provisions of the EAA relating to foreign
  availability, and the regulations in the EAR relating to such
  EAA provisions, shall not be applicable with respect to export
  controls on such encryption products.  Notwithstanding this,
  the Secretary of Commerce ("Secretary") may, in his discretion,
  consider the foreign availability of comparable encryption
  products in determining whether to issue a license in a
  particular case or to remove controls on particular products,
  but is not required to issue licenses in particular cases or
  to remove controls on particular products based on such
  consideration;
       (b)  Executive Order 12981, as amended by Executive
  Order 13020 of October 12, 1996, is further amended as follows:
       (1)  A new section 6 is added to read as follows:
  "Sec. 6.  Encryption Products.  In conducting the license
  review described in section 1 above, with respect to export
  controls of encryption products that are or would be, on
  November 15, 1996, designated as defense articles in Category
                                 more

                                  2
  XIII of the United States Munitions List and regulated by the
  United States Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export
  Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq., but that subsequently are
  placed on the Commerce Control List in the Export Administration
  Regulations, the Departments of State, Defense, Energy, and
  Justice and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency shall have
  the opportunity to review any export license application
  submitted to the Department of Commerce.  The Department of
  Justice shall, with respect to such encryption products, be a
  voting member of the Export Administration Review Board
  described in section 5(a)(1) of this order and of the Advisory
  Committee on Export Policy described in section 5(a)(2) of this
  order.  The Department of Justice shall be a full member of the
  Operating Committee of the ACEP described in section 5(a)(3) of
  this order, and of any other committees and consultation groups
  reviewing export controls with respect to such encryption
  products."
       (2)  Sections 6 and 7 of Executive Order 12981 of
  December 5, 1995, are renumbered as new sections 7 and 8,
  respectively.
       (c)  Because the export of encryption software, like the
  export of other encryption products described in this section,
  must be controlled because of such software's functional
  capacity, rather than because of any possible informational
  value of such software, such software shall not be considered
  or treated as "technology," as that term is defined in
  section 16 of the EAA (50 U.S.C. App. 2415) and in the EAR
  (61 Fed. Reg. 12714, March 25, 1996);
       (d)  With respect to encryption products described in this
  section, the Secretary shall take such actions, including the
  promulgation of rules, regulations, and amendments thereto, as
  may be necessary to control the export of assistance (including
  training) to foreign persons in the same manner and to the same
  extent as the export of such assistance is controlled under the
  AECA, as amended by section 151 of Public Law 104-164;
       (e)  Appropriate controls on the export and foreign
  dissemination of encryption products described in this section
  may include, but are not limited to, measures that promote the
  use of strong encryption products and the development of a key
  recovery management infrastructure; and
       (f)  Regulation of encryption products described in this
  section shall be subject to such further conditions as the
  President may direct.
       Sec. 2.  Effective Date.  The provisions described in
  section 1 shall take effect as soon as any encryption products
  described in section 1 are placed on the Commerce Control List
  in the EAR.
       Sec. 3.  Judicial Review.  This order is intended only to
  improve the internal management of the executive branch and to
  ensure the implementation of appropriate controls on the export
  and foreign dissemination of encryption products.  It is not
  intended to, and does not, create any rights to administrative
  or judicial review, or any other right or benefit or trust
  responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable
  by a party against the United States, its agencies or
  instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other
  person.

@_subject: Computer CPU chips with built-in crypto? 
In a note to cypherpunks, Hal Finney comments on the new crypto
I'm not sure if I can answer this but, at last week's SF cypherpunks
meeting, an Intel engineer asked whether there might be any interest
in a computer chip with some sort of encryption mechanism built
into the chip. As I understand it, this chip would process an
encrypted instruction stream. I.e., it could not execute a program
unless the "key" for that program was first loaded into the chip.
An interesting idea: does anyone have more information?

@_subject: Re: Computer CPU chips with built-in crypto? 
Let me offer a possible scenario: we're entering an era when
there is much more chip real-estate than "consumer-grade" PC's
can use. Adding an encryption engine to the instruction stream
could be as simple as adding a series of barrel shifters between
(or inside) the processor cache and the instruction decoder.
(Imagine blowfish or DES -- or something as simple as RC4).
If encryption is turned off, the chip would be bug-for-bug
compatible with the existing PC. The vendor would put the
chip into the ordinary production cycle and, in two to
three years, it would be on the target audience's desktops.
(Remember, it would run existing and new, non-encrypted,
software without change.)
Encryption would be turned on on a module-by-module basis by
operating system "loader" code that would detect a "key required"
cookie in the executable file (or the Open Doc file, or
the Java class file). Before starting the module, the
o.s. loader would lookup the cookie and load the decryption
key into the chip. The customer would purchase a key by
giving a magic number from the software and a magic number
(processor serial number) to the vendor. This could be
done automatically over the network.
Now, a software vendor could provide the latest software for
free from a public FTP site, and could offer a variety of
decryption keys (30 day free trial, one-time-use micropayment,
etc.) at a variety of prices. This could also be integrated
into multiple site-license managers such as KeyServer.
As with KeyServer, key management could be done "invisibly"
over the Internet.
Note that the chip does not offer end users any encryption
or decryption capabilities -- the decrypted instruction
stream cannot be directly examined by end users. On the
other hand, if the encryption key generator was available
to "anybody," it would be trivial to construct secret
messages by generating programs that, when run, constructed
the desired message. For that reason, I suspect that
keys will be limited to a length that "national interests"
are comfortable with.

An article in today's (Tue, Nov 19, 1996) New York Times described
how British intelligence had early information of the slaughter of
European Jewery through the decryption of German radio messages.
(Although not noted in the article, this is presumably Ultra
decryption of Enigma).
The information was not acted upon, and the article offers
a number of reasons, among which was a (not unreasonable) fear that
doing so would compromise Ultra. The article also notes that
the decryptions were kept so secret that the information was
not available at post-WW2 war crimes trials (such as Nurenburg).
I suppose that this could offer a counter argument to the NSA FUD
"If you only knew what we know."

@_subject: Digital Footprints (Article in UK Guardian) 
The online edition of the UK Guardian newspaper has a long
article on the way that "Internet users leave traces and records
of every online action, from sending e-mail or posting to
newsgroups to visiting Web sites."
... "At the moment unwanted e-mail is about the limit of the
intrusion, but this could change. Internet commentator Dominique
Paul Noth points out: "You have no guarantee that the information is
intelligently or even accurately employed to your benefit." As more
information is collected, it is more useful to those collecting it
- and less easily controlled."
... One alternative is making yourself anonymous by deleting cookie
files and using mail programs that disguise your identity."
"However, making yourself anonymous online means that you cannot
personalise Web pages, ask for information via e-mail, or join
mailing lists. The issue, as Noth and other commentators recognise,
is more to do with how this information is used. Credit card companies
know what we are buying, and there is a legal framework to control
their use of this information. There is no such framework in force
for online information. "It seems that the very lack of "real world" controls over online
activity which many Internet users favour has created the environment
in which marketing companies can thrive. As long as the Internet
is seen as somehow outside the reach of the law, then there will be
those who abuse its freedom. So as you surf for Christmas presents,
look out for surprises in your mailbox as a result"

Two minor points:
First, Ebonics (Black English) is grammatical, but its grammar differs
from that of standard American English.
Second, from what I heard on the news, Oakland wants to call it a
separate language because they discovered that they got better results
teaching standard English to Black students if they used secondary
language techniques, as opposed to treating Black English constructions
as "wrong" or "inferior."

You'll find an article worth a visit to the dentist in the January
1997 issue of Popular Science. It tells a story from the 1960's
cold war era.
It seems that the only American who could get into the Soviet
Embassy was the Xerox repairman. So the CIA and Xerox built
a camera that took a picture of every copy that could be installed
inside the 914 cabinet (where it would be invisble). Once a month,
the repairman came by to do the ordinary cleaning and repair
(those things broke down a lot). Part of the repair process exchanged
the camera for a fresh load. The CIA could then read everything that
was copied.
The article suggests that other Xerox models had their own
cameras. My back of the envelope (literally) computation suggests
that one roll of 8-millimeter film would hold about 30,000 images.

To summarize, the Digital Video Disk standard contains an encryption

A solution may be in the offing within days. Some sources said late last
week that Matsushita [who owns license rights] and key U.S. computer
companies may resolve the software-licensing issues by the end of this

that would result in equivalent treatment of software- and hardware-based
CSS decryption.
... there apparently has been some speculation among the U.S. PC community
that Matsushita may be stonewalling on the software-licensing issue so that
it can establish its hardware-based decryption solution in the marketplace.
Nothing in the article suggests that "national interests" are involved.

EEC countries forbidden for Swedish crypto-export.
The export control agreement that governs Sweden's export of sensitive
high-technology even stops sale of encryption software to several
EEC countries. Security-political considerations from cold war days
are a serious barrier for integration in the EEC.
In international regulation of high-technology commerce, crytographic
equipment and crypto-software is either directly considered "war material"
or counted as dual-use products -- i.e. products with both civil and
military use. Twenty-eight industrial countries, including Sweden, stand
behind the rules ... called "Wassenaar Agreement" after the suburb
to Den Haag in the Netherlands where they were written.
... The Wassenaar Agreement is a continuation of COCOM (the West's
embargo of high-technology to the Eastern block). After COCOM was lifted
in 1993, there were discussions about what should be included in
future controls. The USA, for example, would not accept Russian
involvement while Russia exported weapons to Iran. Eventually, Russia
and the other Eastern-Bloc countries accepted Wassenaar [this is
probably a poor translation] and, today, 33 states are partners in the
agreement, including even South Korea, Bulgaria, and Turkey.
... Encryption equipment is included in the group "information security"
in the goods-list and regulations that control Swedish high-tech export.
(SFS 1994:2060, lastest revision December 1996). [SFS is the national
registry of all Swedish laws, proclamations, and similar.] This control
includes essentially all digital encryption systems. Export may not take
place without approval of the "Inspectorate for Strategic Products" (ISP)
at the Foreign Office.
Following the rules, a Swedish resident would break the law by carrying
a portable computer with a "trivial encryption program (that is not
commercially available)" on the ferry boat across Oresund to Denmark
without a specific export license! A bank ATM card with an encrypted
password can be carried, but not a "smarter" bank or ID card.
While licenses are available, they require special testing. The product
must be "strength-classified" which, in complicated cases, would be done
by the the Defense Radio Service (FRA) [the Swedish equivalent to NSA].
Also, the destination land and the importer's technical knowledge will
also be examined closely.
For Swedish exporters to Europe, this is often experienced as a
"terrorising bureaucracy." ''We who are major exporters of encryption
equipment to telephone [service] operators in, for example, Germany,
must let every delivery be individually examined by ISP despite the fact
that the same products are often repeated,'' says Haakan Persson at
Swedish AU-system. The explanation is that not every EU land fulfills
the Wassanaar requirements.
The point of the rules, explains Egon Svensson at ISP, is that we do
not spread advanced technology to countries that have not had it previously.
Thus, certain countries are excluded. For encryption equipment, only
England, France, Holland, Sweden, Germany, and perhaps a few others, are
considered to have sufficicent capacity and knowledge to be recipient
countries. They say that the restrictions within EU are temporary, but
there is no immediate sign that they will be eased.

To summarize, the Digital Video Disk standard contains an encryption
standard for copyright and anti-piracy protection. however, "some U.S.
PC and silicon vendors have just about abandoned hope of keeping to
their revised launch schedules for DVD-enabled systems."
... as far as anybody knows, "none of the U.S. PC vendors today has a license
to use the DVD-decryption algorithm" in software.
"We all know the situation; we don't have a license," said Michael
Moradzadeh, program manager of Intel's copy-protection task force.
A solution may be in the offing within days. Some sources said late last
week that Matsushita [who owns license rights] and key U.S. computer
companies may resolve the software-licensing issues by the end of this
week. The PC industry seeks amendments to the licensing-agreement language
that would result in equivalent treatment of software- and hardware-based
CSS decryption.
... there apparently has been some speculation among the U.S. PC community
that Matsushita may be stonewalling on the software-licensing issue so that
it can establish its hardware-based decryption solution in the marketplace.
Nothing in the article suggests that "national interests" are involved.

According to an article in the Swedish newspaper, Svenska Dagbladet
the Stockholm narcotics police has asked the national police and
State Prosecutor to require that purchasers of a new telephone
card used for mobile telephones be registered, and that the police
have access to the purchaser database. "Since the card is purchased
anonymously, the owner cannot be determined, which makes wiretapping
impossible." The new card is pre-paid with 250 or 550 kroner (very
roughly $32 or $70) air time and a telephone number, but does not
require any other subscription. The card can be used on an ordinary
GSM mobile telephone "which can be borrowed or stolen" and can be
re-loaded when the air time runs out.
A similar card is in use in France. However, the French security
service made the government force the telephone company to require
that purchasers show an id card when tbey purchase the card.

@_subject: Notes from the Cypherpunks September Bay Area Meeting 
Here are some notes I took at the Cypherpunks September Bay Area Meeting
on September 13 at "PGP World Headquarters" in San Mateo. Quotes are
summaries and interpretations, but hopefullfy fair and accurate.
My interpolations enclosed in square brackets.
Cypherpunks meetings are not particularly formal, but more like a
dialog between a number of people, punctuated with slightly more
formal presentations.
Introductory discussion of the recent crypto-gutting legislative
Eric Hughes (EH): This is the fifth anniversary of Cypherpunks. At
the first meeting, we demonstrated a number of the technologies that
are now becoming widespread, including remailers, and breaking weak
(i.e., exportable) cryphograph.
Tim May (Tim): What we feared five years ago is worse than Clipper --
it's an absolute disaster. The government has declared war on privacy.
The only survivor is likely to be Trusted Information Systems, which
has very close connection to the NSA.
EH: The government now desires access to all plaintext communication.
Tim: The British, and OECD, trusted third party proposal is a nightmare:
even if you have access to software such as PGP and Explorer that provides
strong privacy, the British now regard the keys you need to use that
technology as "crypto material" -- and it will be illegal to distribute
unbreakable keys [presumably without license or escrow capabilities].
Vinnie Moscaritalo (Vinnie): Black market?
EH: No: there will be an underground market [the distinction is important]
what we need are legitimate distribution of keys and crypto. Social pressure
will otherwise keep crypto unused.
Tim: Quoting Whitfield Diffie: this is like the war on drugs. Ban grypto
and companies will dpeutize themselves to assist the government just
as they did by requiring urine tests.
EH: [The computer industry is moving to] remote policy enforcement --
copyright enforcement [to prevent you from using software if you
don't have a license to it, or to prevent you from viewing a
copy of a movie]. The same mechanisms can be used to enforce crypto
You can characterize GAK/ATP (Government access to keys, access to
plaintext) as possession with the intent to communicate.
Tim: The intelligence community wants to be your supplier of big-brother
crypto. They are not fascists; they just don't have a clue. Intel's
next [next plus one?] generation processors will devote 3-4% of
their chip area to functions that facilitate encryption. All processors
will be serial-numbered. [This makes it very simple to "seal" a
program so it can only be used on a single, specific, processor. This
capability has been used for a decade in the minicomputer world.]
Tim/EH: The battle must be fought in [the context of] the First
Amendment. Qooting Don Hayes: "Nothing good can come out of crypto."
[I think Hayes was referring to crypto legislation.]
Jeremy of Blue Money Software briefly described their electronic
cash programming interface.
Someone (Jeremey?) described an "onion routing" electronic mail
protocol that conceals all information. This lets two people
communicate without any external party either reading the mail or
determining the sender or receiver. This was developed by the U.S.
Naval Research Laboratories. They need ths because they otherwise
cannot conceal sensitive communications within public traffic.
Kelly Blough, PGP's Government Relations representative discussed
the recent legislation initiatives.
The Pro Code bill is dead. Stuck in a senate committee.
The McCane Kerry bill passed commerce, but was not reported out:
McCain doesn't like it. This is good news.
The SAFE bill (in the House) passed the [which?] committee in a way
that we like. The bill removes export control on public code. It
allows Americans full access to strong crypo. It was referred to
National Security, Commerce, and [International Relations?] committees.
National Security gutted the bill. Intelligence added FBI-requested
access to plaintext. This was done in an unusual closed-door markup.
[These are usually only done for military and intelligence funding
bills.] "The intelligence community wants to set policy."
Dave Del Torto (DDT): A friend says that the military intelligence
personnell are swarming on the Hill.
Kelly: thinks that this is mostly driven by domestic law enforcement,
not the military
Commerce added a gutting amendment, but now waiting two weeks.
Tim: Declan McCullogh said that Louis Freeh said that, if a
Congressman votes against gutting crypto, the FBI will blame the
next Oklahoma City bombing on that Congressman.
Kelly: This is good in one way: the cards are now on the table. The
regional telephone companies, auto manufacturers, are all on PGP's
side: "How can we help?" Banks and other financial institutions are
not on PGP's side: because of the export exception.. Maybe this will
change when the impact of domestic restrictions sink in.
John Gilmore (JohnG): sens a fax to his respresentative, Nancy Pelosi.
Asked whether this law should be passed without review. Her chief
of staff replied that Pelosi brought up issues, but didn't change
the consensus. Also brought up the lack of law enforcement tracking
and notification. Tom Lantos, who sits on both the National Security
and International Relations committees (and who is the representative
for PGP's district) -- for someone who is strong on on human rights,
he is voting against strong crypto.
Tim: Why does PGP participate in export committees.
Kelly: Industry group to lobby: Microsoft, etc. Big companies: trying
to demonstrate that it's not just software.
DDT: Electronic Freedom Foundation?
JohnG: We got out of lobbying. Focussing on the Bernstein appeal. John
is talking to Pelosi individually. She will write a minority report
of disagreement with the National Security committee decision.
EH: PGP needs support from cypherpunks.
Kelly: Lobbying media. Gutting crypto gives government access to reporters'
notes, to communication with anonymous sources. [Also lawyer, client.]
The SAFE bill will probably go to the floor as written. Amendments must
be voted upon. Pro Code is dead.
DDT: Political liability: Gore was thought to be a friend to Silicon
Valley -- maybe not now. But, maybe he doesn't think that Silicon
Valley helped Clinton in 1996.
JohnG: The "one time review" proposal lets "NSA read your source code"
Lets them find holes in your product. Pelosi's chief of staff said to
John that it will be illegal to sell strong crypto immediately after
the law passes. But distribution will be allowed until 2000. This was
put in for PGP: human rights workers are using it -- this will let
PGP spread around for three years.
Tim [?]: WIPO (world intellectual property agreement) will ban all forms
of code cracking. Pushed by content providers to secure their intellectual
Kelly, with PGP former president Tom Steddings, wrote the recent California
legislature resolution.
JohnG: Trusted Information Systems has three patents on key recovery.
EH: Why do the Fed's want access to plaintext? The motivation has not
been made clear. Policy goals are stated in technological terms, not
in policy terms.
Other notes (more technical)
Don't use a hardware black-box to generate private keys: they can
leak private key information in the public key. Use a mix of software
and hardware: do final generation in auditable software.
Ian Goldberg: Move crypto to Palm Pilot. Demonstarted secure e-mail
and web browsing on a Palm Pilot connected (through a bizarre collection
of cables) to a Metricom radio modem.
Dave Lainer [??] discussed cell phone privacy. There are three kinds
of information that needs to be secured: the voice message, the number
that you are calling, and the cell-phone identification. None of
this is secure on analog phones. The phone companies don't care about
user privacy: only about call setup privacy. NSA lied to telecom
committees about call security. Voice privacy is trivial.
PGP is trying to get their PGP phone technology into digital cell phones.
This can do end-to-end encryption between PDP-enhanced phones.
There are several kinds of information that need to be secured:
voice, billing information, dialed numbers, and the caller's physical
location.  The government likes secure billing information -- if they
don't know who made the call, they can't use it as evidence against
an accused.
JohnG: the cell phone authentication algorithm was recently cracked.
EH: New Japanese phenonemon: tiny PKS cell phones. Teen-agers (who are
driving lifestyle changes) all use them.
DDT: Discussed Open PGP: a non-proprietary standard presented to
IETF: This includes a public-key infrastructure, trust model, message
format, MIME (content format), and meta-certificate technology.
Proposed to the Vatican (Papal representatives must communicate
with Rome). Big battle in Rome between Netscape and Microsoft
to be the "official browser of the Vatican." Big is an underestimate:
Microsoft is offerring "eternal" licenses.

Anonymous, signing as Monty Cantsin, Editor in Chief of Smile Magazine
quotes my Cypherpunks summary's quote of Eric Hughes:
Sorry, it isn't obvious to me. The most paranoid I can work myself
up to is to assume that some (not all) of our leaders want to restore
their half-remembered 1950's Dick-and-Jane, big car, Eisenhauer suburbian
childhood; and are afraid that letting absolute privacy loose will
be the end-of-civilization-as-we-know-it. This parallels the battles
that were waged in the early 1960's, as the civil rights movement
(and the Pill) shattered the myth of suburbia. The police and FBI
felt, quite sincerely, that they were in the midst of a revolution
and had to take "necessary measures" to save America.
The new cryptography makes the Internet safe for child pornographers,
for revolutionaries, for criminals, as well as for human rights
workers, for religious missionaries in unfriendly countries, and
multinational corporations. The message I read from the attempt
to criminalize strong cryptography is that the risk of damage
from the pornographers (etc.) is so great that we must restrict
cryptography and trust the national leadership to respect the
rights of the good guys. Unfortunately, one country's human
rights worker is another country's dangerous revolutionary.
Remember, the Martin Luther King who was thrown in jail in Alabama
in the early 1960's was the same Martin Luther Kings who received
the Nobel Peace Prize a few years later, and who was killed for
his revolutionary activities just a few years after that. Whether
he was a hero or villian depends on who writes the history book
and it is, ultimately, our responsibility to make sure that many,
conflicting, history books can be written.

I would say that a "cryptographic product" is any [insert patent
lawyer language here] that can be used to encrypt or decrypt a
message, and a "key" (the thing you escrow) is the mechanism
by which a message is converted between plaintext and encrypted
text. (Note, then, that I am including both halves of a public
key pair.)
By this, admittedly devil's advocate, reasoning, the sender would
have to escrow the actual session key, not just the private
key that the receiver uses to recover the session key. After all,
if you use PGP to encrypt a message using a public key -- and
don't possess the corresponding private key -- you couldn't read
your own message, but my reading of the law is that the
government still must have immediate access to the plaintext.

the information posted material, you wouldn't want to give to a provider,
(considering) "http post/put" is normally spoofable anyway.
Unanswered question for next time - or for folks with more time than me to
follow up Can you put other sites in your channel definition and get logs
of when they read your competitor's site (with this system)?
Definitely not confidence-inspiring. It appears the Mac version is affected
by this same problem, as well...and neither platform has any means of
disabling this "feature" at present.
[Internet Explorer 4.0 has not yet been released for the Macintosh platform.]

@_subject: New PGP "Everything the FBI ever dreamed of" 
An article in today's (Fri, Oct 3) New York Times (CyberTimes)
describes the new release of "PGP for Business Security 5.5," which
contains mechanisms that incorporate key recovery mechanism that can either
be volontary or be enforced by using PGP's software for controlling a
company's SMTP server -- the server can verify that all encrypted messages
include the corporate public key (or conform to other corporate policies):
"The new version also includes some of the most sophisticated techniques
for enforcing this policy through the corporation. The most novel may be a
new version of software controlling a company's SMTP server, the machine
that acts as the central mailroom for a corporation. PGP provides a
software agent that will read all of the mail to make sure that it complies
with the corporate policy. This may include requiring all messages to be
signed with digital signatures or include a backdoor that the management
can use to read the message. If the software agent discovers a message
violates the policy, it can either return it to sender or simply log a copy.
"PGP implements the backdoor with a central key. Each message is  encrypted
with both the public key of the recipient and the public key of the
management. The message can only be read by someone holding the
corresponding private keys, in this case the recipient and the management.
The software allows the management to use different master keys for
different departments by customizing the software.
... "Bruce Schneier, an encryption expert and author of the popular book
Applied Cryptography, said that the new announcement "sounds like
everything the FBI ever dreamed of." He also predicts that criminals will
find ways to circumvent the restrictions while honest people may be more
vulnerable to illicit use of the master key."
Coincidently, the same issue of the New York Times has an editorial
 attacking
FBI director Louis Freeh's request that Congress "outlaw the
manufacture and distribution of encryption programs the Government cannot
instantly crack.

@_subject: Re: What's really in PGP 5.5? 
Anonymous, claiming to be Monty Cantsin, writes about PGP 5.5:
No, it isn't "just like Clipper." Messages encrypted with PGP 5.5
can be decrypted or verified by PGP 5.0 or other implementations that
can decode the PGP message and encryption format. Also, PGP 5.0 or other
complient implementations can send encrypted and signed messages to
PGP 5.5 users.
The transmitted message is as "weak" as the quality of the encryption,
the number of people who have access to the secret key, and the
quality of their passwords. It is also as "weak" as the physical
security that prevents passwords from leaking (i.e., by Tempest
or black bag wiretaps inside the secure user's workstation).
Given all of the other risks, encrypting to a corporate private
key doesn't seem to me to significantly increase the risk.
The real risk, to my view, is that some future implementation will
require the secondary key, and will require that that secondary
key be stored in a "government accessable" database. This, however,
seems a bit remote and, given that PGP publishes their source code,
reasonably easy to detect.

@_subject: Swedish policy paper on key/message escrow 
Today's "Svenska Dagbladet" has an article on a policy paper released
by the Swedish Foreign Office that follows the American agenda. "Only
simple encryption that is easy to decypher should be sold outside the
country without restriction." Also, "it is required that capability
is created for legal access to clear-text or keys." (My ugly, but
precise, translation from the article's quote from the report.)
The report authors suggest a complicated structure with key depositories,
"preferably privately owned" that "can be granted control over all
of the encryption keys that are used on the Internet." Police and
proscecutors can obtain these encryption keys as needed to access
secret documents.
The report has been widely criticized.

Not really; at its core, Chomsky's theory is a claim that every
human can learn any human language -- something that 2-year old
infants prove every day. I.e., nothing in language is specific
to any particular human social or racial group: the differences
are learned.  There is a fair body of research that indicates
that, after (roughly) puberty, humans do not learn foreign
languages in the same way that infants learn their first language;
but rather overlay the new language on top of their existing
The code talkers used a variety of puns and allegorical metaphors
to hide the underlying meaning from someone who could translate
Navaho but lacked the overall shared culture of the Navaho sailors.
During the 1940's, only a handful of non-Navaho (generally linguists)
were fluent in the language (probably less than two dozen).
Incidently, in a recent episode of the South Bronx tv series, a crime
was solved because a black policeman was fluent in Japanese.

@_subject: Encryption without encryption - from Ron Rivest 
In a paper entitled "Chaffing and Winnowing: Confidentiality without
Encryption," Ron Rivest describes a method of transmitting a document
that gives an evesdropper no information about the content of the
document. "Winnowing does not employ encryption, and so does not have a``decryption key.''  Thus, the usual arguments in favor of ``keyrecovery'' don't apply very well for winnowing.  As usual, the policydebate about regulating technology ends up being obsoleted bytechnological innovations.  Trying to regulate confidentiality byregulating encryption closes one door and leaves two open(steganography and winnowing)."
