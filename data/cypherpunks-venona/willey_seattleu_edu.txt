jmd, asked me to forward this to the list, i think, i was testing his
procmail recipe and all that was ever seen of his most recent message was

According to steve willey:
I'm using v2.91.  I don't think you will have a prob. tho.  Let me know.  Send
yourself a few messages.  You need to send a key, a signed message, and an
encrypted message.  You also might want to try the requests.  Hope you like it.
