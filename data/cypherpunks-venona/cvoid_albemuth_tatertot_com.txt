For a moment there, yes. But alas, I have the problem fixed. You see,
I was gating the list into a local group for my own purposes, and was not aware my machine (albemuth) was batching the list outgoing. My smarthost asked about this as it was being junked on his end. Well evidently, the
junking stopped and alas  starting showing up on Netcom. The problem is corrected. Sorry if anyone is upset, but alas, shit happens. ;)

I will be sorting through the t-shirt requests and compiling a list. It will be done in a few days. As soon as I finish this, I will mail everyone on the list, and we can start hashing out a design. I have a screening company I work with, and am currently working out the details with them. Any questions can be directed to me at  or . Thanks.

@_subject: T-SHIRT UPDATE #2 
Greetings. Sorry for the delay, I hope you all had a wonderful holiday.
We are finishing up the t-shirt design, and it will soon be made available for approval in it's entirity. The plan is to have people order before the end of January (February 1st being the cutoff), and have the shirts shipped out in the first week of February. We are doing only as many shirts as we get orders for, hence the mass mailing.
I will be posting an update in the next few days with information on the preview files and ordering information.
The t-shirts will cost approximately $10 each, and will include shipping, etc. All additional information will be posted in the next update...
We are only doing one mass run of this design, so it will not be made available again in the future.
If anyone has any questions or comments please mail me. Thanks.
