@_subject: Help Needed: PGP SIGNED MESSAGE 
Please excuse the interruption.  I'm having problems signing
a text message with my secret key and creating output that leaves
the text message as is but with an ascii signature at the bottom.  Or rather, I don't want the message encrypted, I just want the nifty sig
attached and email-able. I've done this before using some combination of -sat or something similar
but I have since forgotten.  This is a rather embarrassing question, I
know it has to be a simple switch in the syntax but I spent 2 hours last
night and 1 hour this morning trying to figure the damn thing out... learned a few interesting things along the way.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please reply to me rather than
the list.  Thank you, -z (kevink)

@_subject: key management workshop 
I'm interested in starting a key management workshop for the purpose of
learning more about how to properly manage keys, the use of anon
remailers, hopping mail, and pgp in general.  I would appreciate copies of your public key if you are interested in
participating.  Please keep in mind this exersise is for EXPERIMENTAL PURPOSES ONLY.  I'm
running pgp on a shared system, therefore the security here is not fully
tamperproof (ie. passwords can be picked up on the line from this local
machine to the remote site). If you would rather submit a "test" key,
please do so. I would like to know if anyone on either list has objections to using the
cypherpunks and/or austin-cypherpunks list as
places of exchange of group messages.  One last thing; any information on the format for hopping mail through
encryption supported remailers would be appreciated.  I look forward to your support and participation.  Thank you,
- -z
