I'd like to explore the technical problems of enforcing copyright restrictions through encryption and custom viewing software.
What I have in mind is a viewer, say a spin off of Mosaic, that has
a general purpose decryption engine that could be programmed with an
algorythm as part of the document download process.  The goal I have
in mind is to make possible one time, or limited time viewing of a
downloaded document  The document would be encrypted with the selected
method and keyed with a timestamp.  The client would need access to a
timeserver and a session key, etc. to decrypt as close as possible to
the display hardware.
This could be prototyped as a user process, but securely implemented
as an extension to X, MS-Windows, etc.
I haven't worked out all the problems, but see quite a few already.
Obviously, the goal would be to get really good copyright material on
the net, like first run movies, when we have the bandwidth.
Just wondering what minimum collection of hardware, software, and
infrastructure would be needed.  Of course, this is related to the
pay-per-use software paradigm (vs. current unlimited license).

@_subject: Re: Copyright enforcement through crypto 
Yesyes, you're preaching to the choir.  I want information to be free
too, etc.
It just occurred to me that by tying the decryption to a time server
and sending both the timebased key and a complete algorithm to a general purpose engine that you might get something somewhat effective.
To give an example:
12 years ago I worked in a computer store that sold Atari computers.
I learned to program on my Atari 400, cassete, Basic, assembly, etc.
I used to have fun 'breaking' the copy protection on game floppies.
There were some sophisticated methods that a number of companies used,
but I could eventually disassemble and follow the code and patch it.
(Blue Max was the hardest I cracked: 5 stage load, several
multi-sector-with-same-number-same-track protections, and executing
code merged from two such sectors).
The one disk that I couldn't crack (and I still have it) was the ABC
Basic compiler.  The compiler was compiled with itself.  Since the
assembly was just a general purpose engine, I had to follow the
p-code/tokenized Basic all over the place.  I could never keep track
of it long enough to solve it.
If an algorithm is only good for a perticular copy of a document and
only for a short time, the theoretical possibility of cracking it
becomes harder.
I want to explore what aspects can be solved and what can't.
Obviously you can always take a picture of the screen, possibly
capture data in the window/operating system, etc.  But, with
a modifed X, unmodified OS, etc., how close can you get.
Unless each document uses it's own key and randomly selected
algorithm(s) and needs online access.
Of course, that's always a problem, unless things are priced per use
so that it's more attractive to pay.
Of course, I didn't say it was necessary...  Just musing how effective
it would be.
I agree.
Come on guys, I don't post that much, but you need to crank up your
Devil's Advocate detectors.  Geesh, doesn't anyone like a good

CFS, like other specialized NFS servers, talks to NFS clients like
the normal NFS server, but runs on a different RPC port (so you can
run several types of NFS servers).  CFS encrypts directories that can be attached and detached without changing the NFS mount.
It occurred to me that it wouldn't be too tough to have one CFSD
open a TCP/socket connection to another CFSD and pass file access
requests instead of implementing them locally.  The encryption
of the ssh link and the on disk encryption of CFSD should be a good combination.
I've been compiling under Linux and have had a number of autoconfiguration
errors.  I'll produce a simple-minded patch shortly.
(Thinks I'm cross-compiling, have some include files I don't, don't
have waitpid/wait3, collision with stdc crypt/random defs, etc.)

That's true.  I was thinking in terms of traversing firewalls in a
safe fashion rather than where normal SUN/RPC NFS is available.
For this, using CFS and SSH together seems appropriate.

IANAL, but I find this position to be stretching the limits of

other forms of lost income.  If you collected a fee for a usage that
was identical in function to one that actually took place, (or even

they include DES capability.  The fully ISDN 2864I without/with NT-1
retails for $699/$749.  Only the I model (with built-in complete ISDN)
supports DES according to the data sheet.
2864 retails for $549 and they have a non-ISDN modem even cheaper.
They support almost every conceivable feature, including ISDN on both
B channels, ISDN on one with analog conversion on the other, and
built-in microphone and speaker jacks to better support voice
capability. (The 1496E's could be used as voice mail systems, etc.)

*** Help on ENCRYPT
Usage: ENCRYPT [| []]
  ENCRYPT allows you to hold an encrypted conversations with
  a person or a whole channel.  Once a nickname/channel and
  key is specified, all messages you send to that
  nickname/channel will automatically be encrypted using the
  given key.  Likewise, any messages from that nickname/channel
  will automatically be decrypted. ircII is smart enough to know
  if the incoming message isn't encrypted and will not attempt to
  decrypt it.  If you received an encrypted message from someone
  for whom you haven't specified a key, it will be displayed as
  [ENCRYPTED MESSAGE].
  The  can be any text which is to be used an they key
  for encryption/decryption of the conversation.  It is up to
  you and the people you wish to talk to about how to agree upon
  a key and how to communicate it to one another.
  For example, if user CheeseDog wishes to talk encryptedly with
  user DogCheese, they must first agree on an encryption key
  (case sensitive), say foo.  Then user CheeseDog must issue a
    ENCRYPT DogCheese foo
  and user DogCheese must issue a
    ENCRYPT CheeseDog foo
  Thereafter, all messages sent between CheeseDog and DogCheese
  will be encrypted and decrypted automatically.
  If ENCRYPT is given with a nickname but no key, then encrypted
  conversation is ended with that user.  If ENCRYPT is given with
  no arguments, the list of encrypted user and keys are
  displayed.
  IrcII uses a built in encryption method that isn't terribly secure.
  You can use another if you so choose, see SEE ENCRYPT_PROGRAM
  for information about this.
  If you are sending encrypted messages to a user or channel, you
  can toggle it off and on in a message line by inserting the
  control-E character in the input line.  This is usually done
  by hitting control-Q then control-E.  An inverse video E will
  appear in the input line.
  Control-q is bound (see BIND) to quote_character by default.
  It is frequently necessary to change this to some other char.
See Also:
  SET ENCRYPT_PROGRAM
*** You have new email.
*** No help available on encrypt_program: Use ? for list of topics
*** Help on ENCRYPT_PROGRAM
Usage: SET ENCRYPT_PROGRAM   Sets the program used to encrypt and decrypt messages.  The
  program selected must take an encryption key as the first
  command line argument to work with IRCII.

I would like some summary opinions of the state of various efforts to
enable full IP encryption.  I'm looking for progress reports and hints
as to which technologies are the closest to being implementable.
After playing with ssh, I've been thinking of what it would take to
start migrating certain links to full encryption, possibly using a
VPN-like arrangement.
I'm interested in hacking Linux, loopback userspace drivers for other Unix's,
and thinking about what would need to be done for MS-BLECH.  Of course,
firewall like conversion of IP<->IPng6 would be great.
Of course now that Linux has IP aliasing, IP masquerading (partial I think),
ipfw, and IP over IP tunneling, it has much of what it needs.  I'm just
considering development and migration paths.
I haven't kept up on IPng6 docs, so succinct pointers would be helpful.
One interesting tact might be to start running a dual IPng6/IP stack
where it learns to tunnel packets over a well-known IP udp/tcp link
if an address doesn't respond to IPng6.

Not only that but it's common now for DNS servers to give short TTL
for the answers (multiple A recs for load balancing), no big deal
to have pseudo-subdomains that are pointed at a different server
(Even over slip/ppp) than normal name service.
I believe the root servers answers for intermediate nodes are cached
normally, so key.george.bub.com doesn't cause a root hit after
bub.com has been resolved.
Quite a few domains do run their own name servers, and it's not too tough
to create auto-update scripts, etc.
There's no reason that DNS has to be the only mechanism.  Default
to one method then fallback to others, like direct IP port connection
for query.

That's not necessarily true:
I could setup a web server to only listen to a socket that a local ssh
socket proxy could connect to.  Restrict the ssh session for a particular
key to only allow connection to that one socket.  Then the connecting
party would need ssh running with socket proxy near(er) their client
system and the public key.
Assuming that you have a Unix workstation with audio listening software
or a nearby PC it would be easy to setup.
Internet/Web accessible RSA protected, session encrypted voice mail.
Now if someone would just port ssh to the PC as a selective Winsock

I have a neighbor that develops one of the commercial TCP/IP stacks, so
it's quite possible I could convince him to help.
With things like ssh, it's already very easy to create secure tunnels.
It wouldn't be too tough to modify a proxy to use ssh style connections
if an initial connection was found to be encrypted (or a key was cached
for a URL).
