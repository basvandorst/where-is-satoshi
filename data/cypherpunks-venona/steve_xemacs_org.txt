I did, to an address I haven't used in months.  They confiscated all
his equipment perhaps they made the list from addresses they found
there ...

It would be an *extraordinarily* good forgery.  Everything checks out.

I didn't get a personal copy of the first one, hence my assumption
that the addresses were pulled off of Jim's confiscated equipment.

If those headers are forged, it is an expert forgery.
The MX hosts for the net.insp.irs.gov domain are fun:
net.insp.irs.gov        preference = 10, mail exchanger = tcs-gateway2.treas.gov
net.insp.irs.gov        preference = 20, mail exchanger = tcs-gateway1.treas.gov
net.insp.irs.gov        preference = 30, mail exchanger = gotcha.treas.gov
irs.gov nameserver = gotcha.treas.gov
irs.gov nameserver = nis.ans.net
irs.gov nameserver = ns.ans.net
tcs-gateway2.treas.gov  internet address = 204.151.246.2
tcs-gateway1.treas.gov  internet address = 204.151.245.2
gotcha.treas.gov        internet address = 204.151.246.80
`gotcha.treas.gov'?  It's a real host connected through ans.net ...

Except for hop 16, this is the same traceroute as to
tcs-gateway2.treas.gov.  For what it's worth, the traceroute to
tcs-gateway1 is slightly different:

@_subject: Re: Any talk of limiting _existing_ crypto? 
Indeed.  How about existing software with decades of previous
existence that has hooks where crypto can be plugged in with fairly
trivial effort?
We (the XEmacs developers, but I write only for myself as XEmacs
maintainer) already distribute mailcrypt (Emacs lisp code to
integrate PGP with mailers and newsreaders implemented in Emacs
lisp).  It has been possible to integrate encrypted editing with
encryption of the user's choice transparently for some time.
I agree.  An Emacs-like architecture makes implementing something like this pretty straight-forward.

Something is seriously wrong with the ifi.uio.no server.  You can't get
much of anything off of it.  I doubt the general outage is pgp related,
this isn't the first time there have been problems with it.

It's not the government's money.

Unix *is* far better and had the technology decades ago.
I don't agree with the US DOJ proceedings, but tell me why I have
disks full of software for my video card (amply covered by XFree86),
my sound card (amply covered by Linux drivers and Free utilities),
etc. etc. that I cannot use?
I danced through hoops to specifically avoid buying anything Microsoft and I still got stuck with a bunch of crap I won't ever use.
Where can I get a laptop without a pre-installed O/S (or with Linux
pre-installed) on it?
I think Microsoft is guilty as sin for monopolistic practices, but not
for what they're being charged for (unfortunately).
