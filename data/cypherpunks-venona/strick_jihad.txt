% | see if the password is in it.  My question is, are there any pre-built lists of
% | this nature?  I am currently only using a spelling dictoinary, and would like
% | somthing a little bigger.
I made one really easily once with a tiny awk program that read files
and remembered all the words (in a big table, with the old
``table[word]=1'' trick, then iterate the table and print it out).  I probably used 'tr -cd' in front of it to get rid of non-alfa stuff.
I fed it netnews -- especially hierachries with folklore, unix,
rec.all, sex, etc.   And it made a dictionary that cracked several
hundred passwords (from a Major University /etc/passwd) in about 24
hours of SparcStation II time (i think ... this was six years ago).
I remember finding the word 'creat' -- doubtless obtained from the unix
wizards group -- and a whole family of machine-generated accounts whose
password was 'pw'.  I'm not sure these words exist in dictionaries, but
they do in netnews and passwords.
anyway -- it's fun to make your own.

TCL solved my specific problem at that time.  Unfortunately I haven't
studied Java.  PM's comments (as usual) intrigue and bother me; I
need to study it.
TCL's biggest problem is that it's slow -- it's designed to be used
in the parts where speed doesn't really matter -- and it sounds
like java sovles that. Perry -- do you have the same basic objection to Safe-TCL that you do
do to Java?  I would think so.

Tim, a friend comments that if you're serious about getting
reports this way, you should contact one of the human rights
groups (Amnesty International, Article 19...) that gathers
reports which are generally believed to be accurate under
much more threatening situations.
I thought it a good comment.  I've worked for amnesty before,
and know of their reputation, but now how they attained it...
