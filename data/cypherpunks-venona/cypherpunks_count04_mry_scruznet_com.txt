    BZZT!!! wrong answer since 1981 on december 4  when president reagan
signed it into Executive Order   TLA's(those intelligence
agencies having strictly offshore charters CIA,NSA others) have been permitted
to operate domestically in cases of National Security(or involvement with persons suspected of being agents for foreign entities) and Drug War issues.
Formerly it was simply illegal but since the intel community had taken
such a hard hit during the church subcommittee hearings of the 1970's
the new tactic was to acquire legitimacy for black ops on domestic fronts
thus the above EO was shoved under reagans nose quickly...
The reference to the above EO may be found in the "CIA off Campus" booklet
by the Bill of Rights Foundation on page 134-135
ISBN 0-89608-404-3 (c) 1991 by Amy Chen Mills and the Bill of Rights
Get it its a fascinating read!!..
   cheers

@_subject: Re: Voice Stress Analysis of Debates? 
PSE/VSE etc relys  on a random 8-14 hz fm modulation appearing in the
 the 3rd formant band of the voice... the Dektor PSE retailed for approximately 5k in the early 1970's the hagoth hs-2 was the early 80;s for 2k .. I bought 2 VSE units based on a new chip for 89.95 apiece recently...
this was on an article appearing in popular electronics in 1995
no software as of yet and it would be probably a FFT or DFT based algorithm running on a sound blaster DSP(hardware DSP only) or as software
 on a fast 150 Mhz + pentium I can give the basic facts known... it is a truth
detector only(not a lie detector), background music shows up a stress...
and scrubbing the modulation shows up as constant stress or "possible decption"
truth is indicated by the modualtion showing up randomly over small increments
of time... the effect is caused by microscopic tremors of the larynx when the speaker is relaxed and truthful the larnyx is relaxed and the random modulations
show up,(or the speaker believes what he is saying to be the truth, when lying
or under stress the larybx tightens and the random modulations
disappear indicating stress... it would be  nice to have it in software...
to run on a laptop soundboard and spread to the net as widely as pgp...

Sigh... Yes Cypherpunks is indeed a private list...
yes John is entitled to refuse to have a guest in his
virtual home, and yet some denizens of this list
cant seem to accept that and scream and rant and rave about it..
What dont they understand about the word no? and WHY cant these holier than thou "anti-censorship" groupies
simply accept that John has made a choice,
it is his choice to make, and unless I miss my guess about John
(having known him for a few years now) there probably isnt any duress or
coercion that would have the least effect on his choice in fact
it would in the case of John reinforce his intransigent nature.
Perhaps if matters and the list are given a chance to quiet
feelings may change, further harassment of John on this
WONT help. As has been stated MANY times before.
if you dont like this forum go buy your own!

p.s. does anyone get it yet... we are ALL guests,
John does have the right to uninvite someone.

Hi Dimitri,
     depends on whether the binder in the glue is sticking or just
plain simply mud, if the documents are NOT fragile antiquities and
instead are modern photocopy paper and modern photographic papers
experiment in a very small area of the doc with freon tape cleaner
(it evaporates very rapidly) to try and free the areas of stickage
try other solvents also(this is how I cleaned a stack of crypto proceedings
that had been cat peed and stuck together), hope its going better for you..

  as to the budding facist comment
  I got death threats and called
traitor when I published PGP 1.0 and I endured
5 long years of federal harassment to listen to YOU???
   no I dont think so...
PLEASE consider this an official request to MODERATE the cypherpunks list
   kelly goen - Publisher PGP 1.0 June 5 1991
   now it seems not only a traitor but a budding facist...
BTW this account is being deleted tonite and I will gladly resubscribe
to a moderated list under a different name and host.domain than cypherpunk
