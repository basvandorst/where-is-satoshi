His was the most intelligent reply I've seen.  Why don't you answer
the question instead of evading it?  What is special about cryptography
that makes its use in a crime a Bad Thing, whereas the use of, say, a
toaster, is not?  Attempts to punish the tools instead of the crime
make as much sense and are as unsuccessful as treating an infection-caused
fever with aspirin instead of treating the infection itself.
