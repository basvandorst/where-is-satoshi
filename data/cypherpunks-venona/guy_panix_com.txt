It started out small: PICS, a simpleton rating language.
And "for a good cause": ideas about everyone needing
digital signatures to use the Net.
Then came Clive and others: let's expand PICS to be world-wide,
and start reporting items politically incorrect to the police.

Free speech advocate?
As long as it has been reviewed first.

: *   "Sure", said Al Bayse of the FBI, "I believe there is an absolute

: *   the law in a serious way. Any private conversation that doesn't

: *   In other words, as the debate was framed by Bayse, the right to
: *   privacy is at least partly contingent on a determination by an FBI

: *   understood do not involve a crime.
PICSRules takes it a step further: review all material,
report everything politically incorrect to the police,
allow each country to censor to its own tune.
An information infrastructure to do so.
It will make us long for the days of false hits by
current filtering programs, where a White House page
was censored because the word "couples" was on it.
Decrees will control what we see.
In Australia:
#   From: bobb (Bob Bain, re: PICSRules)
#   There are some here in Canberra who seem to view the Internet as an
#   extension of the "computer game" laws. There isn't a single computer
#   game that can be marketed in Australia which would be suitable for
#   adults - due to the fact that somebody in Canberra has decreed it.
Can't make an effect decree without a mechanism in place.
More on decrees later.

:   them around.
:   >The only stated purpose is to "protect" kids.
:   Right.
:   Suppose that there is a secret government plan for "mass global
:   censorship" of material...
Yes, let us suppose there is...what would be a good innocuous
name for it?
Oh, let's see, how about "Internet Watch Foundation"?
One big Evil Eye of Mordor, watching all.
Sorry, I'm ahead of myself...
It's all for a good cause, right?
   "Protect the children" ---Clive Feather
:   As for a "global rating system", the whole point
:   of PICSRules is to make one *less* needed.
Wrong: PICSRules will allow each country to censor to its own satisfaction.
By labeling all content far beyond the control even
keywords in the original document would give you.
You're not a censor of pornography?
#   From the Lapdance News Service (a division of ASSCnn)....12/1997
#   #   LONDON, ENGLAND -- Demon Internet, which claims to be Europe's
#   largest Internet service provider (ISP), has begun testing an
#   automated scanning system for Usenet pornography.
#   #   The system relies on data from the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF),
#   a UK association of ISPs, which has set up telephone and online
#   hotlines  for members of the public to advise on suspect Usenet
#   newsgroups and  Web addresses.
#   #   "The aim of this new system is to help streamline the process of
#   finding duplicated illegal material on the Internet and reduce the
#   number of abusers of the Internet by reporting and removing the
#   material that has been sent," he said.
#   "The software takes an MD5 format fingerprint of each sexually
#   explicit image that has been posted to the Usenet and has been removed
#   for legal reasons," he said, adding that, when the software spots the
#   same fingerprint anywhere else on the Internet, it alerts staff at the
#   ISP, so they can take appropriate action.
#   #   Plans call for the new software to be used in conjunction with the
#   IWF's program of identifying, reporting, and removing illegal material
#   from newsgroups.
#   #   The association is an independent organization to implement the
#   proposals jointly agreed by the government, the police...
Oh, my.
Clive Feather is a liar.
He is bending over backwards to give the government and the police
exactly what they want, just as if it had been legislated.
Clive's excuse: this way _newsgroups_ won't be dropped
by government decree.
Oh, big improvement, Clive.
The political whims of the moment will be accommodated.
This is quite different from user-local filtering,
or allocating just one bit for labeling everything
as "child-only" or not.
It's not close to something for merely providing user-level filtering.

#   ministers from Europe, United States, Canada, Russia and Japan at

#   filtering Internet content".
#   #   It is advocated in the EU's latest policy paper on
#   "Protection of Minors and Human Dignity in Audiovisual and
#   Information Services" and has been suggested as an alternative
#   approach to protecting children in the USA following the fall of

#   #   #   September 1997 statistics:

#    #   I'm somewhat disillusioned because two of my favorite newsgroups seem
#   to be plagued by a similar problem -- an increase in off-topic chatter.
#    #   This has gone to the point on one of the groups
#   where some people have actually adopted an OFF-TOPIC keyword and use it
#   in subject headers.
#    #   In a very recent discussion where I pointed out that this went against
#                                                        ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^
#   the very foundation of Usenet and that off-topic threads were 100% noise,
#   ^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^^^
#   a user that has been posting less than a year and a half (from Netcom)
#   patiently explained to me how she felt the main appeal of the newsgroup
#   was its diverse nature and that she found the off-topic threads
#   "invigorating."
#    #   So I guess my point is I wish there were some mechanism in place to
#   reinforce that newsgroups are focused discussion groups and not informal
#   chat rooms or coffee klatches.  People are not taking it to email the
#   way they tended to in the "good old days."
#    #   I was just talking about this with someone in email.  She described an

#   enough) Mike Godwin for posting off-topic.  She said Godwin's response
#           ^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^
#   was that rec.arts.books was not a place for talking about books per se,
#   but a place where 'bookish' people could get together and chat.
#   #   That pretty much sums up the point I was trying to make.

The Clive Feather person is emphatic only real child porn
is being deleted and reported to the police; he clarified
that the 1800 items listed for Sep 1997 are *total* for
the existence of IWF.
So, it's probably going to take me several weeks to
verify his claim.
I back off from my claim (based on his dialog) that
they are canceling mere nudity, for now.

My interest has blown over.
PICSRules is a political response to government pressure.
IWF immediately began watching for KiddiePorn and notifying
IWF member organizations (and police) about such posts.
Members are given the MD5 of the post to automatically
delete it when next seen, in addition to the first deletion.
The only thing "watch" organizations are good for is
spotting "controversial" material.
Demon/IWF's Clive Feather:
:     Some subscribers to IWF have asked to be notified of certain other
:     classes of material, since they *do* choose to censor and not carry
:     more than just material that is illegal to possess. Demon is not one
:     of these ISPs.
So, IWF supports labeling/spotting of controversial material
for the purposes of censorship, beyond what is illegal.
Thus, the IWF is not going to get anywhere with PICSRules.
No way in hell can they label all of the Net.
Usenet content is produced at a furious rate: it cannot be rated
until it has already expired off of most servers.
Rate WWW? Most are business: who cares about advertising/support?
Any page with a counter on it won't verify the MD5 taken when
it was "rated"...
PICSRules is a political prank on the politicians.
Kind of like The Jetsons was an educational show about the future.
What *is* happening are groups forming to censor material;
funded by governments...
#   #   The Internet Watch Foundation, has already submitted a funding
#   request to the European Commission.
#   "Whatever happens, we will carry on trying to get the funding
#   we need," Kerr said. "These things cost money, and we have not
#   got all the money we need", said David Kerr, chief executive
#   of the British-based Internet Watch Foundation
This will probably keep expanding; Germany IWF to zap Nazi logos,
Israel IWF to zap revisionist history, Muslim IWF to zap heresy, etc.

How about moving this list to encrypt its transmissions in
the recipient's public keys, just to begin encrypting Net traffic?
Obviously not to hide what is being said, but simply to start
moving communications into the encrypted realm.
That way, we'll build up the software tools for handling this,
and try to get other lists to do the same.
Maybe encourage all pro-crypto people to use it for all email to as
many other people they talk with as possible. (Adopt two others...)
Heh: a white-list to allow only encrypted messages through.
Encourage Senators to set up public keys.
In general, try to get the general flow of traffic encrypted,
even if PGP is "mundane" these days.
Solving the human factors problem of getting its use wide-spread
is _not_ a mundane problem. Encryption ain't gonna be that useful
if only a few in-the-know use it.

Just curious what your reaction would be to that ambiguous statement.
Having done DA support, I expect you are quite serious
about heading the other way to give users security
and anonymity. How do you justify both, since the
"bad guys" would benefit?
It's the other stuff: that you flit around (people posting "Where
are you Jalon Q. Zimmerman?"), that The Digital Society doesn't
have its own domain, but is hosted by some other company called
"OpenWorld", which has AOL contact addresses...
Who is Mark Frazier, who owns OpenWorld, how long has it been in
business, what is your relationship to them, what is your job
description? Is OpenWorld another startup that is going to go ?
The OpenWorld pages read like any other company BS, and you've
given yourself the lofty title "Director".
Yeah, and we have Sir Timothy May, Dr. Dim Vulvis, etc.
You're about 26, and full of hot air.
   You mean well. ;-)

It sounds like a procedural thing.
Something like there was a way to swipe cards and have the
system wrongly think it updated the card.
The city announced that every cardreader in the system
is going to be recalibrated, and this will cause problems
for "a few" existing cardholders.

"Polis" is an arcane Scandanavian (sic) word for "Police".
That's as creative as Ukranian-Romainian-Gypsie Vulis can do.
Vulis couldn't even hack it in Manhatten, and had to leave.
His brother, Michael, said the family disowns Dimitry as the asshole
of the family line.
Regarding emailing Vulis to show him some appreciation: as you can see
from the headers, he is so disliked that he needs to connect to the
Net using UUCP!
   HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
And so, he has to download his mail before filtering/reading it, and
domain 'dm.com' is MX wild-carded to accept all references.
So, wouldn't it be funny if people started signed _him_ up for
Eureka, Russian Jewish Singles dating, etc?
Also, simply sending him largish missives will tie up his
poor UUCP link. So, if it doesn't violate your local TOS,
I think all of us should let Dr. Dim hear about it until
he cleans up his act.

A subsequent news report said hackers were taking discarded
(single-use?) MetroCards and "reprogramming" them so they
would work again.
However, the description didn't sound like it was really hacking...
The MTA said only 6 fraudulent uses of this was happening per day,
and 40 of these total per day.
"Of these"?
The MTA said there was some limited tolerance for nicked or
scratched cards, and in this situation - where the software
guessed that it was a scratched card - that it was programmed
to be "lenient" and let them in.
The news report showed the MTA's new recommendation for carrying
MetroCards: sliding them into a protective container for travel.
The mag-strip cards suck.

Is this for a "cypherpunks" smartcard, or for hacking them?
Smartcards tend to be transponders, and to want to gobble up
all other cards...bad card, bad card.

And, yes, 'vznuri is a nym for Dr. Dim: just check

   Smart Cards Smarten the Net
   By Albert Pang
   For many contractors to the U.S. Department of Defense, the Internet
   will become an important ally this year, helping them resolve one of
   the most daunting challenges when doing business with the government:
   Getting paid on time and with a minimal amount of hassle.
   Thanks to a new breed of smart cards backed by sophisticated Web
   applications, 200 defense contractors will start receiving electronic
   checks (e-check) from the government via secure Internet e-mail
   through a pilot program launched in January 1998.    The contractors will use their smart cards to access the mail box,
   validate, and endorse the checks. They will then forward the checks to
   BankBoston or NationsBank, the two authorized banks, that will deposit
   them into their accounts.
   The smart cards, which include digital certificates developed by GTE
   Cybertrust, will play a critical role in helping the defense
   department and other agencies comply with a mandate that requires most
   of the 800 million payments the government makes every year be
   converted to electronic form by January 1, 1999.    Because of the mandate, the number of smart-card applications in
   different stages of development within the government has doubled to
   more than 900 in the past year, says Jim Hagedorn, a spokesperson for
   the Treasury Department.
   That's good news for vendors such as Anthony Caputo, chairman of
   Information Resource Engineering (IRE) in Baltimore, which develops
   the smart cards and the readers for the e-check program.    "It will create a nice revenue stream," Caputo says, adding that his
   company has issued 100,000 smart cards to government and corporate
   customers mostly for use in private networks.
   Now with the Internet, the smart card market could grow
   substantially, especially in Asia and Europe. "Smart cards are the
   ultimate personal network computers," capable of handling everything
   from simple tasks such as identification to complex ones such as
   online banking and electronic commerce, says Philip Yen, senior vice
   president of chip platform at Visa International in Foster City, CA.
   [TABLE NOT SHOWN]
   Both Visa and its rival MasterCard are engaged in smart-card pilots
   around the world, promoting the use of stored-valued chip cards that
   run on private networks or the Internet.
   For example, AT&T Universal Card is working with Mondex, the
   electronic cash venture majority-owned by MasterCard, to sign up a
   small number of online merchants for a pilot program that will allow
   Internet users to buy products from them using smart cards issued by
   AT&T.
   However, analysts expect acceptance of smart cards in the United
   States to be slower than that in other countries because of privacy
   concerns, interoperability issues (Visa and MasterCard use different
   operating systems, for example), and the desire to put as many complex
   applications as possible on a single card.

In plain English, that translates to a smart card that can be used to allow people to
 pay all of their taxes, including income tax, national insurance, and local taxes, as
 well as apply for passports, state benefits, and other forms of government welfare.
 The idea behind the smart card, according to Peter Kilfoyle, the British public
 services minister, is that people will be able to use the card to identify themselves
 to the various government computers, all of which will be interlinked with each
 other.  Kilfoyle claims that there are "huge potential savings" to be had from the
 introduction of the smart card, although he revealed that possessing a card will be
 voluntary. When questioned further on this, he admitted, however, that people
 could find it difficult to operate in the future without such a card. Initially, the citizen's smart card will rely on traditional PIN protection systems to
 allow a person to ID themselves alongside the card to the government computer
 systems. In the longer term, and certainly within the next five years, the plan is to
 allow an individual to use a fingerprint or similar biometric system for positive
 identification. Fingerprinting everyone on the planet: those of you in CA and a handful
of other states have already been fingerprinted "so you can drive".
Police will eventually be able to stop anyone and demand to check
their fingerprints via cheap small portable scanners.
EFF/EPIC etc need to specifically target these biometric systems
as being way over the top.
Totally unnecessary.
   How did you CA cypherpunks feel about being fingerprinted?

This jerk should be kicked out of EFF.
Brad had stated he wants to eliminate one-way anonymous remailers,
make two-way anonymous remailer users identify themselves as the
same person every time they use one, and:
   o require digital signature identification for all email
   o require digital signature identification for all Usenet posts
--------- previously shown -------------
Brad Templeton emailed:
*   Information Security emailed:
*   > Nor does your digital signature idea do anything to prevent
*   > throw-away accounts from doing major spams; you'll have to
*   > put even MORE controls on people.
*   Correct, no throw away accounts.  It's coming.

[I said false: ALL problem posters are locateable to their ISP]
     [snipped] [by Brad]
    Solutions...
    First, improve internet mail systems and protocols to
    identify mail with a fake or forged return address.
    There are some simple steps to do this, and
    eventually digital signature allows complete
    verification of the sender.
        Q: What about anonymous remailers?
    A: A person with an anonymous address that sends mail back will
    probably be able to get a certificate. They can post without revealing
    their name, except perhaps to the person who gives them a certificate.
    Digital signature works fine to prove the same person sent two messages
    without saying at all who that person is in the real world.
Forced to authenticate they are the same
person, even through the anonymous remailer.
--------- end of previously shown -------------
What's new is Brad has inserted his declaration that access
to the Net must require you to authenticate yourself with
a digital signature to post to Usenet in the draft text
for the new Usenet RFC, which he is heading:
Brad's draft Usenet digital signature text:
#   Systems MAY insist that an article be signed, at least the
#   body and the minimal header set, or they MAY reject the
#   article.  This policy may vary from group to group and
#   subnet to subnet.  Eventually it is expected that a site
#   SHOULD reject any article that is not signed.
Hey, fine if an individual group wants to vote it in.
But ALL OF USENET???
I asked him if he would change the wording to:
#   An individual group MAY insist that an article be signed,
#   at least the body and the minimal header set. This is
#   subject to the normal news standards of users of a group
#   deciding this issue themselves.
Dead silence.
He REFUSES TO DISCUSS the last statement:
#   Eventually it is expected that a site
#   SHOULD reject any article that is not signed.
It is a purely political statement on his part,
pushing his vision of a tightly authenticated
Net, like they have in China.
In fact, it is utterly clueless of him, especially since he
was one of the original CDA plaintiffs. [Not to mention it
is an "agreement to make an agreement"]
NONE of the other list participants has said they agree everyone
should authenticate themselves using digital signatures for all
Usenet posts, which is the language I am contesting.
Yet, he won't even discuss the ramifications.
Yep, power corrupts: he's running the show, and answers to no one.

The Supreme Court's CDA ruling:
Once most people are fingerprinted, a cheap (say $50) fingerprint scanner that
attaches a timestamp and government digital signature will be sold for allowing
Internet access to "adult" locations---chat rooms, USENET, WWW sites---and it
will be mandatory. The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court said as soon
as the "Internet driver's license" is technically feasible, CDA becomes legal.
   "Such technology requires Internet users to enter information about
    themselves--perhaps an adult identification number or a credit card
    number--before they can access certain areas of cyberspace, 929 F. Supp.
    824, 845 (ED Pa. 1996), much like a bouncer checks a person's driver's

How come there is no organized opposition to fingerprinting

Are we all going to silently roll over and accept this NSA crap???
It's our tax money, but we NEVER got to vote on it.
How about some cypherpunk with money challenging it on the
basis shown below of violating Privacy Act of 1974?
Sure, government can give debate reasons for requiring fingerprinting
for driver's licenses...
But it is still a violation of the minimization requirement of the Privacy
Act of 1974.
Biometric data on citizens is FAR BEYOND any reason government can give.
Notice how no citizens in any state ever got to vote on such an important
escalation of personal data collection by the government.
Indeed, it seems to be accomplished in the quietest way possible, giving
citizens the least amount of opportunity to choose their fate.
Odd, since tax-payer paid-for government services is what gives them the power.
But elected representatives will do, you say?
Did you hear any of them mention it during campaigning?
Did Alabama elected officials even mention it with their press
release of a new driver's license, despite that being the plan?
What does that tell you?
We need a cabinet-level Privacy Commission,
with the power to intervene nationwide.
Power to protect us little people from fanatical personal data collection.
We are losing it piece by piece.
Who would have thought the United States would
collect fingerprints from all citizens?
This is the main way our Federal Government is rolling out the National ID
Card, using a Universal Biometric Card: driver's licenses.
Divide and Conquer, state by state.
It is the beginning of the end.
Don't think the biometric driver's licenses are the exact equivalent of a
National ID Card? Check out this phrasing from an unimplemented law:

#   document for all Americans.
Collect biometric information from everyone...

!   !   The failure seems to stem from the local offices not transmitting the

!   TERMINATING BENEFITS OF PEOPLE THE COMPUTER THOUGHT WERE NOT FINGERPRINTED.
Prior to the fingerprint "final solution" of control over us, there were
other attempts---which would have required a vote---which tried to roll
out a National ID Card.
*   "Project L.U.C.I.D.", by Texe Marrs, 1996, ISBN 1-884302-02-5
*   *   Since total and absolute control can be obtained only by a Police State
*   bureaucracy, efforts have escalated in recent years to require a National
*   ID Card.
*   *   Upon Bill Clinton's election as President, Secretary of Health and Human
*   Services Donna Shalala and Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy jointly
*   developed a $100 million plan to require all children and babies to have
*   a dossier established in a national computer registry to insure "universal
*   mandatory vaccinations."
*   *   When patriotic Americans rose up to protest, the U.S. Senate quietly
*   shelved the deceptive Shalala-Kennedy proposal.
*   *   The Clinton administration next surfaced with its mandatory health care
*   plan. A key component of this plot to socialize medical care was the
*   requirement of a computer I.D. card for every American, linked to a master
*   computer network.
*   *   Martin Anderson, writing in The Washington Times:
*       President Clinton held the pretty red, white and blue "smart card" in
*       his hand when he addressed the nation, proudly waving it like a small
*       American flag.
*       Only it wasn't a flag; it was a "health security card"---his slick
*       name for a national identity card. Under his plan a new National
*       Health Board would establish "national, unique identifier numbers"
*       for every single one of us.
*       Fortunately, President Bill Clinton's healthcare scam never made it
*       into law. Sadly, few of the complainers were upset about the potential
*       for abuse by Big Brother.
*   Shortly after being elected, one Clinton advisor promoting the biochip
*   'mark' is Dr. Mary Jane England, a member of Hillary Clinton's ill-fated
*   socialized, national healthcare initiative. Addressing a conference
*   sponsored by computer giant IBM [IBM's Lotus division takes hand biometrics
*   of employees who use their childcare facilities] in Palm Springs,
*   California, in 1994, England not only endorsed the proposed mandatory
*   national I.D. smart card, but went one scary step further:
*       The smart card is a wonderful idea, but even better would be the
*       capacity to not have a card, and I call it "a chip in your ear,"
*       that would actually access your medical records, so that no matter
*       where you were, even if you came into an emergency room unconscious,
*       we would have some capacity to access that medical record.
*       We need to go beyond the narrow conceptualization of the smart card
*       and really use some of the technology that's out there.
*   California Governor Pete Wilson has actively stumped for a National I.D.
*   Card system, using the straw man of California's pervasive immigration
*   problem. California Senators Diane Feinstein and Barbara Boxer support
*   it too. The latest proposal is to mandate I.D. cards for all school
*   children under the Goals 2000 national education program. Another plan
*   by the U.S. Labor Department would have required it for all users of a
*   National Job Training and Employment database.
*   George Orwell, in 1984, his classic novel of Big Brother and a coming
*   totalitarian state, observed that very few people are awake and alert
*   to the machinations and manipulations of the controllers. Thus, the
*   people, as a whole, fall victim to a colossal conspiracy out of ignorance
*   and because of apathy and denial of reality:
*       The people could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of
*       reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was
*       demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public
*       events to notice what was happening.
    By Walter Cronkite: "Orwell's '1984'---Nearing?", NYT, June 5 1983
    In our world, where a Vietnam village can be destroyed so it can be
    saved; where the President names the latest thing in nuclear missiles
    "Peacekeeper"---in such a world, can the Orwellian vision be very far
    away?
    Big Brother's ears have plugs in them right now (or they are, by law,
    supposed to), at least on the domestic telephone and cable traffic.
    But the National Security Agency's ability to monitor microwave
    transmissions, to scoop out of the air VAST numbers of communications,
    including telephone conversations, store them in computers, play them
    back later, has a truly frightening potential for abuse.
    George Orwell issued a warning.
    He told us that freedom is too much taken for granted, that it needs to
    be carefully watched and protected. His last word on the subject was a
    plea to his readers: "Don't let it happen. It depends on you."
*   The National Security Agency's Project L.U.C.I.D., with all its

It is technology driving the capabilities, it is our government using
them ruthlessly: without letting us vote on it.
Never before could someone walk up to you and number you by scanning
your fingerprints. A number that is yours and yours alone.
You have been numbered for all time.
No ID card needed once portable fingerprint scanners are deployed all over!
If the government suddenly ordered all citizens to be numbered with an
indelible invisible ink on their arms so they were permanently numbered;
so law enforcement could scan them at will: there would be a revolt.
Yet that is what is happening.
Fingerprints, scanned into a computer, are a number.
The number is inescapably yours.
Modern technology means they don't have to put the number on you, they can
read it off of you by minutely examining your body.
And: it is the NSA driving the fingerprint-rollout of the national ID card.

If my attempts to show how bad a thing this is have been too rambling,
too abstract, here is a simple and accurate analogy:
*   "Project L.U.C.I.D.", by Texe Marrs, 1996, ISBN 1-884302-02-5
*   It was Martin Anderson who, in his book, Revolution, revealed that during

*   were urging President Ronald Reagan to implement a computerized National
*   I.D. Card.
*   The rationale for the proposal was that such a system would help put a lid
*   on illegal immigration. [Reagan had been Governor of California]
*   But Anderson, who at the time was a domestic advisor to the President and
*   sat in on this particular cabinet meeting, spoke up and gave the group
*   something to think about.
*   "I would like to suggest another way that I think is a lot better," he
*   told them, serious in demeanor but clearly being facetious. "It's a lot
*   cheaper, it can't be counterfeited. It's very lightweight, and it's
*   impossible to lose. It's even waterproof."
*   "All we have to do," Anderson continued, "is tattoo an identification
*   number on the inside of everybody's arm."
*   His reference was to the tattooing of numbers on victims in Nazi
*   concentration camps. Survivors still bear the dreaded tattoo markings
*   to this day.
*   Mr. Anderson described the stunned reaction of those present, "There were
*   several gasps around the table. A couple cabinet members looked as if they
*   had been slapped. No one said anything for a long time."
*   Ronald Reagan, a consummately wise politician who professed a belief in
*   Bible prophecy, caught the implication [about The Mark of the Devil].
*   He then hushed the cabinet and efficiently dismissed the National ID Card
*   proposal by sardonically remarking, "Maybe we should just brand all babies."
        "Those that give up essential liberty for a little

It was quite unnecessary: all a company has to do is require
all company business email contact go through the company's systems,
even if home.
Furthermore, brokers send email during the work day - like the
list of AXEs they have for that day - and send it in the morning.
Home email directly to clients is basically non-existent.

It is standard practice to trust only the last "Received" line.

But these keys must be registered somewhere: whether it's at a centralized
site or distributed, *requiring* everyone to have a digital signature for
Internet access is twisting this elegant crypto-related technology: to
number each and every one of us, and is exactly what will make CDA legal,
because as soon as it's in place attributes such as "age" will be attached.
Required identity repositories are a bad idea.
   >   Relaying is a big problem.
What, you want _me_ to solve the UCE problem?
I think if Brad (EFF Director) Templeton's whitelist system were
made available at the firewall/enterprise level, then widely
deployed, spam would be dead.
It's a handy little bot-reply mechanism that asks unknown authors
to verify they aren't sending UCE, else face a monetary penalty.
Replying correctly automatically causes the original email to go through.
Thus achieving the legal right to sue the spammer without
the legislation CAUCE is pushing.
The most important part of this design is that it requires
no control-freak changes to the Internet.
Don't suggest solutions that *require* digital signatures of everyone.
This might work too:
Throttle email going through the ISP's mailserver.
Maybe 5/minute limit, flagging attempts to go faster to the admins.
As for direct PPP connectivity, upgrade router software to throttle.
(Port SMTP traffic)
Certain people, at the ISP's choice, would have a higher limit,
for mailing lists and such.
   Think.

CM excerpt:
#  Those rumor-level stories about our government encouraging

#   #   #  Recently...
#   #  :   CBS 60 Minutes, Steve Croft reporting.
#  :
#  :   Remember that story of the hero customs agent snagging a tanker truck full
#  :   of cocaine? There is a strange twist to the story.
#  :
#  :   The Federal agent's manager repeatedly tried to interfere with him making
#  :   the bust.
#  :
#  :   The agent's dog had flagged the truck; the agent weighed it and found a
#  :   discrepancy. His manager said it must be in the tires. You can only check
#  :   the tires for drugs he was told.
#  :
#  :   But the agent persisted, and made the bust. His manager let the driver
#  :   of the truck leave. The driver literally fled on foot back to Mexico.
#   #  What the hell was that about???
#   #  Was it a single corrupt Federal agent?
#   #  :   CBS 60 Minutes, Steve Croft reporting.
#  :
#  :   Standing at a fence about a hundred feet from the U.S. Customs lanes,
#  :   Steve Croft and an ex-agent with a walkie-talkie tuned to the right
#  :   frequency began videotaping the border crossings.
#  :
#  :   Truck after truck drove right through the individual Customs lanes,
#  :   not even stopping. "Nafta express lanes" explained the ex-agent.
#  :
#  :   Truck after truck drove straight into the U.S. unmonitored.
#  :
#  :   Then a message came through the walkie-talkie: "We got some cameras
#  :   watching, better get out there and cover traffic".
#  :
#  :   Suddenly several Customs agents came out of the booths and started
#  :   inspecting trucks.
#   #  That makes at least five people at a minimum!
#   #  What the hell is going on???
#  #   #  IF the rumor is true, THIS looks like it would be the smoking gun.
#   #  How did our country get so twisted around that they can invade our

#  *
#  *   Due to their new 'Mexicanization policy':
#  *   Mexico became the main gateway into the United States for illegal
#  *   narcotics, with the amount of cocaine making the journey climbing to
#  *   an estimated 210 tons last year.
#  *
#  *   Mexico's drug arrests plunged nearly 65 percent, from 27,369 the year
#  *   before the policy changes to 9,728 last year, according to data that
#  *   the Mexican government supplied to the State Department.
#  *
#  *   Cocaine seizures in Mexico were cut in half, dropping from more than
#  *   50 tons in 1993 to slightly more than 24 tons in each of the last two
#  *   years -- the smallest amounts since 1988, Mexican government figures

#  *   the force.
#  *
#  *   In November 1993, President Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive
#  *   No. 14, shifting U.S. anti-drug efforts away from intercepting cocaine as
#  *   it passed through Mexico and the Caribbean, and, instead, attacking the
#  *   drug supply at its sources in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.

And, I hear the anonymizer blocks some highly useful sites like
DejaNews, which would have been a handy way to post anonymously.
And I can turn off Java and cookies.

The Aussies are obligated by treaty for the crypto/spying stuff.
We Americans spy on all your domestic traffic by treaty.
You can also request specifically targeted AU-domestic information
from our personnel manning in AU the spy equipment, and we hand it
to them.
That's what the UKUSA (pronounced you-koo-za) agreement is all about:
none of your people have broken any domestic spy laws. The British
provide that service for us in Fort Meade, VA, we provide that service
to the British in Menwith Hill...
The EU recently declared the NSA was performing massive EU-domestic
spying: that's how we have access. (It also confirms the entire
massive US-domestic NSA spying claim of the Cryptography Manifesto)
There has been a stunning lack of outrage to the EU statement: I'd
have thought USA-based privacy groups and reporters would jump all
over it.
#   "Moynihan Says U.S. Killed His Anti-Spy Measure"
#   By Irvin Molotsky, The New York Times, September 11, 1985
#   Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan charged that the CIA and State Department
#   had killed a measure he had introduced aimed at protecting American
#   citizens from having their telephone conversations intercepted by foreign
#   agents in this country.
#   The Senator's bill would have made telephone call interception by foreign
#   agents illegal and would have provided for their expulsion.
#   The Chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence opposed the measure

You'll have to purchase the "Project L.U.C.I.D." book for more details
[that I snipped] from the Australian "National Surveillance" report.
Snipped: some Australian politicians chased around trying to find out what the NSA was doing, then reversing themselves ("nothing's happening..").
I have to admit, it wasn't until I read this Australian report that
I realized most of NASA's space shots were military.

*   "Project L.U.C.I.D.", by Texe Marrs, 1996, ISBN 1-884302-02-5
*   *   Appendix 2: World Surveillance Headquarters
*   *   The report that follows, originally entitled "National Surveillance", was
*   written by Australia's Peter Sawer and published in Inside News (P.O. Box
*   311, Maleny, Queensland 4552, Australia). It first came to my attention
*   when it was printed in the U.S. by LtCol Archibald E. Robert's Bulletin,
*   the newsletter of the highly respected Committee to Restore the Constitu-
*   tion (P.O. Box 986, Fort Collins, Colorado 80522).
*   *   The article caused a flurry of activity and a round of vigorous denials,
*   admissions, coverups, and more denials by Australian political leaders.
*   *   The article contends that (1) America's National Security Agency (NSA)
*   is the world surveillance headquarters, and (2) Australia has it's own
*   secret "computer center", linked with the NSA via satellite, which
*   illegally watches over Australia's citizenry.
Article snippets... capitalization by the original authors...
*   On a fateful fall day in America, on November 4th, 1952, a new United
*   States government agency quietly was brought into existence through
*   presidential decree.
*   *   The birth of the National Security Agency on that day so long ago
*   heralded the beginning of the world's most sophisticated and all
*   encompassing surveillance system, and the beginnings of the greatest
*   threat to individual liberty and freedom not only in Australia, but
*   the entire planet will ever see.
*   *   The NSA grew out of the post war "Signals Intelligence" section of the
*   U.S. War Department. It is unique amongst government organizations in
*   America, and indeed most other countries, in that there are NO specified
*   or defined limits to its powers.
*   *   The NSA can (and does) do just about whatever it wants, whenever, and
*   wherever it wants. Although little known in both the U.S. and elsewhere,
*   the NSA is quite literally the most powerful organization in the world.
*   *   Not limited by any law, and answerable only to the U.S. National Security
*   Council through COMSEC, the NSA now controls an information and
*   surveillance network around the globe that even Orwell, in his novel
*   "1984", could not have imagined.
*   *   Most people believe that the current "computer age" grew out of either
*   the space program or the nuclear weapons race; it did not.
*   *   ALL significant advances in computer technology over the last thirty
*   years, from the very beginnings of IBM, through to the super computers
*   of today, have been for the NSA. In fact, the world's very first super
*   computer, the awe-inspiring CRAY, was built to specification for the
*   NSA, and installed in their headquarters in 1976.
*   *   The entire twentieth century of development of computer technology has
*   been the result of the NSA's unquenchable thirst for ever bigger, ever
*   faster machines on which to collect, collate, and cross-reference data
*   on hundreds of millions of honest, law-abiding, and totally unsuspecting
*   individuals. And not only in America, but in many other countries as
*   well. Including, as we shall see, Australia.
    "The Rise of the Computer State", David Burnham, 1984
    p134: ...the technical advances that were occurring did so not entirely
    by chance. The computers' ability to acquire, organize, store and
    retrieve huge amounts of data was an essential factor leading to the
    broad definition of intelligence that was fostered by the National
    Security Agency and its godfather, the National Security Council.
    Computer research was supported by NSA in a major way by secret research
    dollars. Thomas C. Reed, Director of the Pentagon's Telecommunications,
    Command and Control System, referring to domestic intercity telephone
    microwave radio trunks, said in 1975, "Modern computer techniques make
    it possible to sort through that traffic and find target conversations
    easily."
    p126-127: Since the wiretap law barred the Bureau of Narcotics and
    Dangerous Drugs from installing a tap on New York City's Grand Central
    Station pay phones, bureau head John Ingersoll asked the NSA for help.
    Within a few months the spy agency was sorting through all the
    conversations it was already acquiring for general intelligence
    purposes.
    Of course, the technicians were required to acquire, monitor, and
    discard a large number of calls made by people with no connection
    with the cocaine business in South American cities.
    But so pleased was Mr. Ingersoll with the tips he was getting from the
    dragnet monitoring that he ultimately persuaded the NSA to monitor
    simultaneously nineteen other U.S. communication hubs.
*   "Project L.U.C.I.D.", continued...
*   *    Fort Meade is the hub of an information gathering octopus whose tentacles
*    reach out to the four corners of the earth.
*    *    The principal means of communicating this information is by the National
*    Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) satellite communications
*    system, which most people erroneously think exists primarily for the
*    space program.
*    *    It does not.
*    *    The satellites, indeed NASA and the entire American Space Program, exist
*    largely to supply the NSA with its telecommunications system. That is why
*    the bulk of its operations are officially declared 'secret'. This
*    ultimate 'Big Brother' machine even has an official name 'Project
*    Platform'.
    "The Puzzle Palace": all these computer systems are linked together
    under Project Platform. The first Cray went to the NSA. p138
*   Although the NSA was officially formed in 1952, it grew out of an
*   International Agreement signed in 1947. Officially termed the "UKUSA
*   PACT," this was an agreement between Britain, the U.S.A., Canada, New
*   Zealand, Australia and the NATO countries.
*   *   The UKUSA PACT was, quite simply and bluntly, an agreement between these
*   countries to collect and collate information on their respective citizens
*   and to share this information with each other and pass on to Fort Meade.
*   *   On March 9th 1977, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Bill Hayden, asked
*   "questions on notice" on the subject. On April 19, Prime Minister Malcom
*   Fraser, declined to answer the questions, "in the interests of national
*   security."
*   *   The first clue of the Australian Headquarters of PROJECT PLATFORM appeared
*   in 1975. Then, as today, government undertakings involving expenditure
*   over a certain amount must be presented to a Senate body, the Joint
*   Parliamentary Accounts Committee (JPAC). In 1975 JPAC was asked to
*   examine and approve finance for the construction of a new building in
*   Deakin, a leafy suburb of Canberra.
*   *   This quite massive building was to be constructed behind an existing, much
*   smaller one, which, until then, had been known to the public only as the
*   "Deakin Telephone Exchange."
*   *   That it was not, and never had been, simply a "telephone exchange" finally
*   came to light in the 1975 JPAC Approval Report, when it admitted that the
*   existing building had a comprehensive basement which housed NASA's micro-
*   wave communications headquarters in Australia. Part of the justification
*   of the "need" for the new, much larger building, was that by 1980, it was
*   expected that NASA would run out of room in their existing home.
*   *   Apart from NASA, it is now admitted that Deakin houses the National
*   Computer Headquarters for, amongst others, the Australian Defense
*   Department, the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Social
*   Security, the Commonwealth Department of Education, and the Department
*   of Transport and Communications.
*   *   Both Tax and Social Security are, in turn, directly linked to Medicare.
*   In fact, the Department of Health used Social Security's computer
*   facilities there until their own were completed.
*   *   A small, but highly significant, part of the building is, in fact,
*   occupied by Telecom. This is the part that contains the networking
*   junctions for the optical-fiber lines leased by the banks for their
*   "Electronic Funds Transfer System" (EFTS). ALL financial transactions
*   for the banks pass through there via subsidiary company, "Funds
*   Transfers Services Pty Ltd." (FTS)

Labeled the "Consumer Biometric Privacy Protection Act of
1998," the bill prohibits trafficking in biometric databases,
mandates increased security for storing such data, and
prevents businesses from recording data for biometric
identification without the owner's consent. The bill also
increases the severity of identity theft, from a misdemeanor
to a felony. "How would you like your fingerprints to be sold over the Internet?"
"[Biometric] identifiers [have the potential] to provide an
efficient, unintrusive, and accurate means of identifying
consumers in a variety of commercial and government
applications," said the text of the bill. A massive proliferation of "fingertip scanning" products...
In separate efforts to strengthen the rapidly evolving
biometric industry, vendors and industry groups have
announced three separate biometric APIs, each proposed
as "the standard API" for biometric application
development. Now the real work begins, as developers,
users, industry associations, manufacturing interests and
government agencies express their opinions on which to
back or on how to roll them into one.
The National Registry Inc. ( was the first to
unveil a universal standard, dubbed HA-API, although
IBM had announced its coming API previously. NRI
developed HA-API as an initiative for the U.S. Department
of Defense. The outcome is a high-level umbrella for any
biometric technology, although the specification currently
supports only the Win32 environment. NRI has
demonstrated HA-API's capability by implementing it in its
line of fingertip scanning products, as well as in Keyware
Technologies Inc.'s Voice Guardian speaker verification

Hey, maybe _you_ would get a warm and fuzzy feeling when
Dimitry posts a death threat (including to this list) and
signs your name: not me.

No dirty tricks involved: I complained to PSINet using traffic analysis.
If he had simply called me a cocksucker, I would not have complained.

In addition to death threats, forging death threats: he tries to get
people fired from their jobs.
But Dimitry can't figure out where I work (MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA), reducing
him to saying I was fired from where I _used to_ work.
This stalking: attempting to deprive someone of their right to work.

Oh, great, an independently wealthy person is telling me it's not a problem
that a known stalker has posted angrily to this list asking if anyone knows
where I work.

Then please explain why you agree with Adam, since I decided to complain

Ahhh, that's the wrong question. Look past your nose.
Calling me a pedophile is one part of Vulis' patented style of stalking
attacks. Add to that him saying I was fired from consulting work for
being a pedophile, asking if anyone knows where I now work, etc: stalking.
It wasn't merely him being insulting, but part of a larger
Simon-Barr-Sinister pattern of behavior.
Certain behavior is not permissible regardless of the venue.
Not a direct analogy, but: you would censor (CENSOR! CENSOR!) people
who work for you who wanted to speak "Ebonics" on the job.
Gosh, how dare you deprive them of their right to free speech!.

Exactly what I said: I submitted traffic analysis reports ("the big picture")
regarding Vulis' stalking activity via PSINet to their legal people.
I have previously posted to this list a dejanews URL for an early
traffic analysis report on him that I posted to Usenet.
It was like that, only more complete and specifically oriented towards
getting him spanked.
   >   Did it involve calls to law enforcement?
He used an anonymous remailer for the death threat.
His personal stalking of me didn't get far before I blew him off PSINet.
I'm sure he's learned his lesson. ;-)
He's still here, but sulking silently. He's run out of dirty tricks.
   >   Is it likely that your claims would have been relayed by PSI to law
   >   enforcement?
Oh, I _wish_ I had that kind of influence.
Of course, in the Cryptography Manifesto polemic, I have said not-nice
things about law enforcement, as part of complaining about Key Recovery
and the general Orwellian state of affairs.
Guy's CM: Louis Freeh is a Scary Man with the morals of a styrofoam cup.
On the other hand, I do believe most FBI personnel are good people
who perform an invaluable service for all of us.
Guy's CM: This posting isn't about the many good FBI and other law enforcement people.
Gee, could I do a better job of offending both "sides"? ;-)

   >   and your claims are untrue, or exaggerated, I think you owe it to

   >   What did you tell PSInet?
I documented his stalking behavior via PSINet, documented that he
had begun stalking me via PSINet, and stated that if they didn't
terminate him and he continued stalking me, I would sue them.
And that the traffic analysis report they were holding was
what a jury would use to decide PSINet was liable for their
continued (after _years_ of people's complaints) inaction.
    With Vulis, the best defense is a good offense.

Because he posted under his own name ~"Chris Lewis should die", etc, and it
matches up with the death threat. He is massively on record in his own
name for stalking Chris Lewis, and contacting Chris Lewis at the same
It was good enough for legal counsel.
   Plus the easily documented job-stalking of various people.

PSINet snatcheroo?
That's getting tough on complaints. ;-)
I've only submitted a complaint to PSINet so far.
Haven't gotten around to Altopia.
I do actually work for a living, despite Vulis' claims.
He posted from 'cj3 _after_ being terminated from PSINet.

      718-261-6839
   >   BTW, I'm in Manhattan. Vox: 212-873-8700.
Ain't it great here in NYC, Third Planet From the Sun?
You could always go over and knock on his door.
I hear he posted a picture of himself to the Net in 1992,
and that "he looked dorky, and his wife fat".
Hey, Vulis is probably looking for a real job.
Maybe he's finally found one.
I can hear him saying:
   "Would you like fries with that?"

#  #  Q: Who is Dimitri Vulis?
#  A: Dimitri is an XSoviet immigrant.
#  He harasses people all over the net with the most offensive sorts of messages,
#  and uses dirty tricks to retaliate to the people who do get offended. Among
#  his accomplished feats is a series of articles about cat-eating dogs posted to
#  rec.pets.cats (which caused a wave of complaints and made him lost his CUNY
#  account) ; a series of porno binaries with obscene comments about his
#  opponents posted to math-related newsgroups (he lost another academic account,
#  at fordham.edu, after this scandal);

#     8/3/97 #     Dimitri Vulis, Adjunct Instructor in Computer Science. BA, MA, CUNY
#     Dimitri: I haven't been teaching at Fordham for a few years.
#              It's too far and the pay's too low.
#  ]
#  ...and a series of racist articles denigrating all aspects of romanian life
#  and culture which used to haunt the romanian newsgroup for years.

Or trying to be consistent.
Raygun: abortion is killing, but pro-death penalty.
If killing is wrong, killing again is wrong.
Also, there is the part about his brother turning
him in to get help (UB tried to get mental help,
but couldn't get it), and didn't turn him in
to get killed.
Next time, the killer might not be caught because
the person who recognized (yea traffic analysis)

 NSA concerns could hamper DOD Y2K fix
 BY BOB BREWIN (antenna
 HEATHER HARRELD (heather
 DANIEL M. VERTON (dan_verton
 The National Security Agency has slapped a security blanket on the
 Pentagon's efforts to fix the Year 2000 millennium bug, which could further
 slow the Defense Department's already-behind-schedule Year 2000 fixes.
 NSA has determined that all information detailing DOD's computers and its
 efforts to fix the Year 2000 problem are a "national security interest" and
 "highly sensitive." As a result, the Pentagon has cut off the military
 and DOD project offices from the Defense Integrated Support Tool (DIST)
 database, which the Defense Information Systems Agency maintains to
 provide details on all DOD computer systems and interfaces for use in
 planning and deployment.
 DIST, according to DISA, is a database of some 9,000 DOD systems that
 the department uses to track such key areas as system interfaces, compliance
 with high-priority standards, interoperability testing, consolidation
goals and
 Year 2000-compliance planning. DIST was seen as critical to the Year 2000
 problem because it provides a central source of information about interfaces
 between different DOD systems, which is a chief concern of Year 2000
 conversion efforts.
 DOD began using DIST to track Year 2000 compliance in August 1996, and
 a Dec. 19, 1997, memo from the Office of the Secretary of Defense to DOD
 chief information officers identified DIST as the "central, authoritative
 database for tracking resolution of the Year 2000-related problems for
 systems throughout the department."
 That aggregation of extensive details about Year 2000 problems with DOD
 systems poses a threat to national security, according to NSA.
 "The DOD's Y2K conversion effort is a national security interest," NSA
 reported in a statement supplied to FCW. "All information detailing these
 information systems and the progress being made toward their conversions is
 considered to be highly sensitive."
 DOD is not trying to cover up information about its Year 2000 efforts, a
 DOD spokeswoman said. "We couldn't hide what we're doing if we wanted
 to, and we certainly don't want to," she said. "The idea is to move these
 along at the fastest possible clip but not to jeopardize other security
 as we do it."
 While industry and service sources said they could understand NSA's security
 concerns, they said the classification could hobble the Pentagon's
 already-delayed Year 2000 remediation efforts. One former high-ranking
 DOD official described the classification issue as symptomatic of what he
 called the Pentagon's "gross mismanagement" of Year 2000 issues.

Statement for the Record
FBI Director Louis J. Freeh before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
September 3, 1998
Good morning Chairman Hatch and members of the judiciary committee. I
am pleased to be with you this morning as you explore the U.S.
Government's response to international terrorism.
THE FUTURE
Would like to close by talking briefly about steps we can take to
further strengthen our abilities to prevent and investigate terrorist
One of the most important of these steps involves the FBI's encryption
initiative. Communication is central to any collaborative effort --
including criminal conspiracies. Like most criminals, terrorists are
naturally reluctant to put the details of their plots down on paper.
Thus, they generally depend on oral or electronic communication to
formulate the details of their terrorist activities.
For this reason, the law enforcement community is very concerned about
the serious threat posed by the proliferation of encryption
technology. Current standards do not allow for law enforcement access
or the timely decryption of critical evidence obtained through lawful
electronic surveillance or search and seizures.
The FBI supports a balanced encryption policy that satisfies fourth
amendment concerns for privacy, the commercial needs of industry for
robust encryption, and the government's public safety and national
security needs.
The encryption capabilities available to criminals and terrorists
today effectively thwart the ability of law enforcement agencies to
implement the court-ordered surveillance techniques that have helped
put some of the nation's most dangerous offenders behind bars. Whether
a state police department is racing the clock to find a kidnapped
child or the FBI is attempting to track and prevent the destructive
ambitions of an international terrorist group, the need for timely
access to legally obtained electronic surveillance cannot be
EXPANSION OF FBI LEGATS
Likewise, the expansion of the number of FBI LEGATS around the world
has enhanced the ability of the FBI to prevent, respond to, and
investigate terrorist acts committed by international terrorists
against U.S. Interests worldwide. As evidenced by developments in the
embassy bombing cases in East Africa, the ability to bring
investigative resources to bear quickly in the aftermath of a
terrorist act can have significant impact on our ability to identify
those responsible. I encourage Congress to support our efforts to
counter the international terrorist threat by continuing to support
expansion of our LEGAT program.

They have stated so openly; ~"if we hear a lot of encrypted hiss from [CALEA]
intercepts, we'll need GAK to be the law of the land". (a tilde before the
quote means I am paraphrasing).
In fact, at the same time the FBI used to say they weren't calling for
such a law, they were pushing behind the scenes for it.

Declan, wanna track down this person and find out the names of those
who spoke of the ultra-secret UKUSA treaty that's never been seen,
and interview them?
When Sonny Bono hit a tree, yet another Senator convinced by the FBI/NSA's
little presentation of horrors (which is preceded by a visible sweep for
electronic bugs) was lost. Only an Executive Order seems like it will get
domestic crypto "outlawed".
One continued worrisome slant to the FBI/NSAs pushing for domestic GAK
is that they use the same arguments for retaining export controls (which
Clinton did by Executive Order, or they would have expired) as they give
for wanting to extend these controls domestically.
LART me if I'm wrong, but that makes the issue different from most
other export-controlled non-secret technology/products.
I still think someone (without a job ;-) should test the export law
by pulling in PGP from outside the US and then immediately putting
it back at the same site.
If could find someone on the lower East Side willing to do it
for $5000. Gilmore, care to make another investment in making
the government's position look silly? ;-)

   Speaking as someone who monitors company Internet traffic (email)
for compliance and security purposes, I would like to ask why the IETF
is working on a key recovery standard.
   If a company chooses to deploy, say, PGP with key recovery internally,
then any messages sent with it encrypted in the receiving party's public
key are available to the sending company's Information Security personnel.
   If a company wishes to make the key recovery information available
to the government, they can individually choose to do that.
   The IETF should not be helping to put such an infrastructure in place.
   Governments are our adversaries with respect to encryption and privacy.
   The US government, represented by the FBI/NSA, used to state that they
weren't pushing for mandatory domestic encryption. (requiring people use
curtains on their homes that the government can see through)
   Eventually we found out they lied, and were pushing for exactly that
behind the scenes:
*   *   SECRET FBI report
*                         *                   NEED FOR A NATIONAL POLICY  *                             *   A national policy embodied in legislation is needed which insures

*   All cryptography that cannot meet this standard should be prohibited.
   Feel free to cite this manipulation when discarding key recovery proposals.
   If you put a key recovery proposal in place, it makes it that much
easier for them to require its use.
   Plus my basic complaint: this proposal is of no use to business
or Internet users.
   None.
   Its only purpose is to allow interception and decoding over the Internet.
   And if you think this would happen only with a court order, check out
this "anytime, anywhere" wording by the US government...

P468-469: Within the United States, FISA still leaves the NSA free to pull
into its massive vacuum cleaner every telephone call and message entering,
leaving, OR TRANSITING the country.
By carefully inserting the words "by the National Security Agency" into the
FISA legislation, the NSA has skillfully excluded from the coverage of the
FISA statute as well as the surveillance court all interceptions received
from the British GCHQ or any other non-NSA source.
Thus it is possible for GCHQ to monitor the necessary domestic circuits  and pass them on to the NSA through the UKUSA Agreement, giving them
impunity to target and watch-list Americans.
P475-477: Like an ever-widening sinkhole, the NSA's surveillance technology
will continue to expand, quietly pulling in more and more communications and
gradually eliminating more and more privacy.
If there are defenses to such technotyranny, it would appear, at least from
past experience, that they will not come from Congress.
Rather, they will most likely come from academe and industry in the form of
secure cryptographic applications to private and commercial telecommunications
The same technology that is used against free speech can be used
to protect it, for without protection the future may be grim.
Senator Frank Church, chairman of the Senate Intelligence committee, referring
to the NSA's SIGINT technology, ciirca 1975:
    At the same time, that capability at any time could be turned around
    on the American people and no American would have any privacy left,
    such is the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations,
    telegrams, it doesn't matter.
    There would be no place to hide.
    If the government ever became a tyranny, if a dictator ever took charge
    in this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence commun-
    ity has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny,
    and there would be no way to fight back, because the most careful effort
    to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how
    privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know.
    Such is the capability of this technology...
    I don't want to see this country ever go across the bridge.
    I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and
    we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this
    technology operate within the law and under proper supervision, so that
    we never cross over that abyss.
    That is the abyss from which there is no return.

#   "Moynihan Says U.S. Killed His Anti-Spy Measure"

#   Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan charged that the CIA and State Department

#   The Senator's bill would have made telephone call interception by foreign

That would appear to be this post:

What public or private key was used?
What key...?
Sparky got it wrong.
Many people could have the same public/secret key pairs, all they
have to do is give them out.
And you don't authenticate messages with the "secret key" in standard use.
This person seems to have no clue, after months of tracking, how
basic public key encryption software works.
In fact, the key ring could be edited to have a fake secret key
and the public key that works as the digital signature for the
posted message.
More questions: did they get the passphrase for his computer's
PGP secret key? How? And why did RCMP customs seize his computer?

Normally, an announcement of 128-bit crypto capabilities for a
home computer would mean the user has control of said crypto.

Can WebTV send end-to-end encrypted email to any other Net user?
The press release claiming WebTV has 128-bit security

#   #   Clearly, a balance must be struck between the needs of businesses and
#   consumers and the protection of society as a whole. What is the
#   answer? We believe the answer lies in cryptographic systems that
#   provide trustworthy security services along with lawful access. By
#   lawful access, I refer to a range of technologies designed to permit
#   the plain text recovery of encrypted data and communications under a
                   ^^^^^^^^
#   court order or other lawful means that safeguards civil liberties.
In other words, they believe in cryptographic systems with backdoor access.
The NSA testified to Congress concerning lawful access:
: The Puzzle Palace :     Inside the National Security Agency,
:     America's most secret intelligence organization
: Author James Bamford, 1983 revision, ISBN 0-14-00.6748-5
: P381-382: NSA Director General Allen testified to Congress that there is no
: statute that prevents the NSA from interception of domestic communications.
: Asked whether he was concerned about the legality of expanding greatly its
: targeting of American citizens, the NSA replied: "Legality? That particular
: aspect didn't enter into the discussions."
The government's idea of "lawful access" is "anywhere, anytime".
#   #   We are not wedded to any single technology approach. Key management
#   infrastructures, key recovery and other recoverable products that
#   provide lawful access are some of the ways to achieve a reasonable
#   balance. We believe that seeking industry-led, market-based solutions
#   is the best approach to helping law enforcement.

***** Companies Create New Crypto Back Door Hewlett-Packard and Wave Systems announced Tuesday that they have
developed a new programmable chip that can be adjusted to match
prevailing encryption policies. This system will only allow a computer
to encrypt data to the maximum level that local regulations allow. The
new program, called EMBASSY, must be registered with a "designated local
authority", who will activate the cryptography application.
The companies behind EMBASSY are hoping that the program will meet the new Department of Commerce encryption export standards, which currently
place a 56-bit limit on exported software applications. While 90 percent
of countries have no domestic-use policies, the program allows law
enforcement agencies that mandate key recovery features, such as France,
to be able to obtain access to a user's encrypted files under certain
circumstances. Several countries, including the UK, Germany, France, Denmark, Japan and Australia have already approved the technology. The
US will not issue export license until they are certain that the
recovery elements have been tested.
Privacy advocates were critical of EMBASSY. Jim Gilmore, co-founder of
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, expressed concern that the
cooperation of Hewlett-Packard and Wave Systems with the government may
lead to more surreptitious features being included into the program.
"What other black boxes have they put in this chip? Keystroke
monitoring? Recording traffic across the bus?" asked Gilmore. "If
they're giving you a black box, who's to say what other capabilities are
actually in that chip?"

But I've begun netcopping the Ignition-Point list on

Pobox.com/listbox.com is reluctantly assigning a person

But, when sites get smarter about using server-side includes,
the I/O delays will still be there.
I think ISPs should offer a proxy service for WWW access. They have
bigger pipes.
This could include an opt-in (configure through an ISP-local WWW page)
adbuster. At the same time, it would to a certain extent anonymize
And let's say cable-modem access becomes wide-spread, and legislation
forces the cable companies to allow ISP choice. I think ISPs that offer
some privacy in user access over this shared medium will have a leg-up
on their competition.
That would involve software residing local to the user's box that
would encrypt access between them and the ISP for WWW, email, ftp, etc.
More than just ssh.
Hey, then you would finally have ads that make clear what encryption
is for the average user: picture two neighbors going to work in the
morning meeting in the elevator, and one starts hinting he knows
what the other was receiving for email, which sites he was surfing...
Maybe the Anonymizer.com people will release/sell such software for ISPs,
and, of course, sans GAK.

I guess that qualifies as a request for more color.
In the local Panix Usenet groups, I've reposted quite a few whole articles,
often from the IP list.
Finally, a couple people made a stink, and officially complained to Panix.
:   Okay, I've been tolerating this for a long time, but:  this is a
:   violation of both Federal and international law. Post URLs, not articles.
My inelegant response:
    Eat me.
The local posters kept applying pressure:
:   But beyond whatever legal consequences this may entail for you
:   personally, I wonder what consequences it could conceivably entail for
:   panix.  Posting copyrighted material to general Usenet newsgroups is
:   one thing -- panix's staff could reasonably claim that they cannot
:   monitor or filter every Usenet newsgroup.  But they could not
:   reasonably make that argument about the local panix newsgroups.
The thread grew full of legal claims, and Panix consulted with lawyers.
In the following post by the owner of Panix, the references
to "sections 1,3,4" are from the IP list's fair use declaration

#   Organization: PANIX Public Access Internet and Unix, NYC
#   #   #   This message is in response to the discussion/flamewar in several groups
#   over the posting of copyrighted material by guy Please read it,
#   think about it, read it again, and think again before posting in response.
#   This is a pretty nasty subject.
#   #   In the wake of the postings and complaints to staff about guy's postings,
#   I consulted with two lawyers about this issue. One was a BLM, and the other
#   is a BLM and RIPE too. (Those are extremely technical acronyms for Brilliant
#   Legal Mind and Recognized Intellectual Property Expert. :-)
#   #   [snip]
#   #   I'm not going to go into the details much, because IANAL. But in short,
#   here's the answer: Fair use is a VERY fuzzily-defined concept, not in
#   principle where it's stated clearly in the law (as quoted here several
#   times recently), but in practice, where the courts try to interpret it.
#   Guy's claim for fair use could easily be correct, according to the BLMs,
#   because it may well qualify under sections 1, 3, and 4. I didn't think
#   so, but then again, I'm not a BLM, much less a RIPE. It would be a truly
#   terrible idea for us to take action, given the reasonable possibility that
#   there is no violation.
#   #   It was also pointed out to me that Panix can not act against Guy's posts
#   without threatening its own position in any future case that might hinge
#   on whether Panix were an Editor of panix group contents. This might or
#   might not be the case were someone to start posting large quantities of
#   commercial software, but the two cases aren't similar, since guy's
#   postings aren't obvious and uncontestable violations.
#   #   In any event, the BLMs' opinion was that I should very definitely leave
#   guy alone. This ruling extends to the one or two others that occasionally
#   post copyrighted material of similar nature, including one of Panix's staff.
#   #   Of course, were the volume of such posts to rise substantially, things might
#   be different. So this should not be seen as an invitation for all Panixians
#   to start posting their favorite copyrighted material here on a regular
#   basis.
#   #   Lastly: In an ideal world, everyone would learn from this and leave the
#   topic, wiser if sadder. In this less-than-ideal world, if you really want
#   to post a followup, I suggest that you consult a lawyer. If I hadn't, I'd
#   surely have stuck my foot in my mouth all the way up to my knee the first
#   time I posted about this topic.
#   #   /a
So, I was allowed to continue posting whole articles.
That's what the lawyers advised.
Then, the Digital Copyright Massive Federal Interference Act...
I chose the IP list as the next-level test case...

state Capitol on Friday, but temporarily lost when it flew out of a bomb
squad trailer.
A KSTP-TV helicopter was following the bomb squad van as it drove off
towing a trailer containing the suspicious package. The station was
taping as the package flew out of the open trailer in the wind and
at least three cars ran over it.
It took police about an hour to find the remains in the highway median.
Some 200 employees, including Gov.-elect Jesse Ventura, were forced to leave

Ugh, um, ...but he was a nutter, unlike me. ;-)
The other half of the reason I chose the IP list is because
of my dislike of its owner, nutter Michele Moore.
She is trying to profit from a book claiming various government agencies
knew full well the OK Murrah building was going to be blown up, and
purposely did nothing. Trying to profit from other's misery.
(At least my nutter anti-ECHELON "Cryptography Manifesto" is free.)
She also terminated my list subscription when I made a single post
asking for people not to make homophobic posts. She was 100% unforgiving
on this, even though I promised not to make such a post again. She
described the homophobic posts as "Christian". (This was around the time
Pat Robertson made comments about Florida's Disney being hit by God with
hurricanes because of its "gay days" promotion.)
It's also a very high-volume list, and I recently asked her about
posting about car antennas...
