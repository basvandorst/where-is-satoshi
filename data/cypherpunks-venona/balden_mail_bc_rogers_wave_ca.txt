I don't suppose the instinctive avoidance of security by obscurity
(validated by many problems in the past, especially the Enigma cipher used
by the Wehrmacht) has penetrated the great cryptographic minds o Meganet?

Are you looking for access to the MISTY source code? It's still illegal to
export it pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Even if that appeal
fails, Congress will likely pass amended laws and/or the NSA/Commerce Dept
will issue revised regulations on the same day that an unfavourable decision
is announced.
Those guys just never learn that not only is the barn door open, but that
contents were never theirs to begin with.

Exportability rules are based up the notion that the USA has the best
technology (perhaps true) and that non-Americans, such as the notorious
Chinese, are too far behind.
Whereas the truth is that many countries in the have the necessary
technology and have possessed it for a long time.  There is absolutely no
evidence that the US gov't crypto export rules are impeding drug cartels in
the least.
So there is a peverse mix cognitive dissonance, xenophobia ("what do those
chinks know anyway?!!), and sycophantism (telling the President what he
wants to hear).
Somebody please tell me how this idiocy can persist.

And whether the constitution so narrowly construed limits the action of
local councils. It would be extremely convenient if each fo the 50 states
adopted by custom each of the federal amendements mutatis mutandis.
However, freedom of expression in the US and elsewhere is mostly a limited,
but useful fiction.
While many have doubts about where strict freedom of speach should exist,
evidence is that is exists so long as the EFFECT of abberrent speech isn't
too disruptive to the established economic order.  So, for instance, using
the first amendment to tolerate pornographic works and such is against the
putative moral code of most Americans ca. 1950, but tolerating it didn't
really threaten any of the power elite.
Similarly, when the Civil Rights Act gave aggressive enforcement powers for
rights already guaranteed by the consitution, this meant that the power
elite was finally moved to act by massive pressure. Although social
conditioning may have taught southern white businessmen to look down on
negros, they knew that the negro economic power even at the time was very
America (and Canada, where this is been written from) are physically large
enough to have physically separated and opposed elite from different regions
who duke it out in Congress/Parliament.
So if you want the right to use strong encryption, or don't want CDA II to
ruin your life, appealing to the Constitution is not what I recommend.  If
people dislike porn enough, they'll **amend the constitution** if that's
what it takes.

At that time, snail mail was pretty safe even from the spooks (with certain
precautions). So what's your point?  If the military-industrial complex
wants to ruin your life, it's the guns and fences and dogs that ultimately
tell the story, cause your unbreakable cipher to be compromised yourself
under truth drugs, etc.  The bureaucractic mess surrounding key recovery
would probably make most spooks look for much more low-tech methods of
compromising your security.

Having travelled in China extensively, I can tell you that there is not a
great deal of "Communism", the way Marx, Lenin, Stalin, or even Mao might
have imagined it.
Historians of WWI will recall that US domestic politics included a faction
that maintained that the two oceans were a natural protection against
overseas aggressors and so involvement in the European war seemed pointless.
Such people were called "isolationists", even though they were simply
maintaining that the US simply **was** isolated.
Anyway, China has had the Himalayas and huge deserts and the Pacific to
protect it and was the same way.  When technology changed that, all sorts of
foreigners moved in.  By the time the twentieth century arrived, Chinese
were sick of foreign influence, and successive governments, Imperial (Qing
dynasty), Guomentang (National People's Party = KMT), CPC (Communist Party
of China),  tried to kick everybody out.  Mao's communism was, among other
things, better organized, and at least kicked the Japanese, and later the
Russians, out, making them great heros to the Chinese people for this alone.
But now, after the Great Leap Forward, and other adventures, Chinese people
including those within the Communist Party, have little more patience for
State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), the core of communism, are being
systematically privatized, with a final result expected to resemble modern
Britain c. 1975 (before Thatcher), and they are engaging in extensive joint
ventures with foreign firms.
China can't drop the word "Communist" easily for political reasons, but
"socialism with capitalist characteristics" is not readily distinguishable
from Tony Blair's species of moderate European socialism.
Similarly, the U.S. cannot admit directly that most of the Cold War military
spending was essentially a form of disguised Keynsian economics, and that
Grumman and friends were essentially state-subsidized if not state-owned ent
erprises.  Eisenhower figured out but few others did.
