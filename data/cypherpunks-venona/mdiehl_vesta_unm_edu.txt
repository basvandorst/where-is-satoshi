@_subject: People's rights???? 
This isn't actually, crypto-related, but it does relate to privacy. The other day, I was watching COPS on TV. (No flames, please)  They showed a
segment where the LEA had received complaints about the conditions in which
some children were living.  They were poor and living in a trailer.  So the
cop knocks on the door and the father answers.  THE COP STEPS INSIDE, SAYS,
"WE'VE HAD SOME COMPLAINTS.....AND I NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AROUND!"  The cop
then went through the people's living quarters!  Then the cop decided that
he was a child-care expert and that the conditions were not fit for the
children to live in.  SO THE COP TOOK THE CHILDREN AWAY.
     Now this scares the shit out of me.  Did this cop have the right to
just walk in and search the place based on a complaint?  Why didn't the man
know to ask for a warrent?  Was this cop trained as a social worker?  Is it
now possible to be so poor that the stat won't let you keep your children? Now don't get me wrong, I'm not a weep-for-the-poor-liberal; I'm very
conservative.  But don't these poor people have rights?       Does anyone know if there is a news-list devoted to people's rights? Thanx for letting me vent my rage!  Laters

@_subject: Pgp help. 
Hi all!  I've got YAPP (Yet Another Pgp Problem!) I want to know how
people are signing their messages and keeping the message in plaintext.  I
see the message and the pgp sig on the end.  Could someone outline how this
is done so I can implement it in my mailing system.  BTW, I sure like being
able to compose email in WordPerfect.... ;^)

@_subject: Key Signing Policy. 
Well, I got a lot of good discussion about when to sign someone's key. I have since come up with my own policy on when I will sign a key. Actually, I plagarized much of it from the many good responses I received. If anyone looks at my policy, recognizes their words and objects, please
tell me.  Otherwise, after about 10 days, I will make my statement a matter
of public domain.  Also, If you have any comments/questions/additions to my
statement, please tell me  I hope this will help clear up some of the
confusion reguarding when to sign someone's key.  Laters.
BTW, what do you think of my new sig?

According to Morgan Davis:
Orwell never said 1984.  He said 1994.  If your version says anything else, you
have an unofficial version which needs to be returned to The Ministry of Truth.

According to Peter Wayner:
Can this be documented?  If so, this would be the most convincing arguement
against the Big Brother chip.  References anybody?  Thanx.
