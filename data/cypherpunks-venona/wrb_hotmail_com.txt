Me and my friends are so lonely!! I wish that you would come and see me. With Valentines day coming I don't want to be alone. I will do anything to make you happy, if you want me to I'll even invite a friend over to join us.  Just PLEASE don't let me be alone!  I'll be awaiting for you every night.
