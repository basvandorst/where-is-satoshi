This PKP announcement is the last straw.  This is clearly a case of the
federal policy/procurement bureaucracy going completely out of control.
The way things ran under Bush, except if they tried to pull this blatant
a deal their bluff would have been called immediately.  I think it's time to demand the White House put a total moratorium on
all policies related to digital and telecommunications data and privacy
until they can extract themselves from this quicksand.
And if they won't do that, it's time to kick some *serious* political butt.
Don't you let that deal go down!

Feh on Pournelle and Niven especially, dreary drones of the Ayn Rand school

Right.  Contracts and licensing arrangements can last much longer
than patents.
That's why it's so important to see the exact details of this latest
deal and find out why someone in the federal bureaucracy was greasing
the procurement skids.

I beg to differ.  I know about federal procurement regs a little,
having been employed by a federal contractor for a decade and being
one my own personal self now.  They greased this process bigtime, and
it has the ugly smell of politics all over it.

Tim May and Phil Karn's comments remind me of my friend Mark the Lawyer
who lives in SF.  I visit him on occasion when I'm in the Bay Area and
notice that he has the proper perspective on things.  When I was there
a week ago he had a copy of the Nolo Press newspaper (including a hefty
selection of their vast catalogue of lawyer jokes).  And his refrigerator
magnet reads: "Lawyer: person retained to protect client from others of

our nation's capital that seems excessive.

Thanks for posting that, John.  I don't think I particularly want to
ask ONE of my Senators (Packwood) about this, since as far as I am
concerned he is a shame to the nation and my state.  But I will ask
the other one -- Hatfield -- to vote against this nomination.  In
general, I am against career military and/or intelligence operatives
from being Secretary of Defense, because it is important to retain
at least a semblance of civilian control.  (Of course, the way things
really work, it might not make that much difference.  But appearances
*do* matter, and I care deeply about small-d democratic civilian control
of our national government and its agencies.)
Hatfield is no particular friend of the military-industrial complex
(although not especially an opponent either), so it may be possible
to find someone on his staff who is interested in pursuing the *real*
Bobby Ray Inman story.

While Mike may indeed be correct about the incremental effectiveness
of using PGP *at this time*, I think Eric's point is the more important --
that as a leading organization promoting electronic privacy and access,
EFF ought to set an example, one positive offshoot of which might be
an *improvement* in EFF's communication effectiveness since the spoofing
issue can be dealt with so much more easily.
This is really a wake-up call to all of us, I think.  I've had PGP
sitting around on the shelf for a while now, and I'm not using it . . .
yet.  But that's going to change.
If *we* don't take advantage of these tools now, in effect defining their
use and showing their benefits, then who will?  Those who lobby and advocate on behalf of these tools and approaches ought
to have direct experience with them.  It will make our efforts more
authentically based on experience and thus more effective.

I'm following the unfolding tale with interest.  The document itself
is trivial and looks like a thousand others throughout the government
(and in the private sector too, particularly in the Beltway Bandits
who service the 'national security' establishment).  But what is
interesting is the response from the throne room when the peasantry
dares point out that the King of Encryption has no clothes.

I suggest you take Sudaplatov with a LARGE grain of salt.  The memoirs
of ex-spies are replete with self-serving truths, important omissions
and deliberate misinterpretations to meet political goals.  Don't forget the 'security' establishments on both sides of the Former
Cold War have scores to settle, clients to stroke and budgets to fill.
Ask yourself this: why should he tell the truth *now*, and how much is
he likely to tell?  In regard to Oppenheimer and the like, I suggest treating all observations
with care.  Remember that the national security state apparatus starting
growing in earnest after World War II but suspicion of foreign influence
goes back to the labor movement of the 1870s, and the art of the smear
was perfected certainly by the time of the Palmer Raids about 1920.
My very limited knowledge of Oppenheimer and others of that era is that
it is highly unlikely they provided much of strategic value to the
Russians.  Otherwise incidental contact at the political or scientific
levels was used effectively after World War II to destroy careers on
both sides of the Iron Curtain (re-read Darkness At Noon for the mirror
image).  If I may summarize: the one thing we must learn from the last 100 years
is that the least trustworthy in our society are those we have deeded the
most trust (knowingly or not).  But then, it's hardly a new thing after all.  The Latin phrase says it most clearly:  Quis custodiet custodies?

Aside from the fact that Jim Nalbandian is wrong about the absolutist
