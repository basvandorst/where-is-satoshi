Actually,  I just went through this.  I wanted scytale.net, but my ISP
rep was very upfront about my chances.  The .net is now reserved by
InterNIC for ISP's.  The .org domain is held for provable nonprofit
corps.  The .us domain was a possibility, but pragmatically impossible
due to the >4 month update latency in Minnesota.  Literally, the only
choice I had for a domain name was in the .com area.  It somewhat pissed

A little simplistic, perhaps, but nevertheless accurate.  800 and 900
numbers do not receive CNID (Calling Number ID).  They receive ANI
(Automatic Number Identification).  In the case of 800 (or 888) numbers,
they're paying for the call.  For 900's, you're paying a premium charge.
In both cases, the calling number is delivered for billing purposes.
This isn't new... ANI has been around for years.
Speak for yourself.  I have CNID, and I find it to be damn useful in

that the liberal money-throwers are unlikely to ever see their
"benevolence" produce a good result, even if said benevolence _could_
produce improvements.  And while offering up the public teat may help in
certain limited and individual cases, it generally only weakens the

Unwanted physical mail doesn't cost me money to receive.  Unwanted

IANAL, but at least one interpretation I've read finds a computer, modem and

"continuing, persistent, and extensive", given that the messages persist
in the face of no less than 8 demands that they cease.

harrassing email, and include dates and message id's.  I'm not invoicing

My point is that I, as a member of the public, should not be restricted
in *my* choices.  Just as gun control laws make it harder for me to
lawfully purchase and own a gun, your proposal makes it harder for me to
lawfully obtain strong cryptography.  The obvious difference is that
guns are capable of inflicting fatal damage to humans, where
cryptography is not.
And it also makes me more vulnerable.  You are asking me to compromise
my own security because some other person might abuse his own
capability.  Will you also ask that I allow my muscles to atrophy to the
point where I cannot inflict damage with a blow from my fist, because
others might decide to fight?
It is important to remember that cryptography is 100% defensive.  It
_cannot_ be used in an offensive manner.  Any plan to weaken or restrict
cryptography is a plan to disallow defenses.  How can you ask me to
leave myself vulnerable to attackers?
Repressive states will endeavor not to allow connectivity with
non-repressive states.  Your plan only facilitates the repressors.
Thus, you offer weapons of repression to governments.

It's an MS-DOS limit.  The filesystem only can store a file 2^31 bytes
long, because the it stores the file size as a 32 bit signed integer.
What's interesting is that his stated limit is 258 bytes less than the
maximum file size, and his stated maximum key size is 256 bytes.  Makes
a guy wonder just what's in that 258 byte header.

In Minneapolis and Anchorage (the two cities of which I have knowledge)
mail carriers have a key that opens not only apartment-style mailboxes,
but little boxes on the outside of apartment buildings that hold a key
to the building's lobby.  Snag one of those keys and a large portion of
the city opens its doors to you.  (some buildings have further locked
doors beyond the mailbox lobby to counter this threat)

FWIW, I gate all my subscribed mailing lists to local newsgroups because
my newsreading tools are much better than my mailreading tools.
The unfiltered list already had spammers and flamers.  Would you expect
nore sewage, different sewage or a combination?

Cauzin was bought by Eastman Kodak shortly after they started
advertising in the big rags (like _Byte_, which printed a test strip a
month or so before Cauzin made their big advertising push).  Cauzin was
even putting freeware programs in their ads.  At that time, Kodak was
just entering the soon-to-be-lucrative magnetic media market with their
floppy disk line.  I'd say they were bought and buried.

Concur.  When I went after my domain name last year, I was effectively
forced into taking a .com, which was the _last_ TLD I wanted.  (first
choice was .net, but that's supposedly now only given to ISPs)  I'd
happily accept scytale.nom, especially since it's doubly cryptic.

I much prefer the plan where a potential mail correspondant includes an
e-cash dollar directly cashable by me.  If I like the mail (and the
sender), I throw the dollar away and the sender goes on the approved
list.  If not, I keep the dollar, and the sender goes on the twit list.
Paper junk mail costs an advertiser more than $1 per piece, so they'd
still be getting a bargain.  And potentially, some receivers may throw
away the dollar and welcome the spam.
It should also spur development of intelligent agents which can retrieve
this cash without human intervention.  Spammers will doubtless alter
their pages to require more interaction to find the key to the cash.
Then the IA's will be improved.  Then... remember the copy protection
wars?  This isn't necessarily a negative point.
Or that the money wasn't there in the first place (absent a trusted
signature system), or the key doesn't exist, or the wrong key is
offered, or the sender put the same e-dollar on all 60000 mails sie
sent and it's already been redeemed.

The 1st one begins with "Congress shall make no law", and that's quite
enough.  The US government is forbidden to interfere in matters of
speech. (yah, I know this doesn't seem to slow 'em down much) You're
right that a sendmail (or other process vulnerable to subversion) should
protect itself.  My fear is that our benevolent protectorate will
_require_ such precautions, because that concedes the duty to provide
other precautions as the law might require.
