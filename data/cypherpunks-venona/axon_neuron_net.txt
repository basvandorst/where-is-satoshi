@_subject: NSA and the NCSA/Apache web servers 
I was flipping through the Apache http Server Project's web site   when I came across the following note:
   Note: We were informed by NCSA that the NSA (The US National Security
   Agency - yes, the folks who in 1994 said "we're only 10 years    behind schedule")  considered the hooks to encryption in NCSA's httpd    to be in violation of the munitions export law, thereby making its    distribution to foreign sites illegal. For various reasons, we decided    to remove the -DPEM_AUTH code completely.
This was followed by a pointer to  from which the following text was taken:
   On May 17th, 1995, we were asked by a representative of NCSA to remove    any copies of NCSA httpd prior to 1.4.1 from our web site. They were    mandated by the NSA to inform us that redistribution of pre-1.4.1 code    violated the same laws that make distributing Phill Zimmerman's PGP    package to other countries illegal. There was no encryption in NCSA's
   httpd, only hooks to publicly available libraries of PEM code. By the    NSA's rules, even hooks to this type of application is illegal. Wow -- hooks to encryption are unexportable -- now THAT's bullshit.  Sheesh.
