@_subject: Failed Fail Report 
The enclosed fail report failed to reach it's intended recipient because of the
use of the unbracketed IP number.  HOWEVER, surely there should be a -request
address for cypherpunks to which should be in the Sender: field so that fail
reports go back to the list maintainer and not the originator of the article.
