a good idea.  what we really need to do is to obtain, by whatever means
seems available, a copy of "the briefing", and to publish it, on the web/net, with detail anotations of each point. having
their story in public view would certainly take away a lot of it's power.
also, on the off chance that there were any errors in their version of the facts, it could make for an interesting q&a session when the next
receiptent didn't buy the pitch.
ps.. no, i don't know, right off-hand, how to obtain such a copy, but if the employee manual that was making the rounds a few years was
what it porported to be, well, there's hope for this document to
see the light of day. (-:

FWIW, not even root can unmount a file system that is busy.

on tuesday, 3 dec at 2000 hrs, channel 13 (PBS) in the new york area will air
the Nova special, "The Codebreakers".  this isn't anything new, but, as i remember, it's worth watching again.

@_subject: DFA 
does anyone know what has happened to DFA, and the people who
just a few months ago were publishing such encouraging results?
have they gone underground, or perhaps been put underground, in a rather permanent way?
isn't it strange how quite it has been on this subject?
