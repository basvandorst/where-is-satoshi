This is a touchy topic!  It's a tough call, since statements like:
may be applied to MANY goverment activities:
* foreign policy (Iraq, Vietnam, Contras, lots of others)
* funding & the NEA
* environmentalist concerns
* homosexuals
* gambling - lots of debate here in TX about the state lottery.  Some
  found it unethical and immoral.  Same goes for the greyhound
  racetrack near Houston.  In the end, $$$$$$ won.
* our favorite: cryptography
I'll have to say, though I disagree with your virus position and am
saddened by the outcome, I don't see anything wrong with
"whistleblowing" in this manner.
This seem true.  Just a few months ago there was an enormous flap over
Julf's anonymous server.  But then, like now, the issue was really
over statements made and actions taken anonymously.  However,
anonymity became the focal point.
