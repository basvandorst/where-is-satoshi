Do you have sources for this information?  MOSS is out there at least as a Internet Draft, and possibly further along, and Steve Dorner of Qualcomm, the original author of Eudora, is pretty active in the MIME community and I doubt he would support a second MIME type to do the same thing...

The detailed discussions of planning such a port probably are inappropriate for cypherpunks.  Lord knows we need to conserve space for Foster conspiracy I think a seperate list might not be a bad idea.  Either on your server or on something like vger.rutgers.edu, which is pretty much the linux mailing center of the universe right now. :-)
We should probably also check on comp.os.linux.networking and linux-net to make sure someone isn't already working on this.
The ideal author would be outside the US, since the patches would need to be mailed to Linus for inclusion in the kernel, and that brings up some interesting ITAR issues.

The fact that it uses exactly 5 *'s, and the MACB E command below indicate this was probably an Anarchie transcript, a ftp/archie client for the Mac.
Too bad "Anonymous" isn't more aware of the FTP protocol.  This indicates that the connection was made from 199.117.100.36, p36.Boulder-2.dialup.csn.net.
This indicates "Anonymous" is either making up everything from this point on, or has access to the machine other than normal anonymous FTP.  The permissions on dist would prevent the CWD from happening.  Actually, the permissions on dist prevent this from working at all.
Look, if you want to make PGPfone available overseas in violation of ITAR, go ahead.  It's a stupid law, and you aren't likely to get caught.  But don't make MIT or Phil the fall guy for it.  Send it out yourself.  MIT and Phil have contributed greatly to the privacy community, and stupid stunts like this aren't going to encourage them much.

You appear to be correct.  I came in from a .net address, which MIT apparently feels is non-US, and they would be correct about some .net's, but that's true of .com and .edu as well.
I came in from a Multinational corporation in .com, and it let me in. :-)
But if people get it from MIT directly, then MIT is violating ITAR/DTR, and its lawyers would be justified in shutting things down.  If it's pulled down by a US citizen, and then sent out, I don't see how MIT could be held responsible for it.

RSA will give out certificates to individuals; Apple includes a coupon for a free one with their MacOS 7.5 (and 7 Pro) release.  There's a program for the Mac (RIPEM Mac) that will convert the keys returned into RIPEM usable PEM-format keys.  Isn't that what SSL uses?
The only question is what CAs are supported by the browser....  I think the Apple keys are under RSA's Unaffiliated User CA...
If there's interest, I'll look further into this.

Ethical I would definately agree with.
Legally, I'm not so sure of. The applicable law would appear to be the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. The law does allow administrators to see messages in the normal course of their job, as long as they don't reveal that information to a 3rd party (except law enforcement in the event of a criminal act)
This protection is probably strongest with a company you purchase Internet Service from, probably lesser so with a University, since there is less obviously a customer/seller relationship, and almost non-existant with a business, since there isn't a customer relationship, and the systems are owner by the business.

jsw said:
For UNIX, including the environment is pretty useless for determining a seed. On BSD-style machines, try a ps -uxeww. The environment is known by anyone who has access to the machine when the seed is generated, and possibly to many others, since some machines have SNMP daemons that will give out the process table, or may have the systat "service" turned on.
The later two may not include the environment on most machines, but I believe it concievably could, and may be implimentation specific from UNIX to UNIX.
I greatly applaud Netscape for "going public" with this information, and remaining open to suggestions despite the bad publicity it has been getting. One of the large corporations I work with is looking to do an electronic commerce with some pretty amazing $ amounts soon (at least, amazing to me), and I know I'm going to be asked about the security breaks. I feel confident that I can tell them exactly what is wrong, and what Netscape is doing to fix it, and that I don't think it should be a matter for great concern. I'm not sure I could have done that had Netscape done nothing but issue the press release and weather the bad press in silence.

khijol!erc said:
I don't think any of us disagree with that. I think what we disagree about is getting Netscape to accept our revenue. :-) I've tried calling and emailing to buy a copy of Linux, and the answer was always, "It's not available for Linux." Despite what's on their FTP server.
I mostly want the stronger crypto in the US only version, but Netscape has said they are trying to make that available for FTP, so I can wait. I also want Java, but no one has that yet, and they 2.0 will probably be available for Linux, so I can wait for that too.

Depends on how Netscape impliments Java. Under HotJava it could concievably be done, although Security setting may restrict the browser from doing SMTP...
Actually, I would suspect it might be possible to do using forms, using a mailto: form.  Hmmmmmmmm.......

Here's something that might be of interest.....
Precedence: bulk
I've just finished integrating PGP into Majordomo 1.93.  I would like some
feedback on it's ease of use, functionality etc, so I may improve it before
releasing the code to the Public.  And there's always that doco thing...
Should be ready by months end.
If secure 'domo administration or secure distribution is of interest to you,
send the following commands in an email body to Majordomo
        help            <-- not the usual stuff.  better read it.
        info pgptest
        info pgpdomo-announce
If you are a PGP user, please subscribe to pgptest  This is
a PGP protected test list that needs a workout.  I'll spew pieces of my code
to pgptest for people to review.
Any comments, bug reports, oversights, anything (except money), please forward
to phollins

fc said:
They can. Maybe not from you, but people were poking holes in Netscape before *anything* was offered. Greed isn't the sole motivator of people.
A bit too mercenary-like for my tastes, and a bit lacking in ethics. Tracking down security holes and selling them to the highest bidder without giving details to all doesn't just hurt Netscape.
This sounds like a better idea. And it isn't mutually exclusive with the "Bugs Bounty" or T-shirts.
From what I recall, Netscape has hired decent programmers. I don't know about their internal business practices. From what I've seen, though, they have the right attittude about fixing security, rather than sweeping it under the rug and suing people who alledge security faults. Certainly their release of their PRNG code is proof of that.
