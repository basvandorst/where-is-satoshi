Might be a bit of a stretch, but I think this is because money today is inherently a liability, that is a debt that someone, somewhere has promised to pay back.  Such is the nature of fractional reserve banking and debt-based currencies under which the international financial system Thus if the origin of the money (the indebted party) is obscured, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage the quality of the world's money supply.  After all, how can the issuer of the money collect on the debt that ultimately backs it when the issuer has no idea who to collect the debt from?  Take away the ability to manage debt effectively and the issuer's money quickly becomes worthless (be it a commercial bank issuing deposit currency as a loan to its customers or a government's central bank issuing cash currency to its citizens based on a debt placed upon future generations of citizens).
A money's value is measured by the quality of debt backing it.  If the debt is defaulted on (whether through obscurity, Chapter 11, etcetera), the money loses value, which in turn can have negative systemic repercussions throughout the world's financial markets.  The recent Asian currency devaluations (South Korea in particular) and the accompanying financial woes are a good example of what happens when the debt quality of money devalues.
