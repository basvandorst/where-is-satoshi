Not hard to implement things like this.  With the current non-cryptoized
moderation system, anybody can post to a moderated group by putting an
"Approved:" header line on their article.  And articles can be cancelled by
anyone who wants to forge an cancel, so articles with forged approvals can
be cancelmoosed away if people want.  You could set up a cancelbot that trashes
any article that doesn't have the magic words from the FAQ
        Approved: Squeamish Ossifrage
in the header, or doesn't have the right digital signature in the approvals,
where you've only given teh keys to the Moderation Cabal.
Or, for a system where mail has to go to a moderator first, similar to the
current mail-to-moderator posting method, you could set up a mail-pool for
the moderator's address, that sends each article out to 1..N of the moderators
(e.g. to whoever's on duty today, or everybody, or a random k of the
moderators for
load-sharing), who could then post them.
If you want a mailing-list approach, they're easier - just send your mailing
through procmail on the mailhost, and set it up to accept/reject/etc. whoever
your list policy wants.
If somebody comes out with D News, the crypto-cancel-based system,
it can use a digital signature system like RIPEM-SIG (which is exportable)
or some equivalent we can build out of PGP after the PGP 3.0 toolkit
becomes available.

@_subject: Re: Mr. Newbie... 
The documentation that comes with PGP isn't bad; read the pgpdoc1 and
pgpdoc2 files.
(If you buy ViaCrypt, you get them in nice spiral-bound manuals, but it's
the same stuff.)  Here's an overview of the basics:
- RSA public-key encryption lets you create a public encryption key which you
can publish, so that other people can encrypt files that can only be decrypted
with your private key.  It also lets you sign files by decrypting them with your
private key, which other people can check by encrypting with your public key
to get the original message (or a hash of it) back.  What makes this
cool is that it does it in a way that takes exponentially long amounts of time
to find your private key from the public key, so anybody who wants to crack
a reasonably
long key needs to run a big hairy computer for about the age of the planet
to do so,
but you can do decryption reasonably fast because you already know the
private key,
and the same algorithm works well for both encryption and digital signatures.
- RSA encryption isn't very fast, so most real programs that use it encrypt the
file with a conventional crypto algorithm (PGP uses IDEA) using a randomly
session key, and encrypt the session key with RSA; it's a lot faster.
- The problem with public-key encryption is that anybody who wants to send
you a message needs to be sure they've really got _your_ public key instead
of a key that some Bad Guy published saying "Here's Alice's public key -
trust me!".
Since RSA can do digital signatures, PGP uses them to create a "Web of Trust",
where you can sign a message saying "Here is Alice's key, signed Bob",
and anybody who's got a good copy of your key (and trusts you) will know they've
got a good copy of Alice's key.  If they didn't get a copy of your key directly
from you, they may have a message saying "Here's Bob's key, signed Carol",
or maybe they got that and Carol's key, signed by Dave, and they know Dave
personally so they've checked it with him.  How big a Web of Trust can you
Well, you probably need more security if you're running a revolution than if
you're trying to find out if a Usenet article is genuine or bogus, so PGP lets
you choose, but the default is 4 levels deep.
- OK, so how do you get PGP? - there's an occasional publication on the net
that tells you where, but you can get it from ftp.ox.ac.uk by ftp with no
Inside the US, you want version 2.6.2 for non-commercial use, and you have
to buy
ViaCrypt's licensed version if you want to sell services using it.  Outside
the US,
the version's something like 2.6.2i or something ending in i.  3.0 will be out
"Real Soon Now", probably in 1995, but it's hard work.  Versions are available
for DOS, Mac, Unix, and a few less popular OSs.  ViaCrypt has a special
Windows version;
the rest of us Windows users can either run it from DOS or use a front-end
like Private Idaho (ftp.eskimo.com/joelm/) or WinPGP, available from popular
FTP sites.
If you're using the Unix version, it's assumed you know how to read readme files
and compile using Make; DOS folks get binary as well as source and
Unix folks will notice that the command line has this ugly DOS feel to it :-)
- So you've got it installed and you've read the documentation, and messed with
the config.txt file if you didn't like the default options, and now
you want to do something.  Type "pgp -h" to get help, or "pgp -k" to get help
with keys for a reminder.  Then type "pgp -kg" to generate a key - you
probably want a 768-bit or 1024-bit key for normal use, unless you're
paranoid or
have a slow computer.  Because RSA keys are long strings of binary data that
are hard for humans to remember, PGP stores them in a file, encypted with IDEA,
and will prompt you for a "passphrase" for the encryption.  Make it something
long and complicated enough to be secure, but easy for you to remember without
writing it in a yellow sticky-note, and not blatantly obvious.  You'll need to use it any time you decrypt a file somebody else sent you, or sign a file you're
sending to someone else.  You'll also need a name - typical format looks like
        Bob Dobbs which has your name and email address.  Most of the time you'll just use an
abbreviation and let pgp figure it out.  To send your key to someone else,
once you've generated it, type "pgp -kx Dobbs filename" and it'll create a file
you can mail somebody else which will let them encrypt stuff to you.
To decrypt a file you got from someone else, type "pgp filename",
which will do the right thing for decryption, checking signatures,
receiving new keys, etc.  To encrypt a file to someone else, type "pgp -e filename theirname" and pgp will create a file called filename.asc
(or filename.pgp if you don't have the ascii-armor option set, which you

True, though there have been more and louder calls for banning crypto as
it becomes more widely used, and as the Internet and electronic commerce
make its use more relevant.  The number of cats running around outside of bags
has been increasing, so the effort of the politicians to herd them back in
has become more and more noticeable.  A lot of it has been good public relations but the Good Guys as well -
back in the late 70s, when I started following it, crypto was mostly for spooks,
bankers, and academic math nerds*; PGP and the government's persecution of Phil
have made a lot of people aware that the stakes are high and the Bad Guys
are serious, and the Clipper Chip sounded enough like "The Feds want to tap my phone"
that the general public could understand, a bit, that this was something
that affected them...
It's also been technology - real crypto needs computers, and computers have
gone from million-dollar room-fillers that you might use at work or university
to appliances you can buy at WalMart, like tv sets, which your kids use for
if you don't count game machines, which your kids can buy at K-mart...
Suddenly a third of the country's got a machine they can do real crypto on,
and for 10 bucks a month they can be on a world-wide email network.
And it's mostly the _rich_ third of the country, who might want to do their
home banking somewhere a bit less taxing than before.
Oh, yeah, there's also drugs - folks might want to use the Home Shopping

Actually, it's less clear than that.  It's pretty clear what you can
do with ViaCrypt code; just read the license to see who can use it,
and you can send any kind of messages you want over it, even for money.
On the other hand, the definitions of "non-commercial use" for RSAREF and
IDEA are far less clear (and they're clearer for RSAREF than for IDEA,
and I got the impression from what I read somewhere on the net or in the PGP
that the initial permission from Ascom-Tech for use of IDEA with PGP was
pretty informal, and that they've been trying to tighten up what's covered.)
(Also RSAREF licenses have changed from version to version, and the
license PKP uses to distribute versions of RSAREF may also have changed?)
Selling software containing the code is pretty clearly commercial.
Non-commercial messages from your personal non-business machine are
clearly non-commercial.  Providing a service of encrypting and decrypting
messages for people for money sounds like it's _very_ probably commercial.
Encrypting and decrypting messages to/from your business that deal with money
are a very gray area.

@_subject: Re: Here it is; bi-directional dining cryptographers 
Context: Bidirectional DCnets, Alice and Bob simultaneously transmitting
to each other.  Interesting approach, though you do have to schedule it
somehow.  It's a different take on the uses of DCnets - the original
was for an anonymous-1 to many rather than a 1 to 1 with only the two
knowing, though in the first case the recipient can be known only to the sender
if they want to arrange things that way through shared secrets or whatever.
Presumably people will use multiple key-ids on the net as well - Alice may
have a general-use "Alice" key, and maybe also a general-use "Medusa" key,
but Alice or Medusa may have also arranged with Bob to use a different key
for traffic where he doesn't mind if she knows he sent it and he doesn't want
anyone else knowing it's being sent to her.  Also, he can do this anonymously,
so she doesn't know either:
        Alice posts Plaintext("Hi, I'm Alice, key AAAA")
        Bob   posts Encrypt(AAAA, "Hi, Alice, I'm Dr. X, Key XXXX, please
                        post a key I can use to talk to you")
        Alice posts Encrypt(XXXX, Signed(AAAA, "Hi, Dr. X, use key AXAX"))
Bob's message lets him send stuff to Alice without anyone, including her,
knowing it's from him, since the name X and key XXXX are new randoms.
Alice signs her response so Dr. X knows that key AXAX will really go to
Alice and
not to Mallet who's impersonating Alice; she doesn't really care who X is.
If traffic analysis is a concern (Alice noticing, for instance, that she's
getting a _lot_ of requests from key AXAX for her remailer to send stuff
to destination ZZZZ), Bob can keep sending her new requests for keys and ids,
and not reuse them more than he thinks is safe.
Since anybody can send bits at any time, and nobody can tell who without
lots of collusion, you can't prevent denial-of-service (well, I assume not,
unless there's something rather non-obvious in the literature.)
The Bad Guy can decide if it's more fun to jam the reservations or the messages.
What reservation does for you is gives a short inefficient period (with
possible collisions, backoff-and-retry, etc., depending on algorithm) that
you can use to reserve a longer one-user period for message traffic, so you can spend most
of your time talking instead of haggling over interruptions.
One way to do reservations is to use some variant on Slotted Aloha for the
reservation period - for example, everybody picks a random id number for the
(with odd parity or odd high-bit to make collision detection easier),
waits a random number of slots, and then sends their id number.
If there's a collision, wait and retry, maybe with exponential backoff.
After the first slot that's got data and looks like it doesn't have a collision,
anybody who thinks that it was their number picks a different number,
waits a short random number of slots and posts; first one wins.
(If you're using 32-bit randoms and have fewer than a million players, the chances of two undetected collisions in a row are really small,
even if people cheat a bit on their backoffs.)  Winner announces how many
slots he's going to use up for his message, so you know when to start again.

That's difficult - you have to identify that the sender is sending
the same message while the message is being sent, rather than
one or two bit-times later, and you can't fake encryption with an
unknown keyid or digital signatures.  (Digital signatures aren't
something everybody would use very often on a DC-net, since the purpose
of the net is to be anonymous, but since you can do anonymous broadcasts,
you can anonymously post a signature key for your nym if you want to.)
Also, there's no need to combine jamming and posting an offensive message;
they both work well separately.  I suppose you could do that if you only
want to harass the net a bit (e.g. replace all trafic to remailer X
with new remail to whitehouse.gov, or replace all postings from
Cancelmoose with complaints about censorship), but basically DCnets
degrade rapidly if the social structure of the net members does.

                to telnet to, like me) do need to know their limitations,
                and currently have the most problems with convenience,
                having to haul files back to a secure machine to encrypt
                The first step is education - manuals that say "Don't Panic
                Unless You Need To Be Paranoid" instead of "Panic Immediately",
                that can make them aware of the risks and tradeoffs.  It's about
                two pages of well-written stuff, if someone wants to write it.
                The next step is either building convenient tools to help
                them with encryption, or building convenient installation
                for the tools that already exist (e.g. mail, or scriptable
                terminal emulators which can automate a lot of the hauling
The big payoffs are for groups 1 and 2, but a lot of the technically savvy
who read manuals and have to convince system administrators to install stuff
are in group 3.  So this is basically a writing job, plus talking the PGP 3.0
people and maybe Phil into including the discussion with the manuals.
Remailers, btw, are in this class, since they need to leave their
passphrases out
in relatively unprotected shell scripts.
I used to run PGP on a diskless workstation (at least I was one
of the people with the root password :-), but I was aware of the risks.
I'm now using it both on my Netcom+Eudora+PrivateIdaho system and on the
machine where I have web space, which I have to telnet to across Netcom.
I take care of the trust problem there by using a short key with a big ugly
"untrustable" string in the user name, and using S/Key to log in;
if I had an encrypted telnet to run on both ends I'd probably want to use it,
so I'm watching the Stel and other new stuff coming out.

Hi!  I just saw that you'd be discussing the Exon Censorship Bill
discussion on today's Science Friday on Talk of The Nation; I found out
from a mailing list on the Internet, and had time to tune in,
but not enough advance warning to attack-dial and become the one lucky
caller who actually got on :-)
You picked a well-balanced set of interviewees; I was a bit disappointed
by the time balance between discussion and callers.  It would also be
nice if you extended the on-line discussion to the Internet as well as
the commercial services AOL and Compuserve, since that extends the collection
of people who can be involved in the discussion.
[Summary for list-folk - the speakers were Bruce Taylor of National Law Center
for Children and Families (sounds like a Pat Robertson thing), Dan Weitzner
of CDT,
and Larry Maggoth(sp?) who wrote the Child Safety on the Info Superhighway
Larry led off, Taylor dominated the discussions, Weitzner mostly wimped out.
Everybody agreed that there's obscenity on the Internet if you want to find it,
and that it's great that we have obscenity laws to punish Bad People and
Protect Kids;
Rimm's bogus numbers weren't discussed, the indecency-vs-obscenity was starting
to be discussed but got cut off by time.]

When you're building software to run portably across a variety of
operating systems with varying levels of multitaskability or brain-damage,
building a big monolith with good modularity inside seems a reasonable
and it means you don't have to do as much work to define interfaces that
talk to everybody else's cool application program.  Since URLs are designed
to let you point to just about anything, it's real nice if your browser client
can actually do something useful with any URL it finds.  I think that includes
sending mail in response to mailto:s (though not receiving it; that's really
Somebody Else's Problem), and at least popping up a crude newsreader to
read news: URLs.  It would certainly be nicer to have a system that's
aggressively tool-based with obvious interfaces chosen to call other
if the user configures them instead of the default app.  On Unix that's
usually easy
(fork/exec with some appropriate command-line args and popular data formats);
on Macs it's not too bad; on DOS, well, anyway.  Winsock at least means that
Windows applications have some chance of using the network compatibly at the
same time, which was previously a major annoyance; now it just makes it
harder to
use the _Microsoft_ clients along with Netscape and your other cool apps,

It's _not_ free after 1997!  I thought of it last fall, was surprised I couldn't
find it anywhere in the literature, given that it's pretty obvious,

"commutative hash functions", with g^X mod p as an example, so it's more

I developed it because I was looking for a way to do authentication-only
public key stuff so the code would be exportable - this approach doesn't
generate a shared secret (since the otherwise-secret g^XT is exposed
as the response to the challenge.)  However, it's possible to extend it to
preserve the shared secret - instead of sending response g^XY mod p, send
        Hash(g^XY mod p)
and have the login server validate that.  One advantage is that the hash
can be much shorter than the whole g^XY mod p, e.g. 32-64 bits instead of

The most current information on the Rosenbergs, gotten from decrypted Soviet

End-to-end is generally your problem, but for typical satellite phone

at best you might get a phone with digital passthrough of some sort,
so you can send raw bits without a modem.  Uplink and downlink encryption would be real nice, if the carrier provided them;
at best we'll probably see governments mandating access to session keys
(which the satellites could be equipped to provide), with commercial market needs forcing some kind of encryption to prevent eavesdropping (especially
on downlinks, of course.)  The limits aren't technical.
Call-control encryption is an interesting question - there'll certainly

Matt Ghio wrote (on cypherpunks):
I haven't actually compiled the code (it's not very DOS-friendly), but it looks
easily modified; some parts of the problem are still hard, such as identifying
the client to the server.  Some issues to deal with for adding authentication:
0) RSAREF2.0 would have been nice, and comes with D-H and DES.
1) The option negotiation is simple but hard-coded; it would be easy to add
one thing at a time, but would benefit from a more flexible option-negotiator.
That would also let you pretend it was just a general-purpose telnet-with-
various-processors and avoid ITAR restrictions for the
bones version, but the authors, not being Yankees, don't have to worry about
2) Authentication means that some process on each machine is willing to make
a digital signature using a private key - how do you store that key safely?
For a client operated by a human, that's not a big problem; for a server,
or a client operated by a program without a direct user-interface, it's harder.
Do you just leave the key in a file (trusting root?)  Do you only start the
server daemon by hand?  For most Unix applications, I suppose a root-read-only
file containing the key is OK, since if a cracker can read that file you've
got far more serious problems (and the cracker can take over your email anyway.)
3) One big difficulty in authentication systems is securely but conveniently
exchanging authentication parameters; you don't want to risk man-in-the-middle
by trusting keys you got from the other side (otherwise you could use plain
but getting keys from a keyserver is slow and hard to integrate, and
requiring the other side to already have your key parameters limits your
usefulness.  3A) How do you know who you're talking to so you know which authentication data
to use?  For the client, that's pretty easy - the client knows it's calling
server so it can get the keys in advance and not worry.
(It still needs the PGP web-of-trust or X.509 hierarchy to validate the keys.)
But how does the server know who the client is?  IP address?  What if it's
What if it does a DNS lookup, which gets spoofed?  You could use a password-file
equivalent, but that does mean you can only send mail to people who trust you?
3B) How do you do error recovery in PGP, i.e. you either can't find the
other side's
keys, or can find them but can't validate them because you don't have a web
of trust
that gets from you to them.  Do you just fail the call?  (That's secure but
If you complete the call anyway, that means there's a major security risk,
which is that Bad Guys can spoof keys by sending you keys you can't validate.
3C) If you use X.509 hierarchical certification, you _can_ just hand across
the certificate instead of waiting for a PGP keyserver to respond, since the
web of trust is built-in if you're part of the same hierarchy, but there's
still the problem (for the server) of knowing whose certificate to use.

Happens to me all the time - I deposit my money in a dollar-based account,
the dollar takes a dive relative to the Yen, so my account's worth 20% less
in new Japanese cars...   Most of the banks in major European banking
centers and other banking-haven countries will let you have accounts in your
choice of major currencies, and a number of the smaller countries have local currencies
that keep parity with the US dollar or British pound.  That means your account
really has X US dollars in it, not X-US-dollars-converted-to-francs-on-deposit,
or maybe X Bahamian dollars which are officially worth X US dollars but
may be harder to withdraw quickly.
There is still some risk that (for example) the Bahamas government may
decide to default on its foreign debt by suddenly declaring the Bahamas
dollar to no longer match US dollars, but you can only get away with that

interest on foreign deposits because they're ripping off their depositors,
e.g. BCCI or Nugan Hand, but that's more risk in the Caribbean than Europe

get in the US, or where the local tax on bank-interest may be higher than
your US tax rate.)

Not that I know of, but there were some versions with a bug in the random-input
generation - I forget if that was with ~2.2 or ~2.6.0; Colin Plumb had something
to do with it.  I've recently acquired ViaCrypt 2.7.1 for WinDows, and one
nice feature is that in addition to typing in random keystrokes, you can click your mouse in a box and wave it around to input randomness.

Foo.  Clipper is better than anything I could come up with from scratch,

existing pieces like DES and IDEA, but that's a separate issue.)
Even Enigma's pretty strong, and look what it got its users...
Some of Dr. Fred's distrust is well-founded.
DES is also pretty good, and it's looking less and less likely that there's
a secret NSA backdoor in it (other than differential cryptanalysis
and maybe linear cryptanalysis), but it and IDEA and MD5 fundamentally depend on
messiness and obscurity for their security (plus elimination of obvious holes.)
Maybe the authors of IDEA are paid by the same space aliens who really run NSA?
RSA has some provable strength to it, though it's not totally risk-free.  (One Time Pads do too, and yet people manage to misunderstand and
misimplement them almost as much as they mishandle keys.)  If you want a

In a copyrighted article,
Nathan discusses his suggested directions for elder-controlled
filtering of kids' net access.  (Could be parents, or schoolocrats in loco.)
That's probably necessary; it's certainly the efficient way.  A third approach
is Exon's "Censor the whole net, unless perverts can find ways to talk to
each other without any chance of kids hearing them", which is morally
The interesting question is how much overlap develops between this and emerging
reputation/filtering services for adults, for which the filtering criteria are
interestingness-related rather than offensiveness-related.
Yep.  For market reasons, as well as moral, aesthetic, and practical ones.
And any kid who can break that dialog (e.g. by tapping the parent's session
to get the parent's password) won't be stopped by any wimpy restrictions :-)
An important consideration is that filtering has to be application-specific.
Some sites can be cut off entirely (presumably *.penthouse.com),
but most filtering needs to be more granular, and has different time-scales.
You're certainly not going to block access to the whole Library of CONgress
just because there are a few dirty book titles in the on-line card catalog.
For instance, ftp files and static web pages are pretty easy to rate and filter
if you've got a herd of adults to go surfing them.  Dynamic web pages are tougher - do you default to open access,
closed-unless-rated, or just use a no-dirty-words-and-no-pictures blocker?
Usenet - some newsgroups obviously would get blocked, some would get individual articles filtered by humans,
and technical groups would probably with automatic filters to censor certain
posters and certain words, with occasional human monitoring to detect the occasional uses of comp.nerdy.detailed or comp.binaries.eniac for
posting pornography or whatever.  Filtering does slow down conversation,
but enough paid moderators could probably keep up.
But what about chat-programs, IRC, etc.?  You really _can't_ censor
that stuff in real-time and have a meaningful flow of conversation,
except for trivial dirty-word filters which can be exonized around.
Sure, you could have adults watching to say "Hey, cut that out down there!",
and making sure channel names don't have politically incorrect words in them.
And maybe you can have kids-only chat rooms - but what happens when
the kids either start talking like Beavis and [Exon'd]head, or
start talking about (gasp!) sex or (double-gasp!) sexual orientation?
Do you tell their mom? And then there are wide-open technologies like telnet (which can do almost anything) and email (slower, but goes everywhere) - do you
try to restrict those?  One major technology that would be needed for this sort of application
is authentication, whether it's digital-signature-based or just
automatic packet-labelling with applications that maintain labels,
so that you can be sure who posted what within PoliticallyCorrectNet,
know whose mom to call if little FooBar has been misbehaving, whose posting
privileges to block or reading to restrict if their mom grounds them,
or, on the positive side, to encourage people to take responsibility for
their postings and remind them that this kind of service only works
if everybody agrees, up-front, to be Good Citizens.
But how do you manage this technically - require outgoing connections
to all go through proxies?  (You need firewalls anyway.)
But do you require connections from users to go through an authentication
proxy before connecting to internal destinations as well,
or is it adequate to use IPv6 with mandatory authentication and
only add proxy service where it's needed?
And what about encryption?  (And stego?  Do some of those MIDI postings have
NASTY WORDS in them if you play them BACKWARDS?  Oh, no!)
We probably need to understand the politics of this sort of service
to find a way to position encryption as a Good Thing, probably as
part of the authentication system - there's a very high risk that it'd
either be banned, or at least Clipperized with a hierarchical authentication
system.  Of course, if you're banning encryption, or just trying to monitor what's
going on on the net, there's the language problem - English and Spanish
are a start, but it's probably hard for the average ISP to have the right mix of people to tell whether an IRC channel is really
speaking Finnish or Hawai'ian or Tuvan or whether it's just stego.
This is probably a Good Thing - while some services will probably
restrict the languages that people post in (either because they're
Real American monoculturalists or because they're providing a
heavily-monitored service and don't have the bucks for 5000 languages), others will be pushed toward encouraging responsibility instead.

:: Request-Remailing-To: wilcoxb
Cutmarks: -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Bryce - you write:
Convenience, mostly.  Encryption and signature are semi-different issues.
If I clear-sign something, and you don't want to check it, it doesn't cause
you any trouble, but for most people,
getting mail that's encrypted takes extra work, especially
if they're following proper security procedures for their
PGP implementations (not running it on insecure systems, not leaving passphrases in cleartext for autosigners, etc.)
Think of proper security as "solidarity with people who need
real security" :-).  (Yeah, I also run PGP on insecure systems,
mainly for signature-checking, but I do use separate keys that
have words like "insecure" in the userid strings.)
The big issues are convenient interfaces with my email system.
Private Idaho's gotten good enough that if I want to send
encrypted/signed/etc. email, I can grab the mail I want to send
into the clipboard (or compose it inside PI), add headers
for who to send it to, pull down a couple menu items,
and it pops into PGP; when it's done, another menu choice
dumps the completed message back into Eudora, and the next version can send
it out directly if I prefer.  On the other hand,
moving mail _from_ Eudora _to_ PI is still a couple actions
(separate cut/pastes for the body, address, and Subject:),
so I don't usually bother.
The other convenience problem is key-handling for people whose
keys I don't already have.  PGP is too slow on a PC to haul
the entire keyserver database into my pubkey files.  So either I have to send email to a key-server (non-real time,
especially since I do most of my email off-line), or use finger.
Unfortunately, your key wasn't on the keyservers, and I don't
have a decent PC finger client now that I'm using Trumpet Winsock
instead of Netcruiser (the finger client I use doesn't allow
cut&paste to the clipboard, screen-grabs didn't get me text,
and I did eventually get most of your key information by doing
several "telnet you 79"s until one of them got the
data before the session closed :-)  Ugly...
And then there's the key validation problem - your key isn't signed by anyone except yourself (yeah, ok, mine's only got
signatures from previous keys of mine, which have signatures
from expired keys from the people who signed mine :-)
So my signature isn't as meaningful as it could be,
since you probably can't validate it, and I can't guarantee having a valid
public key for you to send you anything important.
So I guess I need to go get my keys signed by a couple people,
and so do you, and the next code project on my wait-until-3.0 list should
probably be a recursive key-signature digger...
Meanwhile, Private Idaho is at ftp.eskimo.com/u/j/joelm/,
and it's now working with ViaCrypt-for-Windows as well as
PGP 2.6.* for DOS.

As with Peter and Nathan, I'm also a former tool of the military-industrial
complex (:-), and Peter's right that the probably source of this assertion
is that there's seldom any "vanilla" TOP SECRET data - anything that's sensitive
enough to get TOP SECRET handling rules is usually part of some compartmented
project (compartmentalization is a formalized version of Need to Know,
where you need to be read into PROJECT X to get PROJECT X data.)
Sensitive Compartmented Information is one well-known class of stuff.
Codeword projects are identified by words picked off a list of
content-free names; some codewords that have been outed in the past are
ULTRA and UMBER.
In addition to project-specific classifications, some of the kinds of labels
on material
include variants on INTEL, CNWDI (Critical Nuclear Weapons Design Information),
RESTRICTED DATA (less critical nuclear weapons data), FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA
( a weird classification for material that isn't RESTRICTED DATA any more but
they still don't want to let folks see.)
And then there's the sort of data that's SECRET by the time the people doing the
grunt-work see it, but it's various extracts of REALLY SPOOKY DATA,
that only a few people back in some agency know the whole picture,
and it's parcelled out so one group of people gets asked to build a
like this, and another gets asked to build a computer system like that,
or a mirror adjuster like that, and none of the grunts know whether the
whole deal is personal teleportation system (the cover project) or a space-based
assassination system,
much less how they decided on the targets....

The tradeoffs are speech encoding quality, and we basically crossed that
line a year or two ago for the high end, and are heading toward mass capability.
9600 baud high-quality speech takes lots of crunching, 13.3 kbps GSM takes
a Sparc 2 or maybe a Pentium, 16 kbps ADPCM is dirt trivial and can probably
run on an 8086.  The coding options with Nautilus run on 386s.
And you can get by with less if you're willing to put up with half-duplex.
Yes, lots of us aren't using modems faster than 14400 now, but you can get a 14.4/19.2 modem at Fry's for well under $100.  (19.2 is unfortunately
not quite enough to 16 kbps, given start and stop bits, unless you do
or start playing with V.42 a bit, but it's close.  Sound cards are down in
the $50 range,
and give you the analog/digital conversion as well as some computation.
Adding a sound card is a bit of work, given the wonderful operating systems
on many PCs :-), but folks put them in along with CDROMs so they can run
all the latest multimedia applications, or high-end versions of DOOM.
Anybody who needs to avoid government or business-competitor eavesdroppers
can probably
afford $150 in extra hardware for their PC.
This doesn't apply to international communications or folks in the boonies,

The RSA code in ViaCrypt 2.4 is different from the PGP code; most of the
rest is the same.  The documentation includes a note from Phil,
and I think the code is signed by him.  You can trust it.  As far as money goes,
I don't know their financial arrangements.  My copy has a pretty low serial
number; I hope they've sold enough to make some bucks.
The Windows version of 2.7.1 is substantially different - it's got a GUI
with a shell-like piece underneath that looks more like vanilla PGP. The Preface says it's using ViaCrypt's DigiSig+ RSA implementation,
the IDEA implementation is licensed from Ascom-Tech AG,
the compression code is from Info-Zip bt Mark Adler and Jean-loup Gailly,
and they've licensed Phil Zimmermann's PGP(tm) for the remainder.
They also acknowledge that lots of people contributed,
including Branko Lankester and Peter Gutmann.
The code is signed by ViaCrypt, and their key is signed by Phil.
The documentation is substantially rewritten, mostly for the GUI part.
The examples are somewhat amusing (removing a signature from a key

Quite easily done.  ftp.ox.ac.uk has a good collection of PGP versions.
(Oh, no!  Somehow these crafty foreigners managed to smuggle munitions out of

PGP 2.6.i was written to be a 2.6-compatible version for non-US use,
or you can use the 2.6.2 source code with RSAEuro instead of RSAREF
and not violate your government's copyright rules.
The reason PGP 2.6 is incompatible with 2.4 and earlier versions is
that it let MIT make PKP happier about letting them use RSAREF,
which gave them patent-legitimacy in the US.  (Incompatibilities
between earlier versions could be blamed on gratuituous attempts
at standards-compatibility...)
[Example deleted.]  Also, the code has been set up so that new versions
can read files written by old versions, and can write files in
old-format when needed; I assume the developers will continue this
approach any time they make incompatible changes.
But the big differences in 3.0 will be libraryizing the code -
one effect is that people will be able to build their own PGP-based tools
more easily than before, but aren't forced to include the whole package,
so people may end up building incompatible parts using the libraries.
Some of this is unavoidable - e.g. an encrypted telnet won't talk to a
batch file encryptor, but they should still be using the same signature code
for session-keys (or DH-halfkeys).

A reasonable approach, but be careful in your implementation.
I haven't seen the book "A Million Wimpy Passwords and their MD5s" yet,
but the CD-ROM version may be out soon :-)  And you can probably
ftp it from dockmaster.
IVs are designed to let you put random stuff in them to discourage
known-plaintext attacks, replay attacks, etc.   However, suppose you
take a known 64 bits from MD5(password) and put them in the IV -
instead of the Bad Guy needing to brute-force 168-bit-deep Triple DES,
he gets to brute force MD5s of human-selected passwords instead,
which makes a lot of pre-computation possible.
Also, for 3-Key Triple-DES, how do you get 168 bits of key from
128bits of MD5?  (for 2-Key 3-DES, you only need 112 bits...)
If you do something like M1=MD5(Key), M2=MD5(M1,Key), realize you've got at most 128 bits of real key instead of 168, though that probably needn't worry you too much...
Won't hurt, as long as you remember to remove it on the decrypt-end.
Put the strong random number in the IV, if you've _got_ a source
of strong random numbers...
You might want to do something fancy like choose a random salt,
use the salt for the IV, and use MD5(salt,human-selected-key) for the key.
This makes pre-computation much less useful (unless you're careless
and use MD5(key,salt) instead if MD5(salt,key)...), and means that
you use a different session key for each batch of stuff you encrypt,
even though you're using the same key.  If you're paranoid about replay
attacks, you could let some of the bits of the salt be random and some be a counter, and never accept a key smaller than the one from the
previous successfully-decrypted message.

Most modems I've seen only have one set of audio interfaces,
and a bump-in-the-cord phone needs two (one for the voice side,
one for the modem line side.)  (Having two jacks doesn't count.)
So you'd need at least two modems, one straight and one re-educated,
and you'd probably need lots more flash ROM than the average modem has.
On the other hand, laptops are increasingly getting multimedia capabilities
like built-in sound cards, and if there's a microphone jack you're in business (uh, well, for $3K or so)   Or a cheaper laptop with two PCMCIA modems,
if you can re-educate one, which also lets you move the non-audio parts
of your secure phone program into the PC.  Of course, if you want long
conversations from the airport, you'll still need to find a payphone
within 4-6 feet of an electric socket and not located under a MegaMuzak speaker,
but that's easier than trying to balance a TI Silent 700 under similar
conditions :-)

It's worth suggesting this _carefully_ so the spin's right.
For instance "Oh, no, Netscape lets Hackers suck all the money

"The US Government's Evil Plans to block encryption are limiting
Netscape's export products to an encryption system already broken

Mr. Shank - I'm a bit disappointed by your posting about the RC4-40 crack.
(You could have used his name, and use of the term "hackers" to the press
tends to be interpreted as a negative...)  Anyway, as to content:
"Two" parallel supercomputers?  You can't really call the Encore Multimax
or the Sequent B8000 a supercomputer - both of them together are slower than
the HP workstation.  The KSR gets closer to supercomputer territory, but
it's only
cracking keys about six times as fast as the faster DEC Alpha (which Damien
only had one of); it increased his horsepower about 20% for two days.
Now, I can see calling a MasPar a "parallel supercomputer"; another effort
at the SSL challenge got the answer about 2 hours before Damien's did,
and used about 4 days of spare time on the MasPar.  Last time I looked,
a MasPar was selling for about $150K, though I don't know how big the one
used on SSL was.  At that price, you could have your own for ~$500/day,
and ripping off $2000 on a credit card isn't tough in today's automated world.
Next year - computer time costs half as much.
Yes, it's still cheaper to get good credit card numbers by scamming carbons
at a mall clothing store or yuppie restaurant, but computer networks let
criminals run their scams wholesale, putting the public at risk both from
organized criminals with their own equipment and any dishonest college
student or office worker who's got a roomful of idle computers to use at night.
Trading off the cost of breaking security vs. the value to be gained is
a good start - lots of people have $2000 of credit limit left on their cards,
and most people have more than $0 left.
Thanks for working on this!

Thanks; it was an interesting panel.  I missed the first half hour,
since traffic was appalling :-), but got to the rest; maybe an hour of
panel discussion and 15 minutes of organized q&a, then wine&cheese.  Just about everybody was concerned about pornography on the net, and thought
that the government had no clue what they were doing and shouldn't be
regulating it;
most thought that the whole issue was really a smokescreen for the government
wanting to regulate the nets and especially interstate commerce ("Hmm, we tried scaring everybody about terrorists on the net, that fizzled,
let's scare them about porn and their kids - that always works!").  About half the panel had kids between 4 and 15.
Lots of concern about media concentration and how this is
currently the only widely accessible medium for 1:N communications
so it's a target.  Some interesting discussions about changes in society
and our relationships with other people that come from net-style communications
and artificiality - Mark Slouka was mainly taking the side of "this is different
and I'm not sure I like it, and the fact that people are desperately seeking
community through this virtual stuff says our communities out in the real world
are probably having some real crises", with interesting thought behind it.
PGN brought in some RISKS stuff, including the how-rumors-spread dynamics;
he also talked a bit about cryptography (he's on that national policy review),
somewhat from the perspective of "it's an international problem and trying
to do things within national borders is ineffective" - I'm not sure he's
on our side here though he's at least clueful.
Dan Gillmor had some good perspectives on objectivity in reporting -
the news business knows it's not objective, and he's at least concerned
with trying to be fair and balanced and as quick as possible about
correcting mistakes, but then he edits the SJMerc business page so it's a
lot clearer what "mistakes" are than in, say, political reporting.
George Baldwin is involved with the IndianNet project, putting things like
Native American artwork on the Web, including for sale.  He brought up some
cultural perspectives - a lot of people have been viewing it, but Native
don't actually _buy_ much of it because they tend to view artwork as personal
and want to know the artist and what it means to him/her, and the net doesn't
do that very well.  If you haven't heard of CSU Monterey Bay, it's opening RSN.
He's on an inter-university study to address things like how to do
on-line registration while preserving privacy (doesn't like export
laws at all.)
Manages E-World and some network things.
Used to wear plastic pocket protectors when he was younger :-)
Consults to big companies that need clues.
One of the liberal arts types on the panel.  Either he or George Baldwin was talking about college students learning creative writing on MUDs and MOOs.

@_subject: Re: Certificates/Anonymity/Policy/True Names 
At 02:47 PM 8/18/95 -0400, Michael Froomkin writes about CAs,
and asks why a CA or customer would want a certificate for
a pseudonym without any identification or True Name.
It's useful for a couple of reasons 1) Continuity - For a single transaction, it doesn't make much difference;
for multiple transactions/communications it does.  If you want to use the nym JohnDoe, and you register with keys.com, you can do repeated transactions (e.g. posting to the net) as JohnDoe/keys.com,
and nobody can impersonate you as long as keys.com doesn't allow duplicates.
This allows people to build reputations under pseudonyms, and do repeat
business or have readers bother to read their postings.
Without certification (whether web-based or hierarchy-based),
you're stuck with always posting your messages with a given key
and hoping people can decide whether they've really got yours or
some other JohnDoe.  Our local Black Unicorn is this way - few of us know his True Name, but his reputation is established.
On the other hand we can't really tell if the many postings by the
L-Name are from a single person, a cooperating group, or imposters
who decided it would be fun to borrow his reputation for the day.
Tim May has occasionally proposed that the key is really all that matters,
and that the name tacked onto it is just an untrustable convenience, but I'd
say that certification does increase that convenience by adding some trust. 2) Policy-vs-Mechanism - Realistically, there'll be software out there
that wants an Official CA-approved certificate to talk to anyone.
If nobody's willing to give certificates to nyms, then nyms can't participate.
3) What's your definition of "prohibit"?  If you mean "Keys.com decides
not to offer the service", they lose the cash they might have made
selling certificates to nyms, lose some customer goodwill, but maybe gain
an improved reputation in other parts of the market, and JohnDoe can
always go to Nyms-R-Us.org and register as JohnDoe32767.
If you mean "the government should ban it", I've done enough anarchist ranting
about how that sort of thing degrades society :-)
However, if you mean "The Certificate Authority Cabal should agree not to
offer any certificates without real ID and contractually forbid lower-level
certifiers to do it either", well, it's a sad thing for society,
but they can do it if they want.  You lose the ability to participate as a nym,
you lose privacy, you lose the value that you might have gained by
transactions with people who wanted to retain their anonymity.
RSA does offer personna certificates to unauthenticated people.
(Also see my follow-on message about my offer to sign PGP keys for nyms.)
4) Are there negatives about dealing with unattributable pseudonyms?  Of course.
But you don't have to deal with them, and there will be CAs who don't,
and services that refuse to deal with unauthenticated pseudonyms,
just as there are on-line services like the Well that allow "unlisted"
identifications but do keep track of true names for their users.
It would be nice if certification authorities did indicate how much trust
they have in the identity of a given key's owner, but markets will take
care of that.

Time to stretch some paradigms :-)
I've decided to offer a service of certifying PGP keys for Pseudonyms.
Normally, it only makes sense to sign PGP keys for people you can
trust to really be who they say they are, but this means you can't
sign keys for people who want to use pseudonyms, which would be a Good Thing.
To try and retain a certain amount of trust in the process,
here's my policy for doing so:
0) I only sign pseudonyms with the psuedonym-signing key below,
which tries to make it clear how trustable it isn't..
1) First Come, First Served - The first user of a given name gets it,
and the only guarantee I'll make about verification is that I won't
sign more than one key with the same name unless the later key is signed
by the earlier key.
2) At least for now, keys need to  indicate pseudonymity in the name.
3) If you're using a name I recognize, I might check it out with the
person I know who uses that name.  3A) If you're claiming to be L.Detweiler, I'll want a fax of your ID :-)
1) Requests by email; I will mail a copy of the key to the keyserver
and to the address you sent the request from if I can.
2) Price is 1 Digicash e$, or 1 Tacky Token, or a big prime number,
or an interesting cypherpunk-related URL (well-known sites only count
if it's something new.  New code is always interesting!)
3) I'll post interesting payments to  ,
and if it's something that takes a while to verify (e.g. I haven't
gotten my free stuff from digicash.com yet :-) and your payment bounces,
I'll probably post that too :-)

For the usual NP-hard problems, including keycracking, checking the answer
once you have it is easy - the hard part is finding the answer.
Another way to look at it is that most of the work is throwing away the
2**N-1 keys that aren't correct, and if you've got one correct key you don't
need to know about the rest (except in special cases where there are multiple
keys that work, but usually you don't care about that.)
Most people are honest, except Bad Guys.  The honesty problem is more serious for negative results - if somebody says
"Range N1-N2 doesn't have the key", they could be honest, or they could
be a Bad Guy who knows that the key really _is_ in that range and wants
to prevent you from searching it, or they could be a scammer who wants to
get paid for searching but didn't actually do the work.  If people are
willing to be paid in lottery-mode (only the person who finds they key gets
then honesty's not a problem.  Otherwise, only hire honest people (plus Bad
and if they don't find the key after the first sweep, try again (switching off
ranges so one Bad Guy doesn't get to lie about the same range twice.)
Alternatively, you could do a model where everybody gets paid, but only after
the answer is found, which discourages scammers (since they don't get paid if
they lie about searching the range that has the real key.)  If a Bad Guy lies
about the key not being in his range, people do have an incentive to look for it
if the first pass fails, and have an incentive to finger him if they do find the key on a later pass.

@_subject: Re: Exportable if Escrowed 
PGP inherently provides master-key service, which can be used for escrow.
On a normal PGP message, there's a session key which the sender knows,
and a copy of the session key is provided to the recipient, who can open
it on the condition that he has the genuine private key.  That's fairly
close to _real_ escrow - it's certainly closer than Clipper's Master-Key stuff.
(And it has a lot more masters :-)
If PGP message-senders want to do so, they can use multiple recipients
on a given message, so the key is accessible to a third party trusted by
the sender (the legitimate recipient already can give it to trusted parties.)
(Typically a sender might use encrypt-to-self to retain the key for later use.)
An amusing feature to add to PGP (using the 3.0 toolkits when available)
would be a session-key-splitting feature, which uses Shamir M/N sharing or
a simple two-way split and encrypts the splits with different people's
public keys,
so that you could give them to semi-trusted parties.
Of course, the Clintonites' proposal of "Well let you use slightly less wimpy
encryption in return for GAK" is really offensive - if they've got GAK,
it doesn't matter if they keys are 64000 bits long, since they'll have them.
On the other hand, master GAK keys don't fit well into a Web of Trust -
you'd essentially have to require that people only send mail to keys that are
signed by an escrow service, and people wouldn't always do that if they had
a choice - to enforce GAK, you either need to limit the sender's encryption
software (unrealistic) or the recipient's decryption software (unrealistic),
probably by requiring exportable products to use a specific hierarchical

Reason number 0 why you'd want someone's True Nym -

COINTELPRO may have been unreal and UnAmerican, but it happened.
Now, trusting people based on mutually trusted introducers may have

as destructive as if they actually _were_ a cop.  But it's what there was.
(Ok, you had some extra sources of information, like whether the person
actually paid all their organization dues (COP!) or smoked dope with you
(and inhaled) or started advocating unreasonable violence (probable cop)...)
That doesn't mean you checked government-issue ID from people or necessarily
even used True Names; you could be dealing with people in person who
you only knew as "Bill from Delaware" or "Bear" or "Jeanie from the Sierra

run-length encoding before doing the MD5, e.g. crunch the output down to a series of count1 value1 count2 value2 count3 value3 (if you stick to runs of

@_subject: Re: SSL trouble 
Several people have suggested random keyspace selection instead of servers.
The problem is that there's a high probability that the search will fail to
find the correct key.  If you split the keyspace into n segments, and randomly
select k of them, the probability of failure p = ((n-1)/n)**k ; for k=n, p approaches 1/e (.367) as n becomes large, and 10 is close enough to large
that you don't gain much by having independent groups that agree not to overlap
in their own 10% of the keyspace.  For k=2n (random-searching the space
about twice),
the probability of failure is still e**-2, about 13%.  You need a
coordinated search.
That more or less works, assuming you can distribute the list of slaves
along with the code; you still hit the slaves' DNS servers unless you
also distribute IP addresses for the slaves to use (which is probably fine
as long as people get the addresses beforehand.)
You could get fancy and have a DNS server hand out slave addresses round-robin
for a dummy address slave.cracker.org.
The main failure mode seems to have been misconfigured clients grabbing the
single-threaded server for a long time; it may be worth using a multi-threaded
server, or alternatively a single-threaded server that has a fast timeout for how long it will talk to a client.
I gather there was some protection in the code against dishonest clients,
but a malicious attack would be to falsely ACK large portions of
the search space (especially the portion containing the real answer,
if the attacker knows it).  #                                Thanks;  Bill

Doling out keyspace _does_ require central coordination, though
the job can be delegated to _trusted_ volunteers, or delegated
with redundancy to semi-trusted ones.
As far as safe viruses go, I've had more free lunches than safe viruses,
though I've been offered both out of "charity".  Some of the lunches
were good, and charitable; the viruses have been, at best, mostly harmless.
Perhaps under Safe-Tele-Java-Script it will be possible to send
self-modifying self-reproducing scripts around a network to unsuspecting
machines, but I doubt it.
Yeah.  In this case, the lifetime of the versions was less than the
expected lifetime of some of the searches.  Automated version-checking would
help, but the version changes made it difficult to communicate even simple
requests like "Give me a number".  Perhaps it would make sense for version
upgrading to include changing the server's TCP port so the old versions
don't hose the servers for the new versions.
Randomness doesn't help much, since it's hard to be sure you
sweep the whole keyspace.  Redundancy does help, but it's still tough
to protect against sufficiently malicious attackers.
You could do that.  But simply asking for more numbers after you've
finished the previous batch accomplishes much the same thing;
special tuning may be more useful for folks with MasPars than 486s,
where redundantly giving out unacked search space can do more.

80 is an interesting number.  Clipper-sized :-)  It's much less than 128,
which seems to be popular for other software and works well with MD5-based
random session key generators.  It's also interestingly bigger than 64,
which the Feds are trying to tell us is good enough for non-government work.
Are RSA giving in to the Feds?  Or are they trying to up the bid, at least allowing us something as good as Clipper if we can't get 128?  Not my poker
Let's look at some threat models.
It's probably more than strong enough for any data you're willing to keep
on a machine running MS-DOS, where serious attackers will go around it;
it's about right for random "left your laptop in the airport" security,
and for business use, if the police are going to confiscate your machine,
they can probably subpoena the keys from somebody in your company anyway.
Random hackers aren't going to be able to crack it, unlike 40-48 or maybe 56.
It's big enough that the NSA probably can't break it right now,
but in 10-20 years of computer speed growth they'll be able to if they want.
It's probably fine for dealing with amounts less than $1-100M for maybe 10
and for misdemeanors and light felonies if you're not using the key escrow :-)
And in 5 years, you'll be using a different operating system (even if it _is_
named "Windows"), so you'll need a new version, and you can re-encrypt your data
when you move it to a decent-sized disk instead of that wimpy 9GB mechanical
Anybody who's got a 5-year-old dump of your system has probably stolen any
secrets you care about long since anyway.

PGP identifies the key for decryption and signature checking from the message.
When you're signing a message or key, you can pick which of your keys to
use with the -u option.  The difficulty is getting people to use your
encryption key instead of your signature key when encrypting stuff for you.
Derek mentioned one approach (get people to load the encryption key first);
unfortunately, you can't predict their behavior, and if you change encryption
keys more often than signature keys, they'll load the newest encryption key
Another approach is to identify them in the names - my key certification key
says "KeyCert-only" in the text.
For the problem that started this discussion, though, there's no good solution.
Since the Bad Guys _can_ encrypt a message to you with your signature key,
and send it to you by anonymous remailer, they can plant a reason to suspect
that you may have evidence encrypted with that key.

@_subject: Re: Some details on RSA Secure 
It's an interesting approach - simpler than installing as a file system
(I'm not using SecDrv because it needs a separate partition),
but so far it seems relatively useable.  On the other hand,
since there are file types it refuses to encrypt, like DLLs,
there are some things it can't protect (like DLLs with passwords
embedded in them.)
I've got mixed feelings about this - since my password has normally
timed out by the time I shut down, it demands a password before
shutting down, and if I had any large amount of data there,
I assume it would take a while to reencrypt on my 386-box.
(Laptops are generally slower than similar-age desktops,
and you often want to shut them down quickly, even when
they aren't shutting themselves down to save power.)
I haven't tried powering it off during this process, but I assume
that at best the files would be unencrypted and at worst there'd
be one half-decrypted and sitting in limbo to be trashed the
next time the system starts up?
Since the documentation mentions 512-bit and 1024-bit RSA keys,
I'd guess that each file has a separate random RC4 key which is
stored in the file header, encrypted with the user and escrow
RSA keys plus the MD5 hash, plus the encrypted real filename?
(The alternative would be that the userpref.!!! file contains an
RC4 key encrypted with RSA, which is used to encrypt the file keys,
but that would lead to much shorter headers, and cracking that master
RC4 key would then allow cracking of all documents on the system,
so I'm guessing that's not the approach used.)
1) The "Emergency" menu item in the File Manager is annoying.
Could it be combined with the RSA menu item, eliminated, or
at least have the option of abbreviating the name?
2) Can keys and files be shared between multiple machines,
i.e. the same user keys on a desktop and laptop, so that
individual encrypted files can easily be moved back and forth?

@_subject: Re: Acceptable NIS&T restrictions 
At 12:54 PM 9/4/95 -0400, Pat Farrell commented on the NIST's
latest proposals for their September meeting on export controls
and software with built-in government access to keys (GAK).
I'll generally use the terms GAK or master keying rather than escrow,
since escrow is a legal term that implies both the willingness of
both parties to use it, and also that the escrowed material
be delivered only when certain criteria are satisfied, which is out of the scope of almost any proposals I've seen labelling themselves
"key escrow", particularly the Clipper system.
Material with > and indentation are from the NIST paper;
material with just > and 0-1 spaces is Pat's.
64 bits of keyspace is of course hopelessly inadequate for financial
transactions - crackerboxes have been designed that allow very rapid breaking
of single-DES or short-key RC4, and a useful platform needs to accommodate
high-value transactions such as customers access to stockbrokers as well as
more limited-value transactions such as credit cards where a $1000 cracking
cost makes crime not pay well.  The Administration argues that the limitation
makes up for the possibility that users may find ways to evade GAK; but users
can already do that now.
(CME is Carl Ellison at TIS; tran is a simple transposition system.)
Sure - if the software always tacks in master keys any time it
does a symmetric-key encryption, and won't/can't decrypt without it,
then DES+GAK | DES+GAK | DES+GAK is just as vulnerable to someone
with the master key as single DES+GAK - it just takes three separate
phases of key forfeiture to decode.  (yes, I left out the tran phase;
anybody going to that much work is using something other than the
built-in encryption, at which point they might as well use
non-government-approved encryption themselves.)  Does it triple the
key space?  For people without the master key, yes, though maybe they
get some known plaintext.  For people with the master key, it depends
on your definitions, and maybe _they_ put in some known plaintext that
they don't give outsiders, but it probably doesn't lose them much.
Probably.  Consider the sort of master-key system where part of the
session key isn't transmitted - maybe you do something like
hash the user portion of the session key with the hash of the
program and feed it to the KeyMaster's public key to get
the session key.  By the time you put all of that into
Pretty Good PatchAround, you might as well just use PGP.
Information can't be destroyed, only forgotten, so time-limitation is tough.
What you can do is limit the scope of messages that can be decrypted by
one trip to the keymaster - the Feds are looking for some mechanism so that
any limits like this won't require multiple trips for one bunch of wiretapping.
What's reasonable?  Some potential models for a PGPng would be - Use separate keys for signatures/keysigning and messages, so you could
change your message key frequently while leaving your signature (or at least
key-signature) key stable.  (This tends to need an extra layer in the web
of trust, since you now have two tiers for yourself, but no biggie.)
- Diffie-Hellman kind of mechanism to encrypt the keys, with published
g, p, g**x mod p, x changing frequently, RSA or DSS or whatever to sign
the keyparts - this works better with a more interactive key negotiation
so you can use a new x every time (e.g. request directly from the user,
though that's difficult for email, or a keyserver that maintains a set of
keys to be doled out.)
The technical and political questions are quite different.  Technically, you could have the software require a hierarchical-style
certificate for the key-master keys with a US Government CA wired in.
It's not totally foolproof - patching the CA is easy unless you've got
some sort of checksum on the software.  But it's a start, and it's simple
enough that either the US could authorize separate versions for France
or certify the French government's key-master agency.
Also, there's a need for escrow/keymaster agents to be negotiable per-message -
since escrow inherently requires the trust of all parties, and probably
contractual agreements as well, and government-enforced keymastering
may require satisfying multiple governments, parties will persumably
have different lists of acceptable keymasters.
As far as the political criteria go, I believe the traditional formulation
is along the lines of "I am not now, nor have I ever been, a member of...." :-)
Establishing criteria is difficult, and depends on whether the whole system
will be defined by laws passed by Congress or only by organizational policy;
there are also issues of control between the Commerce Department, NIST, NSA,
and the State Department.  For Commercial Key Escrow, or commercial key-backup services, the criteria are "whoever can be trusted to provide the services the customers want".
In this case, of course, the service most customers want is to be left alone,
or, failing that, to have the government's Master Key system provide minimal
to the security of the actual transactions - 64 bit keys are not enough security
for any high-valued financial transactions, though they may suffice for
credit cards.
One required characteristic would appear to be either sufficiently deep pockets
to collect judgements for violations of trust or a sufficiently high
reputation that
violations of trust are not expected.  Most of the commercial market for key escrow or backup services fits into three
categories - backups for the owner/sender of a file (which they can provide
themselves, using techniques like PGP's Encrypt-to-Self option, or file backups
with secret-sharing), acknowledgements of transmission (signed hashes would do),
and dispute-resolution issues (verifying the contents of a message which may
information from both parties or ephermeral session key information.)
Most can be provided by the kind of services currently provided by companies
bonding agencies, emergency backup and offsite storage companies, etc.

At 01:01 PM 9/2/95 CDT, droelke (Daniel R. Oelke)
Pure public-key is usually not very useful, since it's rather slow
for encrypting big messages by itself.  PKP has the patents to all public-
key systems until mid-1997, and for RSA until some time like 2001,
and Schnorr for longer.  Unfortunately, RSAREF (except for one version
where they slipped) requires non-commercial users to limit themselves
to the published interface or get explicit permission, and the published
interface always throws in DES with a random key for encryption.
Since you're talking embedded systems, you're probably commercial and
high enough volume that the cost for licensing RSA is probably low enough.
45-55 bits may be tough, depending on the constraints of your
environment - most public-key systems need 768-1024 bits of
key to be reasonably secure, and need to send an output field
at least that long to be decodeable.  If that's not a problem,
you've got some choices.  For instance, you could use Diffie-Hellman
to create a shared secret, and just XOR that with your material
(have the workstation generate a master x, g, and p, and
store g**x in your embedded system; choose a random y each time, and
send g**y mod p and the first |M| bits of (g**xy mod p) xor M.
To do that, you need to store g**x, g, and p, possibly in ROM,
and enough code to do modular exponentiation and random number generation;
hopefully your system will have some kind of quasi-physical source of

At 10:31 AM 9/5/95 -0800, Doug Barnes wrote to Hal and us:
There's a way to get this without sending as much data -
using a relative of S/Key (probably not affected by S/Key patent.)
A sends B two random numbers, thing1 and thing2.
B's headers include a prefix of
        n, hash( thing2, hash^n(thing1) )
where hash^n is n rounds of hash, e.g. MD4 or MD5.
Thing2 can possibly be a well-known string instead.  Assuming there's no special relationship between thing2 and the hash function, it should be hard to derive         hash( thing2, hash^n(thing1) ) from         hash( thing2, hash^(n-1)(thing1) )
presumably as hard as inverting the hash.  (Brute-force is an option if thing1 is not chosen well, involving a few hundred hashes on a few million popular wimpy passwords,
but S/Key suffers from the same weakness.)
Including n in the header is a mild message-correlation risk, though messages don't have to be sent with consecutive n's (at a cost of more runs of hash per message.)  This lets you recover
easily from lost messages.  There's also the mild risk that the
thing1 and thing2 keys need to be stored, though Doug's method
also suffers from that.
It is also possible to use S/Key itself - the original message
from B to A contains Xn = hash^n(key) and maybe n.  The next message contains Xn-1 = hash^(n-1)(key), which A checks by hashing it and looking in his table of messageids for Xn.
A can recover from small numbers of lost messages by hashing a few times.
(Since you're not using it for authentication, is it covered by
the S/Key patent?)
This method has the weakness that Traffic Analysts can also
correlate messages by hashing the fields and comparing with previous.
One workaround is to for B to also send A the keys for some simple
encryption method E such as "Ek = m xor k" and use Xn = Ek(hash^n(key)).
This requires A to perform an xor and a hash for each correspondent
(B, C, D, ...), but is probably secure enough.  Alternatively,
since the numbers are fairly short, you can use "Ek = m^k mod p",
but that's starting to look like work :-).

You're probably right.  On the other hand, especially as dealers in
politically incorrect substances get better privacy technology,
this will become much more of an issue, and I get the impression from
what I read in the papers that big drug busts, arrests of major
organized crime figures, and the rare terrorist cases are probably
big career wins for the police agents and prosecutors involved.
As you might guess, I think the government makes lots of laws about
things that are not their business, and wiretaps and other privacy
invasions are especially useful for prosecuting victimless crimes and dissident political groups, since none of the participants call the cops.
On the other hand, I've had friends whose businesses have been burned down by the Mafia, and don't like murderers bombing pubs, either,
and stopping people like that is legitimate police business.
However, I think the moral case is very clear that people have the
right to communicate freely and privately, and to use whatever
technology or languages they want to to attempt to do so;
any government that would try to prevent that is more of a threat
to freedom than a benefit.  And police have had a lot of success with
informants, and new technology has really improved equipment for
bugging suspects- if you folks do your jobs honestly and apologize
when you make mistakes about invading incorrect suspects' privacy,
go ahead and use it.
The really gray areas are things like widespread coordinated
surveillance of public activities - cameras in the subways, etc.

The basic problem is that stealth wasn't an original design criterion,
so many parts of the PGP data format reveal at least that PGP is
being used, and occasionally other information as well.  Some things
are easy to work around (----- BEGIN PGP etc.), and some aren't.
Changing this takes a substantial amount of redesign.

Similarly, if someone emails you a bunch of random numbers....
Most of the time, for most users now, it's not an issue.  But there are people who will need to hide encrypted messages, and as anti-privacy laws in the US become stronger, that may be us.
Is this an issue for PGP 3.0.1, or an issue for Privacy:TNG?
Probably the latter, given the state of the PGP world,
and certainly ranting at the developers to do it now is uncool.
But it should be a design goal.

@_subject: Re: Why ecash is traceable 
I first reacted to Hal's posting about the way Tim did.
I got confused by the "Charlie" issue, but I think I see it.
It's probably still possible to do _some_ tracing in an online system.
As in the previous example, Alice is going to conspire with the
bank to catch Bob, _before_ she pays Bob the money; afterwards is too late.  Alice creates an account Alice2 and spends the cash.
Then she pays Bob the same cash.  When Bob tries to deposit it,
the bank notices it's already been spent, and does one of
1) rejects the payment using the normal double-spending prevention
   (not very useful for kidnapping/ransom cases, since Bob
    may kill the victim or whatever)
2) detects the double-spending but uses special-case software to
   tell Bob they're accepting the payment, and trace his account
   or trace the place he's depositing it from, or not actually credit
   it the money they're sending him a receipt for, or whatever.
If Bob wants to prevent the bank from tracing his deposit back to him,
he'll need an anonymous on-line connection; this would probably need
to be some sort of packet laundry, which is easy enough to implement,
or at least a fancy firewall.  If Bob is a real Bad Guy (as opposed
to Alice being the Bad Guy), Bob will probably set up some kind
of temporary account at the bank to deposit the money in,
followed rapidly by withdrawing the money and abandoning/closing
the account.  If Bob is a kidnapper, he probably kills the kid;
if he's just an undocumented retailer, he may not ship the pharmaceuticals,
or may start announcing that Alice is a probable narc.
There are difficulties, with online clearing, though - with physi-cash,
Bob can look at it and say "it looks good/bad" without actually
possessing it; with online clearing, he can lie about "it was pre-spent",
and there's no way to let him check the cash except by either giving it
to him or using messy all-or-nothing-disclosure-of-secrets techniques
(e.g. Alice and Bob flip a coin to decide whether Bob gets to spend
a pre-committed digibuck or Alice gets to demonstrate that it's ok
and spend it first) though an online system could reduce this problem
substantially by recording the time that a given digicash was spent
and reporting that time in double-spending rejections (a first-spending
at approximately the same that Alice gives Bob the money and he deposits it
is obviously suspicious; it doesn't actually identify which one
of them cheated, though they'll both know (unless it was the bank cheating). A first-spending time substantially before that implicates Alice.)
Unfortunately, it's probably a lot harder to design a blinding system
that lets the payee blind the cash without allowing him to create
forged bills (at least forged bills based on a hard-to-identify
original bill.)
maybe so...

It does give you some verifiability (somebody else can take the session key

If that's what you plan to use it for, you would also need to have the

Sigh.  Folks have gotten too used to PC-market email systems,
which are generally braindamaged by having been around operating
systems where you can't just run a listner program that waits
for somebody to call you when they want to send you mail,
which of course fits in very well with letting ISPs avoid
having to make outgoing phone calls instead of just receiving,
plus the market reluctance of many of them to forward mail for you
to competing mail services and the client/server-orientation
that makes peer-to-peer services harder to implement.
Unix systems did this job just fine on PDP11/70s, which could
support a dozen or two users on a machine with about the
horsepower of a PC/AT.  And Henry Spencer could do that on a /44 :-)
Just about anything that does UUCP can be set to do that,
if you've got an ISP who doesn't charge you lots extra for
using UUCP.  Most high-end terminal emulation packages
have scripting languages that let you call up and do stuff,
which you should be able to call from timer programs;
you can probably even find a free Kermit version that will
do it.
I use Eudora Light with Trumpet to call Netcom's newbie-friendly
Netcruiser service; when I hit the menu item for send or retrieve
mail, it pops through all the layers and dials, and hangs up when it's done.
If Commercial Eudora can't already do that automagically, it should - ask Qualcomm to add it to the next version...  Alternatively, Winsock
programming isn't really all that hard, and POP3 is a pretty simple
protocol, so you could roll your own.

2) Naive friendliness - the Sirius Cybernetics approach.  "Your mail file has

@_subject: Re: NYT on Netscape Crack 
That's a good, and realistic, attitude.
I do hope this is just John Markoff's simplification of what Netscape's folks said and not an endorsement of security-by-obscurity.
I realize that some data does need to be kept around on disk
or in the program, since obtaining a lot of random bits at the beginning
of every transaction either requires annoying user interactions or
takes too long to get decent quality, and certainly this data
ought to be kept private by the algorithms involved.
One concern I've had about the popular "crunch some bits repeatedly
through MD5" approach to random number generation is that knowing
one sample from the stream (e.g. by doing a transaction with the victim)
gives you the rest of the stream.  There's a way to improve that.
        let X(0) be some number you keep around from a previous
                session, modified by whatever hardware randomness
                is available, and seeded by user input the first time.
        let X(i) = MD5(X(i-1))           let Y(i) = hash(X(i)), where hash is something like MD5(key,X(i))
        use Y(i) as the output random number.
This eliminates the ability to determine X(i) or Y(i+1) as a function of Y(i),
since the search space of X(i) is presumably too large to reverse (unlike
the number of bits you can cheaply get in one session).  Keeping some of the
bits of Y(i) around to use in addition to the other key for the hash, or to
key the MD5(X(i-1)) with, may be useful as well.

Be _very_ careful with this approach - it's the kind of thing that a
rogue server or client might abuse to find out randomness or other state
information about the clients or servers connecting to it.
At minimum, only give out some of your randomness, XORed with some
arbitrary value to scramble the range and then hashed before sending,
so that the recipient can't find out the values you're using.
One valuable technique is to continually accumulate any randomness available,
rather than just going for what's available right when you need it.
However, one source of right-when-you-need-it randomness to contribute
to session keys is hashing the plaintext, or at least the first chunk of it;
if you use this carefully (e.g. by throwing it in with the rest of your
hash input), it should provide input unavailable to the attacker.
Also, while network boards and sound cards can provide useful randomness,
you can't depend on their existence, at least in the PC world; most home users
probably connect over modems and don't have LANs.  So any software that
would like to use these needs to include methods of detecting their existence
before trying to get data from them.  (Suns obviously all have network

A nice addition to any Netscape RNG hacks is the comment that,

the NSA may have a BUG in theirs, and only they'll know for sure...
John Gilmore's comments on CAPSTONE, subliminal channels, and FOIA blackouts certainly add depth to this suspiciousness.  I'd initially not been too worried
about the Fortezza (besides the obvious Master Key problems) because the NSA
is letting the military use them for Defense Messaging Service.  However,
if the RNG might be different for different vendors, the non-military versions
may be using a weak RNG, which the NSA has a backdoor to.  Alternatively,
the RNGs may all be the same, but there may be an option that the military can
use to get full-strength random numbers while the public, not knowing this,
gets weakened ones (e.g. the first n bits of the RNG may be random, and the next
N-n bits may be a strong hash, while there are N-n real random bits in another
register if you ask for them nicely.)
On a technical note, I would have thought that Fortezza and/or CAPSTONE used
some sort of hardware RNG, i.e. noisy Zener diodes or whatever.  I've seen it
mentioned on this list that some other NSA secure phones, such as STU-III,

the NSA's taking a different view of trustability of software encryption for authentication purposes than they used to.
A C2 rating says that most of the obvious bugs have been found, access to
the system and individual files requires authentication, and you can do an audit trail to find out who accessed what data when.  Ignoring networks,
that's not too bad.  But, yeah, one of the big reasons for C2 rating is that
government RFPs generally require C2 security, at least for military or
sensitive non-military purchases.  B-level ratings give you multi-level
security, so you can run SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL on the same box;
it's not a very useful security model for non-military applications,
but does let you do a better-trusted job of system integrity.
Hah.  Maybe it's changed since I was working with the AT&T System V/MLS folks,
but the vast majority of classified processing back then was done on unrated
or C2 systems running System High - everybody's cleared, and the boxes
with the classified stuff aren't connected to the outside except by
limited sneakernet.  You can get a _lot_ of security by keeping your
computers in locked rooms, and the average PC of those days could fit
in a big safe at night even if it couldn't fit in a locked file cabinet.
(And floppy disks or external shoeboxes were easy to lock up.)

That's the kind of thing that would get changed for a C2 version,
just as the Unix login program had to be souped up for C2 and B1.
Even adding a constant delay, or an increasing delay after bad attempts,
is a good start for systems like that.  (It turns out that logging
user names on bad attempts has to be done carefully to avoid
increasing risk - if users get out of sync on typeahead when
entering their login and password, you can end up logging passwords, which was especially bad when that sort of data got
printed on the paper console...)

@_subject: Hack Microsoft At Work Fax? 
I've been helping a client install Microsoft Windows for Workgroups,
which comes with Microsoft At Work Fax.  The fax software, in addition
to doing normal stuff, lets you encrypt faxes with passwords or public-key
encryption for sending to other people who use the same software.
The manual has minimal technical information, so I don't know the algorithms
it uses; it mostly talks about what GUI buttons to push.  I was hoping the section on taking your software overseas would say
something about
Export Laws and International Arms Traffickin' (and creatin' a disturbance...)
but all it said was how to set the international-direct-dialing phone codes
so you can get your fax to go where you want.  Because of that, I'm guessing it's something like RC4/40 and RSA-512 with some sort of user name as part of the public key field, but I'd like to know more, and I'm also guessing that they've got some sort of general export license permission from the Feds.
The public-key system uses a public key file with "154 computer-generated characters", and recommends exchanging public keys by floppy disk.  I don't know if that's 154*8 bits, or 154*6 or *4, or if there's a user-name
string using up some of those characters; probably the latter since it's
probably 512 bits because of export.
I called the usually helpful Microsoft Technical Support phone number,
and they were friendly and will try to get back to me, but this is
way out of the scope of the kind of questions they're used to :-)
And the stuff I could find from the Web page or ftp.microsoft.com
on encryption had less than the manual, plus some stuff on password
encryption, plus some stuff on their RAS remote network access stuff
which apparently uses DES as well as standard PPP handshaking or
Shiva handshaking.
Does anybody have any more information?  It'd be fun to hit up Microsoft
for the next crack if it's weak enough; the fax stuff can also be sent by MSMail
so there is eavesdropping potential.

@_subject: X.509, S/MIME, and evolution of PGP 
I'd always heard X.509 public key certificates were a hierarchical, evil,
anti-WebOfTrust ISOism.  But Netscape is now doing them, and talking S/MIME,
so I sat down to read the specs, and they're really not all that bad.  (Technically, I've only read PKCS and RFC 1422, and not the real ISOisms...)
Yeah, they've got lots of clunky ASN.1 Ambiguous Encoding Rules and X.500 Silly Name Format, but those can be lived with, and the X.500 may be possible
to simply ignore in most cases.  Steve Kent, author of RFC1422, envisions that
a hierarchical world with government certification authorities would be the
most convenient implementation, and with the X.500 directory service serving
certificates, but that's primarily editorial and not required by the technology.
Since a zillion and a half people are about to acquire Netscape 2.0,
which supports non-Verisign-signed X.509 certificates and DES, we can definitely extend the Web of Trust concept to that world; can we also extend secure user-to-user messaging?  It's time for PGP to mutate and
take over the world...
An X.509 certificate has the following components         1.  version
       2.  serial number
       3.  signature (algorithm ID and parameters)
       4.  issuer name
       5.  validity period
       6.  subject name
       7.  subject public key (and associated algorithm ID)
expressed as ASN.1 and signed with the issuer's public key.  The issuer and
subject names are expressed as X.500 addresses (big deal).  The CA's public key
is expected to be obtained out of band, or as a chain of signatures from
some other CA that you got a signature for out of band; there's no policy
implementation that says who can be one.  The primary requirements on CAs are
to never issue the same serial number twice, maintain uniqueness on signatures for subjects, and maintain a Certificate Revocation List which
is accessible somehow.  Unfortunately, the data format doesn't support
multiple signatures, but the documentation _does_ explicitly indicate that
you can _have_ multiple certifications; you just have to drag around
a bunch of separate certificates, leading to some obvious implementation
opportunities.  CRLs are less well-specified, though the PEM RFCs suggest
a PEM format; the main requirement is that they be keyed off the serial number,
which is why that has to be unique.
RFC 1422 proposes a rooted hierarchy of CAs - a root called the Internet Policy
Registration Authority, which would certify a bunch of Policy Certification
which would each have different requirements on what their CAs require from
people who want to be certified, ranging from anonymous personas to heavily
identified Official People, and would do a certain amount of coordination to
preserve uniqueness.  Becoming a PCA would require paying money to the IPRA.
However, there's no requirement that a _specific_ organization become the
_one_ _official_ IPRA; if somebody were to volunteer and announce themselves
as the IPRA, there's no particular conflict-resolution mechanism.
[ maybe it's time for a Cypherpunks Press Release?  No - I didn't say it.
Not me! ]
But rootedness only really matters to software that cares... and as long
as your software accommodates N levels of certification, you can
have a Web of Trust getting back to a key you signed yourself, and either
get an official personna certificate or plug your public key into your
software as the IPRA (and sign the real IPRA's certificate yourself :-)
1) ITAR - shouldn't be a big deal, because all of this is building a
signature/authentication mechanism, it's not doing any encryption.
The encryption, if any, is a user agent issue, and that's Netscape's problem;
the Web of Trust tool is an add-on.
2) RSA patent - can this be built with RSAREF?  Or RSAREF with permission
for a couple extra activities?  Or built out of RIPEM or RIPEM-SIG?
The latter has the benefit of already being exportable.
3) Netscape compliance - the Netscape folks have been real friendly,
and I hope they'll leave their format for getting certificates open.
4) Other software and CA policy-makers - getting out first is worth something;
then you're the standard that they have to follow instead of the other way
For some issues, like X.500 name vs. DNS name, there are probably people in the IETF or community in general working on it, or alternatively you can do an ugly hack abusing the organization and address fields.
5) S/MIME - real S/MIME compliance requires support for RC2 as well as
publicly available algorithms, though this is really just an X.509 handler.
6) It's a lot of work - well, yeah, it is.  And I'm lazy.  Is there enough
related code in SSLeay to steal to help implement it?

@_subject: Re: Looking for advice. 
[Perry Metzger often has good comments about the order of doing things in.]
Are you planning to encrypt your sessions, or not?  What threats are you worried about?  What threats are you aware of but not worried about?
How much opportunity do the users of the programs have to set up communications
beforehand?  Is this one-shot, or will a given client and server do a lot
of repeat business?  Are you concerned about privacy from machine to machine,
or also from user to user?  Are you worried about man-in-the-middle attacks?
Are you worried about protecting the user's name, or only their password?
Are you willing to buy hardware, or do you want software-only?
How critical is setup speed?  How slow are your processors?
Are you worried about your TCP sessions getting hijacked once you've
done the authentication?
For some applications, Diffie-Hellman is a good answer - the basic protocol
doesn't do authentication, but does do secure key negotiation as long as you
either don't have a man-in-the-middle or else have authentication such as
digital signatures on your key-parts.  Once you've created a shared key
by DH, you can then use it to encrypt your session, or at least exchange passwords securely.
If you're willing to buy a bit of hardware, there are cryptographic smartcards
that let you generate time-varying one-time passwords; some of them are decent.
Phil Karn's S/Key technology (ftp-able from and I think patented by Bellcore)
takes a nice approach using hash functions - let h^n(m) denote message m cranked
through hash function h n times, = h(h(h(...(h(m))...))), where h is a secure
one-way hash like MD4 that's tolerably fast.  To set up, calculate h^n(m),
and store it in the server's password file.  When you log in for the first time,
the server tells you n-1, you calculate h^(n-1)(m), send it as your password,
the server hashes it to get h^n(m), and compares it with the saved value.
If it works, the server now saves h^(n-1)(m); the next time it'll ask you for
n-2, you give it h^(n-2)(m), the server hashes to get h^(n-1)(m), etc.
Obviously you've got to reset after n-1 uses.
If you have an environment where you can store secret keys safely on the server,
you can use secret-key challenge-response methods effectively - the server
sends a random number, and you send back the number, encrypted, or there are
variants where you modify the number by 1, with or without timestamps,
and maybe the server sends the number encrypted also.  If you can't secure
a general-use machine, but are able to secure a machine that just does
authentication and keep it locked in a room with only network access and power,
pretty soon you've invented Kerberos.
Do you need separate public keys for each application X user?  Depending on what
you're trying to authenticate, you could have a public key for the application
or even just the machine it runs on, and send passwords encrypted with that;
again there are variants with timestamps, random challenges, etc., to deal
with issues like replay attacks.  Or maybe you can have the server issue
random numbers as challenges that you sign with your registered public key.
If you do that, though, better have the server sign with _its_ public key also,
since you'd probably rather not just go signing any random number anybody
hands you.  And what if there's a man in the middle there helping you log on...?

Unfortunately, it's quite simple, if your only intent is to get the keys,
and not to use it as a way to increase NSA leverage...
Carl Ellison's web page points out the simple version of this,
and it's easy to extend to make it more reliable.
1) Have the NSA/NIST/DEA/etc. generate public keys for their GAK agents.
2) Have each session-key-transfer encrypt a copy of the session key with
the public key of the GAK agent, and send it at the beginning of the connection.
3) To make it more robust, have the recipient of the session key also encrypt the session key with the GAK key and send it back,
so that a conformist receiver can rat the key even if the sender didn't.
(takes a little protocol support to make sure the sender doesn't mind
getting it echoed back to her.)
Unlike Steven Walker's fancy complex method (which Dorothy liked a lot),
this is simple and straightforward, and requires no validation by
the recipient.  (Both parties could send fakes, but they could
do that anyway.)  What it doesn't do is allow third parties to detect
whether the GAK field has the real session key in it or a fake,
but c'est la guerre.  You can even get fancier and support M-of-N splitting,
requiring M of N GAK agents to give out their keyparts; just do the
split and encrypt each piece with the corresponding GAK agent's public key.
This also works in a wide variety of environments (e.g. Diffie-Hellman).
You could also scrounge a few bits by using the GAK field as an IV if you need one.

a record of which coins have been spent and refuses to pay anybody
who tries to spend the same coin later; this almost forces you to use
on-line clearing solutions.  Chaum's blinding protocols
make it possible for the bank to sign a coin without being able to
trace it to the person withdrawing the coin, so she can spend it anonymously.
Another model uses the protocols Tom described which place a random chunk
of the spender's identity into the coin - one chunk gives away no information,
but two chunks have an extremely high probability of doing so - so you
can go prosecute the guilty double-spender later (or just debit her account
Then there are the non-anonymous models.

One way to deflect this attack is to encrypt the message for storage
using a symmetric-key algorithm with a randomly generated session key,
and send the session key to the recipient with the notification.
You still have 300 MB of planted kiddy-terrorist narcopornography on your

decrypt it because you don't have the key.  The Feds _could_ get the

your system to send the material to themselves (or a conveniently employed
child), but at least you're not storing it in plaintext.
More of a problem with this system is that it's only useful for terminal
remailers; to use it in the middle of a chain, the next remailer would
need to be configured to auto-accept such messages, or else your remailer
would need to have a list of known remailers and use direct delivery
for all mail sent to them.

Or hack the Web of Trust used to verify the server's identity.
It _is_ still a Web of Trust even if it's a fascistly-hierarchical tree;
as long as it's possible to get a certificate without heavy contractual
obligations, you can hack it, since the software has no way to check,
now that Netscape is being nice and open and allowing non-Verisign certs.
Remember that anybody can be a CA, and keys can be signed by multiple CAs.
        Verisign Business CA signs Carol's Certification Consultants' key.
        Carol signs Bob's Better Browser Business's key.          Bob runs a server, selling really cool web tools.
        Verisign Business CA signs Moriarty's Mallet Makers' key.
        Moriarty signs Mr. X's personna key (trust us.)
        Mr. X makes a key called Bob's Better Browser Business,
        looking suspiciously like the real thing, only it's
        signed by M
. X, and nobody bothered telling Bob about it.
        Alice, using Netscape, encounter's         and decides to order a Better Browser.  She gets Bob's public key
        and X.509 certificates by pressing a button, and receives a key
        and a pile of certs.  Since it's not a secure session yet, is Mr. X
        intercepting them and sending her _his_ key and cert for "Bob" and his
        personna key with cert from Moriarty and his key and cert from Verisign?
        So Mr. X rips off Alice and/or Bob somewhere here, and Alice decides
to sue
        Bob, who says "Hey, that's not my key, see my real set of certs",
        so they go off after Mr. X, who they can't find, and then go after
        Moriarty, who says "Hey, it's just a personna certificate; all I
        guaranteed was that I didn't sign more than one with the same name
on it",
        which in fact appears to be true, and while after one case you can't         be sure that there really wasn't a Mr. X somewhere, if three or four
        people start walking in saying Mr. X ripped them off using a key
        that Moriarty signed, maybe somebody'll think it's a movement...
And remember that if you can finesse a signature, you can fake a Diffie-Hellman
session with authenticated keyparts into tolerating your MITM attack, because
you can convince Alice's browser into accepting the fake key for Bob,
and as far as Bob knows, Alice is just another web-client that he doesn't
know from Adam.
Now, X.509 certs don't limit themselves to hierarchical or Web use, and most
advice on using them recommends limiting the depth of a tree/web that you're
willing to trust.  Unfortunately, X.509 certs don't even have a comment field,
much less a standardized "how much do you trust this person you're signing"
though I suppose you can cram a bit into the X.400/500-style name formats.
So if people want to really trust their digital signature system to prevent
forgeries, then either there's got to be a law demanding lots of government-
approved is-a-person nationalized ID card Internet Driver's License stuff, or else there's a market need for companies providing heavy-duty contractual backing for their key signatures (e.g. "In return for us signing your CA key with our high-trust CA key, you agree to accept $XM of liability for any misuse
of keys you sign with it and to force anybody whose key you sign to also sign
a contract like this one").  Probably a need for some standards to go with it.
There's also a need for browsers and any associated certificate checkers to
provide good user interfaces (so the _user_ can read the signature chain)
and good tools to help the user decide what to trust.  At minimum, the user
interface probably should support things like different required amounts of
trust for different categories of communication, e.g. business vs. personal
letters vs. politics vs. smuggling.
[This whole posting has been very annoying to write; I've just gone and
argued that you can munge an X.509 hierarchy back into the Web of Trust
and avoid the special-case treatment of Very Important CAs by just signing
the top nodes of a hierarchy yourself and treating them like any other
web-of-trust chain, and been thanking Netscape for allowing us to use
open protocols instead of depending on Big Organizational Infrastructures
that are run by the CON, and now I find myself posting a counter-example

it's at least the theory for pulling one off, so even if it doesn't get
me a T-shirt, at least it wins me a GIF of one :-) ]

While I haven't seen Verisign's various public keys posted to the net,
and didn't see them anywhere on their web page, I assume they're at least
508 bits long, and the ones for better-than-personna certification
(or at least Class 3) ought to be ~1024 bits long, unless they're limiting
themselves to 512 bits to support software that's limited by ITAR stupidity

For the moment, breaking a 512-bit key remains hard, though maybe within the

The better fake, which is much more possible, is to build a chain of

@_subject: Re: Certificate proposal 
I agree with you about hierarchies, and even RFC1422 doesn't really force you
to use hierarchy, much less a government-enforced one, though it clearly prefers it, and it definitely does support the concept of having a key signed
by more than one CA, at least for CA's keys.  The most important differences,
from my perspective, are
1) X.509 explicitly addresses Certificate Revocation Lists, though it
        isn't real precise about how they should be distributed, and the
        hierarchical approach isn't necessarily the best.  (Maybe put the         location of the preferred CRL for a key certificate in the cert itself?)
2) X.509 certificates, unlike PGP, only support once signer per certificate;
        this is a slight hierarchical bias, which forces you to haul around a         pile of certificates to have multiply signed keys, without specifying
        a syntax, so simple key-cert programs may not know what to do with
        multiples, and hence force hierarchy; the rest of us will just have
        to deal with multiply syntaxes.  But that's mainly a verbosity
        problem, duplicating Distinguished Names and key info.
3) Neither PGP nor X.509 (as documented in the RFC1422 and PKCS have any
        mechanism for additional information other than cramming it into
        the username, but supposedly X.509 Version 3 includes something?
Eventually, there may be a way to represent most of the attributes you want
to describe in some format, which I dare say will look _far_ uglier than
ASN.1 :-)
Binding a key to a text-string usually representing a person does give you
the slack to use other mechanisms rather than wait for the release of
For now, there do seem to be some kinds of attributes that would benefit from
better representations than a human-name plus free-form text, such as
"which application does the user want you to use this key for?" "how much
should I
trust the user's desire to have me use that key for that application?"
"how do I get this key's owner to give me money?" "does the key-holder have the authority to speak for a given organization/human/bank account?"
If you look at Verisign's DNs, or the text in my PGP keys, you'll see various
ugly attempts at this.
And then there's "WHICH person named Bill Stewart does this key belong to?"
For the latter, I'm interested in solutions other than "Social Security Number",
"Citizen-Unit Nationalized ID Card Number", etc.

No surprise; it's a tough job.  I don't expect my laptop to be
continuously on-line when I'm reading mail, and even on-line use
needs to be more realistic than saying "Everybody must use X.400".
Interesting.  Aside from the excessive cost of looking up cards in paper
which can be avoided by having checkstands validate on the store's backroom
computer system, on-line verification lets the card company not only
refuse stolen cards, but also dynamically refuse cards that have reached
their credit limits, which you can't do on a slow push-based offline system.
However, it's _very_ tough to spoof a credit-card verification system, because the checkout device uses phones or private networks to reach the authorization company, so the response that comes back saying yes/no/stolen
can be real dumb.  On the internet, the response needs to be signed,
though I suppose it could say "Key sssss at xxx authorized
key uuuuu today yyyy/mm/dd/hh:mm:ss, valid for up to $500", and you'd then have
to validate the key that signed it, etc....  On the other hand, you could
have the cert require multiple confirmations, e.g. both the bank and the
user have to authorize this use.
OBJECT IDs solve two problems - one is that you need some kind of format (yuk),
but the other is that fields to have mutually agreed on values to be meaningful,
and central registration is an easy way to implement it, as long as there's
a simple way to register things.  I hope it at least supports an OBJECTID
with parameters, e.g. "CreditLimitUSDollarsBankFoo integer"  rather than needing
excessively many OBJECTIDs "CreditLimit3700USDollarsBankFoo"?  As you say below,
there's certainly no need to use ASN.1 formats instead of readable ones...
Yeah.  I've decided, as an experiment, to start signing keys for pseudonyms,
though I haven't settled on how to deal with unauthenticated signatures
for realspace people (in the one case where I've been asked, the person
didn't have any independent signatures from other people, so so far I've
but I may re-evaluate and just do uniqueness.)

@_subject: Certificates, Attributes, Web of Trust 
Carl and I and others have been discussing whether the Web of Trust
ought to use certificates to tie keys to people or attributes.
It's taken a while to sink in, but I now think he's basically right :-) ;
on the other hand, it can also still be done using the ugly X.509 format.
This means that we can begin to go out and corrupt users who might otherwise
want Driver's Licenses for the Infotainment Superhighway into realizing
that the Net can give them _more_ privacy instead of less.
Yeah.  Consider a slightly-abused Distinguished Name for a checking or
credit card.
signed  /Title=Accountsigner/Org=FooBank/Country=com/ with key bbb
        signed  /Title=MasterKey/Org=FooBank/Country=Com/ with key mmm
                signed  /OU=Corporate/O=Verisign/Country=com/ with key vvv
When you sign a check/credit card today, your name and signature are there
as vague verification for the payee and bank that it's authentic; with digital
signatures, the fact that you can sign a note saying "Pay $X to $Y Signed aaa"
is all the verification they need, though the name business makes it easier
for them
to find what attributes the signer had and how to get the actual money...
Even the account number could be the public key instead, but that's pretty long.
(Credit cards may be a slight wrinkle, since there are lots of laws about them.)
What the name also gives you is a handle to hang marketing data on.  Sometimes,
you may have that data from the transaction (card cccccc wanted 5 plutonium
widgets sent to Resident, 1600 Penn.Ave, WashDC 20017), sometimes you've got
(card cccccc wants to receive results of a stock search at IP address
which is way less since that's just a Netcom port server :-)  So a credit card or checking account with just an account number and key
gives you
_far_ more privacy than a current conventional one - even if it's not the full
mathematically subpoena-proof privacy that Chaumian digicash could give.
And if your bank wants to offer extra privacy, it can let you create
sub-accounts -
send a request for "Create Sub-account Key SSS Account AAA Parameters
p1,p2,p3" signed aaa,
and it sends you a new certificate /Account=NewUnique with key SSS
signed by bbb.
So you can give everybody a different-looking check, at least if the cost is
[> Key signing "I use this name" vs. names not being able to sign "I use
this key"]
I still think you often want both directions, especially for privacy.
(For authentication, anybody who's got the attribute you want or claim will
often do;
for privacy, you really want to identify the _person_ you're talking to,
so the attribute "where the _real_ Carl Ellison gets his mail" is important.
Pseudonyms have an easier time of this, as long as they start using their keys
at the same time as their names.)

Cancellation is a sufficiently local-policy-dependent issue, and reasonably

the various news programs to hand cancellation requests off to an external

One approach is to add digital signature and verification capability
to News, at least to support cancels; doing this in an outboard
cancel-daemon is obviously easier.  RIPEM-SIG is a signature-only
version of RIPEM which is exportable, probably just in binaries. The local cancel-daemon could accept cancellation requests that were signed
by anybody on the list of locally-approved cancellers; one site could accept
cancels from Cancelmoose, newsgroup moderators, and Helena Kobrin;
another could do authors only.  This would, of course, encourage people

MD5 produces a very random 128-bit output; you're not going to collect
any appreciable fraction of the 2**128 possible M2s.  As long as M1 is
even as simple as MD5(messageid,passphrase), it's pretty open territory.
Targeted attacks, however, are still possible, as long as M1 retains
the form MD5(known-stuff, passphrase) - assuming the user uses one of the
few hundred million wimpiest passphrases, you can search that moderately fast;
if you're willing to burn some resources, you might be able to take out
most of alt.religion.spam, at least until people use better passphrases.
The amount of work depends somewhat on whether you use
MD5(known-stuff, passphrase) or MD5(passphrase,known-stuff).
For the first case, the cracker would calculate the MD5 context
after doing known-stuff (once) and then grind away on passphrases.
For the second, the cracker could pre-compute a table of MD5 context
for the wimpy password list, and then add known-stuff to each.
Since known-stuff is probably longer than passphrases here,
the latter is probably more secure for this application.

If everybody in the world has a 1024-bit key, that's 750 GB;
that's not bad at all by the time everybody in the world would have one,

Today, for 750 GB, you'd probably have tape in your system, or optical jukebox.
But not everybody has one; on the other hand, I suppose individuals
in well-heeled countries might end up with dozens of their own.
On the other hand, the number of 1024-bit primes is something like
2^1023/log(2^1024) (if I remember right), or roughly 2^1013.
The probability of two independent uniformly distributed primes
matching is about 2^1023/2^32, which is still an astoundingly
mindbogglingly LARGE number.  If you've got 1024 bits of entropy
in your input process, there will not _be_ any matches.
(If people insist on using sources of randomness like clocks or
user names, the chances are a lot higher....)
Now, for 128-bit hashes, whether it's MD5 or just the near-bottom 128 key bits,
by the time you get 2^64 of them together, you've got a 50% chance of a match.
Not a problem, since you'll not likely need that many, even for the 2^33 people

While normally I'd agree with Lucky Green and say that a good encryption
algorithm's strength is independent of its input data, there are exceptions.
The description of Privasoft's method on their web page sounded like* it
broke up a fax image into little squares and shuffled them around based on
some proprietary (hence presumably weak) algorithm, somewhat like feeding
them to a shredder or puzzle-box, then put them in a file you can ship
with regular fax software or decrypt yourself.  If that's the case,
and if the squares are sufficiently big to have enough pixels for fax
software to compress decently, then it's weak no matter _how_ strong
the encryption algorithm that shuffles them is, because you can piece together
matching edges like a jigsaw puzzle, or like a bunch of Iranian students
with American Embassy shredded documents.  Using computers is a lot easier,
since you've got precise images of print - most edges will match pretty well
with the edges of the adjacent squares, and you can jigsaw the parts that
still need work if you get too many multiple matches.  A much stronger way to encrypt faxes is to do the Group 3 (or G4) compression
first, then encrypt using a real algorithm, ship the (now-useless-for-fax)
encrypted bits, decrypt, and read with your favorite fax-image viewer.
Or, of course, take the raw file you would have done this with, which is much
smaller than the fax-compressed image, encrypt it, ship, decrypt, and view,

It occurred to me that the authors of the US Constitution had direct experience with the equivalent of mandatory certification hierarchies
for legally acceptable digital signatures.
They called it "The Stamp Act".  If you wanted to make a legal document, such as a contract or will, it needed to be on paper with a tax stamp on it; I forget if this was
a watermark or a stick-on stamp, but you could only get it from the authorities.
They didn't like it.  There was also a few-percent sales tax on tea around
that time.  They didn't like that either :-)
 WHAT  is your name?
 WHAT  is your certificate number?

This doesn't necessarily eliminate certificates - while you have a signed
statement from Alice's key that she uses Bank Account X, and a signed statement
from Alice's key authorizing transfer of $D from Bank Account X to Bank
Account Y,
the Bank, or a customer, may refuse to accept the request unless there's a signed statement from the Bank's key that Alice's key uses Account X.
None of these need Alice's name, or for that matter the Bank's, as long as
also a signed attribute statement from the Bank's key that it's a bank, etc. The meaning of the certificates changes a bit, but there's still a certificate
from the bank binding Alice's Key to Alice's Bank Account.

Doing it _right_ is not a trivial job.  Consider disk controllers that
map out bad blocks so the OS never needs to see them - if you're trying
to remove highly classified data, the fact that Diskwipe won't ever see them
might be a serious problem, even if it is close enough for government work.
For a more realistic scenario, consider Stacker and other disk-compression
you don't know what physical blocks the file was written on, or whether
the logical blocks of the file will actually write to the same physical blocks.
In some cases you can assume that it probably won't.  You also can't expect to
write large blocks of 1s or 0s over the disk, because disk compression will
turn them into small blocks with run-lengths or equivalent.  (Writing PRNG
random noise will do, or you can generate counter-based patterns that may work,
or do something cryptographically strong if you want to take the time.)

@_subject: Re: Certificate proposal 
What I was trying to get at with this post was that the assertion that key-
centered communications probably won't require certificates is incorrect.
As far as privacy goes, this set of keys and certifications lets you create
private communications (using signed DH, etc.) with the entity that owns
the private key for Bank Account X.  No, you don't know if that entity
is really Alice or really MITM; in fact you don't know Alice's name, if it's
done right.  You just know that the Bank says it will honor requests for money
from Bank Account X (assuming you know where to find the Bank, which is a
but similar problem.)  So assuming you're selling politically correct
widgets and not
pharmaceuticals or financial privacy consulting services, you probably don't
care too much about who's on the other end - the person who's giving you
the money is the person you want to be talking to.
I'm not trying to define away the MITM problem - I think there _are_ times you
want to know for sure who you're talking to - but I think there are also a lot
of times that you really don't care, as long as you have continuity and
access to reputations of long-persisting identities, where the key is often
enough identification.
In the case of the Bank, the reason you trust the Bank isn't that you know
them physically (though it was interesting when I started dealing with a
local bank where the tellers knew me by name after only two or three visits);
knowing your local Savings and Loan by name doesn't guarantee you can get any
money out of them if there's a bank run, nor does it really guarantee that they
won't embezzle the funds and head for Argentina.  The reason you trust them
is that they (in this case the "they" identified by their key) are doing
dealings with a lot of people and it's more profitable not to abscond.
And the reason you know it's really the Bank and not MITM is that they've
always identified themselves by their key from the beginning.
Just like the credit card who's owner we've been calling Alice has.
And because you've successfully withdrawn money from the Bank before,
and because you're clearing Alice's credit card transaction reasonably promptly.
Checks and credit cards are especially good examples for this - the current
systems need your name on them, because your name and signature are the
closest they have to an authentication system.  However, with digital
the fact that you can sign a document verifiable by the public key is
all the authentication that's needed; your name isn't.  If the card has an
account number for convenience, and Alice substitutes Carol's account number
for hers on a statement, her signature won't match the public key the bank
wants on the request, and it'll bounce.  (In this case, the certificate
from the bank would probably include the account number as well as the key,
but it's not critical for on-line systems, just more efficient.)

I think you're probably right, though a one-way secure channel is enough.
If Alice has a trusted copy of the Bank's key, she can open her account and get her key certified by them without them having to trust her key (modulo little details like government requirements that banks get positive identification for their accountholders.)
With online clearing, you'd be able to tell because Alice's check cleared
and your bank (which we're assuming you've got a secure channel to)
says you've got the money.  Or in the case of digicash, because the cash
Alice's bank gave you was good.
Maybe not, but it would sure help.
Hmmm.  That one's interesting; he pays fakes everything for a while,

@_subject: Re: Netscape Crack 
Netscape uses a random session key, which feeds that 40-bit encryption.
How does it get a random session key without bothering the user to type
in random numbers?  By using the sources of randomness available to it,
like the system clock and process id.  Well, since you know when a message was
sent, you know what time it was (to the second), and there aren't very many
possible values of microseconds available.  There also aren't a lot of possible
processids, especially when you can run a process on the machine or convince
sendmail into telling you.  So instead of having 2^40 numbers to brute-force,
there were fewer than 2^30, often more like 2^20.  That's pretty fast.
The third crack was to notice that Netscape isn't very careful with array bounds
(in true C fashion), allowing you to push stuff on the stack by handing it a URL
with a very long name.  If you're careful, you can put interesting stuff on the
stack, so it does more than just crash in an ugly fashion.
However, three's a charm, and it's now time to Hack Microsoft, especially since
Microsoft has been saying bad things about Netscape, when almost every
product in a Microsoft tool is wimpy beyond repair, and when their newest and
niftiest stuff also has 40-bit keys for export versions, with out even as
much salt
as Netscape used.

Cryptography can cause far more interesting kinds of havoc than scaring
a few marketroids about crackers cracking their market shares,
or scaring a few spooks that they might not be able to eavesdrop on
the American public.  Cryptography is a way of changing the balance of
power about who owns your personal information.  Computers are very good
at centralizing and combining information - once something's in a major
it's easy for the people who own databases to compare them with other databases,
so your Social Security Number and Driver's License Number and credit cards
and phone numbers and TRW credit report all pretty much tell people what
you're doing, what kind of lifestyle you lead, where you're travelling,
what magazines you read, where to find you if they want, where your money is,
what kind of junk mail to send you, whether your house is worth burglarizing,
whether you'd be a good target for the draft or a tax audit, etc.
Not much you can do about it except not give people information,
and that's getting tougher to do, especially if you like conveniences of
modern American life like employee-style jobs and renting or buying houses
or having a driver's license when the cops stop your car for no good reason.
But with cryptography, you can structure transactions so that people get all
the information they need to do business with you (if you want them to),
and none of the information they don't need.  Imagine if your credit smart-card
didn't have your name on it (because only you have the PIN), and gave out a
different number every time you used it (but Visa doesn't mind, because
they know who you are.)  Imagine if, instead of having one master SSN that you
write on every bloody form you fill out in your life, you have a list of
tax id numbers, and can get more if you need them, so everybody who needs
to send the IRS a chunk of your money can do so, but the numbers aren't tied
except back at the tax office, where nobody's going to care until you retire.
(That doesn't even take cryptography, though it helps.)  Imagine if people
started thinking that your own private information was your own, and didn't
_need_ to see three kinds of picture ID to let you rent a mailbox or a car,
because you could use crypto methods to give them the information they need
to charge you for the car if you rip it off, without all the other baggage.
And imagine if all you need to do business is that barcode tattooed on your arm,
which you can wave by the machines anywhere you go, for everything you do.
Crypto's the alternative.
Now, as far as the things you first asked about go, the theoretical stuff
_is_ pretty neat, and has finally given me an excuse to go study up on
number theory, and scaring the public about weaknesses of the computer
products they use is something the mass media and legislators like better than many of us do (though having your friends get their pictures in
Wired and the New York Times is kind of fun...) - it'd be nice if the
people who make popular software would take security seriously,
instead of putting out some of the thoughtlessly weak stuff that they do.
Sometimes it takes a 2x4 to do the job; sometimes the press just overreacts.
I do occasionally hang out with people who have the police watch them
because their politics aren't correct (whether to the left, right, or deep
or because they like recreational chemicals that are safer than tobacco
and alcohol, or just because they're weird.  That's wrong, and people
have a right to their privacy.  (Hasn't stopped me from offering the
Philadelphia Police Red Squad coffee when they were watching a convention
I was at (they'd brought their own :-) - but those guys really still are
in business.)

the chain of digital mixes and crypto he uses to operate alt.money.laundry,
or follow the money when _he_ tries to deposit it.  On the other hand,
he could operate a strictly legitimate business, selling financial assets such as bearer bonds or low-commission lottery tickets, or converting
funds between different e-banks, or simply offering anonymous bank accounts
with currencies in multiple denominations - Bob can set up an account
with Ed's Eurocurrency Exchange in the name "Public Key nnnnn",
deposit his $15, and withdraw US$14.95 worth of Yen or Deutschmarks or
Aside from Bob's need to trust Ed, and his need to trust Alice not to
double-spend (since laundering used bills is much harder than laundering
marked bills) it first looked to me like Ed has a serious risk that he'd
be nabbed by the Feds as soon as he tried to spend the bills, so he has
to trust Bob not to be spending ransom money or pharmaceutical profits.
But as near as I can tell, _any_ merchant has that risk, because there's
no way for Ed to distinguish between cash that Bob withdrew himself
and cash that Bob got from someone else.  Does this mean that anybody
who sells goods to anonymous clients is automatically a money-launderer?
If so, either the bogus money-laundering laws have to go (yay!) or laws against selling to anonymous clients will get written (boo!) or selective enforcement and entrapment will become increasingly popular, leading merchants to refuse to do anonymous business just to defend themselves
against extortionists\\\\\\\\\\\\legitimate needs of law enforcement?

Well, one obvious example is MIT, which not only makes PGP available to

though ostensibly not everyone else in the world.  Your University isn't
required to be reading students' and employees' private email anyway,
(though it can get away with it by announcing it as official policy),
so not being able to read it because of PGP is just fine - if anything it
may reduce their legal liability by offering students the option of having
truly private email, where sysadmins won't even be able to read bouncemail
or other fragments of messages left around when mailers break.
On the other hand, I'm guessing that usf.edu is in the USA?  If so, there may be ITAR considerations - are any of your students non-US citizens
without Green Cards?  Offensive as it sounds, it may not be legal to let
them use a copy of PGP that you provide (though it's perfectly legal for
them to import copies from the UK for their own use.)  There _are_ privacy-
protecting programs you can let them use, such as the next edition of Netscape,
which has 40-bit RC4, and you can use digital signatures from packages like
RIPEM-SIG, which is a signature-only subset of RIPEM that's approved for export.
Since Netscape 2 will be using X.509 certifications, which RIPEM uses,
you or your students can do things like building good friendly user interfaces
to the current character-menu certification chains that RIPEM provides

No.  The basic Chaum Digicash method looks like this:
1) Alice creates a number of a recognizable form (Chaum's 1985 CACM paper
uses n1n2n3...n64n1n2n3....n64, i.e. a 64-bit number concatenated with itself).
2) Alice blinds the number and sends it to the bank (along with some request
for withdrawing money from her account or payment in other coin or whatever.)
3) The bank signs the number and sends it back.
4) Alice unblinds the coin; now it's good, recognizably signed, and untraceable.
5a) Alice gives the coin to Bob, who deposits it; the bank records the coin
and in case of double-spending, the first person to the bank wins.
This is useful for on-line transactions, or off-line where everyone trusts
each other.
OR 5b) Alice gives the coin to Bob using a complicated cut&choose protocol that
doesn't give away her identity if it's only used once, but if she also gives the
same coin to Carol with the same protocol, Bob and Carol can identify Alice
with probability 1 - 1/2**n, for some adequately large n.  This is more work,
but you can use it for off-line transactions where you don't trust Alice
not to double-spend.  The protocol doesn't say what to do to Alice if you
catch her
cheating; depending on the environment you can debit her account or sue her etc.
6) Bob now has a number, signed by the Bank of Foo, which he can either give
to them
to deposit or get cash or use for highway toll (if Foo is really the highway
or give to somebody else to spend (which is a little messy in the cut&choose
The basic protocol doesn't say anything about what a valid coin looks like;
you could use the example in Chaum's paper or a long string followed by
a checksum or whatever.  You _could_ put the payee's name account number
in the string as the 64-bit "random" number, or even put both payer and payee.
The bank could insist on that sort of thing if they wanted.
If I remember right, the version in the Digicash trial left you the choice
of filling in a specific payee or using " for bearer-payable coins.
The bank marks the coin spent upon deposit.
I don't know if their merchant-client software lets you do this or not,
but it's just a matter of implementation, not protocol.
Your problem isn't trusting Carol not to get you in trouble,
it's trusting Alice not to spend the coin again.
Hardware-based agents are interesting because they make it easier to
enforce double-spending prevention in off-line systems, and to offer
better anonymity because you've got more trust that the person didn't double-spend.  Stefan Brands has done a lot of work on this.
In on-line systems you can check whether a coin's been spent already
by depositing it - the problem is that on-line systems aren't
always convenient for many applications (e.g. newspaper machines),
and the costs of communication for an on-line system may be higher
than the cost of a sufficiently smart smart-card.

.... Wiener's design was about two orders of magnitude cheaper than Wayner's
and the DEC guy's designs, which were in turn far cheaper than any previous.
But it's a believable design, and could probably be done within a factor of
two-three of his cost predictions; "system costs" need to include things
like wiretapping equipment to steal and record the data to be cracked,
and government employees to operate it, and bureaucrats and politicians
to tell them what to do and who to target, and lots of real estate for them all.
But to reach two or more orders of magnitude cost increase,
I'd think you'd need a far bigger collection of cracking machines
that Wiener's - perhaps to crack a few hundred keys per day.
Interesting comments on banks' use of DES for authentication rather than
privacy....  of course, if the government wants to tap banks' conversations,
it can generally just demand that the banks tell them the information,
at least for US-based and other cooperative banks.

dividend or interest payments to owners* rather than inside the business itself,
substantially reducing the accounting workload of businesses**.
But it's still very attractive to governments, not only as a lever for

to force businesses to report wages payed to employees - I don't know if
law.miami.edu is a taxable business, but for most employers, if they don't
report the wages they paid to their employees, but do report all their
revenue, they get taxed on the additional profit, instead of the employee
getting hit with the tax; most people I know who've been paid "under the table"
have been working for small businesses that are also not reporting cash
Of course, if a business isn't _spending_ money on employees, but is just
contracting for work performed by an Anguillan corporation, they still have
receipts for expenses, and the financial arrangements between the Anguillan
corporation and any of its US employees aren't really their concern....

In a separate article, Clark posted estimates that ranged from

the average victim for (say) 3 months, that's 4 times as many victims....

The FBI now says they only want to tap 1% of simultaneous capacity,
not 1% of total number of lines.  On the other hand, the actual utilization
of the telephone network is also much lower than the number of lines -
back when I was a voice-telephony geek, our estimates for busy-hour
phone utilization were about 1/12 for residential and 1/6 for business
(3 and 6 hundred call-seconds per hour); that was before widespread
use of fax machines, modems, or LANs, so business utilization has
probably increased.  Equipped trunk capacity was typically enough to
have a maximum of 1% blocking during busy hour, which means a certain
amount of margin over average calls in progress, and switch capacity depends radically on technology - some kinds of switches are non-blocking,
while others have various capacity limits.

Either PGP is a strong enough cryptosystem that you don't need
to use a one-time-pad, or it's not, in which case you need better
randomness than PGP will give you (I doubt it), or you have special
applications for which PGP is impractical (like decrypting small amounts
of data on a very wimpy machine in an environment that you can easily
distribute OTP keys (for using ONCE ONLY)).  Or you're just doing it for fun.
A OTP can give you provably secure cryptography, given that the pad
is only used once, and has real randomness behind it.  If it's only
pseudo-random numbers (e.g. generated from some algorithm), then
it's as crackable as the source of random numbers, and therefore no
longer provably secure.  And of course, if you use it more than once,
or your pad distribution isn't secure, you lose.
Two alternatives - spend 5 minutes writing it in a language you know well,
or pick a language you don't know very well and use it as an excuse
to learn the language.  It's slightly more complex than "hello, world",
since you need to input data from two files and use XOR.  The big problem with OTPs (other than getting people to use the pads
ONLY ONCE, since they're otherwise hosed) is shipping them around;
the traditional method is guys with briefcases handcuffed to their arms....
Large quantities of good random numbers are hard to find.  Small quantities
can come from dice or throwing darts at the stock market pages;
the zener diode or radioactivity methods people have been discussing
will produce larger quantities if you've got the equipment.
If you've got one of those new radio-tuner boards for your PC, tuning it
to an unused station might be quite decent, and we've just been discussing
whether video is any good.
With many of these sources, it's probably worth grinding the numbers through
some sort of compression or encryption algorithm just to smudge over any
periodicity or other structure to it.

Pointing the camera at a snowy TV or out the window or at a cat playing

@_subject: /dev/random - using up entropy? 
The discussions of what to do when /dev/random has handed out all of its
available entropy have assumed that entropy gets used up; I'd like to propose that maybe it doesn't, at least in the computational-complexity
sense that says that you don't have the computational power around to
calculate the information inside /dev/random from the output,
giving a sort of "computational entropy" that reflects not only the uncertainty you have because of randomness but also the uncertainty
you have because of your computational limitations.
Most of the designs I've seen look like this:
        A Reservoir of entropy R = R1....Rn, where n is large, 1024 or 4096
        An input stream I = I1....Ik, which is mixed into R
        A mixing function F which is used to mix R <= F(R,I)                 for some chunk of I, possibly empty.
        A hash function H, typically MD5.
        An output O = O1...Om = H(R), and E gets mixed after every output.
                (These are capital-o, not zero...)
The entropy E of the reservoir E before an output is
        -SUM(all X) p(X) log p(X)
where X is an event R1=x1, R2=x2 ... Rn=Xn
which is equal to n, assuming the Ri are iid equiprobable 0 or 1.
After an output, the entropy is
        - SUM p(X | H(R)=O) log p(X|H(R)=O)
which works out to n-m, since p(X) is zero if H(R)!=O, and 2**m/2**n if it does.
So that says you use up m bits of entropy if you get m bits of good output.
However, what I'd like to suggest is that you don't, from the perspective
of a user who doesn't have direct access to the reservoir R of random bits.
For that user, p(X|H(R)=O) is the same as p(X) or P(X|H(R)=O'), because
the user is neither able to invert H, nor to enumerate all possible R,
nor to calculate anything useful based on multiple outputs, since the
reservoir R is shuffled between outputs; even a simple circular shift
may be enough.   This doesn't apply to the case where n is 32 or 48
and the hash function produces n-bit outputs, or even m<<n bit outputs,
because that maybe be inverted or brute-forced, but it seems to apply
for the case where n is sufficiently large and the hash is good.
If the hash is simpler than MD5, it may apply anyway, since the hash
produces far fewer bits than its input, as long as the hash and the
mixing function don't give away any information about the reservoir
between successive outputs.
This would suggest that /dev/random ought to have a mode that says
"give me output of whatever quality you have available",
and that it ought to be OK to use it, as long as the reservoir has been seeded with sufficient high-entropy input to have decent randomness.

your security comes from algorithm quality and is theoretically crackable

[ Hmmm, maybe I'd better get this message out quickly, before it expires... :-]
Decryption is equivalent to knowing a secret plus doing some work.
There are two ways to make information available/unavailable -
by depending on calculations from known data, or by having people
agree to publish/delete it.  The former method is trustable,
but doesn't have time built in to it - either you know stuff or you don't.
The latter method is harder to trust - you can build contractual mechanisms
to encourage people to keep their commitments, and use crypto methods like
splitting shared secrets to limit the impact of some of them not keeping them -
but it's basically not cryptographic.  Getting people to keep information secret for a while and then publish
is possible; that's within their control.  Getting people to keep information
public, and then delete all the copies they own is possible, but if the
information is _public_, anybody in the world could have a copy - deleting
it requires finding them all, and getting them all to agree to delete it.
That's _much_ harder.
You could build a system where an escrow agent keeps a piece of information
private, but available upon request, and deletes it on a certain date.
That lets you know that _if_ nobody's asked for the information by then,
and the agent has done its job, that nobody else will be able to decrypt it.
Again, you can secret-share among multiple agents to decrease the impact
of defaults (either failure-to-delete or failure-to-deliver.)
A related approach is for the agent to provide a service of decrypting data
encrypted with the agent's public key, and agreeing only to decrypt data
before or after some date specified in the message.
Another technique you can use is to for the agent to keep the data until
paid for delivery; the retrieval token includes a digital check
with an expiration date.  In this case, you're trusting the bank to not honor the check after its expiration date, and the escrow agent not to
deliver the data without getting paid.  For this service, you want checks
rather than cash - if the check goes stale, the money is still in your account.

For penny-a-page on-line services, unless ecash transaction costs are

No calculation required, just an on-line lookup for double-spending

As always, it depends on the attacks people can make on your system.
For Unix password files, the cyphertext is often available, the plaintext is
and the key (your password) is known to be eight or fewer characters.  If there's reasonable suspicion that your password contains multiples of one or more characters, and that they're mostly letters, you're toast against a good brute-force attack, because the search space is fairly small.
Using, say, a pair of 4-letter words is an even worse idea...
For PGP passphrases, the cyphertext is generally unavailable, but assuming
you're dealing with Bad Guys resourceful enough to try to crack your passphrase,
they've probably got the file.  The plaintext may be partially known (PGP data
files have some structure; RTFM to find out how much) and partially unknown (your secret key) but guesses can be validated (slowly).  The structure of the IDEA key is that your passphrase is hashed by MD5, and the 128-bit output
used as an IDEA key to encrypt the formatted secret key.  Since brute-forcing
IDEA with the 128-bit MD5 output is unrealistic, the alternative is to feed
candidate keys through the whole process.  So how much entropy does your
passphrase have,
and how many guesses are they willing to attempt?  How much does word-repeating
affect it?  How much entropy depends on your taste in passphrases, your
and how much you're willing/able to memorize without resorting to writing it
The MD5 effectively limits entropy to 128 bits, but you can cram as much as
you want
into the passphrase and MD5 will crunch it all down, so repeated words can only
cause problems if they make you decide you've got enough entropy in the
before you do.  If your passphrase is "FOO BAR", and you're known to be a
lengthening it to "FOO FOO BAR BAR BAR Skidoo" may improve it some, though
it's not
as good as "Eric Woodruff Kintetsu Espada 1145 Lutheran", to pick six words
randomly from the Tri-Valley phone book.  But if you eliminate obvious material,
and word-doubling lets you pick a more complex passphrase than you might
have otherwise
used, go ahead - it's not going to make the MD5 any more attackable.

I don't know how connected it is to Indonesia or East Timor, which is
too underdeveloped to be very active on the net, and has the added problem
that activists are heavily watched.
The Indonesian military recruitment process is unfortunately not something
that crypto can affect much, except by keeping political activist's identities
private so they're not targets.  Basically, the draft board knocks on your

and it matched the name in your cypherpunks posting.
If you're asking why I certified a key used by a nym, I started doing that
a couple months ago, as an experiment about what it means to certify keys
and how to provide better continuity for keys used by nyms, and signing
yours seemed like an appropriate thing to do (since you chose to name
your key as belonging to the same string you signed your message with.)
I have the policy of only signing one key for a given namestring with the key
I use for signing nyms, so it gives a certain evidence of uniqueness as well as the timestamping effect.
Since you also commented on cluttering up namespace, I didn't send the key
to the keyserver myself; that's up to you.
Has it been a wildly successful experiment?  Well, no :-)  But I've at least

the winners split a jackpot that's based on current and/or previous players' losses\\\\\\ ticket purchases.  The former kind, such as numbers games,
works because the expected payoff is less than the ticket price -
you can make it honest through techniques like bit committment,
but as Tim points out, the kind of people who care about things like
bit committment know enough math to know these games are money-losers.
Perhaps you can attract some people with a flashy user interface,
but it's not like really being in Vegas with booze and babes and blinkenlights
and incessant noise and stale smoke and Siegfried and Roy's tiger act.
On the other hand, lotto systems are too easy to cheat with anonymous payees.
Sure, you can make sure that any genuine winners get paid, but you can also throw in the occasional ringer to share the prize,
and nobody can tell unless you do it often enough that people start checking
the probabilities.  Bit committment doesn't prevent this kind of cheating;
it just verifies that you knew the number in advance (oops :-).
You need some sort of externally verifiable source of random numbers;
an MD5 hash of the Wall Street Journal stock price web page from
a few hours after the last bet and digital timestamping or something
might be good enough.  (Of course, a single unified stock price page
becomes even less meaningful with large volumes of on-line anonymous private
stock trading.)
(The pre-digital version of this scam was to hire some poor old grandma from the
South Bronx as the shill, since nobody'd accuse Granny of conspiring with
the mob.
It wasn't really enough then, and now Granny may be using anonymous digicash
for her payoffs...)
Another way to cheat progressive lotto systems is to not report all
your ticket sales each week, since anonymity makes it excessively hard
to verify.  Committing to the list of all the numbers bet almost works,
but you could still skim a few percent by reporting smaller sales of
popularly chosen numbers, with the risk that you've occasionally got to
pay all six real winners 1/5 of the jackpot if you're unlucky.
You can't get around this by using large enough numbers that there's
a small probability of duplication, because that also reduces the probability of a win too far, and because some folks are going to pick
7777777...777 regardless of how many bits long their bet is.
Government lotteries are surprisingly free from this sort of problem.
Not because governments are excessively honest, of course :-)
Employee pay isn't generally dependent on profitability, there's enough public scrutiny that it's harder for employees to cheat
for their own gain (rather than their lotto organizations'),
and (perhaps most important) they're already taking such an appallingly
high cut of the winnings that there's no need for regular cheating -
it's one of the efficiencies possible in a highly unnatural monopoly.

Your mileage may vary, of course. There were two different problems found.  The first was a straightforward

I give Netscape a lot of credit for the way they've handled things so far;
their US commercial version supports strong crypto (modulo a few bugs :-),
and interoperates with their free exportable version, which is itself
far stronger than a minimal 40-bit version could have been.
And they're adding secure email to the new version.
And (while they can't officially say this, of course) anybody overseas
can pirate the strong-crypto version if 40 bits aren't enough.
PGP gave anybody who wanted to do a bit of work the ability to
do trusted communications, but it's still not widely used because
it does take extra work; the most important things it's done have
been to raise public awareness and make it obvious to everybody
that the cat's out of the bag, which also pressured the government
into dealing with the issue.  Netscape is putting built-in strong crypto
in the hands of tens of millions of people; fait accompli like that
make it much harder for governments to impose stupid and offensive rules.
Maybe Netscape will come out with GAKed versions for export to nosy-governmented
countries like France and the US; as long as the main version has secure
communications, and they're open about how their crypto really works,
we can talk securely domestically, and other folks can pirate them to
use instead of GAKware.  If the government wants to pay extra to support
special hardware crypto modules for their own use, and the modules do GAK,
that's an internal problem (as long as we can subpoena their records.)
Of course, in case the main US versions ever have GAK as a default,
I do reserve the right to flame Netscape again :-)
I think it's that "Netscape is now in a financial position that pushes
them to care more about making some profits to justify their appallingly
high stock price so they're more likely to lose big bucks if
they don't sell out, and I should have bought it at $70..."

@_subject: Re: Timing Attack Paper 
Briefly, most public-key calculations are _slow_, and use
512-2048-bit numbers which get represented as arrays of
machine integers. The amount of time they take depends on the values
you're multiplying together, especially because the algorithms
used to do the arithmetic less slowly take shortcuts whenever
possible to avoid unnecessary work.  If you watch the time
that it takes for a machine to do calculations using its private
keys, for some algorithms you can guess a bit or two of the key.
If you're clever, and have the ability to feed the victim
different numbers for it to calculate on (e.g. make a bunch
of connections using Diffie-Hellman), you can guess different
bits each time, and gradually get the whole thing.
It helps to watch this a number of times to get better statistics,
so you can tell what's real calculation and what's just speed-randomness.
Obviously, it also helps if you're running a program on the same
machine as the target you're trying to hit, but you can still gain
some information if you're running across a network and having to
estimate random network delays.  In these cases, you just have to watch longer to get stats.
A common algorithm for doing modular exponentiation (the core
of the Diffie-Hellman and RSA algorithms) looks like this:
To calculate y**x mod m  (all this arithmetic is multiple-precision)
(and maybe there's an off-by-one error or two in this :-)
This uses successive squaring to do the calculation in log2(x) time
instead of just doing x multiplies by y, which would be very slow
since x is typically 500-1000 bits long...  Remember that
multiplying two 1024-bit numbers typically involves multiplying two
arrays of 32 numbers 32 bits long, which takes 32*32 or 1024 multiply steps.
And modulo calculations are also slow.
        prod = 1
        square = y
        log2x = number of bits in x
        for i = 1 to log2x+1  {
                if (x odd) then {
                        prod = prod * square
                        if ( prod > m ) then prod = prod mod m
                }
                # else if (x even), don't bother
                square = square * square
                if (square > m) square = square mod m
                x = x / 2
        }
You can figure out the timing for the squaring calculations yourself.
Since you get to pick y, you can manipulate it to guess a bit about
how long x is, and notice from the different timings how many
times there was a prod*square calculation (which tells you how many
bits were odd), as well as how many prod mod m calculations.
You can get a certain amount of defense by keeping around prod1 and prod2,
and calculating prod1 = prod1 * square (the real value) for odd
and prod2 = prod2 * square (a dummy you'll discard later) for even,
and doing something useful to obscure the mod m calculations,
like keeping a dummy around to divide if prod1 or prod2 is less than m.
Aside from slowing things down by 50%, if you're not careful, there's
still information that leaks from the timing.  For other algorithms, sometimes the calculations you've got to do timings
on are more subtle, like DES, but you can still often guess things,
and Paul gives a bunch of calculations for these.  They're more statistical,
since the effects you're chasing are subtler, but you still get information.

@_subject: Potential defense against timing attack on Diffie-Hellman 
The timing attack on Diffie-Hellman depends on assumptions
about what multiplications are being made, and in what order.
But you don't need to do them in order.
The standard approach to calculating Y**x mod m is to calculate
        Y[1] = Y, Y[2] = Y**2, Y[3] = Y**4, .... Y[logx] = Y**(logx), and while you're doing this keep a running total r[i], where         r[i] = (bit[x,i]) ? (r[i-1]*Y[i]) : r[i-1]
all arithmetic modulo m (and all indices possibly off by one :-)
This may be a bit memory-intensive for a smartcard, but there's
no need to calculate these partial products in order; precompute
the Y[i], pick a random permutation of 1..(logx), and compute
the partial products in that order.  This still leaks the number
of 0 and 1 bits in x, but it doesn't say what they are.
You probably still should multiply r[i-1]*Y[i] whether you're going to need it or not; I don't think the method hides enough
information otherwise, but that needs more analysis.
Cost - mostly administrative, plus the memory, since keeping track
of permutations of small integers is cheap relative to bignum multiplication and modulo calculations.  You also need a random number generator of some sort; LFSRs seem to be an easy way to do permutations on the fly, so seed them with something decent.
How effective is it?  I'm not sure - I'd need to do a lot more analysis
than I've done so far, and the long version of Paul's paper would
help :-)  But at first glance it looks like it makes it much harder;
no two calculations are in the same order, so feeding the system
related Y = g**y mod m each time doesn't tell you much.
As a further annoyance to the listener, split the permutation
at random into two or three pieces, compute their products separately,
and then multiply those partial products together.  (Don't try this at
home without analyzing whether it may leak more information than it
conceals...)  At very minimum, take two numbers you've got lying
around and multiply them every once in a while :-)

Follow-on defense for low-memory smartcards:  This is a bit ugly
and I'm not sure how much it protects your information, but it's some
help for systems that can't store 1024 partial products 1024 bits long,
which smartcards generally can't be expected to do :-)
Pick k random values K1, K2, .. Kk, where k is some medium-sized number; probably about 10 though maybe more would be better.
Calculate Y[i] = Y**2**i, i=1...log x, as before, but instead of calculating
        r[i] = r[i-1] or r[i-1]*Y[i], i=1...logx,
calculate separate subproducts for i={1...K1}, {K1+1...K2}, ... {Kk...logx},
and then multiply those subproducts together.  The easy way to do this is
keep second running product P, and whenever you reach Kj, set P = P*r[i],
and set r[i]=1 for the next round of (Kj)+1...K(j+1).  You still need to
calculate r[i-1]*Y[i] whether you're using it or not.
For added obnoxiousness, at the cost of about 50% more calculation, you could
calculate Yinv = Y**-1 mod m, and calculate r[i] and Y**i for i = 1...Kj, calculate through Y[logx] ignoring the r[]s, and then calculate r[i]
and Y[logx] * Yinv**[logx-i] for i=logx....Kj+1.

There are two different sets of relevant rules in the US - Post Office and
The PO's primary interest is making sure you don't mind if they don't
forward your mail once you stop using the Commercial Mail Receiving Agent
(CMRA) and secondarily that you aren't committing fraud by using the mailbox,
sending people change-of-address notices, ripping off your creditors, and
skipping town.  California has a hopelessly dishonest law that just went
into effect in 1995, which pretends to be designed to protect consumers from
fraud by the 7 million small businesses in CA that uses mailboxes,
and actually requires that _anybody_, business or not, who wants to rent
a mailbox must fill out the Post Office form and also appoint the PO or CMRA
as their agent for service of process and give them up-to-date True Addresses.
The PO, meanwhile, "usually wants" a California Driver's License plus another ID
to rent a box from them.  (I didn't have such a thing when I last rented a box,
and the PO hassled my mailbox company into asking for one when the new law
came out.)  After many attempts at calling the PO to get anybody
who knows the _official_ rules for what ID is required, I found a PO lawyer who told me the rules are in the "Domestic Mail Manual", which any
Postmaster has,
so my next step is to look up one of those before I next get a mailbox.
So maybe a random photo ID will work, such as your FooBar Consulting
Employee ID,
and maybe it won't, depending on what state you live in and how clueless
your local Post Office bureaucrats are.

I was going to refrain from ranting on this one (for once:-) but a couple points with cypherpunks relevance have come up.
One is that PACs are, in some sense, a donation-remailer.  The purpose is to get the money to its destination while
obfuscating the link between the donor and the candidate,
while allowing the PACs to take the political heat for it,
but giving them the out that "it's just being done on behalf of our fine upstanding donors."

the US I happen to believe in freedom of speech, especially political speech,

In this case, technology is giving us the ability to not only support
freedom of speech, but give it as little or as much visible linkage as desired,
allow the money to be passed around privately, and also to coordinate
publicity efforts of different groups in ways other than simply giving
cash to a candidate's bagman to be spent on publicity.  It's also
significantly changing the costs, speed, and targetability of speech,
allowing more people to get involved, and allowing low-cost efforts
to have more impact by reaching the right people.
And as far as "prevent the political process from being owned by the rich" goes, there have been brief exceptions over the last 5000 years in which
the less-rich have overthrown the rich, but campaign finance laws have almost
never kept the rich or the politicians from helping each other out.
enough to That's a given; not much point in giving someone a bribe if they don't know
what they're being bribed to do or who they're doing it for :-)
since at I also don't believe freedom of speech should be limited by national boundaries.
You can always agree not to vote for any candidate or party that doesn't

publicity supporting a candidate provided directly by non-candidates.

About 20 years ago, you could dial an FX line in Des Moines which
connected to a line at Offutt AFB in Nebraska and autorotored to a radio

two lights on on the PBX when nobody on the plane was talking on the phone;
the rapidly ensuing investigation found a guy in the barracks using a 16-button Autovon phone dialing through the system to call his buddies
in Guam.  As one might expect, the phone lines coming down from Looking Glass
are authorized to call anywhere in the world, at any precedence/preemption level they want to :-)  While I don't personally know either the radio

The Internet not only makes it easier for everybody to get their
15 minutes of fame, it guarantees that anything stupid you've said in public over the last 15 years will be available to the entire world.
So deal with it...  I'm more bothered by people indexing what I read.
What kinds of Cypherpunk technology can we use to affect this?
I don't think we need to do too much work on _increasing_ data collection;
the commercial markets will figure that one out fast enough,
though understanding technical possibilities enough to stay ahead is good.
Remailers and nymservers are obvious starts on the information-hiding end,
and even the basic non-encrypted cypherpunks remailers are good enough
for most applications.  The problem is getting them widely deployed.
I've seen a couple of web-page-based remailers, and they're probably
easy to deploy widely; they're not very secure without SSL, but they're
a start, and people on SSL-equipped systems can run them securely.
Anon web proxies are more work to deploy, but they're not mysterious,
and the main limits to deploying them are economics.
Nymservers, however, are still pretty new - technology like anon.penet.fi
is generally good enough for most people if you've got an operator you trust,
and an economic base that makes it worth running them.  But the more secure
nymservers are still complex, and probably not something the average hacker
can just pop up and run - we probably need to explore them more before
it'll be easy to do.
While I like getting services provided through community spirit, like most of the remailers, I suspect Tim's right that pay-per-use privacy services
are going to evolve, and probably dominate.  Among other things, they're in
the balance between the couch-potato on-line services and real Internet
connections; they're probably more likely to be offered by people who want
full-time connectivity, and will be used to offset the slightly higher costs
of real service.  However, partly due to patent issues, and partly just to
convenience, I don't think they all need to use fully-anonymous digicash
for every transaction; most of them can get by with service-provider tokens that may be paid for by digicash or by less-anonymous systems.
One of the main threats I see to privacy services is the Exon bill -
it's pretty obvious that most US service providers will have to limit
access to people over 18, in spite of any of the Good Senator's claims
If the Feds start making examples of people before any serious court cases
get decided (or after, if the good guys lose), that probably means that service providers will have to check ID to protect themselves.
There may be a market for services that validate that their customers
are over 18, but provide anonymity within that.

If you examine the grammar carefully, it's not a blatant lie,
it's quite correct.  If the government is going to "secure" (either
using the definition of "obtain for oneself" or "tie down")
Net communications, it will need to use some obnoxiously interfering technique, and so-called key-escrow is one way to do it.
Alternatively, using the definition of "secure" as "protect",
it will need to have access to private communications only through
security systems such as _real_ escrow, in which some mutually trusted
third party holds some assets until both parties have fulfilled the
terms of the escrow contract.  If you don't have a mutually trusted
third party, or one party doesn't deliver an asset it's supposed to,
or the other party doesn't play fair, then the transaction fails;
making sure it succeeds or fails cleanly, and verifying the status of the transaction at any time, is the escrow agent's job.
Government Access to Keys (GAK) is something radically different;
the government agrees not to interfere with your communications if
you deliver your keys to some other part of the government.  There's no trusted third party (unless you trust the government),
wiretap rules generally forbid verifying to the victim whether his
communications are tapped or not, and the deal with the non-independent
escrow agent allows the government to change the terms of the so-called
escrow at any time, unlike a real escrow agreement.  (In other words,
it's a lie, a total crock, and absolutely UnAmerican, and there isn't
even a House UnAmerican Activities Committee* to complain to :-)
[ * Translation for you non-Americans; the term "UnAmerican" means
"something the good honest people of this country disapprove of,
like Communism and Socialism and maybe Communism and even occasionally
Fascism in extreme cases and especially Communism (but certainly not
things like racism or militarism or corrupt lying politicians)"
The House UnAmerican Activities Committee was a committee of Congressmen
who went around investigating anybody they didn't like and suspected of
being Communist, or could accuse of being Communist if they didn't like them.
They were most active during the 1950s and 1960s, and are fortunately gone
by now.]

Escrow agents are supposed to deliver the correct keys successfully without
losing them (or storing them safely in the basement next to the cyclotron),

The US would allow export of software using the escrow keys for
Banque du Commerce et Credit Internationale - Paris, if the

Competent spies appear to be a surprisingly small fraction of
even government-employed espionage personnel, or maybe long-term
espionage is just inherently difficult the Soviet Empire,
Nazi Germany, and WWII Britain had all identified most of the spy
rings operating against them.  Philip Agee's article on how to
identify the CIA agents in a US embassy may have surprised the CIA,
but wouldn't have given any significant new information to the KGB.
(They might have been surprised he'd _say_ it...)
And amateurs and newcomers to the business aren't always that good.
Also, maybe a spy would be using GAKed crypto to avoid attracting
attention.  Much of espionage, especially emerging economic espionage,
primarily uses open-source information; there's nothing too secret
about sending the latest SAIC want-ads from EE Times back home,
but the CIA may learn what targets you're watching by watching
enough of your traffic to guess at your filtering criteria.

Obviously if the payer is the one transmitting the message, she doesn't

It doesn't lose any privacy, because she already knows an address to send

or some other public key he makes available to payers.
I had assumed that the payment information wasn't encrypted because that's a
separate problem from the basic digicash, and because if the payer wants
to keep the transaction private, she probably also needs to encrypt the
other side
of the transaction - e.g. the request for n widget at $d/widget.

By the time the Bad Guys can factor 2047-bit keys cheaply, you'll have

Also, there are a _lot_ of things around that tend to get 128-bit
MD5 calculations in them - don't get overoptimistic about anything
that pretends to be stronger than that.  (IDEA's 128-bit keys are
about as tough as 3000+bit RSA keys, and anything limited to 128 bits
is going to be in that general ballpark.)  PGP's random number stuff
_is_ stronger than that, but that's still a fundamental limit.
As a separate issue, programs do their calculations in data structures which
have _some_ sizes to them.  They could be assigned dynamically, but
large-and-static isn't that bad, and PGP was originally for DOS anyway;
if that's the least evil thing you find in the code, be happy :-)

Private Idaho's pretty easy - if you're replying to a message,
you'll need to do a cut&paste to move the original into PI,
but it follows all the standard Windows cut&paste clipboard stuff,
and after that you can send the message directly (from newer
versions of PI) or pick a menu item that hands it back to
your mailer (Eudora or several others are supported) for delivery.
Inside PI, you can pick menu items to call PGP, add remailer headers, etc.
I've got the ViaCrypt Windows package, as well as their DOS versions.
It's really nice for key management (which Private Idaho doesn't do
much of), though some of the other PGP Windows frontends also do that.
Its encryption/decryption/signing functions are mainly oriented towards files
rather than Clipboards - the big advantage of this is that there aren't any
silly 64KB or 640KB limits anywhere, but it's a bit clumsier.
I usually use Private Idaho as a front-end to ViaCrypt as well;
it's faster and prettier to have ViaCrypt handling the Windows interfaces
than to have PI pop up a DOS window to run Real PGP in.
The PGP 3.0 stuff, when it comes out, will help the process a lot.

No - it's too easy to attack.  (It's also outside the scope of what the
keyservers do - they're convenient ways to collect the data for the Web of Trust, but they're not trusted themselves.)
Even if you wanted "A majority vote of people who've signed a given key"
to revoke the key, that's easy to attack - you and your tentacles
can all sign the victim's key, send the signatures to the keyservers,
and now that you're the majority, you can all send in notes saying
"please revoke victim key - he's an FBI plant".
I'm not really satisfied with Matt's description of revocation
that requires it to be done by a key's signers, not owner,
though there are workarounds for most of the problems,
though I agree that PGP's framework is deficient
(not inadequate - it's still Pretty Good - but way underpowered.)
One problem is that usually _you_ are the one who knows your key
needs revoking (either you forgot the passphrase, or you know
the computer it was on has been compromised, or whatever.)
Under PolicyMaker, I guess the best way to implement this is to
always sign your own key (since signers are the ones who revoke keys),
and establish policies requiring unrevoked self-signatures.
It may be difficult to implement Certificate Revocation Lists
in a way that works well for your own keys, though, depending on
why you want to revoke them.

Grab the keys you want on the keyserver, cut+paste into Private Idaho,
decrypt (PGP won't find a message, but will find keys), and click on

Meanwhile, they've demonstrated that you can tie up a person for years,

Constitutional right to a speedy trial, and by not prosecuting they're
preserving the powers of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.
And while they've given PGP some extra publicity, they've also slowed
down the adoption of high-quality privacy tools for several years;
while they can't prevent hard-core privacy-addicts from getting it,
but they can make sure that it's not included in everybody's first
computer for a couple of years at least, until they get Clipper 2
or Exon 3 or Freeh-base Wire Taps or _something_ in place.
And they can always argue that "Well, the case against Phil didn't

crypto-narco-anarco-porno-terrorist Commie-sympathizing Nazi-protecting

Tom Johnston :
Thanks for your reply to Dr. Vulis's question.  I'd recommend examining this
policy somewhat critically, for a couple of reasons:
1) Development kits are useful, but if you've got an open, documented
interface, it's possible to develop code to use it without the kit.
(Ignoring, of course, the risk of smuggling. :-)
2) By "is treated as an export", do you mean by explicit government policy,
or by Microsoft?  Digital signatures and encrypted documents are perfectly
legal to export, as is authentication code to make digital signatures.
3) Consider the case of a contractor who buys the development kit,
and gives you code to sign.  You have no way to differentiate between
code that he developed himself, and code developed by some foreign
company that hired him and gave him the code (which is legal to import
into the US.)  He probably can't legally re-export the code, or export
the signed version of it, but he can export the signature itself,
since that's not cryptographic code, and the foreign company can
reattach it to their original document, which you have now signed....

To play Sternlight's Advocate for the moment, I'll have to disagree with you here.  40-bit encryption really is a joke, for any business data

64-bit RC4 encryption, while less than ideal, is still usable
for most applications; it's certainly stronger than DES by a couple
orders of magnitude, which is probably enough for now.
Yes, the Yanquis can wiretap you, but it's better than having
_everybody_ wiretap you.  (And besides, you're probably going to
use the 128-bit smuggled version anyway.)  This at least provides
a product you can use with _some_ credibility, assuming it

The French can still ban it, or require you to register your keys,

If you wanted a 64-bit crippled version, most applications need 64 bits
of IV anyway, so you could use 64 bits of salt for that, leaving 64 more.
To do a 40-bit version, you _could_ use 64 bits of salt and wire down the
other 24 bits into a well-known pattern instead of choosing them randomly.
That's three characters of ASCII, and I'd suggest "NSA" as the obvious

Are you looking for cellphones, or cordless phones?  There aren't a lot of
strongly encrypted cordless phones out there, but there may be some.
Digital spread spectrum is probably the best that's easy to find;
other kinds of "digital" phones usually pick a not-too-busy frequency
and transmit digitized voice, which is mildly secure against other people
using your base unit to make their phone calls, but doesn't protect your
privacy against anyone with digital-capable equipment.
The middle ground between cordless phones and cellphones includes
cordless phones with ranges of about a mile (AT&T and some other vendors
have sold them); they're typically in the $300-500 range, and use
spread spectrum to avoid interference to/from other phones.
It also includes phone services that can handle portable phones that
you have to stay in one place to use (i.e. once you start your phone call,
if you go out of range your call gets dropped rather than handed off to another cell.)  I'm not aware of commercial service like this in the US,
but there are wireless PBXs that work this way (which can be cheaper than
stringing phone wires around buildings.)
Cellphones, of course, can only (usefully) use encryption if the
cellular service provider uses it (i.e. if the end that's listening
to your radio transmission can decode it :-)  American cell-phone providers don't.  The GSM phones used in much of the world have encryption,
but it's apparently not very strong.
I'm not aware of any GAKed cordless phones, though I supposed there could be
US cellular phones don't need GAK because the government's strong-armed the
standards committees into using appallingly trivial crypto - none of this

I don't know that package, but most of them act as wrappers around
DOS PGP rather than filtering keystrokes or doing PGP internals.
There are several risks - getting your secret ring, getting your passphrase,
getting the RSA parameters without the passphrase itself.
Obviously, having your secret key ring file leak is not good,
but the fun parts _are_ IDEA-encrypted using your passphrases,
so it's not too much of a risk.  Having the passphrase or the
raw keys stolen would obviously be worse.
DOS/Windows is _not_ a secure operating system, if you believe
that there's more than one person in the universe.  (DOS doesn't
believe that, so in some sense it's perfectly secure. :-)
Nathaniel Borenstein's recent postings are a good reminder that
keystrokes can be stolen, easily, in that environment.

Without source code, if you're not a programmer, the things to look for are
circumstantial evidence - is the copy of the program you got off the server
PGP-signed by the purported author?  Or by any programmers you trust?
That doesn't tell you the program is trustable, but it does tell you if
it's a fake replacing the real thing.  Is the real thing trustable?
(Well, probably...)
There's also the problem of leaking your key back to the Bad Guys,

like playing with the system clock on timestamps.)

@_subject: Crypto suggestion - re: Fatal Flaws in Credit Cards 
Nathaniel's written about the "fatal flaw" in any system that
involves typing credit card numbers into your computer being that
they're easy for a keyboard-sniffer or similar cracker to recognize.
An obvious work-around for this (and for many of the problems with
Social Security / Taxpayer ID numbers) is to use some sort of smartcard
that generates one-shot numbers that the credit card company (or tax thugs)
can map back to the "real" owner's ID.  The downside of this approach
is that you need a lot of bits to support it, since you have to accomodate
the expected number of users * the average uses/user + overhead,
and that may (for credit cards) be annoyingly long to type in
(though fine for electrical-interface cards, or cards that display
their numbers as barcodes for a wand reader, or whatever.)
Some potential algorithms:
1) public-key - 512 bits isn't really enough (cracking it doesn't necessarily
        let you charge to everybody's Visa number, but it does let you
        figure out what everybody's is), and that's already too long.
2) data-base of randomly generated numbers - the would do ok for SSNs;
        give everybody a dozen or two, and let them get more if
        they want.  That wouldn't even require a smartcard, but it
        would tend to require a SSN card that you don't lose,
        since you probably won't remember the dozen long numbers on the back.
        This would of course require redesigning all those databases
        that know an SSN is 9 digits long - I view this as a Good Thing,
        especially since it may get people to stop using them as database keys.
        Is it practical for credit cards?  Ten billion customers times
        a million uses each is 16 digits; I suppose that's not much longer
        than current card numbers, though each card company would need to
        keep track of more numbers.  You'd probably cache a hundred or a
        in the card, and update the card every couple of years?
3) Some kind of hash or secret-key encryption of a constant (your "real"
card number)
        and a random number?  This would still be susceptible to brute-force
        search (10**20 not being an exceptionally large number), and you'd
        need an algorithm with either zero or a very low probability of
        collisions.  A secret-key version would require a tamper-proof card
        to reduce probability of theft, and I'm not sure I believe in
        tamper-proof cards, even if you have a lot of keys and a salt
        that tells the credit-card company which key to use.
Any other suggestions?

We have this discussion around here occasionally; one thing it does
is allows somebody to know that different messages were from the
_same_ person, whether that person is using a purported True Name
or an outright alias.  Another thing it does is allows you to demonstrate,
if need be, that you have the keys that were used to sign a message,
by signing another message with the same key, and optionally by
doing the Web Of Trust thing to validate your identity to someone.
I'm not aware that anyone's actually _done_ this in court,
but Utah and maybe other states have laws recognizing the validity of
digital signatures, and other courts could at least accept it along
with the usual Expert Witnesses.
Obviously it doesn't let you prove that an unsigned message isn't from you,

The parts of the Privacy Act that I remember are all restrictions on
_government_ actions, not private actions.  It's an important distinction;
even though TRW may know way too much about you, it's all information that
you voluntarily released to somebody, unlike data that the government requires you to give them.  And, yes, it's out-of-date and toothless.
If you're going to propose laws, you should not only think about
whether they'll do what you want, but also about what else they'll do,
how they'll be enforced, what are the side effects of that enforcement, etc.
How is the government going to ensure _non_existence of databases?
If I'm a prosecutor, and claim that you _might_ have personal data about
somebody on your machines beyond the Politically Correct Data Elements,
can I get a search warrant for _all_ your databases?  What about that
encrypted file on your PC at work?  Such things have been used to hold
personal data before (even by police like the LAPD or Stasi.)
No thanks.
If you want to require that a database exists, then a business can
demonstrate that they have it by producing it (though proving
whether or not in really includes all transactions is still difficult.)
On the other hand, if you don't make the law adequately enforceable,
you're encouraging violation and selective enforcement.
Yes!  GAKed encryption, to be sure - once there's a requirement that
you be able to produce your data for the government, they'll discover
that they need guaranteed access to data that would otherwise be guaranteed
inaccessible by strong encryption.
A much stronger way to increase privacy is to eliminate one of the most
popular unique keys used by these databases - the Social Security Number
which the government requires you to give almost anybody who gives you money.
Give each taxpayer a pile of taxid numbers (either cryptographically related,
or just randomly generated and stored in a big tax-department database)
so you can use a different taxid for everyone who needs one, making it
impossible for anybody but the government to correlate them.

Of course, in a market environment, you can do better than that.
Because there are almost always other people who want what you want,
and barring major government interference, there are ways to find them
and usually people interested in offering you and your fellow-travellers the service you want.  Most of the time, there are economies of scale
that make it cheaper to get the service together rather than each doing
it yourself, and you can decide whether to do it as a cooperative
or buy it from the vendor who's supporting the bunch of you.
ObCrypto: Even _with_ major government interference, there will be ways
to find your fellow-travellers.  Anonymously.

The flavor of optical amplifier and end equipment being deployed by one large telecomm company (ahem) over the next couple of years uses 8 colors, each at 2.4 Gbps (OC-48), giving about 20 Gbps,
which is about 10 times the current capacity (1.7 Gbps.)
(Some other telecomm companies are deploying 3-colors of OC-48.)
A nice thing about the optical amplifiers is that they have about triple
the range of the current regenerators, so one amplifier can replace about
16-24 regens,
reducing the amount of equipment that can fail and produce downtime.
Because of this increased capacity, it's a good time to upgrade to SONET rings
(which are dual rings that provide self-healing similar to FDDI's;
SONET self-repair typically takes 60 ms instead of the several minutes
to cross-connect the equivalent pile of T3s using current equipment.)

@_subject: Anonymous access to certificate revocation lists? 
[Hmmm - a crypto-related technical discussion that looks like it's coderpunks material?]
The article on Digital Signature Legislation by Brad Biddle Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, Ctr for Public Interest Law
had good coverage of the legal issues related to the Utah digital signature law,
but it touched on one interesting technical point - signature verification
systems that use Certificate Revocation Lists are vulnerable to traffic analysis
because you need to check the CRL at a CA every time you want to verify a
signature from a user certified by that CA.  (There's also denial-of-service
For example,  Alice wants to check the signature on Document D, which is signed by Bob, whose key is certified by Carol's CA.
Alice may have Bob's public key, or may need to fetch it from somewhere
(this is only a minor traffic analysis risk; she can get it from Bob
or from some public server, or even download all keys from the server.)
If the signature on Document D is good, Alice needs to verify Bob's key.
Alice can check Carol's signature on the key (perhaps fetching Carol's),
but she also needs to know if Bob's key is still good or if it's been revoked.
In a PGP environment, Bob is the only one who can revoke a key, and he's
responsible for shipping out revocations.  In a X.509 environment,
Carol the certifier can revoke her certification of Bob, so Alice has to
check with Carol to be sure she hasn't.  This creates a transaction record.
Biddle's article is concerned about the privacy implications of
Carol knowing about everybody who wants to verify Bob's key, because
the law doesn't address who she can sell the data to.
For cypherpunks, there are more concerns - it's tough to have a private conversation if you've got to exchange messages with
your friendly Government Post Office Certification Authority.
Is there a need to build anonymous CRL-checking proxies so people can
check X.509 signatures (e.g. the ones used by Netscape) anonymously?
How much caching can you do?  How would you decide how much to trust it?
The failure modes look different from anonymous remailers, where
a dishonest remailer can save your address, but you can protect yourself
by chaining remailers in serial.  With anonymous CRL proxies,
a dishonest proxy can tell you that "Bob"'s key isn't on Carol's CRL when it is;
to avoid this problem, you need to ask a bunch of proxies in parallel,
which means that any dishonest proxy can reveal your queries.
There's also the denial of service problem - depending on your policies,
and their implementation in software (especially packaged software),
what happens if you don't get a reply saying either yes or no on revocation -
what if Carol or a Man In The Middle decides not to respond to Alice's requests,
or to requests for certifications on Bob's key?  Are you hosed?

Hear, hear!  A decade or so ago, when I was a tool of the Military-Industrial

If you had data or (physical) keys or safe combinations you wanted to protect,
you could put them in the safes in the computer room or security office.  The
main thing we used the latter for was the combination of the computer-room safe,
which we kept in a sealed envelope for emergencies.  The same technique
can work just fine for crypto keys today.  If you'd rather use electronic
than sticking floppies in a safe, encrypt the password with Corporate Security's
public key, and email it to them with a Subject: line explaining what it is.
Retrieval is easy, and it's _not_ automatic; a human needs to be involved,
which is a Good Thing - this is _supposed_ to be an emergency backup.
If you don't trust it, split the key and email to two different Corporate
Security Management folks.  If you don't trust the users not to send bogus keys,
you shouldn't be trusting them with the information the keys protect.

Depending on the security environment you're running in, this can be
fine or can be dangerous; think about your threat models carefully.
For some applications, it makes a lot of sense.  It does give you
a traffic analysis problem - Eavesdroppers can tell that you sent the same
document to Alice, Bob, and Eve, but not Fred, in case this matters to you.
You could strengthen it a bit by superencrypting the copy you send to
the user with a very fast Snake-Oil algorithm, but Eve has the real document
(and the version encrypted with the good algorithm), so she's got known
plaintext for cracking messages sent to Alice and Bob if she wants.
In a DES world, you might do almost-triple-DES by encrypting with two common
keys up front and use DES with separate third keys for the final stage.
With RC4 or RC5, that doesn't gain you much, since the difference between
RC4/40 and RC4/256 is all in the key-scheduling phase, not the bulk part.
It doesn't really gain you anything; generating pseudo-random key bits
isn't much work compared to encrypting the files or public-key encrypting
the file keys to send to users, and there's no benefit other than getting some
extra entropy bits (which you may want to do anyway to stir into your
entropy pool in addition to using a random number source.)
What it does risk, in case this threat matters, is that somebody who can guess
the documents you might be encrypting can calculate their MD5s and trial
This lets them verify whether a given document is in the encrypted database,
for instance.
One of the NSA Rainbow Books discusses secure databases - maybe Purple or Gray?

Recursive-capable formats are clearly the way to go; the difficult problem is

a user-interface issue rather than a platform issue, though it also lets you
build limited-purpose tools instead of an all-singing, all-dancing camel

Unfortunately, the formats being considered give you too much known plaintext

*/MIME has MIME headers, PGP has the (expendable but present) ------BEGIN.
A new MIME header like
        X: parameters
where parameters are ignored would limit you to three bytes of known plaintext,
which is at least a start.
The prevailing philosophy is also that we need to build an API toolkit
so PGP components can be easily included into programs.  This means that
PGP will inherently no longer be able to decode all the PGP-based messages,
which may have different layers of other material wrapped around them.
PGP/MIME is probably one of the better excuses for doing so, as are
improved keyring-handling applications.

Back when the AT&T DSP-32 was new and hundred-CPU machines were exciting,

that you make hypercubes out of, or whatever.  A modern version of the same

It'd probably be pretty convenient for incoming, though you need to build
some mechanism for displaying the PGP output for signatures (since PGP
gives you the contents of the signed material when you check the sig.).
One interesting security problem is how to distinguish between the message
your PGP bot drops in your mailbox containing the message and an indication that
the signature is good from a message that someone carefully constructed
that _looks_ identical but includes its _own_ indication that the
(possibly bad) signature is good.
For outgoing mail, you'd either have to sign everything, which may be good,

I assume you mean the public key of the recipient?
That's equivalent to    stego(picture, ( RSA(sessionkey,pubkey), Symmetric(message, sessionkey)))
where Symmetric is a potentially cheaper (and weaker) algorithm than IDEA
that possibly uses transposition rather than strict block-structuring.
This approach is no more obscure than stego(stealth(PGP(message, pubkey)))
though slightly more obscure than stego(PGP(message, pubkey)), optionally
less secure,
and probably not much faster except for long messages with wimpy Symmetric.
And it still suffers from the non-stealthiness of vanilla RSA that Hal Finney, Adam Back, Harry Hastur, and others have discussed.
Might as well keep the stego and encryption parts separate.
You gain a certain degree of obscurity by using
   stego(picture, scramble( PGP(message, pubkey), key ))
where scramble is some cheap symmetric encryption algorithm and key is either the recipient's public key or keyid, and PGP is in binary mode.
This hides the message from eavesdroppers who don't know the recipient,
but not from eavesdroppers who are willing to test against the keys
of a list of usual suspects (assuming the recipient is one of them.)

That's not a cryptographic one-time-pad - the folks who strung the cable
across the Golden Gate used the little cable to haul a bigger hardware cable
across - you're taking your little cable and stretching it into a longer
thinner cable, tangling it up a bit, and hauling the ends across the narrows.
You haven't added anything to it, so it hasn't gotten any stronger,
and it may have gotten a lot weaker.
If the Small Pad has S bits of entropy, and the Large Pad has L>S bits,
the Large Pad still has s<=S bits of entropy in it, because you haven't
added any more from your hardware RNG - you've just shuffled around
the S bits of entropy you had and maybe even lost some if you're careless.
Therefore, the Large Pad is not a One Time Pad, because it's using each bit
of the Small Pad more than Once.  Maybe you only use the Large Pad once,
but it's no longer a One Time Pad; it's a small pad used more than once.
By your own admission, you're using your pads more than once.
A true One Time Pad has the property that each bit of pad has one bit of
so even if I know the value of N-1 bits of the pad, I know entirely nothing
about the value of the other bit, even with infinite computation.
With your method, if I know N-1 bits of the large pad, and have a large
enough computer, I can determine the other bit.  Depending on how strong
your algorithm for deriving the Large Pad from the Small Pad is,
I may or may not be able to afford the computation, and the computer
may or may not fit on one planet, but the bit is recoverable;
finding a fast way to crack it is just gravy.
Furthermore, there are two ways I can tell that you've only given the
Large Pad to the two official recipients and destroyed your originals.
One way is to totally observe your handling procedures all the time,
so I know what you've done with it.  This is obviously impractical.
The other way, a bit less secure, is for you to sign a contract as part of
your service that says what how you will generate and handle the keys,
who you'll give them to, what bonding and insurance you have, and how much
liability you'll accept for mishandling.  This isn't mathematically secure,
like a real one time pad, but it does establish a certain trust level -
I now know how much care you're using with the pads, how much I can sue you for
if you mess up, and therefore I can estimate the value of the information
I can trust your product to carry.  In general, that means I can trust it for
conversations which have a specific, limited monetary value, such as
purchase orders
for parts - I can sue you for the $N I'd lose if the message gets stolen.
But I'd better not trust it for high-value secrets, like my marketing strategy
or trade secrets or plans to invade Cuba, because if you mess up,
I can't recover enough money from you to cover my loss if they leak.

Remember that there's a major difference between "corporations"
and "business"; you seem to be mixing them up.  A corporation is
a legal fiction that treats a cooperative effort by one or more people
as if it were a person in itself, and normally involves limiting the
liability of the corporation's investors by putting it all on the
fictional person.  A business is what one or more people do to make money.
Most corporations are businesses, though not all.
Governments can legitimately tell corporations what to do because
that's part of the price of the legal fiction; a government can't
abuse a corporation because you can't beat up a legal fiction,
though it can say "Poof!  You're not a legal fiction any more",
and conversely, if the people who own the legal fiction don't like
what the government's telling it to do, they can dissolve it.
(Governments also enjoy regulating non-corporate businesses,
but they're no longer on solid moral ground.)
How are you going to _know_ that a "violation" occurred, if company A
tells company B your address or favorite liquor?  Only by having access
to the records of both companies.  Getting that through the courts,
for only the parts of their information relevant to you, is better than
blanket permission for the government to rummage through their files,
but after the first lawsuit lets investigators in, everything they've got
is clam bait anyway.  It's still major privacy violation - for the company

the MD5 hash used for key fingerprints is 128 bits long, and
cryptographically strong.
So birthday-problem collisions occur when you have ~ 2**64 keys around,

A 64-bit hash would be more interesting; you get collisions if you have
around 2**32 keys, which could actually happen.

:-)  The main problem is the limitations of hex; keyids like 0xdeadbeef
are available, but it's tough to really trigger Exonization that way.
Using 32 bits as ASCII instead is a bit more flexible.
Yeah - lots of people have been concerned about this.  Keyservers
simplify the problem a lot, since you no longer need to carry a large
number of keys around yourself, but the keyring handling mechanism of PGP
wasn't designed to scale.  Wouldn't be too hard to redesign, once PGP 3.0
comes out and we've got tools to do it - you could use a database or decently
structured ASCII file or files.  And DNS or similar distributed keyserver

There's a name collision on the word "hash" here.  Carl was using both

A hash table is a data structure that uses a mapping from an input string
to a number to decide where to put things.  An MD5 cryptographic hash
function used on PGP public keys (e.g. to get the fingerprint) is
64 bits long, so there may be a few collisions if there are 2**34 keys
out there; if things scale to that point, PGP 4.1.3 need to use SHA for
fingerprints instead (or in addition).  Carl is proposing using a hash table (indexed by a hash-table hash of the cryptographic hash)

The discussion has been about probability of collisions,
rather than usable exploits - they're still rare enough that
it's a birthday-problem issue.
While you're more likely to pick a specific prime with a
large gap before it than one with a small gap before it,
there are a lot more small gaps than large ones,
assuming that primes are roughly uniformly distributed
within any given range (which is roughly true) and
that therefore the gaps are geometrically distributed.
I worked an example for random 384-bit primes, which you'd
use to generate 768-bit RSA keys.  The density of primes
is approximately 1/ln384 = 1/266 = 1/meanlength. The unweighted quartile gap lengths are 77, 186, and 372.
The weighted quartiles for the gaps are 255, 447, and 720 ;
these correspond to unweighted cdfs of 61%, 81%, and 93%.
So, yes, it's a bit skewed (and enough that I'd rather not
work the birthday problem math, which is far easier with uniforms :-)
But it's probably not skewed enough to affect the number of primes required for a collision to occur by more than a factor
of 100 or so, and collisions in RSA keys require collisions in
both primes.

Web of trust is clearly the way to go, but it helps to have both.
1) You need Web of Trust anyway
2) You may have multiple signatures, by people other than the keyserver;
        issues like "Company X Authorizes Key NNN for purchase up to $D"
        are outside the scope of keyservers.
3) If the keyserver managers _want_ to sign the key, they can.
4) It's much more convenient to run a non-trusted keyserver;
        there's a lot less security paranoia required,
        and enough less work that more people will run them.
On the other hand, sending signed responses from the keyserver is clearly valuable.  The big MITM risk is for revoked keys;
the MITM may be able to block transmission of the revocation
notice or, for Certificate Revocation List models like X.509, the CRL,
and send an old key.  Having the MITM sign and timestamp the response
reduces the risk that an old self-revoked key will get through.

@_subject: key security for anon remailers 
We've been discussing the security problems with leaving your PGP key
around on anonymous remailers.  Mixmaster and the ghio2 remailers
have the key compiled in, but at least for ghio2 the string is sitting
there unencrypted and unmasked in the binary, where somebody who
can access the binary can run "strings" to steal it, without even the
bother of decompiling :-)  The primary alternative is to start up
the remailer with the PGP passphrase in its environment, but doing that
has its problems - the ghio2 remailer is made to run as a batch process
called for each message, rather than a permanent listener, and if
you did something like put the key into the sendmail daemon's environment,
it'd probably be even easier to steal (e.g. anybody on the machine
could do it by setting up their own mail-processor.)
A minor hack that I do with my remailer is to keep two versions
of the source - a vanilla one for distribution, and one with
all my customized information that I actually compile and run.
So how can you keep a persistent process that isn't part of the
mail empire?  One approach is to have a remailer daemon using sockets or
named pipes that does the decryption and feeds mail to a remailer
process (which _it_ calls) for delivery or has its own builtin remailing -
you'd input the key to the daemon when you start it up, and
wouldn't need to leave it in a file or environment, just in
the executing process itself.  Probably an hour's hack using PGP3.0,
or you can grind up the current I/O routines for PGP 2.6.2 and
ignore the fact that you void your RSAREF license that way.
You'd have to get rid of some of the code that overwrites the passphrase
and other sensitive data, though.
Another approach is to have a separate box that's not on the
network that the remailer runs on (obviously this is easier
on a machine you've got at home or work rather than at an ISP...)
You can take that old 8086 or 386, run a daemon to accept files
on the serial port and return them to the mail system on the serial port.
Uucp is probably secure enough.  (Does PGP run on Minix,
or on any of the old Xenix or Venix operating systems?

Since the entire remailer would be running on the box,
and you don't permit logins from the serial port,
it's probably pretty secure, even against someone with root

At 08:01 PM 3/5/96 -0500, "A. Padgett Peterson P.E. Information Security"
Oh, that would work fine.  Let a, b, and t be Alice, Bob, and Trent's secret DH
keys, and g and p be the generator and prime (all math below is mod p.)
If Bob wants to talk to Alice, he sends Trent B = g**b, marked "For Alice",
optionally anonymously.  Trent calculates X = B**t == g**bt, and sends it to
Alice calculates K = X**a == g**bat, calculates H = Hash(K) and posts it anonymously, or sends it to Trent to post or mail to Bob. If Alice wants to talk to Bob, she calculates A = g**a mod p,
sends it to Trent, optionally anonymously, marked "For Bob".
Trent calculates Y = A**t == g**at , and sends it to Bob.  Bob calculates K' = Y**b == g**abt, calculates H' = Hash(K') and
notices that it's the same as the H he pulled off the net earlier.
Bob says "Oh, wow!  Alice wants to talk to me!", encrypts some lame drivel of a message M with key K'==K, and mails it to Alice if he knows her address
or posts it with Subject: H', which Alice receives.
1) If Alice doesn't also want to talk to Bob, or Bob doesn't want to talk to
they don't both come up with H == H', so they only know that _some_
shy person wanted to talk to them but not who it is.
2) Why does Alice reply to the anonymous message?  Maybe just because
she's free that evening, or maybe because it included a note with it
that made her think the sender is a Nice Guy.
3) Under this method, Alice, Carol, Eve, and Greta can get together and notice
that they've all gotten mail with keys X; they don't know who X is, but
they know he's interested in all of them and he's probably a trolling loser :-)
So they all dump him.  However, even though they know Bob's public key B,
they don't know t, so they can't tell from g**bt mod p that it's Bob,
so they can't send him email saying "Get lost, loser" without revealing their
identity.  So Trent is providing anonymity, and needs to be trusted.
Without Trent, you could do a two-way version of the protocol - if Bob wants to
talk to Alice, he posts Hash(A**b), and vice versa, but Alice can go evaluate
Hash(B**a), Hash(C**a), Hash(D**a), etc., for everyone in the phone book,
and find out that it was Bob.
4) If Bob wants to reduce the level of trust he needs to have in Trent,
he can create a bunch of keys b1, b2, b3, ...., bk in addition to b,
and use a different one for each note.  If I remember correctly,
he can often calculate the inverse of b, b1,... (??????)
So he sends Trent B1=g**b1, Trent sends Alice X1=B1**t == g**b1t,
Alice calculates K1=X1**a == g**b1at, H1=Hash(g**b1at), and posts/sends.
Since she's also interested in Bob, she does the same with key a,
so Trent gives Bob K'g**bat.  Bob calculates Z = K'**binv == g**at(b*binv) mod p
== g**at, and then calculates Hash(Z**b1), Hash(Z**b2), Hash(Z**b3)...,
and notices that H1 = Hash(X**b1) and says "Oh, it's Alice!"
On the other hand, this doesn't appear to work if Alice is also using
multiple identities.
5) If Trent is a really trustable guy, he can offer meeting services
for people who have unusual tastes, such as liking (Exon) and Duct Tape
and Political Party Z and (for bipartite variants) suppliers and consumers
of various substances.  So he could broker a list of (Exon)fans,
as long as the activity is not criminal enough to lead to subpoenas or
warrants for his transactions (if he keeps them) or his key t
(or t1, t2, t3... if he's running multiple lists.)
Dimitris's approach of using
Hash(message) could be used to exchange preference here as well.
If Alice checks the message for Hash("Duct Tape"), she can decide
that she and the unknown sender would be a great match, and if she hadn't thought to check Hash((Exon)) she wouldn't
know that Bob enjoyed that also.  So it's at least some privacy for
low-popularity unusual activities :-)
6) Of course, Trent really could be a front for Blacknet :-)  Or Trent's key
could be stolen and published, embarassing all his customers.

Ah.  The method I described above doesn't solve your problem;
it just solves the original Shy-People's-Dating problem.
If your only concern is scalability, and you don't mind doing the
multiple-message handshaking Diffie-Hellman requires (<=SPD...),
you can use either a signed-keypart Diffie-Hellman or just use
PGP with the mailserver signing keys and keyserving.
PGP approach:  Bob has Public/private keys B/b, Alice A/a, Trent T/t, Sam S/s.
Trent is the mail agent at Alice's company, T is well-known.
Sam is the mail agent at Bob's company, S is well-known.
"Well-known" means that all the mail servers know each other's pubkeys.
If Alice and Bob both use the same postoffice, Sam==Trent, so it's simpler.
Bob to Sam:   Fetch Alice's Key
Sam to Trent: Fetch Alice's Key
Trent to Sam: A (signed by T)
Sam verifies  and caches A(signed by T), and already knows T.
Sam to Bob:   A (signed by T), T (signed by S).
Bob verifies  T's signature on A, S's on T. Bob to Sam:   To: Alice PGPEncrypted(Message,A)
Bob either caches A, or caches T, or doesn't bother.
Sam to Trent:   (ditto)
Trent to Alice: (ditto)
Alice decodes the message.  If she needs Bob's keys, she asks Sam to fetch them.
So there's basically a key-fetching handshake, with Trent and Sam acting as CAs as well as keyservers, and then regular PGP.
Clean, simple, and all your regular tools work, except of course
that the keyservers use some database to store keys in instead of
a big hulking PGP keyring.
A Diffie-Hellman relative is a bit messier, because it's Diffie-Hellman.
Assume that the modulus and generator p and g are agreed on (e.g. Photuris's.)
Alice and Bob have their PGP public keys A, B.
Trent and Sam have their PGP public keys T and S, well-known.
Bob generates a random x, calculates X = g**x mod p.
Bob to Sam:     To: alice X signed B.
Sam to Trent:   To: alice X signed B, B signed S.
Trent to Alice: To: alice, X signed B, B signed S, S signed T.
Alice generates random y, calculates Y = g**y mod p, also K = X**y mod p.
Alice to Trent: To: bob Y signed A
Trent to Sam:   To: bob Y signed A, A signed T
Sam to Bob:     To: bob, Y signed A, A signed T, T signed S
Bob verifies Y, A, T, calculates K' = Y**x mod p == K.
Bob to Sam:     To: alice Encrypted(Message,K).
Sam to Trent:   (ditto)
Trent to Alice: (ditto)
Alice decodes the message using K.  To make things simpler,
Bob might include Hash(K) or some other message identifier.
In this case, the key-fetching handshake is piggybacked along with the
DH key-exchange halves, and then Bob uses the jointly derived session key
to send a conventionally-encrypted message (which he _could_ use PGP for...)

Their complaint was that Internet time, at $2/hour, is 3.3 cents/minute,
far cheaper than the 22 cents/minute many of them are charging.
(The real price is, of course, double that, 6.6cents, because both ends of the
connection need Internet connections.)  I assume they're hoping that
the FCC won't know that the "hardware and software products" are
the sound cards that almost every new PC sells with and software
ranging from $50 down to free, and offers encryption which they don't,
as well as voice quality ranging from worse to much worse to better.  Some of the software works over the Internet, some chooses to get better
voice quality over direct modem connections (which use their services.)
They're also sleazing over the issue that many businesses are using
low-bit-rate voice on their private networks to squeeze more voice calls
into the networks they buy at bulk rates, most of which are billed
at rather less that 22 cents/minute.  If you're fitting four 16kbps calls
into the 64kbps standard voice circuit, and you're paying 12 cents/minute,
that's 3 cents/minute/call.
And _really_ big bulk-buying customers are paying a lot less than 22 cents -
I read in the papers that the Federal Telephone System is under 5 cents/minute.

P.S. Yes, I work for one of their competitors, though I'm not in the
voice business, and not speaking for my employer.  Aside from being
a concerned citizen, and a voice telephone service customer who
objects to companies that try to use the government to stomp their competitors
instead of competing against them freely, I'm also an Internet user.
Yes, the Internet is providing lots of new and exciting communications
possibilities, and if you're worried that people are going to use
the Internet for low-cost un-wiretappable encrypted phone calls that
sound worse than ham radio and allow folks in third-world countries
to better afford communications, go into the Internet business yourself.

The Quickcam videocameras are $100; they're the next toy to buy after
you've got the Soundblaster, CDRom, and 100MB Zip drive.  The Macintosh
folks will buy them first (:-), but pretty soon they'll be very common,
especially for business LAN users to have desktop video.
The problem is that, unlike GIFs, CU-SeeMe and other low-bit-rate video compression schemes are _very_ lossy.  You can't just put the stego bits
in the raw image before running the compression, because they'll get lost,
and if you try to fit them in to the compressed image, you've got to do it
very carefully or they'll really drastically affect the image.
I don't know CU-SeeMe's compression algorithm, but imagine putting bits
into a run-length-encoded file: if you put them in the run-length,
you'll change the lengths of the runs a lot.  If you put them in the color,
you'll get lots of streaks of random-looking noise.  Either way,
it's quite noticeable.  So you've got to work very carefully with the algorithm.
The other problem with CU-SeeMe is dropped frames, which someone mentioned.
That's easier; any email system, especially a stego type, has to deal
with lost message.  So try to fit your messages into single CUSM frames,
and build some tracking or ack messages or maybe message numbering,
so you can detect lossage and request retransmits.  It can be as complex
as X.25-over-stego-over-CU-SeeMe, or as simple as "Message 14 of 32, RSVP".
(If you _do_ implement X.25-over-stego-over-CU-SeeMe, you've got a fine
April 1 RFC :-)

Since most machines don't have a user named "bogususer", it'll bounce,

Maybe nobody is selling phone service, and the internet provider is
selling packet-transfer service, but phone service _is_ being provided.
One possible response would be for the FCC to require internet providers to
block phone connections (highly unlikely; you could offer the service
on any port you wanted, and I think one of the versions runs over IRC);
another would be for them to block the sale of the software (tough
to block sale of Israeli software, much less free software.)

Except for special multi-level secure operating systems, and maybe some
fancy capability-based systems, any operating system is going to let
some administrator poke around in memory and on the disk, and if there's
information anywhere on the machine, it can be gotten by the presevering
privileged person.  However, keeping the data off the disk is a very good
start, and RAM-grubbers are far tougher to run on good OSs than disk-grubbers.
Since the remailer has to decrypt data sent to it, it needs the password.
The alternative to keeping the data in RAM or on disk is to keep it on some
board or box hanging of a comm port or bus, such as a spare PC on RS232
running just a remailer application, or a decently self-protecting smart card
in a PCM-CIA slot.  To be really effective, it needs to be running the
remailer application as well as just crypto; otherwise it might be possible
to trick the card into decrypting arbitrary data for you or letting you
snoop the remailer.  On the other hand, if you're not that paranoid, and
just want to do crypto on a card anyway, Matt Blaze did some interesting
for fast decryption with a CPU assisting a slow smartcard; they're on         M. Blaze, "High-Bandwidth Encryption with Low-Bandwidth

Multi-hop messages are probably more important than cover traffic.
If the average message does two hops, then dive your estimates by two, etc.
In a real privacy environment, almost nobody would send serious messages
by just one remailer hop.  On the other hand, for posting minor spam
and non-professionally-secure messages to mailing lists, one hop will do.
A first step at estimating this would be to check the fraction of mail
addresses to known remailers (since most remailers are more likely to
track destinations than sources.)  Most of pamphlet's bouncemail is
from other remailers, but that seems to be more of a configuration issue,

There isn't a good answer to this, but it's probably a bad idea
for any US-based school or ISP that permits foreigners to

it to Yankees (e.g. though Unix group permissions.)
It's certainly a bad idea for any _small_ organization,

No - this one there _is_ a good answer to :-)  US Law doesn't
restrict use of encryption by foreigners located within its borders
(except maybe special circumstances like agents of foreign
governments; I'll pass on answering that) - only on whether
US persons can give them munitions, and of course patents.
The clean approach is for the foreigner to bring a copy of the
US version of PGP into the US, either on magnetic media
or by downloading from ftp.ox.ac.uk or other free-world site.
The foreigner isn't a US person, so he doesn't violate the
law by reading the code himself.  If the Uni or ISP knows
that it's providing encryption software to the foreigner,
it may be liable, but without scienter it's tough to have guilt.
Probably the foreigner should not keep encryption software on
University or ISP machines - floppy disks should do just fine :-)
Encryption material used only for authentication, of course,
is just fine, at least unless the foreigner is from a country
the US State Department considers to be an enemy, like Cuba.

DH key exchange is really only Exponentially Good Forward Secrecy,

the system is at best Good Enough Forward Secrecy.  The difference
between exponentially good and perfect is exponentially small,
which is fine if your keys are long enough.  On the other hand,
cracking a symmetric-key algorithm is generally the weak link,
unless you're using 112-bit or better secret keys, and even 112s
might be crackable during the lifetime of the current universe.
How much information leaks if you reveal (say) 128 bits of a 1024-bit Diffie-Hellman key?  Does it tell you anything at all
about any of the remaining 896 bits?  Is it safe to use 8 slices
of the 1024-bit key if 7 are revealed?   Does RSA have the same
problem?  This is partly an efficiency hack (cutting the number

How much of a problem it is depends on the application you're using PGP for,
but yes, it's a concern.  There's a program called "stealth" by "Harry Hastur"
which lets you remove or hide this information, as well as hiding most of
the PGP headers.  (There are some aspects of PGP file structure that are
difficult to hide, at least without doing almost as much work as PGP
was already doing, and I don't know if it adjusts for the mathematical
properties of RSA-encrypted data which make it possible to identify the
public key over some number of messages.)
When the new PGP 3.0 comes out, there will be some support for
shorter keyIDs (which isn't perfect, but for instance a 4-bit keyID
would let you not try to decrypt 15/16ths of the messages,
while not really fingering you as the recipient.)
Also, if you have someone you frequently correspond with on some topic
(perhaps a mailing list) and want to be able to send them messages that
don't identify them, have them generate a public key they use just for that application.  You can send your request by anonymous remailer,
and they can send you a reply by anonymous remailer or post to
alt.anonymous.messages.  This still permits traffic analysis (nobody knows who keyid 0x12345678 is, but they know you sent him
ten messages in the last month.)

There are different places you can do your wiretap, depending on
convenience, weather, observability, whether you've got a warrant, etc.
ESSs don't really change the pair of wire coming from your house
out to the telephone pole, over to your local wire center, and
into the distribution system that eventually connects them to the switch.
You've still got a pair of copper wires.  On the other hand,
underground wiring is harder to get at, and pair gain systems such as
Subscriber Loop Carrier bring some of the multiplexing out to your block
instead of all the way back to the phone office, and ESSs do make those
more cost-effective.  Connections from PBXs are also harder to tap than
individual phone lines, since your phone call may be on any of the (probably
virtual) circuits going from the PBX to the phone office.
I don't think they blew it there, although the EFF's work against S.266 a few
years back really hurt them.  There are two ways to get oppressive laws
enacted -
wholesale, or bit by bit.  A wholesale ban would have affected a lot of people,
and had substantial constitutional difficulties.  On the other hand,
a mere regulation telling the already regulated telephone companies that they
have to do a bit more free work in return for their monopoly status
isn't a big constitutional stretch, and mainly annoys phone companies
rather than end consumers.  Also, it's far easier to enforce regulations on
phone companies - there are bureaucrats in place to do it, you can kick them
in all sorts of ways if they don't cooperate, and it gets you most of your
wiretapping and enforcement done wholesale rather than retail.

Caffeine, my personal favorite, is 5000-10000, though it's much harder

A system with a network connection _can_ be C2 or higher rated - *if* it can adequately verify that it knows who its users are.  That's hard,
but it's doable, if it restricts access to a limited set of users,
and has enforcement mechanisms to support it.  For instance, connection
over an encrypted, crypto-authenticated LAN which can enforce session
ownership or trustably label all data packets could work; you'd typically
do that with some kind of wrapper over IP or TCP and a bullet-proofed OS
It's far cleaner if you can do networking in user space rather than the kernel;
I think the UUCP-equipped configurations for AT&T's B1-rated System V/MLS
were part of the rated configuration, though it's been a while since I've
been near that world.  It's also easier if you limit each system (or at

Hey, wait, are Jim Bell and I supposed to be in fairly complete agreement
on something?  :-)
It probably would make it much easier for Designated Scary People to use crypto without having to take special precautions.  If IPv6 security
was part of the standard Microsoft Win2000 networking stack (ok, without major
botches, and with a convenient user interface :-), and PGPphone came on
the Soundblaster N+1 installation disk, all those tax-evaders and pharmaceutical
wholesalers and, and, and father-rapers could talk to their accountants in
and chat with each other about tax-evadin' and father-rapin' and _crime_,
and it'd be much harder to Federalize their money and arrest their clients.
And a lot of that probably won't happen if Microsoft and Soundblaster have to
make domestic and international versions of their software.
Well, certainly not the position of MNCs who are big players in the
military-industrial complex.  But what's this _our_ terminology?
In particular, cryptography offers the only technical defense against the
ability of computers to centralize and correlate information from many sources,
which is one of the primary threats to personal privacy today,
and MNCs are generally supportive of centralizing any information they can.
Well, I'd expect not.  It wasn't exactly an unbiased crowd; there were a couple people there on Our Side, but it was largely people who agreed
with Dr. Denning on the political objectives, and the business contingent
included companies like TIS which _sell_ so-called escrow software.
Which side is Dr. Denning _on_ here?  At present, software using CAPIs
is not exportable under the ITAR, since the CAPI is a "component of a munitions system"; is she now advocating legalized export of software
using government-approved CAPIs only?  She seems to have been the big public advocate of it for years....
Sure - the fact that Microsoft Office built-in file protection
isn't even up to RC4/40 standards isn't primarily the fault of export controls,
but the lack of a clearly defined official export standard doesn't _help_ them
make a business case for including good encryption.
She certainly hasn't helped, and she's aided and abetted and provided
assistance to the folks like Freeh who want to stop free speech and privacy,
but it's also emotional because many of us really don't want our privacy
compromised and our freedom of speech restricted.  The Bill of Rights
isn't perfect, but it's far better than what the government is using today,
and it's got provisions like the 9th and 10th amendments to remind readers
that it's just a set of examples of civil rights, not an exhaustive inventory.
I've always enjoyed discussing issues with people who offer an
outrageously extreme set of proposals, then back off to a still offensive
level and call it "balanced".  The status quo already gives too much effective power to the government, and she's proposing to give in
where it the alternatives are unenforceable and strenghten her position
where there's new power to be seized.

I'm not currently a candidate, though I've had the pleasure of running

on some of the issues.
if required.
Hmmm - that'll be a bit tough on line.  Got any spare anti-electrons?
I could run it through rot-13 :-)
The Bill of Rights was a good start, but courts have seriously mishandled it
over the past 200 years, whether to support the public mood on an upcoming
war (as in the Schenk (sp?) case, which gave us the appallingly misused
"fire in a public theater" dictum), or to permit censorship of speech that
offends the popular morals, or to support oligopolies through restricting
access to radio and TV broadcasting to government-approved companies.
I tend to agree with Hugo Black's position that the people who wrote
"Congress shall make no law...." meant what they said.
In particular, even supposing, as Holmes did, that there are types of
speech so offensive and valueless as to not be protected by the First Amendment,
the Constitution also doesn't specifically empower them to ban it either.
Yes - there's a lot of old law and FCC regulation that needs to be repealed,
and that takes new laws.
First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, Tenth
No - nor of other technology, either.
Not only do _I_ favor it, the Supreme Court also supports it.
Electronic materials as well.
Yes and No.  Governments have a role to play in providing access to
existing government-run systems that have public information.
No.  Government-provided services are government-controlled services.
And governments can't guarantee services - they can only force people to buy them (with their own recycled money) from pro-government providers, while interfering with competing technologies and services that the
market would otherwise provide.  From a Liberal perspective, Internet
access is already available on the open market for less than the cost
of cable TV, in most of the country - trading government control of the
most important media of the next two decades for the cost of a half-pack
of cigarettes a day per citizen would be a really bad choice.
Not strictly - the public does own most of the government's information,
but providing subsidized access to it isn't an appropriate use of tax money.
Providing at-cost access certainly is, for information that the government
should be giving out, and restricting distribution of that information
or giving monopoly access to rent-seeking private companies certainly is wrong.
But there's a lot of information the government has today that it shouldn't -
people's private data that they've been forced to provide to bureaucrats,
or information that wasn't quite as forced such as census data.  Most of that data should be destroyed.  And there are difficult questions,
such as how to reveal details on CIA/NSA/FBI abuses without violating
the privacy of people they spied on or interefered with.
Of course not.  (I do distinguish between banning fraud and embezzlement,
which is arguably a reasonable government function, and regulating the communications often used in those activities.)
Sure - cops need phones, too.   And access to the communications
of other government officials to investigate crime and corruption
in government is mostly safe.  But demanding access to citizens' private communications is not only _far_ outside the bounds of government's
legitimate access and a bare-faced grab for political power
by the folks who brought us COINTELPRO and J Edgar Hoover's files,
but is a call to violate individuals' rights to use whatever tools
they want to protect their privacy to support their power-grab.
And they've been so _disingenuous_ about it...
No - I favor legislation to eliminate the half-way measure we have,
the single "Social Security" tax-id Number, and, until we eliminate
privacy-invasive taxes altogether, give taxpayers a large group of
numbers so they don't have to give everybody a universal identifier
just to pay their taxes.

@_subject: Re: NT's C2 rating 
Leaving out Red Book details (since back when I last read the Red Book,
nobody really had any general solutions to the problems), the problem is that
the Orange Book demands that for C-level and above, the operating system
must know the identity of all the users so it can track file, process,
and authentication accesses, and for B1 and up, it also needs to know
what users are allowed to use what security levels and what levels they're
actually operating at.
1) It's difficult to do that - you have to trust the messages coming over
a wire from the other machine to tell you who they're from, unless you can
be sure there's only one user per wire.  That means you need a mechanism
for trusting the other machine, a mechanism for communicating that trust,
a shared or mappable mechanism for identifying users, etc.
That takes a certain amount of work even when you control all the machines
that your machine can talk to, which you often can't (e.g. on an outer
2) To _certify_ a system for general use (as opposed to certifying a specific
instantiation of a system), you need to be sure that it will be installed
and maintained in a way that will provide that identification and assurance.
That's even harder, because you either need cryptographic authentication
and session control, or else you need a way to guarantee that the system
you're certifying only talk to machines that are administered in coordination
with it, in spite of being installed by some Army grunt or military contractor
who may RTFM but isn't a security wizard.  And in the C2-certification biz,
"cryptographic" means "something you got from the NSA", because they're the
ones who do military crypto, and they tend not to trust software.
Fortezza cards may do this stuff ok....
3) The networking code becomes part of the Trusted Comptuting Base,
which means you have to be able to verify that it can't mess with anything
that you don't want it messing with, and if it supports more than one
simultaneous user, it's got to be able to keep track of sessions and
communicate them reliably to the OS and TCB.  That works relatively well
for serial-port user logins and maybe uucp.  TCP/IP, on the other hand, is typically implemented down in the guts of the OS,
partly because IP needs to talk to hardware a lot, partly because it's
often easier to do the TCP and IP together, partly for "speed", and partly
because it's much more efficient to hand stuff to multiple users from kernel
space than to hand it up to a user-space application which then IPCs things
back through the kernel to their destination user processes.
It also tends to have various pieces running as root, either to access
hardware or protected parts of the software, or to make it easier
to transfer ownership of information to processes owned by different users.
(Yes, this is a Unix-centric view, but other systems tend to do similar stuff.)
This makes it difficult to verify that it's clean (hey, parts of it are
tough enough to get working really well, much less bug-free), and
it's even tougher at higher levels like B2 that want Least Privilege
rather than having a SuperUser root that can do everything.
Root stuff is just basically dangerous anyway.  And B1-level OSs often run
the TCB (including root) at System Low to make sure no regular user can mess with it, which makes it hard for root-owned processes to write up to users.

@_subject: Re: (X:x)e$ 's other use 
Hi, Gary - actually this comes up every 3-6 months.  There are
some fundamental problems with the using e$ as a new currency.
E$ is a fine medium for exchanging certificates of whatever it is you're
trying to certify, just as paper with pictures of dead politicians is.
Printing paper is easy, and it's easy to add lots of zeros when you do.
Printing 1s and 0s is also easy, and there are plenty of zeros out there.
Digging shiny malleable ductile yellow metal out of the ground is harder.
The tough part, with all these media, is getting somebody to give you
real stuff in return for a certificate that claims to be worth 1000.
The three basic ways certificate-issuers have done this are
1) Guarantee that they'll give you stuff or services in return
2) Convince a lot of people to exchange stuff or services for them,
        so you can usually redeem them without going to the bank
3) Threaten to beat people up if they don't accept them.
Method 1 works if people trust you and you've got stuff to sell.
Subway tokens and postage stamps have been used as money because
most people want to ride subways and mail letters, and the
subway and mail-carrying companies were big enough that you'd
expect to be able to redeem them before the companies went out of business
(or you moved out of town), so you can spend some money safely.
Note that this method works both for stuff you have on hand,
like shiny metal, or for services you're promising to do later
and will have to get resources for.
Banknotes work because well-behaved banks only issue enough
promises to deliver shiny metal to cover the amount of metal they have;
if they start making more promises than they can deliver on,
the market gets annoyed at them and people stop accepting their paper
in return for goods and services, and stop giving them shiny metal
in return for convenient paper, and Method 2 fails for them.
But if banks keep their promises, people trust them, and they make money.
This works both in free markets and in government-controlled markets.
As long as the banks are _honest_ about their policies for issuing notes,
it doesn't matter if they're doing fractional reserve or printing
the stuff outright; you can decide how much to trust them,
or whether to do all your transactions with shiny metal.
Method 3 you'll recognize.  There'd be nothing wrong with the Federal Reserve if they only used methods 1 and 2; individual consumers can
decide whether to trust them not to print a lot more zeros than they should.
And they don't have a monopoly on currency - there are some kinds of
taxes that apply to some private currencies, but you can go into the
average bank today, ask them to write a cashier's check to someone
(and probably still to "bearer"), pay them, and they'll be happy to do it
for only a small commission, and American Express will do it as well.
And people will take their paper, though in the case of traveller's checks
it's sometimes a hassle to accept on an occasional basis.
On line, of course, it's tough to use metal as a way to pay people,
so technologies like e$ are necessary.  #			Thanks;  Bill

Yes, it's the patents.  Chaum owns them, and he's not Easy To Do Business With.
On the other hand, a couple of banks _have_ recently started doing business
with him - Mark Twain Bank in St. Louis, and Merita Bank in Finland - check the
cypherpunks archives ( / nntp.hks.net) for details.  There were a
couple of earlier attempts, in which one group discovered that there are an
appalling number of banking laws which make it hard to get a real bank started,
and another group discovered that it's much easier to be a Credit Union than
a Bank under US banking law, but it's still hard to get a business model
that's likely to make non-negative amounts of money that way.
The reason you can't just rip them off (unlike, say, PGP's early relationships
with RSADSI/PKP) is that electronic commerce can only work well if it's
legitimate -
if you want real businesses to deal with you, and real banks to handle money for you, they need to be assured that they won't lose their assets in a
patent lawsuit.
On the other hand, Doug Barnes posted some interesting articles on
"agnostic banking", a variant on Chaum's digicash where the bank
can run simpler digital cash protocols that don't violate Chaum's patent,
but the bank can't tell whether the customer is using Chaum's blinded signatures
or not, so the customer can rip off Chaum's intellectual property without
the bank having to be knowledgeable or involved (nudge, nudge, wink, wink.)
On a non-financial level, Chaum didn't complain about the Magic Money / Tacky Tokens demos that some of the cypherpunks did, and Digicash came out with
a play-money version that some of us used before the commercial deal was done.
Yeah, yeah, many of us can rant against patents as well.  Been there, done that,
even invented stuff and found somebody else had previously invented and
patented it.
The League for Programming Freedom has some high-quality detailed patent rants,
and if you give RMS a grant for airfare he'd probably be happy to go picket
Chaum's company for you :-)
As far as Chaum hoarding the patents, he's always been willing to deal,
but since he's mostly an academic rather than a businessman, he's set a very
high up-front price so little guys don't bother him, only mega-banks that will
come now that he built it.  I'd guess the prices the banks he's now dealing
with paid
are rather lower than that, but it's a start for getting real business to

[a bunch of mostly correct things, except for]
Well, after dealing with the full faith and credit of the issuing bank,
you may acquire some pieces of paper which are backed by the dubious
faith, credit, and reputation of some government.  As you later say,
I've used coffee-based currency, backed by my co-worker Joe.
Worked fine, and excess profits usually got turned into bagels and donuts.
Most of my money is usually in banks, where it exists as bits in a ledger
rather than as government-backed paper; my credit union at least has
private insurance in addition to the government insurance, so there's
someone honest backing the bank, even though it's only denominated in fiats.
Digicash of various sorts may be able to get some political support if
some bank wants to issue accounts denominated in ECUs, though ultimately
the issue isn't whether it's backed by governments, gold, or insurance agents,
but whether someone's willing to give you stuff for it when you want stuff.
If you're buying physical stuff, you're probably buying from someone nearby,
so it's usually useful to be able to _pay_ in local-flavored currency.
In Europe, "local" may include the currencies of several nearby countries;
in the US lower-48, that usually means US dollars, since Canadians will

Unfortunately, the method can be cracked easily.  Because the system
uses two patented states, a Normal Quantum State and an Emergency Quantum State,
and it's patent-pending in 26 different countries, you can divide the
26 patent-pending states by the two patented states giving a pending 13.
By rotating the 13 twice, of course, the original text can be recovered.
However, the method is partially useful, using a lemma by Dr. Denning.
While 26 is divisible by 2, it's not divisible by 3, so the addition of
a third state renders it effective again.  Denning's paper recommends
use of a National Security State as the additional state, which provides
effective protection, additional security and supports the legitimate needs
of law enforcement.  So if you want your crypto to be secure, it's an offer you can't refuse...
Another approach has been suggested by the Syndicate for Quantum Deconstruction,
in their prescient 1998 paper "Smash the State".  By deconstructing the quantum packet on arrival, an imbalance is created which can only be resolved
by constructing the packet an equal time period before the origination
of the packet in the Normal Quantum State.  In addition to preventing the
emergence of the Emergency Quantum State, it allows, and in fact requires,
the packet to be present and read some time before its original transmission
Copies of the paper are currently circulating only as preprints; the
original will be posted on

Out of curiousity, why use crypt() instead of, say, MD5, which is

And just as crypt() lets you distinguish between input and output
based on length and character set, if you use MD5, you know the
output is 128 bits, rendered either as raw bits or 32 hexes
depending on your program environment.
With crypt(), for users who don't remember their passwords, you can
run crack to try and recover them.  This doesn't work, of course,
if your stored "encrypted password" is really an unencrypted
non-13-byte string which wouldn't ever be the output of crypt().
MD5, on the other hand, allows enough passphrase space that a brute force

My work PGP address is available on my company's internal phone-book web,

Sure - the standard ASCII form that PGP extracts keys in is parseable by PGP.
(You have to be careful, when obtaining keys by mail/finger/html, that if you
get multiple keys, you do something appropriate, like split them up first.)
Unfortunately, Real PGP likes to ask you interactively if you want to add
the keys it found to a keyring, or whatever, but you could just feed it
some "Y"s on stdin to keep it happy.  The new PGP 3.0 stuff will have libraries

@_author: assuming it's faster than the hash 
@_subject: Re: Spinners and compression functions 
Obviously you need to mix raw data with a hash function if you really
want to smear out the entropy so there's an even amount per output byte.
But lossless compression can gain you a little bit, and seldom hurts
(assuming it's faster than the hash), and it can help you be less unrealistic about the amount of entropy you've really got.
Data contains varying quantities of predictablity and unpredictability.
Some of the predictability has simple enough structure that a basic
compression function can find and exploit it to squash the data.
Some of the predictability doesn't.  For what it's worth, compressing
the data before using it for other things does leave you with somewhat
more consistent entropy per byte for "typical" random input, because it
eliminates the easy stuff.  Obviously there are cases where this doesn't
help you much, like inputting a graphic representation of a column of
Chinese characters, where you'd benefit a lot more by looking them up
and outputting Unicode or some such and then compressing (and where the first time you encounter a given character, the output of the compression
function has to represent the picture, where the next time it sees the
same set of input bits, it's able to abbreviate much more.)

Be careful writing code - sometimes a byte is -128 to 127 instead of 0 to 255.
Also, there are machines (mostly old kinky ones) that use bytes of sizes

8 bits.
Not always; bytes may have extra baggage with them such as start&stop bits
(when you're transmitting async), or parity bits.  DES uses 56 bit keys,
but they're really 8 bytes with the high bit of each byte ignored.
But, yeah, 5 bytes is normally 40 bits.
What's bothering you about it?  The fact that it's not a multiple of 4?
(No problem, think of it as a character string.)  The fact that it's way too
to protect any real information, and you've always been taught to use passwords
longer than that, even for computer accounts without real money in them? Well, yeah, it is - so what?  A 40-bit key would take few days to crack with
general-purpose 486 or Pentium PCs, though a gate-array would make it easy
to use the right kinds of logic operations to crack it much faster.  Are you puzzled that the government doesn't care about your ability to
protect your money or your information?  Think if it from their perspective -
if special equipment makes it cost 8 cents to crack a key, they'd probably
have to only crack semi-interesting-looking messages, as opposed to hoovering down anything they could find, and wouldn't that be a shame for

One issue with the "We could require that everybody label their packets"

Another problem is that adequate labelling requires public-key cryptography,

standards for domestic use and export, and means you can't mass-market
exportable rating software.  We EEEVILLL Net Users would certainly

mean you can use it for non-authentication encryption as well as signatures
There's also the problem that both are patented, though the patents behind
DSS are weak and run out in a year or two.)
Another problem is that this proposal would require multiple authentication
headers per IP packet - not only is it wasteful, but is it even supported?

ObExon:  Does the Administration propose to label any on-line copies of the Federal Register?  There's often material in there, such as the recent

Personally, I find the idea that the government could hope to track the economy
so closely as to notice a $10M/year addition to the money supply to
be disturbing (though it was done in a science fiction story about
20 years ago :-)  With digital cash, it's also unrealistic - we
finally have a technology for moving money around _without_
them being able to track it all, if we want to deploy it.
In Chaum's DigiCash, the payer makes up the serial number, blinds it,
and has the bank sign it blind, so the bank never knows the number
until the payee deposits it.  So this doesn't work.
(The payee knows the number when he receives it from the payer,
but in online operation he deposits it right away.)
(There are alternative ways to structure transactions so the payee
issues the serial number, or even so the bank does, but they're not needed.)
What the bank _does_ know is whether the total number of digibucks with
its signature on them that it's received is larger than the number it's signed -
so if their private signature key has been stolen by counterfeiters,
they'll know for sure once the counterfeiting level exceeds the amount of
float of outstanding digibucks they've issued; they may suspect it earlier
if the redemption level is high enough that the float statistics look real
On the other hand, with Chaum's system, what role would the US government
have in issuing digibucks, rather than banks doing it?  The one-big-bank
approach doesn't scale well, though I suppose the Feds could pay member banks
with digibucks instead of paperbucks or journal entries if they wanted to,
and FedBucks might be more spendable in some markets than VisaBucks or
or MeritaKroner or HKL$ or YakuzaYen or Chemical$ or CocaRubles.
In a  multiple-bank scenario, that works fine.  With a government-issued
legal-tender digital currency, it's an offer you can't refuse...
Holding digital cash for a long time isn't difficult - it's easier than
holding paper cash for a long time, since you can keep multiple encrypted
copies (so stealing them isn't very useful to the thief and isn't as
damaging to the victim), and you can stash floppies in smaller, less armored
safe deposit boxes than you'd need for large quantities of cash.
Of course, if you happen to become dead while you're storing it,
the paper cash is far more useful to your heirs, so I assume we'll have
a government-sponsored cash-escrow system announced soon to protect
the government's interest in collection of inheritance taxes...

@_subject: Re: Protocols at the Point of a Gun 
There are serious technical problems with the suggestion that labelling packets
as "Adult" or "Child" using IP options and filtering at ISPs for censorship.
IP works on a per-machine basis (technically, a per-network-interface basis,
though for most client machines that's the same thing.)  That means that a web or nntp server including some "Adult" material and some "Child" material
either needs
a way for an application process to communicate this to the network drivers,
or needs to label all packets as "Adult" to avoid the politically incorrect risk
of mislabelling a packet as "Child" when it's not.  The standard TCP/IP API programming interface software on Windows, Mac, and Unix machines doesn't
provide for applications to _tell_ the network drivers about IP options, so even if
IPng had censorship features added, the applications couldn't use it.
(There are a few military multi-level security versions of Unix that give
you more flexibility for this sort of thing, but they tend to provide
mandatory security so you _can't_ send a packet marked "UNCLASSIFIED" from a
"TOP SECRET" session.)  Another problem is that it only addresses single-user client machines,
rather than multi-user operating systems such as Linux, which has a million
or so
users out there.  The model works fine when you treat a PC as a fancy version of
a dumb terminal, but a machine shared by multiple users (whether many at one
or one at a time) uses a single connection to support all of them - that
means you
can't have censored material available to the child and uncensored material
available to the parent unless the networking software can pass the censorship
labels on to the application program - but again, the standard operating system
interfaces (developed over many years by thousands of The Free World's finest
developers :-) don't have a way to implement it, because it was never a
design goal.
Trying to implement censored sessions at a transport level instead has its
own problems.
First of all, TCP provides reliable sessions; censoring packets based on IP
in the middle of a transaction means that TCP will retransmit until the
packet gets
through or it gives up and drops the connection, so any "Adult" packets would
dump a Registered Child out of the browser, even if they were unintentional
(e.g. from an Adult who labels all packets "Adult" to avoid being liable for
or packets from Europe that were default-labelled by a service provider to avoid
having to read them all, or from the Library of Congress Online Edition if
the Librarian
labels each packet correctly.)  On the other hand, UDP packet exchange,
which doesn't
use sessions, would require validating the user's ID and authorization on
each packet.
Furthermore, if the censorship information is carried at the transport level,
or at a higher level (i.e. headers in the message itself), the only way the
ISP's routers, which work at the IP level, can censor packets is to perform the
equivalent of the Post Office steaming open envelopes before delivering them
to your house, and refusing to deliver them if there's a child living in the
and the letter either contains a bad word or is written in a language the
Post Office doesn't understand, such as Finnish or Japanese or PGP.
If you create outgoing packets that are labelled "Minor", and contain
"Restricted to Government-Certified Adults Only, and No Felons or
Foreigners Allowed" material, you can get busted for it.
So you have to either restrict all your outgoing packets to be labelled "RtG-C Adults O,aNFoFA", or else make sure all the material you transmit
passes the "Government-Approved-for-Minors, Foreigners, and Victorian
ladies" filter.
On the other hand, if you don't log in to your ISP with a
"government-certified adult,
non-felon, non-foreigner, politically stable, not-a-Commie-or-Jew" id,
it'll block any packets not approved for you.  Any news or web server will also
have refuse to send any "Adult"-labelled material to you if the requests
arrived on a "Kid"-labelled connection - this means that either the server
will have to only carry Kid-approved traffic, or only talk to Adults,
or add an "Adult" label to all outgoing packets whether marked "Kid" or not,
or else it will have to break protocol boundaries by passing IP-layer
up to the application.

No, you can't.  One problem is that the Selective Availability coding
isn't predictable, since it uses some kind of secret military code -
so you don't know what its values are until you hear them.
So as long as you share any satellites with the recipient, you need
to be sure to output the correct codes for that satellite,
which means you need to either be in range or have access to some
internet "position remailer" site that's making them available.
As far as predicting relative timing between satellites to fake your
position, if that's sufficiently unpredictable that you can't fake it,
as Denning and MacDoran say, then it should also be equally unpredictable
to the verifier who wants to know if you're telling the truth or faking it.
And if you require systems to respond to requests for "Where are you now?"
or especially "Where were you on the night of April 13th at 8:37pm?",
the spoofer can request that information just as easily as the verifier.
One method that could be used to prevent faking is GPS receivers with
"tamperproof" digital signature capability, which would not only receive
the location information but sign it; that's not much more secure
than just having a "tamperproof" token in the first place.
As far as the multipath issues that some people have brought up,
I searched for "MacDoran" on altavista, and found several papers
on GPS multipath, so they're aware of the issue, though I don't

As far as jamming 9-bit-bytes across a bus, that almost certainly _is_
8 bits of data and one parity bit; people have been agitating for
and debating parity on memory busses for a long time.
AT&T's Datakit switch (an ancestor of ATM) used 9-bit bytes on its data busses,
where 8 bits were data-from-outside and one bit was a control-vs-data indicator,
which let cards listening to the bus decide whether to think about the byte
with their control processors or just shove them onto an output wire.

Some algorithms have usable inverses, but good ones try not to;
one class of known plaintext attack is working your way back through
the algorithm to discover the key bits using the known parts.
Another kind of attack is just to brute-force the key, assuming the
algorithm or key length is short enough to do that quickly.
Algorithms vary widely on their susceptibility.  Consider a one-time-pad:
even if you know the first 256 bytes of the transaction, all that does
is let you recover the first 256 bytes of key, which will never be used again,
even in the second half of the message.   Pretty useless, usually.
On the other hand, consider a simple "xor with the key, repeating as often
as needed";
if the key's no longer than your known plaintext, xor again, find the key,
repeat as often as needed, and you've got the whole message.
Using the same technique with DES will be left as an exercise for the reader :-)

X.25 is an interface between a Data Terminal Equipment and a Data Communications
Equipment, rather than a whole-network format like IP and TCP.
X.25 networks often have random proprietary internals, and they're designed
for a world where there IS only one network, because after all, there's only
one Phone Company; the X.75 protocol lets X.25 networks talk to each other.
But if you look at the higher levels of the protocols, they're not really
that different than TCP applications - you've typically got a listener application waiting around for connections from client programs.
It feels a bit less peer-to-peer because usually the service you want
is the X.3/X.28/X.29 stuff that's X.25's equivalent to telnet,
so the server end is a MainFrame, and the client end is a terminal pad
that you've connected your 3270 or dumb terminal to.  But you can do other things as well, if your computer environment will support it.
} you can call X.25 a lot of things, but proprietary is not one of them. } X.25 did not fail because it wasn't open; X.25 failed because it was crap
It's not dead yet, and you can't even say it's failed, given that it's still
in wide use in much of the world.  X.25 was design to work on networks with
really bad bit loss - we're talking modems on barbed wire here, or whatever
the French use instead of barbed wire, and in days when computers were _slow_.
Yes, it's bureaucratically designed, and parts of it genuinely are ugly,
and it does lots of work at Layer 2 that these days you'd do at a higher layer.
And, yes, it's a lousy environment to do full-duplex character echo over.
But it works ok for a large fraction of the world's data communications,
which are designed for less interactive environments.  It's fine for email.
It's fine for 3270 fill-in-the-blanks applications.  It's fine for pre-Web
online service applications like CompuServe.  It reeks badly
for client-server applications which do a dozen little handshakes per
which are designed assuming they're on a LAN and fail badly when stretched
across an ocean, but you'll find they often do badly on frame relay as well.
Are the Internet and Frame Relay both better ways to do anything than X.25?
Would I want to do interactive work on it?  Of course not.  Would I like to do
another project getting vendors to modify their X.25 and CLNP to support a set
of seldom-used options that some security consultant once convinced one of my
customers they needed?  No way.  Was I susprised that not only does AT&T still
use X.25 in some of its older dialup networks, but that it's still very big
Well, yeah :-)

Summary: factorization of RSA-130 using the Number Field Sieve
Keywords: factoring, Number Field Sieve, RSA
On April 10, 1996, we found that
RSA-130 = 18070820886874048059516561644059055662781025167694013491701270214\

has the following factorization
RSA-130 = 39685999459597454290161126162883786067576449112810064832555157243

This factorization was found using the Number Field Sieve (NFS) factoring
algorithm, and beats the 129-digit record that was set on April 2, 1994,
by the Quadratic Sieve (QS) factoring algorithm (cf. [AGLL]). The amount
of computer time spent on this new 130-digit NFS-record is only a fraction
of what was spent on the old 129-digit QS-record (see below for details).
For information about NFS, see [LL]. For additional information,
implementations and previous large NFS factorizations, see [BLZ, DL, E, GLM].
We used the polynomial
     5748,30224,87384,05200 X^5 +  9882,26191,74822,86102 X^4
  - 13392,49938,91281,76685 X^3 + 16875,25245,88776,84989 X^2
  +  3759,90017,48552,08738 X   - 46769,93055,39319,05995
and its root 125,74411,16841,80059,80468 modulo RSA-130. This polynomial
was selected from a list of 14 candidates provided by Scott Huddleston,
after extensive sieving experiments carried out by Joerg Zayer at the
University of Saarland.
Sieving was done on a great variety of workstations at many different
        28.37% by Bruce Dodson (Lehigh University)
        27.77% by Marije Elkenbracht-Huizing (CWI, Amsterdam)
        19.11% by Arjen K. Lenstra (Bellcore)
        17.17% by contributors to the www-factoring project (organized by
                  Jim Cowie, Wojtek Furmanski, and Arjen Lenstra, among others)
         4.36% by Matt Fante (IDA)
         1.66% by Paul Leyland (Oxford University)
         1.56% by Damian Weber (University of Saarland)
Except for a relatively small part of the contribution of the CWI and
the entire contribution by the University of Saarland, all contributors
used the NFS sieving program that was developed at Bellcore. This program
uses `lattice sieving with sieving by vectors' as introduced by Pollard
in [P], and is based on the implementation described in [GLM]. The main
difference is the more liberal use of `special q-primes' that define the
lattices (see also [E]). Unlike [GLM], these special q's do not necessarily
belong to the factor base (as is the case in [P]); this idea can also be
found in [B].  Another difference is the more liberal interpretation of
the factor base sizes, which results in a much more flexible memory usage.
These changes allowed us to run the sieving program in parallel on almost
any number of processors, as long as they have at least about 6 megabytes
of memory. This was exploited in the Web-based sieving effort, which used
a collection of CGI scripts ("FAFNER", from Cooperating Systems Corporation)
to automate and coordinate the flow of tasks and relations within the
globally distributed network of anonymous sieving clients. As a consequence
almost any user of the Web can contribute to future, larger factoring efforts,
simply by a few appropriate mouse clicks.
The changes also made it hard to estimate how much time was spent on the
sieving stage, because the performance of the siever strongly depends
on the amount of memory it gets. We can say, however, that we would have
spent about 500 mips years (i.e., 10% of the computing time spent on the
129-digit QS-record) if we had done all the sieving on average
workstations with at least 24 megabytes of memory.
Sieving started in September 1995, initially on a very limited number of
workstations. The Web-based sieving started relatively late, in December
1995. Relations were collected and merged and duplicates were removed at
Bellcore. On Jan 14, 1996, we had 56,515,672 unique relations. In
uncompressed ASCII format, with only the primes >2000000 listed per
factorization, storage of the relations required more than 3.5 gigabytes.
With a rational factor base of 250,001 elements (the primes <= 3,497,867)
and an algebraic factor base of 750,001 elements (ideals of norm <=
11,380,951), the breakdown of full and partial relations is as follows.
\ number of prime ideals of norm > 11,380,951:

Once every week during the collection the cycles were counted at Bellcore.
The final collection of 56,467,272 relations with one or more large primes
generated 2,844,859 cycles. In these cycles 18,830,237 (33.3%) of the
partial relations occurred (i.e., were useful). As in our previous NFS
factorizations, we witnessed an explosion in the number of cycles, with
first a sharp increase in the number of useful relations, followed by a
sudden growth of the number of cycles:
        # partials      # usefuls       # cycles
        41,319,347          47,660         16,914
        45,431,262       8,214,349        224,865
        53,282,421      11,960,120        972,121
        56,467,272      18,830,237      2,844,859
Using the approach sketched in [DL], these data resulted in a
3,504,823 x 3,516,502 matrix of total weight 138,690,744 (on
average 39.4 entries per column). Using Peter Montgomery's Cray
implementation of his blocked Lanczos algorithm (cf. [M95]), it
took 67.5 CPU-hours and 700 Mbyte central memory on the Cray-C90
at the SARA Computer Center in Amsterdam to do the linear algebra.
This resulted in 18 useful dependencies. These were processed on
1 processor of an SGI Challenge (150 MHz R4400SC processors) using
Peter Montgomery's square root program (cf. [M93]), which took 49.5
hours per dependency (with initial numerator and denominator of
approximately 9.7 million decimal digits). The factorization was
found by the third dependency.
It is likely that slightly more sieving (and therefore more partials)
would have led to substantially smaller (and easier) matrix and square
root problems.

Some processors can do more than one instruction per clock cycle,
though loads and stores are usually a bit slower.  But you only need to
load two words every 128-160 clocks, which is easy on a pipelined machine.

Depends on the space of ideas that are leading to your passwords.
If the reason you're adding spaces is to separate an n-character word
from the dictionary from a 7-n character word from the dictionary,
this reduces the search space for a cracker considerably.
At least pick random punctuation instead.
On the other hand, if your password is a bunch of randomly chosen
characters, having another character in the space doesn't hurt.

At 09:46 AM 4/16/96 -0800, jim bell  wrote
various amusing paranoid conspiracy theory :-) about software patents.
I tend to agree that the concept is bogus, and it's further aggavated
by the Patent Office's technical incompetence in the area which has
led to granting of patents for things that are well covered by
prior art and obviousness to skilled practitioners.  However.
The first software patent, AFAIK, was Dennis Ritchie's setuid patent from Unix.
I'm not sure when it was granted, but it must have been applied for
a couple years before Diffie-Hellman was developed.  Unlike RSA, where
it's fun to talk about RSA/PKP/etc.'s evil conspiracy with the government
(in spite of the foreign citizenship of one of them and some amusing
uncooperativeness that's let them pull off when threatened) but it's way
bogus to argue that in the case of Whit Diffie (I don't know Hellman.)
While PKP did acquire the Stanford patents for a while, they weren't the
ones who applied for them and didn't form for a while after they
were granted.  Remember that RSA was developed a couple of years after DH.
The patents are carefully written to make it clear that the process is
"protecting private data" rather than "Crunching numbers in some
mathematically interesting way."
(Other than Canadians..)  The reason that RSA isn't patentable in other
countries isn't because the US is the only place that permits
algorithm patents (many countries do, and even provide more than US;
e.g. IDEA is patented in Switzerland.)  It's because most other countries
don't grant patents after publication, and because of the major FUD that
the NSA cast over cryptographic research in the 70s and 80s, it's been
necessary to publish the theory before applying for patents - if you do
it the other way around, the NSA can slam patent secrecy orders on
your patent applications, like they did even for a wimpy analog scrambler
for CB radio in the late 70s (which _was_ clearly done to impair American
access to crypto..)

@_subject: Re: Spaces in passwords 
The context is Unix passwords, which are limited to 8 characters,
not arbitrary-length passphrases like PGP uses.  The size of the
dictionary of words you can use to put two of into 8 characters
is fairly small; the natural choice for two words with a space is
a 4-letter word and a 3-letter word, both chosen from English dictionaries,
though 5/2 and 6/1 are also possible.  It's _way_ searchable,
even if you're not attracted to popular phrases like "Exon You" or "Oh Exon!".
If you're length-constrained, the choice of one word limits the maximum
length of the other.  If you take away another character for punctuation
or space, it reduces it even more.  If I were writing this on a Unix box,
I'd check the number of words in the appropriate length categories, but it's
pretty low, and there's probably a lot less entropy in 3-character words than 4.

Those who don't remember Unix are condemned to re-invent it :-)
There have been _lots_ of papers done on the topic, and lots of
programs written; there's probably a good chunk of material in Knuth as well.
How quick is "quickly"?  How big is your dictionary?
"grep" is probably not the right model, since you have the opportunity
to pre-sort your dictionary.  "look" does a binary search on sorted text, which can be very fast for general applications; you can go faster if
you want to play with indexing and hashes, using lots of programs like dbm.
If you're looking up a bunch of words at a time, you probably win by
looking up an index table before looking in the dictionary itself,
since it'll be in cache or in your program for all but the first look.
If your dictionary is under 1MB, the useful parts of it may stick around
in cache long enough to avoid multiple disk reads, especially if
you're able to pre-sort the words you're searching against as well.
On the other hand, if it's 100MB, and you're using a large machine,
it's worth using maybe 100-1000KB of hash table to speed up lookups.
Somebody mentioned the use of a bitmapped hash-table to get a quick check
on whether an entry is probably there; there was a paper in Usenix's journal
about 5 years ago on this by one of the Bell Labs Research folks,
probably Doug McIlroy or Peter Weinberger, in the context of a spelling
checker.  If the hashes aren't expensive to compute, and you get a small percentage of false hits, it's cheap to look them up in the real

understand the quality of the randomness you're getting.  One of the central
concerns is finding the underlying patterns and the random noise driving them,
though in this case we're looking for the noise and dumping the patterns
rather than the opposite.
Some things that are good to look at are first and second differences of the series (e.g. take Y1=X2-X1, Y2=X3-X2, ... and Z1=Y2-Y1, Z2=Y3-Y2... and on up
for higher differences) and look for distributions and patterns there.
You may also want to look at moving averages (take a window of K samples
and slide that through the sample space, for several values of K.)
This stuff is similar to Fourier-series analysis for discrete-valued data.
If you want to read lots of gory details on the math, the book by
Box and Jenkins on Time Series Analysis was one of the best textbooks
~20 years ago.   As my professor put it, if you stare at the numbers long
you can find all sorts of things in them, which may or may not really be
there :-)

Good luck finding something.  You might want to see if there's a Norton
version for OS/2; their Diskrete product for DOS may not be the highest
quality system in the world but at least it's a start, and maybe they do OS/2.
There are two ways the Bad Guys can get your system, or the data off it -
they can get a search/seizure warrant, or they can subpoena it into court,
and you have a lot more control over the process with a subpoena,
though the court may be able to compel production of your password
(that's debatable, and it's been much debated here and on Cyberia-L,
but a search or seizure warrant _can't_ get your password if it's not
written down.)
Therefore, if they do a seizure, and your file system is encrypted,
the Bad Guys can trash the whole thing, or random blocks, but without
the password they can't selectively delete data, and trashing the
whole thing could look _real_ bad for them in court.

@_subject: Re: Memorized secret keys 
An interesting approach; given enough spare computing, the passphrase
is the key.  Remember to transform the passphrase space into some
wide-enough space that it will include a bunch of primes, to avoid
having multiple passphrases generating the same prime.  Primes density
is approximately log n (ln n?), e.g. 1/512 for a 512-bit number,
so a crude approach like using a 128-bit hash as the most significant bits
should do fine.
Almost by definition, you want at least 128 bits, since you'll probably be
using the public key crypto to protect a 128-bit session key.  (Keys for
signatures may need a bit less slack, though I'd still be wary of <90 bits.)
Also, if you're starting by taking an MD5 of the passphrase (after looking up
the words in the dictionary or whatever), you're limited to 128 bits of
entropy; it's probably worth using SHA, or at least picking p from the MD5
and q from the MD5 of the reverse of the passphrase.

There's an interesting Moore's Law wrinkle to this.  Not only
does processor speed double every 18 months, but the cost of the
chip fab plant for each generation of technology also doubles.
Intel's building some $2B plants now, and who knows what the
x886 CPU and 256MB memory fab plants will cost.  While the costs
are somewhat lower for a low-volume plant than a high-volume one,
at some point it will be much harder (as a percentage of their
total budget) for the NSA to stay ahead of the power curve,
and they'll have to switch over to designs like highly-custom
applications on commercial FPGAs and such.
And "appropriately cleared staffs" are also harder to find as
the chip business internationalizes.  Back when I was a tool
of the military-industrial complex, I was working on an RFP that
had a heavy-duty "buy American" policy, not only for economic
protectionism but to make sure that UnAmerican Foreigners didn't
subvert the designs for critical components to add security leaks.
For instance, the controller chips for disk drives, and raw EPROM.
We eventually got them to let us use imported commercial
products as long as any design and construction that was actually specific to the customer was done in the US, on the assumption that
the Singaporean Espionage Service wasn't going to put back-doors in
all the disk drives their city exported, and the Korean CIA
wasn't going to put extra pins in their EPROMS that would replace
the contents with hacked versions designed to steal US Secrets :-)

@_subject: Re: WWW proxies? 
Good timing for the question!  As Perry pointed out, the CERN
httpd provides basic proxy functions, but it doesn't do the
anonymizing job of deleting/replacing information your
browser may output to a CGI script, so it's only a partial solution.
The pre-beta-test anonymizer proxy Sameer mentioned does the main
protocols, though doesn't anonymize https: yet; doing the job
right is difficult or impossible without support in the browser
for features such as double-encrypted SSL sessions (one layer
of encryption between the browser and proxy, and an end-to-end
connection between the browser and the destination server.)
        [Jeff - any chance of this unlikely feature being supported?]
I tried doing an https: connection to the proxy, but something
wasn't in the directory it expected; that's what betas are for :-)
Alternatively, maybe an SSH connection could work?
That's partly a technical question, and partly a social/economic one.
The technical parts are whether it's easy to install an anonymizer
on your web server (at least for Unix and maybe NT users),
and whether there's a big drawback if you do, like performance hit
or extra charges from your ISP.  There's also a technical issue
of whether anon-proxies will be quiet underground things,
or whether there'll be some convenient coordination mechanism,
such as random.anonymizer.com being a DNS hack that picks a
random anonymous server that can be temporarily registered
by just starting an anonymizer application.
The social parts of the question are how we get people to _want_
to install it, and how we get them to keep running it once
it gets annoying.  A good PR job can help, especially if
installation+registration is a one-or-two-button thing;
using one anonymizer nags you to install your own.
Perhaps somebody will find a convenient way to add
only-mildly-annoying advertising to the anonymizers,
or to collect digicash without discouraging users,
giving some tradeoff between social responsibiity and
crass profit motives, and allowing a spectrum of anonymizers to operate.  Of course, especially with
some profit-making services (e.g. the Anonymous Porn Proxy
or the Hemp Buyers' Privacy Connection)
the server may have trouble convincing customers that
the anonymity is really being preserved, whether from
government subpoenas, junkmail and credit card fraud,
or future resale to Blacknet.
The other side of the propagation problem is keeping
proxy providers willing to run their services after they
have problems because of how their service is used.
One problem is spammers and other abusers.
Suppose somebody uses your anonymizer to connect to
a web-posting page or mailto: and spams a big mailing list
or newsgroup with objectionable material, like the
 spammer who sent hate mail from my
remailer to the various gay newsgroups signed with
some innocent bystander's name.  At best you get flamed;
at worst your ISP drops your service.  Or the spammer
signs the guestbook at whitehouse.gov in an interesting manner.
Another problem is users whose behaviour attracts attention.  Maybe it's the highly legitimate user who checks out the tax forms on irs.gov for taxable activities the IRS didn't know were involved in, like overseas banking and stocks when
_your_ tax returns all said "broke college student" (just _try_
explaining anonymizers to the compuer-illiterate IRS clerk.)
Maybe it's the user who wants to avoid junk email when she
checks out the Make.Money.Fast.multilevel.religious.technology
stockbroker service.  Guess who's now on Their lists.
Maybe they used the anonymizer to view child pornography from
kidporn.sting.postalinspector.memphis.usps.gov, and the Post Office Police come kick your door down.   Or maybe
they were checking out the schedule at the Cannabis Buyer's Club
using your anonymizer just in case the FBI wiretappers wanted to
enforce laws that the S.F. Police don't bother people about.
Some of these problems can be helped by things like transient
proxy servers, if we build a convenient way for them to hook in
for a while and drop back out.  On the other hand, if you're waiting
for me to write all this code I'm suggesting we need, you'd
be better off hacking some more easy partial solutions that can
be deployed, tested, and replaced with the next edition :-)

In addition to the posted weaknesses (which were mainly implementation issues),
there's another major problem with this - it means that the user's passwords
have to be stored on the Host machine (or an authentication server) in _plaintext_, rather than storing a hash (e.g. like Unix passwords.)
This means that if the host's password file is cracked, the entire system loses.
You can do a little better than this by having the password file encrypted
with a key which the login process / authentication server has, requiring theft/cracking of that key (difficult) as well as theft of the password file;
the encryption could either be a symmetric-key system or public-key if you're
willing to spend the decryption time, which CompuServe probably isn't.
A couple years ago I found an obvious application of Diffie-Hellman which
avoids this problem; unfortunately it turned out to be patented by someone
from Siemens (first as a German patent and then a US patent, so it's
definitely too much trouble to try to overturn the patent...)

The attack they use spends most of its time precomputing information about

Check out  and
 for more information.
There are some standard TCP/IP protocols for time.
You can check the RFCs for more information on them,
and look in whatever your operating system calls the "services" file.
There's a simple "daytime" protocol which gives the time in
hours:minutes:seconds at 1-second resolution, in ASCII or
binary, over TCP or UDP.  It's dumb, but it works fine
if that's enough resolution for you, and there are programs
to set your system clock based on it, such as rdate for Suns
and wsntime for Winsock.  There's a far fancier protocol called NTP, the Network Time Protocol,
which is a multi-tiered time protocol with servers and clients
and mutual agreement and adjustment for round-trip delay and such.
Depending on the quality of your network connections, it can
be accurate to very fine time resolutions.
It's good form for ISPs to support NTP, both to keep their
clocks synchronized and to feed time to their clients,
but not all of them do that.  It's also good form for ISPs to
keep _all_ their machines in sync, not just most of them,
as occasionally happens at (ahem) some large well-known ISPs,
especially if they're going to bill for prime/nonprime time...
Another motivation is so that tycho.usno.navy.mil and its
friends tick and tock.usno.navy.mil only get hit by a few
thousand ISPs instead of potentially millions of individuals.
Ask your ISP's administrators what they do about clock sync,
unless of course you _are_ the administrator, or your ISP
takes three weeks to respond to tech support questions like
the (ahem) large well-known ISP not named above.
I currently use wsntime to sync off cesium.clock.org because
my ISP has reconfigured their time service and takes
weeks to respond to tech support quetions, but I was using
the ISP directly for a while.

@_subject: Re: Past one terabit/second on fiber[PHONE GEEK TALK] 
No comment :-)  And I certainly don't presume to speak for Lucent....
Traditional fiber-optic technology is a hybrid between electrical and optical
components - big hulking multiplexers feed a high-speed electrical signal to a laser, which sends optical pulses down the fiber.
Every N km, a regenerator reads the photons, decides if it saw a 0 or 1,
and feeds that as an electrical signal to an output laser.  Repeat as needed.
The means that if you want to upgrade the signal speed, you not only need to
replace the muxes and lasers, you need to replace all the regens.
That's more of a problem for long-distance companies than locals
(the common FT Series G 1.7 Gb system uses them every 40 km.)
The new optical amplifiers not only go farther (e.g. 120 km),
but they do everything optically instead of dropping down to electrical
so they support a wide range of data speeds.  I don't know that
they can support the 1Tb experimental stuff, but they work fine
for the 8-color x 2.5Gb Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
stuff AT&T will be using.  This means that the first time you
do an upgrade, you need to rip out a bunch of regens, splice around
2/3 of them, replace 1/3 with opamps, and optionally replace the equipment at the ends with even bigger hulkinger multiplexers.
Depending on capacity needs, you may not fire up all 8 colors at once.
The next time you want to upgrade the same route, replace the muxes
if you didn't, or fire up more colors, or upgrade to the new Year 2005 model.
And since you've got to pick _some_ framing technology, it might
as well be SONET, which lets you build self-healing rings if you want
(the FDDI-like configuration, which not everyone uses, burns half
the capacity on restoration circuits, more than some of the less-healable
SONET configurations or mux-based restoration like AT&T's FASTAR.)
AT&T has announced that they'll be pouring lots of capital into this
over the next few years, partly to keep up with demand, and partly
to deploy SONET rings for faster restoration.
Voice compression and silence suppression aren't done domestically
(at least by most carriers.)  Undersea cables still use this,
though I don't know how much it's done on the newer fiber cables.
Of course, people running private networks do whatever they want,
and for overseas connections, people are often willing to trade
lower-voice-quality compression for the cost savings, especially
if the PTT on the far end is expensive.
A fairly common configuration for FT Series G is 8 fiber pairs
(one fiber for each direction), with 7 in service and 1 protection pair
to recover from mux-card and regen failures and other single-fiber hits.
To restore whole-bundle hits (e.g. backhoe fade), some of the 7 pairs
are typically dedicated to restoration - though seldom half.
The restoration pairs are often used for short-time reserved applications
such as TV connections for sports events, videoconferencing, or other applications where someone needs a lot of bandwidth for a short time
and is willing to be pre-empted or blocked if there's a failure.
That's _highly_ location and company dependent.  Long-haul connections
are likely to be used efficiently, because you can get economies of scale
and because growth will fill them up (e.g. across the Rockies).
Short-haul connections (e.g. around town) are more likely to have
dark fiber because the big costs are digging up streets and paying
for government officials\\\\\\\\ licenses and permits rather than
the costs of the fiber you're putting in a trench once you dig it.
And the short-haul doesn't need regens, and often uses lower bandwidth
than the fiber can handle (OC3 muxes are much cheaper than OC48,
though per-Mbps they cost more.)
And of course, _everybody_ seems to want a T3 to the Bay Area or
other Internet-heavy locations.
(The main There's a lot of cost in switching equipment as well.  A feature-rich
voice telecom switch costs _far_ more per 64kbps voice circuit than the
1/(24*28*36=24192) fraction of a fiber that carries it.  And big muxes,
while cheaper than voice switches, are still expensive.
In addition to Internet telephony, ATM switch makers are doing voice
compression, and some of the fiber vendors are starting to use their
equipment to offer business voice services.  And voice-over-frame-relay,
which has more delay and therefore doesn't handle voice as well,
also is getting some market, especially internationally.
Pricing is a really difficult problem - if you price bandwidth proportional
to the 64kbps voice circuits, it's either too expensive for most businesses
to buy much or priced too low to make money on switched voice.
But if you price high-speed circuit bandwidth much cheaper than proportional,
it becomes cost-effective to buy customer-premises equipment and bulk bits
and run your own phone services.  Phone companies have been worrying about
this for video services for years, but fortunately Moore's Law and research
have let compression improve enough that you can run cheap video on
2*64kbps and good video on 6*64kbps, so they haven't been killed.
But Internet and similar data needs are starting to demand high bandwidth
at low costs, and the market will have to catch up somehow.

The companies themselves don't have to be illegal, and the principals
and employees may have varying needs for pseudonymity, depending on
how they're organized.  On the other hand, the governments have different
possible responses to different approaches.
For instance, an Anguillan company Aliceco owned by
a non-American could sell software products, either its own (produced
by contractors from unspecified countries) or distributed for other
vendors (Bobware, in an unspecified country, delivered via the net.)
It wouldn't be illegal in Anguilla.  Its developers/subvendors might
be breaking local law by not reporting the digicash Aliceco paid them,
but that's not Aliceco's problem - especially if Aliceco bought/hired them
from Caribsoft, another Anguillan company.  And Caribsoft may not
know where they live - after all, _it_ doesn't have tax forms to fill out,
and it doesn't care where Fred or JaneDoe lives.
If Yankees or US companies owned Aliceco and Caribsoft, they'd presumably
have to report it for taxes if it made money, but a local owner making
a few percent is in a different position.
Now, the US government _could_ declare a 50% import duty on imported software
(avoiding the uncollectability of income tax) which would of course be evaded.
The government could respond to this by requiring all software
to include a serial # and the TaxID number of the vendor (if the vendor is an importer, then she'd have to have Customs Receipts
or other documentation of US origin to expense her costs for tax purposes.)
In this environment, the employees would have to remain unknown to the US,
but might be known to the Aliceco  or Caribsoft.  Of course, Alice may be a Fed,
or Caribsoft employee Paul may be a Plant, so there are
some benefits to pseudonymity; depends on how paranoid you need to be.
Or they could declare Anguilla to be an Economic-Terrorist Enemy,
covered by the Trading With The Enemies (Especially Cuba) Act.
Restricting acceptance of foriegn digicash would be difficult.

@_subject: Re:  SEVERE undercapacity, we need more remailer servers FAST 
One reason for remailers is that concealing message origin is difficult and
unreliable, and making smtp servers that include all the information they
can find about the origin of a message into the message is easy,
so it's tough to lie about where you are.  Remailers solve that by
removing the header information from messages they receive and shipping
out the message body with new headers, so anyone who traces all the
"Received:" headers gets pointed to the remailer. alpha.c2.org keeps encrypted reply blocks that it can't decrypt;
it sends messages to some other remailer that can decrypt them,
and only sends messages encrypted.
That means that anybody who does succeed in stealing or subpoenaing
alpha's user information has to go to each of the other remailers
it uses for delivery as well - and alpha doesn't have any keys to steal.
Setting up a remailer is easy, if you've got a Unix machine, and I'd guess that the Winsock Remailer is probably easy for Windows.
If you don't support mail-to-news yourself, and you block mail to
other mail-to-news gateways, you cut out lots of flame potential,
which keeps the work of running it fairly low.  (My remailer is based
on ghio2, which has traps to detect high-volume spam, which has
shut it down a couple of times.  Cleaning them up is annoying.)  You do need to stay on remailer-operators to get notices of individuals who are being spammed or harassed so you can block mail to them,
but that's typically 5-10 minutes/week.
If you've got a Unix machine, you can also do a web-based remailer easily
(users fill out a form with their mail, which goes to a CGI script.)
If you're willing to use somebody else's script, e.g. replay.com,
you can just put up the web page anywhere and won't need Unix,
and they can handle most of the spam-blocking. This isn't very secure unless you're using SSL or other secure HTTP protocol,
which I don't think any of the current web-remailers do. Some folks have put advertising on their remailer pages, which starts to be one economic model that can encourage people to run them,
if you can find advertisers who _want_ the image this gives them.
(This is fine for c2.org and maybe Digicash banks or tax-haven consultants,
some political ranters, and maybe phone-sex or other services that
don't have to worry about lowered reputations if somebody uses the
remailer to spam the alt.sex newsgroups with phone-sex ads :-)

I disagree - when I was running a remailer, I found several varieties of
abuse, and some of them were worth blocking.  Usenet, in particular,
is divided into newsgroups so material can be directed to the groups
where the readers want to find it, which is filtering, not censorship.
* The most common was spammers sending lots of mail to a specific person
who didn't want it; that's easy to block, and keeping up with that was
a major part of traffic on the remailer-operators news groups.  * Another was spammers who were sending out large volumes of spam; my remailer would shut down if it got too much volume (operator-settable), but usually I blocked senders like this based on remailer-operators notices
from other remailers that were being spammed through.
* Another was inappropriate news postings; most of the complaints I got
were from phone sex ads in the pictures newsgroups, where they're unwanted
(as opposed to misc.forsale or other group where they're in scope).
They're a minor annoyance, and I didn't censor them; there'd probably
be less of them from 2-way remailers, since people who objected could
spam back.  In general, these were posted to many newsgroups, and reducing
the number of newsgroups that a message could be crossposted to would probably
have helped, though it might have just resulted in multiple postings.
* The nastiest spam, which I wasn't able to block, was to sign someone
else's name on flamebait hate postings.  Blocking by content (e.g. blocking
postings with the address of someone who had complained) would cut down
on repeat postings, but it only takes one or two postings to get thousands
of flames sent to the victim.  The damage could be reduced by putting
disclaimer notices at the beginning and end of the text, reminding the
reader that it may be a forgery, etc.; simple mail headers don't seem
to get the attention of enough readers, even those whose newsreader
software doesn't discard them.  Similar spams can be done to mailing lists...

@_subject: Re: crosspost re remailers 
There are two ways around this problem - chaining remailers, and encryption.
As long as one remailer on the chain from your source to your destination
is not compromised, you can send mail encrypted to each remailer in the chain
(i.e. send Alice's Remailer the message E(Alice, E(Bob, E(Carol, message))))
and the message won't be compromised, though it may be blocked.
For reply-style remailers, chaining is much harder, at least if you use
a non-stealth encryption system like PGP or RIPEM which reveals the recipient's
public key in the headers, and if the remailers don't include a public key
to encrypt the message contents with as well as a key to encrypt the
connection to the next remailer with.  (Otherwise, if the sender
encrypts a message to NymA and Alice encrypts it with Bob's key and
sends it to Bob, Bob decrypts it, encrypts with Carol's key, and sends.... Zed decrypts it, encrypts it with your key, and sends it to you,
then any node compromised by Bad Guys will see a message encyrpted to NymA.
It would be much easier if there were a DNS hack that lets you connect to
dns.remailer.net:registry, which takes your IP address and serves it as
remailerN.remailer.net until you log off (using a short DNS expiration time).
This does provide a large number of interesting attacks on the system -
denial of service is easy (make lots of connections, filling all ports),
and it's easy to add subverted remailers (just connect!)  It also doesn't spoof
reverse lookups unless your system is able to handle multiple IP addresses
(which requires cooperation from your ISP's routers, unless remailer.net
is also running a packet laundry, which increases its targetness.)
Signed DNS responses would help some attacks, once that's standardized.
Does anyone have any ideas on how to do this correctly?

impractical to
The nice thing about economies of scale is that they make it possible
to do things that used to be too expensive with older technology.
For instance, the Internet has problems now because the Network Access Point
capacities are really too low to let everyone connect to them,
so there are limited numbers of powerful ISPs feeding the rest of us:
the DEC Gigaswitches handle 16 users, and the FDDI-based systems
don't have the capacity to support more than a couple T3-capable ISPs.
Faster technology may let more people on.
Faster technology also changes the balance between communications and
computing - it's really hard to _do_ anything with 1Tb/s other than
shove packets around between multiplexers.  On the other hand,
if the NSA (or NASA or Yoyodyne or some other surrogate) is on a
FDDI NAP, they can promiscuously receive all the packets that go by
and sniff for interesting addresses.
Jim Bell:
It's true that that's about 10 million simultaneous voice calls,
which is enough for about 60 million typical business phones if they
all went through the fiber, which they wouldn't, since they're mostly local.
It's alternatively enough for 10,000 uncompressed TV-quality video streams,
if you like variety in your television networks.  Or 20,000 T3s.
One major effect that happens if bandwidth becomes cheap (and I'm not sure
that the mux costs for a system that size would really let it be cheap)
is that it becomes cost-effective for far more people to get into the
phone basis, bypassing the current local phone companies.  The last mile
to your house may still be expensive (that's also changing), but the
last mile to any large office building or apartment complex isn't, for voice.
For redundancy, you'd probably use 4 fibers in a FDDI-like ring.
Most of the major long-distance carriers are deploying their SONET
as fully redundant rings, though one or two of them may still be
considering non-fully-redundant SONET configurations, and even the
carriers who are doing the Right Thing may do the Cheap Thing transitionally.

@_subject: Re: Senator Leahy, your public key please? 
Senator Leahy is the first member of Congress to publicize a PGP key.
(There are already fake keys for Bill and Hillary Clinton and Al Gore.)
A Washington-area Cypherpunk recently visited Senator Leahy's office
and asked if he could verify that the PGP key posted to the net for
Senator Leahy was correct*, so he could sign it; while it would be
difficult to fake responses to the "PGP Public Key" entry on his web page,
it could be done, and a fake key could be publicized in other ways.
He was told that there's some Congressional silliness about the issue -
what's the political implication of having someone sign your key?
Postmaster is fine, but are there ethics questions if ACT UP, Big Oil or the Christian Coalition signs it, or if Newt Gingrich
or your party's Majority Leader refuses to sign it - are those endorsements?
Tim May pointed out that you don't _need_ anybody's permission to sign
their key; just do it and send to the keyserver.  Even if they don't like you.
It's really hard to get handed a straight line like this and have to pass it up, but I'm _not_ going to create an Aryan Nations key,
and I'm _not_ going to send it to keyserver
Black Unicorn's experience at Senator Leahy's office implies there
are too many clueless Congresscritters around who would recognize
the political potential and make a Law to Do Something about it,
just as Georgia recently made a law against making links to people's
web sites without their permission.  While the Republicans in Congress,
having somehow found themselves on the side of Free Speech with Leahy against Clinton's administration, may be able to pass laws reducing the government's encryption-export and wiretapping efforts, a good scare like this could make it more difficult.  Sigh.  :-)
I haven't Cc:d this to Leahy - Should I?
Meanwhile, what should we do about PGP key signatures?  PGP 3.x is still being developed, and keyservers can be updates as needed.  While I agree that keyservers don't need to validate keys - that's a
job for the web of trust, and the keyserver-admin could sign keys
if he/she/it wanted to - it may make sense for the keyservers to only accept keys in messages signed by the key itself.  (Just signing the key
doesn't help much here; you need to sign the key-plus-signatures.)
Does it make sense to include some similar capability in PGP itself?
Leahy has at least signed his own key...

Cool.  I've got a test message going now.
Does your remailer accept PGP-encrypted email?
It's really critical for high-security applications,
at least for first remailer hops, but your key's not on
the MIT keyserver.
BTW, how do we know you're not a plant?  :-)
Aside from having an interesting nym,
you've probably got the first remailer that

@_subject: Re: An alternative to remailer shutdowns 
Is that really any different than delivering the message rot-13?
One of the reasons people object to getting anonymous email is spam;
sending "You have mail; pick up message-id  by midnight tonight!"
encourages you to go to some effort to pick up the message,
so you'll be even more annoyed if it's spam.  Similarly, for hate-mail.
On the other hand, a pickup system could reduce directed spam,
if people generally don't pick up remailer pickups unless they recognize
the messageid, leaving the remailer system to people who actually
want to communicate with each other anonymously, which _had_ been one
of the original goals of remailer systems.  Protocol support requirements:?  We could build in a fancy header,
or we could just use the Subject: line, which many remailers know
how to paste in anyway, and let the remailer do a messageid.
Response mechanisms should probably be an email message to the remailer
        ::
        Deliver-Message: 2718281828
A secondary concern is handling multi-casts - should the remailer create one copy for each recipient (secure, easy, space-wasteful),
or should it try to get fancy and keep the message for N recipients or D days?
Two ways to implement the fancy version are to keep a flag that says
not to delete the article upon receipt, while the normal behavior deletes it,
or to use different keywords for picking up delete-after-pickup and shared
The big negatives with this approach are that it doesn't support PGP-encrypted
messages, since they don't easily fit into one line, while they also encourage
people to forget that the header of their message will be delivered insecurely.
But it's probably close enough for non-anti-government work.
Of course, it also doesn't do chaining; that either needs to be implemented
by recognizing well-known remailers and forwarding directly instead of
pickup, or
by using a standard message format, so other remailers could do pickup.
It's probably worth doing both, to support other remailer types transparently
and to allow remailers to use pickups without having to be well-known.
Adding automatic remailer registration is easy, but requires care to avoid
falsely registering victim as a remailer and then spamming.
SPAM POSSIBILITIES
That still allows 1-line spams like         Subject: !  You !
or      Subject: Our new Remail-Spam(tm) system lets you fit 1015 characters
in a Subject:                       line, just like this one, so your whole
message can fit through those
                anti-marketing filters!  You can MAKE M0NEY REAL FAST
building your downline -
                send e$1 of Bank Foo ecash to the top three addresses in the
but at least it cuts down on the annoyance level.  It also supports messages like
        Subject: Secrets of the Scientologists for Sale!  Pick up message for                 free sample and price list!  Operate your own Thetan today!
which permit direct-e-mail spams, or as some people prefer to call them,
marketing opportunities.  An interesting security/legality wrinkle is that
if somebody is trying to multicast-publish unencrypted contraband data,
it's sitting around in the mail-pickup spool, it can be seized by Bad Guys /
courts / sheriffs / etc.  As with most remailers, there's also a risk that
outgoing unicast mail could be seized while in the spool, which is higher
for a pickup system because the data may be in the spool longer.

The Agreement, as written, covers all of Mixmaster; it would be easier
for people to adapt Mixmaster code if you either release a bones version
or a license that clarifies that you can't use the RSAREF portions
commercially but can do whatever you want with the rest of Mixmaster
(if that's what you want) or however much freedom you want to grant
(e.g. you may want to say some disclaimerish words about obeying ITAR etc.)
Consensus.com is doing commercial licensing for RSAREF now; there may
be some reasonably-priced approach to the problem.
RSAREF has at least three kinds of legal protection:
- contract (if you're using a licensed version)
- patent (on doing RSA-method encryption, not on the code itself)
- copyright (on the RSAREF code itself.)

@_subject: Re: Floating Point and Financial Software 
Did that earlier posting really mean Digicash code uses 16-bit quantities
for moving money around?  Yow!  The API says 32 bits.
32 bits isn't enough precision; 64 bits is almost always enough.
Floating point gives you about 53 bits, which is usually enough,
but it fails badly for accounting.  The problem is that the amount
of precision in a floating-point calculation depends on the
magnitude of the numbers, so A+D and B-D may have different roundoff errors,
which is a Very Bad Thing when you're trying to move $D from A to B.
Floating point is fine for deciding how much money to move,
but you have to move the same amount in each calculation.
Otherwise, if there's no clever salami-attack programmer siphoning off the
roundoff error, little half-bits of salami get created or destroyed
on every transaction, leaving a random-walk amount of spam or anti-spam splattered all over the accounting system, which is Not Good.
And, of course, translating fractional decimal numbers of dollars
into floating-point binary creates another roundoff spam event,
while fixed-point systems would just use pennies or mills or microbucks
and operate integrally, only doing roundoff for multiplications
such as interest-rate calculation or /12s where you're deciding how
much money to move from account to account.*
Currency conversion is a good example - floating point may give you
the most accurate number of dollars to move for a transaction of
some integral number of yen, ecus, or zorkmids, which will generally
be non-integral.  Suppose Alice and Bob have ECU-denominated accounts,
and Alice pays Bob 1 dollar, or ECU 1/1.2299=0.8130742336775 **.
If Alice's account has, say, 3.1459265 million dollars' worth of ECUs,
and Bob's has 2.718128459045 ECUs, it's easy to lose 4.6566e-10 ECUS in
the transaction, and probably more if you didn't have decimal conversions.
64-bit integers let you use, say, millionths of a cent as your currency,
with values up to +/- 8 trillion, which will handle the US Federal Debt for
another couple of years, though more bits let you use the same code for
anything from micropayment to hyperinflated currencies.
One motivation for floating-point is historical computer power limits:
bignum arithmetics on 8086s takes lots of work, especially in languages
like Pascal or BASIC without abstract data types, and it's slow,
while the 8087 chip was far faster, and handled big enough chunks of
money for almost anybody who was doing their accounting on a PC
instead of a Mainframe.

Ernest Hua and several others have asked things like:
What the NSA can't trust isn't the key escrow itself - it's the ability
of applications to work around the key escrow, so they get decent
encryption without escrow.  They also can't 100% trust escrow agents;
maybe Cosa Nostra Key Escrow has an "accidental" disk crash that
wipes out 5% of their clients' keys one week, and discovers that
the backup tapes can't be read.  Or terrorists who've been using Uncle Sam's Nephew Fred Key Escrow make him an offer he can't refuse,
just as the FBI is closing in on the terrorist ring.  It's for your
own protection, after all!  So they need to be able to crack it,
just in case.
Alternatively, they really Just Don't Get It.  Or they hope that industry
will get tired of arguing, and take the deal in return for export permission,
figuring that they've got the upper hand so they don't need to fold early,
while more and more vendors succumb to FUD and make deals like Lotus.
 Or they _know_ that nobody likes it, and industry
will refuse to cooperate yet again, so they'll go to Congress saying
"OK, we've given the industry three _perfectly reasonable_ choices,
and they're too stubborn and hostile to cooperate, so it's time to
stop playing around and just make a new law whether they like it or not."

@_subject: Re: Mixmaster version usable with POP? 
A pipe takes the standard output of the program on the left-hand side
and feeds it to the standard input of the program on the right.
On Real Operating Systems, like Unix, both programs are running at once,
so the pipe doesn't need to buffer very much information; MS-DOS fakes
it out by running the first command while dumping its output in a temp file,
then running the second command with its input from the temp file.
A program named "popclient" is almost certainly designed for fetching
mail from a Post Office Protocol server, which keeps a mailbox for you.
I'm don't know what "formail" does, but it's presumably going to crunch
your newly fetched mail through mixmaster to send it out.  (A not unreasonable
guess for what it does is to take a bunch of mail from standard input
(e.g. the output of popclient) and crunch each mail message according to
the options on the command line, for instance filing it, prettyprinting it,
or whatever.)
So this is a remailer.  To just send mail, you'd use mixmaster.

@_subject: Re: Remailers - What exists? 
Basic remailers can run fine as a mail user on any Unix system
that supports executing user-specified programs on incoming mail.
Almost any modern Unix system will do this, either through sendmail
.forward files or some similar (dangerous :-) mechanism.
Even on systems that don't do it automagically, you can
batch the mail through a remailer command either by hand or
using a cron script if your system lets you.
It helps a lot to have an account that isn't your main email
account, because it's going to get lots of junk in it
that you want to discard most of, so you'd be better
off without your real mail going there, unless you're
a procmail wizard.
Mixmaster-style remailers are more secure than vanilla ones,
but of course you need to use the Mixmaster client software
to use them, which could be a problem if you're a DOS or Mac user.
Being root gets you a couple of things:
- ability to set up multiple names to receive mail on,
  which you need to run a user-friendly 2-way remailer, like
  anon.penet.fi or alpha.c2.org.  Some sendmail flavors
  have extensions on user names ( myname+whatever )
  which would let you do the same thing as a regular user,
  but it doesn't seem to be a widespread feature.
- ability to mess with the sendmail logs
- ability to tell the backup software not to back up your
  spool directory (which would be Really Bad, especially
  if your computer provider keeps backups forever.)
  The alternative is to put it under /tmp somewhere,
  and just make sure it recovers if too much stuff gets   deleted by regular daemons.
- Extra Slack for mail-to-news gateways.  You can often
  do them without being root, but not everywhere,
  and it's harder to fake From: addresses if you're not root.
Of course, you can always run Linux at home - there are
even new versions for Mac coming out.

@_subject: Re: Tempest Info 
There was some interesting stuff on the web page about
experience TEMPEST-surfing CRTs, and Sarah Ellerman's article
is better than some of its sources, but there's still bogosity around.
Nope.  TEMPEST _is_ its real name.  It's not an acronym, and the stuff
doesn't even deal with Transient ElectroMagnetic Pulses; that's somebody's
attempt to take a non-acronym and find plausible buzzwords to fill it.
It's not just about monitors; they're just easy targets because they're
usually electrically noisy, and the stuff they broadcast is in an easily
usable form (if you've got a monitor around that can handle the output
frequencies required, which is to say it costs at least as much
as the monitor you're bugging :-).  One reason they're noisy is the
basic technology they use; another is that they're hard to stick in metal boxes because you'd like to be able to see the screen.
In the days before FCC Class A and Class B certification became
near-mandatory, there were a _lot_ of noisy devices out there;
one early dot-matrix electronic typewriter could be read a couple
of miles away.  On the other hand, random signals from your CPU's crunching
are not only harder to detect among all the other electronic noise,
it's hard to translate them into anything human-readable.
About 8-10 years ago, TEMPEST-certified computers typically cost about
$5000 more than equivalent regular computers, as well as being 6-12 months
behind the commercial products they were based on.  A big reason for
this is that certification is an expensive technical and paperwork process,
and most products aren't going to sell enough units to spread the cost around.
Sure, some of it's due to shielded cables, grounded metal boxes, and
paying careful attention to board design.
As one of the posters pointed out, you can cut down your exposure a lot
by using an LCD display instead of a CRT, and sticking to FCC Class B equipment,
which is a tighter standard than Class A.
One of the articles also described making a shielded room using some of the non-woven carbon-fiber fabric shielding, and said it didn't stop everything.
Shielding is a tricky business - modern computers have a lot of harmonic energy
in the 100 MHz - 10 GHz ranges, especially now that clock speeds are
in the 100 MHz range instead of the 8 MHz range that was common when I started,
so the wavelengths get very short and stuff leaks out easily around joints
unless you're very careful about both the technology and the installation;
you've _got_ to test a room for tightness and hunt down all the leaks
before you can trust it.  Also, of course, your electrical power system
needs to be shielded and filtered, so only 60Hz gets through,
unless you plan to stick to laptops and bring in spare battery packs.

Yup.  When you're installing a shielded room with waterpipes, it's
best to use a chunk of plastic pipe just outside the shieldwall,
and you need to make sure the plumbers use teflon tape instead of
pipe dope ( unless it was the other way around; it's been a while.)
And like crypto, there are lots of diddly little things you've got
to check to make sure you've done _all_ of them correctly.
Unlike crypto, however, it's generally easy to find out if you've
made a mistake; big mistakes peg your test meter, little ones
require you to wave the meter around everywhere and watch for
little motions.  Also unlike crypto, little mistakes generally
won't lose the whole game for you; if somebody's got to watch for
six months to accumulate enough leaked electrons to find out the
Secret Plans, and you haven't noticed the black van with all the
antennas parked out in your parking lot by then, you've got far
more serious troubles than just a few stray electrons :-)
You may also notice that you can't park your black antenna-van too near
the Pentagon.  It's not just because they think you're hauling fertilizer;
electromagnetic emanations follow this nice square-law that means that
a few hundred meters of extra distance makes it _much_ harder to detect
the signal you're looking for, as well as mushing it together with
all the other stray signals from the building.

@_subject: Re: An alternative to remailer shutdowns 
There are two major problems, which have different impacts
- protecting the users from corrupt remailers, and
- protecting the remailers from spamming or entrapping users
To protect users from corrupt remailers, you not only have to pass through
at least one trustworthy remailer, you have to encrypt the message for
each remailer in the chain so that any corrupt remailers can't read it
at least until it's been through the trustworthy remailer.
Protecting remailers from users depends on the threat.  If the government
wanted to claim that all the remailers were part of a Conspiracy to
Distribute Laundered Narcoterrorist Tax Evasion Paraphrenalia, first-in-chain remailers become vulnerable,
since the Postal Inspectors can send entrapment material to them
and document where it comes out, though the path between first and egress
can't always be documented, depending on how the remailers handle mail.
On the other hand, if the Church of Spam tries to frame remailers
by posting their own Secret Documents, they can only target the
terminal remailers and as far back as they can subpoena,
because they'd otherwise have to admit that they posted it.
There's been some discussion of delivering outgoing mail by
sending it through systems that don't add Received: headers;
it may make sense for non-root-owned remailers to do this
using telnet to port 25 instead of their local sendmail,
to prevent local logging and prevent their sendmail from
adding its own information.  Some sendmails try to detect forgery,
but systems that aren't even configured to do Receive: probably don't.

Tom Dunigan's really extensive reference list
        The ORNL proposal is at This proposal focuses on providing security in a multicast-based network
such as the mbone. The proposed solution is application-based and works with all IP-multicast based routing protocols. It utilizes the group-oriented key management (GKMP) protocol which provides greater scaleability by removing
the need for a separate key distribution center. Secondly, we look at ways of securing IP multicast from denial of service attacks.
The first step in implementing a secure multicast capability is the ability to provide group access control and a scaleable efficient key distribution
We propose implementing the Group-oriented Key Management (GKMP) protocol as the
core of our group access scheme. GKMP currently only exists as a beta version at SPARTA. GKMP has become an experimental RFC and the code will be made

There are multiple threats that remailers have to face; multiple remailers
on one machine are jointly vulnerable to some of them, but separately
vulnerable to others.  If there are keys stored in plaintext on a machine,
then root-breakers can steal them (unless it's running a multi-level secure
operating system that can prevent that, if physical security is maintained.)
Thugs confiscating the hardware or trashing the OS obviously break all the
remailers at once, though that's only denial of service and not compromise.
Offline remailers using POP, UUCP, or other mail forwarding also don't risk
compromise (if they only accept encrypted messages), because they don't
keep keys or perform encryption on the ISP's server.  For all of these cases,
the remailer-positive ISP provides a certain amount of flak catching,
but can also avoid much of it because _he_ isn't running the remailer -
his customers are, and if the remailer gets abused, maybe they'll have
to become ex-customers.  That's especially effective for ISPs that support
customers with their own DNS names - foobar.com is owned by someone other than
Sameer, and if Sameer has to squash them, maybe they start getting hosted
by Lance instead, or by AOL, or by YAISP.SF.CA.US.
Telnet-only shell account providers probably get a little less deniability than
dial-only IP+POP providers or especially dial-only IP-only providers.
(On the other hand, the fact that Sameer's systems are telnet-only means
that users can be spread around to other dial-IP providers, including
all those 10-hour AOLers he just has to keep squashing :-), while if he
had dial-up users the thugs might go for telephone records.
What kind of technical infrastructure would help run remailers in environments
like this?  I can think of three things
- Encrypted IP sessions (either IPv6, if it ever gets deployed, or swIPe)
- Encrypted POP and SMTP client/server interactions. - User-based encrypted communications (SSH? SSL?) relaying POP/SMTP.
If we're going to get convenient wide deployment before the millenium brings
the approach will either need to run on shell(-like) accounts only,
or else will need to piggyback on SSL.  Either way, rather than get everyone
to replace POP3 with CryptoPOP (they haven't even done IMAP), it'll probably
take some kind of relay that sits on your desktop machine, speaking
POP3-server on one side and CryptoPOP on the other.  And you'd have to
handle firewalls.
Is there any way to get Netscape to implement something like pop3: and smtp:
services for the client software (or do them as plug-ins)?  Adding them to
a server (i.e.. Apache-SSL) would allow SSL to do the crypto, and would
mean you could use https: proxies to handle firewalls, since everybody's
got to deal with them anyway.

Assume Alice, Bob, and Carol are on abc.com and Xenu, Yak, and Zut
are on xyz.com.  Remailing between Alice, Bob, and Carol doesn't
make appear to make much difference, but it does reduce the damage
if one of the remailer's keys is compromised.  On the other hand,
mail from Alice -> Xenu -> Bob -> Yak -> Carol -> Zut adds traffic
to the system, and makes traffic analysis more difficult,
even if the Bad Guys are watching site abc.com and have stolen
Alice, Bob, and Carol's keys.
The other threat it helps with is that if XYZ.COM gets complaints
about that evil user Zut, she can kick her off (Bad Zut!)
and still leave Xenu and Yak alone; if the remailer service
were provided by the machine owner herself she might be directly liable.

@_subject: How can you protect a remailer's keys? 
Encryption is critical for protecting against traffic analysis,
but it's tough to protect a remailer's keys.  Unlike regular email,
where you can type the key in as you read it, remailers need to
run automatically once you set them up.  Some of the choices are:
- leave it around in plaintext with only Unix file protections
        (Ghio2 works this way - does Mixmaster?  My ghio2 version has it         compiled into the binary, and I try to delete it from source.)
- type it in to a long-running remailer process         (with human intervention to start)
- SSL-based remailers, where the web server handles crypto on
        a per-machine basis instead of per-remailer
- use unauthenticated Diffie-Hellman (either hanging off
        a TCP port somewhere instead of mail, or
        3 pieces of email)
- off-line or off-site remailer such as a POP3 winsock remailer
        that makes it Somebody Else's Problem, and separates
        the remailer's public interface from the working parts
- human intervention on every message (which may not be totally
        worthless for moderated news postings, if you want to
        take that approach to spam prevention.)
Anybody have any other approaches?  These are mostly weak,
annoying, or both.

Does it have any identifying numbers?
NCR OEMed a line of ADDS Viewpoint terminals for a while,
and while the numbers no longer come to mind
(unless they're like 2920), they might look familiar
if I saw them.  This keyboard sample doesn't look
quite like them, though.  Most of their keyboards
like that were for terminals, not for PCs.
Are the connectors even PC-like?
Also, if there are function keys through F20, it might very
well be a 3270-emulator of some sort.

Cryptography policy is a matter of vital public interest;
while I assume that actual participation will be limited by the
need for a small enough group to actually get work done,
the World-Wide Web makes it easy to publish working papers,
meeting agendas, drafts, and participant contact information
so that the public can keep track of what's being done.
There's a lot of broad-level material on your web site (I enjoyed the perspective of but it would be a substantial benefit to the community to
provide the in-depth material as well.
At 08:39 PM 6/6/96 -0800, Jim Bell wrote, replying to Ms. Kamata's
press release:
Most governments already have a "national position", restricting
cryptography in ways that violate free speech by their citizenry
and interfere with commerce to varying degrees.  The US has been
one of the more egregious violators in this case, since US companies
and products dominate the software industry, and national police organs
have been strongly opposing the industry's attempts to provide decent
security for communications.  Industry, on the other hand, has been
pressuring government to allow at least enough security to prevent
massive fraud and theft and protect proprietary business communications;
some parts of industry are willing to compromise if they get this much
(perhaps with the added bribe of government contracts to make up for
lost opportunities in the free market), while other parts (especially
smaller companies, where the costs of bureaucratic compliance have more effect, and where proprietors can speak for the company)
take a far stronger view, that freedom of speech cannot be compromised.
The global characteristics of technology render strictly national
policymaking increasingly obsolete, because any individual in a free
or semi-free computerized country can develop software like PGP
which can at most be blocked by vigorous local government action.
There are two added forms of urgency - the critical need for security for
electronic commerce, which is growing rapidly and increasingly in conflict
with nationalist military policies, and the increasing deployment of
technology which reduces government control.
Was the meeting announced to at least the public in advance?
The schedule on the web page mentioned the 8 May meeting,
at least after the fact, but does not list any of the following
meetings, and there's no identification of your BIAC committee's
members or even the member governments participating.

@_subject: Re: How to explain crypto? 
It's probably close enough for anti-government work; the relative strength
depends a lot on whether you're using general-purpose computers or
custom crackerboxes, and on the state of the art in factoring technologies.
I'd be tempted to be verbose and say that public-key systems like RSA
use prime numbers for keys, so they need to be a lot longer than
secret-key algorithms like DES or RC4 which can use any number as a key but
need to keep it secret.  You can double the cracking effort by adding
one bit to a secret key or about 10 to a public key. 500-bit public keys and 56-bit secret keys are about the limit of cracking technology for organizations with a couple of million dollars spare for
supercomputers, which is your desktop in 5-10 years.
The NSA's Clipper Chip used 80-bit keys, which is about 20 years' protection
against people who can't use the built-in wiretap or bribe a cop to
get a warrant.  One problem with these secret hardware designs is that you usually can't tell if there's a back-door unless they tell you - or goof up
like they did with the Clipper's short checksum.

Personally, I view this as rent-seeking by folks who ought to let

@_subject: Semi-Transcript: Pro-CODE hearings on CSPAN-2 
I caught part of the Burns S.1726 Pro-CODE hearings on CSPAN-2 tonight.
Various speakers got about 5 minutes each; most had their full testimony
in the printed record in addition to informal speaking.
Then the Senators got to grill them.  I can't type like Kerouac,
so this will be pretty random and sketchy, almost all mistakes are mine...
(Punctuation, spelling, abbrevs. etc. don't count - sorry :-)
There were several rounds of ~4 panelees I caught the first couple
but it's  ~2am.
Lots of people emphasized "We recognize the legitimate needs of
law enforcement, but other things are more important to national security,
and crypto is Inevitable, inevitable, inevitable, so get used to it."
Senator Burns was showing the NTT RSA chips - he had a bit of trouble
remembering which Triple-DES pieces were 56/168/1024 bits, saying
"I have a good memory but it's short :-)"
Pressler arrived late (he's also busy marking up a tax bill where big
airports want one kind of tax and little ones want another - used this as an analogy and ducked out soon.)
He held up a copy of Applied Cryptography "I haven't read it all yet", and
commented that he could ship the book out but not the floppy.
"We've all got to take cracks at reading summaries of books like this."
"The Cold War is over" "This is government trying to catch up,
and government is 10-15 years behind." "We have to protect banking,
and protect the ability of the FBI to protect people."
Jim Barksdale of Netscape talked about how fast his company has grown;
as with other speakers like Bidzos, he talked about how if you miss
a market window, you can't catch up.  His background includes military
intelligence and working for a large cell-phone company, and he had
no problem cooperating with the "legitimate needs of law enforcement"
when they had warrants - but he considers the need for encryption to
be more critical, and considers the cat to be out of the bag.  He put up a poster with a web page a web server product competing directly with Netscape Server and products
from several other people table here today - the product's web page
emphasizes how it's not limited by US export controls.  It's SSLeay based.
Zisman from Lotus and Business Software Alliance talked; I missed most of
it and part of Bidzos's.
Jim Bidzos talked about lots of things, including the NTT chips
(Burns held them up - they're small).  Emphasizes NTT biggest company in world.  Cat's out of bag, crypto inevitable.  Flamed escrow.
"Bill Gates called the latest escrow proposal 'No proposal'"
Inevitability of real crypto internationally.
Tim Kraus Kopf of Spyglass talked about how Mosaic is OEMed by many
companies, US and overseas, and about his frustration about not being
able to provide good service to his overseas customers - not only
short-key crypto, but can't provide source.  Decided to see how much
crypto was readily available overseas, did AltaVista search for
Apache-SSL, found it all over the world - PacRim, Germany, Australia,
talked about how SSLeay is Australian-written, contains RSA,RC2/4,DES, etc.,
and is used in products like Sioux that competes with his servers and NS's.
Burns asked Barksdale about whether key escrow extends powers of gov't etc.
Barksdale "We're not against key escrow, just mandatory, but it won't work,
there isn't a compromise, there isn't some clever back door, but it
simply won't work.  If we _could_ make it work, we'd have done it
a while ago so we wouldn't be taking our time today"
"We have some national security interests - well what are they -
we can't tell you - that's like talking to a guy who keeps quoting God -
NRC report last week _had_ seen all the details and said it won't work"
Bidzos - to reinvent the software infrastructure to do key escrow would
take 3-5 years, couldn't really trust third parties to do it.
Imagine Netscape and Microsoft waiting 3-5 years doing this instead
of spending their time competing.  Pressler? Banks?  Bidzos: In my interest the banks don't understand yet
Kraus Kopf: Double encryption anyway - you'll find a safe in the locked room.
Burns: American Bankers' Assoc endorsed the bill.  Can't a warrant let
them get information without needing escrow and wiretaps?
Bidzos: We've heard aministration say the industry wants escrow -
only if you carefully interpret what that means - companies may do
their own, don't understand what justifies radical change that
brings in third parties and mandatory escrow
Wyden: What do you folks think will happen if we don't modernize?
Zisman - will really hold back technology - internet growth speed
absolutely levels playing field between largest players and smallest players
trmendously empowering to small business and what we're doing here
interferes with that.  People used to accept 40 bits, don't any more,
though big customers don't think it's a "joke" like some customers say.
this is a lose-lose proposition.
Wyden: Bidzos - we'll hear the Admin saying foreign products aren't as good,
how will we know foreign products contain what they assert?
Bidzos - it's easy - can download source code & read it, see if it works,
and it _does_ work as well or better.  2) test interoperability,
since you can import it and verify it's identical.  German and Japanese chips
very good, use US patents, high school textbooks, etc.
often overlooked cost - we'll have our lunch eaten here in the US as well,
not just overseas markets - say MNC wants secure comms, buys Japanese.
Wyden: Barksdale - concerned that overall the government has consistently
been fighting yesterday's battle - everybody was against smut but
private sector vs. smut cops, fortunately courts making good decisions
- how to catch up and be pro-active instead of behind
Barksdale - we've given fair amount of thought - dump key escrow,
dump limited key lengths, won't work, last war - it's a given.
Understand crypto only a portion of sigint, other ways start at source
or destination - subpoenas, most people who have a mind to do harm
don't use the internet, they use phones.
So what can we do that _does_ work?  Look for new ways, not restricting
old ways to make things that won't work kinda work, worst approach.
John Kerry D-Mass - My state has emormous stake, and I'm former prosecutor,
trying to come to grips with choices - how do you find out what others
selling - are they living up to level of proficiency they're advertising.
Bidzos: Largest corp in world NTT just did the chips, would deny reality
to say otherwise
KrausKopf - advantage in encryption it's easy to verify because if you can
decrypt it you know it works
Bidzos - some of the foreign implementations don't measure up, and don't doubt some US entities can exploit, but problem - process by which
deficiencies are resolved is improving rapidly, testing by import to US,
next step may be for overseas products to be incompatible with US so
if you want good security you need to buy South African instead of US,
you can buy over Internet.  They're not as good as we are, improving
rapidly, larger companies _are_ as good.
Kerry - is this inevitiability curve?
Bidzos - yep.  Intelligence folks are very good but their job
isn't to care about whether we lose market share.
K - if you know what we knew?
Z - NRC did know, 13/16 security cleared.  Market inevitability.
too much Focus on key escrow instead of getting intelligence community
equipped to deal with it.
K - Alternatives if escrow won't work?
Z - Escrow in legal sense vs. this stuff.  Impractical, and won't
catch bad guys, unacceptible to market.  Voluntary key recovery
something big companies already do, and warrants can get those from
places that use them.  These discussions going on for a long time,
being brought to a head, need immediate relief and action so we can
have a playing field where we can compete
K - you do accept legitimate needs
Z - sure, but reject idea that current policies affect that
K - so you think it's inevitable that won't work
Z - yeah K - do you believe there's potential for cyberterrorism that could
impact either defense comms or financial institutions
Barksdale - sure - that's why we need tight encryption instead of
this loosey-goosey stuff we've got.  Can you imagine pressure on holder
of key escrow for international circumvention to get that file?
KK - security depends on number of doors, not just lock strength.
Bidzos - intelligence worried about increased costs, idiot-proof crypto,
but that's the inevitability we have to accept.  Significant loss of
jobs and revenues if don't act, NSA doesn't understand market forces,
        "other than that they're doing fine" :-)
and risk backlash that could completely lose them any controls,
if we were to raise speed limit to 100 mph, you'd see us investing in
faster police cars
        Burns - in Montana we don't have speed limit :-)
Burns - are y'all saying this policy puts us at more risk than without it
Everybody - yes, we've been saying this for long time,
national security is much stronger with crypto protecting
the computers we're dependent on.
Bidzos?  We get asked what if terrorist brings down airliner?
Well, in this computer age, what if a 12-year-old does?
We need crypto to prevent that sort of problem.
Kerry - market share, clearly understand, trying to balance interests
Wyden - are you discussing software with intelligence community?
new partnership on software side like have with hardware
Bidzos - couldn't agree more - NSA thinks talking AT&T & Motorola is
whole industry.  And without prior consultation, all we've gotten has
been Clipper Chip and key escrow
Barksdale - My CTO talking at NSA? conference Friday, happy to talk
Zisman - expertise exists, much better to invest in intelligence-gathering
techniques than implementing diversionary stuff that won't work
Kerry - if you're US attorney and get a wiretap you can't read,
what happens if can't break - are we saying law enforce needs new tools
Barks - yes sir, just like conversation on street hard to tap
K - so we just have to adjust
B - yes sir
Bidzos - 40-bit agreement between NSA and industry waS that 40-bit
level would be periodically raised - we might not be having this
confrontation if NSA'd done their part and taken us seriously
Kenneth Dam of NRC Panel next on agenda - also brought with him
Jules Katz former deputy USTR, 30 years export control,
Herb Lin, staff director, has whole report
        still in printing but we can get you copies now.  volume August.
        executive summary and full statement available
Keeping confidential info private is very hard.
Criminals, corporate spies, crucial systems vulnerable to all sorts of
people.  Crypto an important, vital tool for protecting citizens privacy
and legitimate business interests.  Bad Guys can also use it.
Feds must weigh issues.  NRC study asked for by Congress.
We have diverse interests, but have strong consensus,
13/16 got cleared for classified materials, unanimously conclude
that debate can be carried out reasonably on unclassified basis.
Wider use of crypto will support everyone's interest even though
will make it harder for law enforcement.  Don't believe total drop export controls, though relaxing will help. DOmestic/Foreign version split bad at home - govt needs to make it
easier for US companies. Should be easy to export DES.  US world market leadership good for national security.  No legal limits domestically!
"National security vs. business security" is over-simplistic -
protecting civilian infrastructure stengthens national security.
Escrow promising but unproven, risky - resolving some issues
would require legislation, but there's not enough experience to
base it on anything but speculation - government should pursue
for internal use, developing policy with open public discussion.
Only way to get consensus is Congressional discussion.
Burns - we politicians will take the parts we like and throw
the rest away :-)  Why are National Security folks unwilling
or reluctant to try other approaches?
Dam - Law Enf vs. National Security - N.S. folks recognize responsibility
to protect whole country's security, including infrastructure,
so they're more balanced.  Law Enf has different concerns - they're
interested in surreptitious eavesdropping phone conversations and
data - also want to hold down crime, and computers are growing part of that,
LE under pressure to solve big high-profile crimes fast and pre-empt,
like blowing up World Trade Center.  They have other ways to get info,
e.g. subpoena, warrants, but most people don't keep records of phone calls
that can be subpoenaed, and this is the heart of their concern.
Burns - still vulnerable to terrorism because we're open and free,
but jsut as vulnerable to industrial espionage, need real crypto to prevent.
more risk from industrial than terrorists.  Thought report was very
complete on that.  Wyden?
Wyden: report ought to be real wake-up call for Clinton folks in field.

industrial vulnerability criticial, info security in INformation Age.
Dam - wants to allow >DES export for products that make plaintext available.
For people to understand the issues, they'll have to get up to speed on
a lot of issues, but they're not classified ones.

No (and the delay between your posting and my reply

In general, if the list isn't reaching you, it's occasionally because
mail is stuck between toad.com and your machine, occasionally because
the list is stuck, and occasionally because you've been dropped.
If you send mail to majordomo saying
        who cypherpunks
it will send you a list of everyone on the list, possibly including you.
(If it doesn't include you, then you know what's wrong.)
If mail's working, it usually answers pretty fast.  If mail's jammed, sometimes this kicks it off, and sometimes it stalls,
just like a posting you sent to the entire 1200+ list members would (:-).
And sometimes there's something more subtle going on, in which case you
can send mail to cypherpunks-owner and/or owner-cypherpunks
Of course, it could be that nobody's posted anything to the list
in the last 24 hours, which probably means that Hugh's implemented
the Signal-to-Noise-Improver Bot and nothing made it past the filters.....

Many of us do care about those privacy issues - computers are very good
at combining information from multiple sources, and crypto is about the
only technology that lets you change the balance of power away from
computerized centralization to individual-controlled decentralization.
On the other hand, the phrase "books that should in fact be restricted"
is viewed by many of us to be a synonym for "the empty set"; "books about
government leaders which should be restricted" is an even emptier set,
whether they're true, bogus, or some of each.
In general, a Cypherpunk(tm) approach to protecting private information
is not to advocate laws against distributing it, but to build tools to let you protect it while giving it to people that you _do_ want to have it;
perhaps to use individual contracts to protect the information,
but also to build tools to support contractual agreements and
identify leaks.  In some cases, boycotting organizations that violate
privacy is a good idea (and building alternatives can support boycotts);
flaming them for rudeness is another approach :-), and helping organizations
understand the privacy implications of what they're doing and helping
them use privacy-preserving methods instead of hanging an SSN on everything
is another good cypherpunks activity.  On the other hand, building
anonymous publishing systems so people can blow the whistle on their
government officials is a good thing, even though it may be used by
people rude enough to pry into people's private lives.
Also, while publishing one politician's cancer experience may be rude,
publishing a recent American president's growing senility should have
been done more aggressively, as should publishing the moral failures
of his Vice president....

Agitate - it worked well when Clipper first came out.
Write code to do things regular people want to do, so that they'll
be trying to ban existing material instead of new material,
and so people will get used to using encryption.  PGP is nice, but
imagine if everyone who used Netscape had windows popping up that said
"Encrypting your message to $RECIPIENT.  Cc: to the FBI? [Yes] [No]"
Remember that the Clipper initiative and development started
during the Presidency of ex-CIA-director and all-around sleazemeister
George Bush.  You could say it was dumb luck that it came out
during Clinton's watch, so he got the credit/blame, but the folks who
are pushing it have the political savvy to know they'd have far less luck
with a lame-duck Bush proposal during a Clinton "Reinventing Government"
than by waiting until Clinton's securely in office, giving him some credit,
and having the Republicans who were around when it started supporting
them as well.  [Or they could have expected Bush to be re-elected,
and figured announcing it before the election wouldn't help.  Or the
product could have just been late :-)]
Not much difference; if anything, Democrats are usually more in favor
of free speech than Republicans, and would be more likely to oppose it.
They're both a pretty sad lot, though there are occasional Congresscritters

Actually, it may even be low - Cray-type supercomputers aren't particularly
designed for the bit-twiddling you need to do DES well.  An application-
specific cracking machine can do it several orders of magnitude faster
for a smaller amount of money.  Wiener's design was two orders of magnitude
more cost-effective than the two previous designs (Peter Wayner's content-
addressible-memory design and somebody-from-DEC's GaAs chip design were
both about $50M for a 1-day crack), and those were substantial breakthroughs
when they came out.  But yes, she's giving out very misleading numbers for what cracking DES really costs, and I'd assume she's way too competent to be doing so
by accident - or at least she should be...
As far as Jim Bell's cracking cost estimates go, a Wiener-style machine
would cost about $1M for a 3.5-hour crack, or about 7 keys per day
with known plaintext.  If the on-chip penalty for detecting probable patterns
instead of specific ones is small (e.g. first cut is to accept keys which
have all the high-bits zero, which is 1/256 of the total), you should be
able to do better than three days per crack, especially if it's also not
too expensive to haul the key-schedule out of the chip on the 1/256 hits.
Double the cost if you think there's a random initialization vector,
and do other minor annoying things to the chip design if you're checking
for several popular known plaintexts and other creeping featurism,
and you're still close.  You may be willing to feed the hits from the
first round set of crunching into a more normal computer as well...

It's not particularly relevant (:-), but SAIC's position
has been discussed here....
It's not correct.  They charge $50/year (the $100 setup fee for new domain names gets you the first two years.)  This gets you the use of the
name plus support from the root-level domain name servers; it's how they're trying to fund the NIC instead of getting tax subsidies.  Before the rent policy started, domain names weren't charged for (there's no such thing as a free name server...)  They did a 90-day
grandfathering, but now they're trying to de-grandfather the older names,
and you can tell when you've got to pay from whois.
The legal issues are really unclear, especially since they don't run
all the US-based root name servers, but they'll probably get away with it.
It seems appropriate that organizations calling themselves COMmercial
should pay money for the privilege :-)  They also control the
.org and .net hierarchies.  If you don't like it, you can always
get a statist address in the .us domain or some other .xx government domain,
or find someone who's got a second-level domain that will register you
(e.g. someone may decide to rent out space in .a.com ... .z.com cheaper than NSI, or .hardware.com, .software.com, .services.com....)
The NSF is still subsidizing .edu and .gov, and .mil runs its own nameservers.
NSI's contract runs til 1998, which is about enough time to evaluate
alternatives.  .in-addr.arpa is also still "free".
There are very interesting discussions of the issues in RFC1591 and RFC1480.  You _could_ hang off odd places in the .US domain, like
calling yourself a technical school, distributed nationwide institute,
or a generic .GEN.st.US which is used for things like domain name parks
or statewide garden clubs.  But use of top-level domain names and creation
of new ones isn't precluded; it might be interesting if someone wanted
to form a .ALT domain with some automated first-come-first-served registration.
Or you _could_ just live in .in-addr.arpa space if you wanted....
About N years ago, Peter Honeyman started the .fun domain; don't know
if he's still got a nameserver supporting it.
They may have contracts with spooky people, but it doesn't really
give them a lot of control, especially since you can always get yourself
a domain name from some friendly country like Anguilla or Lichtenstein
(a high-tech equivalent of fancy postage stamps? :-)
It's more interesting to speculate on what they can do with .in-addr.arpa.
However, because the DNS root-level servers only hand out addresses,
rather than carrying your mail, it doesn't provide much opportunity
for wiretaps or other Un-American Activity.  They could do a bit of
traffic analysis (seeing which IP addresses request info for which
domain names), but it's really sparse traffic information - they're
mainly getting requests that have filtered through other nameservers
(especially if you point your systems at some caching nameserver like netcom's or aol's which tells them that one of 5 million users wanted
to know the address for .suspicious.com), and caching nameservers
mean that multiple requests for the same information generally won't
hit the root servers.  The take is further reduced if suspicious
machines are third-level addresses under either privacy-protecting
second-levels (suspicious.alias.net) or large ones (suspicious.big-isp.net)
which will get the queries instead of the root servers.

or else get the account squashed without a second thought (because they're
busy trying to get the service on line and scaled up to 500,000 people),
but the first few spams that cause mass quantities of complaints will start

"Best" really depends on your criteria for goodness....
DES has been thoroughly explored, and people have a good idea of how
strong it is and how easy it is to implement well in software.
It's not strong enough (you can do a bit better than 2**55 brute force tries,
and 2**55 isn't enough given modern computers), but you can take care of that by using Triple DES, preferably the 3-key form, which
is strong enough for the forseeable future.  It's also annoyingly
slow in software form, having been designed for bit-twiddling hardware,
but there are well-optimized versions on the usual archive servers.
Blowfish is new, so perhaps there are flaws that 10-20 years of analysis
will find.  But it's pretty good - it's small, fast in software,
and has an annoyingly slow key-schedule which makes it difficult to
use brute-force crackers on.  It's got variable key lengths.
RC4 and RC5 are also new, fast, have variable key lengths, and appear to
be quite strong if used with adequate choices of parameters.
RC5 is patented; RC4 was a trade secret, since leaked, and you may
get flak for using the _name_ RC4 in a commercial product.
40-bit keys make it exportable but easily brute-forced;
128-bit keys are quite strong.

@_subject: Re: MS-Mail Security 
Leo WONG Wing-yan You have to look at the whole environment.  MSMail typically runs
on MS-DOS / Windows PCs, on a network using Microsoft file server
protocols over TCP/IP, so it has all the vulnerabilities of that
environment.  (It can run over Novell Netware instead, which has
a somewhat more secure file server, but the system is still vulnerable.)
The easy attack is to use a sniffer or other ethernet eavesdropping
software to listen for MSMail messages on the LAN - they're not
sent encrypted.  It also runs over dialup, and the dialup and
LAN versions rely on a user-typed login name and password for security,
but don't require that the password meet any minimum standards
for length (empty passwords work just fine.)
MSMail is typically used for two different kinds of business applications -
a purely internal mail system that doesn't connect to the outside world,
or gatewayed to SMTP or UUCP to connect to other locations.
I don't know how secure the gateways are, but the places I've seen them
used they certainly haven't been reliable, and generally have been heavily
hacked on by the users to make them do what the users want, which probably
doesn't add to either the reliability or the security.  The mail client
has its own set of problems, such as choking on messages with more than
30KB of message body.  My purely personal non-official opinion is that it's the third worst mail system I've ever used.  (IBM PROFS is the worst,
and I watched someone use the original Prodigy 1200-baud 24x40 lines with
advertising on every page nonsense as well.)
For those of you who aren't familiar with MSMail, the .mmf file
is the big hulking file that MSMail keeps all your mail in,
including new mail and mail filed in folders (you _can_ split it
so your Inbox resides in one .mmf on a mail server and all
your other mail folders are in one file on your PC.)  The main effects are - if the file gets corrupted (perhaps by a bad disk block, or because the "operating system" crashed while you were using MSMail), you can't read the undamaged pieces,
- if you received a message that the MSMail client can't handle,
like a large text message, you can't read it directly from the mail file
using a text editor like Emacs.
I haven't tried to crack it, but the experience of people who've
cracked other Microsoft Office encryption (e.g. Word, Excel)
has been that it's been pretty wimpy.  It does prevent casual
users of your PC or server from reading your email by looking
at the file with an editor or by using the MSMail client without
the password, but I'd be very surprised if it kept out a professional
who wanted to take the time to attack it carefully.

Decentralizing control is a good thing; after all, that's what the domain name hierarchy is _for_.  One cost of decentralized control
is the need for coordination between different parts of the namespace.
Another cost is the need to move between namespaces if the
namespace owners either fail or implement policies you dislike.
Having one namespace owner per country plus a couple extra for
non-nationalist namespaces is a convenient approach for accomplishing it,
and worked well when the number of users was small enough that
managing namespaces was a low-volume non-political effort.
That's no longer true.  And as long as the namespace management
is coupled with nameserver administration, which it probably needs to be,
the number of toplevel domains will need to remain small,
and the namespace managers will be motivated to charge money
for names as a way to pay for the nameservers and administration.
Opening up the top-level namespace lets you out of NSI's control, if you can coordinate with them and the country-based namespace owners,
but doesn't solve the basic problem.  If you don't do it carefully,
you'll end up needing a bunch of Above-Top-Level nameservers that
serve the names of the tens of thousands of top-level domains.
Karl's draft is an interesting approach; don't know if it'll work.

of rsync, it needs a checksum to detect packets with different values
so it can determine whether to send an update packet.  It's concerned with
people changing _data_ in non-malicious ways that you want to detect,
so the security issues about MD4 and MD5 aren't relevant, though systematic changes to data resonating with the hash function are.
You can use _much_ simpler hash functions than MD5 - go check out a book
on error correcting codes and related math.  Most error detection applications these days use 32-bit polynomials, since they're good detectors
and can be implemented very efficiently on 32-bit hardware.  They're
useless for security, since you can invert them, but that's irrelevant.
If that's not reliable enough for you (and it may not be), there are polymomials in lengths like 64 bits or 128 bits that should
have good change detection, not be too sensitive to patterns in data, and be _far_ faster than MD4 or MD5.  If I remember right, rsync was looking at using 16- and 32-bit checksums
to get a quick probable result and MD4 as a backup; you can save yourself
work by just calculating the 128-bit function and using the first 32 bits
as a quick check.  If you're _sure_ you're not worried about birthday
problems in your collisions, a 64-bit checksum is fine,
and will be even faster.

That sounds like you're getting newer telephone technology.
In the US, most areas with newer telephone switches offer you
the choice of flat rate service (you pay a constant price per month
for calls in your city or other local area) or measured service
(you pay a lower price per month plus a few cents per minute
for local calls.)  In many places with measured service,
the phone company measures how much time you use for local calls,
but doesn't record who you call, only how many minutes.
For long-distance calls, which always charge for time,
they do record what number you call.
For computer users, there are two issues -
- recording who you call is, of course, bad - if you have flat rate telephone service, you can stay
connected to your Internet provider full time,
instead of calling up every N minutes or when you have mail.

Cool.  As other people have noted, the game port may do timing things
that can degrade the quality of your random numbers a bit, so don't
use too many bits per sample unless you really understand its behaviour.
Other people have also commented that this is bad, unless you can
show that the math behind it works well and usefully.
The real randomness you have is from the radioactive decay intervals,
plus or minus any gain from the game port hardware.  No need to muck that
up with RC4, especially in ways that may add predictability.  Be very careful with statistics - if something's grossly skewed, the usual
tests will pick it up, but they can't tell if there's a mathematical way
for somebody who knows data point N to predict point N+1.  If you look
at the output of your geiger counter system, you'll probably see a roughly
exponential distribution of time intervals between hits (which is the
result of uniformly distributed events like radioactivity) modified a bit
by your game port behavior (e.g. the times may all be multiples of 1ms or 17ms.)
You can extract decent random bits from this by inverting the distribution;
if you want really high quality randoms, at lower resolution, you can do something like pick two samples and return 0 or 1 depending on which one is shorter - especially useful if you don't trust the game port.
Your generator can't give you more real bits than that; the RC4 just
obfuscates it, makes it harder to evaluate the real strength, and
evens out the distributions.  You could still crunch the bits through
MD5 or something, but only use as many bits of output as you're sure
the generator is really giving you.

The cute trick you can do with cookies, which is probably used by

The CGI program is able to look at the HTTP_REFERER variable,

If the mailbombs are all coming from one place, over a period of time,

Applications like Netscape's SSL don't give you the ability to feed your

Also, some 40-bit systems put known plaintext at the beginning of their

or something silly like that.  If you want to hide a small PC in your

and have a Real Operating System so you can run it in the background
(since your disk drive is presumably much faster than IR),
I suppose you could do that.
The main use of TEMPEST here is to detect backup systems hidden in the attic that they hadn't noticed.  Hiding it in your stereo

want to resell your stereo, and info thieves have been known to

My take is that, if you can ignore scaling, the best approach
is probably to have a central server that doles out keyspace
and wraps around when it reaches 100%, and doesn't worry too much
about collecting results - even if there are cheaters, machine
failures, etc., and people don't finish their keyspace,
it'll be more likely to cover the whole space than randoms.
(Make it a web page, and use cut&paste to transfer to the
search programs so they don't need to be network-equipped.)
To support scaling, make it easy for people to run subset servers;
grab a chunk of keyspace from the main server and dole it out
to people who ask you for it.  If you want to get fancy,
hack a DNS server to allow people to register their machines
as NNN.descrack.org, 0<=NNN<1000, so that people can find subsets without having to ask the main server.

@_subject: Re: www.anonymizer.com 
I suspect the primary reason is "that takes work we haven't done yet"
rather than anything more cryptographic :-)  However, there are
a couple of theoretical problems with doing it as well.
0A) Suppose You and Webserver are secure by definition (because
        otherwise you're hosed anyway....)
0B) Let -s- denote an SSL connection and --- denote a non-SSL connection.
0C) A connection from You-s-Webserver is as secure as SSL.
1)  A connection from You-s-Anonymizer-s-Webserver is less secure,
        because any flaw or breakin or dishonesty or compromise
        of the Anonymizer compromises the security of your connection.
1A) You may get ripped off or arrested if the Anonymizer's compromised
1B) The Anonymizer may be liable if you get ripped off through it.
2)  An SSL connection may carry a certain amount of indentification
        data across it (I'm speculating a bit), which isn't
        really what you want in an Anonymizer.
3)  A connection You-s-Anonymizer-s-Webserver may not always work
        the same as You-s-Webserver, because the latter may make
        assumptions about the connection that don't hold with the former.
3A) Of course, that's also true with non-SSL connections*,
        but there's less likely to be money riding on the deal.
3B) In particular, there may be different identification data
        passing across the Anonymized connection than the non-Anonymized.
3C) You may trust the Anonymizer and not the Webserver, or vice versa,
        and SSL probably isn't designed to do both correctly.
3D) The Webserver may trust the Anonymizer and not You, or vice versa,
        and SSL probably isn't designed to handle those correctly either.
4)  The Anonymizer may have different encryption types/strengths
        than You or the Webserver.  4A) If You only do 40-bit RC4 and the Anonymizer can do 3DES,
        the Webserver may think it's got a secure connection
        when your end is weak - especially a problem if the Anonymizer
        is a popular wiretap target.  This can be remedied by
        having the Anonymizer only make https: connections to
        Webservers at the same strength as its connection to You,
        which either requires annoyingly complex programming (bad)
        or a cheap hack like running several Anonymizer servers,
        one with wimpy encryption and one with strong encryption.
4B) If You have a strong crypto connection to the Anonymizer and
        the Webserver only has wimpy RC4/40, there isn't any good
        way for the Anonymizer to tell you about it - so your
        browser may be happily telling you it's got a two-toothed
        3DES/RSA-2048 connection while it's really just RC4/40/RSA-512.
4B1)And that happy Java+JavaScript application your browser is         running can check that it's got the MachoCrypto flag set
        and send your credit card number and Secret Plans to the
        Secret Plan Evaluation Service Website, which is a Bad Move...
4B2)Maybe you could program the Anonymizer to check out https:URLs         to see what kind of crypto they support, and return         anonymizered URLs that use the different-strength Anonymizers
        referred to in 4A.  Not sure this would always work.
5)  The extra RSA encryption from using SSL would probably cause a
        non-trivial amount of extra load for the anonymizer machine.
Summary: Having said all that, I'd probably still like to have it.
* Frames, for instance, do bizzare things when anonymized, at least
with Netscape 3.0b5.  Frames are, of course, _evil_, and are banned
by the CDA, and anyone who uses them should be flamed mercilessly
and forced to use Lynx on a 24x80 monochrome display until he or she
repents and sees the error of their ways, and if that doesn't work
they should be exiled to AOL with only Microsoft Word Internet Assistant.

That was my reaction as well.  I'd assume that if twenty cypherpunks
rob a bank, either it's one of Eric's party games (:-), or else they probably conspired over the net to rob a bank by computer.
1) The bank probably knows which bank got robbed.
2) The public probably won't hear about it.
3) The cypherpunks might or might not.
4) The number and identity of the cypherpunks is unknown,
        both to each other and to the bank.
5) If all twenty bank-robbing cypherpunks do conspire to
        get together in a room to split up the loot,
        it's probably a chat-room or mud-room;
        it's not likely to be physical space.
6) It's very hard to kill people whose identities you don't know
        across a net that obscures their physical location as well.
7) I suppose you could kill-file them, which does cut them out
        of the voting process, and therefore probably out of the money,
        but is certainly less drastic than shooting them.
8) Besides, how do you tell who's first on the list when they're
        all nyms anyway?
9) Who's got the money, anyway?  Was there some sort of secret-sharing
        protocol to make sure that the one cypherpunk holding the loot
        doesn't just telnet to Argentina.com with it?
10) Money? What money?
11) How do they conduct the voting?  Merely arguing over the voting
        protocols could occupy megabytes of list bandwidth.
12) They could just decide to use the money to pay the winner of
        a lottery to predict when somebody shoots Jim Bell.
13) But that wouldn't really take much, so there's still a lot left over.
14) N>10 of the twenty are really all Tentacles, so they can all
        vote to shoot any non-Tentacle and then vote to split the
        cash between themselves.  15) They could even killfile one or two Tentacles just to make it look
        like a fair process.
16) I _knew_ we shouldn't have killfiled Lieutenant Niedermeyer!
17) Seventeen is the mystical number.
18) If the public _does_ hear about it, the bank's stock will drop
        like a rock, and they can use the money to buy out the bank.
19) It's mine, mine, all mine!
20) Bang!

Wrong.  If 16 gets killed, 18 knows that 17 and 20 will probably split the money, so it's in 18's interest to team with 16 and 19.
15, 17, and 20 can also vote to split the money.

@_subject: Gambling Protocols 
The obvious approach is for some kind person to send encrypted email to both Phill and Sandy and offer to hold their digicash in escrow.
What kind of protocol would it take to implement this correctly?  The escrow agent needs to verify that the e-money is good (though not necessarily where it came from), and perhaps put some
kind of lock on it to prevent double-spending by the bettors.  The bettors need to be able to verify that the escrow agent hasn't
ripped them off.  (The escrow agent may have a certain amount
of reputation with the two players, but may not be in a regular
escrow business so he may be willing to rip them off, unlike a bank
which probably doesn't want to risk its reputation.  In a typical
betting-escrow situation today, the escrow agent doesn't need
much reputation because he's right there while the two bettors
are arm-wrestling, shooting pool, trying to out-drink each other,
or whatever, so he can't really abscond.)
Non-payer-anonymous double-spender-identifying e-money would be one approach - if the escrow agent rips them off, he's traceable,
and if one of the bettors double-spends, he gets fingered.
Perhaps the escrow agent should deposit the money (and a key)
with the bank and get back an encrypted set of money and a certificate
saying the encrypted money is worth $X (which lets you use
basic Chaumian first-spender-wins e-money.)
Any better approaches?

Theoretically, on the other hand, the US Government has the power to regulate interstate commerce.  (A bad idea, in my opinion,

In practice, the Supremes have let the Congress get away with
all sorts of abuses, like banning a farmer from growing grain

citizens from growing or manufacturing their own drugs because
it's difficult to tell whether a given bunch of drugs was

Unlike many pro-censorship ideas from your Congresscritters and fedcops,
Federal courts have dealt with this one, at least for magazines.
"The Progressive" wanted to publish the plans for hydrogen bombs
a few years back, and a federal district court issued a restraining order
to prevent publication.  Another magazine published the article,
and a federal appeals court dismissed the case.  (United States v. The
Progressive, 467 F.Supp. 990 (W.D. Wis.), dismissed without opinion, 610 F.2d 819 (7th Cir. 1979).)   Prior restraint is extremely difficult
to get away with, and when the information is already widely available,
such as simple pipe bombs, it's just not tenable.
Now, there are subtleties to building them that may require some amount of thought, rather than being totally obvious to the builder,
and there are things that are obvious but are difficult to do.
For instance, say you, hypothetically, wanted to blow up your government's
legislative building.  You'd obviously want to pick a dark and stormy night,
say early in November, and you'd sneak into the basement with barrels
of gunpowder.  You'd use a long, slow-burning fuse, so it would blow up
the next day when they're in session, but after lighting it you'd still
run away very fast just in case your fuse speeds up on you.  The obvious
thing you'd need to do is to NOT GET CAUGHT LIKE THE LAST FOOL WHO TRIED IT.
However, if you do get caught, maybe you'll end up with your name in lights

We did Fourier transforms in third--or-fourth semester calculus in college,
but then I _was_ an engineer; electrical engineers would go on to do
lots more of this stuff, since frequencies and waveforms are their territory.
Essentially, you can look at "most" continuous functions in normal time-space,
or you can represent them in a frequency space instead,
and you can reproduce the original function by transforming from
the frequency space back to the time space.  The "Lebesgue" bit
is a precise definition of "most".  (For most of the math I did in college, "Lebesgue" was a phrase meaning "/* you are not expected to understand this */",
and it and Measure Theory got trotted out to clarify rigorously
when functions are well-behaved enough for the stuff we were learning to apply.
Most functions you use are Lebegue integrable, unless you use stuff like
"f(x) = 0 if x is rational and 1 if x is irrational".)
Discrete Fourier Transforms are a related analysis technique that work
on sets of numbers such as equally-spaced samples from a continuous function.
The Fast Fourier Transform is a particularly efficient way to do DFTs,
which was a breakthrough that made them practical to do on computers,
and Jim was reminding the previous poster that for the problem at hand,
determining the frequency spectrum of whatever-it-was, that DFTs aren't
what you need; you need the regular continuous Fourier transform.

@_subject: Re: Taxes in the digicash world 
SUMMARY:   A: Quotation.  B,C,D: usual rehash   E: Interesting conclusions
B) Basically, you can either tax income, consumption, transactions, ownership,
and the right to do business.  Ownership of land and easily traced tangibles, like houses and cars, still works, but isn't a big enough source of revenue for current government appetites, and taxing consumption (i.e. purchase) of these items is also revenue-limited.  US-based corporations are regulated - by taxing profits, they're given an incentive to report all their consumption,
generating a recording stream that fingers employees, contractors, and other corporations, making their incomes more visible.  Similarly, business licensing raises the visibility of people who might otherwise engage in profitable
(typically in the name of protecting the consumer through quality control), and often creates transaction records such as building permits.
C) Taxing bank _transactions_ isn't realistic - it encourages people to use
banks, and it's a major change in the way US taxes work.  Even with
payee-and-payer-anonymous digicash, when the digicash gets stored in an account
for translation to treecash, the bank can tell which account, though they
can't tell when and from whom you got the digicash, and if they pay interest
they must report it,
so that tells the IRS your average balance, letting them play the
traditional game of "you received $X in your bank account, prove that it wasn't taxable income"
(again, unless you're banking offshore.)  D) As long as you're buying physical stuff, it's generally either small-volume (e.g. handicrafts and artwork) or made by corporations that are relatively
because they're forced to report their incomes, or else it's material that's
purely black-market anyway, like dope.  But today's economy is moving away from
manufacturing and mostly into services; the low-paid stuff like lawnmowing
and babysitting helps support poor people, but isn't a big revenue impact.
The interesting problems occur when both your source of income and most of your consumption are communication-based intangibles - consulting, electronic paperwork, writing software, writing entertainment, selling
wares, laundering money, laundering software, laundering entertainment,
buying software, buying entertainment, buying consulting for your business.
Since the services and payment can both be delivered invisibly, that _can_
let lots of people get under the radar.
E) I think the battleground for taxation and control over the digital
economy will be
fought in two or three areas.  One is wiretapping, of course, to protect us from
narco-porno-taxevaso-terrorists; attempting to control the key management
structure will be a big part of this, since it lets you trace the players
as well as the money.  (Even if they don't get your private keys,
and can only force registering of, say, snail-address along with public keys,
that gives them much of the game.)  A related push is censorship, probably
with mandatory authorship identification ostensibly to enforce content
But the other big push will be for licensing of computer practitioners and
software -
there's been some attempt at this already, partly from the serious safety
folks and
partly from the state-level business-licensing meddlers, but I think we'll
see far
more of it as the government realizes that it's a big hook for retaining tax visibility.  Because the software business is extremely portable and
geography-independent, much of the tracking will be from the demand side.
Software for some reasonably large fraction of use may need to be
certified by either a licensed practitioner or a corporation that can be liable.

At 11:13 AM 7/30/96 -0700, frantz (Bill Frantz) mused paranoidly:
When we discussed using FPGA machines to crack RC4/40 last year,
someone calculated the cost of cracking a message at 8 cents
if you're doing enough to amortize your machine, and Eric had designed
a system that should be able to crack it in about 15 minutes for $25-50K.
The two basic search approaches are to take a cyphertext and decrypt it
trying many keys to see if you get a likely plaintext, or to take known
plaintext and encrypt with many keys to see if you match the cyphertext.
But those designs are for one-at-a-time cracks.  An interesting question
is whether you can speed up performance substantially by cracking
multiple messages at once.  For instance, if you've got known plaintext,
such as a standard header format saying "FooVoice" or "BEGIN DSA-SIGNED..",
you can try many keys and compare them with _many_ cyphertexts,
which may not slow down the FPGA very much.  Also, even for
unknown-plaintext, since key scheduling is a relatively slow part of RC4/40,
you can split the key-schedule and the block-encryption phases, feeding
one keyschedule output to multiple decrypt-and-compare sessions in parallel.
So the cost per victim of cracking many sessions may be much lower.
Just keeping the key length down to 40 bits on a fast cypher is a good start.

The PGP RSA keysize is user-selectable.
The IDEA key is not 56 bits (that's DES) - it's 128 bits,
and remember that you currently need to use brute force keysearch on it,
unlike RSA keys which have to be much longer because they have special forms and can be cracked by prime-number searching,
which is a much faster process that doesn't have to try
anything near to every 1024-bit number.
As somebody else pointed out, the 128-bit IDEA key is about as strong as a 3000-bit RSA key - though that was before the latest
factoring algorithm was demonstrated to work so well,
which means that it's probably about as strong as a 4-5000-bit RSA key.

Even with the PGP Web Of Trust, one of the difficult problems
in cryptography is how to do key distribution - if you want to
talk to Bob, how do you know you've really got _Bob's_ key
instead of a key some imposter Eve _said_ was Bob's key?
Similarly, if you receive a message saying "Bank X will pay
you $Y, signed Bank X Small-Transactions-Teller", how do you know it really came from them and wasn't signed
by some fake key that Carol genned up?  One way is to get some well-known person to sign your key,
or a chain of people which get you to a sig for the key you want.
Another way is to give out your key, often.  That way someone
who gets email from "you", signed by "your" key, can compare
the key with previous keys you've stuck on your email and
business cards, and scream if there's a mismatch.
For this, remember to use the full key fingerprint, not just
the short KeyID which can be duplicated arbitrarily.
This is especially useful for pseudonymous people like
Black Unicorn.
Another reason is just to remind people you've got a PGP key
and make it easier to look up 0x12345678 correctly than
"Joe Anonymous" or "smith".

I've heard this also, but remember that the export standards are
"whatever specific products we decide you can export" rather than a
formal law you can design to and be sure they'll obey.
The ITAR doesn't cover pure authentication software, only software
capable of preserving privacy through encryption.  Some public-key
signature algorithms only do signature, some only do privacy,
RSA does both.  Thus, especially for software like Netscape which
_does_ have encryption capabilities, they can get away with limiting
the strength of the RSA signature portion because it's part of the
encryption package, and because RSA signing is just encrypting with
your private key instead of your public key.  Someone _could_ use
an RSA signature program to encrypt short data (like keys)
if they wanted to work at it, and while bugs in software are of course
entirely unheard of that would make this easier, there's still the
risk that those Crafty Furriners might disassemble the crypto code
from Netscape and reassemble it with the limits removed.

Probably low enough, at least if they can reuse the tags

My guess about how they'll be used is to replace the bar-code
stickers used by many baggage-handling systems - they'll stick
one on at checkin, corresponding to the number on your ticket,
track them when they load them on the plane (so they know
that all the bags correspond to people expected to get on the plane,
as well as knowing the bags are getting on the correct plane),
and track the tickets to make sure that all the people expected to get on the plane actually do get on (I think they use bar-code
readers or OCR today, and that'll probably continue.)
Tim> "bag escrow" will allow other agencies--such as DEA--to sniff
Also useful for the baggage checkers at the baggage claim, who'll be able to check that your baggage tag belongs to your
ticket, and that nobody sneaks baggage out unchecked,
either stealing it or trying to pick up the contraband.
Of course they'll _have_ to check all the bags to collect
the transponders.
David>>THEN think of the RFI problems.....
Tim> The RFI problems are actually the least of the concerns, Tim> given the "code space" technology which is possible.
The RFI issue isn't just telling one transponder from another,
it's interference with the airplane's electronics.  The devices

only broadcast in response to polls - probably quieter than

@_subject: Re: Digital Telephony costs $2 
At 05:09 PM 8/3/96 -0800, Jim Bell talked about mixing telephony,
voice compression, and modem functions on future modems,
and how doing a 28.8 modem uses up most of a DSP chip,
while 2400bps voice coding and decoding also each use up about half,
making full duplex tough.
One advantage of higher-speed modems is that you can get away with
16kbps ADPCM coding, which is dirt-simple computationally;
your 386 probably has enough horsepower to do it, though a PC's
interrupt structure may make it tough to shove all the data in and
out in real time.  You still need a sound card that'll do the
A/D and D/A conversion simultaneously if you want full-duplex;
that wasn't part of the original market vision of Soundblaster,
so vanilla sound cards don't all do it.  It also has the advantage
that the data is being moved through your CPU, so encryption is
an easy add-on, rather than having one combined modem/voiceblaster
card which doesn't have any hooks for crypto or other processing.
One problem is that tighter compression methods are far more sensitive
to network latency than crude ones, and need to process more milliseconds
of speech before putting out a packet on the net (e.g. a 64-byte tinygram
is 200ms of speech at 2400bps, vs. 32ms at 16kbps.)  For modem-to-modem
communications, this is no problem; for Internet random delays it is.
Also, another big difficulty with full-duplex transmission is that you
need echo-cancelling, especially with high-latency circuits.
Half-duplex is annoying, but it doesn't echo, and it's more tolerant
of delay because you're not expecting it to have natural timing...
Given that the "3KHz" is almost universally transmitted over 64kbps
digital channels, there's really no point in pushing past 33.6 with
analog-based coding; better to just do ISDN.  (You can still do analog-only
calls if you're on an analog central office talking to someone else
at the same exchange, but it'd be a flat-rate local call anyway.
If there's anybody still using analog trunks between offices, it's some mom&pop rural telco, and you can't get 28.8 on barbed-wire...)

There would probably also be places that were owned by

In a human-created environment like cyberspace the existence
of ownable spaces is obviously true, unlike found spaces like land.  There are also found spaces in cyberspace where there's no particular
rightness to assigning ownership, and places that even if
you decide ownership through first use is a good thing,
people can decide to leave unowned or shared.
IP address space and domain name space are good examples -
property ownership is a useful analogy, preventing conflicts

There's an obvious simple way to do this which appears to be slightly wrong.
Somebody (assume it's Alice) announces a round "This is round N, size S bytes, value vvvv....", everybody who receives it does their calculations, XORs them in with the data, and passes it on.  Once it gets all the way
around (and Alice xors in her real number xor the nonce she started with),
it goes around again so everybody can see the message.
The catch is that two players can collude to monitor the player between them.
Since Eve knows what data she passed (Dr.) Fred, and their random numbers,
and Gorby knows what Fred passed him, and their random numbers,
they can tell whether Fred added any data of his own.  With a server-based
system, on the other hand, collusion that Eve and Gorby also find out
Fred's output, either by eavesdropping or colluding with the server.

MSIE also does cookies.  Netscape 3.0b5 has a nice option to let you
choose whether to accept a cookie or not.  However, what's the problem
you're trying to solve?  Sites have several ways to find out information
about you, which they can use immediately or coordinate with other things
0) Stuff the site knows about itself, like contents and time
1) Stuff you tell them by filling in forms
2) Your IP address (not always very useful...)
3) Information your browser sends (somewhat adjustable.)
4) Information your browser sends that a site asked you to keep for it
        (i.e. cookies.)
For the most part, this doesn't leak a lot of information;
even cookies can only pass things the sites already knew between sessions.
The cookie spec is well-designed, only allowing cookies to be retrieved
by the machine or domain that set them in the first place.
However, there's a way to cheat the cookie spec; I don't know
if this was intentional, but it was realized quickly by the market :-)
The issue is that your browser sends along an HTTP_REFERRER variable,
which points to the last page you visited before the current page.
It's useful for sites to find out where their pages are being referenced,
and they may (legitimately) want to only give out information if you're
coming from one of their previous pages.  This does also mean that
a page ( can hand its name to another page
or program (  by including an inline reference
to it.  But that site can send your browser a cookie marked bob.com, which is accessible by _it_, not by the referring page.  This means that if you later connect to  which references bob's
count-stuff program, bob.com can retrieve the bob.com cookie that has information about your connection to alice.com.  If alice.com and
bob.com store some identifying information (e.g. alice.com records
a connection from 192.9.200.1 at 12:34:59 UTC, and bob.com records a connection from 192.9.200.1 at 12:35:01 UTC, and bob.com stores a reference
to that in the cookie (either storing the information directly, or more
likely, storing a record-id number referencing a database entry,
and carol.com and bob.com similarly share a reference, then alice, bob,
and carol can coordinate what happened in the two sessions.
Maybe Bob just knows that there's market correlation between viewers of
Alice's Brownie Company and Carol's Congressional Consulting, or maybe
they also share the credit card number, flavors, and addresses you gave
with the search criteria you gave carol.com to find you've been donating
special brownies to that congresscritter you've been lobbying.
Without the cookie hack, the ability to correlate is limited to the
common information that you've given the two sites, which tells
them that some Netcom user with Mozilla 3.2b7.7 did it,
which isn't enough to run a targeted campaign donation request
or send out the FBI or whatever.
Doubleclick.com is the site that's wellknown for exploiting the feature,
and their web site is interesting.  If you're using 3.0b5, try
different combinations of accepting or rejecting cookie requests....

I haven't been able to find the reference, but a month or two ago
there was an article on the net or in a newspaper about the targets
of wiretapping - how many wiretaps were for drugs, gambling, tax evasion,
and of course terrorism.  The number of wiretaps for bombs and guns
was something low like 80 in the last 5-10 years - about 1/10%.         (Did anybody else see this article??)
On the other hand, the recent articles in the press about increasing
bomb-related crimes in the US; it's up to about 3000/year from 2000 in 5 yrs.
So maybe 1/10% of the bombing investigations  have even used wiretapping.
So why is Louis Freeh ranting up and down about the need to
ban encryption because he needs wiretapping to catch terrorists?
At least he could be honest and rant about the need to stop the
hordes of drug dealers and escalate the War On Gambling.

Official mail to competitors, the press, or customers is probably something
you'd want an official copy of anyway, and the employee should be
able to decide intelligently what to keep (unless your lawyers say
to always keep everything, in which case the legal department should
be responsible for maintaining the archives....)
Incoming encrypted mail you can (presumably) get an employee to decrypt.
Outgoing encrypted mail may not support that - PGP, for instance,
supports an encrypt-to-self option, but if you don't use it,
and didn't record the outgoing message, you _can't_ decrypt it.
Writing something into a policy that will get an employee fired
for refusing to do something that can't be done with the available tools
is not a good idea.  I'm not highly impressed with the idea of snooping on employees' mail, even if it _is_ your company.
If you don't trust them, don't hire them.  If you do trust them,
don't eavesdrop.   And if they're ripping you off and don't have the sense
to sneak their sotlen data outside the building by sneakernet
or other untappable mechanism, you probably should have fired them

@_subject: Anonymous Remailers at work 
One of the big problems with remailers is getting them deployed widely.
How can we create a demand for the service that will encourage
people to both (a) deploy them and (b) think of them as good rather than bad?
Aside from cypherpunks, spammers, and everyone using anon.penet.fi, there aren't really a lot of people familiar with them.
I've recently run into a couple of business problems at work
that could be solved by (slightly modified) remailers.
1) Manager performance review, suggestion boxes, and questions to
visiting honchos - there are several departments that are using
"email to the secretary who'll take your name off and forward it"
to handle this problem.  Remailers are an obvious solution.
   (More obvious if we weren't using (gack, phfft!) Microsoft Mail :-)
It would probably be worth modifying the remailer to use a permit-list
as well as a block-list for destinations and maybe sources, so that companies don't get surprised by outside spammers,
and people can get used to using the things at work.
Distribute the thing as an OmbudsKit or whatever.
You'd obviously want the default to be non-logging.
2) Sending sensitive email across the real Internet - between
customers, and for those days that the departmental dialup
mail server or remote LAN access isn't working and you need to send something from home or on the road.  A standard remailer would
do the job, though you'd probably want to add a permit-list,
and you might want to add logging and/or return receipts.
Mail to pgprelay and it distributes it....
(Requires putting a key somewhere well-known, like in DNS
or on the key servers.)
(Hmmm - an alternative implementation is to use a CGI script
to do the mailing and use SSL; some companies may find
this easier to deploy, depending on their firewall (Does it make sense to deploy something like this as a standard feature of an IPSP gateway system like John's?)
Any other reasons to install anonymous remailers at work,
and things you'd do to make them more attractive or
less scary to corporate network administrative types?

@_subject: Re: Digital Telephony costs $2 
1) Costs money - especially critical if you're trying to either
-  get a new product accepted by the market (when they were becoming popular) or
-  compete in a me-too market (after they became popular and costs came way
2) DSPs tend to be really tight on resources, especially RAM,
   which you need to do multiple programs at once.  $5-10 DSPs are    especially tight.  They're starting to come with mini operating systems.
3) They probably didn't think of Internet Telephony as a market
-  They were PC folks, and while _we_ all knew about the Internet,
   it was probably 1/4 as big as now and earlier on the hype curve
-  It's only been recently that soundcards have been ubiquitous enough
   for people to assume they're there for a product like Internet phone
-  28.8 modems are fast enough.  14.4 are marginal.  9.6 is _really_ marginal.
4) Most of their market wants other things - MIDI, game noises,
   talking applications, occasional recording and sound processing.
   Voice crunching is mostly used for answering machines and    fancy voice-response telephony units "Press 1 if you want to Press 2."
If you're doing the voice crunching and A/D conversion and telephony
all on the modem card, with everything tightly integrated
to fit in your tiny cache, why put in hooks for the processor to intervene?
Depends on the telco.  Here in PacBell's fiefdom, home ISDN costs only
a bit more than two voice lines, and you get two lines out of it.
Local calls are a penny or four a minute daytime, free at night.
This may change soon - the telco is appalled to find out that
computer people think "it's free at night" means "it's free at night" :-)
There's getting to be enough ISDN support that an ISDN-based phone program might find some market - especially if it can use
higher sampling rates and ADPCM compression to get better sound out of
56-64 kbps than a regular phone can, and maybe you could support a
shared-whiteboard program as well.  Still need to do something about
echo control, though.  However, I wouldn't recommend writing a free
encrypted ISDN telephone program, though - you wouldn't be able
to export that on the Internet.  But a phone program that lets users plug in
their own algorithms for echo control, with an API that supports
exchanging parameters - now _that_ would be a phone program.

If somebody can write a web page that, when you view it, turns off your PC,

User?  What user?   The poor unsuspecting fool who hits the web page?
The kind friendly person who writes web pages that turn off Win95?
Executing signed code from web pages is semi-ok, if the default is to
trust no one and make the user explicitly grant permission to code authors.
Executing anything that comes down the wire is foolish, and writing
software to do so is rabidly negligent.
The Java approach is to define a security model that _should_ let you
safely execute code if you implement it correctly, do some academic-style
analysis to validate the security model, document the level of
trust you can expect from the system, and then put out a mildly buggy
implementation of the system so grad students can rip it to shreds :-)
So far the security problems that have been discovered have been with
the implementation, not with the underlying security model.
And then add a similar-looking language called Javascript with no
underlying security model, make it impossible to turn off, and get taunted mercilessly until you add a "Turn it off" checkbox.
The Microsoft approach was to take a hacked-up word-processor gluon,
from the folks who brought you the Word Prank Virus Propagation Tool,
hack it up some more, add Internet hooks, and replace a few bugs with
different bugs while trying to catch up with the market leader on features.
Yes, some of the removed bugs were security bugs, but it's nothing near

I've worked with companies that bring Indian contract programmers

Sure, part of the lower price paid for programmers in India vs. importing
the same people here is probably because the government is annoying.
Why is it worth paying nearly-American-scale wages to have them
do the work here rather than 1/5 as much back home?
Part of it is because it's harder to interact with people halfway around
the world, even using email and faxes, so the jobs that succeed well
in that environment are big jobs with well-defined inputs and outputs.
For work that needs real interaction between the customer and the worker,
it helps to have the worker nearby, so it's worth paying them to come here.
For work that needs interaction between workers and machines, especially
brand-new-not-yet-working machines on high-speed networks that aren't
easy or cheap to drag across the Pacific and then connect to India,
you need bodies on site.  Even for standard equipment you can buy
more of, it's still more productive to work here where you have lots of it

Also, of course, the folks who are good enough to ship halfway around the world to do a job for you are usually the best they've got;

Agreed.  At least for now, banking havens are a different kind
of market than data havens - people want to be able to demonstrate
that activities are being run from Non-Taxing states, though there's
a parallel need for private data communications to hide any connections back to a potentially more greedy state,
and perhaps to move money back home as well.
Data havens, on the other hand, may need public ports in tolerant
locations, but most of their business really needs to be
encrypted any way; the visible parts such as web pages
are only a small part of the game.  I suspect that, rather than
having fixed physical locations, they probably need to operate on a
Temporary Autonomous Zone basis, moving elsewhere when a jurisdiction
becomes unfriendly but mostly trying to avoid too much notice.
Reification is one thing; developing business models and markets
is another, and making the activities visible so potential users can
_find_ data havens is a third.  There are some activities that
operate as temporary data havens today - child pornography, warez, police Red Squad and blackmail files on citizens kept illegally on home
machines outside the public's control, and other unsavory groups that limit
the people who know about them.  Public data havens are a bit different.
Finding a reason to Just Do It means you either need a real threat model
or you end up becoming Yet Another Spam Server like many of the
remailers have been.  Some things we need to implement Data Havens - 1 - digicash or equivalent - it's coming, but it's not widely used,
and if you can't pay anonymously it's tough to pay for data havening
2 - practical temporary registration of connections - is hacking
a DNS server enough?  Or do we need IRC meetmes?  Not sure.

AT&T was about the first vendor with that feature.
Aside from solving a _lot_ of potential security problems,
it was very convenient for finding out what device really

MAC address received on each port, and you could compare that to
ARP tables and untangle lots of problems.  Not as fancy as a Sniffer,
but let you do things that a Sniffer on ThinWire couldn't.
(Of course, since it wasn't NSA-rated, the fact that it actually did

A multi-port bridge gives you similar security capability,
but generally costs more because it needs buffering and
much more intelligence; the AT&T SmartHub was a lot simpler and
(in its day) cheaper.  It was about twice the cost of a regular hub,
half the excess from cool features and half because it was from AT&T :-)
It was less reliable than the regular hub, because it needed a fan
to handle the extra heat from the processor board, and was also more awkward to mount.  And the SNMP implementation was
rather buggy, though it did have a convenient PC SNMP manager
that knew how to use SNMP-over-MAC and the special features of the hub.

@_subject: Re: Protecting floating datahavens? 
Oceania was perfectly doable, if you're cynical about its objectives :-)
It did great T-Shirts, got people to pay for newsletters, and even
got enough donations to get an architect to build a cool model
while keeping its head promoters in the Floating-Country-Promotion business.
One of the things that inspired people to believe in them is that there's
a floating hotel that used to hang out in the South Pacific, though it
may be in the Caribbean by now, which cost something like $20M for
a 200-room hotel.  The Oceania folks designed a billion-dollar
exravaganza that would be far more affordable per resident,
but it's a much bigger, and unrealistic, risk.   The basic risks with such things are:
1) Getting governments to agree to leave you alone.  If you're doing a
        high-visibility call-yourself-a-country approach,
        and your country doesn't include Real Above-Sea-Level Dirt,
        you're really gambling on whether the UN and big countries
        will recognize you.  If you're just calling yourself a
        big houseboat, and don't upset the US Drug-Confiscation Pirates
        too much, you don't need to care as much about this one.
2) Getting governments and other pirates to actually leave you alone.
        The Republic of Minerva, back in the 70s, had real dirt
        (or at least coral reefs, and met the UN 1-foot-above-high-tide
        standards) near Fiji, but the Kingdom of Tonga invaded them
        after about six months.  Calling yourself a country
        is one way to attract adverse attention, but also has
        some protection.  Allowing people to use politically
        incorrect substances is another, and if you're allowing
        politically incorrect data, you're inviting governments
        to plant child-terrorist narco-pornography to justify
        "police actions" against you.
3) Making it work financially, for the proprietors and tenants/co-owners.
        Free-market enthusiasts generally assume this is doable,
        if the upfront/interest costs of the place aren't really prohibitive.
4) Convincing investors that you're safe enough on 1) and 2)
        that they're willing to risk the money to build/buy a
        country and hope it stays independent long enough to make a profit.
        With Oceania, it would have made much more sense to raise $25M,
        which is doable, to buy the floating hotel and declare independence.
        (Either one really rich guy, or a hundred yuppies of the         type that buy quarter-million-dollar condos in Maui will do.)
        Raising a billion dollars against that risk isn't.
        Raising a million for an oil rig, if they're that cheap,
        is also doable, though the politics for something
        anchored are different from a ship.
There's also a Laissez-Faire City project, which proposes to lease a
10-mile-square chunk of land to rent from any cooperative third-world
government for 50 years or so with a deal of local autonomy.
It's much less threatening to the Old World Order than calling yourself
a country, and you've got a government which is making money by
leaving you alone that at least discourages the most likely invaders
(itself, and the US) without having to provide much national defense.
Who knows, maybe they'll actually do something, and rent a chunk of
Costa Rica or Somaliland or whatever.

@_subject: Re: key escrow idea from David Staelin of MIT Lincoln Labs 
Matt Blaze posted Ron Rivest's summary of Dave Staelin's suggestion for a different type of Government Access to Keys (GAK) policy,
and Rivest's proposed variant and analysis, and there's been
some discussion on the Cypherpunks list, including the usual
"GAK is evil, period", plus commentary on the variations.
Below I suggest a variant on Ron's variant that's less evil,
though less desireable to the government than Ron's.
R(S)>Here is Staelin's idea:
R(S)>	(1) You can use any crypto you want, but you must keep a record
R(S)>	    of the crypto keys you used.
R(S)>	(2) The government can ask for the crypto keys later, if they have
R(S)>	    a court order, just as they can ask for any of your other papers
R(S)>	    or documents.  You must give the key(s) to them, just as you
R(S)>       must turn over your private papers in such a situation.
For technical reasons, this is a non-starter.  Storing keys requires memory,
and many practical cryptosystems need to generate large numbers of keys, or run in environments such as cellphones and password-calculators that
don't _have_ any available memory.  Storing lots of keys implies a high
probability of losing lots of keys, and Matt's talked about the difficulty
of storing keys securely.  Non-technically, as was discussed,
US citizens aren't required to keep personal papers or documents,
though businesses are required to keep some tax and rule-compliance records,
and taxpayers who want to claim deductions need to keep relevant records.
Ron's trusted third party variant:
R>In a variant of Staelin's proposal (my twist) you could append to each
R>encrypted message an encrypted form of the message key.  The
R>encryption could be with the public-key of a trusted third party who
R>will not (and legally may not) reveal the message key without
R>notifying you first (or ensuring that you have been appropriately
R>served with the corresponding warrant).  For example, the ACLU might
Stewart's untrusted first party variants:
Why a trusted _third_ party?  I don't trust third parties with my calls.
Have the sender generate, and keep, a Master Key, and append the
session key encrypted with the Master Key.  As with Staelin's method,
the government can subpoena or warrant the master key.
(So you can call it a Self-Incrimination Key if you like.)
If you use a public key for the SIK, there's the time and space
required to do public-key encryption, but the session keys for each session can be decrypted separately by the sender, and verified
by the court, without needing to turn over the private key.
If you use a secret key for the SIK, it's fast and small,
though the SIK needs to be protected and one subpoena decrypts all conversations made with the key (as does a warrant seizing the phone.)
(It's basically Clipper with the user instead of NSA generating master keys,
and the user instead of the Friends Of The NSA storing them.)
An intermediate is to use a secret SIK for a small-to-medium
number of sessions, and public-key Master SIK used to generate
an encrypted SIK sent with each message as well as the SIK-encrypted session key.  It's still bulky, like the full public-key
version, but not as slow, since you can generate and encrypt
secret-SIK keys off-line.
As with Staelin's proposal, mine also doesn't give the government
real-time access, only after-the-fact access, but it doesn't
have most of the technical difficulties of secure, reliable used-key storage (hmmm - sounds kind of like a sharps-box for used needles :-)
R>The fundamental idea is to give the government a right to access
R>encrypted communication in return for a guarantee that access may not
R>be obtained until there is BOTH proper legal authorization AND proper
R>prior notice to (at least one of) the communicants.
R>Is this workable??
As Matt says:
M>While Ron's twist decreases some of the burden on the user it
M>eliminates the main benefit of the Staelin proposal - that one
M>cannot obtain cleartext without the knowledge of at least one party.
Agreed - while Ron's proposal asserts that the TTP is forbidden
to reveal the key to the government without also telling the owner,
current government wiretap laws often require just the opposite,
and even if the government initially changed their policy to
require TTPs to tell users, they could rapidly change back.
The only way to guarantee that prior notice (or post-access notice)
is for the protocol to require the user's participation, which inherently makes it non-real-time and gives the user the
ability to refuse (at whatever cost.)
Also, "to give the government a right to access" implies that they
don't have that right today (which I agree with but Louis Freeh doesn't),
and that we _should_ give them that right when we don't have to
(which Dorothy Denning would agree with but I don't) and that a Trusted Government Guarantee (TGG) is a good enough payment in return.
And if you retain the word "voluntary", as used by Ron, you need to convince a Bad Guy or an Innocent Guy to believe a TGG or TTP -
Bad Guys won't, and Innocent Guys, as Ed Meese said, "usually aren't suspects", so it's still no-win for the government.

The minarchists generally do, the anarchists generally don't,

The primary mechanisms always have been to use the market,

boycotts, or (often the most powerful) the sheer value of repeat business.

There are historical alternatives to having government do it;

non-state-based justice systems had/have various sets of social pressure
to do the job.  (For instance, Somali dispute resolutions usually end up
with some number of cows or other money getting paid to a winning plaintiff, and if you don't pay, your extended family has to.
Rarely, the family also refuses and bringing in a higher-reputation
judge fails, and a brief feud ensues...)
On the "should the government or the free market do this" scale,
most people put last-resort contract enforcement at the
"we don't mind too much if the government does it" end
rather than the "overthrow the government if they even think
about touching it" end, which is for issues like sex, drugs, rock&roll,
freedom to travel, etc.

@_author: as long as you only use the random stream once. 
@_subject: Re: Encryption 
I agree.   This method can be looked at as two parts:
1) Generate a stream of random numbers
2) Use the stream to transform the plaintext into cyphertext by shuffling.
Generating a stream of random numbers can be done by cryptographically
strong methods, or by physical methods such as throwing dice or counting gamma rays, or by cryptographically weak methods such as using the RANDOM
function provided by your BASIC compiler.  If you're using strong crypto,
the method is strong if the transform is strong.   If you're using physical
randomness, that's also true, and you'll definitely need to use agents with briefcases handcuffed to their arms to haul the randoms around,
which doesn't gain you much operational security, since the random stream
needs to be longer than the plaintext.  If you're using weak crypto,
we can use those fast computers you're so impressed with to try
all 32767 or 2**32 random streams on your input to see what works -
brute force isn't that hard when you've got a small keyspace,
even if you don't take advantage of the special forms (e.g. there are
good methods for reversing linear congruential multiplicative generators.)
How long a stream of random numbers do you need to do the transform?
And how secure _is_ the transform?  For a simple XOR, you know that
each bit in the stream will diddle one bit in the plaintext,
so you're fine (as long as you only use the random stream once.)
But for your shuffling method, you'd have to shuffle much longer
to make sure that the "random" selection of bitgroups hits all the bits,
and hits them often enough that adjacent bits will be separated.
For instance, if your message is a 3000-word set of instructions
to your fellow plotters, you need to be sure that the phrases
"gunpowder", "Parliament", and "November 5th" get shredded, not merely
moved to different places in the document.  This takes much longer
than deterministic methods, and risks not being as good.
There are some advantages with the shuffling method - assuming you've cranked the system long enough to really shred everything,
it's hard to take cyphertext and reconstruct plaintext, and brute force is a bit more work than with a deterministic method
that uses one pass.  But you can get that effect by using
stronger methods, such as the
        des | tran | des | tran | des
where "tran" is a simple key-or-input-driven shuffle that
doesn't need to be totally strong.  (Is Carl Ellison the person
who proposed this?  I've forgotten.)  #			Thanks;  Bill

Simple issues like Internet vs. modem vs. frame relay vs. cellphone
make a radical difference in performance.

voice which ones to use :-)
The non-crypto-internet-phone business has been in a similar bind,

@_subject: Pseudonym server: Jenaer Anonymous Service <anon@as-node.jena.thur.de> 
Jenaer Anonymous Service  looks like a high-security pseudonym server.  You can send outgoing mail to email or newsgroups.
It accepts encrypted email addressed to anon-hexkeyid
where hexkeyid is the keyid for a PGP key you send it;
it doesn't store any information about the owner of the key.
To pick up your mail, you send it an encrypted message
with the keyid and a Reply-To: header, and it sends you your mail
by mixmaster.
It's a bit less user-friendly than some servers,
since you not only need PGP, but you need to pick up your mail
rather than having it arrive directly.  But in return,
it's pretty secure, since you can only get caught if the
remailer or its operator are compromised when you request a delivery.
I haven't yet checked if how flexible it is about the location
of Reply-To: in the headers, since some mailers make it difficult
to paste that in.  The public key for the server is signed by Lutz.Donnerhacke
which is in turn signed by  0x3B7F286D, which MIT thinks is an unknown
The help message has a policy against illegal activity, flamewars,
and binary files, and says people can be blacklisted for abuse.
Because you don't get your reply email until you ask to pick it up,
it does seem easy to abuse; complaints, flames, and mailbombs won't reach you
if you don't ask for them.  I hope the operator doesn't mind the workload
of managing the remailer - it looks like a good service, and with
Julf's remailer shut down, we need more nymservers.

Many modern SCSI drives have them also, though you may need
to connect a switch to the appropriate jumpers.  In Hugh Daniel's
copious spare time, he's been working on hacking *bsd Unix
to cope with a write-protected root drive (you mainly need to set up
the swap partition and anything that needs writing in on a separate
drive and build lots and lots of symlinks for random logfiles.)
RM05s also let you connect them to two computers, though it was
a really bad idea to tell both computers to mount them as writeable,
since they'd scribble over the superblocks.  (This was more useful
before Ethernets became widely supported, since you could blaze away
at full MASSBUS and/or disk speed instead of 19.2kbps UUCP.)
You can play the same games with SCSI today, if you're careful.

@_subject: Encourage Singapore To Come Out Of the Stone Age 
While Tim's article title was clearly intended to be provocative,
I think the most unfortunate thing about this discussion is that
we need to have it at all.  Any government, or any individual thug,
that would impose violence on people for saying things that would bring it into disrespect deserves no respect at all.  Any government that claims to have the god-like wisdom to dictate what's best for
its subjects to hear or what religious ideas to believe doesn't
deserve to be listened to, much less obeyed.   If Singapore's government
and religious leaders want to say "Our ideas are better than American
ideas", and you or I or your neighbor want to listen to them, fine;
maybe some of their ideas are better than some of the many ideas
floating around North America.  But if you or I or your neighbor
want to listen to competing ideas, and even to believe and talk about
competing ideas, neither you nor the government have the right to
stop them - only to refute them with better ideas.
People like Tim and I aren't upset only because we believe that
we know better than you and Lee Kwan Yew how to run Singapore;
free speech is often threatened here in the US and especially Canada.
You mentioned movie ratings - they were invented here partly to
avoid the threat of government censorship.  A few years ago a
prominent right-wing religious/political leader, Jerry Falwell,
put out a "Bill Of Rights For American Families" that included the
right not to hear offensive foreign ideas like Communism.
I agree that Singapore and America have different cultures;
in an environment of free speech, if Singaporeans don't like American TV and movies, they won't watch them, and advertisers
will quickly figure this out and try to find TV programs they like.
On the other hand, if a power-hungry government decides that it doesn't
like American TV, forbids business licenses to anyone who broadcasts it,
and jails anyone who broadcasts TV without a business license,
they're more corrupt than a government that forbids business licenses to
anyone who doesn't pay a bribe.  (At least in a kleptocracy,
you can usually print or say what you want if you pay the bribes, though my father-in-law's newspaper was once shut down for printing that the mayor was taking bribes, and who they were from, and how much.)
This also means you don't know what is safe to print and what isn't.
You have to restrict yourself very strongly, because otherwise
some politically influential person will complain to the government,
and you go to jail.  At least if the government tells you what
the rules are, you know it's safe to say things that don't violate them.
Interesting.  I don't know if this is good or bad, but at least they're
It also means that if enough people want information badly enough,
the government may know not to censor it.  On the other hand,
a government that can keep the leader of an opposition political party
in jail for years just because he opposes them is pretty corrupt.
The right to speak freely without government thugs shutting you down
and throwing you in jail or killing you is a universal one.  The ability to get anybody to listen to what you have to say,
on the other hand, is highly dependent both on general culture
and on the interests of the individuals you hope will listen,
as well as on what you have to say and your ability to say it well.
Because I have a mouth and a conscience, and they have ears and consciences.  I certainly have more right to tell a politician in Country B not to
stop his subjects from speaking than he does to order them not to speak.
And if the politicians over here are wrong, which they often are,
you've got the right to tell them that too.  Of course, the politicians
over here usually won't listen to you, and the politicians over there
either won't listen to me or they'll add my name to the firewall killfile :-)
But it's also safer for me to tell your politicians to behave well than
for you to tell them, since you have to live with them.
It's not off-topic.  Building tools to prevent censorship is distinctly on-topic for cypherpunks, and an occasional digression into
whether it's a good idea is worthwhile.

If somebody were to put together a one-page note on other remailers,

A canonical cypherpunks approach would be to just write one and
send it to na000001 ..... na600000
but I assume either my system or Julf's would decide it was spam
and discard it (even if it were split up into 60,000 10-message chunks.)

if there are an extra 10,000 hits per day on alpha.c2.org
because of a really well-written one-page blurb, can it handle the load?

Keeping the sender's identity hidden from the recipient is a different

Conventional crypto is fine for keeping message content secure from

A well-written program is hard to exploit, but badly written programs
can often be exploited in ways that allow execution of untrusted code.
For instance, the fingerd bug exploited so spectacularly by Robert Morris
handed a program more input that it was ready to accept, and the program
stupidly kept writing the input into the array, past the end, and out
into the stack, where it could be later interpreted as executable code.
If a popular GIF or JPEG interpreter was written that badly, you could possibly devise a GIF that lies about how big it is and encourages
the program to scribble on its stack.  Now, there probably aren't any
like that, and it'd probably have to be Netscape or MSIE or Lview
to be widespread enough to make an attack like that worthwhile.
(I'd bet on MSIE, of the three of them :-)  Does Microsoft have some sort
of Really Cool Extension to JPEG, allowing Macros for Self-Modifying JPEGs,
trying to out-do Netscape's animated GIFs?)
Back when Good Times came out, everyone denied that it was possible
for there to be any risk from a text file (though, as I pointed out,
escape-sequence hacks have been used occasionally for over 15 years),
and not long after that, the MSWord Macro Viruses started appearing.

While some unions are clearly run by and for thugs, some employers have
also hired thugs to attack union organizers, and both unions and employers
have convinced government thugs to attack their opponents, though unions
generally have convinced governments to write laws with fines attached,
while employers have often had actual Federal troops shooting union strikers,
and have had police refrain from defending strikers from attack.
In a free market, there wouldn't be laws requiring or forbidding union
membership, and some unions would prosper by providing good service to their
members and to the employers that hire them, while others wouldn't.
I'd be happy to see union members able to anonymously blow the whistle on
employers that blacklist union members, though it's harder to be credible
with the public if you're anonymous, and particularly hard to get people to
"Employer MegaFooBar refused to hire [name deleted for privacy], a member of the IBCPARO, because of his union membership" without
revealing enough about the union member's identity that the employer knows,
and therefore telling all other employers to know that the guy is not
only a union member, but also a troublemaker.
In this case, the technology is more strongly useful for maintaining
blacklists than for detecting or outing blacklist users.
Unfortunately, that's especially true because government taxation and
anti-immigrant policies require that employees provide employers with
a [mostly] unique ID number and papers to prove who they are,
so you can't just show up at a construction-workers' hiring hall,
call yourself Joe, and get your pay in cash at the end of the day.
(Unless you're already an illegal immigrant, in which case it works fine,
but then it's tough to be a union member.)

At 03:54 PM 9/2/96 -0700, someone purporting to be
[EFF / Unicorn rant, deleted. ]
As a former remailer operator who quit because of spam,
and may restart when I can hack together a spam-reducing remailer,
let me comment on this.  We're only beginning to understand the technical questions for the parts of the problem that technology can do.
One problem is that the technical definition of spam is
"I'll know it when I see it", which is hard to write code for.
And the definition of "offensive" is "one or more letters together,
viewed by the appropriate reader", and remailers are good at finding
that sort of reader.  A lot of it is social, not technical.
But improving blocking capabilities and news-cancel capabilities helps.
And some problems are just _hard_ technically.  Take 2-way remailers -
encrypted reply blocks aren't perfect, because the system that
handles them can decrypt them.  Nymservers that depend on a different
system supporting encrypted reply blocks help, because it forces
Bad Guys to subvert two systems to identify the recipient,
and you can chain that sort of thing to make it harder.
But it's still tough, and that problem is fairly well-defined.
Getting rid of vaguely-defined things is tougher.
Mike Godwin has suggested that some of the major problems on the net
are the results of "cheap speech".  It's easy to send insults and
hate email to people, nearly anonymously, nearly free, when only a few
hostile people would bother doing it with paper mail, and most newspapers
wouldn't print it.  The News Media Establishment is threatened because
anybody can broadcast anything they want to millions of people without
spending millions of dollars for an artificially scarce TV channel
that requires government permission to broadcast on.  Readers are
swamped because 25 million Internet users sending one line of text per day
make 2 GB of Usenet/Web/Email, which is three or four orders of magnitude
beyond what most people can actually read.  Scale is tough,
and problems that are half-solvable at one scale may be insolvable
at the next order of magnitude.
Anonymous remailers support several things I want to do,
and that I want other people be able to do:
1) Let people have private conversations without being identified
by third parties.
2) Let people have private conversations without being identified
by each other, voluntarily and respecting each others' rights.
3) Let people broadcast things to the public that they might
be afraid to do otherwise.
4) Let people broadcast things to the public without their
reputations, good or bad, affecting readers' reactions.
5) Let people experiment with different personality and
conversation styles, though this doesn't strictly require anonymity.
6) Let people communicate with government officials without risk.
Not all of these things are always good; people can abuse them if
they want, and one reason for experimenting with different kinds of
remailers is to try to balance the good and bad that comes from
facilitating those conversations.  Technical capabilities of the
remailer will affect how people use it; two-way-ness is a big win.
I blocked president on my remailer real early, though that's mainly because the government has this silly law
against threatening the President.
An interesting formulation.  While there are more issues than
just preventing retribution, theft, and prejudice, that would be a good start.
Unfortunately, the two approaches I can see to achieving it are
1) Have a perfect world with perfect people in it and
        perfect people running human-rights-respecting governments
2) Don't let them know your name.
While there are groups that are working on bringing us closer to 1),
or at least as far as "1a) Have a semi-tolerable world where the
government doesn't harass you very much for what you say and
doesn't single you out as a source of funds for their great plans",
those folks have a long row to hoe.  We can do something about 2).
I'm happy to work on 1a) with people, though I won't see it in
my lifetime, but you and I can work on 2) today, and accomplish something.

@_author: send it mail saying "help". 
@_subject: Re: Secure anonymouse server protocol: comments please 
Several people have talked about this sort of thing recently,
inluding William Geiger, Doug Floyd, and myself.
Lutz Donnerhacke's Jenaer Anonymous Service actually implements it (send it mail saying "help".)
Rather than using a human-selected userid, it uses the
PGP keyid to make IDs like anon-1a2b3c4d
If you encrypt the id using raw RSA and constant padding, this is a risk.  If you encrypt it using PGP, which uses a random session key, it's not.
If you encrypt it using raw RSA and pad the id with a random nonce, it's
also no risk.  In the latter two cases, the encrypted material is different
every time, so you can't compare with previous messages.
The Jenaer nymserver avoids this by using a remailer approach -
you send an encrypted message with a Reply-To: header telling where
to send the accumulated mail (which may, of course, be another nymserver),
and it delivers it using mixmaster.  This frees you to send your pickup requests by anonymous remailer as well.  It's still not risk-free,
since if Bad Guys crack the remailer or force the operator to operate it
while they monitor it, they can see pickup requests, but it's far
more difficult to do that than to just steal the box, and there's
no database on the box that's useful to steal.  Lutz does recommend
chaining your Reply-To: to another nymserver, but it's already very secure.
I don't remember if he gets fancy and requires the pickup requests
to be signed by the key of the owner or not; the only difficulty with this
is the syntax of PGP, which is "fixed in 3.0".
Hal Finney has also suggested a system that, instead of delivering
anonymous email to the recipient, sends a message saying
"You have anonymous mail, receipt   Send back this ticket
to pick it up."  and you can extend the syntax to handle
automatic blocking requests and automatic deliver-everything requests.
This is fairly easy to extend for anonymous mailboxes
and datahaven code.  I've wavered between the delete-on-retrieval model,
which is fine for email and not very useful for samizdat,
or the delete-after-some-time-period-or-request model, which is useful for both but makes it easy for users to turn you into the local
pirate-warez-and-child-pornography server.  If you extend the model
and charge digicash for storage, it becomes a much cleaner solution.

As with any other crypto system, the rule is "you need to
get the NSA's permission, which they'll give if they feel like",
rather than any well-defined rule you can depend on.
However, the usual guidelines for systems like RC2 and RC4 is
40-bit keys, and RSA keys up to 512 bits for encrypting session keys and 1024 bits for signatures, plus you have to
structure the code so people can't easily modify it or
use it to triple-encrypt in ways that make the triple-encrypted
version stronger than 40 bits.
Also, if you're using Real RC2, you may need permission from
RSA Data Systems, Inc..  If you're just using the algorithm that
came out on the net that looks suspiciously like RC2, you may or may not.

@_subject: Re: DON'T Nuke Singapore Back into the Stone Age 
The Karla Homulka case and other criminal trials aren't the only
censorship in Canada - there are far more serious problems.
Zundel's problems (his legal ones, not just his moral ones) are well-known,
as are the Dworkin/MacKinnon-inspired anti-pornography laws which
Canada uses to censor lesbian bookstores and gay magazines.
For the most part, other than sex and drugs, Canada's censorship is the
pro-human-rights-politically-correct-liberal-hypocritical variety rather than the Singapore-style anti-human-rights-order-enforcing-
politically-correct-dictatorship variety.  But it's not only illegal to sell unapproved drugs in Canada, it's illegal to sell materials advocating drugs or their legalization, or of course information on how to make or grow drugs as well.  (This helped Mark Emery get the capital to start his Hemp store in Vancouver by selling Cannabis magazines door-to-door :-)
(It turns out that, since hemp seeds don't contain THC, they're not
illegal in Canada, and hemp stores he's started or encouraged
have sold enough seeds to grow more dope than Canada's police have
confiscated in the last year or two.  Mark openly violates the
censorship laws, and his shop occasionally gets raided, and after
the last bust they've decided he's a co-conspirator with everybody
who's grown drugs using seeds or light bulbs bought from him,
and they're playing a FUD game about whether to charge him
with 8 life sentences, in under-5-year pieces....)
Vancouver newspaper columnist Doug Collins gave a talk on censorship at an
international libertarian conf. in BC recently, which Emery also spoke at.  He knows the subject fairly well, since some of BC's censorship laws were written just for him.  He's one of those anti-immigrant anti-Semitic* WW2-veteran curmudgeons who's got an editor who lets him write whatever he wants, and he offends a lot of people.  In BC, and to some extent in
the rest of Canada, you can be charged with human rights violations
for disparaging ethnic and religious groups, and he's been tried
and defended himself successfully for that, because Canada does have
some limited protections for free speech in their Charter.  So BC wrote a law
that allows the BC human rights commission to fine people for human
rights violations with just an administrative proceeding,
not requiring a full-scale trial, and you generally can't get a jury
in Canada for crimes with punishment less than 5 years in jail anyway.
He hasn't been busted under the new law yet, but his publisher has
spent about $30K in legal costs trying to make sure it doesn't happen.
        [*He knew better than to specifically say anything anti-Semitic
          while he was talking to us, but he referred to Jewish groups
          that oppose him in ways that implied he probably was.]
And of course Canada has broadcasting licensing requirements
that prevent people from starting radio and TV stations whenever they
want to, plus a huge government broadcasting company, but they're not
as limited as Singapore on that, and there are other countries with
that problem.  And of course they have silly language laws in Quebec,
but they don't really limit what you can say as long as you say it
in French (or Chinese or Vietnamese or just about anything except English
and maybe Native languages.)

That's not a big problem - you can buy telephone credit cards,
anonymously, in your local convenience store.  Around here you've
got a choice of cards where the announcements are in Spanish and
the rates to call Mexico are cheap, cards that come in exact $20
from machines that don't give change, cards with pretty pictures
on the front, cards with advertising, etc., as well as cards that
are reusable and want some personal information about you to activate.
I don't blame phone companies in New York for using non-coin-phones,
especially non-monopoly phone companies.  Collecting and handling
coins is expensive, phones get vandalized to steal the coins,
it's harder to change your rates when you need to go to
each phone to do it, and people get annoyed at coin phones that charge
higher than Bell prices.  What I do get annoyed about is that most pay phones won't accept calls,
they'll only initiate them.  This means that if you call somebody
from a pay phone who only has a beeper, or if you don't have a beeper,
you can't leave them a useful message to call you back.  Part of this
is done because of the Great Drug Hysteria, but I suspect part of it
is that pay phone companies don't make money receiving calls,
so they don't want to tie up their phones doing that; perhaps if
they charged money to receive calls as well as initiate them,
they'd be willing to receive calls?

15 August 1996            ISODE Consortium Delivers an X.509 Certification Authority The ISODE Consortium has delivered a new security management tool, Caviar,
designed to create and manage a Certification Authority (CA) for the deployment of the X.509 Authentication Framework. Caviar, a Tcl/Tk utility, enables an administrator to effectively manage
public keys and certificates so that data transmission can be provided securely across networks. The tool allows the administrator to create a CA, to generate, locate and revoke certificates, to manipulate user keys, and to construct certificate revocation lists. Public key cryptography is widely used to deliver secure data transmission. The generation and control of public keys, however, require management, and for this purpose, X.509 describes the notion of a 'trusted' authority referred to as the Certification Authority. The CA is responsible for endorsing the identity of users whose details may be held in the X.500
Directory, and the CA issues a certificate to authenticate the user's name and public key. The Caviar tool, using an intuitive graphical user
interface, enables an administrator to create and manage these certificates easily. Tcl/Tk is a graphical scripting language openly available from Sun Microsystems Laboratories. Scripting languages provide inherent flexibility
and extensibility, and Tcl/Tk is portable to a wide range of UNIX (X Windows) and Microsoft (Windows) platforms. Behind the graphical user interface, Caviar has an underlying command mode tool kit, which can
be used if individual commands may more easily integrate into operational
environments. Furthermore, Tcl/Tk allows a high degree of customization, which enables ISODE Consortium customers to develop their own scripts and graphical user interfaces for specific applications based on Caviar. The ITU-T, through X.509, recommend strong authentication based on public key cryptosystems as the basis for providing secure services. The ISODE Consortium uses X.509 as the core of its security strategy. X.509 provides a flexible, scaleable and manageable algorithm-independent authentication infrastructure, which can be used as the basis for a wide
range of security services such as message encryption and access control. The ISODE Consortium is the leading supplier of source technology for open messaging, directory and security services.  The primary server products are an Internet/X.500 Directory Server, an Internet/X.400 Message Transfer Agent, and a Message Store. These products provide connectivity within and between organizations in a multi-vendor environment.  The ISODE Consortium has a world-wide customer base of over 170 clients including some of the largest commercial value-added resellers, service providers and research organizations.

(The Top-Level Domain Name Wars have been breaking out in Cyberia-L,
not a usual place for technical discussion, plus popping up and down
in Cypherpunks.  Hope y'all don't mind me mixing this to both.)
Back when domain names first came in, a number of us didn't believe
that a centralized organization could pull it off, especially when
it was being done by a collaboration of the US military types
and the European Phone Companies, who were well known to be clueless.
The email world wasn't just the ARPAnet, it included all of UUCP-land,
PCs were starting to occupy their spaces, and there were various
DECish things and Berknets and other radically non-conformable architectures and overlapping namespaces.  UUCPland worked because a few dedicated people, mainly at Bell Labs and some universities, with lots of time and non-beancounted-non-billed funds, kept track of where machines lived, phone-polled sites that couldn't afford it, tried to keep track of which of the umpty-seven machines named "bilbo"
or "mozart" could talk to which others so you could occasionally
get mail to someone who lived at ucbvax!allegra!mozart!zorro!bilbo!gandalf
and know it was the same bilbo!gandalf you'd talked to last week
and maybe get mail to people reliably across complex paths.
        Pathalias was a cool program that took link data and Dijkstra'd it
        together into a relatively connected bunch of shortest paths.
The idea that Somebody Thought They Were In Charge was annoying to
many of us, especially Somebody Bureaucratic.  Peter Honeyman
set up a bunch of his machines as the .FUN domain for a while;
it was run by fun people.  Rob Pike and Ken Thompson later wrote a
marvelous technical rant called "The Hideous Name" about how
locally-based addressing makes far more sense than global -
it both reflects reality and lets the decisions about naming
and such be made by the people and processes that need to make them.
Well, domain names eventually became a raving success, just because
it was so much easier to say where someone was (administratively,
if not physically) than to guess how to get there hop-by-hop.
Separating administrative addresses from routing was an important
mental step.  Stuff like .BITNET and .CSNET were workable,
.UUCP had its real problems but eventually became sort-of-defined
relative to uunet, a machine set up as a research project that
had turned into a small business.
One of the things that made it work well was that any given machine
only had to know a manageable amount of stuff - you needed your own
subdomains, a path to the top of your organization, a way to recognize
that given patterns were high-level domains, and a path to the Root Servers - plus you needed somebody Higher Up to enter your
name and address in their administrative database so other people
could find you.  It's easy to find where to look among a few hundred
entries (a few technically-cooperative countries, a few zones for
non-countries, and a few hundred countries that didn't really have email :-)
Occasionally a country comes on board that your internal
nameservers didn't recognize, and you need to get your administrator
to add .nl or .kr or whatever.
complex database to administer, you can get anywhere.  The standard
DNS BIND tries to solve a bunch of complex _local_ problems and
work portably in many different environments, but doesn't need
to be tuned blazingly complexly to work almost anywhere.
The systems that need to go beyond that are the servers for .com
and to some extent .edu, which have to keep track of a lot more sites,
and places that have complex internal structures or are trying to
solve fancy problems like mobile users.   But doesn't need to do most of that.
I think polluting the top-level domain name space is a bad move.
While geographically-based names aren't a great choice for
representing non-small organizations, they're short, and if you
open up the entire top-level you just complicate everyone's life
and in a year or two you'll have as many people carving out space at the toplevel as you currently have in .com, raising the ego levels
without making the name space any bigger.  Now, I suppose there's a
certain nice philosophical position of being able to say
"You're .gov.fr - we're .microsoft, and we're at a higher level than you!"
or "You're .gov.uk - we're .gov.AnTir, and everybody in _our_
kingdom is there because they want to be!"

First of all, they should at most be able to tell that there are
random-looking-noise bits in there - if they start seeing patterns of
------BEGIN PGP ENCRYPTED SECRET MESSAGE------
you haven't done your job, though there are more subtle patterns
that are more annoying to hide, like the slight bias of an RSA-encrypted
piece of data; Hal Finney and others have written about this in the past.
Hiding Depends substantially on the image source and the compression
methods, if any, used on the image.  For instance, a 24-bit true-color image or 8-bit grey-scale image from a scanner with 6-bit resolution
will be pretty noisy in the LSBs, and if the Bad Guys are clever enough
to find the patterns in them, you can be clever enough to find them
and encode your initially-pseudorandom cyphertext stegobits in a way
that matches the stats of the noise.  On the other hand, if you
take the LSBs of cartoon data, with large areas of solid colors,
and start dithering them with stegobits, it's obvious you're up to something, if not necessarily what it is - be careful.
Ron Rivest posted a message on coderpunks mentioning somebody's
suggestion of building an internet-phone sort of program that
shoves stegobits into the voice compression.  I'd be extremely surprised
if you could do that with the fancier compression algorithms,
such as CELP, LPC, and friends, but it shouldn't be too hard with the
looser compression algorithms such as ADPCM and Delta-Modulation,
which need 16-32kbps and can run on really dumb processors -
you've got more bits per second to hide in, can get away with stealing more of them, and there isn't any real subtle prediction stuff
going on that you've got to work around.  Given that most of the
popular Internet Phone products don't do encryption (sigh...),
this would at least be a good cover.  (Well, assuming you've got a
credible voice conversation going and aren't saying things like
"OK, Carlos, let me send you the secret message starting ... NOW".)
[tricks  - picking your cleartext so the RC4/40 cyphertext or MD5s
have chunks of the real stego-cyphertext you want - cute.)

@_subject: Re: 56 kbps modems 
Or it can be worse.  Almost all voice traffic in the US these days,
either once it gets to your local telephone wire center or maybe before,
is carried on T1 digital connections, which use 64kbps digital voice -
it's sampled at 8000 samples/second, A/D converted using a non-linear
8-bit scale called mu-law (or A-law for Europe), and (for the most common
framing format) has a signalling channel stego'd onto the LSB of every 6th byte.
If you knew which the "robbed bit" was, you could get 63 kbps of digital data,
but since you don't, digital signals are limited to 56kbps since they
can't trust any of the low bits (analog doesn't lose much from this.)
Unless they're _really_ talking about ISDN "modems", I'm surprised
to hear somebody saying they can take 56 kbps, turn it into analog,
let the phone company quantize and mu-law the analog into 64kbps,
and still get the original 56kbps back out.  But if they can, well,
yee-hah, ISDN is nearly dead :-)  (Not totally dead; the signalling is
still useful for some applications, the convenience of two channels on
one wire pair is nice, and the fact that people can get 56kbps without
the phone company's help will pressure them into offering ISDN for
a lower price in areas where the Phone Company's idea of "all the market will bear" is substantially higher than voice pricing.)
(For Norm Hardy's comment on PBXs, the main transparent approach to that
is to use ISDN as the interface.  PBXs often use ISDN to reach either
local or long-distance phone companies, since they generally want more
than vanilla signalling anyway.)

The Hippie Of Crime  suggests that
anybody who puts a mailto: with their name on it is inviting mail,
so what he did shouldn't be construed as rude.  He also asked that
remailer operators not block HipCrime SPAM deliveries and all
mail to HipCrime because people might be interested in his
cool fractals and Java neural net lotto-predicters and anarchist pages.
I disagree, on various points.
1) There's a Robot Exclusion Standard, which uses a robots.txt file
as a convention for websites to inform webcrawling programs of sections of their directories they don't want crawled through.
The HipCrime Email Robot appears to ignore this convention -
I don't have a Java Decompiler on my Wimpy Win3.1 system,
but the strings program doesn't show the string robots.txt
anywhere in the bytecodes, which I assume means it ain't there.
2) If a mailto: on a web page is an offer to human readers to send mail
to a human or bot that handles mail relevant to some topic on the page,
that doesn't mean the author invited mail except as described in the
human-readable-language on the page, which may say which addresses
are invitations to send mail on what topic.  Furthermore, the author
may not be the recipient of the mail anyway; The Hippie Of Crime Lives Here
3) An invitation to a reader to send mail from the reader isn't an invitation to send a large number of identical mail messages.
A spam-generator like the Hippie Of Crime posted isn't designed
to add comments from the reader of the MetaSpamEmailRobot page,
it's designed to get many other people to send HippieSPAMs from the Hippie Of Crime.
4) This isn't the first time he's done this sort of thing.
I took a look at the  pages, and aside from the
Annoying Frames and Highly Annoying Evil META REFRESH auto-flipping pages,
and Annoying Animated GIFs, there were some really cool-looking fractals, and a saga about how a few years ago he was faxing fractals out to a few hundred people who he'd put on a fax-mailing list, many without asking them.
        ======================================================================
        Free FAX Fractals
        Free-FAX-Fractals was a long running FAX prank/art project,         using facsimile machines to invade office spaces with monochrome
        mathematical psychedelia. During 1992 and 1993, a list of over 500         fax numbers was compiled while roaming around San Francisco.
        These numbers were taken mostly from signs and business cards,         but many people volunteered their numbers hoping to receive
        trippy fractal faxes on a weekly basis.         ===========rest-of-saga omitted================================
Only a couple people actually complained, and the police _asked_ to
get added to the list.
5) "Anarchist Info" - sigh.  Where do people get the idea that publishing
recipes for drugs and explosives is anarchist info?  He didn't talk about anarchy, or getting along without governments, or getting rid of them.
Also, he neglects to note that you can simply _buy_ potassium chlorate,
rather than having to (dangerously) boil down bleach and potassium chloride
to make the stuff.  Don't try this crap at home, kids, and please don't
blame the anarchists for it.
Just a Hippie Of Crime, not a Hippie Of Clue.

@_author: in the correct syntax 
@_subject: Re: New Remailers? 
Raph Levien's remailer list lives at
        Most of the remailers on it are the one-way variety - you can send
mail to someone anonymously, but you don't get an address for
people to reply to you.  They're easy to use.
Some of them also support anonymous reply blocks,
which are a somewhat difficult-to-use feature - you basically PGP-encrypt
your return address (in the correct syntax), and tell anybody who wants
to reply to you to include the block at the beginning of their mail.
There have been some pseudonym servers besides anon.penet.fi,
which provide higher security, and are easier to use than anonymous
reply blocks, once you set them up (which generally involves creating
anonymous reply blocks :-)  Two of them have been spammed to death,
but the cyber remailer at alias is still up.
Send it a request for help to get information.  Raph has a new system
coming soon; see his remailer list for details.
Private Idaho is Joel McNamara's friendly user interface for
remailers and PGP.   .
Runs on MSWindows.  It made it _much_ easier to use the alpha nymserver
while that was still alive; don't know if the new version supports
cyber yet or not.
Remailer security depends on encryption - otherwise wiretappers
can watch mail going into the remailer and know where it's going.
So you'll need to learn to use PGP, but it's pretty straightforward,
and Private Idaho makes it more convenient.
The Mixmaster remailers provide higher security remailing,
also with no reply capability; you need to get special client software,
which I think isn't ported to Windows yet?
There are three popular ways to do binary attachments -
1) MIME-encoding (uses MIME headers and maybe a 7-bit content transfer
2) UUENCODE (simple-minded header and 7-bit ASCII.)
3) Mail-handler-specific headers with binary stuff following
Uuencode is a no-brainer - just stick the uuencoded binary after
the remailer headers.  As far as I know, none of the remailers are
particularly MIME-aware, but they do glue headers together.
So you could probably start sticking MIME headers after the remailer
headers and try a few times to get it to work.
Mail-handler-specific behaviour is, of course, mail-handler-specific :-)
You can try it and see, and remember that the person at the other end
may not have the same kind of mail handler you do, so even if you sent
the mail directly instead of through a remailer, it might not work.
You may have trouble getting your mail client to do what you want
for sending the message (e.g. if you use Cc:Mail or MSMail.)
I looked at the code for my remailer, which is a modified Ghio2,
though I don't think I modified this part, and it'll trash binaries.
The problem is that, after processing headers, it shoves the rest
of the input stream into the output file by a loop of
        fgets()
        check for cutmarks
        fprintf()
which will trash anything that contains nulls, and may not do
the right thing for newlines either, though it won't bother high-bits.
I suppose it wouldn't be too hard to write a getchar/putchar loop
that checks for cutmarks while transferring data safely
(this would be easier if cutmark behaviour includes outputting the cutmark.)
However, the remailer uses the native mail program (e.g. sendmail)
to forward the mail, so if your sendmail trashes binaries,
or does annoying vestigial things like changing "From " to ">From "
at the beginnings of lines, it'll still lose.

You're probably right, for today's factoring techniques.
For a key you're only planning to use for the next couple of years,
you can pretty much ignore strong primes, unless you're stuck with
512-bit keys, in which case you need to glean any crumbs you can.
But for a value that needs to last a long time, such as a Diffie-Hellman modulus that's going to be a default value in a standard,
and which you're only going to generate once anyway, it makes sense
to generate a strong prime in case factoring methods that are
affected by it become popular again in the future.  It also makes sense
to turn loose a bunch of people using different primality tests
just in case somebody gets lucky (e.g. crank the test long enough that
the probability of non-primality is 10**-9 or 10**-12 instead of just 10**-6.

secret-key-ring server to make it easier to download them

This is, of course, semi-dangerous, for a couple of reasons
1) Limiting access to your secret keyring file reduces the probability of a brute-force cracker attack against your keyring - if your password is "foo", then anybody who has your keyring can
probably find that out quickly if they hack a pgp-keyring-cracker.
2) Your keyring has, in cleartext, the identities of the different
keys on it.  If you only use one id, and it's well-known, that doesn't
expose you particularly, but if you're using multiple nyms,
anyone who has your file can connect them by just looking at the
printable parts of the file.
However, assuming you've decided to do it anyway :-), what are your options?
You could use a networked file system such as NFS or Netware or the
Evil Microsoft NETBIOS-based filesystems, and take advantage of their
protections.  Since they don't ship encrypted data, any eavesdropper can
find them anyway, but they won't be able to just grab the file off the net.
You'd be better off, however, using a secure web server, like Apache-SSL,
and only providing https: access to the page plus passwords plus address-based restrictions to try to make it accessible only to you
and not eavesdroppable.  Also, you can encrypt the copy of the secret
keyring you distribute using a secret key you can remember.
But don't do it :-)

There are some problems with this method - it requires several exchanges, so it's awkward to use for email (though you can do it.)
Also, it does expose the signed keyparts, which reveals the public

Another is that National Leaders have a tacit understanding between

If you break the taboo, you're implicitly inviting everyone else

If the US _had_ really wanted to assassinate Saddam, they could have

killed 200,000 other Iraqis, including civilians, draftees, and a
few tens of thousands of real soldiers.
I think a more realistic danger is that the government will use it

This leads to that kind of symptom - the server doesn't quite realize

Start by assuming it's a computer problem, then try attributing stupidity,

which ISPs are looking for the addresses of which second-level domains.
This isn't very informative when somebody at aol.com wants an address of
compuserve.com (which will get cached at aol.com's DNS server anyway),
but tells them a lot more when small-isp.com asks for skeeve.net's address,
especially when they know which Usual Suspects are at small-isp.com .
3) Added-paranoia mode, for people who believed 2) :-)
Suppose you've got a vanity domain name, like skeeve.net, and
they really want to track you.  So they hack the data in the .net
nameserver to respond to requests for skeeve.net with
198.81.129.94, which tells you that  is 191.127.0.42,
which runs an http server that fetches the information from
203.28.52.181 that you're asking for and an SMTP relay hack that
forwards the mail while keeping copies for itself.  (Even if you're running SSL encrypted, it can probably still play active eavesdropper, knowing who's
talking to 203.28.52.181, though it can't read the encrypted packets.
If SSL is currently including IP addresses in the encrypted information
to reduce spoofing, it can still at least hose the conversation.)
Your ISP will cache this, so the next time somebody wants to talk to
skeeve.net, it'll take care of that for them.
This really doesn't work well for targets on aol.com, compuserve.com, prodigy.com, ix.netcom.com, worldnet.att.net, and uunet.net
that are a bit big to filter all the traffic for, of course,
but it catches most of the interesting people.
4) If they _do_ participate in the Network Access Points
(e.g. fnords.net, on one of the Metropolitan Area Exchange
FDDI rings, is really a CIA plant) they could probably sniff packets
for people they don't have peering arrangements with.
If you don't see the fnords, they won't eat your packets.
If you do see the fnords, they will eat your packets, so you won't see them.
This doesn't work as well for switch-based NAPs such as
Big Hairy Routers or ATM switches, but ATM Virtual Circuits
have fnords all over them anyway; that's why there are _5_ bytes in the header.

People have been imposing their will on others in Ireland for 800 years,
and killing off the more prominent members of the opposition has been
a long-term policy of the thugs who've been doing it.  Today there are
at least three competing gangs of thugs trying to impose their will on
others by force.   The Protestants are afraid that the Catholic majority
on the island will enforce their rule on them, and the Catholics in the north
are afraid that the Protestants will enforce their rule on them,
both with good reason as near as I can tell.  At least a few years ago,
the IRA were spouting Marxist rhetoric and wanted to impose their
Marxist thuggery on the whole island.  The Queen's Empire's army
understands AP better than the IRA does - they know the IRA's
happy to kill Imperial soldiers who wander around unprotected.
On the other hand, the IRA are a bunch of murdering thugs who
blow up pubs and non-combatants as well as targeting soldiers.
Some of the pro-Saxon Orangeheads do the same, of course,
though most of them mainly like to have parades in Catholic
neighborhoods to say "Nyahh, nyahh, we still rule you peons."
The atrocities that the IRA and Brits commit against each other
are both unsupportable, and lead to more conflict rather than peace,
but neither side has the high moral ground to complain about it. But AP is great - adding more violence to Ireland is just the thing
they need........
One of the strong negatives of AP is that it leads to reverse AP -
if you don't know _which_ Hatfield killed the latest McCoy, you might as well just shoot one or two Hatfield Boys at random.  If you kill off GrandDaddy Hatfield, there's nobody to say "OK, let's stop shooting each other"; instead there's a bunch of angry grandkids, and uncles, _all_ of whom have the
authority to say "Let's go kill the McCoy bastards who did this!"
The protocols may work when there's one hierarchical target -
they don't work with two.  Hammurabi's law about "An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth" was a _limitation_ on the amount of vengeance
you were allowed to take, not a minimum required vengeance.
Libertarians have varying opinions about government; some of us
are anarchists, while some are minarchists.  Most of us figure that
once we've gotten rid of the first 90% of government, we can haggle about the rest of it then, in a much freer society,
where people will have different perspectives on what stupid and obnoxious
things they want the government to stop doing next.  And if the
well-intentioned-but-misguided minarchists prevail, it'll still be
far better than today :-)
Assassins, on the other hand, are generally on power trips -
I don't see that replacing power-tripping wholesale murderers
with lots of power-tripping retail murderers is really a good thing.

if you've got to synthesize lots of different molecules

Unlike quantum computing, it doesn't change the exponentiality
of the problems it's solving, it just multiplies the computing
capability by a very big constant, and it does parallelize cleanly.
The engineering is tricky, but I find it more believable than
practical high-precision quantum computers.
And if the DNA computer doesn't work, you can always recycle
your lab to synthesize large quantities of recreational pharamceuticals

It was interesting hearing Limbaugh's mixed feelings about it;

GOST requires you to set some parameters, I think S-boxes,

Jim Bidzos of RSA did a contractual deal with NTT, who have produced
a chip with RSA and Triple-DES implemented on it.  I'm not sure the
details of the deal, but essentially it's a license to use the patented RSA technology.  It's not that it's better or worse than PGP;
it's hardware implementations of some of the building blocks PGP uses.
The real win of PGP was taking the pieces (RSA public key key-distribution
and signatures, hashing, and symmetric crypto (DES,Bass-O-Matic,IDEA)),
putting them together into one relatively usable package, and distributing it.
The Web Of Trust that you build out of the RSA signatures is also a win,
since it lets you build non-hierarchical key distribution, which is
especially valuable for non-government-approved lefties :-) as well
as letting you build hierarchical military-style approval if you want.
But that's all applications of the core technologies - NTT is providing
the core pieces that you can build that sort of thing out of.
The NTT deal means that non-US manufacturers can build crypto-phones,
crypto-faxes, crypto-wide-area-network-muxes, etc., without annoying
US local ordinances interfering.  If they use it widely, and a flood
of such products hit the US, ITAR becomes effectively dead, which may

@_subject: Making Remailers Widespread 
I've been thinking about how to make one-way remailers a widespread commodity, rather than the novelty item they are today.
Doing two-way remailers would be better, but that's still a hard problem,
and I don't want to widely deploy shoddy two-way-remailers.
Suppose we add form-based remailer support to a popular SSL-equipped
HTTP server, such as Apache-SSL, by putting remailer.pl and a remailer form in the default setup, which would deploy hundreds of remailers
with minimal effort.  What would we have to do to make it work well,
rather than turn into a public relations disaster and spam explosion?
- The remailer script would have to add disclaimers at the beginning
and/or end of the message reminding readers that the message is
anonymous, and to contact the remailer cabal rather than the postmaster.
- Blocking becomes a big problem - it's annoying enough now,
when there are a small number of remailers with hard-working operators;
we'd need some sort of automated blocking support to make it
usable by relatively non-involved operators
- A centralized block list (e.g. which all of the form-based remailers could load and reference would
allow non-picky operators not to have to handle it themselves
- Implementing the blocking list as a web form for people who
want to be blocked would make it relatively painless to use;
remailer-operators wouldn't have to transcribe email from the
remailer-operators list to use it, which helps with other problems.
- Of course, once anybody can fill out their name and ask to be
blocked, it's possible for spoofers to block people who don't want to be.
One approach for preventing this is to implement a three-way handshake         - user fills out form, form mails back blocking notice with cookie,                 user returns cookie to complete blocking
        - this is a bit messier for mailing lists, but we can ignore...
        - special-case for "postmaster", who may want to block
                all of foo.domain instead of just postmaster
        - special-special-case for postmasters of big sites, e.g. aol, netcom,
                who we may want to ignore?
- A sender-blocking list is harder, and may still take human attention
- remailer chaining - allow user to put in another Apache-remailer site
        so we don't have to limit the chaining to known short list of sites.
        The remailer.pl can send an https foo.bar.com remailer.pl PUT
- The remailer form can probably just have field for second site, if empty
don't use.
        I suppose remailer.pl could also automagically add that in when it
Technical question:
- How do we initiate an http or https PUT from a script?
        I assume there's probably some perl add-in for posting http/https?
        Is there a command-line-shell interface that can fetch URLs?

Essentially the A/S works by having the publicly-readable signal

However, the fuzz _is_ consistent - if you've got two nearby points,
and you really know where one of them is, you can correct for it,
and get better accuracy even than the full GPS with A/S turned off.
The approach the Feds are taking to prevent competition from real
differential GPS is to field a differential GPS system of their own,
located at/near airports (who are the real people who want D-GPS,
so they can do things like better instrumented or automated landings.)
This way, nobody's got much financial incentive to deploy D-GPS
correction transmitters of their own, and manufacturers have an incentive
to deploy equipment tuned to the FAA's correction transmitters,
so they can still turn them off if they want to.  Except for takeoff/landing, airplanes don't much need differential GPS;
you shouldn't be flying within a hundred meters of other planes anyway,

@_subject: Technical difficulties with AP [AP NOISE] 
Aside from details like dead bodies, vendettas, and government suppression,
there are technical complications with Assassination Politics
that make it more than the simple job Jim Bell is imagining.
Some of them provide ways to defend against AP, and turn it into more like
Extortion Politics.
        [Do I _really_ want to bring up more discussion of AP?
        Not sure, but if it's clear that it won't work very well,
        it'll be less likely for the government media to freak about :-)]
Let's look at the critical part of the problem - paying the assassin.
The model we've generally been using is that the players are the
victim, the escrow agent who manages the system, an enthusiastic public,
and the assassin or assassins who are competing for the jackpot.
I can see three approaches to identifying the correct payee:
1) Payee provides physical evidence to the escrow agent -         the traditional approach doesn't work here: since the
        escrow agent is anonymous, so you can't mail him the
        victim's wallet or finger with well-known fingerprint or whatever.
2) Assassin leaves physical evidence at the scene which the news media
        would be likely to report, which payee confirms with escrow
        agent, presumably committing in advance (e.g. after the event,
        the payee sends a key which allows the escrow agent to decode
        the encrypted message that said "I'm leaving a note on the body
        saying 'Jacques De Molay is Avenged - Assassin's Guild Member         Works fine for the first couple of assassinations, but after a while
        the police will catch on and stop revealing kinky details to the media.
3) The main solution has been the gambling deal -         it's just a lottery on the date of death of the victim, which presumably
        the payee will win because he knows when the assassin will strike.
        For a lottery to be effective, prospective assassins need to
        be able to determine how much the jackpot is and who the victim is,
        so they can place their bets and be the closest winner.
        But the prospective victim can also play, individually or as part
        of an insurance pool (which is especially valuable for victims like
        "the first IRS agent to be assassinated".)  Obviously you don't want
        to just bid up the price on your own head, so it needs to be accompanied
        by publicity that the IRS Agents' Benevolent Association is placing
        a large number of small bets every day to maximize the chances that
        _they_ will collect the money rather than the assassins.
        If the times that the bets are for are published, you can beat this,
        but you also invite speculators to be small bets just before and after
        your bets, so it becomes a mishmash and perhaps a race condition.
        If the times aren't published, the assassin can make lots of bets
        surrounding the planned date of the hit, which is also a warning
        to the prospective victim to be careful if the bets on his demise
        start increasing rapidly.
        This does make the AP lottery somewhat of an extortion deal -         by advertising that someone is a target, you're forcing them to
        continually make lots of bets.  But if they've got any way of tracing
        money, even partially, it'll help them find the escrow agent,
        who can then be targeted for justice of one sort or another.
        You're also forcing the assassin to make lots of bets, though in
        a jackpot system the successful payee will recover most of it.
        To some extent the defense can be fought if the escrow agent
        wants to establish a minimum bet, say $100, which an assassin
        can afford to make a few of for the targeted day, but the
        victim can't keep paying too much.  This also reduces the
        since of the potential better pool, and therefore reduces
        the jackpot and the attractiveness of the job to the assassin.
        Lots of people might be willing to spend $5 to contribute;
        $100 bets are much fewer, especially if there are enough
        targets to successfully overthrow a government.

@_subject: Re: Making Remailers Widespread [REMAILERS] 
There have been several good replies - thanks!
I agree, it's a problem; the return address seems to reduce abuse.
But one-way remailers can be used to simulate many of the uses of two-way,
especially with message-pool return methods (e.g. alt.anonymous.messages.)
Doing two-way remailers well is hard - most of the methods around are ok
for passive attacks, but may not resist subpoenas, rubber-hose, or crackers.
It's especially hard if you want the remailer to be a no-brainer to install
and operate, rather than one that requires expert support.
Snow's one-shot reply block method is interesting, whether you do a public-key
or secret-key approach (if you do public key, you obviously use the public
half for the part that stays at the remailer.)  It has the real advantage that
compromising the remailer doesn't give you the reply information for past or
current messages, so you can only compromise one message at a time,
which is a big win over the one-key-per-remailer reply blocks.
I think I like it.
On the other hand, there are a host of potential problems:
- Chaining is probably more difficult, at least return-chaining.
- Individual True Believer remailer operators would usually resist
cooperating with authorities to decrypt the reply block, but ad-hoc
remailer operators who are just running a remailer because they haven't
turned off the default feature that came with their Web Server
will probably reveal the key, especially for Politically Incorrect material
(definition depends on their individual politics, of course.)
- A web form interface, filled out from a web anonymizer, doesn't
give you a useful return address, so spammers can still abuse it.
- You have to decide how much persistence to use for the reply block.
One-shots are more secure, but aren't helpful for replies to web postings
or other multiple-recipient communication, but timeouts have their own problems.
Good point.  A bit tough to implement in a no-brainer out-of-the-box remailer;
you gain a bit by having the block list point to an address that's really
a round-robin DNS spinner of some sort, but that still leaves you with
Yeah.  This makes it easy to block anonymous remailer input to (say)
the cypherpunks mailing list, since _any_ mailing list user can block.
Putting a never-block list at the blocking server is a possibility,
and would require some announced policy for implementing it.
Blocking an entire domain like * is mostly bad.
Blocking an entire domain like * is fine.
Deciding the boundary between the two is, um, amusing :-)
I'd probably set it such that ISPs don't get blocked, but non-ISPs do,
though that might change if the administrator of aol.com asks five million users to submit individual blocking request.
I suppose this means there's a volume question here :-)
Having a don't-block list that individuals can subscribe to would help.
There are some spammers you'd like to stop quickly when a Spam Event is happening.  There are broken email gateways that may need blocking.
There are known abusers you might want stopped.  And there are folks like
president who can be presumed to be forgeries :-)
A sender-blocking list administered by the Remailer Cabal* would be
a reasonable default for no-brainer remailers, and obviously it
should be possible for remailer-admins to override or ignore if they want.
That's worth doing, or at least thinking about seriously.
The most interesting regular expressions are * (which you can
handle by keeping separate block lists for domains and full addresses
(or a merged list that the using remailer checks both)) and
* and user - e.g. alice
which would successfully deliver mail to alice
Perhaps the system needs to keep two hashes - hash(alice),hash(big-isp.com)
and check subsets of the domain name?  This is creeping featurism,
but it may be the right way to go to set a good precedent.
One unfortunate result of only using hashed names and not readable names is that it doesn't help the current remailer operators,
since their existing code doesn't work that way.  Keeping the file of real names encrypted and only distributing it
to the Remailer Cabal seems leaky at best :-) - I'd expect to see it
remailed to some public place just on principle.
You can easily send it to a procmail program at a web site, though,
which can take care of doing the right thing with it.
Mark M.'s pointer to netcat is especially relevant for this.
[*The existence of the Remailer Cabal, viewed by some as a shadowy subversive conspiracy, and by others as Dedicated Public Servants
has been repeatedly denied by anyone in a position to know. :-) ]

That's another good approach, though a second-string objective compared
to having full-scale terminal remailers running everywhere.
But it's clearly a strong fallback position, and might be easier to
get people to adopt and not turn off.  It does depend on the availability
of a list of working remailers with the correct feature sets,
plus adequate distribution of either PGP keys or some S/MIME-related equivalent.
One way to do that is to parse Raph's list appropriately (and check
signatures on that); another is to have some centralized (sigh) DNS server
do a round-robin distribution so that random.remailer.net picks a
random known-good remailer to deliver through, perhaps also delivering a PGP
I'd far prefer a distributed solution, but this does let people volunteer
to take heat for a little while and dispose of their remailers if they
have to.  In particular, it may be useful for winsock remailers that
are willing to connect up and be a delivery remailer when they're connected
and disconnect when they're unavailable.

@_subject: Tools for Rendering Censorship Firewalls Ineffective 
I've been trying to categorize the web censorship techniques available
to governments, such as Singapore and China's Firewall Curtains,
Germany's ISP Threats, etc.  The objective is to make information widely
and conveniently available to subjects of the censoring country
by building tools that will provide multiple paths to data that
are easy to find and hard to block because they're too pervasive.
I'm assuming that email is difficult to block, in-country public websites are blockable (through business licenses, lawsuits, rubber-hoses, or confiscation), in-country private websites are difficult to block but not very relevant, authors can afford and post to foreign web sites without effective blocking, and that the real "threat" to the government is foreign websites making banned information conveniently available to its subjects. I'm also assuming that the government can use humans to discover a moderate
quantity of banned info, but that blocking will mostly be done by bots rather
than human readers.  In particular, I'm ignoring the approach of
in-country hidden websites, since it's too vulnerable in some countries,
and focussing on the web rather than email because it's mass-market and
easier to use, and email is harder to stop, especially given crypto and
Notation: "Attack" is the Censors trying to stop data; "defend" and "evade"
are the Good Guys trying to not get censored.
The obvious techniques I can see include
1) Filter on IP address (e.g. German attack on XS4ALL)
2) Filter on DNS Name
3) Filter on Patterns in URL
4) Filter on Patterns in PUT/GET Requests
5) Filter on Patterns in Response.
6) Traffic Analysis on reading patterns
Defenses -
The most important defenses to these attacks depend on ubiquity and volume -
they can block one or two of anything, they might be able to block a thousand,
and it's not possible to block millions of things everywhere.
So building bridges between systems and increasing multiplicity is a win.
1) It's easy to evade the crude version of this attack - use rolling IP
addresses, and use DNS to publish the new ones.  For the German model,
where the government has to tell the ISPs who to block, this wins.
They can counter by blocking your whole IP network, not just a single machine, which you can counter by hopping IP networks as well as hosts,
though that's more trouble (and blocking routes is probably easier
than blocking hosts, since you do it at the routers, and harder to
get people to turn back on.)  They can also enforce boycotts on the ISP,
as they did with XS4ALL - blocking most of the traffic to a site
can affect its other traffic enough to be economically annoying.
The attackers can counter by also tracking the address with a bot -
if you change addresses hourly, they can change blocking addresses hourly,
which may workable for somewhere high-tech like Singapore or very focussed
like China, but isn't very effective for somewhere porous like Germany
that has a system of laws that move at the speed of bureaucracy.
A very effective defense against this method is to deploy relay servers,
either anonymizers or simple non-anonymizing cgi scripts that take URLs like
     and fetch and return the real URL (perhaps modifying any URLs in it
to connect through the relay.)  This works if there are lots of easy-to-find
relay servers.  An obvious approach would be to package the relay program with
Apache or other popular web server, so anybody who didn't bother turning it off
would have a relay named "relay.pl"; the attackers can't realistically block
everybody who's got one.
Another effective defense is to use web servers that gateway to AFS (Andrew File System) or other distributed file systems.  This lets         /stanford.edu/censored-mirrors/banned.html
be accessible from any site supporting AFS, such as
        This has the great advantage that AFS sites are usually at
major universities, which are important enough that lots of people
would complain if you blocked them.
This works better if there's an easy way to insert things into
the AFS tree - volunteers are fine, but if there are servers that
can automatically import material it becomes easier, either by
copying or by various kinds of indirection.  (On the other hand,
if you allow automated import, attackers can turn your site
into the Child Pornography NarcoTerrorist Bomb Info Mart and ban you...)
Do the major web crawlers index AFS?  Or do the sites use robots.txt
to prevent multiple crawls, e.g. by only allowing searching on the
local file systems and not on the remote ones?
2) Filtering on DNS names is an attack that proxy servers can use -
the HTTP spec [RFC1945] says that requests to proxies need to send
an Absolute URI (method://machine[:port][abs_path]) rather than
just the absolute path (/etc.), so the proxy servers can filter on DNS names,
defeating the rolling-IP-address defense.  Doesn't stop relays.
Non-proxy attacks don't have access to this method.  However, governments that use full-scale firewalls and not just http proxies can also restrict what DNS queries the National DNS Servers will pass.
How to defend against it for non-proxy attackers?  One way is to make it
easy to find the IP address of a server with banned material -
web indexers can find everything, so putting the IP form of the URL in a file that the popular indexers, along with useful keywords, is one way to make sure you get found.  Another would be to deploy
DNS servers widely (done:-) and maybe form-based interfaces
for users that will run Dig or whatever.  3) Filtering on patterns in URLs - as with DNS filters, a proxy server
run by an attacker can block access based on patterns in the URL,
such as relay.pl.  This makes it tougher to use relays as a defense,
because they either need to have different names on different machines
(harder for users to find and for administrators to implement without
having to pay attention), or else to not need a name (either modify
the protocols or at least the servers so that
        gets handled properly.)  The latter is doable, but probably
requires more administrator support?  Pattern matching on URLs can make it easier to attack AFS -
you don't need to kill the whole AFS tree, just the banned parts.
Pattern matching on URLs already starts to have heavy volume issues -
can a proxy server take the extra time to search an ever-larger
banned list on every web hit?  Having used overloaded proxy servers
at work (:-), I'd expect the population to start acting like
disgruntled postal workers if the mandatory national firewall
is underpowered.  On the other hand, I suppose a government could
partially solve scale problems by requiring a license fee for
use of the proxy server; a few bucks per user could pay for
increasing numbers of servers as well as tracking who's reading what.
4) Filter on Patterns in PUT/GET Requests
As a defense against blocking URLs by patterns, defenders can
send requests as message-body in PUT/GET requests; this is also
useful for submitting banned material to cooperative sites.
Attackers can filter on this material, though they can't easily filter out
SSL or S-HTTP requests by content, depending on how much the protocols
pass material end-to-end rather than link-by-link where the proxy
can see it.
5) Filter on Patterns in Responses.
Similarly, attackers could just grep for banned material in HTTP responses,
though SSL/S-HTTP both interfere with this.  Defenders can also structure
banned writing in ways that don't trigger patterns easily (e.g. don't
refer to Lee Kwan Yew, just refer to That Bum or Mr. Big, etc.)
Filtering on picture content is obviously difficult, so including
text in graphics can help prevent attacks.  In general, I'd expect
filtering attacks to be extremely susceptible to volume.
On the other hand, attackers don't have to filter in real-time;
they could scan material as a background activity, and go arrest
the people who have received contraband after the fact,
or just block their National Firewall Passports if they're reading
too much.  In general, this attack is probably more useful for
overall study of what their subjects are reading than for real-time.
6) Traffic Analysis - who's reading what?  Where?  Who's reading a
lot of contraband?  What's popular foreign material?  Which of
the attackers' subjects are possible fellow travellers, based on
what they're reading?  This kind of material is useful for marketing
as well as for identifying malcontents - businesses aren't always
pro-privacy either, though they want their own secrets kept secret.
Many of the attacks above can work as after-the-fact analysis
more effectively than they can as real-time blocking, and volume
is less of a problem for crunching a sample of firewall logs
than for active blocking; this may be the hardest attack to counter,
though it's repression rather than censorship.  If you can't police
everybody, you can at least encourage the policeman in everybody's head.

Neither Matt Blaze nor Ross Anderson are particularly on the

to time-travel back to Last Monday :-)  One difference between
snake oil salesmen and mathematical cryptographers is that
the latter talk about what they're doing, why it's as strong
as it is, and how it relates back to other known hard problems
or attack techniques.  If this is sufficiently hard, cool.
Most of the symmetric-key attacks these days are based on being
sufficiently messy to be hard to attack, and on resisting known
attacks, but there's no particular way to prove how hard they are -
you can just show that they're messier than any currently known
techniques can untangle.  On the other hand, the experience with
most public-key techniques is that it's hard to adapt NP-hard problems to crypto in ways that don't introduce special forms
that can fall apart when handled right - the knapsack problem
was a good example.  Factoring and discrete-log still appear to
be hard problems, but it would be nice to have other known-hard
public-key systems.  It would also be nice to have private-key
systems that use NP-hard problems in strong ways, especially if
it doesn't make them appallingly slow :-)

The laws of nature don't appear to provide any maximum strength,
assuming you run out of atoms to store your data before
you run out of capacity for your computer, and _you'll_ be out of
cash long before that :-)  For mathematically strong algorithms,
you can make the work a cracker has to do be exponentially larger
than the amount of work you have to do to decrypt, so you win.
Different governments have different rules, and many have no rules. Bert-Jaap Koops has a summary that (last time I looked) was at
about different governments' crypto use and export rules.
For the US, you can export cryptography software if you get permission,
and you can usually get permission if you're using up to
40-bit symmetric-key keys and 512-bit public keys,
or if you're writing software that's strictly for banking.
You usually can't get permission for stronger crypto than that,
unless you're a registered international arms dealer and are
only selling your crypto gear to Friends Of The Pentagon.
There aren't any restrictions on the strength of crypto you can
use for messages you're exporting, only on software you export.
And there are somewhat bizarre interpretations of "export",
including telling foreigners inside US borders if they're not US subjects.
Domestically, there are no restrictions on crypto you can
write and use inside the US, subject of course to the bizarre interpretations
of "domestically" that accompany "export".

@_subject: Re: Making Remailers Widespread [REMAILERS] 
Getting more complex, but it might be workable.
You obviously can't source-block a determined spammer, but you can
slow down some spam attacks, especially if they're one individual using his/her regular account.  It's no panacaea, but it helps.
Also, if you source-block based on patterns anywhere in the header,
you can catch less capable email forgers.
That'd work.  It's clunky, but there's no avoiding clunkiness
for this sort of thing, and it does preserve privacy.
postmaster is (ostensibly) guaranteed to exist.
The Internic database is an interesting alternative, but for this
I suspect postmaster is good enough.  There's also the problem
that for many domains, where smallcompany.com is virtual on an ISP,
the Internic database will generally list someone at the ISP,
who probably has no interest in the issue, rather than someone
responsible for making decisions about smallcompany.com
For destination blocking, I agree that users should be able to block their own stuff as automagically as possible.
For source blocking, most of the need is for spams and abusers
that have been tracked down (or identify themselves in their postings),
and that takes human thought.  In particular, spammers are unlikely
to block themselves from the remailers (:-), but forgers may try to block
legitimate users.
Interesting.  I suspect the state of the art would be to collect
the bits with a disclaimer that there isn't any code to interpret them :-),
but it does let you build a blocking database that's usable as capabilities
Any suggestions for flags besides block/allow one-way, block/allow two-way,
and max-size?  I'm thinking of doing a remailer that instead of sending
you a message, it sends you a retrieval cookie and lets you send it back
to collect the message; blocking that would be another flag.
The other kind of blocking that needs adding is blocking by
words in message bodies - the spammer that caused me to shut down
my remailer and not bring it back up was posting hate messages
with somebody else's name and email signed at the bottom.  It only took one or two to generate a flood of flames to the victim,
and my current remailer couldn't block any followups.
Also, since the spammer wasn't generating the flames himself,
his spam slipped under the remailer's spam counter, just as
hipcrime's did.  This sort of blocking also lets you block
things like the hipcrime spam and MAKE MONEY FAST.
But it's a much more sensitive problem - anybody who can add things
to the body-checking list can start doing real censorship,
and it's probably best to leave that to individual operators to block,
or at least to turn on by hand rather than default.

Hip Hip Hooray!  Clinton will finally let us use _some_
20+year-old encryption code, which has been known to be relatively
weak for 15 years, as long as we give them all our keys!  What a guy!
I assume he's partly doing this to make a big "See, I'm in favor
of high-tech trade and crime-fighting" push in time for the election,
and unlike RC4/40, cracking DES on general-purpose processors
_is_ a big enough job that probably can't do a distributed crack
in two weeks.  But still, get real - the NBS/NIST kept recertifying DES
every 5 years only because it was in widespread use and there weren't
good fast alternatives for the first couple of years (except triple-DES,
which on the computers of the time was annoyingly slow.)  There were far more powerful systems like Diffie-Hellman and later RSA that were too slow for general use and are now fairly practical,
but they're not letting us use them....

56 bits + GAK does generally mean DES/GAK, though RC4/56/GAK is also possible.
One "56-bit" protocol that might be allowable under the new rules is
"something strong with all but 56 key bits revealed", e.g. RC4/128
with 72 bits salt revealed (like the RC4/128 with 88 bits salt revealed that
Netscape uses, or 3-DES with 112 bits salt revealed), which would be substantially stronger against cracking than raw 56-bit DES.  A big advantage is that it makes pre-computation of lists less useful,
since two cyphertexts with the same 56-bit key might be different in the
top N-56 bits of key, and the key schedules are less reusable.
The 3DES version, for instance, also gains because some of the big
DES hooks that let you scrounge a few bits don't work.

If your lobbyists lose and you have to register your gun, it still works.
If your lobbyists lose and you have to register your crypto keys, you lose;
that means the government or anybody who can get your keys can crack your stuff.
If your lobbyists lose and you have to get permission to make guns,
most of the interesting guns can still be made.  If your lobbyists lose and you have to get permission to write crypto,
many of the interesting crypto applications won't get written -
we not only depend on the free flow of ideas, but on people doing applications

Registered International Arms Dealers, don't want to wait the months
that such registration takes for background checks, and don't want to
give up all the privacy involved just so they can write a bug report
for somebody else's code or suggest an improvement.
Face it, as much as the Gun Lobby has slowed down the growth of anti-gun laws,
they've still lost step by step, law by law, against a government that's
succeeded in scaring the public about threats to public safety and
in convincing the public that only the military needs strong weapons
and that registering everyday-use weapons is just fine.
I support much of what they do, and I'd be happy if they supported us,
and it's probably easier to get their support on crypto than drug rights,
but we can't _depend_ on it.
Also, getting public support for crypto is a hearts-and-minds deal;
the press generally dislikes guns, and generally approves of free speech,
and press support is important - especially since the press's default behaviour
is to believe government press reports about crypto-narco-porno-terrorists
using assault remailers.

In particular, it's N>>20 years old, the NBS originally certified it for
five years, and kept recertifying it primarily because triple-DES was
too slow on the popular bank computers of the time (e.g. cash machines
and then PCs), and hardware implementations of 56-bit DES would need
to be replaced if the algorithm were decertified.  Public-key encryption was developed a few years after DES,
with a solid mathematical background that lets it remain secure today.
It's far more secure than DES but far slower, so it's only been practical
the last few years.   Newer encryption technology which is several times faster and much stronger than DES has been developed over the last decade.
"Key Recovery" is the latest sleazy meme from the Government.
The only difference from so-called "Key Escrow" is that it's deliberately
obscure about who gets to keep your master keys, while "Escrow" implies
that it's definitely somebody else besides you.

@_subject: Re: picture encryption 
There are several such programs.  The general term is "Steganography",
which means "hidden writing", so you'll see programs with names like
stego, jsteg, mandelsteg, etc.  Look in the usual archive locations
such as ftp.ox.ac.uk and ftp.funet.fi.  Also, for Romana Machado's
stego programs, look at her home page on It's not an _excellent_ alternative, but if it's all you can get,
it's all you can get.  It helps to use encryption algorithms that
don't have special forms, e.g. don't begin with "----- BEGIN PGP"
or other easy-to-spot headers, don't limit their output to printable ASCII,
and (tougher) don't have other subtleties such as the statistical
properties of RSA keys or checksums that can be tested without decrypting.
There's been a lot of discussion on the subject here, and there are
some stealth-PGP versions that obscure PGP's form.
One difficulty with stego'd encrypted data is that it's tough to use
it for applications like encrypting voice between your cellphone and
the cellphone company, since _they_ won't be implementing it.
One suggested place to stash encrypted data is in the low bits
of compressed voice on an internet phone product.  It's difficult -
you need to pick a voice compression algorithm that has room to
substitute bits without messing up the voice quality a lot,
which means you need to work closely with the compression algorithm.
For 64kbps PCM, this is easy (some of the T1 standards already do this
to send signalling bits, which is why data is often limited to 56kbps.)
ADPCM and Delta Modulation can probably handle it fairly well, though
they're generally used only down to speeds of 16 kbps.  Tighter compression
algorithms have less room for noise, are much more sophisticated,
require much more computation, and are probably a lot tougher to use,
but they're where most of the internet phone products are.
And then there are applications like CU-SeeMe (low-speed video conferencing)
which are generally flaky enough that you could toss in the occasional
stego frame and blame it on your cheapo camera or the overloaded reflector :-)

As far as the technical issue, can you use digital signal processing
to insert/delete the features that the VSE is looking for?
Sure, if you know what the VSE product is looking for.
(And you can crank up the bass while you're at it.)
Doesn't matter if you call it microtremors, it's a characteristic
well-defined enough that an $89.95 retail hardware device can detect,
so it's a characteristic you've got a not-terribly-complex model for.
If all the popular VSEs use the same algorithm, or if you know what
brand the TV Networks were convinced to use, you're fine.
(If you don't know, that makes it tougher, but you can experiment....)
Or you can distribute a cheap software-based VSE program, with hooks that
let you feed it "Truth" or "Lying" overrides :-)
I've never seen the TV networks use handwriting analysis to spice up
their news reporting either, and the only "news" shows I've only seen mention people's astrological signs were the Entertainment-Tonight types.
(I'd rate VSE as slightly more scientific than graphology, and both of them
somewhat above palm-reading and astrology, and a bit below polygraphs.*)
They get more market asking what kind of underwear the candidates wear.
Besides, what would they do with it - subtitles "He's Lying" or
"He Seems To _Believe_ This Nonsense?" or "He Doesn't Really Care What The Teleprompter's Telling Him To Say"?  You'd need to leave at least
one of them on during the whole Bipartisan Establishment Debate**,
and you don't need any piece of hokey machinery to If they actually _wanted_ to make the shows more interesting, the networks
could have reporters ask the candidates real questions.  But they
wouldn't get invited back next election....  And if they ask questions like
"How could you possibly expect us to believe _that_, Mr. President?"***,
they'd get thrown out immediately.
[*VSE and Graphology have some chance of a causal basis, though
polygraphs have the extra advantage that the people administering them
get to intimidate the victim while doing the test, which is more likely
to get results than running VSE on a speech somebody's practiced and
is reading off a teleprompter, even if interpretation of both weren't
pretty much subjective anyway.]

At 04:28 PM 10/13/96 -0400, "Michael Froomkin - U.Miami School of Law"
Looks like a really nice paper on anonymity issues; at 485K, it'll take
a little while to read :-)
The fundamental difficulty in this problem is that you need some demonstrable proof of uniqueness for human users; if you don't have that,
you can't transform it into a unique-but-anonymous identity.*
The issues are similar to privacy-protecting voter registration problems.
Brands's protocol starts with the user going to the bank with proof of ID,
and getting a numerical ID which can be blinded and signed.
It's a nice approach; you can do cruder approaches by hashing your
universal-citizen-unit-ID-number or whatever, but that can be
by feeding all the possible ID numbers through the hash.
For some applications, mapping back to a unique human isn't necessary;
if you do something like map back to a bank account which has a high
minimum balance for setup, this discourages the type of users who
don't want to spend $100 just to send spam.
Blinding a Verisign signature isn't enough, though - they support
personna certificates without proof of identity.
Froomkin also points out a class of attacks that can allow abusers to get around
Brands's protocol - a group of users get together and abuse one ID till it gets
busted, then abuse the next, etc., until they're all burned.  Or you hire
a bum off the street to get an account for you.  Or whatever.
[ * There are non-universal-identifier methods for preventing double-use.
Voter registration in many places just depends on identification and
affidavit, and is often abused (e.g. Chicago graveyard voters and
Nevada absentee ballots), but usually not massively abused.
Some third-world countries don't even require registration or literacy - they dip your thumb in ink after you vote, using a kind of ink that
won't come off for a couple of days.  Attacks against this protocol
include better solvents :-) ]

There are lots of copyright notices in PGP.  If you're trying to sell
PGP-derived code in a country that's part of the Berne Copyright Convention

it may apply.  But you can read it.
Copyright is more widely accepted internationally than patents on
mathematical algorithms, and the RSA patent in particular is not valid in most of the world because it was disclosed to the public before
the patent was applied for (to avoid American government tricks that
let the military classify and essentially confiscate processes that

I haven't seen the technical papers behind the postings you've made
to the net, but the overall approach sounds very similar to "Clipper II",
the Software Key Encryption work that the TIS people (Steve Walker?) and
Dorothy Denning were touting a year or so ago.  It wasn't in your references,
and it's clearly close enough to be worth your attention.  The design was
interesting -
it chose a set of public and symmetric key encryption that allows the recipient
to validate the sessionkey-encrypted-to-key-copy-holder*.
A not-highly-technical description of the TIS CKE Commercial Key Escrow
system is at particularly present9b.html.  It's worth reading for the appalling graphics
alone :-)  I don't seem to have a copy of the technical description anywhere.
A major capability that was missing from Walker's SKE work is the ability
to split the copied* key into two or more parts, all of which are need to
recover the session key, while making it possible to validate that the
pieces do add up to the session key.  (This was also missing from the Clipper
chip in hardware, which pretended to do it in the master key setting process.) Can you extend the approaches you're using to allow an outside party,
or at least the recipient, to validate that the two parts of the copied key
contain the complete session key? [* I'm using the terms "copied key" and "Key copy holder" to refer to the
copy of the key that you're giving to some third party and the third party.
The term "escrow" is generally not applicable to the applications that
transmit a copy of the key to some third party, and the technologies
involved don't specify, communicate, or enforce conditions for access.
TIS's CKE does at least cart around a 32-bit user-defined string for specifying
recovery conditions, but there's not technical enforcement.  ]

I'd start by looking at the existing remailers, and thinking about the
problems they're trying to solve and the service objectives they have.
Mixmaster code is easy to find, and I've got my own modified ghio2 somewhere
under my web page (idiom.com/~wcs/remailer, probably).  Freedom remailer is another Type 1.  Nymservers are trying to solve a different, and harder,
Writing a remailer that solves a slightly different problem than the others
is a good thing to do.  For instance, a remailer that's useful at work,
such as one that decrypts PGP mail and forwards it inside the domain,
or one that only sends mail to the suggestion box account,
could gain acceptance and help add respectability for remailers.
I don't remember if code for the Winsock remailer is available, but it
works by fetching mail from a POP3 server and remailing it out SMTP servers.
Also, you could benefit from feedback from people who used to run remailers
and have switched to other code or quit.  The usual problem is abuse,
whether it's spam posted to the net, mailbombing victims, or forging
from victims to lists/newsgroups that will generate flames in response.
Any blocking code you can write is good - you definitely need to be able
to block by source, destination, and Subject:, and grepping message bodies
may help.
Limiting source and destination to pre-approved lists is also a good feature.
Good code for auto-detecting attacks would help, e.g. shutting down
or blocking if you get more than N messages for a given source or destination in a given time period, with a tolerable user interface
for the administrator.
You also need to integrate with encryption - PGP is the obvious choice
(it'll be _so_ much easier when PGP 3.0 comes out, as we've been saying
for the last couple of years :-) but S/MIME or SSL may also be good.
I'd recommend having the default behaviour be to refuse non-encrypted mail -
otherwise, any eavesdropper can compromise your system.

I've seen 512-bits as the usual number, but the session key

They probably wouldn't approve 512-bit keys for encrypting

Cylink may have permission to use 1024 bits in some specific

Padgett's response on coderpunks wasn't really relevant - the section he was quoting was for authorization-protecting

As Andrew says, yeah, you can do it.  Chaum's Digicash is currently

Chaum's worried about this kind of problem.  But Chaum's original

adapt the payee-non-anonymous implementations to get that back
(though you'll have to write your own application code to do some of it.)
In some implementations it's sometimes easier to be payee-anonymous
if you're willing to take the risk of double-spending (i.e. trust the
payer not to double-spend the money before you can take it to
the cambio to trade it for unmarked money.)
And, yes, there are all kinds of scary applications for it,
such as Blackmail, extortion, ransom for kidnappers (which breaks the
main connection that police have with those kidnappers who really _do_
want to collect the money and return the victim alive),
and paying assassins (who have less risky payoff problems.)
It also has many non-scary but politically incorrect applications,
such as making change and trading foreign currency (aka money-laundering),
paying for politically incorrect recreational substances,
bribing politicians to do things they shouldn't, bribing government employees to do things they should but aren't, getting paid for work without the inconvenience of taxation, etc.

My experience with CU-SeeMe has been that it loses
huge quantities of data, though that's partly because
I've only used it over 14.4 modem, which isn't really
fast enough.  If the data formats are documented,
it wouldn't be hard to add a few frames of "pictures"
every second or ten that are designed to get sidetracked.
CU-SeeMe can talk one-to-one, but is generally used through
"reflectors", which are conference bridges.
One technique is to stego-equip both the client and
reflector; a more generally useful but harder method would
be to see what you could get to pass through a reflector
between two stego clients.
Motion pictures in general give you a lot of slack;
not only do they have high data rates from uncheckable sources,
but you can hide data in ways you correct later,
e.g. for Frame1 ... Frame2 ... Frame3, where the values for a given pixel change between Frame1 and Frame3,
you can encode some bits by picking whether the change happened
between Frame1 and Frame2 or Frame2 and Frame3, and your output
is perfectly valid video, readable by anybody, only a bit fuzzier
than it might have been from that cheap $89 camera you're using
in bad lighting with the ceiling fan going in the background.
Stego in innocuous-looking data is another approach.
Send those spreadsheets of traffic data or SNMP stats
or daily sales of products from your supermarket or whatever!
I've been wondering about _un_sophisticated stego,
for cases where you're trying to slip below the radar
of simple bots or dumber eavesdropping thugs.  For instance,
you could send that DOS executable .exe or animated GIF
which really _does_ expand into the cover-traffic file or generate the annoying flaming background for your web page,
but which also drags along a bunch of stegobits that
the executable thinks are just data it's ignoring or the
GIF thinks is past the last frame.
Then there are pictures which have inherently high entropy,
so you can get away with a lot more stego - like the
animated cloud picture movie you interpolated from the
weather satellite photos, or the photo of the wheelbarrow of sawdust.

I haven't read all of Usenet in 10+ years :-)  But it keeps growing,
and if you're trying to piggyback anonymous messages on it, then it's great
to have VOLUME, VOLUME, VOLUME, as the talk.bizarre folks put it.
On the other hand, there are technical difficulties with using the
current modes of Usenet for real applications, and volume may make it worse.
Usenet used to work by flooding - every message goes to every machine,
so it's not suspicious your machine receives an Anonymous Message.
Most machines had multiple users (Unix, after all), and didn't log who
accessed what files in the news spool (which you could do directly
as well as through your newsreader.)
Now, however, most users use NNTP to fetch news articles from their ISP,
and the number of machines receiving the whole Nx100MB/day flood is probably
though perhaps businesses and universities are putting up with it,
and perhaps the usage patterns are different outside North America.
Fetching material by NNTP is probably logged by many ISPs, and can also
be detected by sniffers in the places where security is weak enough for them,
which probably includes many major ISPs.  So it's easier to detect who's
reading alt.anonymous.messages, especially if some government agency
subpoenas logfiles.
No legal resistance at all, if it's done by ISPs or businesses or individuals -
only if the government tries it does it get into "protected speech" territory.
There may be market resistance, and the Internet and Usenet are fundamentally
worldwide cooperative efforts, so if the protocols support anonymity,
then participants in the nets can choose to have their systems cooperate with
or refuse to cooperate with anonymous messages, and you'll find some people
doing each one.  This may mean that small-ISP.net and xs4all.nl will permit anonymous users and aol.com, compuserve.com, and proxy.gov.sg will demand Internet Driver's Licenses to let your postings through, while nihilism.net
won't allow any non-anomymous messages.  Spontaneous order is like that.
And the US government could probably get away with sponsoring Internet
access for Real American Citizens and Green-Card Holders that requires
positive identification because you can file your tax forms over it,
as long as they don't prevent anonymous messages on _some_ part of the net.

The meaning of "Security" depends on your threat model.
Are you worried about
- having your message noticed?
- having your message decoded?
- being able to deny a possible decoding of your message?
Whether your message noticed or not depends a lot on the environment;
in some places "pure noise" is not noticeable, while in others it
really stands out (posting it to a text newsgroup, for instance.)
If you simply remove the "----- BEGIN PGP" etc. headers/trailers from a PGP
it's still got a well-defined format, including magic numbers indicating
what kind of data is in each block, block length indicators, etc.
They're both noticeable to someone who's trying to find them and
strong evidence that something is a PGP message.  That's why there's a
Stealth-PGP, though even it's not perfect.
As far as "Secure" meaning "They can't decode the message",
if you use a One-Time-Pad more than once, you can lose (viz. VENONA.)
If you use a pad that's not true random numbers, but is some simple
LFSR or LCM PRNG, or some random English-language book, it's pretty easy
for skilled cryptanalysts to decode it.
If you use something that has a well-defined structure as a pad,
and the Bad Guys notice your message and decode it, it's not credible
to say "oh, no, it's just a one-time pad, the fact that there's
one chance in 2**168 of that particular series of random numbers
matching the output of triple-DES shouldn't influence you any, Judge"....
You're gonna go to jail.    What gives you deniability with OTPs is that they _can't_ produce a meaningful message that's any more probable than any other meaningful message of the same length, so you can argue that it really says
"BUY MORE" instead of "RUN AWAY" or "ATTACK!!" and even if they guess
you're lying, they can't tell what the true message was.

Fingerprint is critical - otherwise you're subject to the "0xdeadbeef" attack.
You could also include the key itself in the signed message, if you don't

The main alternative to PGP keys is Haber&Stornetta's "Surety" notary system -
they use trees of hashes to establish that a given document was authenticated at a given time, making the trees publicly available,
and the weekly master hash gets printed in the New York Times classifieds

For those of you not in PacBell territory, PacBell really misunderstood
the Internet access market when they set their current rates.
ISDN costs $X/month (about 2-3 x POTS) plus (daytime) per-minute charges
of 4 cents, (nighttime 7pm-7am) free.  (This probably requires that
your ISP have Centrex access in your local calling area.)
What they didn't realize was that computer people think "It's free at night" means "It's free at night", so they dial up and stay on.
(Many of us non-ISDN users do the same with POTS, of course.)
ISDN call setup times are fast enough that it's possible to
do IP support that tears down calls after X seconds of non-use
and sets them up again when there's traffic, which is practical
since you don't have 30 seconds of modem retraining time per setup.
If PacBell's really bugged enough about usage patterns, they could

that let you get an extra digit or so of precision (remember when
precision was measured in digits rather than bits? :-)
There were also a variety of nomographs and other weird slide-rules
and graphical tools that were simple analog computers.  We used some
of them in electrical engineering classes for complex calculations
that didn't need to be highly precise, which most of them didn't
in a world where the extra-fancy resistors had 5% tolerances
and you achieved accuracy by adding various tweakers instead.
ObCrypto: Secret Decoder Rings are more or less circular slide rules,
but there really isn't much crypto you can do in analog.  :-)

One reason the market isn't more efficient is that it's only being played once, and the odds are pretty lopsided, since Dole really has no chance.
What's more interesting is that Ladbroke's aren't doing this themselves -

@_subject: Re: Is there a Win PGP? 
There are two separate issues - PGP with a Windows GUI, and PGP that really runs as a Windows process, rather than needing
to fire up a DOS window.  There are a dozen or so Windows GUIs for PGP,
many of which are on ftp.ox.ac.uk.  I especially like Private Idaho;
I think the path to it is  (also ftp.eskimo.com).
Current version is about 2.8 ; I'm not running it because it dropped
support for ViaCrypt (due to problems with ViaCrypt 4.0), and I like
using ViaCrypt.  I'm also having problems getting the older versions
to work on Windows NT (sigh...)
For a real Windows version, you can buy ViaCrypt (about $100-130?)
At least inside the US, to use the interesting RSA methods except through the
official external interfaces to RSAREF, you need permission from RSA.
Basic PGP for DOS/Unix/Mac has this, but there isn't a blessed Windows version except ViaCrypt, a commercial product.  For commercial applications,
you probably also need ViaCrypt anyway.  It was a nice product before they
added Key Escrow support.  Now that Phil has bought them, they'll presumably
return to political correctness on that issue.

Probably wearing a set of Ono-Sendai eyeballs....
You can read and compile the source code yourself.  You can learn crypto to help you understand the strength of the
algorithms.  I'd recommend Bruce Schneier's "Applied Cryptography".
You can look for bugs and subtle design flaws along with other people.
There are un-subtle design flaws, like the DOSoid user interface :-), and there are philosophical arguments about whether an identity-based
Web of Trust is the right trust model, and practical problems about
how to support revocation correctly, but basically it's Pretty Good Privacy.
On the other hand, there are other threats to think about.
Is there a virus, software bug, or trojan horse that captures the keystrokes you type into your computer?  If your passphrase is stolen, you lose.
PGP can't tell; it's just software.  What's on that yellow sticky note?
Is the NSA listening for electronic signals from that dark van
parked out in front of your house?  They're pretty good these days.
Your computer doesn't know, so PGP can't help you with it.
Are you using PGP to keep business records (like that second set of books)
which can be subpoenaed by a court?  When the IRS seizes your computer
and sees all those files with ------BEGIN PGP----- on them, can they
force you to reveal the keys or at least the contents?
PGP can't solve those problems for you.  But it can keep amateurs like
your local police department from reading the files you really care about
until they haul you in front of a court where you can bring a lawyer.
There are applications that PGP doesn't do, like keeping the blocks
on your disk drive automagically encrypted - it just does things to
files when you tell it to.  But you can at least encrypt the critical stuff,
and you can encrypt your email messages and other sensitive files
you transmit across a network.  Won't do any good for IRC...

Yeah.  If you keep a centralized list, it's too risky.
I've been thinking about how to implement a related approach -
when the mailer receives anonymous mail for you, it sends a message saying
        Subject: Anonymous message #         Hi!  You've got an anonymous message!          Here's how to retrieve it / block future messages / accept all
and you can send back the cookie to retrieve the message.
Blocking or accepting also using the cookie, to reduce denial-of-service
and spam attacks.  This approach is primarily useful for terminal remailers, but if you set up the syntax carefully, you can get the things to relay to each other.
It's not particularly useful for posting news, though.
Since it is good for terminal remailers, that may make it less hassle
to run them.

@_subject: Re: Why is cryptoanarchy irreversible? 
To a large extent, it's a volume question - if there's too much
widespread use, it's too hard to control, prevent, or ban later.
If the volumes of traffic and users are low, you can track users.
So the government's working hard to keep volume down, both by
export controls, FUD attacks on Phil, and constant offers to deal,
such as Clipper I, II, III, and IV, all of which both delay widespread use
of real crypto and try to introduce pre-wiretapped crypto instead.
Strong vs. weak crypto isn't the real issue - for most business use,
weak crypto is obviously unacceptable, but strong crypto with GAK
is ok as long as it doesn't interfere with use (and as long as the
government bureaucrats don't sell too many keys.)  After all, any corporation, and most businesses, can be forced to keep and produce records
when the government wants them to; a government-held master key
doesn't change their "legitimate" access, only the convenience
of legal and illegal access.  Key Recovery, on the other hand,
implies that you're required to either use GAK or use Weak Crypto,
which is obviously Bad.  Most businesses are far more opposed to things
that make them wait for bureaucratic action in their day-to-day business
than to the privacy issues, and they're more concerned about
control and convenience than the economic rights issues (otherwise
they'd be refusing to pay taxes....)
The government might be able to stop new Netscape versions from
using strong crypto - threatening to confiscate the company's
ill-gotten gains from aiding and abetting money launderers might help,
and threatening to confiscate PCs that use unapproved crypto.
But it's tough to use a widespread threat like that on popular
software once it's out there.
A friend of mine lives in a kleptocracy; the local thugs haven't stolen
his email provider's computer yet, mainly because the hardware
doesn't work very well without software and administrators.
But he's not willing to risk using PGP very often, because the
volume is small enough they can watch everything (they give him
enough trouble occasionally for using his native language on the phone
instead of the local languages.)  And sending stego isn't likely
to be a good solution for a while, since mail volume is low enough
to his remote area that sending lots of scanned photographs
would be a big impact on email costs.

@_subject: The American Black Chamber - Yardley - Re: 1996 Codebreakers 
I just got a copy* of the 1981 "The American Black Chamber", by
Herbert O. Yardley, with a new (1981) intro by Kahn. ISBN 0-345-29867-5.
The original had been published in 1931, went through a couple printings,
and sold twice as many copies in Japan as the US.  In 1933 the US passed a law banning the publishing of any material that had been published in
diplomatic codes, and of course they withheld permission for future printings.  Lots of good material on the state of crypto from WWI through the 1920s.
Crypto wasn't yet on a mathematical basis, though it was starting to
emerge in cryptanalysis.  After the World War ended, most of the traffic was
cracking diplomatic correspondence, especially for disarmament negotiations.
Getting users to take crypto seriously was a problem - most of the US
communications during the Spanish-American war used a sort of "rot-1898",
and even during the World War, military plans were often broadcast on
radio using wimpy codes, causing much damage to both sides.  Codes were generally designed by people who didn't have extensive cracking experience, and therefore most new codes were easily cracked as well.
Yardley's organization diverted some of its expertise to cracking secret
inks, which were extensively used by German spies.  Language and cultural
differences caused surprising difficulties - there was one person they could
find who knew German shorthand systems, and finding Japanese language
experience after the war was difficult, since they didn't want to use
Japanes immigrants for security reasons and most missionaries wouldn't do
military work (both for ethical reasons and because it would lead the
Japanese government to crack down on missions to Japan, Korea, and China.)
Kahn speculates that the ability to crack Japanese naval codes in WWII was
probably enhanced by Yardley's people's work - PURPLE was much stronger
than the earlier Japanese diplomatic codes, but the Japanese Navy believed
that "This time, it's all right" (cable chief, to foreign minister :-),
when it wasn't.
Yardley reports at the end of the book that he believed the science of
cryptography would die out - AT&T had invented a cypher machine during
the war, and had invented one-time pads, and the combination would make
code clerks obsolete and codes unbreakable......
Shortly after that, in 1929, the new Secretary of State was shocked to discover that his department was funding eavesdropping.         "Gentlemen don't read each others' mail."

@_subject: Re: Pyramid schemes and cryptoanarchy 
Aside from illegality, snail-mail pyramid spamming is rare because it costs
enough money per piece of mail that it's hard to make money given the
fraction of recipients who are both suckers and not too lazy to respond.
Email, on the other hand, is cheap, and sending large quantities is easy.
So you can expect to see a lot more email pyramid spamming, and electronic
money, whether digicash or traceable, will make it more popular.
On the other hand, I don't see anonymity helping it much - to the extent
that the public understands it, they'll realize that the people higher
up on the pyramid may all be tentacles, and they've got to mail out an address that's "theirs" to collect any money from lower-down suckers.
Dealing with complexity tends to encourage clues, or at least delay,
which is death for most pyramid scams.  Pyramid schemes benefit more from
traceable cash and non-anonymous suckers who can be targeted for later scams.
Multi-level marketing reacts interestingly with the Internet.
Where it's relatively legitimate, rather than a scam, it's a scaleable way for a company to hire a bunch of sales people that grows about as fast as the
sales of the product, who don't have to be paid if sales drop off,
and pay for advertising through sales people and word-of-mouth rather than expensive broadcasting.  The Internet and electronic communication in general
encourage small, flexible niche businesses that grow, sell stuff, and close.
So MLM is useful for them, especially if their product is physical stuff
rather than bits, and lower transaction costs make it easier to pay
the sales people (either anonymously or taxably....)
On the other hand, lower transaction costs make it easy to broadcast and
deliver information to potential customers and deliver stuff by NextDayAir,
and of course you can deliver bits for almost-free.  So MLM probably won't
work well for commodities with competing suppliers, like phone cards, soap, and high-tech motor oil, but may survive for products where personal
recommendations are important, like Super Blue-Green Algae and Smart Drugs, (where the sales rep and customer know each other and anonymity at most
keeps out greedy tax collectors and meddling FDA censors)
or where the sales person performs some useful part of the process,
like made-to-measure lingerie or direct personal loan collections.

Type a few lines of text, then look at the TV.
The sync wasn't quite right, but there were about three copies of
my DOS window.  It may have been scrolling slowly vertically or horizontally,
but it was relatively readable given the lack of resolution of the screen.
A good receiver run by a Bad Guy ought to be able to set its scan rates
correctly to pick up the screen at better resolution.

The draft regulations state that it is the aim of the  Commerce Department to promote "a worldwide key management infrastructure with the use of key recovery and key escrow encryption items." The proposal contrasts with earlier assurances that encryption standards would be voluntary and market-driven.  The regulations would amend the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by imposing national security and foreign policy controls ("EI" for Encryption Items) on certain information security systems and equipment,      cryptographic devices (including recoverable encryption software) and related technology.  For the first time, the Administration makes clear what it means by "Key Recovery Encryption." The regulations state that: For purposes of this rule, "recovery encryption products" refer to encryption products (including software) which allow law enforcement officials to obtain under proper legal authority and without           the cooperation or knowledge of the user, the plaintext of encrypted data and communications.
This is an exact description of the original Clipper encryption proposal that was widely opposed by Internet users and industry when it was announced in 1993.

@_subject: Re: PGPfone contact server 
[From a discussion on pgp-fone
I can think of a few useful variants on this kind of service
1) Incoming-Call-Notifier daemon - faster than email, smaller than pgpfone.
(PGPfone may not have a problem with this, but Netscape CoolTalk has a
watchdog daemon that hangs out waiting for calls.  Don't know if it barks,
but it's got to be smaller than NS+CT.  Firewalls generally kill these,
2) Chat-line with switch to voice - an IRC channel would do fine, and be
easy to set one up, for people who want to meet to play with the technology;
for people who want to cut out to PGPfone from other IRC groups, you don't
even need that, though distributing an IRC client with a "PGPfone" button
might be a good marketing technique.  Name the IRC channel "pgpfone"...
CU-SeeMe uses this approach - reflectors are often busy or way slow,
and the available public-access reflectors change pretty often,
and it's much easier to find people or find interesting reflectors
using the IRC channel than polling for busy-signals.  CU-SeeMe supports
conversations through reflectors as well as direct-connection,
and doing a PGPfone-like DC mode might be fun as well.
3) Finding specific people who don't have predictable IP addresses -
IRC can also do this, or email, but it wouldn't be hard to build a
web form widget that lets you plug in your name/handle and scarfs up your current IP address or lets you enter it.
A "specific person" could be an alias, of course.
4) A secure n-person conference bridge could be good also,
though it's much more difficult to make something like that work,
especially if you use a crypto mode that dislikes dropped packets.

Anyone who stores a $10m proposal on only one machine, without making backups on somebody else's machine, preferably

disk drive gremlins and software from Bill Gates to scribble on his disk,
and his company should probably consider 86ing him before he

Slightly more seriously, there are certainly corporate reasons to
store backups of keys for important data, such as backup tapes
and communications.  GAK-style technology is the wrong level approach
for communications -  GAK-style access to keys is useless unless
you've also backed up the data, so if your corporate officers need
the data, give it to them encrypted with their own keys.
Similarly, if you want backup access to keys used to encrypt files, back up the keyrings, maybe using a secret-sharer if you want to require
multiple people to access the backup, or just have the backups of the files encrypted with the keys for the backup server. #			Thanks;  Bill

@_subject: Password Keystroke Snarfer Programs 
Several articles on the PGP-users mailing list have discussed
keystroke snarfers that unexpectedly grab and save keystrokes,
including passwords, severely weakening any benefits from encryption.
taoboy  mentioned Mac programs FileGuard and HiddenOasis and the SpellCatcher spell-check program's Ghostwriter feature,
which he'd noticed had stuck his password into a disk file;
he suggests that Windows machines probably have similar surprises.
Be careful - PGP goes to a lot of effort to overwrite your passphrase
when it's done using it; Norton or grep or other disk-crawlers are unlikely
to do so, because that sort of paranoia's not part of their job,
and simply typing in a command in a command window will often get it saved
in a command history file.  So your search for the passphrase on disk makes it
_more_ likely that some program will stash it on your disk...
You could work around this by using a complex passphrase and adding a distinctive word to the end, e.g. "mumblefrotz foobaroid zarquon FINDTHIS",
which doesn't become much less secure if the FINDTHIS gets left on the disk
from your "grepemall FINDTHIS c:" command.

a suspected-Commie bit, a check-FBI-files-first bit, etc.  The subliminal channels in DSS are the best known method for doing this, but it's probably
possible to do something similar even using blind signatures, especially

They're not widely available yet; I don't know if any of the (US)

the technology works over copper wire, so it has to be offered at
your local telco wire center.  Of course, your local telco has to have something useful to do with the bits once the user sends
them to the telco, and has to have some useful bits to send the user.
This means they've got to haggle about standards for 5 more years
(or just do the right thing and deploy IP, with some respectable
bandwidth to the outside world) (or deploy ATM to get a layer 2

For individuals, and voluntary groups of individuals, that's certainly true.
But what about taxpayers involuntarily paying for a network run by
bureaucrats -
does each individual have an equal right to decide what he/she will say
or read on the net, or are some individuals more equal than others?  And if
so, why is it the armed thugs who want to censor people who get to be more equal?
It's the usual insoluable problem about how to decide policy for
involuntarily-funded services - the government is morally obligated to
follow the wishes of everybody paying for them, which are in radical conflict.
It's bad enough with schools...  The Arpanet had its Acceptable Use Policy,
which limited speech on goverment-funded parts of the net to non-commercial
one of main drivers behind the Commercial Internet Exchange was to
allow businesses to send each other email without being limited by it.
And then there's the French Telecom Monopoly (until it falls apart) -
if you don't like the rules the bureaucrats make for what you can say or read,
you're not even allowed to build your own telecom network or obtain services from providers who don't censor what you can say or read.
And I also don't support the French government's attempt at forcing its own

@_subject: Re: Hi again, and an invitation to kibitz 
In addition to David Wagner's comments, I'd like to point out
several more weaknesses.
- Would Kerberos work just as well?  No sense reinventing the 3-headed dog.
- You're not authenticating the server to the client.
- If the challenge is different every time, the server needs to   keep the user's password in plaintext (unlike Unix encrypted passwords.)
  This means that attacks on the server's file system can steal it,
  and since the password is used for session encryption, it can be
  used to forge sessions as well.
- Alternatively, if the challenge is always the same (per user),
  then even one eavesdrop kills you, as with Unix passwords.
- Since you're using the same 7-byte password hash for the
  first third of the authentication as for the session key,
  the dictionary attack on E(challenge, First-seven-bytes)
  gives you the session key, so you can eavesdrop just fine.
  If the password is too short, you can then dictionary-attack MD4
  to find it also.
- There's a Diffie-Hellman variant that can do logins.    Unfortunately, it's patented (by some guy from Siemens in Paderborn DE,   who patented it in Germany about 2 years before I rediscovered it,   and patented it in the US about 6 months before :-)    It covers any login methods using commutative hashes H1(H2(x)) == H2(H1(x)).
  The Siemens version extends it to authenticate both ends to each other;
  I extended it to get a session key for encryption and/or authentication.
  This really shouldn't have been patentable - my rediscovery shows that
  it must be pretty obvious to anyone skilled in the trade :-), and rather
  than reinventing the wheel, I was reinventing the hubcap or tire swing....
In particular, an 8 byte challenge is nowhere near enough, though the average million-dollar DES-cracker won't be as easy to adapt for 2**64 cycles of hash+DES*3 - and don't handle each third separately!
At least do something like 3DES-EDE and return an 8-byte response,

Using >=16 bytes of challenge would be better, or >=24 if you want printable challenges.
You may not be able to replay a given challenge usefully, assuming it's

You're much safer if you're using an operating system instead of a

easier to run applications like telnet servers that allow someone
else to connect to your system while you're on line.
Some different ways you could be at risk include
- someone sends you a keystroke-sniffer program and tricks your machine
into running it - so it grabs your passphrase from PI or PGP and
sends it in later
- someone sends you a keystroke-sniffer program and tricks _you_
into running it, whether they use email, web, etc.
- someone logs into your system, guesses that the root password is
"trustno1", and modifies your copy of PGP to save keystrokes.
(On MSDOS, of course, you don't _need_ a root password.)
- someone sets up a web page with an evil ActiveX script that
convinces your Internet Explorer to download a new copy of PGP.
- someone sends you email with an attachment named ..\..\..\windows\pgp.exe and your mail system is dumb enough to accept the pathname.
- somebody sends you email with an MS-Word/Excel/PPT attachment that,
instead of having a dumb Concept macro virus, has a macro that
does something useful like replace your copy of PGP, and you don't
have any innoculation on your MS-Word.

It's really embarassing to have to pay salaries of "public employees"
who can't come up with better arguments than the paper/magnetic/OCR nonsense
but don't have the guts to stop trying and admit they've wrong.
Does the President still make $200K/year salary?  You'd think he'd either
read what he signs or tell his employees to only ask him to sign
at least half-way credible stuff.  The old regulations used to pretend that
foreigners were too dumb to implement computer programs from algorithms;
now they're pretending that foreigners are too dumb to type.*
People used to say we have the best politicians money can buy, but you ought to be able to buy better politicians than that.
The basic difference between "easily OCRed source code" and "not easily
OCRed source code" is pretty much limited to two things
1) Half-decent print quality (black on white in Courier at 300dpi should do....)
        As Tim says, this stuff is child's play.  Back when OCRs were
        $10,000 machines with cutting-edge 68010 processors,
        reading Courier was pretty easy but it helped to put in checksums;
        these days you don't really need that.  (It also didn't like
        wet-process 240-dpi laser printing or faxes, but modern OCR software
        can generally deal with good-quality faxes and 2) Bound pages vs. loose pages (printing with perforated pages
        or selling the source code in loose-leaf might count as an
        "attractive nuisance" :-), but a band-saw can solve that problem
        for the OCR user unless it's printed on Tyvek or something silly :-)
In the Karn case, the Feds made the silly argument that the
floppy disk version had the files neatly separated, while the
paper version split files between pages and had page numbers at the
bottoms of the pages that weren't part of the source code.
Even the $10K 68010 wonderbox could handle page headers/footers and margins, and modern software can do decent translations into different
word processor formats.
There's one German university that OCRed the MIT PGP source code book.
The PGP folks passed out copies of their new 3.0 Pre-Alpha and an update
at a recent Cypherpunks meeting.  See
 for ordering informaiton.  It's been donated to some local libraries, such as San Jose CA, and I hope they'll send it to the Library of Congress
and various non-US university and other public libraries - the recent
rules change clarifying that it's ok to export source code should make
this much easier.   [* OK, it's not really possible to type or proofread perl code accurately :-)
More to the point, OCRs aren't always real good about `backquotes' and other
little blotchy marks that some languages use, and even humans don't always
get them right.]

including locating your victim.
Cordless phones don't offer an expectation of privacy, by some legal
definition, so it's not illegal, and anyone can listen in with scanners, including police,
unless there are state or local laws to the contrary  It'd be interesting
to test
the legal status of digital spread-spectrum cordless phones, which claim on
the box to offer privacy, but there probably aren't enough police forces with
sufficiently advanced scanners to crack them to make it worth transmitting
lots of bait "Yo, Bubba, I hear you've got 10 kilos of dope for sale!" "Yeah, it's $10/gram, I'll bring it by your house at 1234 Main Street."
Analog callphones don't.  (U.S.) Digital cellphones may offer encryption,
though it's really dumbed-down encryption.  It'll probably still keep out
Beavis and Butthead, and maybe your local police, but not professionals.
I've forgotten if the CAVE encryption on John Young's site is the US version,
or if the standard we're graciously permitted by our government to use
is a different one, but it's about that strength.  Phil Karn wrote
some time ago about the NSA's armtwisting that bullied the standards
committee into coming up with the stuff.
Analog cellphones were doing well to work at all, and manufacturers and
service providers didn't want to add the complexity of encryption,
especially as a retrofit, so they got a law passed instead.
Tapping cellphones is more trouble than tapping wired phones -
they move around, and to tap them from the phone company end
requires taps everywhere that you activate when you know where
somebody is.  On the other hand, if you can just scan for them,
and crack the wimpy encryption, it's really a lot less work.
And if you overhear other interesting conversations while pursuing
a legally authorized wiretap, that was "good faith"...

Actually, it's less obvious than that :-)
The only way to get a security rating of B2 or above (or even D or above)
is to submit your operating system for rating by the NCSC, which is
a long, expensive process even for C2.  By the time you get to B2,
you're dealing with products that may have real-world uses but are
primarily designed specifically for the military market. One of the sensitivities, besides keeping Scary Foreigners from getting
Real Operating Systems, is that it makes it easier for the Scary
Foreigners to look for any bugs the NCSC may have missed and understand
any other weaknesses that the products may have which would let them
break into US Military or Intelligence Agency systems.

The first software patent was Dennis Ritchie's patent on setUID.
Computer security is one area that, if you're going to allow patents
on software at all (which I think are a bad idea, but that's politics),
are likely to yield novel processes that will benefit the public
if they're published.  If you want an "innocent" explanation,
it's that computers were finally starting to be affordable enough
and software to be portable enough that there was a software market
developing, and therefore there was money to be made (or stolen.)
Before the mid-70s, there wasn't really much software that wasn't either obvious to a skilled practitioner (hence non-patentable),
or else intimately tied to tweaky little details of some hardware product,
where the hardware is patentable and the manufacturer is perfectly
_happy_ to have everybody write non-portable code that locks you into
using a FooBar 9000, while letting them claim that this code lets
you run your applications 99.44% faster on the 9000 than on an IBM.
And most early software patent applications _did_ include descriptions
of some tweaky hardware implementation to make them fit better
into the Patent Office mindset.
Of course, the Patent Office, which didn't hire "software engineers"
for a long time, had entirely no clue about what was obvious to skilled
practitioners, so they've let all kinds of things be patented that
were widely used in the trade, like XOR cursors and online commerce.
But that's a flame for another newsgroup.
D,H,R,S, and A didn't _have_ to apply for patents....
With hardware security products, the NSA has the power to seize and
classify systems which are applying for patents, for no particularly
good reason, and they used to do it often.  For instance, there was
an analog scrambler for CB radios that got its patent applications
seized in about 1980.  And most software patent applications for
crypto have involved machinations to avoid getting trapped by this,
like publishing in foreign journals before submitting applications.

No, they don't, though the airlines like you to think that
since it simplifies their life and it's something they can tell

There is no national rule that applies to everybody requiring it;
each airline apparently has to negotiate with the FAA to make sure
they're doing a "reasonable" job of identifying their passengers.
The airline is free to make whatever rules they want.
On United, I normally use my employee ID and the credit card I use
to buy the electronic-ticket, which verifies reasonably well that
I'm the person the ticket was bought for (by the people who
told the airline they're my employer's travel agents.)
If the _government_ required _you_ to have government ID,
there'd be serious Constitutional problems with it;
regulating interstate commerce and air traffic safety by
forcing the airlines to do something they'd kind of like
to do anyway doesn't have the same problems, even though it's
almost _more_ offensive to a free society.

Welcome!  You've asked a Frequently Asked Question, so you're obviously new here, but you're also thinking, so we'll cut you some slack :-)
A good book on cryptography that you should read is Bruce Schneier's
"Applied Cryptography", which talks about both math and practical issues.
Pseudo-Randomness isn't Real Randomness, and OTPs need Real Randomness.
[Von Neumann said that anyone using mathematical methods to generate
random numbers "is, of course, in a state of sin."]
If you've got a Pseudo-RNG, your random number generator has some state
at step 1 that totally determines the output at steps 2...infinity.
This means that anybody who can determine the state of the PRNG at
step n can decode all messages for steps n+1, n+2, ...., and often
for steps 1....n-1 as well (depending on the particular PRNG.)
If you're got Real Randomness*, even if you know the value of the
pad at step n, it tells you entirely nothing about any other step.
To make it worse, the popular PRNGs turn out to be annoyingly easy
to crack, i.e. to determine the state from a small number of samples.
Unfortunately, passing randomness tests doesn't tell you a pad is
"truly random" - it just eliminates the blatantly easy stuff.
For instance, x[n+1] = Hash( x[n] ) or X[n+1] = Encrypt( x[n] )
for a cryptographically strong hash function or encryption like MD5 or SHA or 3-DES will pass randomness tests just fine,
but it's still totally deterministic.  Still not a OTP.
However, say you create the pad from really random sources like
flipping lots of coins or counting gamma rays, and haul it to your
computers by well-armed guys with briefcases handcuffed to their wrists.
If the pad is _really_ random, and you're sure nobody's seen any of it,
then there's no difference between starting at a random point and
starting at the beginning, and the bookkeeping is much cleaner.
Yeah, you've got it (once you remember to use a really random pad
so there's entirely no relationship between bits n and n+1.)
And you've also hit one of the basic difficulties with using OTPs,
which is making sure you only use the once, and that this means
that sometimes you run out AND YOU STILL CAN'T USE THE PAD AGAIN.
The NSA was able to crack a bunch of Russian OTP transmissions back
in the 50s (the project name was Venona, and it was recently announced)
because the Russians did two major things wrong: They used pads more
than once when they were sloppy or out of new pads, and they didn't
use very good randomness - clerks banging "randomly" on typewriters
generate data with more correlation and less even distribution than
they'd expect, and in nearly-pre-computer days they weren't able

them to the telco, and has to have some useful bits to send the user.
This means they've got to haggle about standards for 5 more years

Guess what - it's still got "key escrow"!  If you've got a smartcard

be subpoenaed....  It's better than Yankee-style giving the government your

On the other hand, it's voluntary, and if it interoperates with

On the other hand, the cell sites already know which you're close to,

So they can get a good start on location by processing information that the

For individuals, and voluntary groups of individuals, that's certainly true.
But what about taxpayers involuntarily paying for a network run by
bureaucrats -
does each individual have an equal right to decide what he/she will say
or read on the net, or are some individuals more equal than others?  And if
so, why is it the armed thugs who want to censor people who get to be more equal?
It's the usual insoluable problem about how to decide policy for
involuntarily-funded services - the government is morally obligated to
follow the wishes of everybody paying for them, which are in radical conflict.
It's bad enough with schools...  The Arpanet had its Acceptable Use Policy,
which limited speech on goverment-funded parts of the net to non-commercial
one of main drivers behind the Commercial Internet Exchange was to
allow businesses to send each other email without being limited by it.
And then there's the French Telecom Monopoly (until it falls apart) -
if you don't like the rules the bureaucrats make for what you can say or read,
you're not even allowed to build your own telecom network or obtain services from providers who don't censor what you can say or read.
And I also don't support the French government's attempt at forcing its own
subjects on French soil to use French.  Asking them nicely, or running
against Academically-incorrect French, is something the Academie can do itself.

@_subject: Re: Hi again, and an invitation to kibitz 
In addition to David Wagner's comments, I'd like to point out
several more weaknesses.
- Would Kerberos work just as well?  No sense reinventing the 3-headed dog.
- You're not authenticating the server to the client.
- If the challenge is different every time, the server needs to   keep the user's password in plaintext (unlike Unix encrypted passwords.)
  This means that attacks on the server's file system can steal it,
  and since the password is used for session encryption, it can be
  used to forge sessions as well.
- Alternatively, if the challenge is always the same (per user),
  then even one eavesdrop kills you, as with Unix passwords.
- Since you're using the same 7-byte password hash for the
  first third of the authentication as for the session key,
  the dictionary attack on E(challenge, First-seven-bytes)
  gives you the session key, so you can eavesdrop just fine.
  If the password is too short, you can then dictionary-attack MD4
  to find it also.
- There's a Diffie-Hellman variant that can do logins.    Unfortunately, it's patented (by some guy from Siemens in Paderborn DE,   who patented it in Germany about 2 years before I rediscovered it,   and patented it in the US about 6 months before :-)    It covers any login methods using commutative hashes H1(H2(x)) == H2(H1(x)).
  The Siemens version extends it to authenticate both ends to each other;
  I extended it to get a session key for encryption and/or authentication.
  This really shouldn't have been patentable - my rediscovery shows that
  it must be pretty obvious to anyone skilled in the trade :-), and rather
  than reinventing the wheel, I was reinventing the hubcap or tire swing....
In particular, an 8 byte challenge is nowhere near enough, though the average million-dollar DES-cracker won't be as easy to adapt for 2**64 cycles of hash+DES*3 - and don't handle each third separately!
At least do something like 3DES-EDE and return an 8-byte response,
or hash the three output bytes together and send the hash.
Using >=16 bytes of challenge would be better, or >=24 if you want printable challenges.
You may not be able to replay a given challenge usefully, assuming it's
different each time, but MITM attacks work ok after you've cracked the
password by dictionary attack in the previous round.

You're much safer if you're using an operating system instead of a

Some different ways you could be at risk include

sends it in later
- someone sends you a keystroke-sniffer program and tricks _you_

- someone logs into your system, guesses that the root password is
"trustno1", and modifies your copy of PGP to save keystrokes.
(On MSDOS, of course, you don't _need_ a root password.)
- someone sets up a web page with an evil ActiveX script that
convinces your Internet Explorer to download a new copy of PGP.
- someone sends you email with an attachment named ..\..\..\windows\pgp.exe and your mail system is dumb enough to accept the pathname.
- somebody sends you email with an MS-Word/Excel/PPT attachment that,
instead of having a dumb Concept macro virus, has a macro that
does something useful like replace your copy of PGP, and you don't
have any innoculation on your MS-Word.

There may be separate restrictions on sending it, or on copying,
but they're based on copyright or contractual non-disclosure.

"Hand over what?" "You, know, the thingie" "What thingie?" "The one they steal from mailmen in Miami" "You mean this?"
"No, it wouldn't be one of them, not worth enough"
"How about one of these?" "Maybe, but that's probably not it"
"My mailbag?" "No, that's too obvious."
"ID card?" "No, you don't look enough like me"

Of course, as Toto suggested, it could be just that the carriers are delivering dope on the side, or maybe they're

At 09:58 AM 7/15/96 -0400, about six months ago, when Clipper III was new,
Unfortunately, the Government hasn't given up on this one;
Peter Gutman's recent articles on export policy in New Zealand and

Yeah.  I haven't heard much from Clipper III recently,
since they've been trumpeting Clipper IV "Key Recovery" recently,
but that doesn't mean it's not going on.  Unlike politican efforts
such as Key Recovery, infrastructure attacks such as PKI
may require long-term technical development - the Cooperative
Research and Development Alliances (CRADAs) are not just to
bribe otherwise-valuable companies to stay out of the way,
they're to do things that may be sprung on us later;
I'd predict this coming summer.  For instance, back in July,
John Young quoted a Business Wire article about

Certicom are the folks who do Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems,
which haven't been used much due to patent questions and RSA's dominance, but which allow much shorter public keys
and may have some speed advantages, both of which are
quite important for smartcard use.
It failed, and they've now got an Ambassador strong-arming other countries
to prohibit export.
Yeah.  Clipper IV is getting a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon
to get export permission for their 56-bit software.  Many of the people
who are most vocal about it are the usual suspects anyway, but it's
closer to commercial usability that industry's more cooperative this round,
especially with more Internet money fever.

The big argument against going to a newsgroup in the past
was that signal-to-noise would degrade to the point of alt.2600ness
due to newbies, flamers, overflow to/from political ranting newsgroups, etc.,
and there's already a sci.crypt for that.  The main argument
in favor of moderation has been that the list has become unreadable
due to newbies, flamers, political ranting, and directed attacks
and maybe moderation would fix it, at the cost of annoying people
who don't like moderation (which is realistically most of us;
two practical reasons not to have moderation are that the volume is too high
for most people to be willing to moderate, and that the delays inherent in the moderation process reduce the interactivity that's
been one of the valuable things about this list.)  I'd prefer that
we all just get along, but things really were getting uncivil.
An advantage of Usenet is the ability to deploy whatever NoCeM is
called these days as a way to let people avoid spammers.
Personally, I'd switched to the fcpunx filtered list a couple months ago,
mainly to cut down on volume but also because I was getting fed up
with Vulis's attacks through remailers, which were getting to be
too much trouble to filter out.  I switched back to the main list
after the moderation announcement, with Eudora filters
to make some discussions and some people go away.
Of course, there have been several different demonstrations of
ways around the moderation since then.

For optically-scannable printed data, the government's announcement says it reserves (somehow) its right (acquired in unspecified manner :-)
to re-evaluate the exportability at a later time.  I think they
haven't settled on whether they'd be more embarassed by banning it
(which bans export of printed material, risking serious Constitutional
challenges) or by not banning it (having people laugh at them while
exporting source code or even binaries in OCR-A on loose-leaf paper

If I were going to restart a remailer, and to offer news posting,
I'd probably limit it to posting to moderated newsgroups only,
so a human can trash things that look like SPAM or abuse;
the abuse that caused me to kill my remailer wasn't something
a simple filter would catch.  (I'd also prefix each posting with a header about this message having been received from an anonymous source,
not verified, not guaranteed to be worth the electrons it's printed on,
probably not written by anybody whose name's at the bottom, etc....
People don't read mail headers or disclaimers at the bottom,
and putting disclaimers like that into message text for
email exposes the message to traffic analysis.)
Alt.anonymous.messages is an interesting alternative, but one of the ideals of posting news from a remailer is to allow people to broadcast politically incorrect speech anonymously, avoiding censorship
and retribution as much as possible.  This means letting people
call Lee Kwan Yew a fascist, complain that OJ's a space alien,
identify the person Hillary paid to off Vince Foster,
or proclaim that Hubbard's Ahmaddiyya Witnesses are the One True Religion -- Or post the One Page RSA+RC4 to the China newsgroups.
On the other hand, I don't want to support postings titled
"ALL FAGS MUST DIE" with a forged signature and email at the bottom,
and I especially don't want to post that from my remailer without
indicating that anything posted by a remailer might be forged.
That's why I shut down my previous remailer - the forger only
posted one forged message; the person whose name got forged
got flamed severely by dozens of people who objected to "her" posts.
Blocking the gay newsgroups cuts down on that kind of trolling,
but also cuts out the "Help, I might be gay and my parents will kill me"
traffic that remailers are supposed to help with.
On several other hands, though, even if you limit news posting,
trolls can abuse a remailer by sending email to large mailing lists.
It'd certainly never happen to Cypherpunks :-), but some other
mailing lists might attract trolls, and it's not easy to
identify them in advance (though I suppose adding a disclaimer
and cutmarks any time you post to something other than a known remailer is a partial solution.)

the military does also check FBI records (and the FBI probably doesn't

Nuclear clearances presumably go into more depth...
As far as your friend being visited by the FBI several times,
that's obviously part of an ongoing criminal investigation (:-),
so they don't have to tell you.  If they're still thinking about
going back and harassing your friend, it's still ongoing, even if
they now know that he is or is not a Commie Sympathizer.
That, or they could have just been unable to find the records.
Anything computerized should be findable (doesn't mean it _is_,
just that it should be), though they're probably more organized
about finding things they want to find than finding things
you want them to find.  But records that exist only on paper
are a lot tougher to wade through; you can't grep dead trees,
and if your friend was being checked out as "somebody suspicious
who knows somebody we're trying to investigate/harass", the files
may not be indentified under your friend's name, or may be

Suppose you're sending a message on a remailer chain of
you -> Alice->Bob->Charlie->Dave->Eve->Fred--> target
and Bob puts lots of disclaimers in his remailer's outgoing messages.
Anything Bob puts in a header will get stripped out by Charlie,
so it's no problem.  However, if Bob tacks a disclaimer
as the bottom text in the outgoing message, when Eve sends
mail to Fred she'll also see the disclaimer that
so she'll know to check the FBI Illegal Wiretap files for Bob.
Some comments and backtracking
0) Of course, if you want to avoid traffic analysis,
sending unencrypted email is pretty stupid, and only the
next hop is going to see a disclaimer that you append after the encrypted part of the message.
1) Prepending the disclaimer to the message body is
pretty unfriendly to the :: syntax, and not all that
great for PGP encrypted messages either.  Pretend I really just suggested appending it at the end,
since that's what I would have said if I'd been thinking :-)
On the other hand, I suppose that you can see whether the
next hop is a Type I remailer by looking for the :: or 2) Cutmarks would be a nice fix, but they require too much
attention to detail to get right, in case the next hop
is a remailer.
So maybe you _should_ always put in the disclaimer,
at the end, with a reminder to always encrypt your
remailer-chain mail if you want to avoid traffic analysis :-)

You don't bet the bank on 40-bit crypto, unless you're, ummm, accepting credit cards over wimp-configured sessions of SSL.  (You, as merchant,
may not lose if there's a forgery, and your customer's loss may be limited
to $50,
but the bank's loss isn't limited except by how fast they can block thieves.)
While banks get Extra Slack on crypto exports, and can use 56-bit DES,
they've got more serious adversaries - building a $1M machine to win a $1000
contest is a bit expensive for the average grad student, but it's a perfectly reasonable investment if you're planning to rob banks of
millions of dollars with it, especially if you think you can either
siphon the money off slowly while hitting a lot of banks or else
make a really big haul all at once.  Banks aren't the only kind of company with big money floating around;
stockbrokers, commodities traders, purchasing departments of big companies
that might not notice that they're buying a few percent more parts,
and all sorts of other large companies are targets for crypto-cracking
Because well-funded thieves can do this kind of financial damage,
we have a legitimate-sounding spin on "Federal law enforcement's job includes preventing large-scale theft, and they're letting their political agenda
get in the way of doing their job.  Sure, 56-bit keys are harder to crack
than 40,
but well-funded crackers could use the same techniques Ian did."
Either method of theft requires being non-stupid enough not to get caught
afterwards (like the $(24?)M computerized bank job last year), and having your
"partners" not rip you off; a big heist also risks detection by tracking chip
purchases, and
provoking the Feds into banning "ASIC Laundering" and criminalizing illegal possesion of field-programmable gate arrays and such paranoid

The International Internet Ad-Hoc Committee released its report
on new Top Level Domains for the Internet.  It's interesting,
and resulted from much political wrangling and religious conflict,
and for the most part I think it's taking a reasonable approach
to the problems, and I'm certainly not going to go postal like
Postmaster Karl Denninger :-)  A few particularly nice features:
Mostly I wasn't worried, because sensible people were going to make sure they didn't do anything totally disastrous.
Apparently I _should_ have been watching more closely, because the SLD
_Second_ Level Domain part has some policies that seriously interfere
with the privacy of potential domain name users.  References and long quotes are below...
To a large extent, they've been trying to avoid getting stuck in
trademark problems by collecting lots of information and defining
jurisdiction.  In the process, they're asking you to sign away your first-born child
in return for getting your name in the Yellow Pages(tm),
and they're requiring all the Registrars to reject your application
unless you do.  The rules are especially inappropriate for the .nom domain,
which is for personal names and such, and don't need overkill.
There's a place for serious high-value commerce behaviour,
and much of this isn't too inappropriate for .firm - but even that
ignores the radical communication-pushed changes in the economy that make everybody able to run a worldwide business. It's not just that they want your email address (highly reasonable)
or your phone and physical address (ought to be optional) or your IP address (they don't ask) or domain name (ok) or digital or written
It's not even just obnoxious things like demanding that you swear (against _my_ religion...) to a bunch of things, like
"the reason for requesting this particular domain name"
or what you're planning to do with the domain name (perfectly reasonable
things to ask for as optional extras, and business may want to reveal these,
but "Decline to State" or "" or "MYOB" are perfectly reasonable responses.)
It's things like designating an agent for service of process, and
"submits to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction and venue of a competent tribunal in the country where the registrar resides".
Aside from believing that you ought to be able to choose what governments,
if any, you're going to subject yourself to, I'd also expect that this
would be
annoying to people who don't live in one of the <=28 countries that
get Registrars in them.  And certainly if you're going to designate
someone as an agent for service of process (you can use the Registrar)
there'd better be some contractual language available so you can tell
what you're swearing to.
Is it reasonable to have a policy that users need to indicate how they'd like to receive communications about name and trademark disputes?
Sure.  And that they hold the Registrar harmless in such disputes?  Probably.
And which dispute resolution organization they're willing to have
resolve disputes over names (a _much_ milder statement than
"submit to personal and subject matter jurisdiction"....)?  Yeah, even if the default is "the Registrar can disconnect your name
if you don't respond to trademark complaints in N days."
Certainly the Registrar ought to have some options here.

SLD application Application for a second-level domain name must include:      Sufficient contact and intended use information
     Appointment of an agent for service of process
     Agreement to jurisdiction in the event of trademark litigation.
     Mediation and arbitration clause (discussed in a later section) A separate document entitled "SLD Applications" (see section 1.4) contains the information that must be included in a SLD application.
Applications submitted electronically must include state of the art electronic identification; written applications must be signed by the
applicant, if an individual, or by an officer or other legally authorized representative if the applicant is an entity. Renewal and non-use To promote accountability, discourage extortion and minimize obsolete
entries, SLD assignments must be renewed annually. Appendix B, attached, includes the information that must be included in a renewal application. Renewal applications submitted electronically must include state of the art electronic identification; written renewal applications must be signed by the applicant, if an individual, or by an officer or other legally authorized representative if the applicant is an entity. In addition to requiring annual renewal, CORE will develop policies to ensure the recovery of sub-domains which no longer have an
authoritative source (lame delegations). 6.2 Discussion
In order to ensure consistency of basic service across registrars, certain information is required in all applications for SLDs under
gTLDs. It is desirable that a domain name application include sufficient information regarding the applicant and the applicant's intended
use of the domain name to ensure applicant accountability and to ensure that sufficient information is available to enable trademark
owners to assess the need for a challenge to the proposed SLD domain. ================= [more stuff]
7.1.3 Publication
All applications for SLDs in the gTLDs will be published on a publicly available, publicized web site, immediately upon receipt by the registrar. Such publication entries will include:      Name of the SLD;
     Contact and use information contained in the application;
     A permanent tag or label (created by CORE) indicating whether        the applicant chose the option of waiting 60 days prior to
       assignment of the requested SLD or chose to forego the 60 day wait;
     Entry validation using accepted digital signature and timestamping
techniques. Those applicants choosing not to wait will not be in a position to claim the defensive benefit of the waiting period against a challenge,
at any time, by a trademark owner. 11.1 Appendix A - SLD Application Requirements
Every application for assignment of a SLD must include the following elements (incomplete applications must be returned to the applicant for completion):    1.Applicant's name, business or residential address, email address,    2.The state or country of incorporation or partnership (if applicable).    3.The name and address of a designated agent for service of process       in the case of an individual.

unless someone proves P=NP in the far mythical future or proves that
factoring is in or near P.
The interesting questions are at the boundaries of strong crypto
and weak crypto - 40 bits is a nasty joke, DES is still interesting
for things that don't have too much money riding on them,
Skipjack is probably strong enough for a few years unless there's a second back door next to the one with the big "Cops Only" neon sign.
How strong can we make something and still get export permission?
Do we care?  What are the threat models for different "Key Recovery"
and are we willing to write deliberatlely weak code to collaborate?
Are the non-RSA public key systems good enough until the patent expires?
There are some boundary problems that are interesting for non-political
reasons - now that every toaster and digital wristwatch has an IP
and a few KB of RAM, what kind of useful crypto will fit in them?
Key distribution is still interesting - how do you make a system that's
convenient enough to use and secure enough to work?  And distributed
cracking systems are interesting, though the main uses for them are
for cracking known-weak cryptosystems.
Then there's the field of secure databases, which I think has both
practical potential and scientific merit - how do you mix data together
without leaking the secure stuff to unauthorized users, either directly
or through combining lots of non-privileged data.

@_subject: Re: lead remailer is shut down 
Most remailers have some basic spam safeguards, typically
how many messages per day or per session or whatever.
They also implement blocking on specific source or destinations,
which makes it easier to stop known spam sources and reduce
hassle for people who don't want to be spammed.
Limited number of posts per source or per destination are less useful,
since people use chained remailers - most messages will have a
remailer as either the source, destination, or both,
so it's fairly common to have lots of messages from one source.
Mass crossposts aren't all that bad; if you're running a decent
newsreader you'll only see that kind of spam once.  The bad ones are
multiple identical or nearly-identical messages posted to one or
a few newsgroups each, which are harder to detect and much more annoying to the reader.  On the other hand, NoCeMs can catch them,
if anybody's sending and using them.
I don't know how many people have the capability to block on Subject:
or message content; I remember getting bouncemails for things that
had variants on M AK E  M O N E Y  F A S T in them, so there are or were
other remailers that block those.
It's hard to find a good definition of spam, and hard to implement it
without keeping lots of extra records you'd probably rather not keep,
and spammers who are willing to do work can find out your limits,
especially if they're in a policy document somewhere, and evade them,
sending as much through each remailer as fits under the radar.
Fortunately, most spammers don't bother.
Back when I was running a remailer, it was a modified Ghio2 version;
I'd fixed some bugs in it, and took the spam detector behavior from
highly rude (shutting itself down quietly) to mildly rude (shutting
itself down noisily); the basic model was to stop entirely under
big spam attacks and let a human fix it up, rather than trying to resolve
them subtlely, which is more appropriate for small spamming.
The advantage of this approach is that you don't have mysterious
message losses; it's all or nothing.  (Well, you still get some mysterious losses, but mostly from bugs or interactions with
other types of remailers.)

@_subject: Re: Query on "secure databases" 
Hi, Peter - here's my previous posting, with an addendum, Cc: cypherpunks
It's been a long time since I've looked much into it, since I
was getting out of phone-company-defense-contractor mode at the time the
field was developing.  I think the NCSC Rainbow Book that deals
with secure databases is the Purple Book, though it might be the Gray.
Oracle and/or Sybase have done some work trying to do databases
at the B1 or B2 level, but I don't know details.  I'll talk about secure databases a bit, but for the real world
there's more useful stuff that isn't related to them.
=================== Begin "Secure Database" Section ==============
At the time, the Orange Book (security for standalone computers) was well-understood, though there weren't really any systems above B2 level,
and the Red Book was written, but nobody really had a clue how to
implement multi-level machines on a multi-level LAN, though
you could use encrypting Ethernet cards to get single-level machines
of different levels on the same LAN, if they were all administered
by the same group of people (so user-IDs and security levels
worked across the entire system.)  At the lower security levels, Orange Book techniques mainly involve removing bugs and adding accounting features.  At the higher levels, the key is to come up with a good mathematical/logical model of
interactions in your computer system, and then design a computer system
that only does the things permitted by the model and prove it does that.
Some of these systems use cryptographic techniques, including some of
the capability-based systems - see Bill Frantz's KeyKOS work, which he's
referred to on Cypherpunks occasionally. The objective is to have databases that can be accessed by multiple users
with different sets of security permissions.  In the military vernacular,
this mainly means having UNCLASSIFIED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, and maybe
TOP SECRET data in the database, where not all users are cleared
to the highest security level, and maybe projects X, Y, and Z,
where users of project X may not have a need to know for project Y, etc.
The easy problems are probably solved by now - either you do a good job
of verifying the design and bug-free-ness of your database software
so you can be sure that each request includes, and obeys, security levels,
or you use crypto to encrypt the data items for each security level
(e.g. everybody with a SECRET or PROJECT Z clearance shares a key for that data, which isn't really ideal for non-small groups of people,
the database just tries to do a good job, and you only do operations in
the database that make sense when the data is encrypted, though that's
annoyingly restrictive for many applications.)
The sticky problems are aggregation-related.  It may be ok if an uncleared
person knows that military base A has missile types 1, 3, and 5,
and if the uncleared person knows where all your military bases are.
But is it ok if the uncleared person knows about _all_ the missiles
at _all_ the bases, and can tell that nobody's using Type 2 missiles
any more, and that all the Type 4 missiles got moved to New Jersey last week?
=============== End "Secure Database" section =================
=============== Begin "Real-World and Crypto" section =========
For the average person, though, the simple military models aren't really useful.  You really care more about groups of people,
though the multi-level stuff is sometimes a good way to keep machines from being hacked.  But the real problem is that computers are very good at correlating
information - if two different companies know your Social Security Number,
and they share their data with each other (maybe for a price),
then they can all tie together everything they each know about you.
And there's no way to stop it, except by limiting the information
you give people (which limits the transactions they'll do with you),
or contractually limiting what they can do with it (good luck),
or using multiple identities - and even then, computers are
often good at guessing that the John Doe at 1234 Main Street
is the related to Jane Smith at 1234 Main Street, and maybe the foreign car parts Jane bought on her American Express are
for the Porsche registered to John, so there's a junk-mail opportunity.
There's really only one technology that lets you avoid this,
which is crypto and its relatives - though you still have to get people you use business with to use it, which is an uphill game.
Some of the fundamental work on this is David Chaum's papers
on Credentials without Identity (or something about like that, from ~1985.)
For instance, you can have a voter registration number that's
cryptographically signed by the voting bureau, but uses blinded
signatures so they can't correlate the known good unique number
with the Peter Swire who walked in and showed a picture ID one day.
A driver's license smartcard could keep a pointer to your driving records,
but wouldn't give your True Name, and would only show a cop
that the person whose picture is on the front is a Licensed Driver,
and maybe could demonstrate that the bearer knows the card's PIN.
One big issue is that the government is pushing banks to demand SSNs,
and requiring employers to demand SSNs (makes them easy Employee IDs),
and pushing medical insurers and providers to use SSNs (makes it
easy to collect Medicare data.)  You can gain a lot of privacy
just by having employers use their own employee-ID numbering system,
so the travel agent subcontracting to Corporate Travel
doesn't need your SSN on every form they fill out.
But suppose the Social Security Administration and IRS issued you a bunch
of separate numbers, that were either related using a cryptographic key,
or just randomly picked and kept in a big database (maybe pointing to
your old SSN), so you could give everybody who needs a Tax ID a different
number, and only you and the IRS could correlate them.
(To some extent, you can do this yourself by creating lots of
companies, but it's a real pain and costs a certain amount of money.)
=============== addendum =====================
Of course, for many transactions, the way to reduce the privacy problems
is to use bearer certificates rather than book-entry approaches -
pay cash, or digicash, rather than credit cards, use on-line
anonymous delivery of bits, or picking up stuff in person,
rather than mailing stuff to a snail address, etc.

PDAs are becoming somewhat widespread among technical and sales people,
but there are a lot of different varieties and horsepowers,

Newtons have horsepower, but aren't that common; most of the others
have 8086en or so, including the easily-programmable DOS HPs,
the cool objecty Psion OS, a few different GeoWorks based systems
(is Pilot one of those?), etc.  Then there are a huge number of
totally non-programmable Rolodex/Calendar widgets.
Any of the interesting ones cost too much to go after the
retail market, and they're owned by people who can use email.  For the broad market you want a <=$10 device, and stores grumble if you
charge more than $200 for a really complete reader system -
which means smartcards.  Perhaps once pager capability in PDAs becomes widespread and cheap,
the retail/wholesale pharmaceutical trading set could get interested :-)

If you're doing it as N separate messages, you're using N separate IDEA session keys; IDEA's strong enough that's no risk,
especially since they'll be using separate Initialization Vectors.
If you use the multiple-recipient capability, which uses one copy
of the message encrypted with one session key, and separate headers with
the session key encrypted with each public key.  If PGP didn't take precautions to prevent it, there are attacks on RSA which can be used
when you encrypt the same message with different RSA keys.  However,
PGP pads the session key with different random padding for each
session-key-encrypted-with-public-key header, so they're different messages,
so there's no risk there either.
So don't keep worrying about it; use whichever is more convenient.
(But it was worth worrying about once. :-)

@_subject: Re: Cryptanalysis 
Cryptanalysis of DES is a 25-year ongoing academic exercise, with
lots and lots of results.  It's easy to attack it in 2**55 tries,
because of symmetry, but that's a very large number :-)
Differential cryptanalysis, discovered by Biham and Shamir, shows that the NSA probably did help the design process when
working with IBM to turn IBM's 128-bit-key Lucifer system into DES,
and certainly didn't weaken it.  Linear cryptanalysis, discovered
more recently, shaves some more bits off the strength if you have
an extremely large amount of known plaintext.  Brute-force attacks on DES (just try lots of keys until you win) used to be viewed as almost infeasible, but about 5-6 years ago there were a couple of designs for cracking machines that could do a 1-day crack
for $30-50M, and then Wiener's design for a $1M, 3.5-hour cracking machine
about 5 years ago.  Gate arrays have gotten denser, faster, and cheaper since then, and if you want to crack a _lot_ of keys (e.g. you're the NSA)
you can probably afford to burn ASICs to get even denser and faster.
The slow part of the attack _had_ been key scheduling, but recent work
by Peter Trei and others shows that you can do key scheduling very
efficiently for the brute-force keysearch problem by picking keys
in Gray Code order (since a one-bit change in key causes a simple
change in key-schedule - it's totally useless for normal encryption/
decryption, but it's a big win for brute-force cracks.)  There may be a distributed Internet crack using that approach, though DES is still very inefficient on general-purpose computers and works better on bit-twiddliing chips.
SKIPJACK is a totally different game - the NSA keeps the algorithm secret,
and the only semi-outsiders who've seen it were a group of 5 people
including Dorothy Denning and Dave Maher who were allowed to do a study
when the NSA were trying to foist Clipper onto us.  They concluded that
SKIPJACK was reasonably strong (in their interim report), which gave
them good propaganda points, and never did the "final report" that
was supposed to address the entire Clipper chip (where most of the
technical weaknesses were) and the key-handling charade around it.
I don't remember if Matt Blaze's spoofing attack on the Clipper chip
came before or after their interim report - the checksums were too short
so you could impersonate another chip under reasonably wide conditions.
According to the data sheets for the Mykotronx Clipper Chip, SKIPJACK
is a Feistel-structured cypher with N rounds (I think it was 16 or 32.)
80 bits is enough that if anybody can discover the algorithm, it's too long to brute force today but starts looking pretty vulnerable
in 10-20 years, and of course the Feds would have your keys today,
so they can wiretap you, without needing legal authorization,
and you can probably bribe a Fed faster than you can brute-force the chip.

If I were going to restart a remailer, and to offer news posting,
I'd probably limit it to posting to moderated newsgroups only,
so a human can trash things that look like SPAM or abuse;
the abuse that caused me to kill my remailer wasn't something
a simple filter would catch.  (I'd also prefix each posting with a header about this message having been received from an anonymous source,
not verified, not guaranteed to be worth the electrons it's printed on,
probably not written by anybody whose name's at the bottom, etc....
People don't read mail headers or disclaimers at the bottom,
and putting disclaimers like that into message text for
email exposes the message to traffic analysis.)
Alt.anonymous.messages is an interesting alternative, but one of the ideals of posting news from a remailer is to allow people to broadcast politically incorrect speech anonymously, avoiding censorship
and retribution as much as possible.  This means letting people
call Lee Kwan Yew a fascist, complain that OJ's a space alien,
identify the person Hillary paid to off Vince Foster,
or proclaim that Hubbard's Ahmaddiyya Witnesses are the One True Religion -- Or post the One Page RSA+RC4 to the China newsgroups.
On the other hand, I don't want to support postings titled
"ALL FAGS MUST DIE" with a forged signature and email at the bottom,
and I especially don't want to post that from my remailer without
indicating that anything posted by a remailer might be forged.
That's why I shut down my previous remailer - the forger only
posted one forged message; the person whose name got forged
got flamed severely by dozens of people who objected to "her" posts.
Blocking the gay newsgroups cuts down on that kind of trolling,
but also cuts out the "Help, I might be gay and my parents will kill me"
traffic that remailers are supposed to help with.
On several other hands, though, even if you limit news posting,
trolls can abuse a remailer by sending email to large mailing lists.
It'd certainly never happen to Cypherpunks :-), but some other
mailing lists might attract trolls, and it's not easy to
identify them in advance (though I suppose adding a disclaimer
and cutmarks any time you post to something other than a known remailer is a partial solution.)

back when computers and programs were much smaller; a few PC magazines
tried distributing programs by printing them in the back that way.
Cute, but not cute enough to stick around very long.

Background investigations for defense contractors are handled by DISCO, the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office; I don't know if they
also do internal military clearance work, but I'd assume it's
_somebody_ on the military side rather than FBI, though presumably
the military does also check FBI records (and the FBI probably doesn't
have a blanket policy of always lying to the military :-)
Nuclear clearances presumably go into more depth...
As far as your friend being visited by the FBI several times,
that's obviously part of an ongoing criminal investigation (:-),
so they don't have to tell you.  If they're still thinking about
going back and harassing your friend, it's still ongoing, even if
they now know that he is or is not a Commie Sympathizer.
That, or they could have just been unable to find the records.
Anything computerized should be findable (doesn't mean it _is_,
just that it should be), though they're probably more organized
about finding things they want to find than finding things
you want them to find.  But records that exist only on paper
are a lot tougher to wade through; you can't grep dead trees,
and if your friend was being checked out as "somebody suspicious
who knows somebody we're trying to investigate/harass", the files
may not be indentified under your friend's name, or may be
stored in some big warehouse where nobody's waded through them
in decades.

Suppose you're sending a message on a remailer chain of
you -> Alice->Bob->Charlie->Dave->Eve->Fred--> target
and Bob puts lots of disclaimers in his remailer's outgoing messages.
Anything Bob puts in a header will get stripped out by Charlie,
so it's no problem.  However, if Bob tacks a disclaimer
as the bottom text in the outgoing message, when Eve sends
mail to Fred she'll also see the disclaimer that
so she'll know to check the FBI Illegal Wiretap files for Bob.
Some comments and backtracking
0) Of course, if you want to avoid traffic analysis,
sending unencrypted email is pretty stupid, and only the
next hop is going to see a disclaimer that you append after the encrypted part of the message.
1) Prepending the disclaimer to the message body is
pretty unfriendly to the :: syntax, and not all that
great for PGP encrypted messages either.  Pretend I really just suggested appending it at the end,
since that's what I would have said if I'd been thinking :-)
On the other hand, I suppose that you can see whether the
next hop is a Type I remailer by looking for the :: or 2) Cutmarks would be a nice fix, but they require too much
attention to detail to get right, in case the next hop
is a remailer.
So maybe you _should_ always put in the disclaimer,
at the end, with a reminder to always encrypt your
remailer-chain mail if you want to avoid traffic analysis :-)

You don't bet the bank on 40-bit crypto, unless you're, ummm, accepting credit cards over wimp-configured sessions of SSL.  (You, as merchant,
may not lose if there's a forgery, and your customer's loss may be limited
to $50,
but the bank's loss isn't limited except by how fast they can block thieves.)
While banks get Extra Slack on crypto exports, and can use 56-bit DES,
they've got more serious adversaries - building a $1M machine to win a $1000
contest is a bit expensive for the average grad student, but it's a perfectly reasonable investment if you're planning to rob banks of
millions of dollars with it, especially if you think you can either
siphon the money off slowly while hitting a lot of banks or else
make a really big haul all at once.  Banks aren't the only kind of company with big money floating around;
stockbrokers, commodities traders, purchasing departments of big companies
that might not notice that they're buying a few percent more parts,
and all sorts of other large companies are targets for crypto-cracking
Because well-funded thieves can do this kind of financial damage,
we have a legitimate-sounding spin on "Federal law enforcement's job includes preventing large-scale theft, and they're letting their political agenda
get in the way of doing their job.  Sure, 56-bit keys are harder to crack
than 40,
but well-funded crackers could use the same techniques Ian did."
Either method of theft requires being non-stupid enough not to get caught
afterwards (like the $(24?)M computerized bank job last year), and having your
"partners" not rip you off; a big heist also risks detection by tracking chip
purchases, and
provoking the Feds into banning "ASIC Laundering" and criminalizing illegal possesion of field-programmable gate arrays and such paranoid

@_subject: Privacy Problems with the IAHC New TLD Report SLD Policies 
The International Internet Ad-Hoc Committee released its report
on new Top Level Domains for the Internet.  It's interesting,
and resulted from much political wrangling and religious conflict,
and for the most part I think it's taking a reasonable approach
to the problems, and I'm certainly not going to go postal like
Postmaster Karl Denninger :-)  A few particularly nice features:
Mostly I wasn't worried, because sensible people were going to make sure they didn't do anything totally disastrous.
Apparently I _should_ have been watching more closely, because the SLD
_Second_ Level Domain part has some policies that seriously interfere
with the privacy of potential domain name users.  References and long quotes are below...
To a large extent, they've been trying to avoid getting stuck in
trademark problems by collecting lots of information and defining
jurisdiction.  In the process, they're asking you to sign away your first-born child
in return for getting your name in the Yellow Pages(tm),
and they're requiring all the Registrars to reject your application
unless you do.  The rules are especially inappropriate for the .nom domain,
which is for personal names and such, and don't need overkill.
There's a place for serious high-value commerce behaviour,
and much of this isn't too inappropriate for .firm - but even that
ignores the radical communication-pushed changes in the economy that make everybody able to run a worldwide business. It's not just that they want your email address (highly reasonable)
or your phone and physical address (ought to be optional) or your IP address (they don't ask) or domain name (ok) or digital or written
It's not even just obnoxious things like demanding that you swear (against _my_ religion...) to a bunch of things, like
"the reason for requesting this particular domain name"
or what you're planning to do with the domain name (perfectly reasonable
things to ask for as optional extras, and business may want to reveal these,
but "Decline to State" or "" or "MYOB" are perfectly reasonable responses.)
It's things like designating an agent for service of process, and
"submits to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction and venue of a competent tribunal in the country where the registrar resides".
Aside from believing that you ought to be able to choose what governments,
if any, you're going to subject yourself to, I'd also expect that this
would be
annoying to people who don't live in one of the <=28 countries that
get Registrars in them.  And certainly if you're going to designate
someone as an agent for service of process (you can use the Registrar)
there'd better be some contractual language available so you can tell
what you're swearing to.
Is it reasonable to have a policy that users need to indicate how they'd like to receive communications about name and trademark disputes?
Sure.  And that they hold the Registrar harmless in such disputes?  Probably.
And which dispute resolution organization they're willing to have
resolve disputes over names (a _much_ milder statement than
"submit to personal and subject matter jurisdiction"....)?  Yeah, even if the default is "the Registrar can disconnect your name
if you don't respond to trademark complaints in N days."
Certainly the Registrar ought to have some options here.
======================== REFERENCES ===================================
The Final Report is at The Application Forms for SLDs aren't in the draft on the web page,
Mailing list archives are at 6.1.5 Second-Level Domains
SLD application Application for a second-level domain name must include:      Sufficient contact and intended use information
     Appointment of an agent for service of process
     Agreement to jurisdiction in the event of trademark litigation.
     Mediation and arbitration clause (discussed in a later section) A separate document entitled "SLD Applications" (see section 1.4) contains the information that must be included in a SLD application.
Applications submitted electronically must include state of the art electronic identification; written applications must be signed by the
applicant, if an individual, or by an officer or other legally authorized representative if the applicant is an entity. Renewal and non-use To promote accountability, discourage extortion and minimize obsolete
entries, SLD assignments must be renewed annually. Appendix B, attached, includes the information that must be included in a renewal application. Renewal applications submitted electronically must include state of the art electronic identification; written renewal applications must be signed by the applicant, if an individual, or by an officer or other legally authorized representative if the applicant is an entity. In addition to requiring annual renewal, CORE will develop policies to ensure the recovery of sub-domains which no longer have an
authoritative source (lame delegations). 6.2 Discussion
In order to ensure consistency of basic service across registrars, certain information is required in all applications for SLDs under
gTLDs. It is desirable that a domain name application include sufficient information regarding the applicant and the applicant's intended
use of the domain name to ensure applicant accountability and to ensure that sufficient information is available to enable trademark
owners to assess the need for a challenge to the proposed SLD domain. ================= [more stuff]
7.1.3 Publication
All applications for SLDs in the gTLDs will be published on a publicly available, publicized web site, immediately upon receipt by the registrar. Such publication entries will include:      Name of the SLD;
     Contact and use information contained in the application;
     A permanent tag or label (created by CORE) indicating whether        the applicant chose the option of waiting 60 days prior to
       assignment of the requested SLD or chose to forego the 60 day wait;
     Entry validation using accepted digital signature and timestamping
techniques. Those applicants choosing not to wait will not be in a position to claim the defensive benefit of the waiting period against a challenge,
at any time, by a trademark owner. 11.1 Appendix A - SLD Application Requirements
Every application for assignment of a SLD must include the following elements (incomplete applications must be returned to the applicant for completion):    1.Applicant's name, business or residential address, email address,    2.The state or country of incorporation or partnership (if applicable).    3.The name and address of a designated agent for service of process       in the case of an individual. (The applicant may designate the    4.A sworn statement by the individual applicant or by an officer or         1.that there is a bona fide intent to use the domain name publicly         2.that the domain name will be used for [fill in the blank, e.g.,         3.that the applicant believes that the intended use of the         4.that the reason for requesting this particular domain name is    1.that the applicant submits to the personal and subject matter

That's not really a meaningful question.
We can write codes they can't crack.  They can write codes we can't
The cats are out of the bag, and David Aaron can't herd them back in.
In some sense, the NSA is ahead of academia, because academia publishes,
so they can read everything the Good Guys have done (less six months

but not much - they also see the value of open system review.
And the KGB may have been good as well, but they're not in our face,
and we can write codes the Russians and French can't crack either.)
The NSA has almost certainly done more work on analyzing obscure Russian
cryptosystems, but who knows how much of that is just brute force.
But the real problems these days are engineering, not science*,
so it's probably worth spotting them a few bits of keyspace just in
The NSA is better able to come up with a few million dollars to build
custom key-cracking hardware than industry is, so we have to presume
they can do at least as well as a Wiener machine for cracking DES;
they're certainly better at eavesdropping on calls than we are.
I don't know if we can coordinate more workstations for a distributed
but they _could_ issue the FedCast Secure Screen Saver for all federal
the only question is how much time would it spend cracking keys and
how much grepping for suspicious files :-)  There may still be radical changes in factoring technology, especially as computers get faster,
but I doubt they'll do more in practice than force us to use longer
unless someone proves P=NP in the far mythical future or proves that
factoring is in or near P.
The interesting questions are at the boundaries of strong crypto
and weak crypto - 40 bits is a nasty joke, DES is still interesting
for things that don't have too much money riding on them,
Skipjack is probably strong enough for a few years unless there's a second back door next to the one with the big "Cops Only" neon sign.
How strong can we make something and still get export permission?
Do we care?  What are the threat models for different "Key Recovery"
and are we willing to write deliberatlely weak code to collaborate?
Are the non-RSA public key systems good enough until the patent expires?
There are some boundary problems that are interesting for non-political
reasons - now that every toaster and digital wristwatch has an IP
and a few KB of RAM, what kind of useful crypto will fit in them?
Key distribution is still interesting - how do you make a system that's
convenient enough to use and secure enough to work?  And distributed
cracking systems are interesting, though the main uses for them are
for cracking known-weak cryptosystems.
Then there's the field of secure databases, which I think has both
practical potential and scientific merit - how do you mix data together
without leaking the secure stuff to unauthorized users, either directly
or through combining lots of non-privileged data.

@_subject: Re: lead remailer is shut down 
Most remailers have some basic spam safeguards, typically
how many messages per day or per session or whatever.
They also implement blocking on specific source or destinations,
which makes it easier to stop known spam sources and reduce
hassle for people who don't want to be spammed.
Limited number of posts per source or per destination are less useful,
since people use chained remailers - most messages will have a
remailer as either the source, destination, or both,
so it's fairly common to have lots of messages from one source.
Mass crossposts aren't all that bad; if you're running a decent
newsreader you'll only see that kind of spam once.  The bad ones are
multiple identical or nearly-identical messages posted to one or
a few newsgroups each, which are harder to detect and much more annoying to the reader.  On the other hand, NoCeMs can catch them,
if anybody's sending and using them.
I don't know how many people have the capability to block on Subject:
or message content; I remember getting bouncemails for things that
had variants on M AK E  M O N E Y  F A S T in them, so there are or were
other remailers that block those.
It's hard to find a good definition of spam, and hard to implement it
without keeping lots of extra records you'd probably rather not keep,
and spammers who are willing to do work can find out your limits,
especially if they're in a policy document somewhere, and evade them,
sending as much through each remailer as fits under the radar.
Fortunately, most spammers don't bother.
Back when I was running a remailer, it was a modified Ghio2 version;
I'd fixed some bugs in it, and took the spam detector behavior from
highly rude (shutting itself down quietly) to mildly rude (shutting
itself down noisily); the basic model was to stop entirely under
big spam attacks and let a human fix it up, rather than trying to resolve
them subtlely, which is more appropriate for small spamming.
The advantage of this approach is that you don't have mysterious
message losses; it's all or nothing.  (Well, you still get some mysterious losses, but mostly from bugs or interactions with
other types of remailers.)

For cypherpunks - it's using MDC as its crypto algorithm,
with 160-bit SHA as the hash.  I can't tell if that's the original
SHA or the revised SHA-1.  The readme.txt is adapted from Peter
Gutmann's MDC documentation.   The demo version runs for 21 days,
and doesn't do encryption, so perhaps the real thing is a bit larger.
List price is $149 US.
I couldn't get it to run - I'm using NT 3.51, which you haven't tested
it on, rather than NT 4.0; it complained about not being able to find
Image_List_SetImageCnt in COMCTL32.dll or something like that.
Perhaps that's related to not having installation instructions with the demo?
there's a SecDisk.sys that looks like it wants something done with it...
Or perhaps it's just a 3.51 vs. 4.0 difference.  Oh, well...
I assume it's possible to use this for TEMP directories for
applications like word processors.  I'm not sure I'd want to use
it for swap, but do you know if that would work?

@_subject: Re: Query on "secure databases" 
Hi, Peter - here's my previous posting, with an addendum, Cc: cypherpunks
It's been a long time since I've looked much into it, since I
was getting out of phone-company-defense-contractor mode at the time the
field was developing.  I think the NCSC Rainbow Book that deals
with secure databases is the Purple Book, though it might be the Gray.
Oracle and/or Sybase have done some work trying to do databases
at the B1 or B2 level, but I don't know details.  I'll talk about secure databases a bit, but for the real world
there's more useful stuff that isn't related to them.
=================== Begin "Secure Database" Section ==============
At the time, the Orange Book (security for standalone computers) was well-understood, though there weren't really any systems above B2 level,
and the Red Book was written, but nobody really had a clue how to
implement multi-level machines on a multi-level LAN, though
you could use encrypting Ethernet cards to get single-level machines
of different levels on the same LAN, if they were all administered
by the same group of people (so user-IDs and security levels
worked across the entire system.)  At the lower security levels, Orange Book techniques mainly involve removing bugs and adding accounting features.  At the higher levels, the key is to come up with a good mathematical/logical model of
interactions in your computer system, and then design a computer system
that only does the things permitted by the model and prove it does that.
Some of these systems use cryptographic techniques, including some of
the capability-based systems - see Bill Frantz's KeyKOS work, which he's
referred to on Cypherpunks occasionally. The objective is to have databases that can be accessed by multiple users
with different sets of security permissions.  In the military vernacular,
this mainly means having UNCLASSIFIED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, and maybe
TOP SECRET data in the database, where not all users are cleared
to the highest security level, and maybe projects X, Y, and Z,
where users of project X may not have a need to know for project Y, etc.
The easy problems are probably solved by now - either you do a good job
of verifying the design and bug-free-ness of your database software
so you can be sure that each request includes, and obeys, security levels,
or you use crypto to encrypt the data items for each security level
(e.g. everybody with a SECRET or PROJECT Z clearance shares a key for that data, which isn't really ideal for non-small groups of people,
the database just tries to do a good job, and you only do operations in
the database that make sense when the data is encrypted, though that's
annoyingly restrictive for many applications.)
The sticky problems are aggregation-related.  It may be ok if an uncleared
person knows that military base A has missile types 1, 3, and 5,
and if the uncleared person knows where all your military bases are.
But is it ok if the uncleared person knows about _all_ the missiles
at _all_ the bases, and can tell that nobody's using Type 2 missiles
any more, and that all the Type 4 missiles got moved to New Jersey last week?
=============== End "Secure Database" section =================
=============== Begin "Real-World and Crypto" section =========
For the average person, though, the simple military models aren't really useful.  You really care more about groups of people,
though the multi-level stuff is sometimes a good way to keep machines from being hacked.  But the real problem is that computers are very good at correlating
information - if two different companies know your Social Security Number,
and they share their data with each other (maybe for a price),
then they can all tie together everything they each know about you.
And there's no way to stop it, except by limiting the information
you give people (which limits the transactions they'll do with you),
or contractually limiting what they can do with it (good luck),
or using multiple identities - and even then, computers are
often good at guessing that the John Doe at 1234 Main Street
is the related to Jane Smith at 1234 Main Street, and maybe the foreign car parts Jane bought on her American Express are
for the Porsche registered to John, so there's a junk-mail opportunity.
There's really only one technology that lets you avoid this,
which is crypto and its relatives - though you still have to get people you use business with to use it, which is an uphill game.
Some of the fundamental work on this is David Chaum's papers
on Credentials without Identity (or something about like that, from ~1985.)
For instance, you can have a voter registration number that's
cryptographically signed by the voting bureau, but uses blinded
signatures so they can't correlate the known good unique number
with the Peter Swire who walked in and showed a picture ID one day.
A driver's license smartcard could keep a pointer to your driving records,
but wouldn't give your True Name, and would only show a cop
that the person whose picture is on the front is a Licensed Driver,
and maybe could demonstrate that the bearer knows the card's PIN.
One big issue is that the government is pushing banks to demand SSNs,
and requiring employers to demand SSNs (makes them easy Employee IDs),
and pushing medical insurers and providers to use SSNs (makes it
easy to collect Medicare data.)  You can gain a lot of privacy
just by having employers use their own employee-ID numbering system,
so the travel agent subcontracting to Corporate Travel
doesn't need your SSN on every form they fill out.
But suppose the Social Security Administration and IRS issued you a bunch
of separate numbers, that were either related using a cryptographic key,
or just randomly picked and kept in a big database (maybe pointing to
your old SSN), so you could give everybody who needs a Tax ID a different
number, and only you and the IRS could correlate them.
(To some extent, you can do this yourself by creating lots of
companies, but it's a real pain and costs a certain amount of money.)
=============== addendum =====================
Of course, for many transactions, the way to reduce the privacy problems
is to use bearer certificates rather than book-entry approaches -
pay cash, or digicash, rather than credit cards, use on-line
anonymous delivery of bits, or picking up stuff in person,
rather than mailing stuff to a snail address, etc.

PDAs are becoming somewhat widespread among technical and sales people,
but there are a lot of different varieties and horsepowers,
and some are generally programmable with near-free-ware while others aren't.
Newtons have horsepower, but aren't that common; most of the others
have 8086en or so, including the easily-programmable DOS HPs,
the cool objecty Psion OS, a few different GeoWorks based systems
(is Pilot one of those?), etc.  Then there are a huge number of
totally non-programmable Rolodex/Calendar widgets.
Any of the interesting ones cost too much to go after the
retail market, and they're owned by people who can use email.  For the broad market you want a <=$10 device, and stores grumble if you
charge more than $200 for a really complete reader system -
which means smartcards.  Perhaps once pager capability in PDAs becomes widespread and cheap,
the retail/wholesale pharmaceutical trading set could get interested :-)

If you're doing it as N separate messages, you're using N separate IDEA session keys; IDEA's strong enough that's no risk,
especially since they'll be using separate Initialization Vectors.
If you use the multiple-recipient capability, which uses one copy
of the message encrypted with one session key, and separate headers with
the session key encrypted with each public key.  If PGP didn't take precautions to prevent it, there are attacks on RSA which can be used
when you encrypt the same message with different RSA keys.  However,
PGP pads the session key with different random padding for each
session-key-encrypted-with-public-key header, so they're different messages,
so there's no risk there either.
So don't keep worrying about it; use whichever is more convenient.
(But it was worth worrying about once. :-)

@_subject: Re: Cryptanalysis 
Cryptanalysis of DES is a 25-year ongoing academic exercise, with
lots and lots of results.  It's easy to attack it in 2**55 tries,
because of symmetry, but that's a very large number :-)
Differential cryptanalysis, discovered by Biham and Shamir, shows that the NSA probably did help the design process when
working with IBM to turn IBM's 128-bit-key Lucifer system into DES,
and certainly didn't weaken it.  Linear cryptanalysis, discovered
more recently, shaves some more bits off the strength if you have
an extremely large amount of known plaintext.  Brute-force attacks on DES (just try lots of keys until you win) used to be viewed as almost infeasible, but about 5-6 years ago there were a couple of designs for cracking machines that could do a 1-day crack
for $30-50M, and then Wiener's design for a $1M, 3.5-hour cracking machine
about 5 years ago.  Gate arrays have gotten denser, faster, and cheaper since then, and if you want to crack a _lot_ of keys (e.g. you're the NSA)
you can probably afford to burn ASICs to get even denser and faster.
The slow part of the attack _had_ been key scheduling, but recent work
by Peter Trei and others shows that you can do key scheduling very
efficiently for the brute-force keysearch problem by picking keys
in Gray Code order (since a one-bit change in key causes a simple
change in key-schedule - it's totally useless for normal encryption/
decryption, but it's a big win for brute-force cracks.)  There may be a distributed Internet crack using that approach, though DES is still very inefficient on general-purpose computers and works better on bit-twiddliing chips.
SKIPJACK is a totally different game - the NSA keeps the algorithm secret,
and the only semi-outsiders who've seen it were a group of 5 people
including Dorothy Denning and Dave Maher who were allowed to do a study
when the NSA were trying to foist Clipper onto us.  They concluded that
SKIPJACK was reasonably strong (in their interim report), which gave
them good propaganda points, and never did the "final report" that
was supposed to address the entire Clipper chip (where most of the
technical weaknesses were) and the key-handling charade around it.
I don't remember if Matt Blaze's spoofing attack on the Clipper chip
came before or after their interim report - the checksums were too short
so you could impersonate another chip under reasonably wide conditions.
According to the data sheets for the Mykotronx Clipper Chip, SKIPJACK
is a Feistel-structured cypher with N rounds (I think it was 16 or 32.)
80 bits is enough that if anybody can discover the algorithm, it's too long to brute force today but starts looking pretty vulnerable
in 10-20 years, and of course the Feds would have your keys today,
so they can wiretap you, without needing legal authorization,
and you can probably bribe a Fed faster than you can brute-force the chip.

Sure, up to 128 bits of entropy.  Go check out pgpcrack.  Suppose you wanted to do a brute-force attack on a PGP conventionally
encrypted document, and you knew the passphrase was one character long.
What would you do?  How many tries would it take to be sure you
got the right passphrase?
Suppose you knew the passphrase was one word in a common on-line dictionary.
What would you do, and how many tries would it take?
Since the passphrase is MD5-hashed to a 128-bit-long key, there are only
2**128 really-different passphrases, though for any given passphrase,
most of the members of the infinitely large class of equivalent passphrases
won't be very easy to remember :-)  Since MD5 is cryptographically strong,
we used to assume it would be hard to find those equivalence classes,
though Dobbertin's work suggests it's not as hard to find collisions as we
used to assume.

@_subject: Re: Interesting question: how to safely keep passwords online 
Depends on your threat models....
The relatively safe way is to use an encrypted disk volume,
so everything stored on it is "safe", though any time the disk volume is open, you're obviously at risk.  My laptop is
relatively secure, unless someone has physical access to it;
if I used a boot password and encrypted disk volume it would require
an active attack to get the information, rather than simple theft.
(NT has a password, but it's not worth much if you've got the disk.)
Another popular approach, which PGP uses for storing private keys,
is to store the keys in an encrypted file, and use a passphrase for access;
variants include one passphrase for the whole file, or one passphrase
per record.  Of course, if you can replace the "PGP" program with a
trojan version, you can still steal the passphrase.  Or you can use a
keystroke sniffer to store any password-like input.
Of course, an even more popular approach is to ignore the problem,
and just leave the password around in plaintext in an INI file or Registry,
or encrypt it with some Really Secure KeyLess Proprietary Algorithm,
like rot13 ("We'll fool them - we'll use rot39!  It's 3 times as secure!")
If you've got off-machine storage, e.g. a SecureID-like calculator
or other smartcard with on-card PIN entry, you can do actual security.
Even then you need to be careful about all the protocols; it doesn't do
much good to have a 4096-bit RSA key if a trojan shim can replace the card's
response of "Not OK" with "OK" before the real application reads it.

It's nice to know that the NSA's own government hasn't trusted Clipper
enough to widely adopt it, and I was as impressed as you were with
Walker's sleaziness...  Either the civilian Feds don't believe the "legitimate needs of law enforcement" apply to them, or they don't trust the spooks to handle their keys carefully, or (more likely) there aren't
any Clipper products that really meet their operational needs.  Back when the STU-III was still called the "Future Secure Voice System"
the DoD was telling manufacturers they'd probably sell 500,000 of them,
between the DoD unclassified work, law enforcement users, defense contractors, and similar riff-raff.  I don't know how many were actually sold, but I'd be surprised if it's a tenth of that; the government
was too cheap to spend $2-3K per box for that many users.
"Key Recovery" is a broader and sleazier term than "key escrow";
it doesn't force you to buy a specific espionage-enabled product,
as long as you can demonstrate to the government that they can break in.
Rot13 and RC4/40 inherently provide key recovery (:-),
and DES presumably does (using NSA custom hardware).  But PGP also gives you key recovery - just Cc: your Trusted Third Party whenever you encrypt something......  (Hmmm.  I don't trust the
Democrat or Republican Parties - guess that leaves the Libertarians? :-)

Gutmann's MDC documentation.   The demo version runs for 21 days,

List price is $149 US.
I couldn't get it to run - I'm using NT 3.51, which you haven't tested
it on, rather than NT 4.0; it complained about not being able to find
Image_List_SetImageCnt in COMCTL32.dll or something like that.
Perhaps that's related to not having installation instructions with the demo?
there's a SecDisk.sys that looks like it wants something done with it...
Or perhaps it's just a 3.51 vs. 4.0 difference.  Oh, well...

There may be separate restrictions on sending it, or on copying,

At 09:58 AM 7/15/96 -0400, about six months ago, when Clipper III was new,
Unfortunately, the Government hasn't given up on this one;
Peter Gutman's recent articles on export policy in New Zealand and
Australia suggest that Our Public Servants are trying an end-run
by getting those countries to stop export and development by productive crypto authors, targeting the toolkits that are being widely used
inside and outside the US.
Yeah.  I haven't heard much from Clipper III recently,
since they've been trumpeting Clipper IV "Key Recovery" recently,
but that doesn't mean it's not going on.  Unlike politican efforts
such as Key Recovery, infrastructure attacks such as PKI
may require long-term technical development - the Cooperative
Research and Development Alliances (CRADAs) are not just to
bribe otherwise-valuable companies to stay out of the way,
they're to do things that may be sprung on us later;
I'd predict this coming summer.  For instance, back in July,
John Young quoted a Business Wire article about
 =  Toronto -- Certicom Corp. a leading information security  =  company, today announced that it will participate in an  =  initiative by the U.S. Commerce Department's National  =  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) which will  =  lead to the development of the elements of a public key  =  infrastructure (PKI).  Certicom are the folks who do Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems,
which haven't been used much due to patent questions and RSA's dominance, but which allow much shorter public keys
and may have some speed advantages, both of which are
quite important for smartcard use.
It failed, and they've now got an Ambassador strong-arming other countries
to prohibit export.
Yeah.  Clipper IV is getting a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon
to get export permission for their 56-bit software.  Many of the people
who are most vocal about it are the usual suspects anyway, but it's
closer to commercial usability that industry's more cooperative this round,
especially with more Internet money fever.

mainly to cut down on volume but also because I was getting fed up
with Vulis's attacks through remailers, which were getting to be
too much trouble to filter out.  I switched back to the main list

PGP 2.5 became a non-issue because RSAREF takes care of the patent problem -
which is largely because the widespread use of PGP really did spread the RSA algorithm's popularity, and giving away free licenses was about the only

Sorry for the delay; it's been a busy week.  I'll forward you a couple of articles that have come out recently.  The original Cypherpunks archive is on which has good stuff though it hasn't been updated recently.
Tim May's Cyphernomicon is a great summary, available in one or more pieces.
Cypherpunks started as a discussion group, which became a mailing list,
for people interested in cryptographic and computer techniques for protecting privacy; if you can convince the government to pass laws protecting privacy, or refrain from passing laws attacking it,
you're only protected until the next Congresscritter or bureaucrat feels like writing a new law - but if you develop and publish software that
lets you protect your conversations with strong crypto, they're secure
until the laws of mathematics change (happens occasionally :-).
"Cypherpunks write code."  Cypherpunks also debug code - sometimes
your crypto software is only secure until the next implementation bug
gets found.  Some of the interesting work that cypherpunks have done
has been popularizing and enhancing PGP, developing remailers,
cracking 40-bit crypto and other weak government-imposed limits,
finding bugs in the Clipper chip, and finding bugs in Netscape and MSIE.
A perennial topic is digital cash, which is an important part of a
free economy in cyberspace, and many cypherpunks have either worked on,
or with, or around (:-) David Chaum's Digicash company; Getting on the list - the list used to be on toad.com, but has
since migrated to several places, which will eventually be gatewayed together

a better term for pointing tens of thousands of warheads at your enemies,
while they have tens of thousands of them pointed at you, and both of you are

Ecological holocaust?  Nuclear winter was disbelieved, though I did know a meteorologist whose doctoral thesis advisor was working on germ warfare dispersal modelling, and The Customer didn't think in terms of genocide, just "nuking them till they glow" and "making the rubble bounce" and
"pre-emptive strikes".

what this sort of behaviour would do to the Phone Company, and how to
let the military get useful phone services pre-, trans-, and post-attack,

@_subject: Re: UK to ban free use of crypto? 
The document is at And Michael Froomkin offers similar sentiments.  They're both lawyers,
and I'm not (:-), so they're expected to do a better job of reading
the legal parts of it.  On the other hand, the DTI says:
and it's got a really broad definition of "encryption services",
including even things such as time-stamping.
The big problem is that the document has a really warped view of the cryptographic and business services that a "Trusted Third Party" would provide, and some parts are expressed in quite broad language.
For instance, it implies that the TTP is being trusted with private keys,
otherwise there would be no way for it to recover anything.
On the other hand, from their Q&A:
If the TTP is not encrypting the data, they don't need the secret key
or your private key.  They DO need your public key, to sign it, so a second party can trust that a key they have is really yours.
But you and the second party can use the signed keys to exchange a
secret session key, or to sign documents, without the TTP's help.*
So their primary description of what a TTP would do does not involve escrow.
Keys are used for three things - communications, signatures, and storage.
As discussed above, for communications, the TTP doesn't need your private key,
and there's no business need for anyone to have the keys to decode a communication unless they already have the cyphertext.  Business applications
that do require a third party to have a copy of your _message_ can be
met by sending them a copy of your message, encrypted with their key,
and the document explicitly says it's not talking about them.
Similarly, cell-phone companies are providing encryption and routing,
so this document claims not to be about them, though it regulates them.
The only third parties who need just the session key itself are
eavesdroppers and forgers, who are Untrusted Third Parties.
For signatures, there's also _never_ a need for the third party to
have the private keys - the function you Trust the Third Party to do
is to certify that the holder of the key either is who he claims to be
or has the permissions he claims to have (e.g. to write purchase orders
or sign contracts for Company X.)  And the document even states that
"There is, of course no intention for the Government to access private keys
used for only integrity functions."
The main time you want another party to have a copy of your keys
is for stored data:  to cover the "employee dies" case (the document explicitly permits companies to handle their own keys without regulation, so no TTP is needed here), and the "you die, and your family digicash is in your encrypted file system" case,
for which you can give a copy of your key to your spouse or solicitor,
or keep it on a floppy in your bank safe deposit box, all of which cases
are presumably covered by current law in the UK just as they are in the US.
SO - what _is_ all this malarkey about "legal access" and "key recovery"
and "key escrow" systems?  The document claims repeatedly that it's not
purporting to regulate any of the conditions under which a Third Party
would ever be Trusted with the keys you actually encrypted something with.
There's a whole lot of material about restricting who can be in the
business and offer these services, seemingly designed to either
restrict the emergence of new services or to be later expanded to cover
other parts of the encryption business, such as supplying encryption software.
And it's very unclear about whether it covers the encryption services
used in inter-corporate projects such as Mondex - as a stockholder and
customer of some of those companies, this concerns me.
In particular, the expansion appears to be targeted specifically at the UK end of the Stronghold Apache-SSL web server, Adam Back's RSA Munitions
the PGP and Crypto Software distribution site at Oxford, and Ross Anderson.
[*There are non-public-key systems where the TTP handles the secret keys,
but they're typically older or specialized military or banking systems,
where the TTP isn't an independent party, and are generally superseded by
public-key systems now that the technology is practical.]

@_subject: Re: American Registry for Internet Numbers? 
I'm not sure how credible it is.  However, a proposal to pay for
IP addresses now would be really bad timing.  The reason is that
sometime soon the net is going to change to IPv6.  It's not clear when,
given some of the stopgap measures to get by with existing IP space,
but it will probably be within the next 2-3 years.
There are three main differences between IPv6 and the current IPv4
1) It's different, so you need to upgrade your routers and machines,
2) IPSEC security feature support is mandatory, so various government
3) Addresses are 128 bits long instead of 32 bits.   32 bits is 	4 billion, which would be enough for almost everybody on the planet to have one (except that the addressing structure wastes part of the space.)
64 bits is almost enough for everyone on the planet to have
a network number with a host number for everyone else.
It's almost enough for every human neuron on the planet to have an address.
128 bits is far, far larger than that.  Even if we waste lots of space
by using an inefficient structure, which we will to make routing easier,
there's still mindbogglingly more space than anyone needs.
There are two reasons to charge for Internet numbers:
1) Even if you've got nearly infinite supplies, somebody still
needs to coordinate it to prevent collisions, and this has non-zero cost.
2) Today, numbers are in short supply, so charging for them can
help reduce waste and bring in revenue for the lucky contractor,
especially if you charge by the address or size of address block.
Tomorrow, there are so many numbers that charging by the number
doesn't make sense - all you need is an initial coordination cost.
So if you want to make big bucks on this business tomorrow,
you'd better get the market locked in today.
There are alternative approaches that don't even require a registry.
For example, divide the address space into a 48-bit host part
(Ethernet numbers are unique) and an 80-bit network part,
and just pick a random network part.  On the average, the probability
of collisions is very low unless 2**40 other people are playing,
and you can put all the machines you want on that network.
If that's not guaranteed enough for you, you could use an
Ethernet board number as the network number (even if your
network isn't Ethernet based, you can buy a $50 board :-)
To put costs in perspective, the last time I checked, the Ethernet
industry charged manufacturers $1000 for a 24-bit chunk of numbers,
and there are 2**23 chunks available; there are very few manuacturers
who'll ever need to buy a second chunk, and not many manufacturers,
so this relatively high price is reasonable.  On the other hand,
if somebody wanted to set up a web-based registry of IPv6 numbers,
they could dole them out for a few dollars per chunk, most of which
would be spent on billing.  Perhaps the Ethernet folks could sell
IPv6 registry space for $1000/registry?
A bit of initial coordination can set aside different parts of the
number space for different strategies, and let the market settle it. #			Thanks;  Bill

perspective, the important impediments to running remailers are
(1) mail recipients hate you and send lots of complaints and
(1a) usenet readers hate you and send lots of complaints Andy's model of a remailer in which the remailer sends the recipient a delivery notice with a disclaimer/waiver/etc. and the recipient returns
it to pick up the message raises the level of politeness and lowers
the amount of surprise compared to current remailers, so it's a potentially big win.  If I start up a remailer again some year,
other than a middleman, it'll definitely need this kind of feature.
Building the positive public reputation of remailers and remailer
operators is a critical part of keeping the remailer system running,
at least as much as convenient, widely-deployed software.
For posting to Usenet, the "we have an anonymous posting, anybody want it"
approach doesn't sound highly practical, though it could be done,
but I'd probably limit postings to moderated newsgroups (where a human
will be filtering out the blatant spam and abuse) and flame-tolerant
newsgroups like alt.anonymous.messages and alt.flames.  I find this
highly frustrating, since one of the big wins about remailers is posting to talk.politics.* and alt.religion.scientology and other
groups where posting your opinion with your name on it may be unsafe.
There's also the problem of publishing acceptable newsgroup lists,
since failing messages silently is unfriendly to users, but there's a traffic analysis problem (Bad Guys can watch who fetches
remailer use policies and build up their dossiers.)
Most of the problem with (2) Third Parties _can_ be helped a bit by
disclaimers, by plausible deniability, by not having logs to subpoena,
and by having remailers that you're willing to shut down with profuse
apologies to head off lawsuits.  It isn't a perfect job if someone
really wants to go for blood by making you defend repeated lawsuits
(especially if they're really targeting you, e.g. posting their
Secret Documents through your remailer themselves to entrap you.)
But it'll let most remailer users defend against most reasonable I do also agree with Greg that getting the sender of a message to
indemnify you isn't worth the recycled electrons used for the
log file you aren't keeping.  That's especially the case if
you're forwarding messages received from other remailers,
unless you can get other remailer operators to indemnify you,
in return for which you'd probably have to indemnify them.  No thanks.

have. for Ann, subsidiaries For instance, patients using Ann's services pay their money to
Alice's Anguillan Health Care Clinic, Ltd., which just happens to have a branch employing Ann at some vaguely plausible salary.
Either her salary is enough to keep the IRS relatively non-suspicious,
which works even if Alice's Clinic gets paid by government-regulated
insurance plans, at the cost of some taxes, or she's paid piece-rates (perhaps below market, or perhaps cash patients don't always get recorded.)
Perhaps Sister Ann has taken a vow of poverty and the IRS believes her?*
Perhaps Ann's rent is paid to a company that's really owned by Alice's?
Does Ann really own Alice's Clinic?  Most of this is standard non-crypto
tax avoidance stuff, but digicash and encrypted records and communications
make it a bit more private and convenient.
Also, there _is_ a business for cash-paying customers, who may choose
to retain their anonymity, either taking their medical records with them
on smartcards, or being treated under aliases - poor people who don't
have insurance, non-insured privacy enthusiasts, people worried about
socially awkward diseases, people with gunshot wounds they don't want to

At 11:19 AM 3/31/97 -0500, Ray Arachelian forwarded:
This is almost certainly the RC4/40 crack in August 1995 by
Damien Doligez in response to Hal Finney's challenge.
It had actually been broken a few hours earlier by an
English (Anglo-American?) team using a coordinated
Internet attack, but Damien noticed his success before
they noticed theirs.  Much noise was made in the press by
various people about "Using $10,000 worth of supercomputer time",
but in fact the antique KSR-1 contributed far less crunching than
the bunch of DEC Alpha workstations, and the amount of money
per crack (if you'd been renting computer time) would have been
far less.  Subsequent cracks were run by the Internet team,
which ran even faster, once they were organized.
Various Cypherpunks were quoted in the press talking about
how the US export laws were bogus, and how the maximum-strength
crypto allowed by US law could be broken by a grad student over
a weekend.
Since then, there have been other cracks - the RC5/40 crack by
Ian Goldberg took 3.5 hours on a Network of Workstations at Berkeley,
winning the RSA challenge a few minutes before Germano Caronni's
distributed Internet team, which subsequently broke the RC5/48 challenge.
It's been popular in the press to refer to these talented researchers as
"a grad student" when trying to make the point that "anybody could
break this wimpy stuff" or as "a university research team with a room full of expensive supercomputers" when trying to pretend
the export limits are reasonable for the real world.
The news article below is from "NB", presumably "NewsBytes",
and was posted without permission to the cypherpunks list
by an anonymous remailer user.
Netscape Encrypted Data Cracked
Tokyo, Japan, Aug. 18 (NB) -- Two computer users have
managed to break Netscape's Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
encryption code in response to a challenge posted to the
Internet. But far from scaring people away from using the
system for online purchases, the results could reassure
people of the safety.
In mid July Hal Finney, a US computer user, posted data
in an Internet message that he recorded when he sent an
order, containing a fake name and credit card details, to
Netscape's own computer. Setting a task for the hacking
community, he wrote, "The challenge is to break the
encryption and recover the name and address info I
entered in the form and sent securely to Netscape."
Early this week, news came from Damien Doligez, a French
computer user, that he had cracked the code and revealed
the contents of the message. Several hours later a
message from an American team also claimed the same feat,
actually cracking it two hours earlier than Doligez.
While the results look damaging on the surface, Netscape,
and Doligez, pointed out the amount of computer
processing power needed to hack just one message and the
difficulty in repeating the process.
Roseanne Siino of Netscape told Newsbytes, "The real
issue is whether this compromises security on the net. He
used 120 computers for 8 days just to crack one message."
Siino points out that to break into another message would
require another eight days at the same 120 workstations
and 2 parallel computers.
In home computer terms, Doligez guesses a network of
about 80 Intel Pentium-based machines would be equivalent
to the system he had access to via his workplace, INRIA
in Paris, and computers an Ecole Polytechnique and ENS.
Netscape estimates the total cost of this computing time
at around $10,000, meaning there are many more economical
ways of getting credit cards numbers than hacking into
Netscape SSL messages.
Doligez agrees, writing on his home page: "The technical
implications are almost zero. Everybody who understands
the technical details knew perfectly well that this was
do-able and even easy. You have to understand what
happened exactly. I did not break SSL itself. I did only
break one SSL session that used the weakest algorithm
available in SSL. If I want to break another session, it
will cost another 8 days of all my machines."
The vulnerability of the encryption system is shown by
its international use. The coding system available via
Netscape software from the Internet makes use of a 40-bit
encryption key. A stronger version, using a 128-bit key,
is available to US citizens but restricted from export
outside the United States by government regulations.
Netscape's Siino explained the US government allows
export of the lower security version "because they can
break it."
There are some hopes that this demonstration will help
persuade the US government to lift export restrictions on
some harder-to-crack versions of the code.
Netscape is currently developing a new Secure Courier
code which just encrypts the financial data in the
messages using 56-bit keys. Siino explained, "You can
export over 40-bit keys for a specific application." The
new system should be available early next year.
Many companies working on secure transaction systems hope
the much more secure 128-bit code version of the system
will be available for export eventually. This is said to
be almost unbreakable, requiring a trillion times more
processing power to crack than the 40-bit version.
Internet users can view a copy of the original challenge,
access Doligez's home page with details of his result,
get copies of the program used to crack the code and read
Netscape's response to the news through a special section

@_subject: Re: remailer spam throttle 
Typical remailers carry maybe 100-500 messages/day;
typical messages run 1-20KB unless they're pictures or warez.
That's about 1-10MB/day of traffic.  If you keep it 7 days,
that's up to 70 MB storage, which you'd probably keep in /tmp
to avoid backups and maybe avoid disk quotas.
If you're running it on your own desktop machine, that's small;
it's a bit large for a laptop, and whether it's reasonable for an
ISP shell account depends a lot on your ISP's policies and disk quotas
(and /tmp clearing policies.)
But you don't have to explain it to the LEA - you may have to
explain it to a court, but you get to bring along a lawyer.
It's not contempt if you're telling the truth (that you can't decrypt it.)
On the other hand, if you're using a two-part key (one sent to the
recipient, one kept in transient memory on your machine plus in your head),
you _do_ get to explain to the judge why you're refusing to testify,
and why the ECPA protects the privacy of all the messages that
may be revealed if you release your half of the key,
and why you need sworn testimony from the LEAs about exactly which
messages they've eavesdropped besides the ones addressed to their target,
and about why giving them the key would violate the privacy of
the recipients of those other messages so they can't have it,
but you also refuse to decrypt the ones for the victim yourself,
at least without a direct court order (as opposed to a mere warrant) -
_then_ you'll have the opportunity to get close to contempt of court :-)
If the "random" key includes a part you know as well as a part
the user knows, and the user's part not only includes a hash of
the message (so you need to know the contents of the message to
recreate the session key) but also the usual things like the
system clock to the microsecond and the contents of the rand pool,
and maybe a few hits from /dev/random - then it's perfectly fine
to tell them.
I'd agree, but from the first anonymous remailers open to the public
there were people who didn't like receiving anonymous mail :-)
That's an interesting approach - a bit extreme, but the main cypherpunks
applications for anonymous remailers are things like whistleblowing
(which can be posted to the net or emailed to people like Foo Inspectors
who _ought_ to be willing to accept anonymous mail) and potential
co-conspirators (who _ought_ to be willing to accept it if they're
interested in co-conspiring), and of course yourself under various aliases.
A nice touch.

Yeah, but they're a moderately useful kluge in that they
let you separate the information about how to find an anonymous recipient
into at least two places, which is far more secure than just one.
They're relatively annoying to use, but the nymserver approach
makes it possible to use them without the average user messing
with the details.
Is this a distributed-commercial-remailer-boxes approach, or something different?  It's a hard problem to do right.
In a large-scale system, one good design is to have a Pipenet
or equivalent that's used to pick up POP-mail.  It needs enough
traffic/users/bandwidth to achieve Obscurity, but if you could
convince people to carry their Usenet feeds as cover traffic,
that'd be more than enough :-)  Store-and-forward variants are
less reliable, but may do a good enough job, or I suppose you
could cook up some sort of distributed message pools.

It's been a busy day for privacy issues in the Oakland Trib.
Surveillance Cameras in Oakland
Remember FileGate, with the White House accessing confidential background files of hundreds of Republican Administration workers?  Remember Craig Livingstone, White House staffer who resigned after it was revealed that his office was responsible for it?
Well, he was never charged with anything, but he had about $9550 in legal expenses to advise him when he talked to Congress,
and apparently 55 of his good friends decided to help him out.
Hillary Clinton's chief of staff gave $50, Bill Clinton's golf partner
Vernon Jordan gave $250, D.C.City Council member Charlene Davis gave $100,
and overall it averaged out to about $200 per insider.
Petty cash, perhaps, but it goes to show you the Clinton Administration's
attitudes toward violation of privacy and abuse of power.
Needless to say, the Associated Press story was a bit more balanced in tone
than my summary here :-)
And in other news, San Leandro High School students, mostly the drama club,
led a protest against against a proposed school board policy that would ban
profanity, obscenity, libel, or slanderous speech in school-produced
publications and productions.  (Out, Out,  spot!)
"We want to be able to have the plays we've had in the past", said Sean
"We're not doing profanity, we're doing ideas."  Last year the drama department canceled a production of "The Breakfast Club", though it was
allowed to go on with modified language.

I'd find this fairly surprising, though the Fedz can obviously
get it by subpoena or warrant if they feel like it.
However, notice that most hotels you stay in want to know
your name, address, company, etc.  Some of it's for marketing reasons
(so they can sell your name to advertisers), but I'd guess that
in many jurisdictions there are legal requirements to collect it.
Otherwise, all your basic motel needs to check is that the
cash or credit card you pay them in advance is good (if it's not,
they can evict you). (Modulo a few phone bills.)
Immediate clearing works fine, no need for book entry or names.
Of course, there are countries where they want to see your
Citizen-Unit ID Card, or else your passport, and if you're a
foreigner they'll keep your passport overnight to register it with
the police.  GAK...

@_subject: [Key Markets] Re: "...markets are fundamentally chaotic, not efficient"? 
Crispin and Hettinga discussing efficient markets for key bailment:
We're not talking about a lot of bits, here.
If you take care of the hard problem, which is getting people to hand their keys over to easily located key baliffs for no good business reason,
the amount of retrieval work is really a lot smaller than the work of wiretapping all the communications and selecting targets.
If the government expects to get the key owners to pay for bailment,
and get retrievals for free in return for paper copies of warrants
blue-ink-signed by judges, in triplicate, with hand-pressed notary seals,
yes, that'd be a bottleneck.  On the other hand, if the key bailiffs
accept electronic requests, digitally signed by the judge's key,
with electronic payment attached (whether DigiCash or EscrowBucks),
the costs of the key bailment service are quite low and the profit on
each request makes it worthwhile to expand the business to meet rapidly-increasing demand - cheap enough to the government to make it
worth wiretapping more encrypted transactions.   Since the Secretary gets to approve Key Recovery Agent Parties,
he can disavow all knowledge of agents who insist on a real signature
and want to be sure the request was signed by a real judge rather than
by some clerk or cop using the Escrowed copy of the judge's key.

@_subject: Re: "...markets are fundamentally chaotic, not efficient"? Really? 
Kent and Bob have been huffing and puffing and blowing each others's
straw men down for a few stochastically-determined rounds....
By that definition, markets, whether for capital or assassins, are distinctly _not_ chaotic*, since most people's decisions
about what stocks to buy/sell, and particularly the timing,
are influenced by lots of random events - when they hear what information,
whether they were busy doing something else when they heard, whether they'd just blown their disposable income on a new car
because that freak windstorm dropped a tree on their car the same
week the Post Office ate their car insurance payment, whether Alan Greenspan had a bad pizza the night before the quarterly interest rates came out or too much caffeine before his latest speech....
Much of the market is driven by the large institutional trading houses,
and increasingly by their computer models, but a lot of it's random,
and those functions that are chaotic are driven by random inputs.
To the extent that the interactions are chaotic rather than linear,
it is hard to develop good models of what the market might do and squeeze a few more bits of predictive information out of the vast quantity of observable random data; even with good computer models
and Nuclear Physics PhDs on Wall Street there'll probably always be
enough inefficiency left in the market for people to squeeze a few
more megabucks worth of arbitrage out of it.
[Of course, one of the most effective ways to make money in the market
has always been to provide high-priced (or low-priced high-volume)
investment advice to investors - and chaos theory has contributed
not only to the profitability of some investors but to the
buzzword-supply of hucksters in many fields, and selling buzzwords
can make a lot of short-term money...]
The one physicist I knew well who went to Wall Street did it during
the stock market boom of 1987.  (Oops...)  He was fortunate to avoid getting caught in one of the major fallouts of the '87 stock crash,
which was the '87-'88 stock market job crash, though.
The standard way to prove that a market is inefficient is to
go tap some money out of it.  Doing so does eliminate that particular
inefficiency after a while, but there keep being enough people
employed on Wall Street to suggest that there's always inefficiency.
I didn't come here for an argument....

Interesting paper.  I was surprised it didn't explicitly mention Plan 9

it talked about the kind of world where you can just buy a computer,

One major problem with these features is that the security
implications become far more complex when you start combining them.
For instance, autoloading images without referer are safe - but
images + referer gives enough information to run doubleclick.
Cookies without referer are pretty safe - but cookies+referer
make cookies far less safe, and doubleclick more effective.
Then you start putting HTML capability in news readers,
and anybody who reads an article with an IMG in it
creates a record for spammers (or Arbitron) to use.
Rich Graves said that if you don't like the feature, take it up with the folks who wrote the spec - but the RFCs say that Referer needs to
be handled carefully, and should be optional...
Perhaps too much commercial advertising capability already depended on it?

The fact that the USSR only exists in the past should be just fine for
some of these people, who'd also rather live in the past :-)
Same as it ever was - J. Edgar Hoover and Joe McCarthy weren't much different
from Louis Freeh or Ollie North today, or than the thugs who drafted people into the wars of 1846, the 1860s, 1917-18, the 1940s, 1950s, or 1960s, or the
thugs who arrested Schenck for speaking against the draft in 1916 before there
even was a draft...  Perhaps they were a bit more aggressive than Louis, but Louis's got the advantage of better hardware, and Moore's Law is unfortunately on the side of the surveillance state.
If Harry Anslinger wanted to wiretap a Demon Rum Dealer, he needed guys
to listen to the tap, though perhaps wire recorders could help,
and any recordkeeping correlation was done by people and dead-tree machinery.
If J.Edgar wanted to wiretap a Commie, he could use voice-activated tape recorders, but it was still analog, and still needed people to interpret it,
though records like names of important convicts and Commies could be kept in big expensive mainframes.  If either one wanted to read your mail, the Post Office would be happy to pick it out for them, and they could steam open the envelope if you weren't taking advantage of the Post Office's
cheaper rate for unsealed envelopes.
Back in the early 80s, if you wanted to store 1 byte of information for
every American adult, you either needed a high-end magtape (160MB)
which used a $30-50K tape drive, for slow retrievals, or a fast removable
disk pack ($1000 for 250MB) which also needed a $35K disk drive.
This meant that large-scale data on the population was mainly used by
people who were making money out of it, and governments mainly focused on
a million or so usual suspects because it was too much trouble to do more.
Now $30 will get you a CDROM with 100 million phone numbers on it,
$300 will get you a 3GB of hard disk (still only 10 bytes/person),
or a disk drive holding 500MB removables, a 4GB tape drive is probably $1000,
and your original $30K will probably get you a few terabytes worth of
tape stacker capacity - if not today, then next year.  That means that
not only can Louis Freeh keep data on everybody, but just about anybody
can afford to, and it's increasingly possible to keep it in random-access
forms like disk drives which can be correlated much more easily than tapes.
Optical scanners are getting cheap - paper won't be just dead trees much
[If I mention video cameras I'll start sounding depressingly like David
Brin :-)
Of course, the amount of data you'd want to track keeps growing faster as
So if we want to create or preserve privacy in this sort of world,
we need to change how we do transactions - keep less information,
do more immediate clearing instead of book-entry (at least that's getting cheaper as well), build systems that interact with people
that accept anonymity for most transactions, and use it by default.
On the other hand, there's money to be made in data-mining transaction data,
through improved marketing and targeted advertising - so we need
to find other ways for companies to make money on transactions
so they'll be willing to let go of the transaction data.

At 12:27 PM 4/26/97 -0500, Bruce Schneier wrote to NIST about their
proposals for an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) FIPS:
One of Bruce's comments is that any algorithm picked today will
probably be around until 2040-50; if computer speeds double every year,
then the marginally useful strength by then will be about 110-120 bits.
While it's nice to have an expandable key structure that will let you
increase the strength by then, 128 bits is really still strong enough,
and a fixed-keylength algorithm that's still workable in triple-mode should work just fine.
Allowing triple opens the field a lot, and by the time you need >128-bit keys,
machines will be so blazingly fast that a 50% difference won't matter much;
you'll still be able to encrypt that 1Gbps 3D video in real time.
How fast do you really need, in seconds, for typical smart-card apps?
64 cycles at 1MHz is 16000 bytes/second; 128 cycles is 8000 bytes/second.
How fast are most smartcards?  1MHz?  2MHz?  500kHz?
The main uses I can see for 8-bit crypto processing are
- cheap, large-volume crypto for uncompressed voice (needs 8000 bytes/sec)
- adding crypto to digital phones ( ~800-1660 bytes/sec )
- money cards (if you're not using public-key, maybe you need 100 bytes,
- ATM machines (which typically have 4800-bits/sec data connections,
Which interestingly knocks out Blowfish (18 cycles), Khufu (20), and RC5 (23),
and the only things faster are SEAL and RC4 stream-only cyphers.
It's a tradeoff between forcing the development and testing of
cutting-edge speed, which may cost you in strength, vs. supporting a
bunch of existing algorithms we're starting to understand.
If it takes an extra 2 years to develop new algorithms,
you've doubled computer speed, so you could use the 17-32-cycle algorithms
you're rejecting today.....
If this is the ulterior motive for requiring faster-than-current algorithms,
I'm all for it (:-)  Triple-DES is boring, slow, and just fine for most

A group of the Texan forces just invaded the home of one of their

The man was injured by glass, and has been treated.
They apparently haven't gotten along for quite a while,
and a number of the neighbors were starting to get
worried about the Republicans.  The house they attacked is
a heavy-duty adobe home.  The radio said the Republicans have
been communicating with the outside world, and that the normal
practice in this case was to cut the phone wires; didn't say if
the Republicans had the sense to bring a cell-phone or CB with them
when they attacked, but you'd hope an Internet-savvy group would :-)
To add some Cypherpunks content, this is one application for which
the pre-paid phone-card cellphones are a big win; if you've got
an account-based system, it's much easier for the Government to
ask the phone company what the suspects' phone number is
and order them to shut it down.  But card-systems would have to be traced from phone calls (very hard) or picked up with scanners.
Some other parts of the Republic have denounced this action.  Invading a government building would have been one thing, but attacking civilian non-combatants is distinctly against the rules of "civilized" warfare...

@_subject: Re: Fax Security Program 
There was a long discussion / flamewar about a product like this
a year or three ago; you can check the archives.
This system sounds a bit more interesting than the one
that someone was touting the last time, but essentially any system like this will have a subset of the following steps
0) Scan and digitize the original into a file, if it's not already online.
1) Compress the file (often combined with Step 0.)
2) Encrypt the file
3) Represent the file as a bunch of bits, possibly pixels (needs to add enough
4) Transmit the pixels using fax or modem or Internet protocols
5) Print onto paper and rescan (if receiver isn't a computer)
6) Recover the encrypted compressed file from the pixel representation
7) Decrypt the file, if encrypted
8) Decompress the file
9) Print onto paper, if desired.
Regular fax machines, and many scanners, combine steps 0 and 1;
regular fax skips steps 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
If the original is already a file, or is a more complex picture than G3 fax,
most products will use some proprietary representation, or maybe G4.
One snake-oil product used "Visual Encryption", which meant that they
represented the file as blocks of pixels, shuffled the pixels in some
not-blazingly-secure manner that had enough redundancy for error recovery,
and transmitted that.  Alternatives: 1) If you wanted to, you could do the pixel-representation before the encryption, and use strong encryption, but then you'd either need
to transmit directly to a computer instead of a fax machine or risk
major lossage from printing and rescanning, and you'd be encrypting far more
bits than you really need to, for no particular benefit -
unless your pixel-representation is a simple black/white pixel per bit
(i.e. you skipped the error correction or did it on the raw data.)
2) You could use a fax or modem to transmit the data as analog sound,
digitize and encrypt the sound, and transmit that over a modem or internet.
This has the advantage that you can use a regular fax machine and
it doesn't need to know you're playing with the audio, though if you
do it crudely you need to transmit a lot more bits,
unless you're using an ISDN connection which was already bits.
2a) You could "digitize" the sound by recognizing it as fax/modem tones and
demodulating into the original pixel-representation bits.
This can save you bandwidth (especially if you transmit your vanilla-9600-bps
fax signal over a 28.8kbps modem.)  Of course, if you were going to pay
to do that anyway, you probably should have just encrypted the data
on a PC and transmitted it by modem anyway instead of messing with Faxes.

It's a useful start, but treating corporations as one bloc makes it too easy for journalists and government to say things like
"Industry wants !"
Most corporations are primarily users - they want to protect their own
internal communications and recordkeeping enough for perceived threats,
but they aren't passionate about it - it's just a tool, not a product.
Some corporations, like PGP, selling privacy tools as products,
and most of them want to provide high security with no interference.
Other corporations have a market niche of sucking up to Government,
and trying to create a market for GAKked products - like TIS and Dorothy -
while using the Government to interfere with their competitors;
if a GAKked product increases a user company's security enough that
they're not losing much money on it, they've benefitted substantially,
and most user companies have to tell the government what it wants to know
when it wants to know it anyway, so GAK doesn't hurt them much.
Banks in particular fall into this user category - they really need to keep
from getting ripped off, since their losses are direct and immediate
(unlike, say, intellectual property leaking) - but most US banks
have no illusions that they're maintaining any privacy barriers between
their users and government.
Cellphone companies are a special case - their main privacy concerns
are keeping customers from complaining loudly, but the watered-down
digital encryption standards are enough to reduce eavesdropping,
and there's enough strong crypto to prevent billing fraud.
On the other hand, building an infrastructure that supports wiretapping
can be a big expense, and a big disruption to their network architecture
and operational efficiency, so now you're talking Real Money again.

I disagree.  Book-entry banks need some kind of fairly reliable
dispute resolution mechanism, but it doesn't need to be a force monopoly.
If you happen to have a nation-state just lying around to be used,
banks will be happy to use them, because they're more convenient for
wide-area business than Mafia enforcers, probably cheaper, and can be
more dependable and predictable, though your mileage may vary.
If you have relatively dependable identities, you can run a reputation
system without relying on governmental or private violence providers;
it's probably less expensive, but also less effective in most communities,
so the risk of losing money may make it less attractive than governments.
If people know that nobody will take their checks if they bounce them
and don't make good, and know they won't get any credit, and know that
the merchants are all on the Grapevine, they'll generally be honest*.
If identities are fluid, and you're willing to keep creating and burning them,
you can sometimes get away with reneging on obligations,
but people are less likely to trust you if they don't know you -
so they'll want to see certified e-checks from well-known banks.
I tend to view book-entry systems as an effect of an
economy that uses credit to fund business ventures;
you can call the book entries "bonds" or "stocks", but
book-entry is the obvious way to keep track of either one.
Sure, you could do things like split all revenues on receipt,
but book-entry is probably still easier.
[*Honest people will generally be honest anyway, which is most people
in most cultures, but that doesn't mean they'll be good enough at
planning to pay off their loans on time, especially if they're using

They're certainly nice boxes :-)  But are they really more cost-effective

Crypto mainly falls into three kinds of calculations
- bignum modular exp/mult/factor - Alphas are great at this
- bit-twiddling for DES and friends - don't know if Alphas like this or not,
- byte- and word-oriented cryto, like RC4 and IDEA - The _compiler_ needs to support 64-bit processing, but you're not likely to need 64-bit address spaces
or care too much how fast you can haul data from files into cache,
since you're mostly going to be bashing bignums in cache anyway.
If NT will let you run object code with 64-bit longs, you're ok.
Important topic, but Moore's Law will be with us for a couple more years,
so a factor of 10 in processing power is just 3-4 years speed increase.
That means you need about 3 bits more key for your symmetric cypher or
30 bits more for RSA or Diffie-Hellman public keys.  It's another nail in
RC4/40 and DES's coffins, and another motivation not to use 512-bit RSA,
but no problem for IDEA or RC4/128 or Triple-DES or 1024-bit RSA.
A more serious effect of big fast chips is that they can drive
better data collection machines - how much more pattern-searching and traffic analysis can altavista.nsa.mil and dejanews.nsa.mil do
with a multi-processor Alpha that they couldn't with their old DEC-20s?

You're a bit late - merlots have been getting more trendy :-)
But Chiles hasn't signed the Florida law quite yet, so you're also early.
Do they even _grow_ wine in Florida?  You'd think it would be the cocaine industry trying to get their product regulated to keep prices high.
It's especially ridiculous that shipping wine should be a *felony*.
Mike Froomkin points out that the Constitutional Amendment ending
Prohibition lets states make their own stupid decisions like this,
and it probably overrides Commerce Clause controls.
You'd expect that a law that's made primarily to protect business
interests would have business-oriented penalties - like fines for
conducting wine-shipping without a wine-shipping license,
or triple fines for not filling out paperwork in triplicate.
Does anyone know if either state's laws also penalize the recipient of the Demon Grape, or only the sender?  (And is there a list of the state legislators on-line? "Dear Senator Foobar:  If you'd passed S.B.336, you'd be busted now!")
About 10 years ago, New Jersey legalized home-made wine and beer,
with a requirement that you get a $3 permit.  Nobody'd particularly
realized it wasn't legal, and in a heavily Italian state people had
been making wine at home since Prohibition ended (...),
and everybody agreed it was stupid to keep it illegal.
But the burons wanted to retain _some_ control, hence the permit.
Enough people complained about it that they dropped the
permit requirement pretty quickly.

Sigh.  Calling something "*the* definition" of anarchy, when it's not
the definition anarchists use, doesn't cut it.  I realize that statists have convinced lots of people that "anarchy" means
"a bunch of bomb-throwing terrorists are going to run down the street
and kill your mama", but that's because they want to be in charge -
or at least have SOMEBODY be in charge, since they don't trust people
to act civilized without rulers who'll kill them if they don't behave. Whether you think anarchism *will* lead to bomb-throwing terrorists,
or in general whether it's a good or bad idea, is a separate argument.
But anarchists _ought_ to own the definition.  (Now, if you want to
split the anarchists by bringing up the propertarian vs. non-propertarian
issue and discuss whether "no property" is part of the definition
of anarchy or only a popular anarchist view, you'll end up with chaos (:-)
Around here you'll find mostly arachno-capitalists who think that
property is just fine, though not everyone agrees.
Over on soc.culture.anarchism, you'll find a lot more non-propertarians,
and an on-going squabble about Libertarianism.
One of your more interesting comments was on whether you can separate
the concepts of society and government - a fairly common view of government is that it needs to have a monopoly on the use of force to
preserve order, and therefore needs to have tax funding to exist,
and since you've got it around anyway you might as well use it for
things that are easiest to do in a centralized manner, and to do
things that require either social cooperation or lots of money;
a society like that will find government intertwined in its civil affairs,
and people will get out of the habit of organizing their own actions
without using government as a focus.  Other societies have used religious organizations to perform many of the same social functions -
if everybody's getting together weekly anyway, might as well talk about
the problems that have been going on, and raise the money needed to
feed the poor and patch the meetinghouse roof.  And other societies
have just done these things on a more individual basis, especially
in sparsely populated areas where there aren't outside invaders.
Of course, now that governments have taken over most of the world,
it's hard to find a place without outside invaders...
But people are still going to teach their kids what they need,
and people are still going to keep most of their agreements with
their neighbors, and they're still going to help each other resolve
arguments about the agreements that weren't kept, whether that
resolution is done by an armed posse, or by the offender's family
paying off the obligation in cattle, or by shunning people until they
do the right thing, or refusing to give credit to known deadbeats,
or whatever.  Government's only one choice.

Really interesting post!  I think the net will simplify the
ownership issues and the publicity issues long before it
makes good information about the value of small companies
easy to get.  That's far more dependent on the personalities
of the players in a company (hard to judge, except in person),
the ideas the company's trying to develop into products/services

usually very private, etc.)  On the other hand, the net can often help those parts of a business.
The Cygnus Support folks have done well in a very open environment.

Venture capital firms provide some value to their investors
by managing the granularity of the transactions, but they also
add value by providing personal understanding of the companies they're evaluating whether to invest in.  Information wants to be free,
or is at least cheap to copy, but providing the personal attention
needed to understand and analyze information and make good decisions on it
is still expensive.  The nets can improve the
information they have available on both the company and the market,
and can provide better information to investors about what venture capital analysts are good at evaluating what kinds of businesses.
Will the nets split these businesses up into individual
venture-advice-consultants competing for investors?  Or will the lead to broader coordination between venture capital businesses?  Or both?

It may be myth now, but we can work to change that!  (:-)
There may not be agents of Non-US Governments running remailers
that we know about yet, but there are intelligent Non-US individuals
running them, and Anarchists in North America, and Anarchists outside North America running remailers,
which if you're in the US Government is at least semi-threatening...
And the US Naval Research Labs folks are building Onion Routers,
which are relatively similar to remailers, and they're
Foreign Government Agents from the perspective of non-US cypherpunks.
A more common approach for government agents has been to post
news and send mail from various Internet addresses of convenience;
some of it has certainly been propaganda, and some has been
deliberate false information, as well as some being just
strongly-held beliefs of people I happen to disagree with.
If your remailer system is well-designed, running your mail through
the occasional KGB and CIA remailer is just fine, as long as you
also run it through systems you hope you can trust.  Even at that,
you may trust Alice B. Cypherpunk to run an honest remailer,
knowing that she's got a strong ethical policy against logging,
and not know that the NSA broke into her machine last year
and is been running a wiretap that's "perfectly US-legal" because
she's based in Amsterdam.
Are you aware of any cypherpunks remailers publicizing their log files,
at least beyond their published policies (e.g. the "You SPAM, You Die"
policy that some remailers announce.)  The main events of this type
I know of are Julf Helsingius and maybe one of the Dutch remailers
giving the name of anti-Scientologist to the police when ordered by a court, and Julf closed anon.penet.fi after that.
There have been some remailer operators who will help track down hate mail
in response to complaints, and some who will help track down high-volume spammers, and they generally make their policies known;
others only do blocking.
Back when I was running a remailer, what I saw from the bouncemail
and the complaints was a certain fraction of attack-mail,
which I dealt with by blocking recipients, a fair bit of spam
such as phone-sex ads to usenet (ignored), a lot of test messages
(sometimes ignored, sometimes diagnosed), and a lot of help requests
with incorrect headers (which I generally tried to reply to,
especially after I'd killed the remailer.)  The only times I checked non-bounced mail (other than testing my remailer code)
was to clean out high-volume spam (my remailer was set to shut down
at certain volume levels) and to remove queued mail for people who
complained, (and of course if the spammers had the sense
to encrypt their spam, that wouldn't have shown much either.)

it's Not Our Fault?"

users located outside US territory.  CompuServe is a prime example,
with users all over the world.  Some US-only-code-distribution sites
try to keep track of which sites are in the US, at least for .net.
Since the MIT code distribution site has been allowed to operate
in spite of this, the attitude of the Export Cops appears to be a
"Yes, we know it's bogus and unenforceable, but we need to at least
maintain the pretense that we're enforcing it, so don't ask
for too much technical clarification or we'll have to say No."

Mostly.  But you're presumably advocating government by humans.
And while government is an abstraction of the activities of a lot of individual humans, governments do tend to accumulate
and abuse power, and tend to reach a point where they're more
interested in maintaining and increasing that power than in
any legitimate activities like protecting life, liberty, and property.
Consider the drug war, the military-industrial complex,
the fraction of your income that's paying for government,
and compare that with 200 years ago...

An anonymous person quoted a Nando.net news story
There are some similarities between Mafia and CIA assassinations and the
kinds of AP that will become possible with widespread truely anonymous
communications and payment mechanisms, but also a lot of differences.
First of all, very few people think Mafia assassinations are a good idea :-)
On the other hand, in both cases, some good guys will get unfairly murdered,
as well as bad guys, innocent bystanders, and clueless henchpersons,
and in both cases there will be a chilling effect on the target population.
Both systems depend on anonymity and webs of trust.  With remailers, you're trusting the remailer operator not to rat on you, but you can chain several independent remailers together and be fairly secure.  With Mafia assassinations, Don Vito doesn't usually call a hit man directly - he expresses to one of his trusted lieutenants that Big Paul has been
a real irritant to him lately and that something substantial needs to be done about it.  And maybe the lieutenant arranges something himself, or maybe he talks to a guy who doesn't do "work", but has a friend who does.
You've got plausible deniability for the guys on top, and they've got really strong personal trust in the anonymity of their communications, because not only are there family relationships going back generations,
and a code of honor that says you don't rat on your friends,
but it's backed up by the fact that everybody you're dealing with knows your True Name and if you double-cross them your life won't
be worth the crabgrass growing on the unmarked graves where your
various body parts will end up when they're done with you :-)
One of the big differences is that the overhead required to maintain a
Mafia infrastructure is substantial - it's necessary for a high-class
full-time pre-information-age criminal organization to do something like that,
but it's also something that's mainly affordable only by mafias, governments,
and similar organizations that have lots of money and time to waste.
AP in a remailer environment needs perhaps less infrastructure,
and it's infrastructure that's worth developing anyway for other reasons -
but as a side effect it lets the ordinary person afford to have unpopular
people killed off just like the Big Players can.  It's still a government-like
activity, just more decentralized, and without the pretense of legitimacy.

@_subject: Libraries!  Partial Solution to PGP Windows Wars and Source Code 
[There's been a major flame war on pgp-users about the lack of Win3.1 support, and more than a few cypherpunks have asked about source.]
PGP has always had a policy of making the source code available;
it was one of the big things that let us trust it.
PGP has also been available under a variety of platforms,
whether written/ported by Phil and associates, or ported by others.
Recently, PGP Inc. has come out with several major systems, including
- PGP 3.0 and 3.0.1 pre-alpha code, including libraries,
- PGP 5.0 with fancy user interface for Win32 only.
I'm assuming that PGP 5.0 is written using the PGP 3.0.1 libraries* -
if they've got any sense, they've used the same libraries with at
most some bug fixes and/or simple new features that they can put out as a point release, and limited the Win32-related stuff to GUIs,
interfaces to other Windows programs, and similar non-portable stuff,
some of which can be bullied into working on DOS or Win16
and some of which is too much trouble to crowbar in.
If so, then *you* can do your own GUI work on Win16, MacOS 6, and OS/360,
and be sure of interoperability with Fancy New PGP.
In particular, the user-friendliness front-end programs like pgpclip and Private Idaho can use the libraries instead of having to pop up DOS subsystems to run.  (PI was very nice with ViaCrypt 2.7.1,

Using the libraries also helps us trust the security -
it doesn't mean the GUIware doesn't also send a copy of your passphrase
to aldrich but it does let you build interoperable code you
can trust, and it makes it easier to verify that at least the
basic crypto routines are solid.

Hi, Dave!   Thanks for forwarding the press release to various lists.
(Could you also forward this along to Mike Nelson?  The press release
didn't include his email :-)  I was interested in a couple of issues.
1) Cool - especially doing it without GAK!  This kind of thing is a major wedge in the export control regime, even if it is mainly for the
big players first.
2) Are there explicit terms a company has to agree to to be
allowed to export PGP to its non-US subs/branches, or is it
just negotiation with the State Department?  Does it take excessive
expensive legal paperwork, or is it something just about anybody could do?
Could Bill Stewart Consulting (i.e. just me) meet the requirements?
After a company is approved, are there special record-keeping requirements,
or could I just email or registered-US-Snail or DHL-mail a copy to my branch in Japan or the UK?  (One of the interesting cases for me is
subsidiaries that are joint ventures with other companies such as
non-government-owned foreign telcos.)
3) Your press release said:
Does this mean that the non-encryption parts of your code probably
won't be reviewed, at least in public?  BTW, the 5.0 plug-in to Eudora is nice!  I'm having a little trouble guessing
when it's going to include my signature block and when it's not,
but so far I like it, and the Win95 PGPtray widget was also convenient.

They're trading a discount on purchases for marketing information.
If you us an obvious pseudonym, they'll know that
Johnny Cash always buys Brand X pretzels with Brand Y beer,
but the SSN lets them check with TRW/Equifax/Etc. and find that
You, William J. Clinton, a married homeowner making $200K/year,
also have an American Express card and rent N hotel rooms/year,
and already subscribe to Soldier of Fortune and Rent-A-Politician,
but don't yet get the Nukes-R-Us or Victoria's Secret catalogs,
which is more valuable marketing information than just the groceries.
Some places might still be willing to give you a discount for the
pseudonym, but others combine their discount card with a check-cashing
card so they're probably not only not interested, but won't accept it
because [bounced-check-tracking credit bureau] doesn't consider
SSN unique and doesn't have a record for 999-65-4321.
I'd categorize you as well-meaning-but-needing-to-think-longer
rather than an evil "Uber-Enemy :-) Private companies asking for information are engaged in free speech -
you don't have to give them the answer they're hoping for,
and you don't have to do business with them if you don't want.
Radio Shack keeps asking for my phone number, I keep not giving it,
and the only thing that's changed about our business relationship
for many years is that they no longer sell real electronic components
and don't seem to have their free-battery club scam any more.
On the other hand, when the government _requires_ private companies to collect Nationalized TaxPayer ID Numbers to be allowed to deal with you,
it's a problem - for instance, requiring SSNs for bank accounts,
requiring SSNs for employers to verify with La Migra that you're a
Real Tax-payin' American instead of some Job-Stealin' foreigner,
requiring documentation on cash transactions over $750,
requiring car dealers to collect your SSN for car registration, etc.,
then there's clearly a privacy problem.  Sometimes you can avoid it,
by using non-US banks, contracting firms, etc., but it's a hassle.
One of the big effects of this is that the SSN _is_ a widely available
mostly-unique ID number that's useful for correlating information.
An alternative, if the government wanted to promote privacy,
would be to replace the Single SSN with a bunch of tax numbers
(either on a smartcard or just giving you a list on paper)
which would let you give everybody who needs a TaxId a different number.
They could still correlate all your tax information, but nobody else
would have the information to know that John Smith, bank-user,
is John Smith, home-owner, or John Smith, car-buyer.
Of course, this number would need to be more than 9 digits,
so it would break lots of old software, you wanted that stuff
broken anyway, and hey, the year 2000's coming as well :-)

A few weeks ago there was a thread about Florida's proposal
to ban direct shipments of wine into the state, making it a _felony_
for anybody except a state-licensed wholesaler to import alcohol.
The weekend I was up in the California wine country, and one of the
local papers had an article on other states limiting direct shipments.
Apparently about 24 states ban them, though only one makes it a felony;
the rest treat it as commercial business, either civil or criminal.
[That's evil also, but at least it's not an outrageous penalty...]
While mail-order wine has been a possibility for a while, the Internet has changed the marketing economics enough to be interesting,
and some of the Internet wine businesses have been fined by a few states,
with typical penalties of $7-35K.  At least one of them has taken a
Frissellian approach to the problem - $7000 isn't a big fine,
and it'll cost the government more than that to collect, so they're
ignoring it and trusting the economics and uncatchability
to encourage the government to ignore it also.

Web page picketing is easy - there are a bunch of ways to do it,
with varying degrees of coverage.  Here are some examples:
0) Hijack DNS or routers - sorry, no points for this.
1) Convince people to use your system for web access -
easy if you're AOL or Prodigy, trying to provide a family-oriented service,
or 's firewall; you can replace URLs at playboy.com
with the "You can't access that site from here" page.
2) Convince people to use your software - Censorware Inc
can do the same kind of thing, as well as tell their mom.
3) Create a serious picket sign FAQ web page and put it out there
for people to find.  And post your FAQ to Usenet occasionally.
4) Create a picket sign web page that's more attractive to AltaVista
as your target's page.  That won't stop references to but it will jump out at news reporters and casual browsers looking
for what yourtarget.com has on the web. You can do the usual comment lines
or small print at the bottom of the page
 lots of stuff about them and why they're Bad
5) Keep flaming them on Usenet, especially using lots of different
pseudonyms discussing it with each other, to fill up DejaNews.
Obviously you need good sub-flame picketing so people don't killfile you
like they did with S..... Ar..., the Turkish flamebot.
6) Getting a newsgroup created just for criticizing them gets extra points.
7) Set up a Boycott Information Center web page or a Badder Business Bureau
and make it easy for people to post the Bad Things done by lots of Bad People.
In addition to your targets, you could prime it with other popular Bad People,
or just advertise it well, and make it easy to use, serious-looking,
and attractive to people of the political/economic persuasion you want
8) Set up a Web Page Parodies Home Page, and make it easy for people to post
parodies of other web pages; add a zinging parody of your target.
Usenet being a moving parody of itself, it's a good place to create a that you can also use to parody the target.
9) Usenet signature lines are cheap and easy - use them, and point to
your picket web pages from them.  If you can get people to copy yours, even better.  You can think of more.....

Unfortunately, this is not entirely true.  Within US-occupied North America (:-), a number of the NAPs are still government funded, though many of the big carriers also have direct interconnections rather than only peering through the NAPs.   One of the early NAPs, the Commercial Internet eXchange (CIX), was created specifically
to avoid the content censorship required for use of the government parts
(the old Acceptable Use Policy, which banned commercial discussion.)
In other countries, your kilometerage will vary substantially.
Also, the DNS top-levels are largely managed by governments or their
subcontractors - not just the root servers and NSI's .com/.org/etc,
but also .fr, .de, .ru, etc.  Some of this may change with the IAHC plan,

You're not doing very well.  I can see a number of possible meanings:
1) You want to be able to "picket" other people's net traffic,
and think that the amount of government funding out there gives you some standing to force some parts of the net to carry your "picket signs".
And therefore you keep posting similar vigorous assertions, in response
to other people's contentions that this would be bad.
2) You do/don't/don't-care think it's a good idea, but you're
trying to make the point that it _is_ theoretically something the
government could require, and are trying to get people to accept
this concept while they're arguing either that it would be bad,
or that it's not something they could require.
2b) As above, but you're further contending that, to be consistent,
the government _must_ apply their standards for picketing, union elections, etc., to the Internet (again, regardless of whether you
think this is good, bad, or ugly.)
3) You think that it would be OK for a service provider to do this
(whether or not you think it's a good idea) and are contending that
it's ok, while you think other people are arguing that it's not ok.
4) You want to accomplish something _like_ picketing, and think that
intercepting the picketee's traffic is required, as opposed to other
picketing-like methods available, and are trying to get agreement?
Is one of these your point?  Or is it something else, and I just don't
get what you're point is?  To me, it looks like you're just asserting

Vulis has contributed a few good things to the remailer discussions,

Bell's value, by contrast, has been in the Assassination Politics work.
Sure, he's a mostly one-track ranter, to the extent that lots of people got fed up with it, but much of his analysis is sound even though
his advocacy of it is pretty dodgy.  I don't think that anybody is
likely to set up this sort of Assassination Pool on a regular basis,
but he does solve one of the fundamental difficulties with it -
how to let the real hit man claim that he did the job and where to
send his payment when the deal is handled entirely over the net
(and thus there's no good way to prove who done it vs. who's claiming
they did it to get the money.)  Some of these techniques may be useful
when applied to other problems in the emerging Internet economy;
it gets at issues of repudiation of anonymous transactions,
need for (real) escrow, etc.
Bell's point that government would be much better behaved if the individuals
in government could be held individually and personally responsible
for their actions is certainly valid.  Whether shooting them is an appropriate way to hold them responsible is another discussion (:-).

@_subject: Re: Who "invented" remailers? 
There's prosecution and there's investigation (and there's harassment.)
If the number of people using the remailers and PGP is small,
then it's easier to compile and expand the list of "usual suspects"
who can be checked out more carefully with other means.
For a real-world case, a friend of mine who lives in a Third World kleptocracy
has a copy of PGP, but doesn't want to risk using it except for
very critical mail, because his email and phones are routinely tapped
(it's the kind of place that when he got a new higher-speed modem the
phone company called him up and asked him what he was doing....)
The local thugs were considering stealing the computer that forwards his
but were deterred by the argument that it's password-protected so they won't be able to use it if they steal it.  PGP would really stand out,
and could lead to them stealing it anyway - if they were the politically
murderous type rather than just thieves and thugs, it would be a serious risk.
("This is a job for Steganography, man!")
Suppose, for instance, that the Feds (whatever COINTELPRO calls themselves
these days) are watching Alice the Activist, and find that she's using
Bob's Remailer.  So they watch Bob's Remailer, and find it's sending traffic to Carol  Maybe they haven't known about her before.
Or maybe they check with foobar.com and find she's probably Carol the Commie,
who they hadn't previously known used email.  No, they can't prove that
Alice sent mail to Carol - but she's still a lead, and since they're
both politically incorrect people, it's not a bad guess.
Even with multiple remailers, say 10, this still works.
On the other hand, if there are a lot of remailer users, from diverse
communities, with lots of recipients and lots of traffic sources,
this attack is less of a problem -- but it's still a problem.
For instance, if Spam Inc. is sending out 50,000 Spams/hour, and the Feds see Carol's name in the remailer's sendmail log,
there's no reason to bother checking up on her further.
However, if they're also snooping the outgoing mail,
and the mail to her was PGP-encrypted, and the 50,000 SPAMs weren't,
then the mail to her is still interesting, even though they can't read it.
You could hack the remailer to insist that all outgoing mail be
encrypted (or at least contain "BEGIN PGP ENCRYPTED MESSAGE"),
which would also cut down on Spamming, but it takes you back to the
case of too few users.
The ghio2 remailer code I used to write my (former) remailer had a "remailer-stats" command, that would give you traffic levels.
I don't know how many of the other remailers support it.

Phill, I'm really appalled at this posting of yours.
When a bunch of armed marked people storm your house with assault rifles
and grenades, without warning you to come out first,
and you shoot back at them, that's not murder.  That's self-defense.
It may be stupid - there's a lot to be said for lying on the floor
with your hands over your head, which will make the armed assault force
feel slightly guilty if they shoot you in the back - but it's
not murder, and it's not anything resembling murder.
If the BATF killed any of the Davidians in the incident, _that_ would have been murder.  Even if the Davidians knew, and they apparently did,
that an armed gang was about to storm their house without warning,
that's still self-defense, not murder.  Waving a white flag out the window
before the attackers have a chance to sneak up and storm you
would probably embarass or confuse them, but the Davidians had no
reason to trust that the assault force would respect it
and not just shoot them anyway -- and besides, while the Davidians
had fewer guns per person than the average Texan, they were
paranoid wackos, and surrendering before being attacked isn't the
kind of thing you expect paranoid wackos to think of at dawn
after being warned by a phone call.
I didn't say the people who disagreed with you on this list
weren't engaging in macho flash rhetoric here :-)
Not just the SAS - even the FBI said after the first wave of attacks that,
unlike the BATF, they really try not to lead armed assaults
when there are women and children in the way.  By a couple of months
later, the political pressure had become strong enough that they
decided to do it anyway, but at least at first they were embarassed
about the situation their colleagues had gotten them into.
The US military has better-trained people also, but there's a very strong
tradition against using the US military for domestic incidents -
our so-called Civil War has really soured us on that.
But whether you're looking at the SAS, Marines, BATF, Delta Force,
or FBI Hostage Rescue Team, the mission wasn't something a military assault force is right for - that sort of thing is fine for rescuing hostages from terrorists, or killing terrorists before
they set off bombs or shoot the neighbors.  But the legal objective
of the police should have been to inform the Davidians that the
police want to search their house, or that they were wanted in court, or maybe even to arrest them if there was enough evidence to convince a judge to sign an arrest warrant.  What can a military do?  Shoot the adults for refusing to surrender, while trying not to shoot the kids too?  Militias can do things like keep the Davidians from running away when the police knock on their door, but there probably wasn't enough evidence of a crime to justify an arrest, certainly not of anyone but
Koresh, and if everybody _did_ run away, that would make searching their
house to get evidence of contraband possession easier.
Again, the Davidian's response was stupid, but this wasn't a "visit from the police", this was an assault force that shot first
while they were storming the house at dawn.
The local sheriff had visited the house the previous year
to respond to allegations of potential child abuse.
Came up, knocked on the door, they let him in, everybody talked,
he decided there was no evidence of criminal child abuse,
just weird religious and personality-cult.  No problem.
If he'd wanted to do the same again, he could have,
and he could have done something similar for the weapons charge.
If they _had_ checked, they'd have found that one of the
residents was a licensed firearm dealer, and could have checked his records, which he's legally required to keep and present.
No need to storm somebody's house just because you're worried that
they might flush a couple of pieces of metal down the toilet
when they see you coming - it's not like it's DOPE or something.
Also, if he'd wanted to arrest Koresh, he could have done it in town,
or when the guy was out jogging, which was daily.
The militias??  Phill, the only militia that McVeigh was part of was
the US Army.  Sure, they're one of the world's leading terrorist organizations, and they probably should have noticed that he was a wacko and kicked him out, like the Michigan Militia had the sense to do, rather than training him to be a gung-ho killer, but sometimes you
don't realize what somebody's like or what Army training will do to them.
And besides, I've had friends who were Army recruiters, and when you've
got a quota to make, you'll take anybody who can write "X" and
knows how to make a fist.
As far as blame for Waco goes, Janet Reno has said it's all hers.
[NOW FOR A FLAME] Janet Reno, who started the wave of minority church burnings in the South,
just had the GALL to make a speech talking about all the good things she's been doing to stop that sort of thing.  Not about how she's
personally responsible and has been trying to rehabilitate herself,
but about how other people are evil and need to be stopped.

For security, you need encryption.  There's really no question about it,

For convenience, you'd rather not need user-visible encryption,
but SSL lets you do an encrypted web interface without the user
needing to do any work.  The catch is that it becomes much harder
to do chained encryption - if the cgi remailer program does it,
the connections from the web remailer through the chain are secure,
but the user still needs to trust the web-remailer.
You may not _want_ too much convenience, to discourage spammers,

Having argued that point vociferously in the past, I'm now going to
waffle on the issue - while the business need is for access to
stored data, this may often include stored messages received from
a communication system in encrypted form.  Either the User Interface
needs to make it convenient to store the decrypted message,
or else the user will store the message in encrypted form -
which means there may be a business need for Proper Authority Access later.
This means, as {cypher,coder,ranter}punks, we need to address
this problem when building crypto tools, to avoid building systems
that create or sustain a business need for access to communication keys.
Some email systems really encourage you to save messages in one big hulking undocumented monolithic email box, with subfolders and databases and attachments and pointers, and some are a bit more
friendly but still leave bits and pieces of MIME splattered on your disk.
Some of the nicer tools I've used for encrypted file/mail handling
make it convenient to take encrypted incoming mail, decrypt it,
and either view it or save it to a file or clipboard.
I've been using PGP Inc.'s PGP5.0 Eudora Plug-In,
and it decrypts the mail into the mail message buffer itself.
When you finish with that particular message (e.g. go to the next,
or just close it), you get asked it you want to save the modified message,
and if you say "yes" you'll have the decrypted message in your mailbox.
However, there's a negative about this - if you receive mail that's signed and encrypted, and save the modified version, it loses the
signature information - so it may be more valuable to save the
encrypted version...

@_subject: Who is an encrypted message for? [PGPtray/Eudora] 
PGP 5.0 GUI on Win95 does this for both PGPtray and the Eudora plug-in.
When you want to decrypt a message, it doesn't tell you who the message
is TO when asking you for the passphrase.  Therefore, if you have
more than one user id with different passphrases, you don't know
which one to type in.  Also, from a security perspective, this is bad, because what you do with the contents of a message may be different
depending on who it came to or from - was that mail asking for the
Secret Plans addressed to your individual Work key, your department key,
your home key, or your Illuminati Conspiracy key?
This appears to be Versionb b14c3, though it's not easy to find out,
and I'm not sure if that's the version of PGPtray, PGPkeys, or both...

@_subject: Re: PGP Key generation 
for unspecified If you're concerned about legitimacy, independence of keys, etc.,
then doing them one at a time is the way to go.  However, if you're
just trying to gen up a bunch of keys to fake your way through an
authentication system that wants "different" keys, and you don't mind
a bit of coding or code-borrowing, you can do far better.
First of all, you can generate 10,000 different RSA keys by generating
~142 prime numbers and using combinations of two of them.
Furthermore, you don't need to generate good random numbers to seed
the prime number searcher, so you've gone from 10,000 randoms plus
10,000/P(prime) prime searches to 1 random plus 142/P(prime) prime searches.
However, your RSA keys may not even need to be that good,
depending on the authentication system you're trying to weasel into.
RSA uses n=pq, p and q prime, and ed==1 mod (p-1)(q-1),
where e and d are relatively prime to n (usually e is a small prime.)
So you could pick _one_ pair of primes and 10,000 values of e,
if the test doesn't mind that all the (e,n) pairs have the same n,
and the e's can be a table of the first 10,000 primes.
A cheap test might or might not notice, depending on whether it's
using PGP KeyID or fingerprint or some other hash.
(Since the keyID is "just the bottom few bits of the modulus",
a test using the KeyID would notice -- so you've got to social-engineer
them into using a "better" test with the length and fingerprint :-)

An interesting perspective, but I don't know that it works.
For this to make sense, either the business needs to have access to
the stored received email if the user gets run over by a police car,
or else the business needs to know that it doesn't _need_ access -
either because the mail isn't business related, or because the
business-related parts have been transferred to other systems
using a convenient user interface.
On the other hand, if receiving email with encrypted attachments
is _in_convenient to store in a mail system, maybe it will help
encourage people not to use that mail system for storing messages,
or to junk the mail system entirely :-)  (I'm thinking here of systems
like IBM PROFS and Microsoft Mail, which both encourage storage
in their monolithic mailboxes.
Yeah!  (Actually, the other reason to escrow them is because
you're using the same keys for communication and storage,
and you have potentially decent business reasons for backup
of storage keys, but that's only the case if you're not using
a sufficiently flexible cryptosystem and are using key backup
instead of data backup, which is really the preferred approach anyway.)

@_subject: Re: [Noise, California only] Good deal on ISDN access 
Connecting at 28.8 is a totally different game - it's using
pure analog modems taking advantage of the relatively low noise
of most phone lines, which tend to be either short distances or
carried over T1 local loops.  It's close to the theoretical limit
of what you can get, assuming Gaussian noise distributions,
and of course 33.6 is a lot closer  :-)
The 56kbps cheats, taking advantage of the fact that the
noise on a digital line isn't Gaussian, and is mostly predictable.
It only works from the digital end (an ISP's T1) to the analog end,
and not the other way around, but for most people, that's fine -
anybody who's moving a lot more than 28.8kbps outbound probably
wants more than 56kbps anyway, and meanwhile it's a potentially big win
for the average data consumer.
Actually, it's a lot pickier; the line needs to be able to carry
192kbps of digital signal to haul the 2*64+16+overhead kbps of bits.
And if you're too far away, you lose, unless the phone company
throws in a lot of expensive repeater equipment.  On analog, if you're
too far away, your signal just degrades and you get lower bit rates.
But ISDN does work for a lot of people.
Cost and price are totally different questions; your phone company
may vary along with your mileage.  Some places think it's a high-value business service and charge big bucks for it;
other phone companies think you're getting 2.25 phone lines
and charge you for 2.  Some, like PacBell, charged a reasonable
monthly rate, assumed most of the use was business and wanted
to stimulate market growth, so they made it free at night,
not realizing what "free at night" means to computer users :-)
We'll see how long their cheap tariff lasts.

@_subject: Re: Untraceable Contract Killings 
That's not the novel part - in addition to anonymous contract killings,
it's also easy to run an anonymous fund that _claims_ it will use any
donations of digicash encrypted to the fund's public key for assassinating
the designated target.  In both that approach, and Bell's, there's still
the reputation problem of making sure the person collecting the money
really does pay off the killer.  What's novel about Bell's version
(and I don't know whether it originate with him or not) is that
it provides a cyberspace-only mechanism for the assassin to demonstrate to the payer that he's the one who did the job
and isn't some wannabe claiming to have done it to collect the cash.
There are alternatives, like posting a photo of the corpse to
a time-stamping service and then to Usenet, though this adds
some risk to the assassination, and is less useful for
public killings (e.g. if the President gets shot,
and there's a well-known address for the assassination pool,
the White House Press Corps may try to get their photographs
into the pool before sending them to Reuters and, umm, AP.)
The assassin still has to make sure he gets paid, and Bell suggests
(incorrectly, I think) that since all the payer is doing is
running a lottery, not contracting for killings, that the payer
could be a persistent entity with some reputation capital
who has an incentive to pay off.  I think Bell is imagining that a lot of people would be willing to
pay $5 for killing high-profile targets, like a few IRS agents,
so this wouldn't be a problem for the targets _he_ wants killed off.
Getting people to chip in large amounts of money is tougher.

They're radically different cases.   TRW gets your information from
people who get credit reports on you, and from creditors who lend you money,
both of which are voluntary transactions on your part.  You have the option,
when negotiating the terms of your business with a company,
to specify in your contracts what information they may pass on to third
parties, and what restrictions they need to put on that information.
Yes, almost everybody you deal with gives everything to TRW or one
of its competitors, but you can negotiate that yourself.
The reason they do is that it reduces their risks substantially
when dealing with the Information Mongers, and therefore reduces
their costs and makes them more likely to give you credit,
and lets them charge you less money for the credit they give you.
But if you can't come to an agreement with anyone, you won't be
able to borrow money from them, and you'll need to pay cash up front
for things, but those were all voluntary transactions as well.
On the other hand, the DMV isn't voluntary - sure they tell you
"well, you don't _have_ to drive or own a car", but unlike creditors, who won't do anything bad to you if you don't
borrow money from them, the DMV forces you to deal with them
by threatening to have cops haul you off to jail and
steal your car if you drive without dealing with them.  It's an offer you can't refuse.  Therefore, there are two
ways I can see to look at their use of data:
1) You're slaves anyway - go cope :-)
2) You've given them far more information than
you wanted to, and they should respect your privacy
and not give it to anyone.

defeat Stacker/Doublespace and prevent you from repairing the file
if it's corrupted* but not strong enough to keep the NSA out.
MSMail encourages you to send MSWord attachments and Powerpoint graphics

If someone steals my Eudora mailboxes, they'll need to snarf a few MB
of accumulated mail (though much of the good stuff will be saved
in files), but even if they only get part of the file, it's readable.
Someone who steals my MSMAIL.MMF will get 100+MB of noise,
hiding a relatively small amount of signal, and if they only get
part of it before losing the connection, it'll probably be corrupt.
[*Actually, my MSMAIL.MMF _is_ corrupted - MSMail has a self-repair /
garbage collector feature enabled by hitting magic keys at startup,
which on my mailbox is a bit overenthusiastic -- it deletes all the
attachments, leaving only the headers/text of messages and the
icons for the now-missing attachments.  So I can't use it...]

And make sure your proxy server only accepts encrypted requests,
so that eavesdropping doesn't gain much.
The hard problem is getting enough people to run the things.
While the _right_ solution is probably to put anonymous web proxies
in the distribution versions of Apache or Stronghold, so that there
are thousands of them, the alternative is convincing people to run them.
Unlike email remailers, where the big annoyance is dealing with spam,
the main problem with running web proxies is just volume.
Adding a semaphore or rate limiter to the proxy might help,
and I've heard some people have blocked large GIFs - but you
still want to handle downloads of contraband software,
which means accepting and caching multi-megabyte code.
I suppose it would be interesting for anonymous web proxies
to generate cover traffic as well - periodically browse sites like
Radikal mirrors and other contraband.

Bell's AP isn't a Democratic Assassins Program - it's a free-market system.
In a free market, when enough people want something enough to pay for it, like buying dope or killing someone, someone may decide it's worth their while
and just do it.  The catch is that he confuses mechanism with policy;
the market doesn't really care _why_ someone has a price on their head.
In a Democratic Assassins Program, everybody gets together and
haggles about who ought to be killed and why, and if a majority
wants someone killed, they go do it, or hire someone to do it for them,
and tell the minority what a wonderful thing Democracy is.
The US theoretically has a Republican Form Of Assassination -
everybody votes on some representatives, and the representatives
do whatever they can get away with, given future elections as a moderating
such as assassinating hundreds of thousands of Iraqis instead of the
one Iraqi they told us we should all Hate for Two Minutes,
or sending poisoned cigars to annoying bearded guys.
In practice, we have a Capitalist Mixed-Economy Assassination Process -
the Representatives decide to assassinate some people because it
seems to be popular in the polls, and other people because the Big Business interests want them assassinated, or because the Pentagon wants to advertise their availability for future jobs, and
some free-market "work" gets done, since you don't _have_ to annoy the national-scale interests to get assassinated,
some things get done by Good Old Fashioned Volunteerism*,
government-hired assassins decide ignore some collateral damage
or work overtime in the war on Republicanly-Selected Substances
and some people are society offenders who might best be underground
or just tempt Darwin too many times.

Get the beta at  and try it out.  I've been very pleased
with it - the integration into Eudora is very nice, and the
PGPtray icon works much better than the Enclyptor did - you can
encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify to and from the clipboard,
making it easy to work with non-PGP-aware applications.
The key management has been mostly separated from the encryption,
which was really the right thing to do anyway,
and if you like GUIs, it's got one.  If you're trying to write programs to integrate PGP
without using the GUI, you'll have to do some work again;
enough of the details have changed.
PGP 5.0 uses two types of keys - the familiar RSA keys, which are handled
compatibly with previous versions of PGP, and new-algorithm keys,
which use DSA for signatures, Diffie-Hellman for encryption, and SHA-1 hashes.
It can use the old keys, and generate RSA keys you can use with older PGP,
but obviously the older PGP can't use the DSA/DH keys.  I don't remember
if the freeware version that you can get at MIT will also generate new RSA keys or only use them.
The keyring files themselves are obviously different, since they can contain DSA/DH keys and some other data, but they're upward compatible.

I mostly agree with Arturo, especially about giving credit and

Publicity about how the Feds are trying to push
weak crypto on us is worthwhile - the timing was especially pleasant
given Kerrey's new anti-crypto bills in Congress.
Sameer's post did two things - hyped his own company (hmmm :-)
and provided an opportunity for good inflammatory rhetoric.
On the other hand, DES really is _much_ weaker than the DESCHALL
project indicates - Intel CPUs aren't at all tuned for DES cracking,
whereas a custom DES-cracker with similar horsepower could have
done the job a lot faster.  If I remember right, Wiener's design
used 64,000 chips, about as many as there were PCs working DESCHALL,
for a crack that would take hours instead of months.

Americans would never stand for that sort of abuse!  (As you said, "The whole system is corrupt".)  There have been exceptions - the Alvarado-Sanchez case, in which the
Supremes decided that police had not had sufficient reason to stop
a truck traveling near but parallel to the US/Mexican border,
and therefore no right to start poking flashlights in the windows,
and no right to order the driver to open the tarp covering
half a ton of marihuana.  Or for that matter the Miranda case,

No.  It means that a couple of Senators don't like free speech and privacy,
and there have been Senators who disliked those before.
If the whole Senate passes the bill, and the House, and the President
signs it, then there'd be a law we'd have to fight in court,
depending on what it said by the time it was done.
But that's a long way off (probably.)  Of course, if the bill does
get through the House and Senate, Clinton's sure to sign it;
he's _not_ a liberal, just a big-spending Democrat, and seems to
consistently support anti-privacy decisions, and if there's enough
wind blowing in the direction to get the Congress to agree on it,
he'll be following it.
Meanwhile, the US Gov't can already start blaming crypto users for being
Commie-supporting money-laundering assassin-funding child pornographers,
if it thinks it's got a case.  Don't need any new laws for that,

force someone to reveal their passwords, and they risk being harassed about
false arrest and such if they maliciously accuse someone.

to build tools that will protect and advance these things.

@_subject: Re: Extremely Disappointing: Political Cryptography 
We're far better off without one, for a bunch of reasons.
1) Congress does stupid knee-jerk things without understanding them,
but it only does them when there's a lot of public pressure,
or focused insider pressure, or when its legs itch,
but after it's done it goes off and does stupid knee-jerk things
about some other "problem" that it wants to "help".
Attention Deficit Disorder is your friend, at least when Congress has it.
The only time it does things on a long-term basis are when it really cares;
things like funding the military-industrial-welfare complex
and local pork.  The Internet probably isn't there yet,
even though it's almost as much fun as Dope or Commies to rant about.
2) Bureaucracies, on the other hand, have self-perpetuation as Job 1.
Sure, they may understand their subject matter a bit better, but
Job 1 means continuing to do "useful" things to "help" the country,
most of which are almost by definition bad, and finding ways to
increase their scope of control.  Unlike Congress, whose agenda
depends on which way the wind is blowing, their agenda is fixed.
What they do will not only be bad, but it will be done competently,
which is harder to throw out in court than knee-jerk stupid things.
Furthermore, it will be done quietly, broadly, and not distracted
by the crisis of the week.
The FCC was terminally incestuous and corrupt from the beginning.
Its job, done quite well, was to restrict access to the airwaves,
just as the job of the other Roosevelt-era agricultural and
industrial programs was to create and preserve oligarchies in the names of "anti-trust" and "consumer protection".
FCC spectrum allocation policies, granting monopoly control of the
"commercial" parts of the spectrum and banning "commercial" speech on the "amateur" bands, have not only prevented a free market in
broadcasting, they've severely limited the span of opinions that
they consider to be "in the public interest" and therefore permitted
on the airwaves.
We did actually get a few good years out of them - the DoD was
running it, and since their objective was to get _their_ job done,
they built a lot of good technology that was different than what the
phone monopolies and IBMs were building.  Yes, there was a political agenda:
you could only use the net for "non-commercial", government-contract-related,
or university purposes, but they fundamentally didn't care as long as you
weren't blatant about it, so the culture could develop in a more balanced
manner, and people could build interesting fun things essentially
Those days are over, of course, and throwing out the government control
is far from a finished job, especially outside the US, but the free sector
is much larger than the bureaucratic sector, so they can't do much harm.

@_subject: Re: Party on IRC 
You'd have to think about what you wanted it to do,
but it should be quite doable.  IRC is normally for sharing
conversations between an amorphous, changing bunch of people,
which isn't really a standard thing to do with crypto.  But I can see several basic models:
0) Just Speak Finnish :-)
1) Two-person, with Diffie-Hellman key exchange
2) N-person shared-key - you'd probably use RSA to give the session key
to each new participant, or use PGP to do it.
3) N person, one key per sender, shared as above.
4) Ignore the application layer, and build the crypto as an IPsec tunnel.
5) Ignore the IRC protocols, and build a similar conversation server
using web forms and SSL.
Some tools you'd want`for 1-3:
a) Convenient cut&paste between the IRC makes integrating things easier,
such as key exchange, e.g. drop in a PGP message with today's key.
b) The ability to mix encrypted and unencrypted messages, so it's easier to do things like join the channel and negotiate keys.
c) A crypto operating mode that doesn't depend on sequence -
probably a line basis is about right.  ECB mode is boring and unsafe,
but you could use a session key (distributed with RSA/DH/etc.) to encrypt a per-line nonce key, and encrypt the line with the nonce,
transmitting "encryptednonce, encryptedline" for each line of data.
Perhaps this is less secure (?), but can you do something like
linekey = Hash( Hash(sessionkey, nonce), sessionkey ) transmitting "nonce, encryptedline"?  This would let you use a hash
instead of a symmetric crypto for the key on each line,
and might make it more convenient to choose a stream cypher such as RC4/160 instead of a slower block cypher such as IDEA or DES for the line encryption.

and (not that they cared personally) more useful for databases.
He gave them the thumbprint.  This was before the states were allowed
to make it mandatory to provide SSNs; CA wants both now, of course.)
Also, there's an obvious extension to gun registration,
which is the requirement to provide several bullets shot
with each of your guns, so they can do ballistics checks later.
Obviously it won't stop unregistered gun trading,

major terrorist organization has access to all the crypto they need:
unlike fully assembled missiles and plutonium, which are hard to get and

will make it forgery more common and digital signatures less trusted.

A few years back, the Libertarian Party was trying to get
on the ballot in Washington State by running a governor campaign.
They didn't make it, because they lost the protest votes to
a candidate who changed his name to "Absolutely Nobody".
Absolutely Nobody got about 7% of the vote.
(The unfortunate followup story later ran in the SF Chron under the title "Absolutely Nobody died today"; he was in
politics because he was an AIDS activist, and had the disease.)
During the '92 elections, I was considering getting Frank Zappa on the ballot in New Jersey.  He'd already dropped
out of the race due to his cancer, but it only takes 1000 signatures there,
which would have been an afternoon's work at Rutgers.
He's dead now, but he probably would enjoy running anyway :-)

               *** RALLY AGAINST INTERNET CENSORSHIP ***
     ** Supreme Court Decision on CDA Expected Wednesday or Thursday **
AMENDMENT I: "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
               *** RALLY AGAINST INTERNET CENSORSHIP ***
          ** South Park, San Francisco, California -- 1 PM **
In February 1996, President Clinton made Internet censorship the law of the
land by signing the Communications Decency Act.  The CDA -- a blatant
affront to free speech -- has since become a symbol of the ignorance and
contempt the American political establishment reserves for Internet users
and their constitutional rights.
Now, more than one year later, the United States Supreme Court is poised to
decide the fate of free speech for the 21st century.
On Wednesday or Thursday of this week, the Supreme Court will issue a
decision in the landmark case of ACLU vs. Reno.
On the day the decision comes down, The Electronic Frontier Foundation,
Wired Ventures, and the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition invite you
to join us for a RALLY to show your support for free speech online.
PLEASE JOIN US to discuss the free speech implications of this ruling with
plaintiffs and organizers of the legal challenge.
WHEN: On the day the Supreme Court issues its decision.
EITHER.... Wednesday June 25, 1997 *OR* Thursday June 26, 1997 at 1 PM
For up-to-the-minute information on the status of the decision, please

Heh - it's already that way in some places if you try to

After the results of the 1990 Census were in, New Jersey was re-gerrymandering
their Congressional District boundaries.  Aside from the usual goals
(making sure the Republicans, who were then in power, had solid districts),
there were the usual concerns about racial balance, so they wanted to
create a district in the east-central side of the state that was mostly minority (largely Hispanic, in this case).  The first cut didn't have
enough minorities, so they moved the boundary to include Rahway Prison.
The legal system being what it is, the residents are largely minority .....
and most of them can't vote :-)

No surprise - a book on bombmaking has so little to do with anarchism*

[*Ok, there have been a few anarchists who've thrown bombs,

much attention to the government's opinion on whether bombs ar cool,

No point in being anonymous when I'm flaming you.  Bruce did _not_ appear to be saying "I'd be shocked, _shocked_ if this were posted to the net."
He said he's talked his publishers into putting some great crypto books
on CD-ROM, which is the sort of the publishers do to make money.
Even if you're not impressed with copyright laws as law, or with the
enforcability of copyright laws, you can still not rip them off.
Adam Back, by contrast, said he'd be quite pleased if some US cypherpunk
were to physically mail him a copy of the disk, which he'd pay for.
While that's arguably violating export laws, it's not ripping anyone off.
You could argue, BTW, that CD-ROMs _are_ print - after all, they're
just dark and light dots on plastic intended to be read optically,
and they're not much different from a really small print Braille font.
You might need to argue that with Judge Patel, _after_ the DoiJ/NSA/BXA
appeal the Bernstein settlement and lose :-)  And it's probably worth
getting the bar-code version of the T-Shirt through export first.

How do you do that?  Arrange the XORs to do x0^x1, x2^x3....,
then (x0^x1)^(x2^x3)... etc., ending up with user 0 doing the last XOR,
and broadcasting or tree-casting the results?  It cuts down on bandwidth
for the average user, but does end up with a few users doing most of the work,
and perhaps there's some security risk in the unbalanced workload.
It's an interesting approach, and I suppose you could do a bit more work
(logn instead of 2) to spread the partial results around so more people
can calculate them directly (e.g. user 0 sends user 2 x0^x1, and sends user 1 x2^x3, and if you're still paranoid you can have user 0 also send
user 3 x0^x1, which user 2 and user 3 can compare....)
You've probably got to put more thought into getting the details right,
like collision detection and backoff, but it's still doable.

@_subject: PGP 5.0 doesn't tell me Which key a message is signed by! [SEVERITY 1] 
Yow!  I'm using PGP 5.0, with the PGPtray and the Eudora Plugin,
in a version that appears to be b14c3 for Win95.
When I receive a signed email message, or check with PGPtray,
it tells me the message is from "User ",
but doesn't tell me it's from KeyID 0x12345678 or the fingerprint of the key or anything even vaguely difficult to fake.
Thus, I've signed this message as Phil Zimmermann FAKE ,
and if I'd left out the FAKE it would be difficult to tell it
from a real Phil key.  The GUI happily gives me a message box saying
"Good signature from Phil Zimmermann FAKE ".
We've been discussing 0xDEADBEEF attacks on Cypherpunks and Coderpunks,
but this appears to be far worse - I hope it's been fixed
for the production version?

@_subject: Re: Degaussing 
Thanks for posting a marvelous reference on erasing media.
Technology changes have a substantial effect on what's
adequate and what's not.  Back in the mid-late 80s, when I was a tool of the military-industrial complex, we had the offical rules for declassifying media;
I think they were from Army Reg 380-380.
For disk drives and magtapes, you had the choice of
physical destruction, running an NSA-approved overwrite program,
or using an NSA-approved BF magnet for degaussing.
We didn't have an approved program for Vax UNIX,
not that I would have trusted it to clean mapped-out bad sectors,
and any magnet that could suck the bits off a hard disk
was bigger than I was going to allow near my computers
or mag tape collection, thank you very much.
Floppy disks make a satisfying squooshy sound in a shredder;
remember to take the cardboard jacket off the floppy first.
Reeling out 9-track tape into a shredder is boring, but works.
I was no longer around when they sandblasted the RM05 packs,
but the sysadmin after me had a good time doing it,
and instead of the usual head-crashed RM05 platter on her wall,
she had one that was sandblasted real clean :-)
For memory, you needed to run an NSA-approved program
on your machine that would overwrite each byte three (?) times;
the trick was making sure your operating system would let you
get at everything, and of course moving the program while it
was running so it wouldn't overwrite itself.
I don't know if anyone remembered to do that after decommissioning
the VAX; we didn't do it when switching between the classified operating system diskpacks and the VMS maintenance system,
but we still maintained physical control of the system so it was OK.
Technology changes make a lot of difference in how you operate;
When we were using Vaxen with large RM05 removable disks,
we'd keep the main copy of the operating system up and running,
and needed to pay a lot of attention to security (in spite of most
of our users having the root password :-), and the disk packs
took up lots of space in the safe.  Later we started using PCs,
and any special project that didn't want to run on the main Vax
just kept a few floppies in the safe, or if it had a hard disk,
they could put the whole PC in the safe.  With Sun workstations,
we switched over to using shoebox disks, which were very convenient...
Now if I were in that business, I suppose I'd use Jazz drives,
or the large Syquest drives, and keep the operating system
on a read only hard drive...

@_subject: Re: ISP signatures on outgoing mail 
Flat-out can't work.  The problem is that you can send
SMTP directly from your machine to its destination,
so the ISP only routes the IP packets and doesn't read them.
It's popular for mail clients like Eudora and Netscape to
send all their mail to an SMTP forwarder, but the main
reasons to do that are to move the complicated work
to a machine that's on line all the time and smart enough
to deal with problems like retrying mail to systems that
don't answer, generating meaningful error messages when
the destination can't accept the mail, forwarding to
systems off in uucp-space, etc.  So it's perfectly
reasonable for mail from joeuser to originate
on Joe's PC, with no way for AOL to sign it.
There's also the problem of misconfigured Win95 machines,
where either the operating system or the operator
aren't bright enough to send the correct machine name.
For instance, this mail comes from ca07b8bl.bns.att.com,
as any system that records the HELO messages will tell you,
because when my laptop is at work, that's it's name on the LAN.
Netcom's SMTP forwarder only identifies it by IP and DNS
pax-ca8-10.ix.netcom.com(204.30.66.74) address of the
dialup port it connected to, though other servers I've
used have also passed along, or at least recorded, the ca07b8bl.
Digital signatures take a lot of calculation,
and while CPUs keep getting cheaper, mail volume keeps getting larger.
It's difficult to make server-based signing scale well, especially for the
bigger ISPs.  Netcom's farm of mail servers is large and slow enough already.
You could try to force the user to sign the mail, using a signature certified by the ISP, and only forward email that's from or to your subscribers - but checking signatures still
requires about as much calculation, and the cheaper approach of looking at the signature key without really checking the signature
is easily forged.

Not only does "Use crypto, go to jail" penalize spies with secret decoder
rings (arguably a National Security issue), and child pornographers
sending their encrypted wares to each other (arguably a police issue),
it penalizes anyone who uses a digital cellphone to call their bookie

or ask somebody for a date if they're not the politically approved gender,
or who uses IPv6 IPSEC to carry their email to their ISP on anything illegal,

have gotten the extra 5 years for saying  on an

or for using an encrypted file system on the PC where you store your Out Box

One version of the bill _did_ get changed to only penalize crypto

It might make an interesting peripheral, though, as DSPs once did.
LISP machines were nice, but it was much easier to stay on the

a 2:1 or 4:1 speed advantage is gone in 1-3 years, or faster if
somebody improves the compiler, and there are lots more people
improving compilers for mainstream machines than custom machines.
Over the years there have been reconfigurable machines.
VAXes used to have Writeable Control Store microcode;
other than an occasional bux fix or update to the machine,
the only people who used it were either very scary, very foolish,

I'm surprised the technology is reliable enough now, but if it's not, give Moore's Law another couple of years and the computers will get faster,

It's at least good enough today if you don't mind spending big bucks on
computers that'll be more affordable in a couple of years.
When San Francisco was going to close a major freeway for repairs,
they videotaped traffic, had people type in the license plates from tape,
looked them up in the DMV database, and sent them nice letters asking
them to take a different highway for the next few months.
Took a bit longer, but labor's cheap, and they didn't need instant results;
a computerized system fast enough to track cars on-line opens up a lot more possibilities, both for practical applications and abuse.
David Chaum's DigiCash was designed for applications such as tollbooths,
which would permit uncrackable payment while preserving privacy;
the technology's catching up enough to track everybody at a tollbooth
cheaply enough to make it obsolete before it's widely deployed.
You can already do it now with bar-code-like bumper stickers,
but when you can just bill for road use by license plate, there's
a lot less administration required.
And, yes, all of this privacy loss happens because somebody decided
it was convenient to put a car-ownership-tax receipt on the outside

Genuinely voluntary self-rating systems, and third-party rating-services,
are both practical and desirable for some kinds of communications.
(Mandatory systems are of course evil and inadequate.)
Not only are there people who are concerned about what their kids will see,
there are also readers who don't want to be bothered with SPAM,
readers who only want to join Better-Business-Bureau-approved MLM scams,
Usenet readers who don't want their porn diluted with phone sex ads,
web users who'd like to get further information on products without
getting junk email as well, and all sorts of applications that
don't fit well into the standard two-deadly-sins model or the
"one rating service knows all the sites you don't want to see" model.
Voluntary rating systems allow a multiplicity of values.
The latest TV ratings and V-Chip model not only can't cope with
rating news*, it also doesn't rate TV commercials -- which would score
high on greed/envy/gluttony/sugar-content/boredom,
none of which deadly sins are covered by the V-Chip scale
but are often more interesting criteria both to parents and viewers
than the sex and violence - parents know The Disney Channel isn't going
to show porn on Saturday mornings.  If your VCR also knew about ratings,
you'd be able to watch the shows commercial-free on tape...
Multiple voluntary ratings systems do mean that the information you
want to see won't always have a rating from a rating system you use;
that's the way it goes.  If it's voluntary, then some readers will set
their browsers to fail open, and some will set them to fail closed,
and some will be exposed to rating services that may offer them
other ways to find high-quality reading than the ones they use today.
And, yes, search engines that know about Interestingness ratings can be a win, if you've got some criteria that simple keyword searches
don't describe well enough to pick the best 100 of 512387 matches.
This is cyberspace.  Everybody's a bona-fide news organization.
Some are more organized than others, and some make up more of the news as they go along than others (which network blew up cars?),
and some people focus more on commentary than events or analysis,
but the oligopoly model -- a few newspapers which can afford distribution,
a few TV stations with government-granted spectrum monopolies,
and a few big wire services spoon-feeding everybody -- is dead.
Freedom of the press belongs to anyone who owns one, and that's
everyone who can afford a used PC and a free Juno account...
The big news organizations can still add a lot of value,
but there are a lot more voices in the game.
Bona Fide News Organizations during the Gulf War gave us the Pentagon Nintendo films; almost nobody went out in the battlefield reporting real news, but if Iraq had a decent Internet infrastructure we wouldn't have had to wait for Ramsey Clark's video.  The live Internet reporting during the Russian coup and the Chinese fax barrage during TienanMen Square weren't from Isvestia or the Chinese government-recognized press, but they were the real news.
*A classic example of news ratings not working are the
Vietnam war pictures of the naked girl running with napalm on her,
and the Vietnamese army officer shooting a prisoner in the head;
a V-Chip would ding them for nudity and violence, but they were
two of the most images of that war.  We were lucky those pictures
came out; any proposal that would deny the similar pictures in the
next war an open rating because it's not from a "bona fide" news org
is censorship of a sort unacceptible in a free society.

If the government wants to take over all the public commons right-of-way
and pave it for roads, I'm not saying I'm not willing to pay them
for the use of all their nice concrete and asphalt*, though government-built roads have led to a whole lot of ecological and social
problems that are far more severe than those a free-market road system
would have given us; free-marketers without eminent domain would have
built fewer roads in generally more efficient places because they'd need to make money on each one, though eminent domain may be enough of a cost-saver to make up for lower efficiency, and housing and business development would have organized more compactly around the roads and
railroads that did get built, allowing less car use.
But the government could have given us all license plates that say [StateName][Year] in big letters and the tax receipt in small letters
instead of [CarIdentifier][StateColor] in big and [Year][Receipt in small like most states do today or [CarIdentifier] in big letters on the back
and [InspectionMonth][YearColor] on the windshield like New Jersey does.
Somehow cops manage to zing people for late car tax payment anyway,
and somehow tax collectors manage to collect taxes on real estate
(which doesn't move, but has owners that do) and wages (paid by often-
mobile businesses to often-mobile workers) and sales well enough without
requiring big taxpayer id# signs on houses, wallets, and merchandise.
And somehow before the automobile we got by without license plates on
horses and buggies and cows, though some people branded their horses or cows or painted their names on buggies without the law requiring it
so they could demonstrate ownership if there was a dispute.
The choice to require easy-to-use-rapidly unique identifiers or not affects the kinds of transactions that can be done with them.
License plate numbers are primarily useful for social control,
though they're occasionally useful for recovering stolen cars
(if the thieves didn't use fake plates) or following slow white Broncos.
As computers and radio communications increase the speed and flexibility of transactions, there are more ways to use them
(cops can look up license plates any time they stop cars, allowing them
to identify dangerous criminals who are too dumb to use fake plates)
mostly for social control, but also to enforce tax collection.
They also make it easier to charge for transactions such as
bridge and freeway use - but they bias the economics towards an
account-based system (since you've got an existing key)
rather than a pay-as-you-go system (like subway tokens or turnpike tolls)
or a pay-by-the-month system (like many transit systems offer,
even for systems like BART and CalTrain that are well equipped for
distance-based billing and some bridge tolls.)  Changing the
transaction costs changes the possible relationships between
supplier and customer, and if the government wants to use them
for social control, some of those relationships make it easier.
[*There are people who refuse to get car license plates and
driver's licenses and marriage licenses and pay taxes on principle, and they spend a lot of time arguing common law to judges and cops.
I'm not one of them - as George Gordon says, if you're not having fun
doing this kind of thing, you shouldn't be wasting your time doing it,
and you also risk losing and setting bad precedents.  Our buddy Jim
Bell may or may not agree by this point in time....]

when a site sends a DNS request to your name server (e.g. because

Most safes belong to businesses that are required to
produce business records in response to warrants or maybe subpoenas;
the government doesn't need to crack the safe when it can
order the business owner to comply.  Of course, this informs the
business owner that the safe was opened, and the government
is trying to get Key Access in ways that don't inform the target.
This is an artifact of wiretapping history, and radically at
variance with the Fourth Amendment.  It would be much easier,
from a Constitutional perspective, for Congress to pass a law
that requires you to decrypt messages in response to a court order (or to turn over your keys, though that's not "narrowly tailored"),
though it makes the Fifth Amendment issues much plainer,
and doesn't make the Secret Police sufficiently happy.
Also, safes are seldom strong enough to resist cracking even if they have to
(e.g. the target is dead or can't be found or skipped the country),
while anybody can get totally uncrackable crypto systems.
Government-rated combination locks, used on safes and strongrooms
designed to store TOP SECRET information in non-battlefield environments,
are generally rated for about two hours of drilling by a
competent locksmith, and my experience is that the ratings realistically reflect the actual difficulty of cracking the lock;
I haven't tested cutting through the safe itself, but I think
they were rated for something like six hours.
The purpose of the safe is to deter crackers long enough for
other security methods such as alarms and guards to detect
and stop the attempted breakin, as well as to deter insiders.
Safes designed for SECRET and TOP SECRET use also have weight
requirements, so that crackers can't just carry them away
and crack them at leisure.  Battlefield environments probably use more guards rather than stronger safes or fancier alarms.
Banks may use vaults that are tougher than that;
the classic bank burglary novel/movie involves defeating the
alarm system and working around the guards to either
dynamite the lock or break through the back wall over the weekend
(taking advantage of the time lock that prevents the
bank employees from getting in until Monday and noticing the hit.)

text input any differently that raw bits, and it's worth taking whatever
input you have and compressing it to reduce the amount of data the
encryption and transmission phases need to handle.  Producing printable
ASCII as an output format isn't a cryptography issue - it's just a simple reversable transform from a bunch of raw bits to printable,
and there's no excuse for inventing a new format rather than using
MIME encoding, uuencode, or btoa, unless you're doing something extremely
creative with Unicode...  Producing output as English-like words is more interesting.
It's a steganography issue, not a cryptography issue, since you should
be doing the secure part first anyway, but it can be useful for
obscuring the fact that you're using crypto in a message.
The canonical reference is to Peter Wayner's Mimic Functions,
which let you model an arbitrary context-free grammar for output,
but you should also look around for "texto".  (The other canonical
reference is to "PHB", Dilbert's program that disguises the message
in Pointy Haired Boss jargon, but I'm not aware that anyone's written it.)
A good book to read on cryptois Bruce Schneier's "Applied Cryptography",
which discusses most of the current algorithms and how they're used.
There are no legal restrictions on cryptography strength in the US;
only restrictions on what's exportable, and even then you need permission. #			Thanks;  Bill

@_subject: Gary Burnore Arrested at Critical Mass 
Those of you in the San Francisco area have seen headlines
about the Critical Mass monthly bicycle rides around San Francisco
and about how Da Mayor and the police decided to control them
(as if telling an anarchy what to do is productive for anyone)
and arrested 250 people, some for running red lights, but
many for failing to disperse, as near as I can tell from the papers.
It was overall a fun evening, though my brakes weren't really
up to Lombard Street :-)
Anyway, Gary Burnore, scourge of the remailers, was arrested.  According to the paper, he wasn't really sure why; the police didn't give people enough time to disperse
before massly arresting them for not dispersing.
The city district attorney _has_ informed Da Mayor that the city can't
just confiscate the bikes that were seized along with the riders;
apparently it's not part of the law :-)  On the other hand,
that doesn't mean they necessarily have to give them back
right away, as opposed to holding them as evidence.

They're illegal in the US primarily because the Post Office is confused

delivery of obscenity by mail is.  It's a side effect of having services

On the Internet, on the other hand, not only is the stuff spam and a scam,
but it's abusing flat-rate prices for service, and service providers

@_subject: Dorothy Denning changes Escrow position 
There was an article in today's San Jose Mercury News that
Dorothy Denning, the leading academic supporter of the Administration's
anti-crypto stance, has backed off from that position.
She's put out a paper along with William Baugh of SAIC (!) which among other things includes a survey of law enforcement officers
on how much they've encountered crypto and how much difference it's made,
and the answer has been that it hasn't made much difference --
of the few criminals who use crypto, some use wimpy algorithms,
some are careless with their password handling, some get fingered by
stool pigeons, and some mainly use their crypto for information
not relevant to the case they're being investigated for.
She's now taking a much less certain, more neutral position.
Way to go, Dorothy!
It's especially important because Dr. Denning was the main independent
supporter of encryption limitations, and has a lot of reputation invested
in it, so changing her position is a big step.  The FBI has a vested
interest - without Communists to chase around, Director Freeh is off chasing drug dealers in the name of "national security".  And the industrial support for key escrow has primarily been from companies that get to export their products in return for adding it, though there have been a few firms like TIS that have developed it for its own sake.

That's fine - if we wanted people to oppose crypto-censorship on
moral or political grounds, we could ask the ACLU or EFF or CypherpunkCabal.
Professor Denning's position has never been that eavesdropping and
key escrow are required on the grounds of principle - it's
Louis Freeh's job to say "we can't go upsetting Law Enforcement's
traditional ability to eavesdrop on you, that'd be UnAmerican".
Her important contributions to the Bad Guys' position has been to say that
"Law enforcement needs your keys because there's no practical alternative",
which reinforces the FBI's and NSA's arguments.  Now that she's saying
"Law enforcement doesn't really need your keys, they're doing just fine
without them, even in spite of all the insider talks they've given me"
that knocks the utilitarian leg out from under them.  That's very good.
Won't stop the Bad Guys from trying, of course, but it's a good start.
On the other hand, it'll probably provide extra ammunition for the current
"legalize exports but criminalize use of crypto in crime" bills,
which gives the government more power than they've had before domestically
at the cost of losing the export battle which they were losing anyway.

@_subject: Re: bulk postage fine (was Re: non-censorous spam control) 
Hear, hear!  The fax law says precisely that you can't send a fax
without correct identification of the sender, and an email equivalent
law would do the same.  (Anonymous remailers wouldn't necessarily be
banned, as long as they identified themselves correctly; if anything
this would probably encourage deployment of remailers, mainly by spammers,
which is a mixed blessing.)  Also, there are several Supreme Court cases,
such as McIntyre vs. Ohio, that strongly uphold the right to anonymous
publication; the fax law probably violates this, though I doubt it's been
taken to court.  The issue of the cost to the receipient of junk faxes
was the justification for the junk fax laws; I've heard that
Spamford himself was the junk faxer who they were a response to,
though I haven't seen any verification of that, and of course
widespread caller-id could have taken care of the problem without
requiring a Federal law.
One obvious implementation of identification would of course be a
Key Management Infrastructure...  They might not do it, not only because
it would require everyone to change their email programs, but more
seriously because it would require everyone to use encryption-capable
mailers (or at least signature-capable), and even with 40-bit escrowed
mail, it makes eavesdropping much more work.

More to the point, if you're charging prices that don't reflect the
true costs of the activities, it'll catch up with you after a while;
either the Tacky People will find a way to siphon money out of the system
by some variant on spamming, or it won't have the same community you're looking for, because it's only used by people willing to pay extra for the service, or because the information flow that used to be provided free
gets stifled, or somebody will offer a competing system that offers similar features at a lower cost, or whatever.
Somehow Usenet has survived growing from a system small enough to read
all the mail to a system with gigabytes of traffic per day,
and it's still possible to find some signal among the noise
(though the Web has siphoned off much of that signal.)
And we've grown from tens of thousands of students and defense contractors
on the Arpanet and UUCP and Fido nets and BBSs to tens of millions of users on the Internet.  Filtering tools help find the interesting
parts of the global discussion, and make it easier to get rid of
the uninteresting parts.  The present situation is that the social dynamics and economics are such
that Tacky People can make money by being rude to everyone without being interesting in return.  While trying to charge money for communications
may work, I'm inclined to doubt it; the more interesting currency to
try to model is Reputation, which leads to more like an Ender's Game
kind of net, or to semi-closed communities like the Well (is?was?).

- The mixture of rewebbers and TAZ servers is interesting;
you can either have or  as the URL,
providing different kinds of security.  The former makes it easier
to find stuff, since the documents can have meaningful names,
though //ENCRYPTED_PATH_AND_DOC// can point to //PATH1.TAZ/index.html which can point you to the encrypted URLs for document1.html,
document2.html, etc.
- You were awfully nice to the Onion Router folks; my take on their
smaller set of features vs. PipeNet is that they didn't think of  the
other attacks.  On the other hand, they were funded and working on a
project for their jobs, so they did do the work to finish and implement it,
which is of course a Good Thing.
- Elliptic curve flavors of public-key are probably valuable.
Nobody understands them well enough to explain to the non-math-wizard (:-),
but they do appear to use substantially shorter keys and outputs.
- Proxy caching is a mixed blessing.  While caching does increase the
difficulty of traffic analysis by reducing the number of requests that
chain through to the end server, it increases the ability of Bad Guys to
trace through the network using subpoenas, warrants, rubber hoses, or
basic system cracking, because it leaves a trail of cached documents.
Each system still has to be compromised to discover the next link in
the chain, but caching makes it easier to verify that a compromise
has been successful.
- While rewebbers are less likely to be spammed than remailers,
and less likely to annoy users, they're still annoying to the
Powers That Be.  The obvious attacks on the rewebber system are to
post Scientologist Child Porn WareZ on the well-known rewebbers, post announcements to Usenet about its availability, and
let the CoS and the Postal Inspectors go after them one by one.

The actual data is encrypted with IDEA, but the identical IDEA key is encrypted with each recipient's RSA key.  To avoid this attack,
PGP uses random padding after the IDEA key (which makes the message

Since IDEA keys are 128 bits long, and RSA moduli are typically 384-2047,

@_subject: Another Free Email Site with remailer possibilities 
Www.Iname.com is yet another free email site.  Its business model
is to offer free email forwarding from basic accounts
(paid for by advertising attached to the bottom of the mail),
with fancier-looking accounts and POP mailboxes for extra money.
They have very explicit anti-spam policies, but I'm not sure if
they really hunt down spammers, or if they just respond to complaints
by shutting off accounts and keeping the $0 or $15.
The policies would be no problem for a subscription-only exit remailer,
presumably no problem for a entry-only or middleman remailer,
and appear to ban non-subscription-based exit remailers.
They may or may not have a problem with the type of remailer that
sends a non-registered user a note saying "You've got anonymous mail;
send this cookie if you want to receive it"; my guess is they probably
drop free accounts after one complaint.
The free accounts look like username or a few other
lame domain names like cyberdude.com; one of them is "earthling.net", and I suspect the spammer who sent me mail
from one of those accounts was trying to pretend to be from earthlink.net ; I've probably blocked both of them by now.
You can only have one free account per destination address.
The advertising attached to the bottom of the mail messages
shouldn't be a problem for PGP-only remailers, assuming they
use some tolerable format and don't try to package your mail
in some MIME or HTML wrappers.  I can't tell, because they say
they won't start attaching ads until the extra-price-option
ad-remover software is available RSN.
The non-free accounts cost $15/year (first 60 days free)
for wider collection of domain names (including mail.com, which is usable, and some pure spam-bait names including seductive.com and credit4u.com.)
POP3 mailboxes cost $24/year.
Their security is really spotty - they use SSL for things
related to your bill, but not for passwords, at least for
free accounts....  It's easy to set up an account that
forwards mail to some third party; if you want to control
the thing, you have to point it to yourself first,
have it send you the password and confirmation,
then go log in to the member page and change your mail forwarding destination.  So it's unfortunately easy
to spam the innocent with an account at innocent.com
(they don't have guilty.com, though :-)
I've set up remailer1 to point to
winsock  , which is a PGP-only remailer.
It'll expire in 60 days, unless someone wants to spend money,
but that's why it's remailer1
It's got one of the usual passwords.

Not obvious at all - spammers have harvester programs that
hunt down new web pages to find spammer targets,
and since three of the different spammer groups are hitting you,
that's probably what happened.
Perl is a nice language to write such things in, but you won't
get huge quantities of people implementing it, except perhaps Linux users.
You need an executable that'll run on Win3.1 or Win95 (sigh);
a user interface letting you input different targets is also good.
However, that doesn't really block the spammers who buy a list of
N million targets and send spam out from their own machines,
though shutting down Spamford and Harris Marketing would help,

The advantage is that it doesn't need to be online, and being online

For some applications, such as wallets, being online means trusting the
telecom facilities provided by the person you're exchanging money with,
which also requires more protocol support.
There is another approach, which is the observer stuff from Stefan Brands,

Diffie-Hellman keys have different standards for how long they
need to be, since they're based on discrete logs rather than factoring,
but the necessary lengths are similar.  However, generating
Diffie-Hellman keys is much faster, once you've settled on a modulus,
since you don't need to search for probable primes, you just
need to pick a random number that's relatively prime to the modulus-1 (trivial, if you're using a Sophie-Germain prime modulus)
and maybe to the generator (also trivial.)  So go for 4096,
or a least use a much longer key than the 192 bits Sun once used :-).
There's no particular reason _not_ to support 4096-bit RSA keys (since using dynamic-sized data structures makes programs more reliable and less susceptible to attacks like overly-long input data), but there's also really no need for keys longer than 2048 bits unless
some radical algorithmic breakthrough happens.  (Computer hardware breakthroughs aren't relevant; the exponential behaviour of the
algorithms mean that a few extra bits makes any device that fits
on the planet still too small.)  1024 bits is probably enough,
but maybe not, depending on how long you need to keep something secret
and how much technology improves doing your lifetime.  Techniques for breaking into your computer and stealing the private key
will probably improve far faster than cracking algorithms,
especially as 1) Nanotech makes it much easier to recover old data off disks and
send nanobots to collect and return it
2) The Singularity makes people smart enough to find all the security
bugs in Win2001
3) The Fingertip Escrow Act requires recording of all keystrokes and

While Usenet is becoming a vaster wasteland by the month,

that's fine, because there's more noise to hide your signal in,
and it doesn't really matter if it's 98% spam as long as your

The more interesting problem with Usenet is that it no longer
operates in the old flood-routing fashion, where everybody had
all the news they could handle on their machines and could
quietly grub the articles they wanted out of /usr/spool/news,
and a 300...1200...9600 baud modem could receive it all.
Instead, news tends to be exchanged between servers that can
handle the flood of 1+ GB/day, and news clients download the articles they want from the servers, which makes it much easier to
monitor who's actually reading what, though you could still get
a feed of alt.anonymous.messages or alt.binaries.pictures.stego
without the Traffic Analysts knowing which messages were for you.
Some counters to this may be to use services like DejaNews to read
the news through web anonymizers (if you trust them), or to
build news retrieval features into remailers (if you trust them,
and preferably with a pay-per-retrieval system so the remailer

No, they have high rates of arrest and conviction for law violations,
primarily drug laws.  Yes, there's also crime, but that's a separate problem.
Last time I ran the numbers, the estimated free-market cost of medical-quality heroin is less than $1/day, and cocaine about $3/day;
the coke figures are from Bush's 1989 drug-control policy.
All the crime and violence involved in the black-market trade is because
somebody's convinced society that there's a serious moral difference
between a junkie and a drunkard, and that Government Needs A War To Fix It.
I work in San Francisco, where there are junkies and drunkards begging
on the street corners (except when the cops run them off for annoying the
politer classes), and I've noticed that most of them can afford tobacco;
the real cost of politically less correct drugs is about the same.
So if you want the State sending the junkie's welfare check to the
theft victims, you should also ask them to send the drug cops's paycheck
as well.  Because they're partners in crime.
But this isn't a cypherpunks issue any more, unless we note that,

there'd be a lot less need for Anguillan remailers, Swiss bank accounts,

@_subject: Re: an end to "courts" (was RE: An end to "court appointed attorneys" ) 
In most kinds of welfare, the state is pretending to "help" the recipient
by protecting them against the real world, whether it's the difficulties
of finding food, medical care, or whatever; it's a job that really belongs to private charity, though arguably government may provide
more help by inefficiently spending large amounts of theft-funded money
vs. efficiently spending smaller amounts of voluntary money and labor.
Public defenders are a different case, however - the attacks the
government is protecting the recipient against are attacks by the
government itself, and the cost of hiring a lawyer to defend him against
the government may be as severe a punishment as the offence in question.
OJ may have been able to outspend the prosecution in an attempt to
obtain justice or evade it, but you can't.
Court-funded attorneys are obviously in a conflict of interest, even in non-political crimes, and the government isn't overly enthusiastic about funding them well, and they're usually not as good as the ACLU would be, but on the other hand they _will_ often provide some help for cases the ACLU doesn't bother with.
How much they're there to really help, and how much their purpose is
to let the government pretend it's being fair, is a toss-up.
But the average citizen, who doesn't deal with the court end of
government every day or every year, has a minimal chance of justice
without competent legal assistance, or without spending more time
than the average prosecution cycle learning how the courts work.
Well, Johnnie was right about that.  The police had decided (probably
correctly) that OJ was the most likely murderer, and had set out to
convict him, doing it sloppily and in ways that tainted the evidence.
Bad lab procedures, which were apparently a problem, made it possible
to mix up samples (even if they weren't doing it deliberately),
as well as to interpret the tests in the most pro-conviction way.
And because the police were quite public about their accusations,
they were under pressure to get the conviction, by any means necessary. One of the important principles of American justice, such as it is,
is that people are supposed to be innocent unless they're really
proven guilty, beyond reasonable doubt, and that it's better to
fail to convict an occasional guilty person than to convict an
innocent person - especially when the penalty may be death.
The police botched their case terribly, and they deserved to lose.
The jury did the right thing in not accepting it.
On the other hand, the civil jury that stuck it to OJ financially
also did the right thing; there _was_ a lot of evidence that he did it,
to the level of proof required for a civil case.
Especially for politically sensitive cases, but sometimes in simple ones,
police often jump to conclusions, and hide or ignore evidence that
would exonerate the accused, and courts usually buy there stories;
in spite of that, we keep seeing people #			Thanks;  Bill

2**N / log N or 2**(N/3) or some other relationship that's

you a substantially different amount of work to double the amount of

I disagree.  We'd lose, and setting bad precedent is worse than none
or weak precedents.  The important conclusion Judge Patel drew was that
source code is clearly speech (yay!  and blatantly obvious, as well :-)
The next obvious directions to go, after we win the appeal,
are to solidify the judgement with more source code (and deal with the fact that they'll keep changing the regulations), especially if we can do a source code in an interpreted language like perl,
and then maybe go after binary code as speech.
We'll also need to do something about the Karn case,
since the difference between source code on paper and source code on a floppy is obviously not a legitimate one.
If you do hardware, they'll say "Hardware isn't speech, it's stuff,
and exporting stuff is commerce, and we can regulate commerce and exports",
and they'll be right constitutionally if not morally.
Exporting the detailed plans for encryption hardware might be fun,
especially if the hardware is very generic (say, a speech card for
a Nintendoid with some crypto firmware for the Nintendoid's CPU, or a cellphone-modem with crypto pumpware.)
About the only Real Hardware I can see having a chance is
some sort of ASIC-based device like a pocket organizer or cashcard
that does encryption as an incidental part of some other function,
such as an authentication protocol.  But if it's a cash card,
the rules have been flexible enough to handle permits for banking-only devices, and you don't get an interesting Constitutional case
about being wrongly denied an export permit when they give you
a permit, or at least give out permits for functionally similar products.
I suppose there'd be some hack value in exporting a smart-cellphone
with downloadable firmware/javaware (e.g. for multiple language support)
with all the right export permits, and then releasing the crypto code from replay or kremvax or  , and using it as precedent
for your application for exporting the crypto-equipped version.

As with many government programs, and many attempts to fix them,
it's going for the wrong problem, and tieing in to a lot of emotional
hidden agendas.  The real problems are that we'd rather not keep paying money to people many of us disapprove of, and that doing so in the way that it's been done has failed badly, and created an underclass of
more people that we disapprove of that are getting money, as well as
an overclass of welfare bureaucrats who do a better job of evading disapproval, and the whole process tends to create lots of hostility,
in no small part because not only is having to live on the dole demeaning,
but lots of people (including the above-mentioned bureaucrats) want to
make sure it's as demeaning as a modern liberal society will allow.
The obvious approach to the problem of people on welfare getting more
money if they have kids is not to refuse their right to have kids,
it's to not give them more welfare money.  Regardless of the consequences.
(Private charity is a totally different case, none of the government's business, though the government has corrupted a lot of the big players
like Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army into running welfare
subcontracting with government money.)  Maybe the way to implement it
is to cap the monthly amount, maybe it's to cap the lifetime amount
(so welfare mothers know that if they want more money this month
based on having more kids, they'll get fewer years of support.)
Milton Friedman's socialistic approach to the problem, the Negative
Income Tax, is also a partial win.  It proposes that the paternalistic
welfare bureaucrats haven't done much good in reducing the
number of people dependent on welfare, so fire them.
Use the well-known evil bureaucracy, the IRS, and have it just give money
back to people with sufficiently low incomes.  Maybe you'll get more
welfare recipients who aren't the "deserving poor", but so what;
probably there will be fewer "welfare queens" multi-dipping,
and maybe even there'll be more welfare mothers with (gasp)
their husbands or boyfriends living with them, but you'll have
also gotten rid of a class of parasitic bloodsuckers who've probably
contributed substantially to the dependency of the poor,
and saved enough money to make up for the extra undeserving poor.
[ObCryptoPolicyContent]  After we get rid of those bloodsucking bureaucrats,
or maybe even before, we can make it harder for the IRS to stay in business
as well, by moving much of the economy out of their reach into cash :-)
And the off-the-books cash economy is not unfamiliar to the poor, either;
maybe we can learn some tips from them....]

And his web page says
The toolkit is fairly straightforward, if the descriptions are accurate.
Alice exchanges a secret with Bob somehow, and keeps track of which secret goes with which recipient, i.e. does the key management - either inside the toolkit, making the toolkit somewhat useful, or outside the toolkit, making the toolkit annoying to use.
At that point, Alice and Bob both have Secret(Alice,Bob),
and a counter N of the number of session keys they've generated.
When Alice wants to send Message to Bob, she uses the toolkit to calculate
and sends Bob (N,Stuff1,Stuff2,Alice,Bob) and E(Message,SessionKey(N)).
Having not licensed a copy of the toolkit, I don't know whether
Stuff1 and Stuff2 are transmitted, non-transmitted, or empty sets,
or whether the function f  maintains state other than N (if it does,
then Stuff1 and Stuff2 are the state variables, with Stuff1(N+1)==Stuff2(N).)
Some popular variants on this are
Then there's S/Key: f() = Hash**(M-N)(Secret) where M is a big number,
typically 100.
This works well for passwords, since you can easily verify that
Hash**N(f()) = Secret,

key cracks

According to some article on some mailing list, SAFE appears to be dead;
the chairman of one of the relevant committees believes too strongly in
"National Security" to be willing to let it out.  On the other hand,
if it does get out, the ACLU and CDT lobbied some words into it that
would at least limit the use-a-crypto penalties to crimes that are
Federal criminal felonies, so jaywalking while using a cellphone doesn't get hit (unlike jaywalking while carrying an assault BBgun.)
It's still seriously wrong, of course, but at least the number of cases
that it applies to is substantially reduced, though the number of Federal felonies keeps increasing at an appalling rate.
If SAFE does go through, I'm sure someone will get busted for selling drugs while using a cellphone, with the prosecution arguing
that since the cellphone is capable of interstate phone calls,
the drug deal is a Federal crime and not just state, and therefore
the use-crypto-go-to-jail applies...

got busted for the drugs he was carrying, and appealed.
The Supremes basically ruled that he should have known his rights,
was not under arrest, and could have refused to consent, but that since he did consent to the intimidating well-armed gentlemen
blocking his exit from the bus, it's not their problem.   Not the kind of ruling I'd hope for, but it does at least make it clear

No, they put out an interim report asserting that Skipjack was secure,

and hyped the  out of how secure Skipjack was, implying that you should trust Clipper and the friendly NSA that gave it to
Of course, N years later, they haven't come out with that final report,
and in context issuing the Skipjack interim part was a blatantly dishonest
as well as being too short an analysis to be anything resembling thorough,
even if Skipjack is fairly strong (which it probably is, for 80 bit Feistel.)
Not an extremely practical break, but good enough to show the
fundamental shoddiness of the Clipper system and embarass them at a time
that a good heavy-duty embarassment was politically damaging.
I think they've got a role in making sure that defense contractors
making products for the US military, whether the contractors are handling militarily sensitive information or especially building tools that the
military will use to handle sensitive information, are adequately secure.
You could argue that that's a job for some other centralized expert agency
that's under better civilian control or Pentagon control rather than
being out of control (as the CIA is), perhaps National Science Foundation,
but it's also arguable that the only people who can do an adequate job
of protecting secrets are people with lots of practice cracking them,
and that's something pretty much like an NSA.
There's also a potential role, though it's a much tougher sell,
for NSA or similar experts helping the State Department,
and perhaps civilian Federal agencies that handle private information about citizens, do a good job at protecting it,
though the military models of security are often not a good match
for civilian data protection.  My past experience with the NSA
"helping" the State Department was a 3-year debacle in the late 80s,
where they provided a bunch of unrealistic wish-list advice to a bunch of,
ummm, technically challenged Wang administrators about how to build
a secure world-wide network, which gradually fell apart in turf battles
because the main Embassy customers for highly secure communications
don't really work for State and they wanted their secure network provided by Real Spooks, and they may not have had the budget or political
clout to get a network built but they could sure spoil a procurement :-)
But other than supporting Federal customers, they ought to leave business alone, at least until they get privatized....

Lockheed only gave one political contribution in 1993, before this

1992 was an election year, 1994 was Congressional elections,

Good user interfaces and high speed are important, but not enough.
How strong is the cypher?  Where is the academic research behind it?
What is the algorithm?  Why should we trust it?  Who else has tested it?
Other people have built cyphers based on chaotic systems, and found
they were weak when analyzed properly.  Building good cryptosystems is
The web page doesn't give any details about the algorithm,
except saying that it uses chaos and strange attractors,
uses variable-length keys, and has a structure that uses
XOR of the stream cypher with the plaintext.
It does say the algorithm has a 0-1 balance of 0.5/0.5 (which any good cryptosystems do) and has a medium-sized state space (2**96).
It claims that because it's a one-way stream cypher, that makes it
safe against chosen plaintext attacks.  That's not true.
Choose a plaintext of all zeros, and that gives you the
output of the chaotic system which you can analyze for patterns.
If you know the structure of the chaotic system, you can
analyze the mathematics to see how to find the state space,
and how to find the future output from the current output and
the state space - if the algorithm is strong, this is difficult,
but if the algorithm is weak, this is easy.  If you don't publish
the algorithm, nobody can prove that it's strong, and in the
world of cryptosystems, that means nobody will trust it,
because we know how weak many other strong-looking algorithms are.

There has been work like this done before, though I don't have references
Check Schneier's "Applied Cryptography".  It hasn't been very successful -
the output of the system looks very random, but you can predict each value
from the last, so known plaintext attack kills it.  And even if the
mathematics are strong, the implementation can be weak.
How long are Xn and Ch(n)?  Double (64-bit IEEE floating point)?
Is 0f(K)
How is f(K) used?  Initialize Ch(0)?  What is strtoul?  String to Unsigned Long?
If size(w) == ul == 32 bits, you only have a 32-bit key, too weak.
If size(w) == 64 bits, maybe you have a chance.
Be sure each piece of K(j) is long enough - adding a bunch of
short numbers together does not produce a long number.
An MD5 hash would be much better.
How do you XOR a plaintext byte with (double) Ch(i)?
Do you really just use 1 byte of the Ch(i)?  Then you may have a chance.
If you use all the bits of Ch(i), then known plaintext lets you
take C(i) XOR P(i) == Ch(i), which lets you generate Ch(i+1)....
You may not know the key, but you don't need to if you know the function.

at least a bunch of fabrication intended to add verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative.  The amount of framework it would
take to do an escrow system capable of handling every key from Verisign
and Netscape is substantially beyond anything anyone was really funded for;
much easier to do the job for a few thousand Clipperphones, and build infrastructure as sales pick up.  Building an infrastructure for a system
that has keys generated by users, by the millions, is much harder than building one for a small centralized system.

Wrong - the more time we have to deploy crypto, get the world used to it,
and make it an indispensible part of the industry, the more infrastructure
there is.
Infrastructure is good, and if we build some and they tear it down,
that's just more people lobbying against the Bad Guys.
Suppose the Feds tell half the country they need to replace their new
Bad enough they have to replace their Verisign key that all their Netscape

Also, an early ban means the infrastructure gets built with Big Brother

cellphone needs a Social Security Signature Number to operate so they can find
your Voluntary Escrow Key, and every bank transaction is required to be

need names, only authorizations.  And there's a whole lot of digital cash infrastructure to be built, that's only starting emerge
as the big financial institutions get on board.  If crypto gets banned early,
there's no chance of a Chaumian or agnostic or even vaguely private
system getting adopted, and once the Bad Infrastructure is in place,
it doesn't matter if the laws get relaxed, because the banks won't change.
The timing is especially sensitive because the Diffie-Hellman patent
just expired, and Merkle-Hellman and Hellman-Pohlig go next month,
and the whole field becomes legal for Americans to work in without
license restrictions and for Non-North-Americans to write software
they can sell in the US without licensing.  That means there should be
a lot of new products emerging in the next year or so -
and Escrowed Key Certification Authorities are especially silly in a Diffie-Hellman environment, where you're using the registered part of your key
to sign a random half-key used to generate the session key....
Momentum is good - more people working around it, and more people
working against it, and more people hassling their Congresscritters.
No, the sooner it goes into effect, the later the things built with it
go away.  Think of all the places your Social Security Number has spread,
partly by design and partly because it's a convenient database key.
Will your Public Key Infrastructure ID be on all your digital transactions?
Who's going to bother replacing that with the infrastructure needed for
Web Of Trust business relationships?
Furthermore, in an Escrowed Society, encryption gets built with the
id and signatures on the outside and the privacy inside, so it's easy to trace
whose communication you're wiretapping.  That kind of architecture
isn't easily replaced, even if the key is no longer escrowed,
so traffic analysis becomes easy even after message reading becomes harder.

1) Anonymity is easy.  Not only can you be the chief of this pyramid,
you can be some of the accomplices, and even some of the suckers generating cash flow to the accomplices so they can demonstrate
how great a system this is.  And nobody knows you're the dog.
2) Economics often determines activities, and the economics of the
margin are as important as the economics of the whole system.
Yes, the system is bad for everybody except the sellers of telephone wire,
but if anyone thinks they can locate suckers fast enough to take in more money
than they spend locating the suckers, and they have low enough ethics, some of them will try.  Since there are many people out there with low ethics
and a high estimate of the number of suckers, and since the costs
of communicating to a large number of people on the Internet is very low,
many of them will try, and some will succeed, and all of them will send you
junk mail.
Illegal doesn't matter, only practical matters.
Lotteries also lose money, except for the people selling tickets,
but the government permits them when the government gets the money.
Pyramid scams are also a form of lottery, where it's easier to affect your
odds of being the winner or loser, depending on the number of suckers you know
and the extent to which you're a sucker yourself.

the fact that the remailer waited 3 days before sending out the one message it

Lucky's point that traffic analysts can learn a lot because messages decrease
in size in type-1 remailer networks is important; Mixmaster's constant-size
message blocks are probably the best way to go (though you then need
more random interblock latency), but the ability to have each remailer
add padding is important if you don't use fixed-size blocks, and I'm not aware

remailers that randomly pick another remailer to chain through to reach

@_subject: Encrypting Pagers is Easy!   [Overview, technical tradeoffs, crypto] 
One of the articles on the White House Pager Hack quoted a government official
saying that encrypting pagers would be complicated and difficult.
In fact, it's available today from several sources:
1)Digital PCS, in TDMA, GSM1900, and CDMA, though US coverage isn't complete   (as of May 97, AT&T had service in 40% of the US land area, 80% population,   and the GSM1900 players are expecting wide coverage later this year
  (e.g. PacBell and OmniPoint), plus Sprint PCS and other players are there.)
  There's a white paper on AT&T's Digital PCS at   which talks somewhat about the security.  Phil Karn's posted some articles   in the past about on the NSA's armtwisting that kept the cellphone
  from being strong enough for serious security, but if it's not good
enough for
  the White House, that's somewhat their fault.
2)Motorola's extremely cool PageWriter 2000 is a ~2"x2" programmable beeper
  with keyboard, 160x240 screen, crypto, operating system, and infrared.
    says it uses the Flex Operating System and ReFLEX 2-way paging;
  the person who showed me the beta version said OS9 and GSM.
  I'd guess that Flex is OS9 with bells and whistles added, and that
  the pager's CPU is a 68000-family chip, and that either he's wrong about
  GSM or there's a second flavor coming out that does GSM.
  In any case, it's user-programmable, and Motorola has crypto support.
3)If you insist on pager service that's not part of the cellphone or beeper
  you were carrying already, or want wider coverage, it's still not very hard,
  and it can be done with or without the paging service's cooperation.  4)PCMCIA cards in your PDA can get alpha pager, CDPD, ARDIS, RadioMail, etc.
A cypherpunk replied that the difficulty is the fault of US anti-crypto
policy.  It's also the fault of spectrum licensing policies creating a small number of  players in most markets and restricting what they can do "in the public interest", which has slowed deployment of new radio technology.
Making money at it may still be hard, since the government interference
fragments on the market and raises costs, but that's a separate problem, and if you can piggyback on existing developments like PCS and CDPD, it's a lot easier.   Technology tradeoffs
Pager-company approaches vs. end-user-based - for the former, you have to
convince the pager service and hardware companies there's a market;
for the latter, you don't change the service, just send encrypted data
using the alpha pager protocols, and soup up your pager to decrypt it.
For PCS or CDPD or other radio data systems, it's also just data.
If the pager company does the encryption, it's vulnerable to wiretaps and
Relays - in a user-based system, you can either have the message sender
do the encryption, which means distributing your code and keys widely,
or run a relay box, e.g. Web page with SSL that handles the crypto and paging,
letting people who want to page you use a standard web browser.
Pager technology vs. crypto horsepower - basic pagers don't have a lot of
horsepower, but a general-purpose 8-bit processor chip should be able to do
RC4 in near-real-time, and maybe other symmetric-key algorithms. Public-key needs more horsepower - is it too slow for a pager-sized system?
Digital cellphones use plenty of CPU to handle voice and dumb crypto,
in not much more space, though they do use a lot more battery.
If you don't want to custom-build your own pagers, use a pager card in a PDA -
the Newton's had this for a while, and has a RISC CPU, so it's fast,
and there are HP DOS-based palmtops which are slower, though the new
Windows CE machines are probably faster than the previous generation.
There'll probably be Pilot PCMCIA versions, though that's slower,
and you can use Pilot with Metricom today and use Ian's PGP tools.
The upcoming Psion 5 uses a StrongArm CPU; don't know if it does PCMCIA.
Crypto issues
What about the crypto protocols themselves?  Public-key is straightforward; if you use 1024-bit keys you can even skip
Secret key has more choices, with varying vulnerabilities
- shared secret with pager company - dumb, works fine, you'd probably have the
- user-managed relay from public-key to user's secret-key - - in either of these cases, you'd probably want to use the shared secret key

The relay approaches let your users send you pages without knowing your

[Guns aren't really a cypherpunks topic, though the below-mentioned
clueless power-hungry terrorists do use the Internet and crypto
to help maintain their position relative to their victims and to
other competing clueless power-hungry terrorists.]
I used to take the traditional U.S. Liberal-Statist view that Guns Are Bad,
and Guns Need Controlling.  But the way Americans and Europeans control guns
is to hire a bunch of armed thugs and use them to terrorize the population
into giving these people their guns and not buying more.  And, well,
I decided it was pretty hypocritical to hire armed thugs to take away
peoples' guns at gunpoint.  I had to give up that position.
(A Conservative-Statist wouldn't have any contradiction - the rabble
can't be trusted with guns, so we'll take them away at gunpoint,
and we'll be safer.  Trust us.  Or we'll shoot you too.  No problem :-)
Now, if the Amish want to do gun control, it's a different story.
If people want to keep around guns for killing people, keep talking to them about it until they reform, and if that doesn't work,
_stop_ talking to them until they reform.  No hypocrisy, no problem.
Those things are fine, but one of the big reasons people shoot each other
in this country is fighting over the money involved in the Black Market
for drugs.  After all, in a War On , you can't expect one side
to do all the shooting.  All this crime and violence over drugs with a
free-market value of <$3/day for coke and <$1/day for heroin.  You'd think the people in power are either ravingly clueless or they like Power for its own sake.  And you certainly shouldn't trust either
the clueless or the power-greedy to do the right thing with guns...
The traditional solution to day care was people taking care of each other's kids, either within the family or their neighbors, at home.  Do-gooder liberals have made this more difficult by making laws mandating
quality control over day care, government certification for day care workers,
and safety certifications that the average home has trouble getting.
So the single parent can't show their kids a productive lifestyle by
taking care of the neighbors' kids for money, which would also free up
the neighbors to work.  And it's not just single parents who do this,
it's married women whose husbands aren't making enough to support them
in an Ozzie&Harriet lifestyle.
I do agree with you that blowing away the neighbor's teenager who's
trying to steal you TV isn't a good thing.  If it's just the kid,
he'll be gone before your police get there, and if it's someone dangerous
you may not have a chance to call them.  I keep a fire-extinguisher
by the bed, not only for fires, but for shooting first, asking questions
later, and clubbing them with as a fallback.  :-)  On the other hand,
back when I lived in Jersey, one of those grannies y'all were worried about
was on the front page of her local paper holding her pistol --
"Police?  Are you kidding?  They don't come to _my_ neighborhood, it's too dangerous!"

There are remailer programs for both Hotmail (web-based) and Juno (dialup),
and several people are actually operating remailers from Juno.
The remailers accept mail un the usual fashion, including PGP support,
and take care of working around the advertising that comes with the free mail.
Both services have anti-spamming terms of service, which probably block
general-purpose remailers from them because they send unsolicited mail
to non-previously-consenting users.  But there's no problem with the TOS
in running remailers that only send mail to subscribed users,
and it may or may not be acceptable to run the kind of remailer that sends
"Subject: You have anonymous mail - message reply to pick it up"
and doesn't bother the user further unless they ask for the mail.
I also don't know about posting to Usenet from them.
So what can you do with a limited-target-area remailer?
- Entry remailer, with well-known name, that only forwards - Middleman remailer, accepting mail only from remailers and sending
- nymserver target remailers, though obviously if you're the only
- forwarders to message pools
- subscription-only remailers.
- maybe spam filters?

Sameer's C2.Net used to be an ISP business, providing privacy services,

that it was a real pain to support.  Similarly, remailer operators often
spend a lot of time dealing with spammers and harassers.  (An important part
of the job is maintaining blocking lists of people who don't want mail.)
However, you can keep track of your anonymous customers - have them use
pseudonyms, e.g. PGP signatures maintaing a consistent identity even though
you don't know the True Name of the customer or whether one customer is using multiple pseudonyms, and if you kill off one customer you can't
be sure they won't come back with a new pseudonym.
For the most part, that security involves three aspects
- making sure you get paid (so make anonymous customers pay in advance)
- keeping one customer from cracking into your system and your other customers'
- not having cops raiding you or angry global villagers with flamethrowers showing up.

Raph Levien's remailer pinging service is definitely convenient,
and even produces some of its output in perl for use by perl programs.
However, it's important to be really careful when depending on information like this, e.g. when building it into programs, because otherwise it's
easy to trick them into using bogus data, such as the crudely forged
article sent to Cypherpunks earlier today.  The natural implementation is
to pick the more reliable remailers based on "Raph"'s statistics,
so adding records for very reliable bogus remailers is a win.
The security would be improved if Raph signed the weekly file,
but that also requires people using the file to check it with PGP
and not just grep out the relevant lines for their programs' use.

@_subject: Re: What's really in PGP 5.5? 
Eric Hughes brought up this at a cypherpunks meeting earlier this year.
It doesn't mean that businesses often _need_ data recovery, and there are serious and complex concerns about that companies, their legal staffs often deal with.
In particular, the Intellectual Property Bureaucrats tend to get
very concerned if you either do or don't have a large collection of data
in one place, as lawsuit targets, conflict of interest between departments,
and "simultaneous employment" opportunities for clerks and computer-janitors.
But it's clearly the case that they don't need keys, only maybe data.
I haven't yet seen a technical description of PGP5.5, but it sounds like
it's implementing copying data to some corporate data-escrow key.
Note that, while it is a lawsuit/subpoena/warrant target,
that's typically not something that happens without company knowledge,
unlike Louis Freeh's dream of no-knock backdoors for your data.
So who gets the data?  How do you tell what kinds go to whom?
Any corporate feature for implementing this needs to provide some
mechanism and interface for supporting multiple alternative recipients -
if you need message escrow, you may need the 90-day-Work-In-Progress escrow,
or the Long-Term-Projects escrow, or the Company-X-Relationship escrow, or the Accounting-Department Escrow, or the Retain-for-Legal-Department escrow - note that these are different functions from just copying those recipients,
because an escrow feature is supposed to be semi-automatic and not for
automatic and convenient access.  Doing the job right really means you need to be able to send mail to recipients who get only a secret-shared slice of the session key, not the whole thing - not only for corporate data escrow, but also for
mail you've addressed yourself that goes to your lawyers, or the
managers of your trust, or the three trustees of your corporation.
One way to help this problem is to support secret-sharing for user key backup,
as well as the ability to make copies of keys with different passphrases
(e.g. the floppy in the offsite-storage with the passphrase on the yellow-sticky
doesn't use the same passphrase as the same key on your desk machine.)
This is an important point - if you've got [data  + session key] escrow,
you've got a reasonable court case that says the court doesn't need your master keys, just the keys for the specific messages.  Of course,
they _can_ ask to see _all_ the messages by the targeted senders,
just as they can ask to see all the paper in your file cabinets,
but you at least have some ability to fight it.
The issue of whether this is in fact needed or if it's giving in to
the Great Satan is of course the critical one....
No, No, Br'er Zimmermann, Don't throw me in that there briar patch!

it's tougher to automate this stuff.  Does the phone have some way

If there's a failure, you're going to burn this list anyway;
if Alice and Bob each read all their codewords, Mallory can trick them
about 1/16**6 times (1/16Million), which is pretty low -
Mallory learns up to six codewords, but they're only useful if
he doesn't get caught or if Alice and Bob decide to reuse the list
because they don't have a chance to exchange more email.
So if you're not worried about denial of service, catch him.
You do have to make sure Alice and Bob _notice_ they've been hosed;
you can get a bit fancier by using two lists, one for use in case of errors or other interruptions
Alice: Swordsman Swordsman Marxist  ->
Mallory: Marxist COUGH COUGH ->
Alice: Swordsman Swordsman Marxist, sounds like you have a cold? ->
Mallory: Marxist Dilbert Aardvark, and I've got a cold too. ->

@_author: Plus deadbeef attacks make even those suspect. 
@_subject: Re: proposal: commercial data recovery 
At 02:34 AM 10/15/1997 -0700, Will Price, probably annoyed at the
flaming that PGP5.5 has received, flames out Adam Back's proposal
for not doing the right things for his perceived market.
But PGP5.5 doesn't do most of those same things either.
As Ian and Ian have pointed out, this is bogus - the sender can't control the recipients' uses of the message.
At most the sender has a right to control who receives the
message _until_ the recipient gets it,
and if they don't trust the recipient, they shouldn't send it.
This is fine.
PGP 5.5 does not provide this; the message headers only provide KeyID
for each recipient, not the person using the keys, so the recipient
only knows those recipients whose KeyIDs he knows or can look up.
(Plus deadbeef attacks make even those suspect.)
Again, this is bogus - if the recipient's computer is insecure,
then the data is insecure from the moment the recipient decrypts it,
a step that even PGP5.5 does not usually prevent :-)
Bogus.  If you send critical data to a colleague entirely in the clear,
and sendmail eats it instead if delivering it to your colleague,
or the colleague's mailbox disk drive crashes before he reads it,
and you have wiped the only copy before confirming receipt of the message, you lose and PGP5.5 won't help any, since neither PGP5.5 nor the
PGP SMTP filters cause extra copies to be created.
If you do this sort of thing often, you need a new definition of critical.
What you need is automated message receipts, and the decryption system needs to offer your recipient a user-friendly way to send receipts
when he actually reads the message.  PGP5.5 doesn't do this (not its job - it's an encryption program, not a mail user agent) and the mail client's receipts aren't enough, since they don't know if your recipient could decrypt the message successfully  (nor whether they could read the language it was written in,
nor whether the contents made any sense, nor whether the recipient agreed with the content of the message. :-)
If you can't tell serious concerns from spite, your ego's in the way
(you've probably been reading too many negative reviews lately. :-)
There are serious problems with the PGP5.5 approach, even though it does solve real business problems that some of your real customers have,
or at least think they have.
Only the choice of keys is under the sender's control, not the knowledge of what actual _people_ hold those keys or what the CMRKers will do with the data, or even whether they have received copies unless she mails copies them directly
In the PGP SMTP filter context, if the sender must include
certain keys to get the message delivered, that's a rather limited definition of "under the sender's control".
As above, the recipients don't know each other unless
they happen to have each others' KeyIDs on their keyservers,
and since PGP5.5 "elegantly" doesn't indicate whether a recipient
is there because the sender wanted them or whether they're CMRKers.
Sure, if there's only one real recipient, both sender and recipient
know the eavesdroppers, but if there's more than one real recipient,
there's no way to tell.
If you count 5.0 message format as "old" :-)  And while the
CMRK fields apparently were in 5.0 key record formats, they weren't used,
and the semantics are much different even if the syntax is the same.
Treating desired recipients and undesirable recipients the same
is one approach, but it doesn't accomodate people who want
secret sharing to prevent a single CMRker from recovering the message.
I'm not flaming Adam's proposal here; that's a job for another message :-)
In particular, it seems to be evolving, and I haven't figured it out yet,
nor am I convinced there is a way to adequately perform the purposes
of data recovery.

@_subject: Re: Encyrption Program 
There are lots of kinds of random number generators.
Many of them are good for simulations and totally useless for crypto,
and not even very good for the intermediate problem of gambling.
It's worth getting a copy of PGP and reading the section in the
user documentation about Snake Oil - Phil Zimmermann describes
how he invented a cool new cryptosystem using PRNGs and was surprised
to find breaking it as a textbook exercise.  He's gotten better since then :-)
By far the most commonly used is the Linear Congruential Generator;
They're popular because they're fast, simple, and for well-chosen
values of a, c, and m, they produce reasonable-quality random numbers.
Another very popular class of random number generators is Linear Feedback Shift Registers, which look roughly like
where the a[] and b[] variables are bits and it's all modulo 2.
The definitions of "random" used here imply that the
value of x[n] is statistically well-distributed even if you know
That doesn't mean that _you_ can't easily calculate them,
nor does it mean that you can't easily calculate For both LCG and LFSR, there's a lot of mathematical theory
about how to do this, and especially LCGs are pretty useless.
Among other things, if anybody knows the first N bits of your message,
for instance they know some plaintext -- knowing the first two characters is enough for a known LCG using 16-bit integers,
such as the "Fr" in "From: alice or the magic number in the first 2-4 bytes of a file that indicates
it's a GIF or EXE or a.out or whatever.  If you don't know
which 16-bit LCG it is, having the first 4 bytes helps a lot.
And if you don't know, there are only 65536 possibilities,
so just try them all and look for text.  Even if you're
using 32-bit LCG random numbers, that's not very many for a
Pentium to crunch on over the weekend.
You're probably generating the set of random characters from the LCG,
which means if you know one, you know them all (or at least,
if you try it 65536 times you do, for a 16-bit LCG.
This _is_ more annoying for 32-bit LCGs, but not particularly
harder; maybe you need a lab-full of Pentia.)
Similarly, your "random" cube and "random" location are
probably chosen from the same stream.  So for each starting value,
we know the contents of the cubes, and which cube and byte are chosen, so we XOR them with "F", and if that works XOR them with "r",
and work our way down the line.
Providing source is important - thanks; at least there's some chance that
people can look at your algorithm and see if it's been done before.
A good description of what the algorithm is and why it's strong
are also helpful, especially for people who don't know the
syntax of whichever programming language you're using very well.
Only connect once every hundred years?  No thanks!  :-)
Also, is there any way to jump ahead in the LCG?  Is it easy to extend this to x2, x4, x8, x16, x32 ....?
This would make it much faster to calculate the "random" cube and cell,
and would let you only calculate the values you need in the cube
instead of calculating them all, so you only do about log(16*cubevolume) calculations instead of 16*cubevolume.
If that doesn't work, it still gives you a set of values which lets you calculate the coefficients for the cube _once_
(the same amount of work you needed to do to use the encryption),
and then for each value of x[0], calculate x[RandomCubeNumber]
and x[RandomCellNumber], then calculate the value of that
cell in that cube (which takes another lookup+multiply+add+mod).
That means you need to do a dozen or so operations per key,
so even if you're using the 32-bit LCG, that's about 50 billion ops,
which is a thousand or so Pentium-seconds.  If you're using the

However, they are incorrect :-)  The primary failure mode is
"someone official decides to rip off somebody's information".
A single point of failure means there's one big temptation target
where every official can rip off everybody's information -
but in this case that failure will not be repaired:
- it won't be reported most of the time, and - the cost of redesigning the system will be so large
- the least-bad "fix" for the problem will be to add
- the failure will be blamed on the Four Horseman, not the system
- the probable "cure" will be to appoint a Data Privacy Ombudsczar,
Multiple small points of failure mean that it's less likely
that the official who wants to rip off information has access
to the set of information he wants to rip off.  You could argue
that there would be more officials with access, but probably not,
since a big pile of information is something that attracts officials
far faster than little boring piles.

@_subject: Re: what can we do about PGP sell out and CMR? 
They've got customers who wanted it; there's some room for making
it less controllable within their current framework (e.g. making
the behaviour for (as-yet unused) multiple CMRKs to be session-key-splitting rather than one-copy-per-CMRK, which is
be the more obvious implementation and is far more GAK-friendly.)
Also, the SMTP filter stuff won't go away - even if PGP Inc
dropped the product and dropped the CMRK from PGP 5.5.1 and
all future versions, once there's an API for PGP,
it's a piece of cake to write one; you just don't get the visibility that some keys are CMRKers, and you've got the inconvenience of sending more bouncegrams to senders telling them "to send a copy of PGP-encrypted mail to Bob,
you need to also encrypt it to Eve The PostMistress" or, less honestly, "... to the Exchange Gateway".
And at least the PGP SMTP filter only checks for the KeyID and
doesn't actually try to deccrypt the message.
I thought Tim's point was directed to OpenPGP; Jon Callas and others
said things like ~~If you've got features you want done, propose it to OpenPGP and get them to adopt it, and that'll
give us a business reason that we ought to adopt it.~~
(I think the context of that was discussing Stealth, which they
still don't have enough business demand for to take time on,
and which by the way puts a major crimp in SMTP filters.)
That wasn't an exact quote, just a paraphrase from my memory of several conversations.  Even if they did that, it wouldn't change the power relationships;
if the government can compel GAK keys by filtering SMTP or
confiscating non-eavesdropping-compatible mail gateways,
it doesn't matter if the Cc: Big Brother was added as a PGP5.5 CMRK
or as a PGP2.6.2i multiple recipient - you can't tell from
the message format (except for DH vs. RSA).
Unless I misunderstood the formats, CMRKs are just identified by KeyID, not by fingerprint,
and it's easy to look through the public keyservers to find CMRKs
(though companies may prefer to have their employees mail out
keys to people who need them rather than making all their
keys constantly visible on the outside servers.)
So go find them all, send protest email to the postmasters
and corporate officials at the companies that use CMRKs,
crank up your deadbeef generator to make your own keys
with the same KeyIDs as the CMRKs, and pre-load the public keyservers.
A nice touch would be to burn your copies of the private keys
for the CMRK imitators, but we'll never know if you did, will we?

DH between mail clients and servers is a really fine idea if you're

crime, corruption, and villainy that nobody in their right mind
really wants to mess with it.  You could implement it as a sendmail

to adopt it widely once you'd done it; I suppose if you could talk
Netscape and Eudora into adding DH exchange to their client code

It'd still have some major traffic analysis issues,

you need a key distribution infrastructure, which is much harder.
An alternative approach is to encrypt everything using IPSEC,
and you don't have to mess with Sendmail, but there are
performance issues, and there's a lot of work getting it deployed also.

I'll duck the 5.5 argument for now, but you're incorrect on 5.0.  The PGP 5.0 key format includes
separate keys for signature and privacy, which is a mostly good thing,
and includes the ability to associate a group of
keyIDs and flag bits with each privacy key.
What semantics are attached to this association are dependent
on the computer program, and PGP 5.0 does nothing CMRish with them,
much less GAKish.  OpenPGP could do anything it wants with the field,
such as use it for keyids (or IPv4 addresses, since it's 32 bits)
of keyservers with copies of the keys, or whatever.
PGP 5.6 could at least take the case of multiple keyids
and secret-share the session key between them rather than
allowing any single key to access it.
Good - we'll attempt to nitpick it at least as thoroughly as
we're nitpicking PGP 5.5 :-)
No.  This is evil.  Don't go there.  Even with secret sharing,
and especially without.
This is secutity by obscurity; not highly useful.
Objection 3 - users _do_ back up disks -
that means every backup tape or disk or server volume
potentially contains your disk's encryption keys
CAKked up with the Corporate Master Key, which is Bad,

It's very good, but it does have its own risks.
If you use the same keys for signature and encrypting to you,
and the government wants to GAK your encryption keys,
they have to steal your signature keys also, which just about everybody agrees is Bad, and it's
simply unacceptable in a business environment.
On the other hand, if the keys are separate, Louis Freeh
can tell the Congress that it's not a big problem,
he'd NEVER dream of GAKing your signature keys,
he only wants emergency access to your privacy keys --
this may give the GAK folks a better chance of getting it.
Similarly, your corporate security bureaucrats can understand
the concept that if they CAK your privacy keys,
they're risking having official company signatures get forged,
and they'll often do the right thing and desist,
but with separate keys that won't stop them.
No.  As far as I know (without reading 7000 pages of code :-),
pgp5.0 won't construct CMR key fields, and won't use them,
it just isn't supposed to die if it receives a key containing them.
If it receives a key containing CMRKs, it doesn't choke on the CMRKs,
and when you encrypt a message to the key, it ignores the CMRKs.
If it receives a message encrypted to both real people and CMRKers,
there's no way to tell which are which (though if you don't have
CMRKs in your key, they're obviously not your CMRKs.)
Just you.
First of all, the only reason for having a CMRK attached to your key
is that either your mail service will reject mail to you that doesn't
contain it, or your employer insists on it.  In either case,
it can be done without a special CMRK field on your key --
PGP multiple recipients are enough to do that, and the sender
just has to remember to include the (no longer automagically attached) CMRK.
So leaving out the CMRK doesn't protect you.
Second, if the government is coming to get your disk anyway,
they can get themselves a court order to have you reveal the key,
and you can argue with the judge about whether you should be
compelled to reveal it, and at least in the US there's a Fifth Amendment backing up your arguments (though like the
other amendments, it's weakened by the "except for drugs" clause...)
GAK asserts that the government has the right to your keys
before you get to court.  Corporate access to storage keys,
on the other hand, is concerned with protecting the company's
information on the company's computers, and you can reasonably
negotiate how much of that you want to live with and comply with.
Some companies want to protect their information in case you
get hit by a bus, or a lawsuit; other companies don't even
have the sense to provide decent automated network-based backup
to protect their information from head crashes.
On yet another hand, while it may be obvious when the
government steals your disk and uses Storage-GAK,
companies using Storage-CAK or Storage-CMR can use it just as well on the backup tapes without your notice
as on your disk drive.  Furthermore, you can think of
the data backup process as communications from you
to the backupmeister, so Storage-CAK _is_ Message-CAK,
and Storage-CMR is Message-CMR.
But CAKing the disk doesn't protect the company's information,
and there's therefore no excuse for using it.  Superencryption
is always possible, in messages as well as files, but with
message encryption the eavesdropping-prone corporation can
detect superencrypted messages going by (though not stego'd),
while PGP-encrypted files on your disk only show up _after_
you've been hit by the bus on your way to the headhunter's.
BTW, PGP5.5 CMR _is_ CMR'd storage encryption.  It's not as convenient as encrypted file systems like PGPdisk and Secdev, but people are using it to encrypt stored data,
including email and non-email files.
On a technical note, GAK for storage can be made less dangerous,
though not less offensive, by adding a layer of indirection -
use your public key to encrypt a symmetric key, store the encrypted
symmetric key on your disk, and then use the symmetric key for
encrypting the storage (or as a master key for encrypting the
per-file or per-block storage keys, if you're doing that, which you probably should.)  This means that a search warrant
which is required to itemize the things it's looking for can be
more effectively restricted to specific files rather than
cracking the whole disk and every other disk that uses the
same encryption keys.
as decentralised as much as possible.  Trust me - you _really_ don't want mailboxes encrypted,
recovery key or no recovery key, unless it's implemented very very well.
Microsoft Mail, and as near as I can tell Microsoft Exchange,
puts the user's entire mailbox, stored message folders and all,
in one big ugly cheaply-encrypted file.  The encryption isn't
strong enough to keep the NSA out, but it's strong enough to keep
you from repairing the file if part of it gets damaged,
and enough to keep you from extracting the undamaged parts,
or accessing it with sorting tools not built into MSMail.
Combined with the Microslush Mail Mindset of never sending text
when a Microsoft Word file could do, and never sending Word
when an even-more-bloated PowerPoint Presentation can fit,
your mailbox easily expands to over 100MB, too big to fit
on a ZIP drive.  Eventually, something always gets corrupted,
and you end up with Corporate Message Non-Recoverability.

Besides doing things at the SMTP, IPSEC, or SSL layers,
another approach is SSH.  You could build an application-specific
relay (e.g. something sitting on your machine receiving SMTP
and something sitting on your mailhost relaying it to sendmail),
but SSH does close enough to that that it may be the way to go,
except for occasional annoyances about who can use Port 25.
Also, there are two mail protocols to address - smtp for sending, but pop3 (or imap4) for mailbox-retrieval.
Using either SSH or IPSEC or something SSL-based
can help you cover the POP3 end as well.
On the other hand, you can also use Hotmail or a Hotmail clone
with SSL and bypass the whole process.  Or you can use a
PGP-equipped remailer.

The easy approach is to decrypt the message, but there's of course
no way for the Court to validate that your decryption was correct.
But if you want more than that, it's not hard to write, either by
finding where in the 7000 pages of PGP source (:-) to add a few
print statements, or by using the APIs when they come out.
Perhaps it's even there today, by setting -debug=42 or whatever.
The decryption needs to show
1) The public key that was used to encrypt the message
2) The PK-encrypted session key, including the random padding
3) The decryption of the PK-encrypted session key, including the random padding,
3.1) Indication of which bits are the session key  itself, for the slow-witted
4) The decrypted compressed plaintext (optional)
5) The decrypted raw plaintext
And it would be nice to have a tool that also provides a mechanism
to encrypt a random-padded session key to a public key to verify the output.  Perhaps Adam Back (et al.)'s 2-line perl code,
with some pretty output formatting.
No way.  This is bad.  You don't want traceability built into PGP.
If the sender _wants_ to be traceable, he can sign the message.
If the sender wants convenient but repudiable identification,
he can put his name and any other information he wants in the plaintext.
Besides, PGP doesn't know who the sender _is_ except by signature;
you can set a default key if you like, but otherwise there's no way
for PGP to decide whether to use the "Bob " key
in Bob's secret key ring, or the "Louis Freeh " key,
and for that matter PGP will work fine with no secret-key file at all.
If you're concerned about Bad Cops planting forged messages on people, this won't help - it's easy for them to forge unsigned information also.
After all, the PGP source code is open, so Bad Cops can add code to
set the timestamp/sender/etc themselves.  Or they can ignore code,
and just set their system clock appropriately.

@_subject: Re: Laws recognizing digital signatures 
Cem Kaner  gave a good presentation on the legal climate surrounding digital signatures at is month's Cypherpunks meeting.  There's a lot of bad legislation being proposed in various UN and US working groups, where "bad" includes "inflexible" and "favoring specific models of what a signature means" and "favoring the certificate authority rather than the merchant or customer
in a transaction using certified signatures" and
"limiting who can be a CA, possibly including licensing".
He's got information available at  and You might also want to talk to Carl Ellison about his views on signatures.
The basic problem is - Person Alice may have a key
- Merchant Bob has an online store
- Customer X presents Bob with a key K, certified by CA Charlie,
- Alice says it wasn't her and refuses to pay Bob the bill.
So who gets stuck with the bill?  Alice?  Bob?  Charlie?
In most commercial transactions, there's a legal tradition that defines
the liability when a signature is misused or a transaction fails badly.  With forged checks or counterfeit Federal Reserve notes, the merchant loses.
With checks written against insufficient funds, Alice is liable,
though if she doesn't have any money to collect, the merchant still loses.
With credit cards in the US, the credit card company is liable to the merchant,
whether the credit card was stolen or Alice doesn't pay; in case of theft
Alice is liable to the credit card company for $50, but it's not Bob's problem.
This is a benefit to the merchant, since he can almost always accept a payment
and make a sale, and it's a benefit to the consumer, because the merchant
will accept her payment so she can get her stuff, and it's a big pain to the
credit card companies, who lose a lot of money to fraud every year, though
of course their fee to the merchant includes that cost, as does the merchant's
price to the consumer which is higher to cover the credit card fees.
In most of the new digital signature legislation, it's being pushed by the
Certificate Authority companies, who want to make sure they're not liable,
and who generally want to stick the consumer Alice with the bill,
since it's her fault if she let her public key get misused.
Not only is consumer getting the short end of the stick on these laws,
which is Cem's interest in this topic, but so is the merchant,
because if Alice is liable, he's got to collect from her if he can;
Cem is surprised that the Sears Roebuck and similar large merchant types
haven't been actively participating in these meetings.
One is "what does a signature mean, and how do we represent it",
which sidetracked much of the discussion during Cem's talk.
Another is that there's a preference toward a hierarchical model of CAs,
rather than the everybody's-a-CA web-of-trust model used by PGP;
in particular, regulations on digital signatures often require CAs
to meet some set of licensing requirements, which would mean you couldn't
sign anybody's key without a license, or at least without acquiring some
liability for how they used it.  (Then of course, once CAs are licensed and
findable, they're a regulatory target - even if you can't force them to
escrow their users' keys, you can at least use them for traffic analysis,
especially if you're using certificate revocation lists.)
An entertaining problem Cem also brought up is that if he doesn't
get his keys signed by anyone, they're just keys, and mean whatever
he agrees contractually with his clients that they mean.
On the other hand, if he gets his keys signed by someone,
there's some definition of liability that may obtain from that action,
not only based on the contracts he makes with the CA, but potentially
on any regulations on CAs and digital signatures that get adopted.

My usual rant on cryptography and privacy goes like this:
- How may of you like to fill out forms with your Social Security Number?
It's so convenient, having one little number that ties in everything,
from your taxes to your bank accounts to your credit reports to your
cellphone to your credit cards to all the jobs you've worked to
the $25 lunch you had yesterday and the books you bought at Borders
to the people you live with to the gasoline your roommate Bob bought for your car Friday night?   Me neither.   Computers are really good at tying information together -
take one thing you know, and they can connect it to other things they know -
and they're getting so ridiculously cheap that the only reason they
_don't_ tie two things together is that nobody's figured out how to
make money off of that combination yet.  We know that after Bob bought gas,
he had a couple of drinks at a bar where many of the other patrons use the same credit cards at gay bookstores, but we just haven't decided yet
whether to send _you_ some discount coupons for the same bookstores,
or to suggest that your girlfriend Alice get an AIDS test before we'll
give her medical insurance at her new job.  After all, we're already testing her
cholesterol level because of all the pork you've been buying at Safeway.
So what can we do about it?  Computers keep getting cheaper and faster every year, and that won't stop.  Laws don't help much.
Some European governments try data privacy laws, but they're mainly an excuse to inspect _your_ computer for illicit data -
the same governments already require you to join the National Health Care
and carry a National ID card in many of them, and pay income tax,
and there's that nice new EC driver's license instead of the old one from each country.  The US makes some noise about that,
but it's the same government that's making you give your SSN and
thumbprint to get a driver's license and registering all kids with the IRS.
If you can't stop people from combining information, the alternative
is don't give it to them - use cash, but more importantly build computer
systems that let businesses solve their business problems without
universal identifiers.  Use employee ID numbers on forms instead of SSNs
(and in a global business environment, it's pretty dumb to do otherwise.)
Use cryptographic techniques, like digital cash, to let people buy things
on the web without sending your credit card numbers.  There's some cool
work by David Chaum on creating credentials, like driver's licenses that keep track of your tickets but don't use ID numbers, and voter registration
that indicates your voting district and status but aren't tied to the census
that says three of your neighbors are black with Haitian parents.
You can give everybody a stack of taxpayer-ids, whether
on paper or on a smartcard, any bank or employer that needs to collect
taxes on you has a number to use, but only the IRS can tie them together,

Chaum's digicash system was designed for automated road tolls, so you can
drive through the tollbooth without slowing down, and the toll system takes
the money off your smartcard, without telling Big Brother where _you_ were.
Here in California, we can send a monthly bill to the address on your license,

We're more worried about the automatic traffic fines, when your car didn't take

the exit by that bar Bob went to.  Next door to the synagogue bookstore.
There's an alternative to crypto - it's "give up privacy".  Go the David Brin route, and make sure that if the police have
video cameras everywhere pointed at you, you and your neighbors
have video cameras everywhere pointed at them.  Ask Rodney King
if that matters - or ask the next cop who wants to beat up the next driver.
Cameras keep getting cheaper and smaller, and networks to tie them
together and computers to interpret the pictures are getting faster.
And the police do have cameras - last year, when San Francisco was planning
to close the Central Freeway for repairs, they video taped all the cars for a few days, looked up the license plate numbers, and mailed the drivers
postcards asking them to take a different road when construction started.
It worked real well, especially because they didn't need 100% coverage.
They used cheap labor to read the license plates off the video tapes,
but computers can do it in real time if you need to do it often,
and they can match the SSN on your car registration with the SSN
on your tax forms from work, so they _could_ send you a nice postcard
suggesting the best router to get to _your_ office.  And a coupon for the Starbucks drivethrough on the way.  So Have A _Nice_ Day!
One of my favorite programming languages is Algol.
It's designed for describing mathematical problems very precisely
for humans, and it was the standard language used by the
"Communications of the ACM" journal for many years.
It's not designed for telling computers what to do,
though there is computer software that will read Algol
and do it.  But if an American math teacher writes a couple  lines of mathematics in Algol and emails them to a non-American student,
he'd better be a registered international arms dealer,
or he can be busted....

Sure.  The securities industry is especially concerned about the problem,
since there are many combinations of people who can rip of the others;
there's enough money floating around fast enough that anybody even
marginally dishonest can make lots of money quickly,
just as they can make money by arbitraging other market inefficiencies.
- broker and customer conspire to rip off the house
- broker and house conspire to rip off customer
- broker and insider conspire to rip off insider's company
- broker and insiders conspire to rip off outsiders
- broker leaves for another house, taking customers
- broker, customer, and house conspire to avoid taxes
- broker and customer conspire to otherwise hide money
- broker and customer conspire to transfer money to another customer
- broker and house conspire to deceive auditors
Some of these get controlled by the house to preserve its money;
some get controlled by regulators trying to "help" consumers,
some get controlled by the house because too many disgruntled customers
cuts into your reputation capital.  (Insider trading is especially like this.)
For the most part, this gets handled by extensive recordkeeping and auditing,
and the value of CAK/CMR is diluted here because it's mostly providing
access to information that was already being provided anyway.
You're better off using the PGP SMTP filters to _require_ encryption....

Not true - you can't implement CMR without a mail enforcer unless
you can stop your employees from using non-CMR versions of PGP,
which is nearly impossible.  Even with an enforcer, of course,
you can't stop the determined employee from double-encrypting and
steganizing and otherwise getting their outbound bits past your enforcer
looking like the baseball game narrative from Wayner's Mimic Functions
or Pointy-Haired-Boss randomness, but they could also carry a floppy disk out the door or beam infrared out the window from their Newton.
Similarly, on incoming mail, you can't stop people from sending your
employees non-CMRed mail without an inbound-mail enforcer and
can't stop your employees from reading it with their own warez.
More importantly, though, PGP isn't a mail program, it's an encryptor,
and if you're trying to stop people from sending encrypted mail
back and forth, you've got to control the mail system as well as the
encryptors, and you probably already _do_ control the mail system.

As Robert and Tim point out, the important issue is that
you can tell that a posting claiming to be from "Amad3us"
is or is not by the same set of authors as the previous
articles by the pseudonym "Amad3us".  This allows authors
to create and defend "reputation capital", and allows readers
to use the pseudonym to help evaluate their postings
and read them in the context of the previous postings by that nym,
regardless of which human body (or bodies) and True Name/s may
be attached to the author.
Without the signatures, the posting may be by an imposter
trying to take advantage of the positive reputation of a nym,
or trying to discredit the nym's reputation by bad postings,
or just having a Good Time with a hoax.  Most of the pseudonymous
posters on Cypherpunks, and for that matter many of the
Probably True Name posters, don't sign most of their postings,
and we don't have a lot of forgeries, but every once in a while
somebody will do a lot of forgery, or will target an individual,
and you can know that any _signed_ posting is from someone
who holds the keys used to sign previous postings with those keys.
In the Name=Key=Body model of the world, somebody can get
other people to verify their identity and sign for it;
if you're a pseudonym, your only choices are to reveal and demonstrate your identity to someone who can sign your keys,
or to just publish the keys early on and use them as needed.
In particular, if you publish the key with your first posting,
then you can demonstrate later that you're the poster who
used that name.  Thus, Checkered Daemon announced his nym with
a key, and since I could find no other record of use of that name,
I was willing to sign that key 0x50EC521D as his (I do use
a separate key for signing nyms; I've signed them for a few other
people such as Black Unicorn, some of whom I've since met in person.)
You can also get similar results by posting your key fingerprint
in your messages and sending the key to a keyserver, and it's
a bit more compact, but for a first posting using a nym
it's worthwhile to include the key.
In Amad3us's case, I've only seen the posting referring to his original,
and not the original itself, and it was garbled enough that
I couldn't add the key to my keyring.

I found this very annoying a couple months ago when I was rebuilding my

I was using RAM disks on my 386 machines with Win3.1.
Now that I've got faster machines with more RAM,
I'm running Win95 and can't find a ramdisk program - does anybody know where to find one?
On Unix, you _could_ do things with temp files,
but it usually made much more sense to structure your programs
to use pipes, which means there's no temp file and only
a few KB of RAM buffering in between each program.
PGP's DOS heritage doesn't encourage this sort of programming,
though the new design for one-pass processing may have
made it either possible or unnecessary.
On machines with real operating systems, designing a ramdisk includes deciding whether to make it virtual memory
that might get swapped if necessary, or nail it into RAM.
Since RAMdisks are usually intended for increasing speed,
it usually makes more sense to let the vm manager decide
what pages to page out and what pages not to,
but obviously if you're using it for security that's different.
SunOS had the /tmpfs file system design which let you
get hybrid behavior - temp files stay in RAM until
they need to get swapped out to disk, and most programs
delete them before that ever happens - really speeds up compiles.
your files would end up on disk, but they'd usually be safe.

[I'm also posting this to coderpunks, but cypherpunks is probably a better place for discussions.]
I'm pleased to see PGP Inc. permitting development of freeware,
but at leased from a first reading of the license, it's a _really_ restrictive definition of "freeware" - not only does the software have to be free, but it can only be used in extremely restrictively non-commercial activities.
It's far more restrictive than RSAREF (though more precisely defined.)
Here's an excerpt from the web page at
First of all, it sounds like it can only be used by students at
non-government-run universities, but not at Berkeley, and if
Random MIT Student develops PGPwidget using the toolkit,
students at U.C.Berkeley can't use it for academic use either,
except perhaps on their PCs at home (if they live off-campus.)
(Do any of the UK universities count as non-government-run?)
But "within a commercial business or facility" is far more restrictive.  I use a laptop for my home and work email, and carry it around.
It sounds like I can't use PGPwidget or PGPsdk for encrypting personal email at lunchtime when my laptop is at the office,
and perhaps not from a hotel (at least if I'm there on business)?
I probably can't start PGPwidget at home and leave it running
when I carry the laptop to work.  I probably can't use PGPwidget
when I'm reading my work email at home, though perhaps it's ok
to use it on personal mail that someone sent to my work MSExchange,
assuming it's not a widget that competes with a PGP product.
This is frustrating - today, I can use PGP 2.6.2, and maybe 5.0,
at work, though I can't sell it without a license, and it's
not very clear whether I can run a commercial service without
a license (I probably need a license from RSA, but not PGP,
and non-RSA keys probably don't require that.)  And I can certainly
write programs that use PGP command-line interfaces to encrypt things without any restrictions on my code.

In addition to selling crypto, their web page says they also sell an
"Automates the process of submitting your URL's to over 370 sites!"

Their web page doesn't look like snake oil, though they _really_ need to emphasize the importance of good keys (they talk about DES having been cracked once by the distributed internet crack, and neglect to mention that DES with easy-to-guess keys has been cracked regularly for years.  So not only do the Bad Guys abuse the level of effort of the crack, but so do well-meaning but clueless people.) I'd guess they don't do anything like generating a random high-entropy session key and encrypting it with a passphrase.
Also, they promise an "Update to 448-Bit encryption", which says
that even if there's no snake oil now, there may be soon.
Upgrade so you can email your encrypted files right through Cryptx. You

@_subject: Re: trusting untrusted platforms 
In general, you can't.  Many interesting problems are NP,
so you can quickly tell from the output whether it matches the input,
but many more interesting problems are not, especially in crypto.
Often there's a special form that lets you detect
false positives, but for false negatives you're usually out of luck.
And for complex calculations other than searches, such as numerical stuff, you usually lose too.
The common solution, which also covers "this machine started looking
but stopped and didn't tell me", is to assign problem space
to multiple users (and hope they don't collude :-).
Random search is surprisingly effective, and has the
advantage that it doesn't require coordination.
It's sometimes helpful to structure the searches a bit
so you can easily compare results from multiple players.

Forwarded from IETF-Announce and ietf-open-pgp
A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the An Open Specification for Pretty Good Privacy Working Group of the IETF.
This document is maintained in order to publish all necessary
information needed to develop interoperable applications based on the
OP format.  It is not a step-by-step cookbook for writing an
application, it describes only the format and methods needed to read,
check, generate and write conforming packets crossing any network.  It
does not deal with storing and implementation questions albeit it is
necessary to avoid security flaws.
OP (Open-PGP) software uses a combination of strong public-key and
conventional cryptography to provide security services for electronic
communications and data storage.  These services include
confidentiality, key management, authentication and digital signatures.
This document specifies the message formats used in OP.

As computer programs for analyzing and generating natural language improve,
there's a lot that can be automated, though stylometry does give away which
rewriters you commonly use, the way typewriter differences used to generate clues.
There are crude examples today, like Jive and Valspeak,
and you probably wouldn't want to use a Zippyfier on your ecommerce
Also, I'm sure there will be freelance writing coaches out there on the net,
who make a business of editing, and who'll be happy to take your
grody Valley-Accent writing and help you write proper formal business jargon,
and if you're giving them the already robo-rewritten text, that's pretty secure.
Also, formal grammars, such as EDI, often constrain the expressiveness of commercial communications, reducing the need for obfuscation.

That may not be what they _intended_, but it's what they said..  They're very explicit that using "within a commercial business or facility"  is commercial, and they're including government agencies and organizations.
That means if you're using it in a government-owned building,
it's commercial from their license's standpoint.
If they hadn't explicitly said "facility", that might be a reasonable
interpretation, but they've provided carefully crafted language that's pinning down a very broad definition of commercial.
If they want to go that direction, well, it's their code (mostly.)
But it's a much different direction from the previous policies.

Besides the risks of using proxy.evil.nsa.mil or proxy.blacknet.net,
there are other subtle things that a proxy server could do.
For instance, replacing banner ads is easy - you can't recognize them all,
but ad.doubleclick.net and linkexchange.com are easy targets;
an anonymizing proxy might replace those ads with its own,
or at least with static images that load faster.
This has a lot of implications when using the proxy to access
advertising-supported web sites, and there have been lawsuits over
web services that provided access to other web-based news services
while adding their own advertising banners in another frame
(one such target was totalnews.com.)
Of course, if you want to make advertising banners go away,
you can start by aliasing ad.doubleclick.net to 127.0.0.2 or whatever;
I've found it loads much faster this way :-)

The Anonymizer has blocking capability to take care of web pages

the Anonymizer automatically blocks sites that are getting pounded on,
but it can at least stop the problem after it gets noticed.
The Terms Of Service are at  ;
"Abusers of the Anonymizer can expect no anonymity."
Of course, the Anonymizer maintains minimal information about its users,
so it's not clear whether you'll just lose your $15 account or get hunted down by dogs.
Of course, if the Anonymizer is using caching, nobody'll know to whine,
except for pages which are designed to subvert the dominant paradigm
by being uncacheable and different every time, and they deserve
Darwin's attention anyway.
Free anonymizer users aren't much risk, with 30 second delays,
assuming the anonymizer still places some limits on how many total
page hits per second or kbps it'll do for free.
Paid anonymizer users probably have more potential to cause damage,
since they're not time-limited, and using automated systems for
high-speed requests is against terms of service.

He's called for a far more dangerous method of getting rid of it

News and email are two separate cases.  For news, there's almost no reason
for a poster who wants his real name and address in a message to use
an anonymous remailer; maybe something like posting with your Juno email
on the message rather than your work email.  But you can put your
real email address in the message body if you want to do that,
so not having that feature in a remailer is no restriction on the legitimate user.  There are lots of reasons to forge someone else's name :-)
So if the remailers don't support From: pasting, it's no loss.
Similarly, for Reply-To: and Sender: and Path: and Received:
and maybe a few other occasionally-forged header fields.
Adding a disclaimer to the beginning of the message is no problem;
adding it to the headers is useless, since almost nobody reads them,
especially the kind of shoot-from-the-hip flamers you want to avoid.
For email, perhaps you don't want the address to be visible during
the first few hops in an encrypted remailer path, but you do still want one of your addresses to be there for the recipient.
Again, you can put it in the message body yourself.
There's a little less risk of pasting in headers on mail to individuals,
but forged mail to mailing lists and mail2news relays is still a problem,
and you definitely can't expect remailers to recognize mailing lists.
There are also minor problems, like forging the From: address on mail
to president which are better avoided this way
even if you do also add disclaimers.

These are easy enough; the address-munging gets rid of these and
also things like forgings to alt.test and other bots,
though eventually the spammers may catch on to "User  Foo  com" etc.
The hard problem is
I shut down my remailer a few years ago because of this one;
the forger posted hate mail to the gay newsgroups with the victim's name
at the bottom (didn't even use From: pasting, just message body.)
Supporting From: pasting just encourages this.
It's possible to cancel the one forged usenet message,
but that didn't stop the flames many people emailed to her,
and fewer systems are accepting cancels these days,
especially when forged by remailers...
Besides Usenet, other popular tactics for retribution are
sending death threats to politicians, sending child pornography
to mailing lists, forging messages _from_ politicians, etc.
Disclaimer/warning headers help, but can't stop it all.
This was before Gary Burnore's attacks on the remailer networks,
but it's also an obvious tactic for either flamers or Feds to use
for getting remailers shut down.  If somebody forges a Usenet posting
with telnet, it's not _your_ problem (usually).  If they use your remailer,
it is your problem.  And if they get remailers closed down a lot,
it's all of our problems.
It's worth also repeating it at the bottom.  Putting it in the headers
is invisible with most newsreaders, though.
By the way, one technical risk with From:-pasting is that you need to
parse or substitute special characters including parens and anglebrackets.
Otherwise it's easy for people to paste in syntactically incorrect headers,
which really annoy some gateways and mail clients - nested parens are
a particular problem.
Basically, I think you're getting yourself in for excitement
and adventure and really wild stuff by supporting this :-)

Actually, setting the reply to point to your nymserver address
is the one legitimate use I can see for it, though that
capability probably should be provided by the nymserver.
The reason for chaining through remailers is to gain anonymity.
But you don't need a special anonymity server to do that;
a keyserver plus either a personna certificate or some archiving mechanism is enough.
The certificate shows that you're the first+only person at that
certificate issuer to use the name you've chosen; the archive
shows that the first poster using the name  used PGP Key .
I have a PGP key I use for signing pseudonyms which performs
the personna certificate function - I'll verify uniqueness
of keys that I've signed.  The PGP signature key is enough to do that, and without the digital signature there's no way to prevent forgery.
(I've got mixed feelings about whether to sign a key for a name who has a known history without having the key attached.  I've signed Black Unicorn's, but the other nyms I've signed have been for users who announced their key along with their initial use of the nym.)

Pasting those in isn't controversial, and is generally supported;
you could be using Subject: pasting today with most remailers,
using the  syntax.
At minimum, addresses in Cc: and Bcc: need to be checked against
blocking lists, and it's probably worth checking the number of
names in the list against some threshold - especialy Bcc:s,
which tend to be popularly used by spamware.
Too easy to be abused by forgers, as are Reply-To: and Sender:.
MSMail and other closed systems are generally quite arrogant
about only showing you the mail headers they "know" you want to see,
and discarding the rest, whether that's what you want or not.
Lots of mail clients only show you one From:, either discarding others or making them available in a "Show all headers" mode.
Which is a bit annoying, by the way, for cypherpunks who don't
want to read your mail :-)  On the other hand, alt.anonymous.messages
is a fine place for people to send replies, and you can do things like
At one time, there was a message-pool service on the extropia remailer
which forwarded anything retrieved to all its subscribers;
if the list is small it's not much protection, but it's one way

There are other remailer-like systems that provide mailboxes
for anonymous retrieval; I think Jenaer does something like that.

Precisely - it looks like they've probably got a friendly user interface,

a 5-whatevers rating without that quality behind it.
Sounds like it's playing some game using lost chains or equivalent.
No thanks :-)  But it's actually not a bad place to hide stuff,
if you expect amateurs to break into your system.
"As far as we know" means "We haven't applied for export permission",
which means "so we don't have a clue".  If it _did_ have export permission,
that would imply they'd either had some serious discussion with the Feds,
allowing export of a strong product for limited applications/customers,
or else that it was too wimpy for the Feds to care so they said OK.
"Yow!  I'm using rot1313131313 with an 8192-bit key!"
With cryptographically strong algorithms, the key length determines
the amount of work required to crack them.  With weak algorithms,
adding longer and longer keys doesn't help any.
Not a bad goal, for some applications, like communications.
For encrypting disk files, where you'll typically be grabbing
clusters of 512-8192 bytes at a time, it's unnecessary, and
weakening your encryption just to provide it is a big lose.
For some database applications, it may make sense, but generally
the amount of time required to decrypt a block of disk is
faster than the disk's seek time anyway, and I wouldn't trust a
serious database to a system that won't let you run chkdsk
and requires thought before using scandisk and defragmenters.
Many other algorithms actually provide this capability, typically by
using block chaining algorithms like CBC.  Varying the key based on
location in the file reduces the success of dictionary searches,
if done carefully, but if you're using an algorithm that
has a maximum keysize of the blocksize, anybody who figures out
the way you vary the 8-bit key by location can crack it trivially.
Furthermore, you *didn't* say that the key really was more than
8 bits...
Patenting requires revealing the algorithm, losing any supposed security you had by keeping it secret.  So you might as well reveal it now,
and let professional cryptographers take a look at it.
Patenting an algorithm doesn't mean the Patent Office thinks it's any good;
that's beyond their expertise.  It means they believe you when you say
it's new and unique, but with cryptography, there's a large amount of
prior art that's outside the expertise of a typical patent examiner.
Being obscure doesn't help - anybody who's trying to guess the password
already knows the victim is using your program, and can disassemble it.
Anybody who's trying to crack somebody's disk drive without their permission
isn't going to be bothered by violating your clickwrap license,
especially if they're police engaged in legitimate crime fighting
or illegitimate warrantless searches.
Doesn't help someone whose disk is already encrypted with your product.
That's not dependent on the algorithm, it's dependent on the interface
used to get the material off the disk.  Some encryption systems
encrypt the whole file on opening, or at system boot,
while others are file system or disk drivers that
encrypt/decrypt a block at a time and never leave the material unencrypted
on disk.  Surely you'd know that if you wrote such a program yourself.
If you don't use a standard algorithm, you need to publish the one you use
so people will know if it's any good.  There are a few people who can get
away without doing this, based on their reputation in the field,
but _you're_ not Ron Rivest, and even _he_ got much flak from the community
for keeping RC2 and RC4 trade secret for a while.  If you had the academic credentials to get away with it, you'd also know not to make
statements like the ones you make about export and obscurity.
So do the right thing - use algorithms that there's a good reason
to trust, and do the user interface stuff you do well.

Neither has Spamford.  I'm usually willing to read your words, but not his.
Hashcash-mail is a tool for users to use to automate limiting the email they receive to mail sent out by real individuals who actually want to communicate with them, throwing away mail from spammers.
Whether it will catch on or not is a social issue.  There are telephone
answering devices that prompt for a password and either hang up on callers
who don't have one, forward them to the answering machine, or just
give them a low-priority ring.  I don't use one, and nobody I know
currently does, because they annoy the callers you care about
more than they annoy telephone spammers, who have lists of thousands of
other people to spam if you're not interested.  On the other ham,
if PacBell offered distinctive ringing like most Bell companies do,
I'd use it - not for splitting types of callers, but for my fax machine...
It would be interesting to find useful problems that could be used instead of hash collisions.  Factoring numbers can be distributed well,
and it's possible to tell quickly that X is a factor of Y, but unfortunately
it's not possible to tell quickly that the user unsuccessfully checked some
range of potential factors rather than just pretending to have done so.
Similarly, if the user finds the key K | C=DES(M,K), you can tell quickly,
but you can't tell if the user checked a range K1..Kn except by
checking it yourself (slowly.)  But maybe there's some useful variant that
can be checked quickly.
Digicash, maybe, though not hashcash, since hashcash is just a timewaster
that's easy to verify and only takes a long time for high-volume users.
As far as routers charging per packet goes, we've had X.25 networks which
charge by the kilopacket for a long time; it's much clumsier and more
to operate than a flat-rate network.  One of the reasons the Internet has overtaken X.25 so dramatically is that flat-rate pricing encourages people to
use and provide free services, increasing the base of customers and the
size of the flat-rate service they buy -- the ISPs also win.
And many web pages _do_ charge for reading them - usually the charge is
the time it takes to download and (read or) discard an advertising banner;
users are generally much more willing to pay that cost than cash,
though there are some services that give you abstracts of articles for free
and charge you money for the full version (either charging per item or charging per month for "premium" service.)
DNS charges are paid for by the domain name holder who wants to be found.
TLDs and SLDs are funded by the domain name registration fees in some places,
and unfortunately by Your Tax Dollars in other places, or by DNS fees
laundered by the government through their subcontractors.
Lower-level domain name service is paid for by the SLD holder or agents.
If you don't want to pay to publish your DNS name on the servers,
you can always call yourself  or whatever,
as many spam sellers do.
