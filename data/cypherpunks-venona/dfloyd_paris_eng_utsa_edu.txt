@_subject: Data haven code 
I am looking for beta testers for the data haven code.
It should be ready by the tenth to the fifteenth of October.
Due to a mishap partly caused my me, the machine that had the code
got hosed and I have to re-create most of the work again :(.
If you are interested in beta-testing this code, please E-mail me
(dfloyd and please encrypt the response with PGP.
(My key is on the keyservers, or fingerable from lonestar.utsa.edu)
Now back to your regularly scheduled programming.

My code smells like that?  I didn't think C code smelled...
2^128 and 2^150+ are big numbers.  I doubt that any collisions
will occur.
Another thing...  I do like Eric's idea for an entropy checker.  Is there
any code like this laying around on some ftp site?  Keep poor VK from
worrying about his account...
