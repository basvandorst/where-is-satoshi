cypherpunks.  It's going in the ftp site, as well--Eric]
Go ahead and forward this to cypherpunks.
This is the short posting I wrote in 1990 when I explained how I got the Steve Jackson Games case into the press.

This is a file I posted to an Austin BBS back when I gave
the SJG story to the local papers.
 104: Talking to Media, part 1
  By: Johnny Mnemonic  [54]
As I've promised on another message base, here's the beginning of
discussion of how to bring stories to the media.
Since I keep thinking of different things people ought to know about how
to take a story to the media, I'm going to make this a multi-post
1) TRY TO THINK LIKE THE REPORTER YOU'RE TALKING TO.
One of the things that happens when people know about an event or series
of events that may make a good news story is that they assume the
importance of the story will be obvious to anyone.
Sometimes this is true (when the tipster knows about a murder, for
example). Often it's not.
So, when I tell a reporter about a story I think she should want to cover,
I make sure to stress the aspects of the story that are likely to interest
that reporter and/or the readers of her publication. For example, when I
spoke to Kyle Pope about the Illuminati seizure, I stressed the following:
a) Steve Jackson Games is an Austin business that may end up being damaged
by the seizure.
b) Nobody has given this story anything like major coverage in the
national media, or (so far as I knew) in other geographic areas. (I was
telling him he had a major "scoop" opportunity.)
c) There are some very dramatic aspects to this story. (I told him about
the 20-year-old LoD member who woke up on the morning of March 1 with a
gun pointed at him by a Secret Service agent.)
2) IF YOU'RE GOING TO MEET THE REPORTER IN PERSON, TRY TO BRING SOMETHING
ON PAPER.
There are lots of good reasons to follow this rule:
a) Believe it or not, but people take stuff on paper a little more
seriously than the spoken word. It's nice to give the reporter something
that lends substance to what you're saying, even if the substance is
printouts from your own computer.
b) It makes life easier for the reporter, who doesn't have to write down
every single thing you tell her. Reporters like to have materials they can
use for reference as they research and write their stories.
c) It helps you remember to say everything you want to say. Nothing is
more frustrating than trying to get a reporter interested in your story,
getting inconclusive results, and then realizing later that you should
have told the reporter about something. (E.g., "Damn! I forgot to tell
him what 'cyberpunk' means, so he won't know how the federal agents
misinterpreted the manual.")
When I went to the Statesman, I took edited printouts of discussions from
Flight, from SMOF, and from comp.dcom.telecom on Usenet. I also took some
private Email I had received, with the names of the senders deleted. And I
took my copy of the WHOLE EARTH REVIEW with the article on Usenet. My
object was to convey to him the scale of concern about the seizures, plus
give him enough background to be able to ask reasonably informed questions
of the people he talked to.
3) GIVE THE REPORTER OTHER PEOPLE TO TALK TO, IF POSSIBLE.
Two basic justifications for this rule: First, it'll help your credibility
(especially if you don't already know the reporter personally). Second,
multiple sources or witnesses usually enable the reporter to filter out
what is mere opinion or speculation from what everybody actually knows for
a fact.
4) DON'T ASSUME THAT THE REPORTER WILL COVER THE STORY THE WAY YOU'D LIKE
HER TO.
Reporters' accuracy and focus in a story are constrained by several
a) The amount of available time. Reporters have to be quick studies, and
often have to assimilate a complex story in a hurry. This necessarily
increases the risk of inaccuracy in a story, and gives you an even
greater reason to follow Rules 1 through 3.
2) The reporters' obligation to be fair. This means they have to talk to
people on the other side of the issues from you. This in turn means that
you're unlikely to get a story that represents or promotes your point of
view at the expense of those who oppose you.

Tim writes in the summary of Saturday's meeting:
Definitely at the Boston (Cambridge) site.
I am very sceptical that the "market share" strategy is the whole strategy
here. I think that while some proponents of Clipper may believe this is
the strategy, DOJ hopes that widespread adoption of Clipper will mute
any opposition to subsequent limitations on other encryption methods.
Let me clarify: I argued that asking tough questions could either force to
the government to reveal its hand or pin the government down to a
statement it would later have to admit was false.
We can only hope.
I believe this is precisely the reason we want to make powerful encryption
ubiquitous as soon as possible. And doing this is one of the reasons I
mentioned my hope for an eventual rapprochment between Jim Bidzos and Phil Zimmerman. Regardless of past disagreements, these two have a common
cause now, and we should strive to find a way to quell further public
disagreement and resolve as many differences as possible.
Another clarification: in response to a comment I made at the meeting,
Jim spoke at length about the validity of the RSA patent and about the
validity of his company's procedures. I want Jim and others to understand
that what I'm saying here should not be interpreted as an attack on Jim's
business strategy. I know that Jim is so used to being criticized about
the patent that he has standard responses to those criticisms, but I hope
it's clear that I wasn't criticizing him.
Yes, yes, yes.

Marc asks a bunch of legal questions:
Why presume this? Suppose the document doesn't directly incriminate
you (it doesn't say "I did this crime," for example), but, taken together
with other evidence the government has, does tend to incrimininate you.
In some circuits, at least, production of that document can be compelled.
(In others, there is a "last link" exception--the government can't compel
evidence that would constitute the "last link" in proving the government's
criminal case against you.)
Assume that the rules are the same for paper or electronic documents.
This has never been decided, but I think that, in terms of the relevant
legal precedents, they can. The rule is that you can be compelled to produce anything that is not, in itself, testimonial in nature and tending
to incriminate you. An encryption key, *taken by itself*, normally doesn't
tend to incriminate anyone--after all, it usually looks like gibberish.
See above. The Fifth Amendment bars compelled testimony. If what is
being compelled is not testimonial in nature, it doesn't violate the
More precisely, what I've said is that this is the argument the government
would make. In spirit, I think it violates the Fifth Amendment.
Possibly, in a circuit that recognizes the "last link" rule.
If you mean the smartcard itself, well, that can be compelled or But I take it you mean the key information.
There is an exception to the rule that nontestimonial stuff can be
compelled, and it's called, loosely, "the production privilege"--when
the very act of producing what is sought tends to incriminate you,
(by showing your ownership, control, authorship, or something similar),
compelled production may violate the Fifth Amendment.
But your question is more on the order of "What if the key is (or is derived from) a document that says 'I did this crime'?"
My answer is: "I don't know." But I should note that if you set up
elaborate schemes to block a law enforcement investigation that you
already know or have reason to believe is taking place, you may be
creating risk of criminal liability for obstruction of justice.
Yes. They can conclude that you're lying and cite you for contempt or
(if you say "I forgot" under oath) charge you with perjury. Remember,
courts and judges *frequently* have to decide whether people are
lying or not, and they could decide you're lying in this case.

Phil Karn asks:
I assume you're asking about civil versus criminal contempt. My tentative
answer (I can't look this up because my reference books are still packed)
is both. Civil contempt, strictly speaking, is not a separate legal
action--a federal judge has broad authority to impose civil-contempt
sanctions on people who are noncompliant with subpoenas, who disrupt court
proceedings, and so on. Criminal contempt *is* a separate legal action,
and I think you can be prosecuted for intentional noncompliance with court orders, but I'd have to look up the criminal-contempt statute to be sure.

What they don't realize is that, rather than reducing the risk of legal
liability, they are increasing it.

Any monitoring that results *directly* as a function of system maintenance
is okay--it's sanctioned by ECPA.

If they were really cautious, they'd talk to a lawyer before setting
policy based on some guess as to what their legal liabilities may be.

You could be extrapolating from Fidonet's refusal to *guarantee* e-mail
privacy (after all, how could Fidonet *enforce* it?) that all users
of every Fido BBS everywhere have waived their rights under ECPA.
My understanding is that Fidonet policy was drafted not in order to comply
with ECPA, but to acknowledge that, in this decentralized network, there
was no authority a user a could appeal to if his e-mail was not kept
private. But I'd be interested in seeing a direct quote of the policy
provision you're alluding to here. And what about me? I don't post from a Fido BBS, so even if there's a
Fidonet-wide waiver of ECPA rights, it's not a waiver *I* have agreed to.
What if mail from me passes through a Fido node on its way to a non-Fido
destination? Certainly, if they offer no mail at all, they're not liable, since no mail
passes through their systems.
But the interesting case is this: let's assume that you're right that all
Fido users everywhere have agreed to waive their ECPA rights. Then are the
sysops who reserve their right to read e-mail reading *all* e-mail that
passes through their systems?
If not, this puts the lie to the claim that they're limiting their
liability by reserving their right to read e-mail. After all, the
criminally significant communications may be the ones they're skipping.
In general, criminal liability depends on *knowledge*--you normally can't
be held criminally liable for acts and communications you didn't know
I know of no case in which a sysop has been held *civilly* liable for
failing to read all e-mail on his system. So, in terms of classic risk
analysis, what does that statistic tell you?
I wasn't referring you to any sysops.
If all your users have agreed to waive their e-mail privacy rights, and
you're not dealing with any mail that does not either originate or
terminate on your system, then you're not in violation of ECPA.

Absent waiver by users, this may still be an ECPA violation.
Item (1) is the relevant item--if users agree to waive their ECPA rights,
there's no legal problem, although there may be ethical ones.
As for (2), well, there's no legal theory that says that a sysop is liable
for for any illegal activity on his BBS. The criminal law, in general,
does not make people liable for the conduct of others in the absence of
knowledge of that conduct.
Please, please don't make assertions about criminal liability based on
FIDO mythology.
When you refer to the risk they're taking, could you be precise? What
statistics do you have that support the statement that FIDO sysops are at
risk if they allow encrypted communications? To my knowledge as a lawyer
who works in this area, no sysop has been held liable for allowing
encrypted communications on his or system.

One reason I gave out my number is to allow people to ask me specific
questions that refer to how they run their *specific* systems--it may be
that they're not risking ECPA liability, given the particular conditions
they're working under. But one think I think sysops need to realize is that ECPA is the *default*
On some of my interpretations of ECPA, reasonable lawyers may disagree,
but at this point most FIDO sysops who assert that ECPA doesn't apply
haven't read the statute.

That said, it should be noted that sysops can contract with users for
users to waive their privacy rights under ECPA. But I think sysops should
do this *explicitly*, and should not justify doing so because of vague
perceptions of vaguely understood legal liability.
I also have to take exception to the statement by some people here that
sysops never allow private e-mail. I knew sysops who routinely did so when
I lived in Austin. But maybe Austin is more enlightened than the rest of
the country.
I wouldn't say this quite so strongly, but Perry has the gist of it right.
If you take on the duty of monitoring e-mail, you risk creating liability
for yourself if something problematic doesn't get censored. And the sysops
here generally admit that they don't real *all* e-mail.

In my opinion, few if any BBSs qualify as common carriers. Common carriers
hold themselves out as accepting all goods or passengers (or, in the case
of communications, all messages) indifferently. I know of no sysop who
operates under such a policy, or who would want to. uunet, in contrast, probably does qualify as a common carrier.
My discussions of legal liability are not grounded in common-carrier law
(in which I'm not yet an expert) but in criminal law and tort law.

I don't want to play duelling credentials, and, as I said earlier, there
are some parts of ECPA over which reasonable lawyers can disagree. But
many of the assumptions some sysops make about a) whether they're exempt
from ECPA and b) whether they're if they don't read e-mail, and c)
whether it helps to have a sysop-can-read-e-mail policy when the sysop
does not in fact read all e-mail, and d) whether encryption creates a
special risk of liability for sysops strike me as pretty uninformed.
Note: even if the courts were to decide that I'm wrong on point (a), it's
irrelevant to points (b), (c), and (d) above. The notion that sysops have
some *legal* reason to ban encrypted messages is profoundly silly, and
unsupported by any caselaw anywhere. And you can quote me on that.
Avoidable, yes, but not by policies per se--sysops can avoid ECPA
liability by contracting with users or by limiting their viewing of
private mail to the specific restrictions of ECPA.
They're as frequent and successful as prosecutions of sysops for carrying
encrypted mail. Which is to say, there are no cases on point regarding
ECPA, but at least we know what the statute says. On the other hand,
there's no statute that says sysops will be criminally liable if they
don't ban encrypted communications.
The issue of common-carrier status isn't relevant to the points I've been
making here. I'm assuming that no BBS qualifies as a common carrier.
Please do not make the common layman mistake of supposing that arrest or
seizure equals criminal liability. If you want to talk about specific
cases, please cite them. It should be noted, however, that the Steve Jackson Games seizure occurred
even though there was no illegal material on his system.
You are mistaken.
But you still don't get it--there's no correlation between these seizures
and the use of truly private or encrypted e-mail.
No connection at all. Period. The link is entirely in some sysops' minds.
As well it should be. But common-carrier status is not the only way to
avoid legal liability.

There's a new consciousness of ECPA thanks in part to the efforts of EFF
and to Steve Jackson's successful ECPA case.
But, Al, the issue is less whether a particular sysop is going to be
prosecuted under ECPA than it is whether that sysop's conduct is *both*
legal and ethical.
Even if a sysop's policies fit within ECPA exceptions, it's dishonest to
justify such policies in terms of risks that don't exist. There is no
documented risk that a sysop will be at greater legal liability if he or
she allows encrypted mail.

Perry, he actually does touch on one exception under ECPA--viewing of
non-public messages during normal system maintenance. Also, a sysop can't
monitor for unlawful activity in general, but he or she can monitor
activity that may relate to the protection of the system from, say,
intruders. Think of this latter as the Cuckoo's Egg exception.
Let me be precise. I do know of systems that have been seized, not for
some crime of "illegal traffic," but because law enforcement believed that
the system contained evidence of a crime. I know of no case in which a
sysop has been "arrested" merely because of allowing so-called "illegal
traffic" that he or she didn't know about.

Uploading a GIF to a BBS is definitely a different issue from those raised
by ECPA, which has to do with electronic mail. For one thing, presumably
an uploaded GIF is not a private message, so there's no reason for the
sysop or anyone else not to look at it.
In a child-porn case, the sysop may be arrested, but his criminal
liability will likely depend on whether he knows about the image and his
knowledge can be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
Nothing I have written here should be construed as telling sysops they
can't look at a) public files on their systems, and b) private files on

Sec. 2517.  Authorization for disclosure and use of intercepted wire,
oral, or electronic communications
   (1) Any investigative or law enforcement officer who, by any means
authorized by this chapter, has obtained knowledge of the contents of any

performance of the official duties of the officer making or receiving the
   (2) Any investigative or law enforcement officer who, by any means
authorized by this chapter, has obtained knowledge of the contents of any
wire, oral, or electronic communication or evidence derived therefrom may
use such contents to the extent such use is appropriate to the proper
performance of his official duties.
   (3) Any person who has received, by any means authorized by this
chapter, any information concerning a wire, oral, or electronic
communication, or evidence derived therefrom intercepted in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter may disclose the contents of that
communication or such derivative evidence while giving testimony under
oath or affirmation in any proceeding held under the authority of the
United States or of any State or political subdivision thereof.
   (4) No otherwise privileged wire, oral, or electronic communication

therefrom, may be disclosed or used as provided in subsections (1) and (2)
of this section. Such contents and any evidence derived therefrom may be
used under subsection (3) of this section when authorized or approved by a
judge of competent jurisdiction where such judge finds on subsequent
application that the contents were otherwise intercepted in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter. Such application shall be made as
soon as practicable.
Sec. 2518.  Procedure for interception of wire, oral, or electronic
   (1) Each application for an order authorizing or approving the
interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication under this
chapter shall be made in writing upon oath or affirmation to a judge of
competent jurisdiction and shall state the applicant's authority to make
such application. Each application shall include the following
   (a) the identity of the investigative or law enforcement officer making
the application, and the officer authorizing the application;
   (b) a full and complete statement of the facts and circumstances relied
upon by the applicant, to justify his belief that an order should be
issued, including (i) details as to the particular offense that has been,
is being, or is about to be committed, (ii) except as provided in
subsection (11), a particular description of the nature and location of
the facilities from which or the place where the communication is to be
intercepted, (iii) a particular description of the type of communications
sought to be intercepted, (iv) the identity of the person, if known,
committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted;
   (c) a full and complete statement as to whether or not other
investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably
appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous;
   (d) a statement of the period of time for which the interception is
required to be maintained. If the nature of the investigation is such that
the authorization for interception should not automatically terminate when
the described type of communication has been first obtained, a particular
description of facts establishing probable cause to believe that
additional communications of the same type will occur thereafter;
   (e) a full and complete statement of the facts concerning all previous
applications known to the individual authorizing and making the
application, made to any judge for authorization to intercept, or for
approval of interceptions of, wire, oral, or electronic communications
involving any of the same persons, facilities or places specified in the
application, and the action taken by the judge on each such application;
   (f) where the application is for the extension of an order, a statement
setting forth the results thus far obtained from the interception, or a
reasonable explanation of the failure to obtain such results.
   (2) The judge may require the applicant to furnish additional testimony
or documentary evidence in support of the application.
   (3) Upon such application the judge may enter an ex parte order, as
requested or as modified, authorizing or approving interception of wire,
oral, or electronic communications within the territorial jurisdiction of
the court in which the judge is sitting (and outside that jurisdiction but
within the United States in the case of a mobile interception device
authorized by a Federal court within such jurisdiction), if the judge
determines on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant that--
   (a) there is probable cause for belief that an individual is
committing, has committed, or is about to commit a particular offense
enumerated in section 2516 of this chapter;
   (b) there is probable cause for belief that particular communications
concerning that offense will be obtained through such interception;
   (c) normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or
reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too
   (d) except as provided in subsection (11), there is probable cause for
belief that the facilities from which, or the place where, the wire, oral,
or electronic communications are to be intercepted are being used, or are
about to be used, in connection with the commission of such offense, or
are leased to, listed in the name of, or commonly used by such person.
   (4) Each order authorizing or approving the interception of any wire,
oral, or electronic communication under this chapter shall specify--
   (a) the identity of the person, if known, whose communications are to
be intercepted;
   (b) the nature and location of the communications facilities as to
which, or the place where, authority to intercept is granted;
   (c) a particular description of the type of communication sought to be
intercepted, and a statement of the particular offense to which it
   (d) the identity of the agency authorized to intercept the
communications, and of the person authorizing the application; and
   (e) the period of time during which such interception is authorized,
including a statement as to whether or not the interception shall
automatically terminate when the described communication has been first
   An order authorizing the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic
communication under this chapter shall, upon request of the applicant,
direct that a provider of wire or electronic communication service,
landlord, custodian or other person shall furnish the applicant forthwith
all information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to
accomplish the interception unobtrusively and with a minimum of
interference with the services that such service provider, landlord,
custodian, or person is according the person whose communications are to
be intercepted. Any provider of wire or electronic communication service,
landlord, custodian or other person furnishing such facilities or
technical assistance shall be compensated therefor by the applicant for
reasonable expenses incurred in providing such facilities or assistance.
   (5) No order entered under this section may authorize or approve the
interception of any wire, oral, or electronic communication for any period
longer than is necessary to achieve the objective of the authorization,
nor in any event longer than thirty days. Such thirty-day period begins on
the earlier of the day on which the investigative or law enforcement
officer first begins to conduct an interception under the order or ten
days after the order is entered. Extensions of an order may be granted,
but only upon application for an extension made in accordance with
subsection (1) of this section and the court making the findings required
by subsection (3) of this section. The period of extension shall be no
longer than the authorizing judge deems necessary to achieve the purposes
for which it was granted and in no event for longer than thirty days.
Every order and extension thereof shall contain a provision that the
authorization to intercept shall be executed as soon as practicable, shall
be conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of
communications not otherwise subject to interception under this chapter,
and must terminate upon attainment of the authorized objective, or in any
event in thirty days. In the event the intercepted communication is in a
code or foreign language, and an expert in that foreign language or code
is not reasonably available during the interception period, minimization
may be accomplished as soon as practicable after such interception. An
interception under this chapter may be conducted in whole or in part by
Government personnel, or by an individual operating under a contract with
the Government, acting under the supervision of an investigative or law
enforcement officer authorized to conduct the interception.
   (6) Whenever an order authorizing interception is entered pursuant to
this chapter, the order may require reports to be made to the judge who
issued the order showing what progress has been made toward achievement of
the authorized objective and the need for continued interception. Such
reports shall be made at such intervals as the judge may require.
   (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any
investigative or law enforcement officer, specially designated by the
Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney
General, or by the principal prosecuting attorney of any State or
subdivision thereof acting pursuant to a statute of that State, who
reasonably determines that--
   (a) an emergency situation exists that involves--
   (i) immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person,
   (ii) conspiratorial activities threatening the national security
interest, or
   (iii) conspiratorial activities characteristic of organized crime,
   that requires a wire, oral, or electronic communication to be
intercepted before an order authorizing such interception can, with due
diligence, be obtained, and
   (b) there are grounds upon which an order could be entered under this
chapter to authorize such interception,
   may intercept such wire, oral, or electronic communication if an
application for an order approving the interception is made in accordance
with this section within forty-eight hours after the interception has
occurred, or begins to occur. In the absence of an order, such
interception shall immediately terminate when the communication sought is
obtained or when the application for the order is denied, whichever is
earlier. In the event such application for approval is denied, or in any
other case where the interception is terminated without an order having
been issued, the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication
intercepted shall be treated as having been obtained in violation of this
chapter, and an inventory shall be served as provided for in subsection
(d) of this section on the person named in the application.
   (8)(a) The contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication
intercepted by any means authorized by this chapter shall, if possible, be
recorded on tape or wire or other comparable device. The recording of the
contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication under this
subsection shall be done in such way as will protect the recording from
editing or other alterations. Immediately upon the expiration of the
period of the order, or extensions thereof, such recordings shall be made
available to the judge issuing such order and sealed under his directions.
Custody of the recordings shall be wherever the judge orders. They shall
not be destroyed except upon an order of the issuing or denying judge and
in any event shall be kept for ten years. Duplicate recordings may be made
for use or disclosure pursuant to the provisions of subsections (1) and
(2) of section 2517 of this chapter for investigations. The presence of
the seal provided for by this subsection, or a satisfactory explanation
for the absence thereof, shall be a prerequisite for the use or disclosure
of the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication or evidence
derived therefrom under subsection (3) of section 2517.
   (b) Applications made and orders granted under this chapter shall be
sealed by the judge. Custody of the applications and orders shall be
wherever the judge directs. Such applications and orders shall be
disclosed only upon a showing of good cause before a judge of competent
jurisdiction and shall not be destroyed except on order of the issuing or
denying judge, and in any event shall be kept for ten years.
   (c) Any violation of the provisions of this subsection may be punished
as contempt of the issuing or denying judge.
   (d) Within a reasonable time but not later than ninety days after the
filing of an application for an order of approval under section 2518(7)(b)
which is denied or the termination of the period of an order or extensions
thereof, the issuing or denying judge shall cause to be served, on the
persons named in the order or the application, and such other parties to
intercepted communications as the judge may determine in his discretion
that is in the interest of justice, an inventory which shall include
notice of--
   (1) the fact of the entry of the order or the application;
   (2) the date of the entry and the period of authorized, approved or
disapproved interception, or the denial of the application; and
   (3) the fact that during the period wire, oral, or electronic
communications were or were not intercepted.
   The judge, upon the filing of a motion, may in his discretion make
available to such person or his counsel for inspection such portions of
the intercepted communications, applications and orders as the judge
determines to be in the interest of justice. On an ex parte showing of
good cause to a judge of competent jurisdiction the serving of the
inventory required by this subsection may be postponed.
   (9) The contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication
intercepted pursuant to this chapter or evidence derived therefrom shall
not be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing,
or other proceeding in a Federal or State court unless each party, not
less than ten days before the trial, hearing, or proceeding, has been
furnished with a copy of the court order, and accompanying application,
under which the interception was authorized or approved. This ten-day
period may be waived by the judge if he finds that it was not possible to
furnish the party with the above information ten days before the trial,
hearing, or proceeding and that the party will not be prejudiced by the
delay in receiving such information.
   (10)(a) Any aggrieved person in any trial, hearing, or proceeding in or
before any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other
authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision
thereof, may move to suppress the contents of any wire or oral
communication intercepted pursuant to this chapter, or evidence derived
therefrom, on the grounds that--
   (i) the communication was unlawfully intercepted;
   (ii) the order of authorization or approval under which it was
intercepted is insufficient on its face; or
   (iii) the interception was not made in conformity with the order of
authorization or approval.
   Such motion shall be made before the trial, hearing, or proceeding
unless there was no opportunity to make such motion or the person was not
aware of the grounds of the motion. If the motion is granted, the contents
of the intercepted wire or oral communication, or evidence derived
therefrom, shall be treated as having been obtained in violation of this
chapter. The judge, upon the filing of such motion by the aggrieved
person, may in his discretion make available to the aggrieved person or
his counsel for inspection such portions of the intercepted communication
or evidence derived therefrom as the judge determines to be in the
interests of justice.
   (b) In addition to any other right to appeal, the United States shall
have the right to appeal from an order granting a motion to suppress made
under paragraph (a) of this subsection, or the denial of an application
for an order of approval, if the United States attorney shall certify to
the judge or other official granting such motion or denying such
application that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay. Such
appeal shall be taken within thirty days after the date the order was
entered and shall be diligently prosecuted.
   (c) The remedies and sanctions described in this chapter with respect
to the interception of electronic communications are the only judicial
remedies and sanctions for nonconstitutional violations of this chapter
involving such communications.
   (11) The requirements of subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (3)(d) of this
section relating to the specification of the facilities from which, or the
place where, the communication is to be intercepted do not apply if--
   (a) in the case of an application with respect to the interception of
an oral communication--
   (i) the application is by a Federal investigative or law enforcement
officer and is approved by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney
General, the Associate Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General, or
an acting Assistant Attorney General;
   (ii) the application contains a full and complete statement as to why
such specification is not practical and identifies the person committing
the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted; and
   (iii) the judge finds that such specification is not practical; and
   (b) in the case of an application with respect to a wire or electronic
   (i) the application is by a Federal investigative or law enforcement
officer and is approved by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney
General, the Associate Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General, or
an acting Assistant Attorney General;
   (ii) the application identifies the person believed to be committing
the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted and the
applicant makes a showing of a purpose, on the part of that person, to
thwart interception by changing facilities; and
   (iii) the judge finds that such purpose has been adequately shown.
   (12) An interception of a communication under an order with respect to
which the requirements of subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (3)(d) of this
section do not apply by reason of subsection (11) shall not begin until
the facilities from which, or the place where, the communication is to be
intercepted is ascertained by the person implementing the interception
order. A provider of wire or electronic communications service that has
received an order as provided for in subsection (11)(b) may move the court
to modify or quash the order on the ground that its assistance with
respect to the interception cannot be performed in a timely or reasonable
fashion. The court, upon notice to the government, shall decide such a
motion expeditiously.
Sec. 2519.  Reports concerning intercepted wire, oral, or electronic
   (1) Within thirty days after the expiration of an order (or each
extension thereof) entered under section 2518, or the denial of an order
approving an interception, the issuing or denying judge shall report to
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts--

prosecuting attorney of a State, or the principal prosecuting attorney for
any political subdivision of a State, shall report to the Administrative
Office of the United States Courts--

   Whenever it shall appear that any person is engaged or is about to
engage in any act which constitutes or will constitute a felony violation
of this chapter, the Attorney General may initiate a civil action in a
district court of the United States to enjoin such violation. The court
shall proceed as soon as practicable to the hearing and determination of
such an action, and may, at any time before final determination, enter

   (A) were inadvertently obtained by the service provider; and
   (B) appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.
Sec. 2704.  Backup preservation
   (a) Backup preservation.
   (1) A governmental entity acting under section 2703(b)(2) may include
in its subpoena or court order a requirement that the service provider to
whom the request is directed create a backup copy of the contents of the
electronic communications sought in order to preserve those
communications. Without notifying the subscriber or customer of such
subpoena or court order, such service provider shall create such backup
copy as soon as practicable consistent with its regular business practices
and shall confirm to the governmental entity that such backup copy has
been made. Such backup copy shall be created within two business days
after receipt by the service provider of the subpoena or court order.
   (2) Notice to the subscriber or customer shall be made by the
governmental entity within three days after receipt of such confirmation,
unless such notice is delayed pursuant to section 2705(a).
   (3) The service provider shall not destroy such backup copy until the
later of--
   (A) the delivery of the information; or
   (B) the resolution of any proceedings (including appeals of any
proceeding) concerning the government's subpoena or court order.
   (4) The service provider shall release such backup copy to the
requesting governmental entity no sooner than fourteen days after the
governmental entity's notice to the subscriber or customer if such service
   (A) has not received notice from the subscriber or customer that the
subscriber or customer has challenged the governmental entity's request;
   (B) has not initiated proceedings to challenge the request of the
governmental entity.
   (5) A governmental entity may seek to require the creation of a backup
copy under subsection (a)(1) of this section if in its sole discretion
such entity determines that there is reason to believe that notification
under section 2703 of this title of the existence of the subpoena or court
order may result in destruction of or tampering with evidence. This
determination is not subject to challenge by the subscriber or customer or
service provider.
   (b) Customer challenges.
   (1) Within fourteen days after notice by the governmental entity to the
subscriber or customer under subsection (a)(2) of this section, such
subscriber or customer may file a motion to quash such subpoena or vacate
such court order, with copies served upon the governmental entity and with
written notice of such challenge to the service provider. A motion to
vacate a court order shall be filed in the court which issued such order.
A motion to quash a subpoena shall be filed in the appropriate United
States district court or State court. Such motion or application shall
contain an affidavit or sworn statement--
   (A) stating that the applicant is a customer or subscriber to the
service from which the contents of electronic communications maintained
for him have been sought; and
   (B) stating the applicant's reasons for believing that the records
sought are not relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry or that
there has not been substantial compliance with the provisions of this
chapter in some other respect.
   (2) Service shall be made under this section upon a governmental entity
by delivering or mailing by registered or certified mail a copy of the
papers to the person, office, or department specified in the notice which
the customer has received pursuant to this chapter. For the purposes of
this section, the term "delivery" has the meaning given that term in the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (3) If the court finds that the customer has complied with paragraphs
(1) and (2) of this subsection, the court shall order the governmental
entity to file a sworn response, which may be filed in camera if the
governmental entity includes in its response the reasons which make in
camera review appropriate. If the court is unable to determine the motion
or application on the basis of the parties' initial allegations and
response, the court may conduct such additional proceedings as it deems
appropriate. All such proceedings shall be completed and the motion or
application decided as soon as practicable after the filing of the
governmental entity's response.
   (4) If the court finds that the applicant is not the subscriber or
customer for whom the communications sought by the governmental entity are
maintained, or that there is a reason to believe that the law enforcement
inquiry is legitimate and that the communications sought are relevant to
that inquiry, it shall deny the motion or application and order such
process enforced. If the court finds that the applicant is the subscriber
or customer for whom the communications sought by the governmental entity
are maintained, and that there is not a reason to believe that the
communications sought are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement
inquiry, or that there has not been substantial compliance with the
provisions of this chapter, it shall order the process quashed.
   (5) A court order denying a motion or application under this section
shall not be deemed a final order and no interlocutory appeal may be taken
therefrom by the customer.
Sec. 2705.  Delayed notice
   (a) Delay of notification.
   (1) A governmental entity acting under section 2703(b) of this title
   (A) where a court order is sought, include in the application a
request, which the court shall grant, for an order delaying the
notification required under section 2703(b) of this title for a period not
to exceed ninety days, if the court determines that there is reason to
believe that notification of the existence of the court order may have an
adverse result described in paragraph (2) of this subsection; or
   (B) where an administrative subpoena authorized by a Federal or State
statute or a Federal or State grand jury subpoena is obtained, delay the
notification required under section 2703(b) of this title for a period not
to exceed ninety days upon the execution of a written certification of a
supervisory official that there is reason to believe that notification of
the existence of the subpoena may have an adverse result described in
paragraph (2) of this subsection.
   (2) An adverse result for the purposes of paragraph (1) of this
subsection is--
   (A) endangering the life or physical safety of an individual;
   (B) flight from prosecution;
   (C) destruction of or tampering with evidence;
   (D) intimidation of potential witnesses; or
   (E) otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly
delaying a trial.
   (3) The governmental entity shall maintain a true copy of certification
under paragraph (1)(B).
   (4) Extensions of the delay of notification provided in section 2703 of
up to ninety days each may be granted by the court upon application, or by
certification by a governmental entity, but only in accordance with
subsection (b) of this section.
   (5) Upon expiration of the period of delay of notification under
paragraph (1) or (4) of this subsection, the governmental entity shall
serve upon, or deliver by registered or first-class mail to, the customer
or subscriber a copy of the process or request together with notice that--
   (A) states with reasonable specificity the nature of the law
enforcement inquiry; and
   (B) informs such customer or subscriber--
   (i) that information maintained for such customer or subscriber by the
service provider named in such process or request was supplied to or
requested by that governmental authority and the date on which the
supplying or request took place;
   (ii) that notification of such customer or subscriber was delayed;
   (iii) what governmental entity or court made the certification or
determination pursuant to which that delay was made; and
   (iv) which provision of this chapter allowed such delay.
   (6) As used in this subsection, the term "supervisory official" means
the investigative agent in charge or assistant investigative agent in
charge or an equivalent of an investigating agency's headquarters or
regional office, or the chief prosecuting attorney or the first assistant
prosecuting attorney or an equivalent of a prosecuting attorney's
headquarters or regional office.
   (b) Preclusion of notice to subject of governmental access. A
governmental entity acting under section 2703, when it is not required to
notify the subscriber or customer under section 2703(b)(1), or to the
extent that it may delay such notice pursuant to subsection (a) of this
section, may apply to a court for an order commanding a provider of
electronic communications service or remote computing service to whom a
warrant, subpoena, or court order is directed, for such period as the
court deems appropriate, not to notify any other person of the existence
of the warrant, subpoena, or court order. The court shall enter such an
order if it determines that there is reason to believe that notification
of the existence of the warrant, subpoena, or court order will result in--
   (1) endangering the life or physical safety of an individual;
   (2) flight from prosecution;
   (3) destruction of or tampering with evidence;
   (4) intimidation of potential witnesses; or
   (5) otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly
delaying a trial.
Sec. 2706.  Cost reimbursement
   (a) Payment. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a
governmental entity obtaining the contents of communications, records, or
other information under section 2702, 2703, or 2704 of this title shall
pay to the person or entity assembling or providing such information a fee
for reimbursement for such costs as are reasonably necessary and which
have been directly incurred in searching for, assembling, reproducing, or
otherwise providing such information. Such reimbursable costs shall
include any costs due to necessary disruption of normal operations of any
electronic communication service or remote computing service in which such
information may be stored.
   (b) Amount. The amount of the fee provided by subsection (a) shall be
as mutually agreed by the governmental entity and the person or entity
providing the information, or, in the absence of agreement, shall be as
determined by the court which issued the order for production of such
information (or the court before which a criminal prosecution relating to
such information would be brought, if no court order was issued for
production of the information).
   (c) Exception. The requirement of subsection (a) of this section does
not apply with respect to records or other information maintained by a
communications common carrier that relate to telephone toll records and
telephone listings obtained under section 2703 of this title. The court
may, however, order a payment as described in subsection (a) if the court
determines the information required is unusually voluminous in nature or
otherwise caused an undue burden on the provider.
Sec. 2707.  Civil action
   (a) Cause of action. Except as provided in section 2703(e), any
provider of electronic communication service, subscriber, or customer
aggrieved by any violation of this chapter in which the conduct
constituting the violation is engaged in with a knowing or intentional
state of mind may, in a civil action, recover from the person or entity

I doubt that EFF is regularly going to have a list of graphics files that
the feds are using as the basis of a child-porn investigation.
I don't see how letting people know what the feds are looking for is
"helping" the feds.
In particular, I've been talking about noninterference with electronic
mail. But look at our choices, Lance. The alternative, when we knew what
files were being looked for, was *not to let anyone know*. It strikes me
as difficult, ethically, to justify *not* letting people know what
particular files are being looked for.
The issue of letting people know about these files is logically separate
from the issue of whether a sysop will be held legally liable for files he
or she doesn't know about.
Not quite. In real life, those who traffic in GIFs normally deal in such a
volume of files that they rarely trouble to change their names.
Sometimes telling the truth *does* generate paranoia. Look, it is
difficult for me to justify *not* giving sysops information that a *lot*
of sysops (although perhaps not you, Lance) would very much like to have.
What's more, a sysop can determine whether he's had files with these names
uploaded to his system *without snooping through someone's e-mail*.
Tell you what, Lance: if you can find a number of sysops who would *rather
not know* the kind of information that Shari disclosed in her message, we
will weigh their reluctance to know carefully if this situation should
ever come up again.
I think I'll wait until I see this actually happen before I regard it as a
serious possibility.
If what you are doing here is criticizing the *wording* of the

saying it would be *okay* to release the list of graphics files if we had
written the announcement differently.
If that is the substance of your criticism, fine. Send us a redrafted

we had discovered about a particular federal investigation.

EFF has been convinced of this since the beginning. The last thing EFF
wants is to have the government build the national information
infrastructure. Instead, we want to encourage both a variety of
information conduits, with a high degree of interoperability, but built by
private enterprise. The idea of the Open Platform (see our papers at
ftp.eff.org) is for private enterprise to create an environment in which
*anyone*--not just a media giant--can become an information provider, and
in which any BBS has the potential to become the WELL or CompuServe, or
whatever it likes.
Since both the telcos and the cable companies already operate under a high
degree of regulation, the issue isn't whether government should play no
role--it's already playing a pretty serious role. Instead, the issue is
how the government can reduce its regulatory role and at the same time
increase incentives for the kind of flexible, switched networks that
support the many-to-many paradigm rather than the traditional one-to-one
paradigm of the telcos or the one-to-many paradigm of the broadcasters.
The result should be a highly competitive environment with less need for
regulation, whether we're talking about local-loop telephone service or
computer-based conferencing systems.
EFF thinks these things will happen anyway, and is not interested in
having the government do them.
The notion of government-funded information superhighways, as originally
conceived, is already dead, killed by lack of government money (just as
the supercollider was killed). EFF supports NREN, but only as a testbed
for what the NII is eventually going to look like--we can learn a lot
about how networks run by studying the controlled anarchy and the support
of information niches that exists on the Net.
It is commonly thought that EFF supports some kind of massive government
undertaking to build the information infrastructure. But those who read
our position papers at ftp.eff.org know different.

First of all, EFF's Open Platform says outright that the government is not
going to build the data superhighway. Check again if you don't believe me.
Second, I think it's possible that you may be conflating discussions of one
kind of superhighway--a government-funded and -operated one--with discussions
of what kind of superhighway we might ultimately have if private
enterprise builds it. EFF does not the establishment of a big government
operation--instead, it wants the government, since it's spending money on
connectivity and bandwidth for its own purposes, to spend the money in a
way that promotes an infrastructure that everyone can use.
Since the money is going to be spent by government no matter what, why not
get them to spend it in the right way?
Furthermore, EFF wants a world of less regulation of communications
providers, not more. But since we live in a highly regulated world
now (witness telephone service and cable), the issue is how to get to a
world with the least possible regulation and the most competition among
private-enterprise providers, and yet keep the benefits of Universal Service and an open communications system. For EFF, the way to do that is to
give communications conduit providers (who also will be content providers)
incentives to keep the channels as open as the public highways are.
This doesn't involve big, expensive government projects; what it requires
is policies with a vision of an open market, built on an open
infrastructure, in the 21st century.
But don't think that, in the absence of EFF-supported policy, you don't
get data superhighways. Tim, you're going to get those no matter what.
The only question is whether you get something like what the interactive
cable companies promoted at Hackers--just an enhanced version of the Home
Shopping Network--or whether you get something like the current public
switched network, in which individuals can use a phone line for whatever

For one thing, I get cypherpunks here.
I note that those who produce newspapers, television, radio, etc., also
use the same highways and the same phone system. Good infrastructure
design unleashes free markets.
Tim, I think one has to distinguish between "guaranteed access" along the
Local Access Cable model and access along the "universal service" model.
Local Access Cable is next to useless as a democratic medium, and EFF
would not support any guarantee of access along those lines. But
universal service, along the Theodore Vail model, is different.
Remember, we have universal service now, but people still have to pay
their phone bills. And when we get competition in the local loop (a
competition that will require changes in the infrastructure), people's
residential phone payments will, in general, pay for the cost of operation
of their service.
Ithiel de Sola Pool's discussions of how to get government-supported
and -regulated monopolies to move to free-market models are extremely

to be an information provider as well as consumer. There's money to be
made here, and lots of entrepreneurial opportunities, if the thing is done right.
You know, I was just thinking of Tim's comment about how he punted his
cable service. One of the reasons that cable is just "a vaster wasteland"
is that it follows the old cable/broadcaster paradigm--get a
government-supported, government-regulated monopoly in place, and let a
single provider (or a small set of providers) funnel their product into
the home.
But cable service would be far more valuable to me (and I'd pay more for
it) if I could, say, upload a video of my little girl taking her first
steps and send it to Tim. (Not that he'd necessarily pay for that
privilege, but you get the idea.)

I agree about the potential for it to be free, but, I gotta tell you, the
monopolists running the cable systems in this country have no inclination
to share that nearly free bandwidth with you, even if you're willing to
pay for access to it.
In order to get to a world in which free markets can meet our demand for
high-bandwidth connectivity, we have to dig ourselves out from the market-failure position we're in now. And because government is part of
the problem, changing government policy is part of the solution. So,
that's one of the major thrusts of EFF's NII policy.

That might be one solution. It certainly will be part of the ultimate
Which cable company has to eat the cost of digging the original
groundwork? Or are you saying that every new cable entity will have to lay its own infrastructure? The capital costs of that create an
immense barrier to market entry, and ease of market entry is a
pre-requisite for free-market competition.
The only reason the first cable companies even invested in laying cable is
that they were guaranteed a local monopoly. Since government, in effect,
participated in the creation of that part of the infrastructure, there are
serious issues as to whether the first cable provider in a local area
should continue to profit from a government-granted incentive while new
potential providers are left high and dry.
These are the kinds of issues that need to be addressed as we move from
monopoly to free-market competition--how do we correct for the distortions
caused by the initial government intervention in the market?
"Market failure" is a term of art. It refers to a condition, which
may in fact be caused by government, in which market mechanisms have been
prevented from ensuring competition.

Is that true? How many slots are there? Is access to the slot unregulated?
The question is less one of creating new conduits than of seeing that the
conduits already in place (invariably under a government regulatory
regime, if not an outright monopoly) get used to their fullest potential.
Perry, you think that just letting things happen alone means that
someone's going to give you purchasable video uplink. I'm glad to hear it,
but I don't share you belief. Where we do agree, of course, is that access
to the cable part of the infrastructure (whether by building new conduits
or allocating sections of existing ones) shouldn't be subsidized by
government money, except of course to the extent that the government is
buying such services for itself.
I wouldn't say this is accurate. Even in multiple-cable areas, I
understand, the cable companies have government licenses and operate under
government regulation.
In the Boston area, there are multiple cable companies, but you can't
choose which one your particular home will use if you subscribe to cable.
Do those electric companies each have different wires? So that if I move into the house where you used to live, and you bought power from
company X, I can call up company Y and say "You're supplying power here
now"? How is this implemented.
I don't think discussion of "natural monopolies" is relevant here, because
it doesn't matter whether the monopolies that exist are natural or not.
They're here in any case.
I disagree that it's possible for all cable utilities to do this. If
you're the second cable system in a duopoly, maybe. But I don't know of a
debt market that will buy the bonds of the tenth cable company to lay
cable in a certain area. If you know of one, let's start it together--lots
of money to be made in cable!
I regularly read Cato Institute publications and white papers.

This doesn't sound like a true free market to me--there are barriers other
than mere price to switching among power providers. It will be cheaper in
terms of opportunity costs to stay with the same provider.
Contrast this with long-distance services, where competition forces
providers to give you incentives to switch.
I just don't see how whether we agree on the existence of natural
monopolies or not has to do with this discussion. We both think the
monopolies and government subsidies should end.
Okay, now let's look at Tim May's hypothetical case. Tim wants X-rated
cable. But the first nine cable companies don't want to provide it. And
the Metzger-Godwin Cable operation, which would provide it, can't get
financing. There's a market for it, but there's also a barrier to entry.
If the only way to reach that market is to invest independently in one's
own infrastructure, then that market simply goes unsatisfied--no
reasonable entrepreneur would bother.
I leave to your imagination what happens in the event that we *do* start the P-G Cable company, but content providers won't sell other
programming to us so Tim is forced to choose between only X-rated
cable--us--and cable services that provide other kinds of programming.
(Tim may have no problem with this, but lots of other people in our market
will want to watch CNN as well as X-rated videos.) And don't forget that the cable infrastructure we're talking about
duplicating here includes coax to the individual home. So, when Tim
decides to switch over to P-G, we've got to go out to his house and
install a brand-new cable and yank out the old one--we can't just
turn on the existing cable. This is the consequence of duplicating cable
My understanding, by the way, is that cable in multi-provider areas is not
duplicated--that when a municipality awards a contract to a new cable
bidder, they don't yank out the old cable or add a whole new cable
infrasture. Instead, they turn the existing infrastructure over to a new
provider. So, what happens when, in a system in which the only way one can enter as
a competitor is to invest in a whole new infrasture, and nobody will fund
it, and the existing cable companies won't carry your service? How does
the market, in a world that treats cable in the ground as somebody's
private conduit rather than as true infrastructure, provide Tim his
X-rated cable service?
Wouldn't it be better to live in a world in which the cable
infrastructure, like the telephone infrastructure, could be serviced by
competing providers, and at the individual level? We already have this
with long-distance--if I want, I can have Sprint, MCI, *and* AT&T accounts
and use them all from the same phone. Ultimately we'll have it in the
local loop.
In this world, Tim could contract with Warner Cable to get some of their
programming, and with P-G Cable to get that little something Xtra that
helps him get through the day. All this illustrates is the inadequacy of comparing air providers to
infrasture providers.
Why? I've already read their stuff. Reading is not the same thing as
Oh, you're saying that one couldn't make a phone call from one local phone
company to another?
I'm not. I think they should be eliminated.

Doug, I think you may be under the impression that we're talking about a
single fiber-optic or coax cable. You can have a single (or double or
triple) infrastructural network, but add bandwidth to each one. I think
the notion of "scarcity" doesn't apply to cable any more than it applies
to personal computers.
Or you add a new cable. Not hard. Nothing I have ever read has suggested
that "scarcity," as that term is normally used in reference to a resource,
applies in any meaningful way to cable. I believe that Perry's prediction

It's not that simple, unfortunately. Once monopolies have been created
with government support, removing government intervention doesn't automatically make competition happen.
Compare it to strip-mining: once a strip mine has dug up the landscape,
the mere decision to stop mining doesn't automatically restore the land to
the status quo ante, or even to an environment in which any kind of
ecosystem can flourish.

It's like strip mining in this sense: stopping the intervention doesn't
restore the healthy previous condition automatically. Merely ending
regulation doesn't make the distortions go away.
Just so. If you really believe that merely stopping regulation, *without
anything else*, would restore competition to a market that's been
dominated by a government-supported monopoly or duopoly, then we simply
must agree to disagree.
Untrue. The cable providers often are putting up obstacles of their own, as
are telco providers. The impossibility of Tim May's X-rated cable channel
illustrates this point. The market can't function--Tim and those like him
who want a certain type and variety of programming--unless there is access
to the information infrastructure. Telling every would-be X-rated cable
viewer to build his own cable system is not a solution.
According to standard free-market theory, the existence of demand
(Tim and friends) for an affordable product ought to stimulate a supplier
for that product. But that will never happen if all we do is say to the
cable and telco providers "Well, we've given you these markets and allows
you to profit enormously and to have absolute ability to use nonmarket
mechanisms to squash any hint of serious competition, and now we're going
to just dust off our hands and walk away."

First, I wasn't talking about the local-loop competition. I was talking about
cable. I don't doubt that in *some* monopoly situations, mere reduction or
elimination of regulation can allow markets to spring up. I just don't
think this is true with regard to telcos and cable.
Secondly, and as I mentioned, there are non-market tactics that a supplier
can use to prevent competition from arising. For example, why should a local
telco decide on its own to be interoperable with, say, the Electric
Company? What market share can a monopoly gain by giving access to
competition? None. It can only *lose* market share.
It's always a mistake to confuse technical feasibility for competition.
What's to prevent the dominant one or two providers (TPC and Cellular,
let's say) from closing out the others by refusing to be interoperable?

Right. And the telcos would love to carry phone-sex services. Your suspicion would be incorrect. Current providers tend not to want to
carry sexually explicit services because it hurts their image. For
example, the telcos didn't want to support 900-number phone-sex services,
in spite of the fact that there is a very clear market for them, because
they didn't want to do any business for and with the phone-sex companies.
See, e.g., Sable Communications v. FCC.
If your characterization were correct, the phone companies would be dying
to carry phone-sex services. In real life, however, they keep petitioning
regulatory bodies to allow them not to carry them.
Thanks for the capital letters--I am getting a little nearsighted in my
old age.
But your analysis hear assumes that, given a clear and profitable market,
any rational provider would cater to it. Even in the absence of legal
sanctions, this isn't true, as Sable Communications and other cases
clearly show.

It's worth noting that the perceived problem with Lance Detweiler is a
problem that sooner or later surfaces in all forums, whether they're
mailing lists or newsgroups--namely, the problem of a certain person or
subject matter driving people away from the forum.
Fleeing the problem doesn't fix it. It recurs wherever you go.
Solving the problem in a top-down way (e.g., by banning a person from a
forum) doesn't fix it, and that kind of centralized-censorship solution
runs counter to the dynamic of the Net, which is not structured to support
centralized censorship. (Theoretically, mailing lists are structured that
way, but in practice anything but the most light-handed moderation tends
to kill the spontaneity of discussions.)
The best solutions are bottom-up solutions: solutions in which individuals
can make choices about what they wish to see, but can't impose those
choices on others. These solutions take many forms. The least sophisticated, and the least
effective, is to unsubscribe from a "noisy" list--as I noted before, the
problem recurs on all forums. A better solution is to ignore the noisy
postings--this is the Detweiler Pledge Solution. Still better is the
artful use of mail filters. (A nonartful use of filters may prevent some

 Note on usage: *boldface* type indicates word being defined;  _italic_ type indicates word defined elsewhere in Cylex or used  as an example.
 *Antilex*:  (n)  a variant on _Cylex_Ê published by a shifting  coalition of _e-pubs_Ê who feel that Cylex is often both  inaccurate (because slanted toward the government viewpoint)  and out of date.
 *autolott*:  (n)  short for *auto*mated *lott*ery, this is the  standard form of lottery now run by most major companies, the  federal government, and all state governments except Utah.   Most digital transfers now automatically cause the  destination/recipient to be encoded and dropped into a lottery  pool, from which prize drawings are then made.  This form of  lottery, in which one does not have to actively play to win, is an  outgrowth of the credit-card pools of the 1990s. Autolotts were  devised in part as a corporate marketing method to get around  the highly successful _doorman_ programs.  *black bank*:  (n) an underground institution for generating and  distributing digital signatures outside the government-approved  three-bank scheme.  Black banks tend to be small and to go in  and out of business quickly as they are usually unable to sustain  the integrity of their security schemes and thus can lose all their  business literally overnight.  Although not technically illegal,  they cater to an amorphous and shifting population of criminals  and _clans_ who for one reason or another don't trust the  integrity of the national digital-signature scheme.  The Russian,  South African, Korean, and Caribbean mafias are all known to  run their own black banks.
 *bureaucrat*:  (n) obsolete; see _hulk_.
 *bodyguard*:  (n) general term covering localized software that  searches out and destroys viruses, worms, trojan horses,  scavengers, and other net wildlife. The U.S. government has  imposed severe restrictions on bodyguards to ensure that they  don't run loose in the net. (See also: _cannibal, hulk._)
 *borden*:  (n) any nondigital object that figures as evidence in  a legal proceeding, especially under criminal law.  Since most  legal proceedings are now carried out entirely in cyberspace,  lawyers have largely lost the ability to sway juries by showing  them physical evidence of crimes. In cases where such evidence  is important, prosecutors (rarely defense lawyers) often pursue  strategies to get the case transferred from cyberspace to real-
 space courtrooms.  Hence (v) _to borden_ means to obtain or  try to obtain such a change of venue.  The word derives  indirectly from the bloodstained ax that played such a  prominent role in the conviction of Lizzie Borden for the  murder of her parents.  See also the phrase: _borden of proof_.
 *cannibal*:  (n) a special form of _bodyguard_ that will wipe  out everything on its home computer net, including itself, once  activated.  Popular among criminals for destroying digital  evidence beyond the possibility of recovery, they can be set to  react to time delays, improper logons, remotes, and other  tripwires.  There are a number of different types of cannibal,  only a few of which are dangerous to humans. Those  incorporating explosives are known as _challengers_ (in  reference to an early space shuttle that blew up, taking out  seven astronauts in the process), while those causing  electrocution of the person trying to access the data are known  as _headhunters_.  *cat-tag*:  (n)  a digital signature for corporations and other  businesses; legally required for all business e-mail and data  transfers over the net.  The word is a short form of "catalog tag"  and also probably a back-formation from _dogtag._ Cat-tags  came into use after the first flood of digital junk mail; the  ensuing consumer protests brought about the adoption of cat-
 tags that could be screened by _doorman_ programs. The  government used the controversy to institute compulsory  registration of digital signatures in so-called _name banks_.  Cat-tags are handled by one of the three major signature banks,  the First National Name Bank (a subsidiary of Citicorp).   *clan*:  (n) a type of on-line voluntary organization formed  among private individuals to exchange information and pursue  group activities in a limited forum.  The word is an acronym  whose expansion is disputed; according to most authorities it  stands for *c*ompound *l*ocal *a*rea *n*etwork, but popular  etymology usually gives it as short for *c*ol*la*borative *n*et.  Clans sprang up in the wake of the Clinton administration's  disastrous health care reform and the information deluge  released in cyberspace by the gradual dismantling of the  copyright laws.  In order to reassert control over the quality of  information, advice, and services given and received, people  spontaneously started forming small, tightly knit groups on the  net, usually in the form of _lockout_ forums.  Typically, a clan  is started by a few close friends, and over time they gradually  lock in new members of complementary professions.  For  example, a group that had no doctor member would recruit  someone compatible from the on-line and/or off-line  community.  However, there are also highly specialized clans,  such as the craft clans and the _Tertians_.  Some clans have  membership fees, but most work primarily on a barter system,  such that members work a certain numbers of hours a year for  each other. It is considered a mark of status to be recruited by a  prestigious clan.
 *Cylex*:  (n) the on-line lexicon of slang continuously  published and updated by the U.S. government in accordance  with a 2003 mandate of Congress.  In a series of landmark  discrimination cases, it was argued that since slang is such a  vital aspect of cyberspace life, anyone who couldn't master it is  effectively excluded from large parts of the net.  Moreover, the  speed with which net slang evolves serves to bar anyone who  isn't a net regular.  Hence, Cylex was set up as a _tilde_  resource to equalize access to the net.  It can be downloaded by  anyone, at any time.  In theory, it is kept up to date; however,  the true lag time is considered to be between six and eight  weeks.  In addition, there are always pockets of long-term ex-
 Cylex slang on the net; these tend to be formed by people who  intentionally use slang (rather than encryption) as an  exclusionary method and actively resist having their terms  become transparent to Cylex.  Since Cylex depends greatly on  volunteers (its paid staff is small and the project is permanently  underfunded), it is not difficult for determined groups to keep  personal slang Cylex-opaque for relatively long periods.
 *DD*:  (n, a) acronym for *d*ownload *d*ate, usually given in  numerals in the form  DDyear.month.day.hour:minute:secondGMT.  The standard  international dating procedure on the net, it is sometimes  extended to include fractions of a second.  DDs are normally  the first term in any downloaded data and may be further  subdivided into _DDB_ (*d*ownload *d*ate *b_egin, at the  start of transmission) and _DDE_ (*download *d*ate *e*nd, at  the end of transmission).  "Created on" dates are still sometimes  seen, especially attached to certain fixed forms of artwork, but  are considered obsolete because unverifiable.  (See also:  _genealogy, sourcing_).
 *digsig*:  (n) semi-official slang for *dig*ital *sig*nature; the  U.S. government in particular avoids the use of the otherwise  universal _dogtag_.
 *diy forgery*:  (n)   1. a plan, diagram, or other type of  instruction for making and/or performing artworks issued by  artists themselves, usually through the _Municipal Dump_.   2.  an object or process created using such instructions.
 Most artists do not actually make objects anymore but simply  register the plans and/or instructions with the MD, which holds  them in a database and distributes them at a nominal charge.  One popular activity is to combine several different sets of diy  forgery, either simultaneously or sequentially. (See also:   _kunstmorph_.)  Diy forgeries (short for *d*o-*i*t-*y*ourself  *forgeries*) are sometimes referred to as authorized forgeries.  *dogtag*:  (n) slang for digital signature generally, derived  from the military slang for tags recording one's identification  number.  Usually used to refer to digital signatures of  individuals, while _cat-tag is reserved for business-related  digital signatures.  Dogtags are handled by two of the three  major signature banks, the _Federal Name Repository_ (under  the Federal Reserve Bank) and 21st Century Names (a  subsidiary of Time Warner).
 *doorman*:  (n) a computer program used to screen incoming  data, especially e-mail and junk mail, for unwanted items.   Doormen became popular after the federal government began to  deliver subpoenas electronically and disputes arose over the  point at which an e-subpoena could be said to have been  accepted.  Any item that passes a doorman is now considered to  have been received by the gateway computer and hence also by  its registered owner.  Most doormen also incorporate  _bodyguards_.
 *doormat*:  (n) an ineffective _doorman_.
 *download from/to*:  (v)  _download from_ means to copy data  off a data source such as a net; _download to_ means to copy  data to such a data source.  Download to has completely  replaced the now-obsolete _upload to_, which fell out of use as  the hierarchical (and psychological) distinctions between large  (central, multiuser) and small (personal) computers vanished in  the late 1990s.
 *dwarfing*:  (n)  a common method for including _source_  information in digital files by reducing the information packet  greatly in size and embedding it in some other part of the data.  As dwarfing often involves actual data compression as well, it  is one of the more difficult forms of hidden sourcing to recover.
 *e-* : prefix for electronic; used generally as a synonym for on-
 line and specifically to differentiate something from its off-line  counterpart; e.g., an _e-zine_ would normally refer to a zine  that has no real-world counterpart.
 *e-cash*:  (n) digital money. Coins and bills are ordinarily used  only for very small purchases and also on the black market.
 *e-pub_: (n) an electronic publisher, as distinct from a _p&t  publisher_.
 *Federal Name Repository*:  (n) federal name bank for  generating and storing the digital signatures (encryption keys)  that replaced social security numbers as of 2009.  The  government now generates a pair of keys for every child as  soon as its birth is registered; the public key serves the same  functions as the old social-security number and in addition is  used to encode certain data throughout an individual's life that  will be accessible to that person only.  The child's private key is  kept under wraps at the FNR until his or her 18th birthday, at  which point it is turned over to that individual alone.  *fortune hunt*:  (n, v)  a search for hidden information in data  files (such as e-catalogs, e-zines, and e-books) that entitles the  finder to a prize.  These are in vogue among puzzle enthusiasts  generally but nowhere near as popular or lucrative as the  _autolotts_.
 *genealogy*:  (n)  a new specialty within the field of art history  and criticism, genealogy consists of interpreting artistic trends  and developments by tracing the ramifications of _source_ lists  through different generations of image transfer, duplication,  alteration, etc.  Genealogists tend to be looked down on by  traditional art historians because most of their data are  inherently unreliable.
 *Generics*:  (n)  an e-zine published by the _Municipal Dump_  and featuring the theory and practice of generic art.  In the  1990s, the activities of the Museum of Forgery and others  brought about a shift in focus from brand-name art (e.g.,  Leonardo's Mona Lisa) to generic categories of art (e.g., "mona-
 lisas"; that is, works related to the Mona Lisa).  Each issue of  _Generics_ normally has a person, style, period, or individual  work as its theme, and generic works created by artists on that  theme are published. Making appropriate attributions (rather  than listing works under the names of their actual creators) is a  central activity of _Generics_.  As a rule, issues are updated  annually; the two most popular issues, on baldessaris and  posthumous duchamps, run over 1000 pages of hardcopy  apiece.
 *hibachi*:  (n)  a photograph known or presumed to have been  altered; much in use by the legal profession.  The term came  into use in the late 1990s, often sarcastically, when a series of  court cases hinging on disputed photographic evidence led to  severe restrictions on the use of photographs (and later videos)  as evidence.  The phrase traces back to a remark by a Vietnam  War general, William Westmoreland, who dismissed a famous  photograph of napalmed Vietnamese children running down a  road as a "hibachi accident."  *homebase*:  (n)  the original source of data or other  information, usually presumed to be a guarantee that it is  unaltered and/or of high quality.  Early concerns about the need  to protect against data piracy through more stringent copyright  laws vanished when it became clear that people were willing to  pay for homebase material in order to protect themselves  against corrupt or infected files.  (It was actually possible to  market homebase material for some time before the advent of  _dogtags_ and _e-cash_ made it really practical to do so.)
 *hulk*:  (n) also: Hulk.  An ineffective _bodyguard_.  The term  comes from the name of Hulk Hogan, a one-time professional  wrestler; the implication is that a hulk looks like it's doing its  job but does not do any real damage to its opponent.  Hulk  replaces the formerly popular _bureaucrat.
 *hypgnostic*:  (n) variant spelling of _hypnostic_.
 *hypnostic*:  (n) a computer program that can induce varying  levels of hypnosis or trance states in the user under controlled  conditions.  Usually in the form of rapidly metamorphosing,  often geometric images combined with a sound track,  hypnostics are an outgrowth of research into the long-term  neurological effects of screen-saver programs.  Although they  have become popular adjuncts to meditation, therapy, and  recreational drug use, there is continuing controversy over  parallel military research that has led to the development of  programs that can induced severe disorientation, hallucination,  phobia, catatonia, schizophrenia, and other forms of mental  breakdown.  Hypnostics are also implicated in the premature  development of cataracts, and most regular hypnostics users  suffer from semi-permanent facial tics in the region of the eyes.
 *interrupt*:  (n, a)  used to signal that a data transmission will  not go through as requested or will be terminated before  completion; normally followed by reason for the interrupt.
 *kunstmorph*:  (n, v) an activity in which one chooses two  artworks and creates a metamorphic sequence between them.   Most popular as a digital process, it is also a common off-line  activity among the craft _clans._
 *lockin*:  (n, a)  a part of cyberspace to which one has a  password.  Similarly, to _lock in_ (v) means to give someone a  cyberpass.
 *lockout*:  (n) any part of cyberspace to which one does not  have the password.  Similarly, to _lock out_ (v).
 *MD Pound*:  (n) a recycling center run by the _Municipal  Dump_ in most major cities to which anyone can bring  artworks for destruction, exchange, or recycling.  MD Pounds  work on an exchange principle; for every pound of materials  one donates, one is entitled to take away an equivalent  poundage.  They grew out of the environmental aesthetic, which  recognized that artists who created much more than they  destroyed were guilty of a form of littering.  The MD Pound  logo features the mustaches of Salvador Dali, a notably prolific  20th century surrealist.
 *Municipal Dump*:  (n)  an institution formed by the  Macarthur Foundation in 2117 to act as a clearinghouse for  nonobject artists.  The name comes from the common slang  used to denote museums generally and New York's  Metropolitan Museum in particular ("municipal dump" replaced  the formerly popular "mausoleum").  The MD's main functions  include maintaining a digital database of artworks, publishing  _Generics_, and distributing _diy forgeries_.  The MD also  maintains MD Pounds_ in major cities.  The MD logo features  the mustache-and-goatee from Marcel Duchamp's famous  _L.H.O.O.Q. _ One occasionally sees MD referred to as  M2_D2_ because of a prevailing belief that the institution's  "secret" name is Marcel Duchamp's Municipal Dump.
 *name bank*:  (n) 1.  a repository for generating, distributing,  and storing public and private keys for data encryption 2. a  registry for digital signatures.  As money became fully  electronic at the turn of the century, banks took over the  business of security for their customers' digital signatures.   Eventually, due in part to the proliferation of competing public-
 key encryption schemes, Congress moved to restrict name  banks to three:  one for government transactions, one for  business transactions, and one for personal transactions.  Most  people have keys in at least two of the three banks. (See also:   _Federal Name Repository._)
 *no-interrupt*:  (n, a)  used to signal that a data transmission  will go through as requested; compare _interrupt_.
 *picon*:  (n)  short for *p*ersonal *icon*, a picon is a graphical  or other data-generated stand-in for an individual, much used in  place of names, signatures, and/or photos on vidphones, nets,  and elsewhere.  Picons can be protected under trademark law  only if they are registered in the National Picon Database, in  order to avoid multiple instances of the same picon.  However,  they are not accepted by the government or for legal purposes in  lieu of dogtags. (The corporate equivalent of a picon is a logo.)
 *p&t*:  (a)  also:  pnt.  short for *p*oint *&_ *t*ouch, p&t  refers to things that are tangible or real-world as opposed to  intangible (hyperspatial, cyberspatial, mental).  Generally used  as a shorthand for object-oriented; e.g., a _p&t publisher_ as  opposed to an _e-pub_.  Often used to imply that something is  old-fashioned, as in _his artwork is real p&t stuff_.
 *source*:  (v)  to source means to give credit to one's sources of  materials, especially those being substantially altered.  Sourcing  became a widespread norm even before the death of copyright  meant that one could source one's materials without fear of  being sued for copyright infringement.  Some people advocate  making sourcing a legal requirement, but because that would  obviously be unenforceable and because source data are often  unverifiable, this movement has never really gotten off the  ground.  Accurate sourcing is a point of pride for most artists,  and since source lists (or genealogies) can become quite long  and complex, a number of ingenious ways of either hiding them  or displaying them have been developed. (See: genealogy,  transparency._)
 *source hunt*:  (n, v) an attempt to recover hidden source  information in a data file.  Source hunting became popular  among puzzle enthusiasts and was a precursor of the now more  generally popular _fortune hunt._  Many filemakers, especially  artists, offer prizes to source hunters to spur general interest in  their work.  *Tertian*:  (n, a)  originally:  Orbis Tertian.  Tertians are  members of Orbis Tertius, an unusual _clan_ linked by the  common project of realizing a special edition of the  _Encyclopedia Britannica_ mentioned in Jorge Luis Borges's  short story "Tlšn, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius." In Borges's story, a  certain edition of the Britannica contains extra entries that refer  to another world, intriguing details of which are given in the  story.  Orbis Tertius was founded by a group of writers  specifically to alter the _Britannica_ in conformity with  Borges's story, and the Tertians subsequently continued to  extend the fiction at great length.  It was a court case arising out  of the activities of the Tertians that led to the final extinction of  copyright law when the _Britannica's_ publishers lost their  attempt to bar the Tertians from altering the encyclopedia  without permission.  _Homebase_ editions of the Tertian  Encyclopedia are consistent bestsellers (subscribers are entitled  to get it updated on request).  *tilde* (*~*):  printer's mark, adopted for use to signify that  material is free of all restrictions on alteration, copying,  publication, etc., including the normal convention of _sourcing.
 *transparency*:  (n) a common form for source information to  be included in digital files, especially object-oriented image  files.  Transparencies are a layer of information included in a  file and assigned an object color of transparent (or background,  paper, etc.).  To recover them, one must know how to search for  invisible objects in such files, a procedure that varies from  application to application. (See also:  _dwarfing_, _source  hunt._)
 *wormfare*:  (n)  electronically based warfare, especially  attacks directed at the computer command and control  structures of other nations, as by net wildlife.
 *wormfood*:  (n)  any computer software or hardware that is  poorly protected against intrusion from worms, viruses, and  other net wildlife.  :File end

One of the interesting passages comes at the end of the DOJ memo

"These procedures do not create, and are not intended to create,
any substantive rights for individuals intercepted through
electronic surveillance, and noncompliance with these procedures
shall not provide the basis for any motion to suppress or other

What this means, apparently, is that keys or communications obtained

Not at the key-escrow phase, no. But you have to have a valid search

Here's the relevant language:

                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The reason that Reno doesn't just say "a court-ordered wiretap" is
that there are some emergency circumstances under which wiretap
authorization can be gotten in advance of approval by a neutral
magistrate. Both the Wiretap Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act make provisions for such emergencies. Eventually, such emergency wiretaps do have to be reviewed by a
magistrate, however. In the Wiretap Act, and, I believe, in FISA, the time limit is 48 hours.

Dear Friends on the Electronic Frontier,
Thank you for your efforts in fighting the government's ill-considered
Clipper proposal. We have already delivered over 2250 messages supporting
H.R. 3627 to Rep. Cantwell, and your messages have continued to flood in.
We'd now like to ask you to help us call for Congressional hearings on
Clipper by writing to Senator Patrick Leahy c/o leahy
As we have previously reported, the Clinton Administration has announced
that it plans to proceed on every front to make the Clipper Chip
encryption scheme a national standard and to discourage the development
and sale of alternative powerful encryption technologies. If the
government succeeds in this effort, the resulting blow to individual
freedom and privacy could be immeasurable.
So far, the government has resisted requests that it explain its policy.
When the Presidential Decision Directive calling for Clipper deployment
first appeared last spring, the Administration promised a report that
re-evaluated cryptography and privacy policy in light of technological
changes, the coming of the National Information Infrastructure, and the
end of the Cold War. The Administration also made a commitment to
meaningful public dialog before taking any major action on escrow
deployment or new legislation.
Yet in spite of the efforts of EFF, CPSR, ACLU, and other groups to
provide extensive input to the Administration, the promised policy report
never arrived, and the Administration has now said there will be no report
after all. This failure of public accountability makes Congressional
hearings an absolute necessity.
There are individuals in Congress willing to look into the Clipper
proposal and related policies--if they hear from you. Senator Patrick
Leahy (D-Vermont), who chairs one of the key committees responsible for
these issues, has asked for comments and concerns about the viability of
the Clipper initiative.
Here's where we need your help. *Please write Senator Leahy at
        leahy
and ask that the Senate hold hearings about Clipper.* Senate hearings may
be the only means of ensuring public feedback about Clipper, and, just as
important, they may be the only means of forcing the Administration to
explain its Clipper policy. Please express your concerns about the United
States' Clipper policy and cryptographic policy in general. Your letters
in support of hearings will be printed out and delivered to the senator.
And if you haven't written Rep. Maria Cantwell to show your support for
H.R. 3627, her bill to relax export restrictions on encryption technology,
now's the time to do so. Just send e-mail to         cantwell
and put "I support H.R. 3627" in your Subject header. Letters in support
of the bill will be printed out and delivered to Rep. Cantwell.
Our fight to keep national encryption policy out in the open--and to
continue allowing individuals to use encryption to ensure their own
privacy--has only just begun. In the coming weeks and months, we will be
working to give you more ways to make your voice heard on these vital
public issues.

Section-by-section Analysis of the 1994 draft
of the Digital Telephony legislation
Mike Godwin
The "other purposes" are, apparently, the correction of a drafting error
in ECPA that led to an anomaly in 18 USC 2511. See Section 4 below.
SECTION 2
Chapter 119 is the communications-interception chapter, commonly called
"Title III."
Chapter 206 is the pen-register/trap-and-trace chapter.
Title 50 includes interception provisions of the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act.
Note that Chapter 121 of Title 18, the stored-communications chapter of
the U.S. criminal code, is not mentioned. It may, however, be affected by
some of the amendments suggested in the Digital Telephony bill. This is essentially a deceptive statement about the effect of the Act.
Although 18 USC 2518(4) allows applicants for authorization orders to
request that the order "direct that a provider of wire or electronic
communication service ... furnish the applicant forthwith with all
information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish
the interception...", this provision has not widely been interpreted to
hold that service providers must actively create solutions to interception
problems if those solutions do not already exist. The FBI analysis says
government agencies "have been reluctant to pursue contempt or other legal
remedies to resolve this issue." The reason for this reluctance, in my
opinion, is that the language of 2518(4) does not unequivocally impose
such a burden on providers, and the government stands a good chance of
losing any fight in which it claims that such a burden does exist.
Thus, the FBI's solution is to create a *new* and *routine* obligation on
common carriers (but not small-scale providers) to generate technical
solutions to interception and "call setup" problems created by current
common-carrier networks. Moreover, this Act would require that common
carriers make manpower available on a 24-hour basis to handle
interceptions and the capture of call-setup information in the event of a
wiretap or pen-register/trap-and-trace order.
The FBI analysis asserts without quantification that "since the mid-1980s,
technological impediments have frustrated, in whole or in part, the
execution of a number of court orders." But among the "technological
impediments," apparently, has been the reluctance or inability of common
carriers to provide the kind of assistance that law
enforcement--specifically, guaranteed ability to capture communications
contents and "call setup" information.
The Act and the FBI analysis consistently use the language of
"clarification" in reference to the amendments contained in the Act, but
of course the vastly expanded authority of the Attorney General and the
FCC to supervise and punish common carriers is nothing if not "expanded
authority." This Act also creates many new legal obligations for common
carriers, "support services," and telecom equipment manufacturers.
These are all addressed in Section 4 of the Act. This section corrects
four anomalies under the current statutes: 1) It brings cordless telephones under the protection of Title III.
2) With respect to radio communications it creates Title III protection
for "an electronic communication" that is transmitted via radio.
3) It corrects an apparent omission by adding radio communications that
use "modulation techniques" for privacy to the interception penalty
provisions of 18 USC 2511(4).
4) It corrects a drafting error in ECPA by adding "electronic
communication" to a clause in 18 USC 2511 (2)(a)(i).
Note that Chapter 109 is not part of Title III; instead, it's a chapter
including various penalty provisions for interference in the execution of
lawful searches and seizures and for violating the Constitutionally
mandated requirements for such procedures. The chapter is does not amount
to a statutory scheme--it's basically a collection of somewhat related
individual search-and-seizure statutes.
Why isn't this Act part of Title III? Perhaps because it uses a different
definition of "intercept" than is used in the wiretap statute. See
discussion below.
This Section of the Act outlines and specifies just what the government
wants the phrase "information, facilities, technical assistance" in 18 USC
2518 to mean. Note that a major component of these obligations is the
requirement that common carriers *create* new information and facilities
and devise new means of technical assistance.
The FBI analysis makes clear that the drafters of this Act developed a
wish list in consultation with other  federal, state, and local
law-enforcement agencies. Although the FBI analysis states that "The
Government intentionally eschewed setting any technical standards because
it does not desire to 'dictate' particular technological solutions, it is
apparent that the government hopes to gain the authority to dictate
*functional* solutions. Given the penalties for noncompliance and other
enforcement powers this Act creates, "dictate" is not too strong a verb
for the kind of prerogative the government is seeking.
Note that in this iteration of the Act, there is a new emphasis on "call
setup information," which is, basically, origination and destination
information for wire or electronic communications. It has been claimed by
law enforcement that such current features as call forwarding often thwart
their ability to implement wiretaps, pen registers, or traps and traces.
This Act, if passed, would require common carriers to redesign calling
features if necessary to be ble to provide "call setup" information, or,
in the alternative, to cease providing calling features that thwarted the
capture of such transactional information.
It is unclear how such a requirement would play out in cases where
communications are transmitted using both common carriage networks and
enhanced service providers. On its face, the statute may require that a
common carrier be able, for example,  to tell not only which subscriber is
sending e-mail over the phone lines to the CompuServe Packet Network, but
also where that e-mail's ultimate destination is.
The FBI analysis stresses that common carriers can perform a capacity
analysis, based on their prior records of assisted intercepts, etc., to
determine how much wiretap capacity to provide in order to minimize the
costs of compliance.   The FBI claims that "a number of court orders and
authorizations were not fully executed, or were not even sought" because
of "capacity shortfalls, such as insufficient 'port' capacity in the
cellular mobile switching offices." The FBI analysis states that "at any
particular time, a number of Federal, state, and local government agencies
may be competing" for capacity, and that "it is critical that there be
sufficient capacity to accommodate completely the concomitant needs of all
government agencies."
This section requires that common carriers, including cellular and any
other mobile-phone service, be able to single out individual
communications and capture both contents and call-setup information, that
they be able to do this "live," or else immediately after the
transmission, with a preference for the former. This is the meaning of
The FBI analysis justifies this requirement in terms of "minimization" of
intrusion on the communications of innocent parties; of course, the
requirement would enhance the efficiency and speed with which the
government could effect a wiretap.
No strange clicking on the line, in other words.
Not only must communications and call-setup info be captured "live" or
immediately post-transmission, but it also must be routable  to a remote,
designated government-operated location. Whether the routing is done by
the carrier or the government is unclear.
The exceptions to this "routability requirement" occur when a criminal or
intelligence emergency pre-empts the normal process of seeking an order,
or when there is an attempt by the person committing an offense to thwart
interception by changing facilities. These types of situations are
provided for under current law.
The FBI analysis justifies this "drafting" of personnel as a way of
mollifying common carriers who don't want non-personnel handling their
equipment or operating their facilities. Of course, this section also
means that a common carrier must budget for such personnel to be at the
service of law enforcement for on-premises intercepts and call-setup
The time limit for compliance has not changed since the last iteration of
the Act.
Note that only large-scale communications providers are included in the
scope of this version of the Act. The FBI analysis states that PBXs,
computer-network providers, and other entities that do not qualify as
common carriers are not to be obligated by the passage of this act to add
these new capabilities, but will be obligated to cooperate under the
general provisions of 18 USC 2518(4) to the extent possible. *Note
especially that this distinction undercuts the claim that the government
is merely "clarifying" a pre-existing obligation under 18 USC 2518(4)--if
that were true, these clarifications would apply to *all* "providers of
wire or electronic communications services" and not just "common
This section imposes an obligation on common carriers to instruct support
services and equipment providers that they need "wiretap-friendly"
services and equipment, and it imposes an obligation on the service and
equipment providers to comply.
Note that the statute does not itself outline remedies for noncompliance
by support services and equipment providers. The FBI analysis, however,
states that the Attorney General "may apply for an order, such as a writ
of mandamus" mandating the compliance of such entities.
The "may apply" language implies that this is not an exhaustive list of
the remedies available to the Attorney General, who is granted general
"authority to enforce."
In the first version of this Act, enforcement authority was to be given to
the FCC; in the second version, enforcement was the responsibility of the
Attorney General and the DOJ.  This section apparently combines the best
of both worlds, empowering either the FCC or the AG to enforce the Act's
Essentially, this section allows non-compliant common carriers to be
challenged on two fronts.
This language apparently is merely precatory; apparently, the Attorney
General need not consult with the FCC or the other entities mentioned
We may reasonably anticipate that there would be significant litigation on
the issue of remuneration for "reasonable costs."
Normally, "intercept" means capture the contents of a communication. 18
USC 2510(4).  But the government here is exempting common carriers from
providing the plaintext versions of encrypted communications that were
encrypted be the subscriber through some method other than an encryption
service offered by the common carrier and to which the carrier retains the
encryption keys or some equivalent capability to decrypt the
Interestingly, this definition seems to gut the meaning of the definition
in 18 USC 2510(4), which focuses only on the content of the communication.
"Interception" legally means "capturing the content" in Title III. If
you're not capturing the content, it's not, strictly speaking, an
interception according the statutory definition.
The FBI analysis states that law enforcement's preference is for such
information to be captured *before* transmission.
This provision would create an immensely powerful tool for message traffic
analysis, which has significance wholly independent of the ability to
capture the content of communications.
The government's prerogative to capture such transactional information is
conditioned on a much lower standard of proof than that for
wiretaps--rather than making a showing of probable cause, the government
need only "certify" to the issuing magistrate that "the information likely
to be obtained by such installation and use is relevant to an ongoing
criminal investigation." 18 USC 3123.
This simply makes clear that the prerogative to require these new services
from common carriers extends to all levels of law enforcement, and not
just to the federal law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. In the early days of cordless telephones, it was easy for the radio
transmissions between handsets and base units to be intercepted by
scanners and, occasionally, by ordinary transistor radios. Congress did
not want to felonize such trivially easy interceptions. Current cordless
phone technology, however, makes such interceptions more difficult,
according to the FBI analysis, and therefore it makes sense to extend
wiretap protections to cordless phones.
Note that this would resolve a long-standing anomaly in the protections
offered by Title III.
This adds "electronic communications" (such as e-mail or data
communications) to the class of radio communications whose privacy is
protected by Title III. The FBI analysis states that this amendment is
designed to make clear that data communications over radio are also
protected under Title III.
This amendment adds a penalty for modulation-protected communications,
which are already defined as not "readily accessible to the general
public" under the current language of 18 USC 2510(16)(B).
This simply corrects a drafting error left over from the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act, by adding the term "electronic communications"
to those communications that a provider can intercept or disclose in the
course of protecting its service. The amended section already included the
language "provider of wire or electronic communications service," but
seemed to allow only the interception and disclosure of "wire

FBI, Justice Seek High-Tech Surveillance Guarantees
by John Mintz and John Schwartz
Washington Post Staff Writers
The FBI and the Justice Department are fearful that increasing
sophistication in communications technology will keep investigators from
tapping phones and computers and are seeking legislative guarantees that
wiretaps will continue to be technically possible.
The Bush administration proposed a similar bill in 1992, but withdrew it
after industry officials and civil libertarians bitterly denounced it. Although the Clinton administration's new version differs in some ways from
the old one, opponents said it too is flawed.
Administration officials will outline their proposal today at the White
House for communications executives.
"We see this bill as a potential blueprint for an electronic surveillance
society," said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation and spokesman for a coalition of civil-liberties groups and
high-technology firms.
FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said in a speech last week that the new
technologies and a "lack of support" by some communications executives mean
"the country will be unable to protect itself against terrorism, violent
crime, foreign threats, drug trafficking, espionage" and other crimes.
Berman said that designing peepholes into the nation's rapidly expanding
information infrastructure will do far more than guarantee law enforcement
agencies the ability to tap phones.
As more and more activities of everyday life go "on-line" -- from home
banking to video-on-demand selections -- the initiative would provide
snoopers with a profile of how citizens live, work and play, he said.
The new bill would give the attorney general broad power to demand that
communications gear be designed to guarantee that investigators would have
access to it, and sets stiff penalties for firms that don't comply.
The bill would allow the attorney general to seek fines of $10,000 a day
for firms that don't provide access or, in some cases, to shut them down. A copy of the bill and the administration's analysis have been obtained by
The Washington Post.
Industry executives voiced concern that redesigning U.S. communications
networks to accommodate the proposed legislation would cost more than the
FBI's $300 million estimate.  Under the FBI plan, taxpayers, not telephone
ratepayers, would foot the bill.
The FBI and the Justice Department say the initiative would not expand
their power, but would ensure access to the type of communications they
have been entitled to tap for years.
Administration officials say such authority was granted in 1970 amendments
to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.  But the
communications industry at that time consisted mostly of AT&T.  Not only
has technology become more complex, but a host of new players have entered
the field, including the "Baby Bell" regional phone companies, cable firms,
computer companies and more.
The FBI is concerned about a host of new phone services, including "call
forwarding," under which calls are bounced from phone to phone and, in
turn, defeat investigators searching for a call's final destination.
Moreover, the FBI says many cellular phone systems provide only limited
"ports," or entryways, for tapping.  In the mid-1980s, New York City's
cellular system provided only five "ports" for tapping, meaning
investigators often waited in line.
The new bill dropped a requirement in the 1992 proposal that would have
insisted that corporate switchboards accommodate wiretaps.
The new bill applies mainly to "common carriers."  That term usually refers
to phone firms or transportation companies, but in this bill could be
interpreted to include cable firms and others.  Computer and
telecommunications equipment firms also would be required to provide access
for investigators.
The bill would require phone firms, on law enforcement's request, to
provide up-to-the-second records on every call to and from any phone.  The
new bill would allow investigators to gather the information more quickly
than ever before, and from their offices.  Under current law and under the
new bill, investigators can obtain such data relatively easily -- by
persuading a judge that it's "relevant" to an ongoing criminal probe.
Philip Servidea, government affairs director for AT&T, said the company has
long believed a new law is unnecessary.  "The legislation will have to have
come a long sight from the last version to be acceptable," he said.
"This makes the development of the communications industry a law
enforcement matter," said Janlori Goldman, a privacy expert at the American
Civil Liberties Union.  "We're very concerned."
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said that while he looks forward to working
with Freeh to update wiretap laws, giving the government "final say in how
far and how fast technology advances" could "jeopardize the legitimate
concerns of business."

A Chip Over My Shoulder:
 The Problems With Clipper
 Column for July 1994 issue of Internet World
 By Mike Godwin
 "Only in a police state is the job of a policeman easy."
 --Orson Welles  Your government is deeply troubled by the possibility that you can keep a
 secret.
 Or, to put it more precisely, the government is disturbed by the prospect
 of widespread powerful encryption tools in individual hands. Once you can
 keep your communications and data truly secret, officials worry, the value
 of wiretapping, an important law-enforcement and intelligence tool, will
 evaporate.
 It's unclear whether the government's arguments are valid. But regardless
 of whether they are, the government's latest efforts to prevent us from
 adopting powerful and uncrackable encryption technologies raise serious
 questions about personal liberty, the role of government, and the
 possibility of privacy in the 21st century.
 If you're not already familiar with these efforts, here's an update. The
 Clinton Administration has embarked on an ambitious plan to prevent a mass
 market for uncrackable encryption from arising. The first step in this
 plan has already been announced:  the Administration has called for the
 entire federal government to adopt the Clipper Chip--an encryption
 standard with a "back door"--for communications and data security.  In
 addition, the government has declared its intention to use every legal
 method short of outright prohibition to discourage alternative forms of
 encryption technology.
 "Just what is this Clipper Chip?" you may be wondering. The short answer
 is: the chip is an encryption device, developed to National Security
 Agency specs, that keeps your communications and data secret from everyone
 ... except the government.  To understand how the chip works, you need to look at what officials call
 its  "key escrow encryption method." Manufactured by a private company
 called Mykotronix, the chip uses an NSA-developed algorithm called
 "Skipjack, " which, by all accounts so far, is a remarkably powerful
 algorithm. But the chip also includes the "feature" that its primary
 encryption key can be divided up mathematically into two "partial keys."
 The government proposes that each partial key be held by a separate
 government agency--the Administration has picked the Department of the
 Treasury and the National Institute of Standards and Technology
 (NIST)--from which the keys can be retrieved when government officials
 obtain a wiretap order.  The NSA and the FBI love this idea. With the Clipper Chip in your phone or
 computer, they believe, you have the power to keep your information
 private from crooks and industrial spies and anyone else who wants to
 pry--except of course for law enforcement and the NSA. Law enforcement and
 intelligence agencies would be barred from seeking those escrowed keys in
 the absence of legal authorization, normally a court order. "And of course
 you needn't worry about us," say government officials. "We're here to
 protect you."
 	Chips Off the New Block
 The current initiative has been a long time coming. It was in April of
 last year the Clinton Administration first announced Clipper--the
 announcement was met with a public outcry from civil-liberties and
 industry groups. Civil libertarians were concerned about the government's
 insistence on its need to prevent citizens from having access to truly
 unbreachable privacy technologies. Computer and telecom industry leaders
 worried about a standard that might crush a potentially vital market in
 such technologies.
 At first the Administration expressed a willingness to listen. The Digital
 Privacy and Security Working Group, a coalition of industry and
 public-interest organizations headed by the Electronic Frontier
 Foundation, outlined its objections and expressed the hope of engaging in
 talks with the Administration about the issue. In early February of this
 year, however, the Clinton Administration and various agencies announced
 to the world that, in spite of the grave misgivings of civil-liberties and
 industry groups, it would be proposing the Clipper Chip's encryption
 scheme as a new Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). The
 standard, stresses the government, will be entirely "voluntary"--but the
 government plans to use export-control laws and other methods to frustrate
 the market for any competitive form of encryption technology.
 Current export-control laws restrict the sales in foreign controls of
 encryption hardware and software. The laws have not been entirely
 effective in keeping commercial encryption technologies out of foreign
 hands--it's possible these days to buy encryption products in Moscow, for
 example. But the laws do succeed in deterring the American software
 industry from developing powerful and easy-to-use encryption products,
 since any company that does so is denied the right to sell the product on
 the global market.
 Still, if Clipper is voluntary, you may ask, what does it matter to
 *individuals *what standard the government adopts? The government also
 adopted the ADA programming language, after all, yet there are still
 people programming in all sorts of languages, from BASIC to C++. The
 answer is simple--"freedom of choice" is meaningful only if there are real
 choices. The government's export-control strategy is designed to make sure
 that there aren't any choices. If commercial software companies aren't
 allowed to sell encryption to the world market, they're unlikely to
 develop strong, easy-to-use alternatives to Clipper. And that means
 individuals won't have access to alternatives.
 Now, it's perfectly possible, in theory, to thwart the government-approved
 Clipper scheme by using a non-commercial encryption application, such as
 PGP, to pre-encrypt your messages before sending them through
 Clipper-equipped devices. But PGP and other products, because of their
 slowness or difficulty, are never likely to expand beyond the circle of
 hobbyists that enthusiastically support them. For encryption products to
 give rise to a genuine consumer market, they have to be quick and almost
 transparently easy to use.  The government knows this, which is why their focus is on nipping
 (clipping?) the commercial encryption software market in the bud. It's the
 commercial market that really matters.
 	The government's side
 When asked to substantiate the need for Clipper, or the threat of
 unbreakable encryption, the government often talks about crime prevention.
 As a practical matter, however, wiretaps are almost always used *after*
 crimes are committed--to gather evidence about the individuals the
 government already suspects to have been involved in a crime. So, the
 hypothetical cases involving nuclear terrorism or murder-kidnappings
 aren't really convincing--it's the rare case in which a wiretap prevents a
 crime from occurring. As a practical matter, the single most important
 asset to law enforcement is not wiretaps but informants. And nothing about
 unbreakable encryption poses the risk that informants are going to
 disappear.
 One of the more rational statements of the government's case for Clipper
 comes from my friend Trotter Hardy, a law professor at William and Mary,
 "The government's argument, I take it, is that the benefit is law
 enforcement.  That strikes me as at least as great a benefit as minimum
 wage laws; perhaps more, since it protects everybody (at least in theory),
 whereas [minimum] wage laws primarily benefit their recipients.  Maybe EPA
 regs are the better analogy: everybody gets reduced pollution; with
 Clipper, everybody gets reduced criminal activity.  Is that not a
 reasonable trade-off?"
 But the problem is that the government refuses to be forthcoming as to
 what  kind of trade-off we're talking about. According to government
 statistics, there are fewer than 1000 state and federal law-enforcement
 wiretaps per year, and only of a minority of these wiretaps leads to
 convictions. Yet we are being asked to abandon the chance for true privacy
 and to risk billions of dollars in trade  losses when there has never been
 shown to be any crime associated with  uncrackable encryption whatsoever.
 And we're also being asked to believe that the kind of criminals who are
 smart enough to use encryption are dumb enough to choose the one kind of
 encryption that the government is guaranteed to be able to crack.
 Moreover, there are fundamental political issues at stake. This country
 was founded on a principle of restraints on government. A system in which
 the privacy of our communications is contingent on the good faith of the
 government, which holds all the encryption keys, flies in the face of what
 we have been taught to believe about the structure of government and the
 importance of individual liberty.
 In short, the government fails to make its case in two separate
 ways--pragmatically and philosophically.
 Trotter goes on to write:  ".... I don't think the government cares whether an accountant in India
 can password protect a  spreadsheet.  I would guess that even Clipper or
 DES [the government's current Digital Encryption Standard] or whatever
 would be more than enough protection for such a person. I think the
 government cares that it be able to detect foreign intelligence that is
 relevant to US security or interests. I am not sure where I come out on
 the question, but at the very least it seems to me that the government is
 reasonable in this desire."
 Yet there are some premises here that need to be questioned. Do we really
 suppose that "foreign intelligence" is dependent on the American software
 industry to develop its encryption tools? Diffie-Helman public-key
 encryption and DES are already available worldwide, yet  Microsoft can't
 export software that contains either form of encryption.
 No, the real issue is that, to the extent that a mass market arises for
 encryption products, it makes the NSA's job more difficult, and it may  at
 some future time make some investigations more difficult as well.
 When asked to quantify the problem, however, the government invariably
 begs off.  Instead, government spokespeople say, "Well, how would you feel
 if there were a  murder-kidnapping that we couldn't solve because of
 encryption?" To which  my answer is, "Well, I'd feel about the same way
 that I'd feel if there  were a murder-kidnapping that couldn't be solved
 because of the privilege  against self-incrimination."
 Which is to say, I understand that limits on government power entail  a
 loss in efficiency of law-enforcement investigations and
 intelligence-agency operations. Nevertheless, there is a fundamental
 choice we have to make about what kind of society we want to live in.
 Open societies, and societies that allow individual privacy, are  *less
 safe*. But we have been taught to value liberty more highly  than safety,
 and I think that's a lesson well-learned.
 What's more, we need to be able to engage in rational risk assessment, and
 that's  something that the government resists. Instead, the government
 subscribes to  the reasoning of Pascal's Wager. Pascal, you may recall,
 argued that the  rational man is a Christian, even if the chances that
 Christianity is true  are small. His reasoning is quasi-mathematical--even
 if the chances of  Christianity's truth are small, the consequences of
 choosing not to  be a Christian are (if that choice is incorrect)
 infinitely terrible.  Eternal torment, demons, flames, the whole works.
 This is precisely the way that the government talks about nuclear
 terrorism and murder-kidnappings. When asked what the probability is  of
 a) a nuclear terrorist, who b) decides to use encryption, and c)  manages
 otherwise to thwart counterterrorist efforts, they'll answer  "What does
 it matter what the probability is? Even one case is too  much to risk!"  But we can't live in a society that defines its approach to civil
 liberties  in terms of infinitely bad but low-probability events. Open
 societies are risky. Individual freedom and privacy are risky. If we are
 to make a  mature commitment to an open society, we have to acknowledge
 those risks  up front, and reaffirm our willingness to endure them.
 We face a choice now. After a century of technological development that
 has eroded our ability to keep our personal lives private, we finally
 possess, thanks to cheap computing power and advances in cryptography, the
 ability to take privacy into our own hands and make our own decisions
 about how much, and how well, to protect it.  This prospect is frightening to a government that has come to rely on its
 ability to reach into our private lives when it sees the need to do so.
 But I have faith that our society is not dependent on our government's
 right to mandate disclosure of our personal records and private
 communications--that a mature society can tolerate a large degree of
 personal privacy and autonomy.  It's a faith I hope you share.

Here's why I'm asking.  The relevant statute is 35 USC 271(g):
 "Whoever without authority imports into the United States or sells or uses
 within the United States a product which is made by a process patented in
 the United States shall be liable as an infringer, if the importation, sale,
 or use of the product occurs during the term of such process patent. In an
 action for infringement of a process patent, no remedy may be granted for
 infringement on account of the noncommercial use or retail sale of a product
 unless there is no adequate remedy under this title for infringement on
 account of the importation or other use or sale of that product. A product
 which is made by a patented process will, for purposes of this title, not be
 considered to be so made after--
        1) it is materially changed by subsequent processes; or
        2) it becomes a trivial and nonessential component of another
 product."
I've got a guy who's telling me that PGP-encrypted communications sent
into the U.S.A. from abroad can be stopped at the border as infringing
"products," pursuant to this statute.
It's relevant to the argument whether RSA claims to hold process patents
or product patents.
The definitions of "product" and "import" are also relevant.

: Is the latter not in place yet?
Yes, you can use the DSS (unless it is given away to PK partners, that is).
The importance of using PGP or another strong privately developed crypto
is that it supports the industry rather than relies upon the government.
But since Mr Godwin has answered the question to his satisfaction and is not
responding to further questions, I guess we will never know the real reason
why the EFF will not use PGP to digitally sign press releases.
Apparently Mr Godwin chooses not to be responsive to the EFF membership with
respect to this issue. He only has said that sysops don't use PGP so rumors
would not be quashed anyway. From a person of his intelligence this is about the lamest reason I've heard.
Let me see if I can speculate on the real reaons the EFF may not choose to use PGP to sign press releases:
(0) Using PGP would be provocative to the very powers we seek to infiltrate
[ViaCrypt PGP is perfectly legal and fully licensed.]
(1) There is not a problem with authenticity.
[This must be false, otherwise Mr Godwin wouldn't have begun this thread]
(2) Signing with PGP is not effective.
[false; MD5 and RSA have no known weaknesses]
(3) Signing with PGP is too hard or would take too much time
[false, perfect for irregular press releases]
(4) PGP signatures take too much bandwidth.
[false, again perfect for the mmoderate to longer press releases]
(5) Sysops don't use PGP, rumors would spread anyway
[Sysops might begin with suitable leadership; the signature of course
could be ignored and the rumor spread anyway -- but if there *were*
a question of authenticity an individual could check the authenticity
without needing to log on to EFF's server or needing to personally contact an EFF official]
(6) Signatures make the press release harder to read
[false, a single line at the beginning and a block of lines at the end
are added, none of the body is changed in any way]
(7) We are journalists and attorneys, not nose-picking nerds
(8) We are journalists and attorneys, this might expose up to greater
liability and less 'deniability'.
(9) We just defend these 'PGP' and 'BBS' people.  We don't actually
want to ASSOCIATE with them more than we have to.  Cooties. (10) The EFF does not have to explain its actions or inactions to anyone.
While Sternlight is merely annoying, and sometimes entertaining, EFFs
lack of dialogue on this leadership opportunity supporting private
crypto signatures is very, very disappointing.

I respectfully disagree.. This may change in the future, of course.
What surely would have happened is that few people would have bothered to
check the signature, and those who did might try to counter the rumors,
but I'd still get calls from people who want to know *directly from me*
that it's a hoax (in other words, they wouldn't credit the claims of those
who checked the signature). Net result--no difference in time and effort
on my part.
Now, don't get me wrong--use of crypto is a good thing, and should be
encouraged, and we may eventually standardize on its use within EFF.
But the claim that this would have prevented the hoax is insupportable. Maybe in the future crypto society, but not now.
It is important to uncouple the argument that EFF should use crypto
from the argument that if we had used it, the problem we saw here would
not occur.
The specific argument that Grady Ward used to savage me and EFF is based
on the claim that we should have used PGP *specifically*.
As a matter of pure aesthetics, I prefer other things in my .signature.
There is even less poetry on the Net than there is cryptography.
