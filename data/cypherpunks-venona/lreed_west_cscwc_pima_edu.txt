[Author's Note: This chapter, or continuation of the prologue,
 or whatever the fuck it is, contains an expose of the true
 diabolical nature of Lucky Green.
 Unfortunately, the only existing file-copy and printout are
 at the residence of a friend who is not currently at home,
 and it seems to be in my best interest to leave town in a
 hurry, without turning on my headlights and using only
 back roads and alleys.
 Anyone who is just so desperate to read Prologue 2/0 that
 they are peeing thier pants might want to email Jay Tolkoff
 at whatever internet address appears on Prologue 1/0 that
 was recently spammed to the CypherPunks list, pleading,  bribing, threatening or thanking him, in order to see if
 he might possibly be open to sending you (or the list) a
 copy of foresaid missive.
 At present, continuation of "Space Aliens Hide My Drugs"
 seems to be largely dependent upon the speed of my vehicle
 and the volume of my ammo supply. (The more things change,
 the more they remain insane.)
 And the good news is...
 As soon as I hit 'send', Baby and I will be hitting the
 road, under cover of darkness, with the sounds of Linda
 Lou and the Drifters belting out Leadbelly's "When I Was
 A Cowboy" in our wake.
 Don't get any on'ya...]

SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY DRUGS !!!???!!! / Prologue 2/0
If This Is Sunday, I must be Toto:
[Was: Oh, what a Lucky man he Was:]
  It was only the third CypherPunks physical meeting I had attended and, as usual I spent the whole time watching from a distance, this time with Bianca watching me from a distance, to see who was watching me from a distance.
  The cellular rang.
  "Toto?"
  "Yes..."
  "You must be TruthMonger, today, because CJ just told Lucky Green that *he* is Toto."
  "OK. I guess it must be because he's so used to being Toto on the weekends, when he has to be back in the Home on Monday morning."
  "Bye."
  "Bye, dear." I hung up the phone.
  CJ doesn't get out a lot (pun intended).
  Normally, Bianca and I would have objected to him attending a CypherPunks physical meeting, but, since most of us have gone to ground recently, we thought there would be little danger in finding out what reaction his presence would elicit in certain individuals known to have so little sense as to be willing to be publically associated with Radical Anarchists who are too old and wise to merely be pretentious poseurs, and who actually have the knowledge, skills and experience to pose a serious threat to NWO plans to bring the Brave New Digital World into a state of CyberStatism.
  Thus, after clothing him in a manner that would make it obvious to anyone nervous about his appearance and demeanor that he was not likely to be carrying any concealed weapons of mass destruction, we ascertained that he had already 'gone potty' and sent him off to the C2Net offices in Oakland to act as our WeatherMan and ascertain which direction John Gilmore, et al, were blowing.
  Those who know CJ Parker only as a person who, after years of working in some of the most technologically advanced areas of the computer industry, still refers to a hard drive as "...the whatchamacallit...you know, the thing that spins around inside and you keep all of your information on it..." often fail to understand his usefulness to us a fount of information in regard to the subtle nuances that most people fail to pick up on in the busy madness of daily activity and social interaction.
  Although superficially inept and ill-equipped for life as we know it, those capable of seeing beyond the Veil of Maya recognize that, although he may be incapable of brain-registering whether or not the woman he has loved and lived with for a quarter of a century wears glasses, he has the ability to read the soul and psyche of those whom he only meets in passing, on the highways, byways, sidestreets and alleys of life.
  I originally thought that he was a totally useless conduit for information which needed to be gleaned in a reconnaisance mission type of manner.   It was one of Bianca's pre-teen computer neophytes who explained to me, "It's no use asking him any questions. If you ask him to estimate the numbers of at a meeting that thirty people attended, you will get an answer ranging between five and a hundred. If you want to find out things that even God doesn't know, you just have to make a statement that points to something which is likely to be totally untrue. He's the TruthMonger, you know."
  For some strange reason, children seem to have little trouble instinctively understanding the things that CJ discusses, even if they seem to be random, insane blatherings dealing with things far beyond the knowledge and experience one would expect a child to have had contact with thus far in life.
  "I bet everyone at the CypherPunks meeting was wearing blue socks." I told CJ after we met back in Berkeley at his sister's house.
  "No," he replied, "there was a lady wearing interesting jeans, who used to be the lover, or something, of one of the men there, and seemed to be temporarily in need of a lot of intellectual/emotional reassurance about her value and competency because of spending so many years of being a female with a brain in a penis-dominated   I now know CJ well enough that I realized that I had only to make one more false assumption, even though it was perfectly logical, in order to elicit a mountain of information about what took place, even though it was unlikely that he remembered, even vaguely, what the meeting had been about, from a normal point of view.
  "She spent a lot of time discussing various things with him?" I   "No." CJ replied, looking at me like I had just fallen off the turnip truck and had no idea how life really worked. "She barely paid any attention to him, and only spoke a few words to him at the end of the meeting."
  Moving right along, as if this statement clarified the foundation upon which he was basing this information, he proceeded to give us a full account of the meeting. An account which we knew would be totally accurate, once we had sifted out the parts which existed only in his own mind, since they would have made the experience so much more interesting and full of 'joi de vivre' if they *had* actually happened. (e.g. "...and every time Greg Broiles left the room, they would stop whatever they were discussing, and tell lawyer jokes until he got back. They've obviously been doing that for years, and he's never suspected.")
Random Excerpts From the ClueServer With One 512K Memory Bank:
  "I got to tell Peter Trei that his stuff kicks butt!"
  "Lucky Green and Bill Stewart are wearing the opposite bodies in real life that they have in my mind from knowing them on the CypherPunks mailing list."
  "The broads were phenomenal. I always figured that it would not be a mistake to marry any of the women on the CypherPunks list, sight unseen, and I knew I was right just by looking at them.
  "Oh...and when they talked, it wasn't like it burst the bubble of some sort of fantasy, or something...they were still like that."   {This is the statement that had Bianca snortling and giggling so hard that she was drooling on herself and blowing foam out of her nostrils. Later, she commented, "That was an example of the types of things he would say when I first met him that convinced me what a boorish, chauvanistic asshole he was, until I would think about them later and realize how sensitive and romantic they were if you really thought about what he was saying.")
  "Sameer sure looked at me funny. I guess he might have thought I'd just knocked off Billy Gates, and that he was next on the list.
  "I kind of wondered why, until I realized that we never really say anything nice about him to balance out all the bad shit we lay on him in our Dark Forces conspiracy theories, so that the people who fuck with us are less likely to fuck with him.
  "Shit, he's the guy who is taking all of the stuff that the idealists and theorists in cryptoanarchy are talking about and spreading it out in the real world where money and product rule the roost of results.
  "Oh, Yeah! That reminds me...
  "The only time I talked was when Eric Hughes was talking about Linux and saying the same bullshit that we all listened to--and said ourselves--decades ago, about UNIX. You know, about how UNIX should be ruling the world, instead of DOS, only now it's Linux, instead of Windows. Except it wasn't bullshit, then or now, except that what Hughes was saying was as true as what we used to say, and there isn't time anymore to go through this shit more times until we get it right, so I knew I had to ask what would make it turn out different this time.
  "I couldn't resist stepping on a few corns to see who was cool and who wasn't so I phrased my question to throw a little praise in Micro$not's direction. I mentioned that UNIX failed to take the hill even back when DOS sucked, big-time, and asked how it would be possible to do so with Linux, now that BadBillyG had a product that was actually functional, and worked, for the most part.
  "I was kind of disappointed in the answers, although I realized later that the only comments that came out were the knee-jerk reactions of those who had spent years in the industry being tortured by having to work with, or live in the shadow of, a primitive M$ operating system designed to torture people who actually wanted to make computers do something useful.
  "Some of them were very quiet and went inside their heads when I asked my question. Probably because its the kind of question you have to ask and answer for yourself, usually when you're laying awake in bed at four in the morning.
  "Actually, though, Eric Hughes, before I asked it, or afterwards, I don't really know, gave what is probably the only real answer, although some of us said it way back when, probably even him, but maybe we all just need to understand why it is the real answer. He said that it was up to people such as those gathered in that room, that day, to write the programs and make the links to existing software, systems and protocols that would provide end-users with the tools that they needed for Linux to legitimately serve their needs.
  "He might have also said that we/they would need to be prepared to do it regardless of whether or not it had any immediate or long-term financial payoff/incentive for us/them, but even if he didn't, I heard that in what he said, and I'm sure most of the others did,   "Anyway, saying something nice about Micro$not in that room was as much fun as seeing the reaction at a wedding when you crap on the wedding cake."
  "I think I comported myself very well, even though it meant breaking my promise to my nephew to ask all of the CypherChicks whether or not they were wearing panties."
And In Case You Were Thinking About Filing the Preceding In The 'Humor' Directory:
   Anyone at that CypherPunks physical meeting who failed to think seriously about the question CJ posed, either at the time, or later, upon reflection, is either an idiot, or quite possibly just too young to have been through more than a single "War to end all wars."
  Bianca told me that Lucky Green had mentioned to CJ that he had read "The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre" and had made a comment to the effect that he didn't really understand what it was, or was supposed to be, about. She said that she suspected that the reason for this was along the lines of the current status of such works as "1984," "Animal Farm" and "Brave New World."
  "1984," for example, is no longer some futuristic tale of a dark and menacing fate which may someday befall all of society and mankind. Rather, it contains a plethora of evil scenarios which have not only come to pass, but which have been realized more completely and in a more technologically effecient manner that the author could possibly have conceived of.
  Having grown up in an era when many of these futuristic projections were already a fait accompli, or in the beginning stages of becoming so, I sometime would reflect on how the work would have affected those who had read it decades before, when it was originally written. What parts seemed as if they might be whisperingly prophetic? What parts seemed to be semi-real fantasies about what might occur if the whole world went to hell in a handbasket? What parts seemed to be totally ludicrous scenarios which were the product of an author with too much time on his hands, and an overactive imagination?
  Now I wonder how the Chainsaw Massacre is perceived by those whose experience of 'the way things are, and always have been' encompasses many of the things which TXCSM had portrayed as dark undercurrents swirling about in the vortex of a rapidly spinning new technology.
  Undoubtedly the answer to that question is as multi-faceted and as context-dependent as a question asking "Who are you?"
  When the son of gomez describes computers that know all, see all, and can spit out the names of the miscreants at the speed of light, in order to dispose of them before the battle for the souls of all mankind begins, it must assuredly be read and understood differently by one whose elders told them tales about the great battles they fought to win the 'equal rights' and 'anti-discrimination' battles of recent eras, than by one whose elders described to them the dark terror of living in fear of being discovered for not wearing the yellow star which signified that the identification papers they were required to present to those in authority should be checked against the list of those to be bundled in cattle-cars which reeked of oppression and death, separated from their loved ones and sent to far-away labor camps.
  The morning after CJ had spoken to Lucky, Bianca woke in the wee hours to find him lying in bed and thinking, not having slept all night. She quiety asked him what it was he was thinking about. I heard his reply from the next room.
  The words he spoke, in a soft and quietly accepting tone, sent shivers down my spine, and left me with much to contemplate as I lay awake for some time before drifting off back to sleep.
  "Lucky is a nice kid. He's got bounce in his step and a gleam in his eye. He's got the world by the tail and every reason to believe that doing what he loves and living life with high standards and moral certitude will lead to a future where light will rule over darkness, and children will have a reason to smile.
  "I hope he's right. I desperately hope that he's right."
  "I want him to live in a world where "WebWorld & The Mythical Circle of Eunuchs" isn't prophetic. Where it is just an interesting story about how life could have been if the whole world turned to   "I don't want him to live in a world where, in the end, he ends up saying, as in the Prologue to 'WebWorld'--'If only we had known...'"
  "What Eric Hughes said at the CypherPunks meeting made me feel like it was 'Deja vu, all over again.' as Yogi Berra used to say.
  "He could well have been Bubba Rom Dos, speaking at the original meeting of the Circle of Eunuchs, telling those gathered, 'It's up to you. *You* need to pick up the torch. *You* need to write the code--to do the groundwork and light the way for those who will come after you. *You* need to do it, not for fame, fortune, or profit, but simply because it is right, and because it needs doing.'"
  "Linux isn't going to win out because it's the best. And it's not even going to be the best unless those who know its value and its capabilities *make* it the best for those who will never know or understand it, but will only know whether or not it serves them and suits their needs.
  "And it's not just Linux. The same goes for all of the other tools and trappings of future technolgy--censorware, encryption, monitoring tools, anonymity, identity based data-gathering."
  "The masses will use what they are given, what works best for them. They will take the easiest road, for the most part, as we all do in matters which we cannot control for ourselves. The masses aren't crying out for filtering software which will allow their children only to access a limited and prejudicial view of the world they live in--they are using it because that is what is being made available."
  "The same idealistic computer cowboys and self-proclaimed elitest programming gurus who decry the fact that the 'sheeple' are not willing to become computer experts in order to make use of what is 'freely available' would be outraged if an airline company denied them a ticket because they didn't have a pilot's license, or didn't know from memory where all of the emergency exit doors are on a   "I shouldn't have been nice to Lucky. When he told me that he didn't understand 'The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre,' I should have grabbed him by the throat, thrown him against the wall, slapped him silly, and said, 'Read it again, you dumb bastard! It's about you. It's about John Gilmore, Tim May, Sandy Sandfort, Lynne Harrison, Hallam-Baker, and everyone else who is still wondering why the fuck we're spamming their mailing list with all of this semi-literate, mystical garbage about a mythical rag-tag band of lunatics striving to fight some nebulous battle between the Forces of Light and the Forces of Darkness.'
  "I should have told him, 'It's about the CypherPunks, you lame-witted dip-shit! "The True Story of the InterNet" was begun long before the CypherPunks even existed, because in order for the future of mankind to have any hope of all of surviving the next wave of technology with any of true life, liberty and freedom intact, individuals and groups like the CypherPunks *had* to come into    "TXCSM was an allegory for the hackers, crackers, phreaks and punks who would have to serve as the soldiers, troops and armies that would be willing to leave behind the comfort and security of their home and hearth, if need be, to defend CyberSpace from those who would use it to rule and conquer all of MeatSpace. It's about the lawyers and programmers and middle-managers who abhor the hackers, crackers, phreaks and punks, but who are working within the system to defend the same ideals and concepts, in their own way.
  "The heros from the beginning of time, to the dark days of the Third Reich, were'nt soldiers. They were men, women, and sometimes even children, who *became* soldiers of one ilk or another, in order to defend themselves, their families and neighbors, their fellow humans, from rulers and forces which were striving to bring all of humanity under their thumb.
  "The Nazi death camps weren't liberated by soldiers. They were liberated by the same kind of people who were imprisoned in them. Farmers from Moscow, carpenters from Omaha, accountants from France, or Sweden, or Austrailia. People with dark skin or light skin, people speaking a multitude of different languages, people who had been preparing for war from the moment the dark clouds began forming over Europe and people who thrust themselves forward into battles they were ill-prepared for, when they realized the terror that lay ahead if they failed to resist the dark forces which were prepared to do them great harm."
  "The war in CyberSpace may lie in the future, when the majority of the masses realize that CyberHitler wants *more* than just CyberPoland. When the masses realize that the CyberGestapo aren't coming only for the CyberJews.
  "...but the revolution is *now*."
  "God help us all if those present at the CypherPunks meeting don't understand the true importance of Eric Hughes, a decade after 'The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre' was written, echoing the words of Bubba Rom Dos when he said, 'It's up to *you* and *I*.'"
  "God help us all if those involved with Alt2600 believe that they are just playing an interesting game of 'good guys versus bad guys,' and fail to see that the importance of the guerilla manuals they make available on this or that system is not in the affrontery it provides to the self-proclaimed, righteous, namby-pamby do-gooders, but to make it possible for some child of the future to know how to make a molotov cocktail when the Sedona, Arizona, SWAT-Team is preparing to assault their home with the heavy artillery proved for them by the federal government.
  "God help us all if normal, average, boring mathematicians like Peter Trei fail to realize that every line of code they write may someday become a chambered round of ammunition that provides the final blow which brings down the Great Digital Beast that is destined to rule us all if it is able to grow and prosper without resistance."
  "I hope and pray that Lucky Green, and others like him, begin to realize that the future is now, and that they *are* the future...that we *all* are the future.
  "The revolution is *now*, and *we* are the revolution.
  "If enough people realize that, and write the single lines of code with their attitudes, their beliefs, their votes and their actions, then maybe 'The True Story of the InterNet' will become just an interesting story--a cute fantasy instead of a dark harbinger of the   "Maybe the dark clouds gathering over Digital Europe will dissipate and the sun will shine through, to make us all laugh at our silly fears about bad men and beasts who have dark designs to imprison our bodies and minds in physical and digital prisons, and who will require us to place a yellow star at the beginning of our email   "Am I being silly, again? God, I hope so.  Goodnight, dear..."

~       SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY DRUGS / PROLOGUE 3/0
The Most Dangerous Man In Lost Wagess:
  They had followed him from the CypherPunks physical meeting to the outskirts of Las Vegas, before losing him. Two days of
frantic searching by a variety of law enforcement agencies led to the Plaza Hotel and Casino, where he was playing the
penny slot machine and associating with a variety of local
riff(c)raff and no(c)accounts.
  An in(c)depth consultation with the Plaza head of security
revealed that they had been keeping a close eye on the
subject for the last two days.
  "He doesn't cause any real trouble, or anything," the
head honcho said, shrugging, "but everything about him
seems just a little strange, if you know what I mean."
  This comment seemed designed to elicit some sort of
response from the poker(c)faced men questioning him, but
they failed to respond, merely waiting for him to   "He buys ten dollars worth of pennies," and tips
the change lady a dollar. "He plays for hours on
end, also tipping the waitresses a dollar every
time they bring him a free beer. Hell, he even tips
the cleaning people when they clean his ashtray."
  The honcho shook his head, as if this type of
behavior from someone spending most of their time
playing the penny slots was puzzling and also
  "Sleeps in his car, with his dog. Only leaves the
slot machines to feed, water, and run his dog around
our parking lot. It's kind of unnatural, the way he
seems to dote on that animal." the security honcho
winked knowingly.
  "Has he met with anyone who doesn't usually frequent your casino?" one of the men asked,
impatiently, tired of hearing odd details of the
man's lifestyle which seemed intriguing to the
denziens of normality that they were constantly
having to interview in regard to the subject's
movement and activity.
  "He ran into some legal(c)eagle named Larry Joe,"
the honcho said, noting the first sign of interest
shown by his interrogators. "My second(c)shift security
chief says he's a middle(c)weight poker player, taking
part in a tournament at the Rio..." adding with a
knowing tone, "but the mouthpiece is hanging with
one of the heavy hitters on the local poker scene."
  "Larry Joe Dowling, an Austin attorney." one of
the interrogators said to the others. "He usuallyÜj
We'd better shift our surveillance team into
high gear."
  The man rose to leave, telling the others, "Dig
up all you can here, file a report, and get some
sleep. You're going to need it."
Boogers? We don't need no stinking boogers!:
  The agent pulled out his hanky and wiped the disgusting
mess off of his jacket sleeve.
  "I can't believe that they pulled us off of the
Tim May detail to check out this fucking loser."
  "Shit!" he screamed, as he brushed his arm against
the steering column and picked up another piece of
disgusting slime on his jacket sleeve.
  "I've shaken down this guy's personals before." the
man's partner said, with a grin. "That's why I gave
you the driver's side of the vehicle to check out."
  "He feeds his nose(c)candy to his dog, and he always
leaves her a little desert on the steering wheel
for her to chow down on after he brings her back
from her walk." He laughed as he saw the bile
rising to his new partner's throat.
  He couldn't help himself(c)(c)he reached over and
plucked a booker off of the horn button and told
his partner, "I'll trade you a green one for a
yellow one..."
  His partner lurched out of the vehicle and
concentrated on tossing his lunch while not messing
up his shiny new shoes.
  The more experienced agent finished snapping photos
of the gathered items and then replaced them carefully
in the same position they had been in before their
  "He usually walks Baby for about ten minutes, to give us time to make a complete pass of his vehicle,
so our time is about up." The agent closed and locked the doors of the vehicle, motioning his
green(c)faced partner toward their vehicle.
It's A Nuke! No, It's Anthrax! No, It's...AAARRGGGHHHH!!!":
  Justin Case, Special Agent in Charge of the current
investigation, was bothered by the fact that the suspect
had seemed to be doing nothing more than wandering around
various sites and casinos in Las Vegas, with no apparent
pattern or plan to his movement and actions. Until he
read the report of the suspect's lingering interest in
the placement of the columns serving as the foundation for the Stratosphere Casino, and the layout of the
preliminary work on the new Foley Federal BuildingÜj
  "Soft targets." agent Case said out loud, causing
a considerable amount of disconcertment to his fellow
agent, Bobby Siller.
  "Damn!" Siller swore, "We have reports of him having
met with Leavitt and Harris, but we didn't have any
taps on them, so we don't have any details of what
they are planning."
  "Don't worry about it," Case seemed unconcerned, "if
he's scouting soft targets, then he's not planning any
sudden moves."
  "Patience comes to those who wait." Justin Case said,
softly, quoting the Author, and making a mental note to
have agent Siller shake the Anthrax Twins down a few
days after the suspect departed Vegas.
  "Hold it!" agent Siller shouted, motioning for his
superior to remain silent, as Siller adjusted his
earpiece to more clearly hear the live report he was
receiving from his agents at the Riviera gun show.
  "The suspect went into the gun show empty handed,
and left with several copies of 'Gun List' and then
returned to his vehicle. He took his dog for a walk
and our agents discovered a 'Dalian' watch wrapped
in tear(c)outs from the firearms paper, dealing with
Romanian AK rifles and Bulgarian SLR(c)95's. The 'Dalian' watch is some type of Polish/Chinese make,
or something."
  Justin Case rolled his eyes, but remained silent.
The suspect was yanking the chains of the agents who
were shaking down his personals, and it looked like
Siller's men didn't have the experience to know when
they were being toyed with.
  The agent that Case had pulled off of the Tim May
detail would be wise to the suspect's shenanigans,
but it was unlikely he would get in the way of
Siller's men making fools of themselves.
  "He's returning to the casino, using the copies
of 'Gun List' to hide whatever it is he's carrying."
agent Siller said, with great excitement.
  "I think we ought to take him in the parking garage, before he reaches the main building at the
Riviera." Siller anxiously awaited the word from
his superior.
  "Maintain." was Case's nonchalant reply, causing
Siller to have an ill(c)disguised internal shit(c)fit.
If this operation went totally to hell, it would
be Siller's ass on the line, being the Las Vegas
station chief.

  "Maintain," Siller told his agents, but couldn't help adding, "and disclose."
  This was a vague term meant to signal his men to intercept the suspect and do a bump(c)and(c)run on him
to sniff out what it was he was hiding(c)(c)without alerting
Siller's superior that his orders were being countermanded.
  "The Electronic Privacy Papers." agent Case said, to no
one in particular.
  "What?" Siller asked, perplexed.
  "Documents on the Battle for Privacy in the Age of
Surveillance, by Bruce Schneier and David Banisar,
ISBN: 0(c)471(c)12297(c)1."
  Much to agent Siller's consternation, his superior
continued, "That's what your men are going to discover
he is hiding furtively under those copies of the 'Gun
List' magazines when they disobey my orders and risk
blowing their cover."
  "It's the suspect's form of humor." Justin Case
smiled at his subordinate's discomfort.
  "He's laughing at all the spooks from various
agencies, including yours and mine, who are at the
gun show shadowing the Anthrax Twins, the Samsonite
Nuclear Warrior, and various members of the Loose(c)Screw
Gun Nut Club."
  Seeing the confused look on agent Siller's face, he
explained further. "The suspect is laughing because
he believes he is carrying the most dangerous weapon
available at the gun show."
  "And he's probably right..." Case said, with a far(c)
away look in his eyes that sent shivers down agent
Siller's spine.
  Special agent Justin Case took a tattered copy of
a paperback titled, "Paper Prison" out of his inside
jacket pocket, and stared at it(c)(c)lost in a universe
that belonged far in the past, but which seemed to
be intersecting the present in a manner which bode
nothing but ill for those who continued to live in
  "The future is now..." Justin Case said, in a low
monotone voice that seemed to come from a world beyond
the one in which he and agent Siller were so diligently
pursuing the 'Threat of the Day'.
  "He's carrying a book." the voice came crackling
through Siller's earpiece.
  "Never mind." Siller said, adding, "Maintain."
  "Maintain." Siller repeated inwardly, to himself,Üj
crept up his spine and into the lower regions of
his mind as he observed the strange, semi(c)hypnotic
state that his superior had entered into.
  "Maintain."

When Existence Is Outlawed, Only Outlaws Will Exist:
  The revolution is now.
  The only question that those who have the balls to
participate in the inevitable chaos which will be needed
to balance the Tao against the current onslaught of
digitally structured reality that is being forced upon
humanity by the new technology being promoted by the
pawns of the reptilian Nazis whose headquarters is deep
within the confines of the AdamAntarctic is: "Whose brain
do I put my first bullet through?"
  For many, the answer will be, "TruthMonger!"
  Nobody likes to hear the truth, and the truth is: We
all deserve to die.
  Not only that, but the extinction of humanity, according
to our current values, epitomizes the crowning glory of
our evolutionary path.
  What places us *above* the other primates and the other
forms of life on our planet? What is it that makes us
special, that deems us worthy of ruling over all other
life forms on the planet Earth?
  It is our ability to control; our ability to master
our environment and the objects and life(c)forms contained
within its bounds. Ultimately, it is our ability to *kill*
whatever stands in the way of the fulfillment of our desires
and our goals.
  For all of our soul(c)searching, spiritual posturing, deep
down inside we all know that we live in a predatorial universe. Republicans cry out for bigger guns to defend
our way of life from everyone who fails to salute the flag.
Democrats cry out for the press and political leaders to
invent enemies to justify the liberals crying out for
bigger guns to protect us from the 'bad guys.'
  And it's all bullshit...
  The reason we need to launch wars and destroy our
environment is to keep the price of our refrigerators
and our color TV's reasonable(c)(c)to keep the price of aÜj
dollar high enough that we can feel good about ourselves
for saving a starving child for less than ten cents a day,
while ignoring the fact that an obese Sally Fields could
save more starving children in a week than we possibly could in a lifetime, just by donating one of her lunches
to the charity she is promoting.
Think About This, You Stupid Fucking Bastards:
  Why do we need to allow our basic human rights and
freedoms to be compromised?: In order for our hallowed
leaders and our protectors in the law enforcement
community to adequately protect us from the 'bad guys.'
  Why do we need to be protected from the 'bad guys'?:
Because if they win out over the 'good guys', they will take away our basic human rights and freedoms.

The Most Dangerous Man In Lost Wagess:
  They had followed him from the CypherPunks physical meeting to the outskirts of Las Vegas, before losing him. Two days of
frantic searching by a variety of law enforcement agencies led to the Plaza Hotel and Casino, where he was playing the
penny slot machine and associating with a variety of local
riff(c)raff and no(c)accounts.
  An in(c)depth consultation with the Plaza head of security
revealed that they had been keeping a close eye on the
subject for the last two days.
  "He doesn't cause any real trouble, or anything," the
head honcho said, shrugging, "but everything about him
seems just a little strange, if you know what I mean."
  This comment seemed designed to elicit some sort of
response from the poker(c)faced men questioning him, but
they failed to respond, merely waiting for him to   "He buys ten dollars worth of pennies," and tips
the change lady a dollar. "He plays for hours on
end, also tipping the waitresses a dollar every
time they bring him a free beer. Hell, he even tips
the cleaning people when they clean his ashtray."
  The honcho shook his head, as if this type of
behavior from someone spending most of their time
playing the penny slots was puzzling and also
  "Sleeps in his car, with his dog. Only leaves the
slot machines to feed, water, and run his dog around
our parking lot. It's kind of unnatural, the way he
seems to dote on that animal." the security honcho
winked knowingly.
  "Has he met with anyone who doesn't usually frequent your casino?" one of the men asked,
impatiently, tired of hearing odd details of the
man's lifestyle which seemed intriguing to the
denziens of normality that they were constantly
having to interview in regard to the subject's
movement and activity.
  "He ran into some legal(c)eagle named Larry Joe,"
the honcho said, noting the first sign of interest
shown by his interrogators. "My second(c)shift security
chief says he's a middle(c)weight poker player, taking
part in a tournament at the Rio..." adding with a
knowing tone, "but the mouthpiece is hanging with
one of the heavy hitters on the local poker scene."
  "Larry Joe Dowling, an Austin attorney." one of
the interrogators said to the others. "He usuallyÜj
We'd better shift our surveillance team into
high gear."
  The man rose to leave, telling the others, "Dig
up all you can here, file a report, and get some
sleep. You're going to need it."
Boogers? We don't need no stinking boogers!:
  The agent pulled out his hanky and wiped the disgusting
mess off of his jacket sleeve.
  "I can't believe that they pulled us off of the
Tim May detail to check out this fucking loser."
  "Shit!" he screamed, as he brushed his arm against
the steering column and picked up another piece of
disgusting slime on his jacket sleeve.
  "I've shaken down this guy's personals before." the
man's partner said, with a grin. "That's why I gave
you the driver's side of the vehicle to check out."
  "He feeds his nose(c)candy to his dog, and he always
leaves her a little desert on the steering wheel
for her to chow down on after he brings her back
from her walk." He laughed as he saw the bile
rising to his new partner's throat.
  He couldn't help himself(c)(c)he reached over and
plucked a booker off of the horn button and told
his partner, "I'll trade you a green one for a
yellow one..."
  His partner lurched out of the vehicle and
concentrated on tossing his lunch while not messing
up his shiny new shoes.
  The more experienced agent finished snapping photos
of the gathered items and then replaced them carefully
in the same position they had been in before their
  "He usually walks Baby for about ten minutes, to give us time to make a complete pass of his vehicle,
so our time is about up." The agent closed and locked the doors of the vehicle, motioning his
green(c)faced partner toward their vehicle.
It's A Nuke! No, It's Anthrax! No, It's...AAARRGGGHHHH!!!":
  Justin Case, Special Agent in Charge of the current
investigation, was bothered by the fact that the suspect
had seemed to be doing nothing more than wandering around
various sites and casinos in Las Vegas, with no apparent
pattern or plan to his movement and actions. Until he
read the report of the suspect's lingering interest in
the placement of the columns serving as the foundation for the Stratosphere Casino, and the layout of the
preliminary work on the new Foley Federal BuildingÜj
  "Soft targets." agent Case said out loud, causing
a considerable amount of disconcertment to his fellow
agent, Bobby Siller.
  "Damn!" Siller swore, "We have reports of him having
met with Leavitt and Harris, but we didn't have any
taps on them, so we don't have any details of what
they are planning."
  "Don't worry about it," Case seemed unconcerned, "if
he's scouting soft targets, then he's not planning any
sudden moves."
  "Patience comes to those who wait." Justin Case said,
softly, quoting the Author, and making a mental note to
have agent Siller shake the Anthrax Twins down a few
days after the suspect departed Vegas.
  "Hold it!" agent Siller shouted, motioning for his
superior to remain silent, as Siller adjusted his
earpiece to more clearly hear the live report he was
receiving from his agents at the Riviera gun show.
  "The suspect went into the gun show empty handed,
and left with several copies of 'Gun List' and then
returned to his vehicle. He took his dog for a walk
and our agents discovered a 'Dalian' watch wrapped
in tear(c)outs from the firearms paper, dealing with
Romanian AK rifles and Bulgarian SLR(c)95's. The 'Dalian' watch is some type of Polish/Chinese make,
or something."
  Justin Case rolled his eyes, but remained silent.
The suspect was yanking the chains of the agents who
were shaking down his personals, and it looked like
Siller's men didn't have the experience to know when
they were being toyed with.
  The agent that Case had pulled off of the Tim May
detail would be wise to the suspect's shenanigans,
but it was unlikely he would get in the way of
Siller's men making fools of themselves.
  "He's returning to the casino, using the copies
of 'Gun List' to hide whatever it is he's carrying."
agent Siller said, with great excitement.
  "I think we ought to take him in the parking garage, before he reaches the main building at the
Riviera." Siller anxiously awaited the word from
his superior.
  "Maintain." was Case's nonchalant reply, causing
Siller to have an ill(c)disguised internal shit(c)fit.
If this operation went totally to hell, it would
be Siller's ass on the line, being the Las Vegas
station chief.

  "Maintain," Siller told his agents, but couldn't help adding, "and disclose."
  This was a vague term meant to signal his men to intercept the suspect and do a bump(c)and(c)run on him
to sniff out what it was he was hiding(c)(c)without alerting
Siller's superior that his orders were being countermanded.
  "The Electronic Privacy Papers." agent Case said, to no
one in particular.
  "What?" Siller asked, perplexed.
  "Documents on the Battle for Privacy in the Age of
Surveillance, by Bruce Schneier and David Banisar,
ISBN: 0(c)471(c)12297(c)1."
  Much to agent Siller's consternation, his superior
continued, "That's what your men are going to discover
he is hiding furtively under those copies of the 'Gun
List' magazines when they disobey my orders and risk
blowing their cover."
  "It's the suspect's form of humor." Justin Case
smiled at his subordinate's discomfort.
  "He's laughing at all the spooks from various
agencies, including yours and mine, who are at the
gun show shadowing the Anthrax Twins, the Samsonite
Nuclear Warrior, and various members of the Loose(c)Screw
Gun Nut Club."
  Seeing the confused look on agent Siller's face, he
explained further. "The suspect is laughing because
he believes he is carrying the most dangerous weapon
available at the gun show."
  "And he's probably right..." Case said, with a far(c)
away look in his eyes that sent shivers down agent
Siller's spine.
  Special agent Justin Case took a tattered copy of
a paperback titled, "Paper Prison" out of his inside
jacket pocket, and stared at it(c)(c)lost in a universe
that belonged far in the past, but which seemed to
be intersecting the present in a manner which bode
nothing but ill for those who continued to live in
  "The future is now..." Justin Case said, in a low
monotone voice that seemed to come from a world beyond
the one in which he and agent Siller were so diligently
pursuing the 'Threat of the Day'.
  "He's carrying a book." the voice came crackling
through Siller's earpiece.
  "Never mind." Siller said, adding, "Maintain."
  "Maintain." Siller repeated inwardly, to himself,Üj
crept up his spine and into the lower regions of
his mind as he observed the strange, semi(c)hypnotic
state that his superior had entered into.
  "Maintain."

The Story Thus Far:
  (Or so we would have you believe...)
It is now commonly known that:
  American overt and covert spook agencies of one sort or another monitor--legally and illegally--almost all of
the electronic communications in the world.
  American overt and covert spook agencies, legally and
illegally make and break the finances of nations and
corporations around the world.
  Overt and covert spook agencies of other nations do
exactly the same thing, on differing scales.
  Internationally powerful financial agencies, groups
and individuals make daily decisions affecting the lives
of individuals, societies and nations, based on the
desires and goals of individuals who are above and beyond
the control of any nation or group of nations.
  Joe and Jane Sheeple are not privy to information as
to who, exactly, these people are, or what their ultimate
designs are for our future.
  Human rights and freedoms, throughout the world, are
contingent upon heavily armed governments allowing us
those rights and freedoms which they perceive to be
in our best overall interest.
  Those heavily armed governments are increasingly acting in concert with one another, dividing up our
finances, property and our human rights among themselves
at the slightest whim.
If It Prevents Just A Single Starving Biafran Child
  This is why 'Higher Authority' (government, business,
a person with a large wallet or a large gun) feels compelled
to 'serve and protect' the Sheeple.
  Of course, this all comes at a cost...
  Own your own home? Bullshit!
  I don't care if you paid cash and have clear title--if you
fail to pay property taxes to men with guns who say that you
*have* to, then you are out on the street, tomorrow.
  Growing organic vegetables? Bullshit!
  Unless you have proper state certification, after having
filled in the mountains of documentation and paid numerous
filing fees, registration fees, incremental fees and excremental fees, as well as having paid for a mountain
of testing by an independent (government approved) laboratory, thenyour sorry ass is going to jail if you whisper the word "organic" in your sleep.
  Do you have a name? Bullshit!
  I don't care what you call yourself, what your momma calls
you, or what name is on your birth certificate, you are a number, and you goddamn well better *have* that fucking
number ready if you want to drive a car, cross the street,
make a purchase, sell something, stand in line to get a
number, or breathe.
NEWS FLASH!!!
[Author's Note: You may want to skip the next paragraph,
 if you have a weak heart, or have suicidal tendencies,
 because it speaks a truth that is too ugly for most of
 us to face, even in the best of times.]
  The ONLY time that the powers-that-be recognize you as

because the more you think about it, the more obviously
true it becomes.

your position and status in life for use by the government
and business during your journey from the cradle to the

sort of exotic disease or disability?
  Spare me the detail, pal. It doesn't matter how hard you
fought, how valiantly you risked your life, how many kids
you have to feed, what sort of medical history you can
provide about yourself before, during and after the event.
  Your number gets lumped in with the other numbers who
got sick or disabled, and then the number-crunchers decide
if the country you defended can afford for you all to
be sick and disabled.

PROLOGUE 6/0 -- SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY DRUGS
Wasting (Everyone) Away In Mongeritaville:
  A man with a gun came to my door recently, and demanded
that I pony-up thirty dollars to members of his gang's
protection racket. If I refuse to pay, he will be back
with other armed thugs.
  If I resist them, they will kill me.
  Sure, when they drag me in front of one of the big
bosses in their protection racket, I can try to talk
them out of robbing and/or killing me, but it will
inevitably end up with Frank Moretti telling Al Capone,
"If we let this schmuck walk away without ponying-up,
then how are we going to keep the others in line."
  In the end, I either pay up or die.   It's all because of my dog...
  "Dog running at large." That's what the first threatening
message from the Town of Bienfait said.
  "Voluntary fine." It also said that--with a veiled hint
that if I refused to 'do the right thing', that I might
find myself having a little 'trouble'.
  I had an uncle who found himself forced to deal with these
kind of thugs when he had a small shop on the bad side of
the tracks in a big city. Then he moved to the 'good side of town' and found out that the only difference was that
the vigorish was higher, and the thugs were better dressed.
  It's the American Way (TM)... If you want to be robbed
by a better class of thugs, then you can expect to pay a
little more for being beaten with gold-knuckles, instead
of brass-knuckles, if you're a little late on your payment.
I'm A Funny Guy, Eh?:
  No, I'm serious...
  If I fail to pay the Town of Bienfait thirty dollars
for allowing my dog, whom I have not had a single complaint
about from any of my neighbors or fellow citizens, to experience the freedom that should be the birthright of
every living creature, then those who rule over the
land I currently live on (under the authority of armed
enforcers), are willing to put me to death.
  They don't like to kill the goose that laid the golden
egg, Jane or Joe Sheeple, so they prefer to start by
placing them in bondage, kidnapping them, and holding
them prisoner in small cages until they get the message
that they are not to be fucked with.
  If you resist being kidnapped and imprisoned, they have
no choice but to send more and better armed thugs to
overcome your resistance, murdering you if you refuse to
recognize and submit to their authority over you, no matter how unjust or uncivilized their decisions and
their actions.
  My dog, Baby, doesn't speak Cherokee, so when the
armed thugs approach, she just barks.
  She barks, "The Revolution Is NOW!"
TownShip of MongerItaville -- Population - 1:
  I have self-incorporated (self-actualized, for you
people living in New Age, California) the Township of
MongerItaville, in my own mind, and voted myself the
Grand Pooh-Bah(Humbug) of the domain it encompasses,
which can be found by reaching behind myself and
grabbing my ass. (Wherever I go, there I am...)
  I was elected unanimusly (not a typo), since in
MongerItaville dogs can vote, but women can't.
  (Sorry, Baby, but I only had the Founding Fathers
to use as a role-model...there weren't any Founding
  As the sole citizen and the head of government of
MongerItaville, I had to make a decision as to whether it was better to attempt to reinvent the
wheel, so to speak, by following the example of
the founders of American democracy, or to take a
more realistic approach and automatically grant
myself all of the same powers as have been assumed
by the current governmental and bureacratic representatives of the evolution of freedom and
  In the beginning, I decided to do both, no matter
how schizophrenic the results, since it seemed obvious
that anything less would be the equivalent of bending
over for the soap in the shower at the Home For The
Criminally Insane.
  I wrote a 'Realistic Bill of Rights' for the TownShip]
of MongerItaville, including such gems as:
~A well-armed and well-lubricated milita being essential
to the security of my butt-hole, my right to get stinking
fucking drunk and 'Load and Lock' (or whatever) shall not
be a bridge over troubled water.
[Editor's Note: Realistically, the preceeding should
read, "Load (Boom!--"Goddamn, I just blew my foot
off!") and Lock."]
~My right to be secure in my person (especially in the
rear part) and my electronic emmissions (internal and
external) will be the responsibility of no one other
than myself (and possibly Phil Zimmerman and Matt
~I will not discriminate against anyone on the basis
of age, race, sex, sexual orientation, or breed.

Hey! Those Aren't Amendments! Those Are Justifications!:
  I decided on only two amendments. One to my physical

my intellectual Constitution--I'm the government, and

  I suppose that the latter amendment may no be
politically correct in a Berkeley kind of society,
but at least it is consistent with the recognition
of my right to life, liberty, and pursuit of cynicism.
I May Be A Stupid Fuck, But At Least I'm Not A Stupid Fuck:
  Anyone who thinks I am overreacting reads the daily news with their blinders on...
  Remember the old broad in New England whose family decided she had to be imprisoned against her will in
a looney bin for observation ("We just want to ask
you a few questions...") because she had put up with
society's bullshit long enough to have earned the
right to be 'eccentric'. (That's what you're called
if your filthy fucking rich and let your toenails
grow so long that they curl up like a ram's horns.)
  Would the armed thugs pretending to 'serve and
protect' have been using rubber bullets if there was
no press present? (Can you say 'Ruby Ridge'? Sure
you can...)
  What if the grandmother busted for helping a stranger
avoid paying vigorish to the armed thugs by plugging
parking meters had told the thugs, "Fuck you! You assholes are crazy and out of control. I refuse to
be subject to the insanity of your armed rule over
every detail of the citizen's life."?
  She would be one dead cunt...
What's Good For The Gander Is Good For Those Getting Goosed:
  Am I overreacting?
  I am being muscled by thugs that will murder me over
thirty dollars, just to maintain their control over the
Sheeple that they rule.
  Any way you want to cut it, you cannot deny that you know
this is true.
  Do you understand?
  Do you understand that these people are willing to murder
a compound full of people holding 'eccentric' religious
beliefs--men, women and children--justifying their actions
on the grounds of what they later admit are lies?
  Do you understand that instead of admitting to their
criminal actions, they will make criminals of the survivors,
placing them in prisons designed to reinforce upon the
citizenry that even their children will be slaughtered if
they are so bold as to say, "The King has no clothes."

    Can you pick up a paper without reading about some
atrocity being perpetrated on individuals and groups of
citizens by the armed thugs in power?
[Tuscon Nutly News--MILITARY ANALYSTS REPORT THAT IN
the last three years, 42,384,672 senior and general
Army officers were accused of offenses including child
molestation and adultery--and not one was prosecuted.
Each was allowed simply to retire.
  Sgt. Maj. Gene C. McKinney, however, not being an
officer, faces 55 years in prison for lechery, as a result of being accused of an act of foreplay
that occured during consensual sex with a woman
not his wife.
  Sgt. Maj. McKinney, when reached for comment by
the Left Nutly News, said, "I should have 'accidentally'
killed her after sex. Under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice, negligent homicide only carries a maximum
sentence of *three* years."
  Joseph Finder, author of the novel "High Crimes," told
Nutly News reportwhores, in response to allegations that
the Nutly News was misquoting his article and inflating
the numbers involved for shock effect, said, "I write for the mainstream media. I'm supposed to pretend that
murdering a hundred innocent children makes someone
more of a monster than murdering a single innocent child,
especially if the murderer voted to give my publisher
a huge tax-break for requiring his staff to make certain
that the child was born naked, and thus was obviously
involved in some sort of child-pornography ring."
When asked for comment, a Pentagon spin-liar told Nutly News reportwhores, "It's called the Uniform Code
of Military Justice because we look at what kind of
uniform they are wearing, and then decide what kind of
justice they are going to get."]
  Can you pick up a newspaper without reading about some
totally clueless dickwad--who is licensed to carry a gun,
shoot any citizen on the slightest whim, and then lie
about it in court under cover of a neatly-pressed uniform
and shiny badge--performing some outrageous act that an
ordinary citizen would be lynched for?
[Tucson Nutly News--WHEN THE POLICE OFFICER WHO PLAYS THE
role of McGruff, the police dog (Take a bite out of crime)
was unavailable, a fellow police monger called upon the
services of an inmate incarcerated for child molestation
to fill in as McGruff, in a school classroom containing
one of the child rapist's victims.
Although the voice of Charles Darwin could be heard
calling out from the grave, "Put a bullet in this ignorant
Pig's head, before he breeds.", the citizenry merely turned
to the weather section of the paper, to see if the weekend
would be nice enough for them to take their children to
the park, where the same ignorant piece-of-shit police
officer would be in charge of 'serving' the children up
to convicted child-molesters, and 'protecting' himself
from suffering the consequences of his incompetence by
making sure that his union dues were paid up.
  When asked for comment, McGruff, the police dog, told
this reportwhore, "The regular guy's not back yet...do
you have any children...do you have any pictures of them naked?"

over the paid political spin-doctoring of the mainstream
In a startling development with global consequences, the
recent actions taking place in a Cult of One community
in Southern Saskatchewan, the TownShip of MongerItaville,
have been embraced by citizens around the globe in light
of the information reported by independent observers
relaying a wide variety of details via the InterNet and

  MenInTheShadows unable to find the second VirtualNuclear
Device claimed to have been planted in a pubic building
eleven KILLometers from MongerItaVille--wondering if their
first mistake hadn't been to threaten a six-year old child
and his mother with deportation from Canada if they continued
to involve themselves in the battle for Medicare in Saskatchewan.
  For almost a half-century thereafter, the child had been a
thorn in their side, seemingly breaking every rule in the book,
violating everything that anal-retentive WhiteCanadianImmigrants
held sacred as they strove to promote the Rule of (White)Law
in the Great White Snort. Despite their many failed attempts
to imprison him, ususally succeeding only in harrassing him
and causing him great personal loss and expense, they had never
before had to fear for their own lives and the safety of their
families, but now all that had changed...
  An elite, secretive cabal of Mounties gathered around a table
reviewing the security implications of a hidden file being found
on their computer system which had the same name as the file
on the floppy disk left at the site of the first VirtualNuclear
Device found in a public building eleven KILLometers from
  Silence in the room as each of them heard, in their own mind,
the screams of the Author as they resounded through the Analogue
Reality of his home in Bienfait, through the Digital Reality of
MongerItaVille, and through the MeatSpace DigiZeros on a dozen
or more Canadian Government computer systems.
  "OU WANT TO FUCK WITH *CHILDREN*? OU WANT TO STEAL M NEPHEWS'
COMPUTERS? OU WANT TO FILE FALSE CHARGES ON M NEIGHBOR'S FUTURE
LITTLE GLUE-SNIFFER, OU NAZI RATFUCKERS?
  "THE *MEATSPACE* REVOLUTION IS *NOW*!!!!"
  The Author may be bluffing, of course, but could they really afford to take that chance?
  HeOrShe had offered them "pole position" on receiving the key
that the BackDoor Boogie (TM) was being played in to provide a
soundtrack to the RCMP Musical Ride taking place on Trojan Horses
ridden by DigitalAnarchists throughout Canadian Government computer
  The offer was simple enough...return all of the stolen computers
to the possession of Human Gus-Peter and the RCMP would get the
checkered flag in the race against finding their digital security
breach...if there, in fact, *was* one...
  The 'clues' of its existence were rather vague, though startling,
and they could conceivably be the result of collusion on a part of
the Author's widespread Inner Circle, which undoubtedly included
more than a few people with access to secure Canadian Government
computer systems.
  Of course, the phrase 'pole position' implied that there were
others in the race who the Author could bless with the checkered
flag if they were the first to provide Human Gus-Peter with a
state-of-the-art portable multi-media computer such as the one
that had been stolen from the Author, but the Mounties were
reluctant to suffer the loss of face that would be involved in
rectifying the consequences of their own illegal and heavy-handed
acts of oppression and repression.
  The Mounties knew that they were, to a certain extent, vulnerable,
having actively promoted the persecution of a mentally unstable
individual at a time when his medications were running low, in the
hope that he would explode in a manner that would cause him to
perform actions which he could be legally held accountable for.
It wouldn't look good, however, if it came out that the Mounties
themselves were taking the precaution of wearing bullet-proof vests
for their own protection during their attempts to provoke the
Author to actions of raging insanity, while leaving the children of
the community vulnerable to the MeatSpace actions of a violent
psychotic currently writing the "Bienfait Nutly News 'KILL THE
CHILDREN' Special."
  The RCMP had failed to intercept the computer disks and audio
tapes that the Author had mailed to Declan McCullagh from Montana,
but the Netly News journalist had not yet received them, so it
seemed that *someone* had intercepted them.
  Every indication was that there was only a single copy of the
material the Author had stashed south of the 49th parallel just
before his computers were confiscated, but there was no telling,
for sure. Besides, the Mounties had confiscated the voice-activated
tape recorder they found on their last illegal entry to his home,
and the audio tapes he had could conceivably be of one of the
American intelligence agents monitoring his residence, such as
the retired Air Force Intelligence officer who had become rather
friendly with him at the CoalDust Saloon.]
  It was a shame that the Author had found and destroyed the
'evidence' they had planted in his truck shortly before he skipped the country, but the 'evidence' they had 'found' after
his departure would suffice. The reference to the *second*
VirtualNuclearDevice was troubling, however, since its existence,
if real, could result in the whole operation blowing up in their
  Nonetheless, the Mounties considered it better to lose a few
citizens, or even a whole town, than to lose face, and the
Author's modus operandi was to provide fair warning before the
date and time of his nefarious activities, so the Mounties were
confident that they could follow in the footsteps of the BATF and
arrange to be conveniently gone when the shit hit the fan.
  Then they would have that ShitDisturbingMonster dead to rights...

RIP/BNN - SPACE ALIENS HIDE M DRUGS!!!
Bienfait Nutly News--Desert Storm / Texas Tornado Special:
[BNN-Tucson, Arizona--THE 'FOUR CORNERS' SEARCH FOR A PAIR OF
Certified CopKillers took a bizarre twist today, when it was
learned that the Author of SPACE ALIENS HIDE M DRUGS was
apparently serving merely as a diversionary decoy for LEA's
involved in the search, while an unknown compatriot was busy
either providing clandestine supply support for the pair, or
perhaps even arranging transportation for the suspects to a
safehouse located outside of the search area.
  Under cross-examination by a variety of LEA/Spooks, the RCMP involved in setting up the Author on a variety of charges
under the Criminal Code Of Canada admitted that they had been
holding back evidence suggesting that the Author was not acting
alone in his TRIN VirtualNuclear Diskette Bomb Soft Target
World Tour. Newspapers dated after the Author's flight to
semi-safety south of the forty-ninth parallel were found at
the scene of the first VirtualNuclear Device discovered by
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at the Court House eleven
KILLometers from MongerItaVille, home of the Bienfait Nutly
News, where the Author was scheduled to be railroaded into
serving a four-year sentence for 'Failure To Appear' on the
'Dog At Large' charges trumped up by local Bienfait officials
under RCMP direction.
  "There were two different sets of newspapers dated after
the Author's flight from Canada found at the scene of the
First VirtualNuclear Device." an RCMP official foolishly
revealed to the Flying Spook assigned by the US Air Force
to investigate the Author, never considering that the agent
may have been 'turned' by the Circle of Eunuchs into a
secret ally. "We traced the placement of one of the sets
of newspapers to the Author's nephew, Human Gus-Peter, who
had been promised a new state-of-the-art computer in return
for helping to obstrufucate the details behind the placement
of the TRIN VNDB Device. The second set of newpapers, from
an earlier date, were obviously placed by an unknown entity,
working in collusion with the Author from the beginning."
  The Flying Spook, in his first action as the new editor-
in-chief of the Bienfait Nutly News, informed the RCMP that
the Author, after mailing evidence of RCMP illegal activity,
collusion and conspiracy to a Time/Netly News reportwhore
from Sidney, Montana, had holed up Way Station in
Gillette, Montana, for a few days, proceeding south only
after meeting with a shadowy figure who had given one of
the local residents of the homeless shelter a handful of
Canadian coins when asked for spare change.
  The Flying Spook also suggested that the Author's travel
schedule, seemingly laying an interrupted trail through
the HeartLand of paramilitary activity on the way to theYT
targets along the way, was actually a diversionary tactic
designed to divert attention from the movements of his
conspiratorial compatriot--rumored to be a long-time active
member of the Circle of Eunuchs and CyphperPunks Disturbed
Male LISP, as well as a recent inductee into the Army of
  The new Editor-In-Chief of the Bienfait Nutly News also
revealed that his investigation into the alleged connection
of the NuclearBomberAdulteress in Minot, North Dakota, and
the ButtonBomberJoyRider from Tucson, Arizona, to the
Circle of Eunuchs and Army of Dog had turned up a variety
of startling facts, despite the Flying Spook's failure to
include those facts in his official report.
  Among those facts are the following:
EveryBody Wants To Go To Soviet Heaven, But No One Wants To Spy:
  It took the Flying Spook only a few weeks to verify hard links
between the Author and a variety of single, double and triple
agents ranging from Scotland to the Middle East--from the 1800's
to the 1990's.
  The Author's background had been invesigated previously, to
little avail, and the Flying Spook was mystified as to how
apparently competent investigators could fail to realize that
the key to covert and subversive links very often lie in the
history of the women 'behind the throne', so to speak.
  Elanor Roosevelt, Lady Byrd Johnson, Nancy Reagan...even
Casper's Cousins unfamiliar with the course of history should
be able to see the implication implied by these recent examples
of the Hidden Hands Of Destiny working through the wives of
those serving as the front men for the true movers and shakers
in society.
  The Zippo lighter bearing the crest of the Naval Guided
Missle School carried by the Author had long been dismissed
as an insignificant detail by a long string of investigators
who crossed paths with HimOrHer at various times and places.
  It was the family history of Polly McWilliams that allowed
the Flying Spook to bring together a wide range of seemingly
individual 'coincidences' into a logical, coherent pattern.
  Clifden Albert Banner:
  Polly McWilliam's brother. A former B-52 bomber pilot with
connections to both the NuclearBomberAdulteress and the
ButtonBomberJoyRider provided the Flying Spook with his first
hard connection between the Author and Armed Forces personnel
suspected of having Circle of Eunuchs connections.
  Major Banner's military history working at top levels of
the Strategic Air Command, as well as with the Joint Chiefs
of Staff at the Pentagon provided the Flying Spook with an
immediate RedFlag that suggested even the remotest connectionYT
what would be found upon further investigation.
  It therefore came as no surprise to find that, after having
put in place a wide variety of possible co-conspirators within
the Armed Forces network, Major Banner retired to become a
Senior Engineering Specialist-Mission Planning System, in the
New England Operations Field Office of GDE Systems, a major
military contractor.
  Neither was it a surprise that Major Banner's specialty
  Jane Banner:
  Polly McWilliam's sister. Heavily involved as a programmer,
for Nortel, with highly sensitive work in an area of the
joint US/Chinese encryption program that was suspected to
have strong covert connections to the CypherPunks and the
Circle of Eunuchs.
  Earl David Banner:
  Polly McWilliam's father. A Boston Globe Journalist who had been privy to the most secret of secrets in a comprehensive
array of social circles ranging from the Roosevelts and the
Kennedys to Cardinal Cushing and the Lords of Lourdes.
  Earl Banner's Anglican heritage was in seeming contrast to
his Catholic connections until the Flying Spook discovered
the close connection between the Author's Catholic lineage
through the French Norris clan on his mother's side and the
Catholic lineage of the McWilliams clan to which Polly's
husband, Bob, was a vital link.
  Moyra Banner:
  Polly's McWilliam's mother. Grew up in Montreal and met
her future husband through  sources closely connected to
the Bartonian Metaphysical Society and what was later to
become the Solar Temple Cult--both of which were organizations
with close connections to the Author and David Humisky, a
shadowy figure who had stunned the Canadian Military by
engineering a quick end to a student military-game project
designed to provide information and data on the capability
of military neophytes engaging in spontaneous war games.
  Alan McKenzie:
  Polly McWilliams' great-grandfather. Driven with his family
from the Isle of Lewis, in Scotland, by the Laird, as a result
of his subversive political connections to a Welsh mining rebel
named Bennett, whose grandson, Leslie James Bennett, would rise
out of one of the 'Little Moscows' in South Wales, serving as
a bastion of the British Labour Party, to become the Chief of
the Russian Desk for the RCMP's Security Service, before beingYT
with connections to fellow Red Caspers McClean and Kim Philby.
  Terry Dee:
  A long-time friend and confidante of Bob and Polly McWilliams, as well as a shadowy presence in the life of
the Author's decade-long lover in Austin and Tuscon.
  The Flying Spook had originally researched his connection
to the Author as a result of Dee's work for various American
spook agencies during his travels in the Middle East, and
was stunned to discover the close links between Dee's
ancestors--the O'Days--and the Author's great-grandfather,
Clarence Day, whose progeny in Mountain Home, Idaho, once
again completed the Circle between the Author and Major Clif
Banner, as well as filling in the Author's connection to
the Naval Guided Missle School and a wide variety of
suspected Circle of Eunuchs initiates employed at sensitive
military and secret government laboratory sites around
the world.
  Merna Brown:
  The Author's first wife. A member of the Bartonian Metaphysical
Society, and whose father had proved to be a vital link in the
connection between the socialist New Democratic Party of Tommy
Douglas and the suspected Russian agent, James Leslie Bennett.
  Merna Brown had eventually turned up in Ontario in a government
position ideally suited for providing financial and personal
history support for a number of individuals drifting back and
forth between the Solar Temple, Elohim City, Waco and San Diego,
changing identities as they went.
  Dave Foreman:
  The Flying Spook found it interesting that the Author had
appeared to have absolutely no contact with Dave Foreman or
any of the Earth First subversives in Arizona during HisOrHer
time there, yet seemed to be involved in advising and training
a wide variety of those connected to Earth First in various
areas of the country, particularly in Northern California.
  Hidden deep within the mountains of files kept on those who
marched in protests at the LizardMore Lavoratory was a note
which attributed authorship of a song, "We're Going To Take
It Sitting Down," a banner tune for a Berkeley radical group
named La Palomas, to one C.J. Parker, who was also known to
have authored "Don't Blame Me, I Voted For The Monkey."
  Black Elk:
  Equally intriguing was the Author's close connection to a
wide variety of Rainbow Family members thoughout the US and
Canada. While the Author seemingly remained unaware of his
connection to the group, many of the Rainbow Family were notYT
enormous amount of covert support during his wide travels.
  ears of investigation failed to discover the link until
the Flying Spook engaged the Author in WarStories (TM) at
the CoalDust Saloon in Bienfait, and heard a tale about HimOrHer joining an oddball van full of misfits including
hippies, college athletes and a Catholic priest, on a trip
to a mountain top in Colorado to await the fulfillment of
the vision written of in "Black Elk Speaks."
  HeOrShe told of the Catholic priest smuggling an ounce of
hashish across the border, shoved up his butt, screwing the
Catholic girls on the trip, and then absolving them, and carrying a mountain of liquor up the mountain on his back,
a Herculean task which made him a legend among those at
the gathering who considered a spiritual journey to be
incomplete without a jigger of earthly spirits to ease
their passage.
  The Author told of rising in the middle of the night to
relieve himself of excess spirits and falling into one of
the slit-trench crappers that had been dug for the occassion,
swearing like a trooper as he climbed out, only to fall into
another, and yet another, with the whole gathering laughing
riotously in the dark at the Fool In The Stool, as he called
himself. He had little idea that not only did the whole
gathering know who he was the next day (even though he pretended ignorance of the whole affair), but that the story
of his folly had become one of the legends told by the
original members of the Rainbow Family which was born at
the gathering.
  Ken Sleight:
  Government efforts to investigate an alleged underground
railroad for a variety of outlaws, desperados and radicals,
including a trail of SafeHouses and HideOuts throughout
the western US, invariably led to one or another of passages
in and out of the Four Corners area.
  The Author and Utah outfitter Ken Slight were often found
to be operating in close proximity without ever seeming to
have confirmable direct contact. Interestingly, they both
seemed to have contact with a large number of the same
people involved in environmental and survivalist arenas,
including Bob Mason, of Durango, although under an assumed
  XS4ALL:
  InterNet Free Terra both hosted the banned website during
their censorship troubles with the the German government, and
helped a variety of other sites set up mirror sites around the
same time. One of the causes of XS4ALL's troubles was the
publication of how-to tips on derailing trains.
  Although it was confirmed that the Author's travel schedule
coincided with a number of railway 'accidents', including theYT
in the vicinity of Saskatoon, no positive links to HisOrHer
involvement could be established. The Flying Spook's recent
investigation, however, turned up the fact that a variety of
those hosting mirrors of the XS4ALL website had travel schedules which coincided with that of the Author at the
times of several railway 'accidents', although, once again,
no positive link between the individuals could be established.
  Time is a trick to keep suspicious minds from positively
connecting Taoist subversive criminal radicals to the events
for which they are obviously responsible.
  Space is a trick to keep Taoist subversive criminal radical
coconspirators from being positively linked together when it
is in the best interests of the government to claim that they
are acting alone.
  Paranoia is a trick to keep non-Taoist subversive criminal
radicals from realizing that most LEAs are real Lamers (TM),
and that the only thing one needs to be paranoid of is paranoia,
itself (it's a vicious cycle...).
  Guilt is a trick to keep psychotic sociopath subversive
criminal radicals from killing everyone at once, so that there
is still someone left to plot against them.
  The Bienfait Nutly News makes no pretensions of operating
as an ethical and responsible news source for individuals
whose cerebral synapse circuits remain unaffected by moon
phases and solar sunspot activity.
  We accept no responsibility for explaining how the translation of Reptilians In Black into an RIP acronym
can go unnoticed by the editor until the end of the piece,
or how a well-researched article can somehow seem to peter

  Hell, we don't even know what the right-square bracket

"The lives of Frank, Gambino, Morel and Serafini ended on the gallows of Montreal's Bordeaux Jail on October 24,
1924. Valentino and Davis had their executions commuted
at the last minute."
"No one claimed Frank, Gambino and Valentino were among
the half-dozen gunmen who ambushed the bank car, but
prosecutorn R.L. Calder argued they were still guilty of
murder because of the organized nature of the crime."
~Excerpts from "Blood Brothers" by Peter Edwards.
  MeTheSheeple was glad to learn that these vile, criminal
scumbags, fingered by the person who had actually planned
and committed the crime, were held accountable for the
actions alleged to them by the gang-leader whose life was
spared in return for ratting out alleged coconspirators.
  I was particularly happy because I knew that the same
high standards of justice would undoubtedly be applied to
the criminal scum within the Canadian Justice System under
whose PigSkin Umbrella the Montreal Mobsters ruled the
streets and the citizens who walked them.
"Testimony at the Frank robbery trial showed that police
routinely sipped coffee with hoods and that Montreal's
finest had been tipped off to the armoured car hold-up
well in advance, but did nothing."
  Supreme Court of Canada Justice Louise Coderre (with a
left-handed frog-tongue over the first 'e') said, "Vice
has spread itself across the city with an ugliness that
seemed assured of impunity."
  Rather than bore you with all of the details behind the
criminal scumbag PigsWithBadgesAndGuns being also found
'GUILT OF MURDER BECAUSE OF THE ORGANIZED NATURE OF THE
CRIME', I will just skip ahead in the book and report on
the final outcome of  JUSTICE in the case of the police and city officials discovered
to have greased the wheels of organized crime in their
activities of drug dealing, robbery, murder, etc.
  Hmmm....nope...nada....maybe...nope...nope...
  Surprise, surprise! It seems that, following the
Coderre probe, "nothing happened that seriously
threatened the criminals' take. The name of Cadiex Street was changed to de Bullion Street after a New
ork play made the old name notorious, but along the same pavement the same crimes continued."
  Those without my cynical psychological make-up will
undoubtedly be able to supply you with reasons as to
just why the local citizens felt extremely 'served and
protected' when they came to after being mugged and saw
the new street signs, however, I will merely take a short
break, here, have a good dump, and wipe my butt with yet
another page of the Criminal Code of Canada.
And Silk Badges..?:
"I know who the real public enemies are. But they are
men who have the respect of the public; men who wear
silk hats, who are apparently of standing in the ~1930's Montreal MobBuster, J.J. Penverne
 (with no frog-licks in his name...)
  Peter Edwards provides the standard journalistic
explaination as to how "The term 'Mafia,' in its truest
form, refers only to organized crime in western Sicily."
and explains how it has been expanded to encompass any
pair of teenagers throwing a rock through a window, as
long as one of them has an Italian name.
  He neglects to explain, as some journalists do, that
the word "Mafia" is becoming increasingly generic, now
including the 'Lebanese Mafia', the 'Columbian Mafia',
  *All* journalists, however, seem unable to explain why
they continue to avoid naming the continuing organized forces
of armed domination over citizens of *all* ethnic groups the
'Government Mafia'...
  "Blood Brothers" is not the first book to point out that
at the heart of the "honoured society of Calabria" lies the
concept of "omerta" (with a right-handed strand of spaghetti
over the 'a').
  Nor is it the first book to fail to point out that omerta's
"double code of conduct that set different moral codes for dealings with those inside and outside one's family circle"
applies not only to Officially Recognized Criminal ScumBag
Organizations, but also to almost every 'gang' larger than
a Cult Of One from the PTA to the CIA to the USA.   'Omerta' decrees that when the president of the PTA molests
a child, when the head of the CIA commits treason, when the
president of the USA declares that US citizens will continue
to face imprisonment for exporting the same strength of
encryption that their government is sharing with Communist
China, that a street somewhere be renamed, while everything
else continues on pretty much as before.
  Don't hold your breath waiting for mainstream journalists
to upset the BadAppleCart by referring to the 'PTA Mafia' when they deem that your child should be forced to attend school with
a child who can murder them by biting them, while teaching
them that you are a dangerous psycho because of your gun
ownership; or to the 'FBI Mafia' when they murder a mother and
child in attempts to cover their previous unannounced, botched
armed assault on a citizen being charged with civil crimes in
an attempt to persuade him to invent crimes against his friends,
whether they were Jewish or not; or to the 'Government Mafia'
when they spend millions of dollars investigating and/or charging
Phil Zimmerman, Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Jim Bell, knowing that
the bottomless taxpayer pockets funding their legally unjustified
harassment will guarantee at least moderately successful results,
even if the end result is dropping the matter when the multi-
million dollar stench begins blowing back toward DC.
  Do not expect mainstream journalists to refer to the 'ASPCA
Mafia' when they release a hastily composed 'history' of TruthMongrel as a rabid, sharp-toothed, human baby conniseur,
after HeOrShe is cut down by FBI gunfire on Mayonaisse Mountain
during attempts to arrest the Author on 'Dog At Large' charges
filed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Bienfait, Sask.
Silk? We Don't Need No Stinking Silk...:
  The multi-facted PigsEar WebSites that are increasingly
being turned into InterNet Cult of One SilkPurses through
the increasingly efficient and powerful shareware digital
bread-slicers available to Jane and Joe Sheeple in their
quest to serve either God, Mammon, Dog or Mammy, according
to their prediliction, have the capacity, if uncensored and uncontrolled, of allowing the individual to rekindle
the creative spark of individuality that reminds them that
the word 'WE' should only be used by Kings, Priests, and
people with tapeworms.
  People with the ability to think for themselves; people
who know that if Timothy McVeigh was really the 'Muenster'
that the mainstream media claimed, then he would have been

Monica Lewinski has a 'bent' pussy; people with conspiring
minds, who want to 'snow'; people who are not afraid to
stand up and cheer for the Officially Recognized BadGuys
on 'Cops' and 'World's Scariest Innocent Bystander

BUMBO RATING - One Prick Up
BumBoy Interview: C-J VAN DAMNNED
 A candied conversation with CyberSpace's most understood
 FUD Disseminator whose BadForgeries under the auspices of
 the Electronic Forgery Foundation have thus far failed to
 trick anyone but Adam Back and Alec McCrackin into being
 initiated by the Author into the mythical Circle of Eunuchs
{  It was a scene from a Film Blanc as AnInterviewerToBe-
  NamedLater was met at the door of the TrojanSafeHouse by
  a TruthMongrel wearing White Lipstick and no panties.
   It was immediately obvious that Blanc Weber's attempts
  to deflect the Author's obsession with her by forging
  love-letters to HimOrHer, purporting to be from Carol
  AnnaChrist CypherPunk, had not only failed miserably,
  but had also resulted in tremendous psychological trauma
  to Baby, who continually interrupted the BumBoy Interview
  by dropping a BadBillyG mask at the Author's feet, and
  backing towards him with her tail lifted.
   When asked about the vile-colored discharge coming from
  TruthMongrel's rear area, the Author merely mumbled an
  unintelligible statement about 'A tribute to Lucky Green'
  and forced a couple of antibotic pills down her throat
  with his penis.
   AnInterviewerToBeNamedLater, finding the door had locked
  behind her, quickly sat down and started her tape recorder
  before holding tightly onto the edges of her chair with
  both hands and attempting to smile as if nothing was wrong.}
BUMBO: I guess I should start by asking you for the True
Story (TM) behind the Legendary CypherPunks Moderation/
Censorship Experiment.
VAN DAMNNED: The True Story (TM), never before told, is that
the CypherPunks Censorship Crisis, which, incidentally, has
the same acronym (current CypherPunks Word of the Week) as
the Canadian Criminal Code, was, in reality, an attempt to
forcefully remove me from the CypherPunks Classic Mailing
List, after which the mailing list was scheduled to return
to normal, much along the lines of the NewCoke-ClassicCoke
BUMBO: Declan McCullagh, a MainDream journalist with the
Netly News, and a media shill for Time Magazine, who was
the first false profit to announce 'The Death of the
CypherPunks', reported that the controversy began over the
forced unsuscbriving of Dr. Dimitri Vulis, KOTM as a result
of his relentless spamming of the CypherPunks Classic
Mailing List. Are you suggesting that Declan is a lying piece
of crap?
VAN DAMNED: ou don't understand...
There *is*no* Declan...there *is*no* Dimitri.
BUMBO: Well bend me over, and call me Mary...are you serious?
VAN DAMNNED: Fucking eh! Excuse me, but that's an old Canadian
TouretTic saying...
Believe me, I was as surprised as you are when I first began to suspect that the CypherPunks Classic Mailing List had at
its heart the classic scent of a dark, hidden conspiracy.
At first I thought it was part of the WorldWidePlot (TM) against
me by Gomez and the Dark Allies, but I later discovered it to be the work of a lone gunman, operating from behind the grass
grown on the knoll known as Mayonaisse Mountain.
BUMBO: Timothy C. May?
VAN DAMNNED: If that is his *real* name...
BUMBO: Are you sure you're not full of shit and just trying
to distract me while you try to peek up my skirt to see if
I'm wearing any panties?
VAN DAMNNED: Those are two separate issues...
Actually, my underlover investigation, with Baby on top,
eventually revealed that Tim May is a senile, grouchy old
fart whose redneck, racist cynicism resulted in him being
shunned by every decent, law-abiding, moral person on the
InterNet, and he single-handedly began the CypherPunks
Classic Mailing List by assuming the personas of a variety
of alleged founders of the list, including Gilmore, Hughes,
et al.
TCM's original plan was to create a mystique around the list
which would draw others into his sticky PreWorldWideWeb and
result in his being able to twist the minds of others with
his criminal, anarchistic beliefs. Over the years, however,
the lack of response by others on the InterNet forced him
to invent such a wide variety of CypherPunks Consistent
Net Personas (TM) that he eventually went mad, identifying
with each and every persona and subconsiously fearing the
intrusion of 'outsiders' into the CypherReality that he
had created.
BUMBO: And he managed to maintain the illusion all of these years?
VAN DAMNNED: es. As hard as it is to believe, little Timmy
Mayonnaise, a sorry, pathetic loser whose CyberLoneliness
drove him to madness, is solely responsible for the prodigious
output of the CypherPunks over the years. BlackNet, Remailers,
HashCash, StrangleHold and Comanche software...
BUMBO: Are you saying that Sameer, Ian Goldberg, Peter Trei,
Matt Blaze, Lance Cottrell, et al, don't exist?
VAN DAMNNED: Never have, never will.
BUMBO: And Sandy SandFart?
VAN DAMNNED: The best-kept-secret in CypherPunks CyberHistory
is that *I* am Sandy SandFart.
BUMBO: Get out of here...
VAN DAMNNED: OK, I'm leaving...
BUMBO: No, you fucking idiot...that's just an expression!
VAN DAMNNED: Oh...sorry...
Anyway, the whole CypherPunks Censorship Crisis (not to be
confused with the Canadian Criminal Code), began when I
innocently joined the CypherPunks Classic Mailing List,
believing it to be real. Tim May at first believed that
I was just another one of his invented personas, but he
inadvertantly stumbled upon documentation that I was
actually a separate individual, and thus a threat to the
CypherReality that he had so painstakingly created over
the years.
When I began to realize that my existence as an actual
person was creating problems on the list, due to my
post mathematically proving that I had broken PGP having
mysteriously failed to show up on the CypherPunks list,
I quickly changed my NetPersona to an imaginary being
known as Toto, but the mental infirmities that prevented
me from maintaining a Consistent CypherPunks Net Persona
made it a useless exercise in redundant uselessness.
Timothy C. May, under his John Gilmore persona, announced
the forceful unsribiving of another of his CypherPunks
personas, Dimitri Vulis, with the intention of having the
CypherPunks Classic Mailing List moderated/censored by
an entity introduced as Sandy SandFart.
  Recognizing TCM's clever ruse, I blindsided his devious
plan by assuming the role of Sandy SandFart on the list,
forcing little Timmy into a schizoid break during which
he withdrew from the CypherPunks list as Tim C. May,
while subconsiously maintaining his other personas.
BUMBO: This is getting too weird... Do you have any actual
*proof* of all this?
VAN DAMNNED: Think about it...
When did pouting little Timmy return to the list?
After 'Toto' posted a message to the list, with the
bedlam to the point where it broke the PGP-encrypted
brainwaves holding apart his separate CypherPunks Consistent Net Personas, and he reached a level where
he was 'Hun With Everything', including Attila.
BUMBO: Uuhhh...are you starting to 'lose it'?
VAN DAMNNED: Must be time to take my medication. Let's put
a right-square bracket in and continue this interview after
I suck up the pills I stashed up TruthMongrel's twat...]

{ AnInterviewerToBeNamedLater, though sickened by the totally
  disgusting display of oral sodomy committed by the Author
  on the SingleInnocentChildDog, Baby, NunTheLess held her
  tight grip on the edges of her chair, keeping her knees
  together to thwart the depraved bastard from discovering
  whether or not she was wearing panties, and fulfilled her
  obligation to BUMBO to provide a completed interview in
  return for the drugs she had received as an advance}
BUMBO: How did you finally confirm your suspicions as to
Tim C. May being the only real subscriber to the CypherPunks
Classic Mailing List?
VAN DAMNNED: I reverse-engineered the Perl Beer script that
Ignoramous ChewedOff, that dickless prick, sent to the list,
explaining that it could be used to create forged posts from
allegedly real Net Personas.
Actually, I was trying to use the program to forge messages
to the list, but I was stinking fucking drunk, and the next
thing you know, EveryThing became EverClear.
BUMBO: ou have...uuhhh...*something* sticking to your upper lip...
VAN DAMNNED: Trade you a green one for a yellow one...
BUMBO: Quit trying to peek up my goddamn skirt!
VAN DAMNNED: Sorry, I can't help myself...
Anyway, although the results of the reverse-engineering of
Tim May's CommieSchill CypherPunks Consistent Net Persona,
Ignoramous, proved my previously perceived preponderance
of proof to be proven, it also revealed the presence of
a second gunman lurking in the gunsmoke from the seedless
grass behind the knoll on Mayonnaise mountain, even though
at first it didn't make any SenseToMeA.
BUMBO: JohnBob Hettinga-oung?
VAN DAMNNED: Exactly.
I had long suspected that Hettinga and oung were the same
person, due to their Consistent CypherPunks Net Personas
undergoing parallel degeneration into semi-coherent mad
ramblings similar to those experienced by TruthMonger when
I ran short of medications.
At first, I suspected they were two separate individuals
with the same drug connection, but when I made the final
connection between Hettinga-oung and Kent Crispin, it
became obvious that the 'Spooks' alleged to be operating
in the background of the CypherPunks Classic Mailing List
were actually only a single 'Spook', who, upon subversively
joining the CypherPunks list as an undocumentable persona
capable of sneaking in under Tim May's ever watchful, paranoid
eyes, fell prey to TCM's madness, developing a wide variety
of Consistent CypherPunks Net Spook Personas.
BUMBO: What gave rise to the CypherPunks Disturbed Male
VAN DAMNNED: Previous to the Legendary CypherPunks Moderation/
Censorship Experiment/Crisis, little Timmy Mayonnaise's inability to reconcile his masculine and feminine sides resulted
in his few Female CypherPunks Consistent Net Personas being
incapable of balancing the strong male presence represented by
the majority of the CypherPunks personas he had created.
In order to prevent his extreme homophobia from destroying the
balance of the CypherTao, he was forced to personify it as
Dr. Dimitri Vulis, KOTM, publically accusing all of TCM's
other CypherPunks personas of being 'cocksuckers'. This enabled
the other personas, chiefly John Gilmore, to manifest the parts
of TCM's disturbed psyche that were warring against his feminine
side, threatening to prevent his continued residency in NewAge
California under the watchful eyes of Gloria Steinham clones.
Once little Timmy had reconciled his masculine side with his
feminine side, by listening to C.J. Parker's 'Song For Rose (I'll
Give ou My Heart But My Dick Belongs To Momma)', he felt more
comfortable wearing his Freudian Slip, and his CypherPunks
personas began to break up into sub-groups with lives of their
His Jim Choate persona runs the Austin CypherPunks Node, with
the Einstein/Genius sub-personality peacefully coexisting with
the Feminine/Hysteria sub-personality that flipped out when Toto
violated Choate's identity by forging a post to the list in the WEBeastMaster's name.
His Commie Schill persona, Igor, runs the Algebra/Semantics
CypherPunks Node, with Igor's understanding of the similarities
between the strict logic of mathematics and the flowing music
of semantics making up for Tim's inability to understand the
connection between Comrade Lenin and John Lennon, or why the
sound of a Volkswagon engine was so hard to dance to.
Lance Cottrel's InfoNextStep CypherPunks Node secretly funded
by Steven BlowJobs, acts as a release valve for TCM's remaining
homophobic repressions, allowing him to justify his anal-
penetration fantasies by imagining that he is being victimized
by manly Nazis while trapped under the snowmobile that flipped
over while racing across the tundra, while still punishing
himself by the pain that results at night, when the ice-weasels
Joichi Ito (a play-on-words referring to Pearl Harbor
Computer's motto, "We Don't Eat [Ito] [Sushi] Dogs") as
the TCM sub-personality running the CypherNip Node, allows
TCM to indulge the S&M Bondage fantasies which are a prerequisite for buying land in NewAge California, while
telling himself that he's not *really* a fucking weirdo,
because he is only binding his feet.
BUMBO: And TCM's blatant redneck racism?
VAN DAMNNED: The Japanese CypherPunks Disturbed Male Node was
one of TCM's subconsious creations, designed to balance his
round-eyed, redneck imperialist side with the suppressed
slant-eyed gook in his California NewAge CosmicMakeUp.
Serious students of secular semantics soon saw that the
'Chop-chop' insults hurled by Tim May at his suppressed
errowMenace CyphelPunks Consistent Net Pelsonas were actually a pidgen-English variation on a red-white-and-blue/
stars-and-stripes Harley Davidson phrase, 'Chopper-Chopper'.
BUMBO: Uuhhh...it's getting a little deep. Is it medication
time again?
VAN DAMNNED: Think about it...
David Formosa, AKA ? the Platypus. It was an early sign of
the Chinc within struggling to get out, yet having to adopt
an Australian alias because TCM was not yet ready to face
butchering the English language without the excuse of being
drunk, or a victim of an imaginary disease named agraphia,
which was developed in a secret underground lavoratory by
Kent Crispin, who was desperately trying to keep Tim May
from consciously transposing his 'r's and 'l's, and realizing
that Pearl Harbor Computer's motto, "We don't eat dogs." was
not a reference to the disgusting dietary habits of Orientals,
but a veiled reference to the Reptilian Nazis who sated their
unnatural, carnal cuisenary desires by disguising themselves
as alligators crawling out of the Florida swamps to savagely
savour the sumptuous PuppyFlesh of TruthMongrel's distant
cousins, the FrenchConnection Poodles, whose heroin habits
were a survival mechanism designed to make them comfortably
numb as the Reptilian Nazis dined on their gonads, long
considered a delicacy by Space Aliens across the Universe,
turning them into Circle Of Eunuchs DoggieInitiates just
like Baby TruthMongrel, who was a Bitch trapped in a
Stud's body before being interrogated as a suspected member
of the Magic Circle by Gomez's Soviet dwarf, Hobbit uri
Kokoff? the Platypus, who was the inspiration for Tim May's
David 'The Australian Chinc' Formosa Consistent CypherPunks
Net Persona, completing the Magic Circle that began as a
defensive mechanism to thwart the Dark Forces that arise
every time that a Unix system is booted, releasing Daemons,
Zombies, Orphan Zombies, and the Dreaded Cron, enabling
students to face these imaginary creations of their drug-
addled minds with the comforting support of an equally
nonexistent creation by a mentally disturbed FrostBack
who bought into the drug-induced, Berzerkely Dungeons
and Dragons fantasies resulting from secret digital implants
into the brains of Bell Labs employees by Bill Gates in order
to promote his less versatile DOS Operating System as a safe
alternative to a Unix Operating System proliferating in the Bay Area, dangerously within reach of the Dark Forces in Oakland who were a threat to property values, in sharp contrast
to the safety of Redmond, Washington, where BadBillyG's secret
lover, Blanc Weber, kept the Dark Forces within the Author's
mind at bay, by resisting HisOrHer efforts to psychically peek up her skirt, to see if she was wearing panties.

BumBoy Interview: C-J VAN DAMNNED (will it never end?)
{ AnInterViewerToBeNamedLater, sucking medication out of
  Baby's twat, only to find that it was a surprisingly
  pleasureable experience, made the mistake of allowing
  the Author to continue the interview on his own, while
  she and the TruthMongrel engaged in behavior that even
  the disgusting perverts on the BumBoy staff found to
  be revolting, since it was being done by two females.}
VOICES: "Tell them about US..."
VAN DAMNNED: It's not always voices...sometimes it's dreams...
sometimes the TV, or the Radio, or...anything, really...
Like the dream where I'm in the front row at a prizefight,
and two guys are beating the living shit out of each other,
until the final bell sounds and the winner is declared.
Then the two guys get out of the ring and come after me. The
one wearing the elephant-colored boxing trunks holds me down
while the one wearing the donkey-colored trunks starts shoving
a large box up my asshole, and pieces of paper fall out, giving
me papercuts, until one of the pieces of paper cuts my throat
as I puke it out, and the two guys who pretended to be fighting
each other are sucking up my blood out of the trough at the edge of the boxing ring, which turns out to be a pig-pen.
As the last of my lifeblood drains out of me, a person in
a dirty white smock appears, saying, "I'm from the government,
and I'm here to help you." As the person places the piece of
paper that cut my throat onto my juglar vein, to stop the bleeding, I notice that it is an election ballot--it is *my* election ballot.
As the ambulance rushes me back to my office, to return to
work, with the attendants telling me I should be back to normal
in about forty months, the two boxers walk past me, arm in
arm, with two sinister-looking agents walking behind them,
discussing their 'fighters' rematch, four years hence.
They have decided to raise the price of tickets from $100.00
to $500.00, since the government automatically deducts it
from everyone's paycheck, whether they attend the 'fight'
or not. As they discuss how much to raise the concession
prices for beer, soda, peanuts, popcorn and hot dogs, they
seem to suddenly notice me, and stop to offer their sincere
condolences for my 'accident', and say that they hope it
won't prevent me from attending the rematch.
As if on cue, the fight-promoter, who tells me he is from
the government, and is here to help me, picks up a pig-turd
containing a small piece of the hot-dog I was eating when I
was sodomized by the boxers, and hands it to me, saying, "This
is your share of the 'take'. ou know, in Communist countries,
the government keeps it all..."
I don't think I'll attend the rematch. I have a feeling that
I already know who wins...and who loses...
VOICES: "ou're getting excited again. Why don't you take your
medicine, and read a book, or something, to calm you down?"
VAN DAMNNED: ou sadistic pricks, you *know* that the only book I have with me is Collier and Horowitz's, 'The KENNEDS,
AN AMERICAN DRAMA,' and it's not in the least bit entertaining,
since I just finished a book about the Mafia, so I know how
everything in the Kennedy book, or *any book on politics, is going to turn out even before the authors even finish writing about it.
It's even more depressing than reading Hitler's "Mein Kamf" and
"New World Order" and then reading mainstream press reports about
government news conferences. Doesn't anybody do 'original material'
any more, or is everyone just plagarizing President Henny oungman,
who said, "Take my citizens...please!"
And take them...and take them...and take them...
VOICES: "We *told* you that everything since the Big Bang has
been plagarism..."
VAN DAMNNED: Oh, yeah? What about my song, "Booger-Eating Dog
(Don't Bite The Nose That Feeds ou)," or, "I Was Sitting On
My Horse, And She Jerked Me Off," and all of the other sick,
depraved songs I've written? Do you see a big lineup of people
claiming credit for the lyrics?
VOICES: "ou're getting excited again. See, you even placed your
quote marks in the correct place..."
VAN DAMNNED: See, there is another thing that proves that people
are capable of original, independent thought and actions...
Just because I'm the Author doesn't mean I have to use correct
spelling, punctuation, syntax (whatever the hell that is), or
write in a manner that indicates a well-researched and well-
reasoned train of thought. VOICES: "That doesn't make you unique, you fucking imbecile.
Just ask any one of a thousand publishing editors who have
to wade through the mountains of trash sent to them by self-
declared 'authors' who eventually end up cashing in Andy
Warhol's IOU for 'Fifteen Minutes Of Fame' by becoming a
guest on the Jerry Springer Show and telling the whole world
about how they got their dog pregnant by sucking themselves
off and blowing their sperm up her twat."
VAN DAMNNED: That wasn't *me*! That was someone who just
looked like me and deposited Jerry Springer's check in my
bank account to make me look bad.
But I don't mind, because it makes me unique!
VOICES: "Everything since the BigBang is Plagarism. ou're just
like all the other Sheeple."
VAN DAMNNED: No! ou're trying to trick me into thinking that
I'm not a free, independent human being. ou're trying to take
away the only things I have to hold on to that make me unique. ou want me to believe that I am not the only sick, depraved
pervert in the world who spreads FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Disinformation) in an attempt to cloak my evil, wretched life
in an aura of grandoise importance and imagined righteousness.
VOICES: "ou haven't been following the Clinton-Lewinski affair
in the news, have you?"
VAN DAMNNED: Shut up! I'm not listening! I AM *NOT* LIKE PRESIDENT CLINTON!!!
I did *not* give strong encryption to those Chinese people who
let me have my way with Buddy in the Lincoln bedroom before they
ate him. I'm the one who tried to expose the fact that the *real*
Buddy had been replaced by a cross-cloning of Spuds Mackenzie and
Janet Reno. I told the CypherPunks to draw glasses on a picture
of Buddy and see if it looked like Reno.
That was *me*, *really*! I just forged Mark Hedges name to that
post to make him look like an asshole! Honest!
VOICES: "ou're just like all of the other sorry, pathetic losers
who can't get a *real* publishing contract with a *real* publisher
who is helping to destroy the Rain Forests by printing millions of
hardcover and paperback books decrying the destruction and loss of the Rain Forests.
"Instead, you continue to contribute to the destruction of the
Digital Environment by sending mountains of your rotting, greasy
Digital SPAM to the CypherPunks Disturbed Male List, where your
sins are compounded in MeatSpace as a result of the millions of
plastic  keys that need to be created every day in order
for decent, moral, law-abiding NetiZens to protect themselves and
their children from your mindless drivel.
"As punishment, WE are going to tell you the *real* name of the
right-hand square bracket..."
VAN DAMNNED: Noooo!!! I'M NOT LISTENING!!!
{The BumBoy Interview with C-J VAN DAMNNED came to a sudden end,
 as heavily armed, black-clad ninja agents of ACypherNipsNode-
 ToBeNamedLater, came bursting through the door, screaming,
 "Torah! Torah! Torah! Chop! Chop! ", surrounding the
 Author and allowing AnInterviewerToBeNamedLater to grab Baby
 and the tape recorder, making her escape while clutching her skirt
 close to her body, as the Author was trying to peek up it even
 as he lie on the floor taking a tremendous beating.
 "ou've got to admire his persistence." she told BumBoy editors
 while dropping off the interview tapes.
 Sadly, we must report that Baby, obviously a codependent enabler
 of the Author's sickness, failed to make it to California, where
 BumBoy was prepared to foot the bill for her to see a Doggie
 Therapist, instead choosing to return to the Author, once again
 dropping the BadBillyG mask at HisOrHer feet and backing toward
 him with her tail raised in eager anticipation.
 Redoubtable sources inform us that the black-clad ninja agents
 of ACypherNipsNodeToBeNamedLater sat back, drinking the Author's
 Scotch and enjoying the spectacle, as well as tucking money in
 the Author's panties when HeOrShe bound Baby's feet for the
 second performance.
 Official Police Reports indicate that, when officers arrived in
 response to noise complaints from the neighbors, that the ninjas
 were fighting violently over a Din-Din Tin roasting pan and a
 bottle of barbeque sauce, seemingly surprised that the Author  and Baby TruthMongrel had vanished.
 The leader of the black-clad ninja agents was quoted as saying,
 "Shit! We come to Ito his dog, and now we have to go home and
 Ito mole of his SPAM, instead." Turning to his companions, he
 said, "We go now...chop-chop!"
 Looking embarassed, the leader explained to police, "We not  even know what that mean, until oul fliend, Timmy-San, point
 us to the alchives, whele we find out it mean we have big
 cocks, rike Amelican bikels. Then we aporogized fol accusing
 Timmy-San of making fun of us. He good guy..."
 The editors at BumBoy, upon receiving Declan McCullagh's  expense receipts for the clothing he purchased to go undercover
 as AnInterviewerToBeNamedLater, could not help but notice that
 an article of clothing conspicuously missing from the receipts
 was...panties.}

In defense of my rudimentary rudeness in replying ridiculously to
a perfectly reasonable and seemingly serious question, I must admit
that my intentions to provide an equally serious response to the
question above were thwarted by the intervention of a HigherPower-
CapableOfSquaringTheShitOutOfJason, in a process providing pretty
persuasive proof that the CranialConsipiracyCrapola I am about
to provide for your non-racist, but nevertheless discriminating,
mind, is nothing more nor less than as honest and direct anwer to
your question as I am capable of giving, given the grandoise nature
of the nature of the claim I am about to stake claim to, not as a
Wooden Indian nor a Vampire, but simply one who is driven by Forces
of Light and Darkness that are not only beyond my Ken to understand,
but also beyond the Barbie Wired to the MeatSpace Manifestation of
the magazine which was ultimately responsible for my ultimately
sending my intimate informational infatuations with CypherPunks
Issues, whether digital or organic, to the Disturbed Male LISP.
In short, it is those depraved motherfuckers at Wired Magazine who
must ultimately be held responsible for my continued spamming of
a SingleInnocentCypherPunk (TCM-aka Bill Helm-RadiationMan III,
Forever Hettinga, Politician Lefty Frissel, ChevyBlazer FloorMatt,
and Peter SonOfTheSumOfOneAndTuTuBeNamedLater.)
  The True Story (TM) of why I originally subscribed to the CPUNX Cardinal & Ms. Spelling LISP has been confirmed by the
Nine UnKnowing to be the result of a subconscious desire to
destroy the Band of Mary Anarchists by forcing them to band
together, forming a well-organized and tightly-knit political
organization dedicated to eliminating me from both DigitalSpace
and MeatSpace. In draw-string shorts, to yank the CPUNKS cotton chains and expose their private parts in a manner that
would leave no doubt about the fact that the Magic Circle of
WhiteLipstick around all of the 'members' provides postive
proof of the accuracy of Dr. Dimitri Vulis, KOTM's contention
that Nun of the CypherPunks were born female, and that they
are not, in fact, Anarchists, but merely LostBoys from Lost
Alamo who are alone in the world because they cannot accept
the diagnosis of Dr. Stephan Goodman, who theorizes that
they are "men who love men, every now and then," to whom the
phrase, 'blow it out your ass', has more meaning than it does
for most people.
[Spin Editor: What the Author *meant* to say, is that, as a
 result of being the subject of Direct Electrical Shock Radio  Experiments during his youth, he soon learned that, unless
 others in the room were gathered around the radio, the
 correct answer to the question, "Do you hear Voices?" is
 an emphatic "Nope! Not me...nosiree, Bob. Nope...not me!"]
What the Spin Editor *meant* to say, is that my early
exposure to the True Agenda (TM) of the MindPolice left
little doubt in my mind (little of practically *anything*,
actually) that one's career as a TruthMonger would allow
them to keep their head longer with a 'CourtJester
alias, than as "AnneBolyne particularly if the
name of the person saying "I'd just like to ask you a few
questions." is OffWithSir Head, or who holds a position
titled 'Head Doctor' in a non-medical surgical facility.
To make a short story long, with a bend in the middle, Dog
spoke to me in a Stream piped through the fillings in my
teeth, and told me that there was one who would come before
me, to prepare my way, who would be a 'voice lying in the
wilderness', telling the masses, "I am a messenger for one
who will come after me, who is (a) greater (bullshitter) than
I, sent by Dog to sniff the rear parts of the front-men posing
as wolves, in wolves clothing, who say 'What big teeth I have...
the better to make you render unto Ceasar, that which you
mistakenly thought was yours."
Long before the Starr appeared over DC, I knew that the Virgin
Birth of William Lewinski would never have taken place if there
had not been no room for burning the double-negatives in the Ovulate Office which told the True Story (TM) of what had taken
place in the Lincoln bedroom as a result of a sexual Jones that
the King of the Juice could not satisfy, no matter how large
a vein he punctured in women, or vice versa, with his dirty Upon purchasing a copy of the Wired Magazine edition which had
the Jasons of CypherSpace on the front cover, with an article
accompanying it which I did not bother to read, instinctively knowing that their Goal was to XOR the Net, so that after
Jesus Saves, Louis Freeh would not be able to put in the
rebound, yanking a man's parole as a result of Space Alien FUD
indicating he had participated in the VirtualNuclearBombing
of pubic buildings eleven KILLometers from MongerItaVille.
Knowing that, even though "Ignorance is no excuse." in the 'ayes'
of a Rigged Justice System, it is better to remain silent than to
speak up and remove all doubt as to one's guilt, I merely glanced
through the copy of Wired sufficiently to confirm the Marshall
Dillon theory that smoking guns doesn't kill people, the
Message kills people, or, more accurately, that the Department
of Justice people covering up the INSLAW affair killed those on
the List of Adrian Messenger, and then put the magazine away
in DeepThroatStorage until Dog, the only Horse I ever bet on
(although I have shot a lot of Horse over the years, sometimes
on the basketball court, sometimes in a seedy alley behind the
GreyHound Computer Buss Station), gave me a No Smoking Gun sign,
with the election of a Wise Man who rose from the dead three
times, as LazerAss Long (cousin of Johnny Wadd), drinking cold
HeinleinKin, playing the SexAPhone at $4.99/minute, running up
the WhiteHouse phone bill and the Federal Deficit, and making
such outstanding use of BlatantLies that his Pole rose in the
Polls at a rate that astounded even Poles named Lewinski, leading me to realize that, had I, like Marlo Branded, the Rifleman on the grassy knoll, despite my reputation as a traitorous, lying coward, followed my instincts and run for President of the United States of America, "I could'a been a contend'a..."
My point, if I may be so Bold (although without Italics, having
never been to Sicily) to state it plainly (without extra cheese),
is that Lucky Green is a fucking idiot...
He is such an ignorant, Robotically Programmed Sheeple, incapable of free, independent thought, that the only possible
way to accurately impress upon you his total devoidness (coming
soon to a dictionary near you) of hope in ever truly understanding
the concepts of True Freedom, Liberty and the Pursuit of Felony
Happiness, can be illustrated only by sharing with you the
"True Story (TM) of TruthMangler", Penguin Books, FrostBack
  'The True Story of the InterNet' when stripped of all of the
grandoise, pretentious, mystical FUD surrounding its artificial
dissemination across HyperSpace, can be summarized by quoting
"All My Lies Are True", by Carroll.
  "All my lies are true.
   And everything I do, I really am."
Believe it or not, Ripley, that's all there is... That's the
whole fucking poem. In the end, that's all there really is
to say.
Upon receiving an email from AnInterViewerToBeNamedLater, who
was named earlier, in the 'BumBoy III' chapter of Space Aliens
Hide My Drugs (which, correctly, should also have single quotes
around the title), I was quite prepared to write a short, simple
response to the question, "So what prompted you to start writing those missives to cypherpunks?"
As always, the fillings in my teeth convinced Reality to become
a participant in an Intervention program designed to thwart my
efforts to continue the heavy drug-use enabling me to be 'normal'
and 'saved' me from sanity by using the TV program, '60 Minutes',
to embody The Voice (TM) coming from the BurningBush, calling
for a "New World Order", reminding me that the BurningBush in
the bunker outside of Berlin was a clever ruse, later to become
a 'play on words' in a Braun Shaver advertising campaign that
referred to a 'close shave', to disguise the fact that it is
the AdamAntartic that holds the key to FrostBack Musicians
embedding hints in their music in regard to the Reptilian
Nazis biding their time, emerging from Florida puddles to
dine on the gonads of FrenchConnection Poodles, leading me to
realize that I forgot to mention how my insanity illustrates Lucky Green's ignorance.
(But, before I return to that subject, I should take the time
to explain that this disjointed '60 Minutes' diatribe refers
to the fact that my efforts at a 'direct reply' to D.M. Stihl's
question was interrupted by a sychronicitious eruption from
The Tube ("Watch me and I'll bleed you, 'Cause you eat the
shit I feed you") during which Leslie Stahl (not to be confused
with the chainsaw with a similar name), presented a piece called
'The Rumor Mill', in which she ignored the attempts of InterNet
Magazine's Edwin Cantor (?) to explain that the Freedom Of The
InterNet was a Healing Force capable of returning HumanKind to
a Wholistic State wherein we use our minds to discriminate between FUD (Fear/Uncertainty/Disinformation), MUD (Mind/
Uniformity/Disinformation) and CRUD (Conscious Realists
Using Discrimination), thereby forcing the InterNet User/
Consumer to actually Think (TM) before accepting any of
the information that is pulled, prodded or pushed into the
range of their perceptive attention...
Hang on a second, I lost my train of thought...
Oh, yeah! Anyway, Leslie Stahl, desperately attempting to
maintain the illusion that MainStream Lies piped through
the OfficialNewsStream are preferable to Non-Officially-
Recognized-Lies on J. Orlin Grabbe's 'World's 50 Greatest Conspiracies' website, subliminally inserted the bent logic
of the pricks in DC, using words such as Junk/Regulation/
OnLinePoliceMan(no mention of toilet plungers...go figure)/
Fuck completing that train of thought! 'BadInformation' implies
that the Freedom To Choose To Believe BadInformation does not
exist, and that NetiZens, like CitiZens, are all Sheeple who
need the people from the government, who are here to help us,
to step in and regulate/legislate which BadInformation will be
magically transformed into Reality by blessing it with the
Random Thought That MayOrMayNot Apply Question: "Who was not happy to see the Prodigal Son return?"
Answer: "The fatted calf."
My point is this: "Penned cattle have been found to gain as
much weight when fed a combination of drugs, shredded newspaper
and animal excrement, as when fed whole grains."
Therefore, it is not in the best interests of the ProfitMongers
to feed us the Truth, and, CitiZen or NetiZen, it is in our own
best interest, when we meet the Bubba on the road, to kill him.)
[Idioter's Note: Good prosecutors, recognizing the limited
 attention span of the spawn of pawns of modern civilization,
 due to being force-fed ten-second sound-bytes, and hyphenated
 words designed to evoke emotive responses rather than logical
 thought processes, would have long ago begged the Court Of
 Public Opinion for a short recess, in order to allow the
 Readers/Jurors time to grab a bite to eat, suck down a cold
 beer or two, and engage in sexual fantasies about their
 fellow jurors.
 However, the Author plans to proceed, uninterrupted, even
 though HeOrShe risks once again letting the SAHMD manuscript
 fall into semi-coherent mad ramblings, since HeOrShe realizes
 that, if the Reader has not yet learned to order Pizza, Beer,
 and AMasseuseToBeMaimedLater before undertaking the burdensome
 task of reading the True Story manuscripts, then they are most
 likely a goddamn Republican, anyway, with little hope of ever
 truly understanding a missive meant to manipulate their mind
 toward a realistic, non-discriminatory political point of view
 which can only be understood by Democrats who are willing to
 sit in the back of the bus with niggers and spics, although
 they inevitably shit their pants and jump back on the bus
 if one of those thieving fucking darkies happens to get off
 at the same stop as they do.*
 *This racist interlude is a paid advertisement, sponsered by
  Democratic Friends of the Kluless Klux Klan.
 Anyway, I have forgotten where this aside was going, but I
 just remembered I was attempting to get back to explaining
 how my derision of Lucky Green is, in reality, a veiled
 reference to my own idiocy, so I will do that...]
I was devestated when Lucky Green, wearing a Prozac T-Shirt,
while I, on the other hand, had a pocket full of Prozac, told
me, "I read 'The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre', but I didn't
understand what it was about."
I was devastated as a result of realizing that Lucky was nothing
more nor less than a mindless, robotic result of the *new*
generation of programmed, robotic Sheeple. I was devastated
because Lucky was a reminder that, despite my great pretensions
of being an anarchistic, free, individual, capable of independent
thought, I was just as guilty of unthinking automatism, with the
main difference between myself and Lucky being that the programming
I had bought into had tailfins and cruise control, instead of
point-and-click and multimedia capability.
In effect, although I considered myself some exemplary example
of the evolution of mankind (usually remembering to refer to
'humankind' to illustrate my UniSexual/NonRacist/Politically Correct rEvolutionAiryFairy development), I was actually a
fraud--not a TruthMonger, but a JokeMonger.
  While allowing myself the luxury of consternation over Lucky
Green being of a GenerationX which could not recognize the
prophetic warnings contained in 'The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre',
due to having been educated in an era where the 'BB/BB' tattoo
on a child's forehead, indicating that one was a BumBoy owned
by BigBrother (replacing childhood circumcision indicating that
a child was owned by the GodOfMoses), I nonetheless comforted
myself with the thought that *my* cowardly acceptance of 'the
way things are', illustrated by using my sense of ironic humor
to poke fun at things I knew to be insane, instead of taking
a firm, serious stand that ultimately results in crucifixion,
in Palestine, or to being barbequed, in Texas (see...there I go again), was somehow superior to the cowardice of Lucky's
generation, which gives Non-Sexual LipService to freedom,
privacy and anarchy, while preparing for an old-age where
they will undoubtedly justify their lack of total committment
to fighting the GreatEvil of their time by saying, "es, but
when the Computer was Fuhrer, the trains ran on time...until
the year 2000, of course."
I, like Lucky and the rest of the CypherPunks, told myself
that the problem was Dimitri, always trying to push Black
Unicorn's envelope, and not accepting my excuse that I wasn't really a cocksucker, but merely accepting of the fact that
BigBrother had a lot of mouths to feed...
[I know that I've rambled on too long to really hold the
 attention of a generation that traded in twenty-minute
 guitar solos for a Pentium processor, and really don't
 have time to wait for me to get to the point of what
 I am trying to say (despite their refusal to admit that
 the only reason they need a Pentium processor, in the
 first place, is to speed up the downloading of the ads
 on the Anti-SPAM Anarchist WebPage they are accessing,
 not to mention the mountains of excess commas contained
 in the 'True Story' manuscripts...).
 However, I need to run to the Liquor Store, giving the
 soft-drug old farts on the CPUNKS list a chance to "smoke
 'em if you got 'em," (<--correct punctuation, will wonders
 never cease?) and the young pissants on the CPUNX list a
 chance to throw on a New Crusty Nostrils CD, 'Ramblin',  featuring 'Green, Green', (<--incorrect punctuation)
 little realizing that the USENET post referring to the
 album as the product of a CypherPunks Action Project first
 appeared on April 1st, and that Lucky wasn't even born when
 it was recorded.

  No doubt there are a variety of self-impressed, elitist
CypherPunks who have grown used to my weird capitalization
of the word 'cypherpunks', as well as my excess use of
commas, and incorrect punctuation, having come to recognize that these things are part of my personal 'writing style'
(although few realize that, being too lazy to look up
proper spelling, and too ignorant to understand the reasons
behind 'correct' punctuation, I am merely cloaking my sloth
and stupidity under a croak of eccentric Oriental genius).
  However, there are undoubtedly a few egoistical self-proclaimed
geniuses on the CypherPunks Disturbed Male LISP who have noticed
the 'Dina' spelling of the last chapter title being out-of-sync
with the 'Diana' spelling of the current chapter title (see
above), and mentally ridiuculed me as really being the sorry
drunk I keep claiming to be, thinking that I am only dimly aware of the difference between my drunk&ignorant-but-honest
typos and literary mistakes, and the typos and mistakes which
I quickly recognize to have deep meaning, and are therefore
inviolate proofs of my true inner genius, in need of no
correction, even if I happen to spot the error.
  If you noticed the discrepancy mentioned above, and were
indeed mentally degrading my literary talent, while considering
yourself to be superior to me because of your ability to imitate a robotic computer spell-checking program, you would,
in this case, be quite correct in your assumption, since it
was really a meaninless mistake, but one I will not bother
to rectify, since I am currently both lazy and drunk.
  However, you smart-ass sons-of-bitches, it would be a serious
mistake to fail to realize that my failings in character in no
way negate my obvious intellectual superiority over all of the
pretentious fools who consider themselves part of an elite group of PseudoMathematicalGeniusAnarchists because of their
participation in Legendary LevelWithTheGround InterNet
Community MailingList Composed Of Subscribers Who Are Using
11% Of Their Potential BrainPower, and considering themselves
to be 'above' the other InterNet Elitists who are using only
the 'documented average' 10% of their potential brainpower,
and who, in turn, consider themselves to be superior to the AOL'ers who believe that their IQ is somehow related to the speed of their computer's processor (NOT!!!).
  The short and simple answer to the question, ""So what prompted you to start writing those missives to cypherpunks?"
is: "On a mailing list of elitist geniuses using only 11% of their potential brainpower, the person using 12% is King!"
  Thus I am able to toy with you silly fools, having little
fear of someone who uses 13% of their brainpower subscribing to the CypherPunks list, and putting me in my place, since a
person capable of using 13% of their brain would likely be
above joining the list in the first place...
Why I Send My Missives To The CypherPunks List    I truly recognize the past, current and future subscribers
to InterNet forums/experiences such as the CypherPunks to be
the only real hope for a world of VirtualReality to rise above
and go beyond the vicious MeatSpaceRealityCycles which are
evident throughout millennia of human history.
  Thus, I feel it incumbent upon myself, as your intellectual
superior, to impress upon you what an ignorant, silly asshole
I am...
  ou stupid fucks think I'm being silly, again, don't you?
I'm fucking serious!!!
  While I truly consider myself to be the current epitome of
human evolution to this point in time, I would, nonetheless,
upon being recognized for my great wisdom and genius and
declared King Of The World, issue a press statement advising
everyone to kill themselves, since a world under my control
would be a scary thing, indeed.
  As far as the world currently being under the control of
murderers and thieves who seem to have a lot of trouble
figuring out some of the more rudimentary things in life,
such as pulling up their fly upon entering the Offal Office,
I really prefer not to think about that, which I am sure
can be understood by voters in Boston, Chicago, ad infinitum,
who eventually figured out that the slogan, "Vote Early, Vote
Often" was not really a part of the original Constitution, as
their Ward Bosses had claimed.
The Original Peter Principle:
  Civilization and Human Behavior provide hard evidence that
Creatures From The Primordial Swamp who crawled out to become
Middle Managers in the Gene Pool did so about a billion years
ahead of schedule.
The Original Clinton Inaugural Address:
  "Most of my time, energy and money was spent on women, booze,
drugs and gambling--the rest I just wasted, eventually becoming Governor, and then President."
The Original Commandment:
  "Buy a fucking Clue!"
  I guess that what I am really trying to say is, "As insane
as it would be for you to vote for me as the new King Of The
World / Ruler Of All That Exists / New World Order Dictator,
etc., etc., it would be even more insane for you to *not*
vote for me if I was running against the people currently in
control of our governments and society.
Why I Send My Missives To The CypherPunks List   My only hope of being understood when I say, "I may be a
stupid fuck, but at least I'm not a stupid fuck." lies in
preaching to an audience that has the ability to understand
that ogi Berra's statement, "It's DejaVu all over again."
was nothing more nor less than A DirectMessageFromGod, designed to serve as the Cole's Notes To Universal Human
History From The Beginning Of Time, in a format that would
allow us to write it on a slip of paper we could tuck into
the elastic of our panties, in preparation for the FinalExam.
  True Initiates into the Mythical Circle of Eunuchs have long
understood that my obsession with peeking up women's skirts is
not the result of sexual depravity, but a highly spiritual
exercise in recognizing the difference between the masses of
Sheeple who truly benefit from the advice to wear clean
undergarments, in case they get hit by a bus, and those whose
unique, individual spark of life allows them to recognize that
they can step beyond society's strict moral programming by not
wearing any undergarments at all.
  Although I am currently up to my ass in drunken alligators,
I am still capable of remembering that my original objective
was to drain the Scotch...
And The Way This Relates To Craptographics Is:
  What is encryption, if not the epitome of the Anarchy Of  Meaning?    David Byrne, Largely Suited to serve as the Talking Head
who *could* be the originator of the Voice we hear, asking
us, "Psycho Killer, Qu'est Que C'est?", if we actually owned
a radio, understood that when Bob Dylan sang, "Johnny's in the basement, mixing up the medicine...", it was an oblique
reference to Owsley developing a chemical technique to thwart
the MindPolice by using LSD to encrypt one's thought processes.
  The Moody Blues, recognizing that the hippie movement arose
in response to Freedom and Privacy being threatened by a
GreyHound Restroom Public Key System that could be broken by
anyone with a dime, warned us that Timothy Leary, sick, depraved
pervert that he was, was 'outside, looking in', alerting us to
the fact that 'Free Shit' was nothing more than a corporate
advertising ploy by NewAge Gurus who wanted to save the cost
of a dime while buggering us, by telling us we may have won
'Free Film For Life.'
  Phil Zimmerman, Hero Of The TellGovernmentToSitOnItAndRotate
Revolution, provided us with the tools we needed to have a
genuinely Free Shit in Pretty Good Privacy, enabling us to lock the door while we crapped out our pearls of wisdom, while the anal-retentive government agents on the other side of the restroom-stall door dropped their dime, upon finding
out that the cost of peeking up the public's butt had risen
exhorbantly, due to those fucking California Hippie Trouble
Makers slipping 'acid' in their email.
  The point that I probably would have made much earlier in
this chapter, were it not for the fact that I am a drunken,
inconsiderate asshole who fails to realize that *some* people
have better things to do than to waste their time wondering
where the fuck I get all of these goddamn commas, is this:
  Anarchy is our only hope...
  Surely anyone who has been paying attention to life around
them could not have failed to realize that if society elects
some bum going through the dumpster, to look for lunch, to an
official government position that designates him to be the
person responsible for removing doggie-doo from the city
streets (no salary, but all you can eat...), he soon declares
that he needs more money and a larger staff to do his job
properly, funds research indicating that dog owners are a
threat to Family Values, Apple Pie and the American Flag,
presses for Law&Order legislation adding Thirty-Five Dog
ears to the sentence of any Monger or Mongrel who is found
guilty of 'squatting' in commission of a poop, and calls for
the censorship of 'The Doggie Of Anne Frank' because of
its graphic descriptions of FIDO crapping in a secret room in the attic, to avoid discovery by the DoggiePoop Gestapo.
  If you think I'm being a WiseGuy, then think again, because,
if memory serves me correctly, this was the lead headline of
News Of The Weird last week, even though the original source
for the article was on page 4,385 of the New ork Times.
The first act of organized religion was to fuck up the Lord's
Anarchy is our only hope...
The first act of organized government was to raise taxes so
that they could give themselves a pay raise.
Anarchy is our only hope...
  It is a knee-jerk reaction to bend over to pick up the soap
when somebody drops it, but it doesn't matter *who* fucks you,
it doesn't matter *how* they fuck you, *when* they fuck you,
or *why* they fuck you...the bottom line is this: If you remain
silent, ignoring the pain and indignity, listening to the still,
small voice of the Tao, you hear the Voice of Eternity echoing
from the birth of time to the death of the ten-thousand things,
whispering what was shouted by a great ogi, upon realizing that
the BigBang was actually a FistFucking KnuckleBall headed Hell
Bent For Leather (a California company) toward the Great Void
where the sun don't shine...you hear the Tao bend over and
whisper, "It's DejaVu, all over again."
Anarchy is our only hope...
Dr. Seuss Explains Sex To Children During His Prostrate Check:
  After God created Adam, he took a bone out of Adam's side
and created Eve. The first thing Adam did was give Eve another
bone-from behind, as he wanted it to be a surprise.
  If two people exist on the face of the planet, then, as surely
as night follows day, one of them is going to get fucked.
Anarchy is our only hope...
LIFE IN HELL Goes Country:
  If you can see two assholes on a horse, without lifting its
tail, then it is a good bet that they are voting to steal your
money and your freedom.
Anarchy is our only hope...
  We live in a world where, in a country in which starving
children are dying by the millions, the greatest threat to
those who manage to survive a FamineInTheMidstOfPlenty is
the ArmySurplusLandmine Company's 'Democracy' model, which
is guanteed to blow the limbs off of terrorists and freedom-
fighters, men, women and children, without discrimination as
to race, creed or color, although the guarantee clearly states
that it is not the responsibility of the manufacturer to see
that it serves the purpose for which it was originally intended, according the color-glossy brochures distributed by retired armed services officers now making the BigBucks as
DC corporate whores.
  "The Democracy Model Landmine"
  "Our most popular item, due to the billions of dollars in
   advertising given to its name through the use of taxpayer
   money being spent by unelected entities, both within and
   outside of government circles, was built and designed by
   highly qualified engineers and technicians to 'Save The
   Life Of A Single Child.'
  "As you can see from the pie-charts below, a computer
   simulation showed that a minimum distribution of a    hundred units per square mile is sufficient to save
   the life of a single child, providing that the child    is not so unfortunate as to accidentally step on a
   landmine."

that BATF agents were absent from the site at the time of the

of actors to impersonate members of an anarchistic, crypto-
privacy InterNet mailing list?
And who was the strange character from the Bay Area who
occassionally attended the meetings? She remembered seeing
him at Stanford during the visit of the SexCriminal and his
MainSqueeze to convince their daughter, Chelsea, that dating
a man who was stalking her father with a Stihl chainsaw could
have negative political reprecussions, and that she didn't need that fucking psycho's reassurances as to her sexuality,
since daddy also thought she had a great ass, and was not just
saying that because she was his daughter.

Anarchy is our only hope...
  Lone gunmen and unabombers are Dog's way of telling us,
as we stare at a meaningless election ballot, that we could
have had a V-8, pretending that we were drinking the blood
of a single innocent child we had slaughtered in an act of
random violence with an M-16, or in the bombing of TWA-800,
or any one of a variety of mind-numbing reminders that we,
as well as the cargo on our flight, are just numbers, that
can be erased with the stroke of a pen, or a flash of light

  Face it, the System isn't working...
  We need to Democratize murder, once again putting it in
the hands of the common people. People with wooden or stone
clubs; people with Saturday Night Specials; people with
knives in kitchen drawers, directly behind the freezer
door that their fat, lazy spouse is staring into, wondering
which gallon of ice-cream to eat first; people with access
to both the drug-cabinet and the maternity ward, who realize
that the solution to child-crime is stopping it at its very
  The process of natural selection, which decrees that only
the strong AND lucky survive, has been derailed by social
and government interference that leads to genocidal policies
which mark our fellow humans for deletion on the basis of
race, religious and/or ethnic background, political beliefs,
ownership of land which has oil or mineral reserves underneath it, use and development of strong crypto, ad infinitum...

  Once government got involved, the average Joe and Jane
couldn't hope to compete with the streamlined merger of
thousands of ignorant thugs into a single giant bully.
  It was a step backward for the JesusKillers, as well,
since they had a fighting chance against the more ignorant
members of the light-skinned races, who didn't realize
that it didn't really help for them to hide in dark alleys,
as well as members of the dark-skinned races who couldn't
resist smiling in the dark when a potential victim approached.
  Once ethnic discrimination was declared to be a function
of government, there was no need for Official Thieves Thugs
And Murderers to hide in dark alleys, since they could herd
their victims into railway cattle-cars by use of official
government brochures promoting Auschwitz as a Health Spa
with state of the art shower systems guaranteeing not only
hygenic cleansing, but also eugenic cleansing. Those who
enquired as to the meaning of 'eugenic cleansing' were
told that it would become clear upon their arrival...

  A passage in a work by one of the true literary genius'
of the InterNet (whose name I can't remember, but the work
was titled, "InfoWar") pointed out a period during which
violent crime was rapidly decreasing at the same time that
public perception of the rate of violent crime was reaching an all-time high.
  A parallel poll, commissioned by the People Against
Humanity division of the Synics Cociety, revealed that not
a single person taking part in the other poll believed
themself to be an ignorant, societally programmed moron,
incapable of anything beyond sucking up whatever slop

media troughs for consumption by those who believe that
the High Cost Of Rational Thought is an unbearable burden
that will leave them too poor to add the 24-Hour Drooling

  Anthropologists specializing in the rise of civilized
society have discovered that a solitary recluse living
alone in the wild, will, upon drooling and slobbering on
HimOrHerSelf, instinctively realize that, if they continue
to do so, then the chance of their ever developing the
ability to walk upright becomes radically diminished.
  At the same time, modern research indicates that if test
subjects from current society are exposed to pictures of
Michael Jordan drooling on his shoes, that manufacturers
can add a hundred dollars to the price of their sneakers
by adding artificial saliva-stains to them.
Anarchy is our only hope...
        WE ARE INTERRUPTING THIS PREVIOUSL SCHEDULED
        BROADCAST TO BEING OU AN IMPORTANT NEWS FLASH
        The Author, undoubtedly affected by solar flaring
        reflecting off of the early evening moon, suddenly
        realized why Leslie Stahl seemed so nervous during
        last night's '60 Minutes' piece on InterNet FUD,
        titled, 'The Rumor Mill.'
        It was not, as he originally suspected, Ms. Stahl
        psychically picking up on his efforts to peek up
        her skirt, and was, in fact, not the Scent of a         Woman, but the Scent of Fear...
        Fear that Jane and Joe Sheeple, empowered by InterNet
        Search Engines capable of catering to their true         desires, instead of attempting to mold their desires
        to fit the hidden agendas of Stahl's CBS controllers,
        might actually choose to access J. Orlin Grabbe's
        'World's 50 Greatest Conspiracies' website, and
        compare his 'information' with the 'information'
        provided by '60 Minutes'.
        Fear that a generation of people who had grown up
        believing Walter Cronkite when he ended his news
        casts with "That's the way it is...", would suddenly
        begin wondering why Wally never told them that Jack
        Kennedy, their beloved President, was screwing the
        living shit out of Marilyn Monroe, ending his news
        cast by making a circle with the forefinger and
        thumb of his left hand, poking his right index
        finger back and forth through the circle, and
        saying, "That's the way it is..."
        Fear that Marilyn Manson, whining on Public Radio
        about 'The Rumor Mill' on the InterNet spreading
        'lies' and 'disinformation' about HisOrHer tour,
        would be recognized by those paying attention as
        being strikingly similar to Ms. Stahl's whining
        on '60 Minutes' about the 'lies' and 'disinformation'
        being spread by people who had different beliefs
        about Reality and Truth than those that she held.
        Fear that vague hints about "Junk," "Regulation"
        and "Online Policemen" were not strong enough to
        truly get her point across, while indulging in
        violent screaming calling for hanging J. Orlin
        Grabbe by his hairy balls for disagreeing with
        her WorldView would only confirm viewer suspicions
        that she was in the same league, although on a
        different team, as Marilyn Manson, who believed
        that some kind of "censorship" was needed, to
        prevent the ChoirBoys at Ms. Stahl's church from
        spreading Christian Right lies about HisOrHer
        tour on the InterNet, while waiting their turn
        to insert their young, hard, throbbing cocks
        into a member of the congregation who was a
        regular correspondent on a major television news
        magazine show.
        Fear that the Author, currently working on the
        development of a forged Leslie Stahl's HomePage,
        had a 50-50 chance of correctly guessing whether
        or not she was wearing panties...
        WE NOW RETURN OU TO THE REGULARL SCHEDULED BROADCAST
                NO WE DONT...
  Someone drinking Dirty Mothers wrote the stuff above, last
night. Maybe it was me...maybe it wasn't...I woke up with a
  Regardless, reading today's posts to the CypherPunks list,
it soon became apparent that my clever ruse, pretending to
be intellectually superior to the other list members, worked!
  The real purpose of my egoistical diatribe was to ferret out
the list members not truly deserving of being on the same list
as the rest of us, who are using 11% of our potential brainpower.
  I knew that the Pretenders to our elitist level of being, being
insecure, insecure enough to avoid repeating repeating their
words, would accuse *me* of being insecure.
  Sure enough, the Pretender was exposed, and now we *all* know
that the Pretender on the list, whom we are all superior to,   Nobody!
  In retrospect, we were fools not to realize it long ago. All of the signs were there...
  The self-effaceing alias, 'Nobody'.    The inability to reflect a CypherPunks Consistent Net Persona.
  Always posting from different accounts: Juno, Replay,   HugeCajones, CypherPunks, Dev.Null...
  The propensity for taking wildly varying stances on the same
  issue.   Overcompensating for HisOrHer lack of self-worth by always
  demanding credit for HisOrHer posts, and never posting   Anonymously...
  I was surprised that the rest of the list members never figured it out.
  I guess I'm smarter than the rest of you...
        OK, *NOW* WE RETURN OU TO THE REGULARL SCHEDULED
        BROADCAST--*REALL*-I *MEAN* IT THIS TIME!!!
        ACTUALL, I FORGOT WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT, SO
        I THINK I'LL JUST TR TO EXPLAIN A CONCEPT I WAS
        THINKING ABOUT ESTERDA, BUT NEGLECTED TO ADDRESS:
                ANARCH IS OUR ONL HOPE...
  Uhhh...
  I hate to appear to be a fucking idiot, incapable of
sustaining a logical train of thought, but I just reached
the PointOfEnlightenment that comes around 4 a.m., when
one is out of beer and beginning to sober up, and looks
at the orange sitting on their desk and sees...an orange!
  Not the cosmically meaningful macrocosm/microcosm orange
that seems to hold the key to the secrets of the universe
when one is high on acid. Not the orange with a bit of
green-stuff starting to show on its surface when you look
at it at the end of another long, hard day at the Salt
Mine, whereupon you chastise yourself for letting it go
bad before eating it, because your tired, acheing bones
remind you that you are living in a cold, hard world.
  No, it is the orange that both the pragmatist and the
mystic see at 4 a.m., about an hour after the last beer
is gone, and the liquor store doesn't open for another
few hours. The *real* orange...
  Anyway, 'Anarchy Is Our Only Hope...' is one of those
Deep Truths (TM) that are important to attempt to explain
to the unenlightened, who quit doing acid in '72, and now
have regular jobs.
  But, Fuck It (TM)!
  SPACE ALIENS HIDE M DRUGS!!! was always intended to be
my autobiography, but somebody else started it (although
I'm not complaining, because the FUD generated helped to
cover my ass on the original TruthMonger SoftTarget Tour)
and I think I have the right to be a little self-indulgent
(like it's the first time...right!) and put off finishing
the Bienfait Nutly News "ANARCH IS OUR ONL HOPE!" Chrismas Special for a day or so.
  So I think I'll sink into one of my undermedicated, ill-
advised rants about my personal issues, history and problems
which only remotely relate to the goals and purposes behind
the creation of the CypherPunks list.
  Unless you have a lot of idle time on your hands, you might
just want to go ahead and delete the next chapter of SAHMD,
since it will undoubtedly be a semi-coherent, rambling diatribe
with little relevance to your life and/or your interests.
  On the other hand, given my present state of mind, and the
fact that I just found a warm beer in the back of my truck,
the next chapter may well turn out to be one of those classic
works of literature that can only be produced by someone who
finds themself in the Desolate Place, an hour after they have
finished the LastBeerInTheWholeWorld (like Job), and then
is reborn, resurrected, refurbished by the discovery that,
not only is there a God AND a Dog, but there is also another
  Smoke 'em if you got 'em...

  Delbert McClinton, a paid media informant for a shell of the former Time Bandits, the Nutly Noose, sent me a private
email, the contents of which which ethics and propriety forbid me to disclose, although it can be PartyPhrased as,
"So why the fuck do you keep sending your goddamn SPAM to
 the CypherPunks list, you illiterate, drunken asshole?!?!?"
The Real (TM) Answer   "Because I'm a CypherPunk, ShitForBrains!!!...!!!"
 "I don't care what they say about me, as long as they spell
 my name wrong."
~  Declan McCaulkin
   Former OldSpiceBoy who recently cut a solo album, "ArmGlue"
  Declan McCullagh (ever notice that I only get his name right
when I'm insulting him?), who used to be an unread, but lightly
respected journalist for the Netly News (it is better to remain
unread and thought a Tool, than to get a byline and remove all
doubt) sold the soles of his shoes to pay the piper, only to
discover that his Controllers at Time Magazine, a subsiduary
of a fidicuary corporation, Slime, Inc., wholly owned by the
MainStream Enquirer (Gyrating Minds Want To Be Snowed) had
already paid the 'fiddler', and thus got to NameThatTune, since
they were astute enough to realize that the 'original' quote
was, "Those who learn from the mistakes of the past, can
profitably repeat them."
  So now Declan, currently only a part-time employee of the
CIA/FBI/DEA/NSA (and ASecretThreeLetterOrganizationWhich-
SecretlyControlsTheWholeWorldToBeNamedLater) as a result of
being fired as a Cuspected CypherPunks Cpy, but rehired on
a consultancy basis to be a Shadow of his former self...
  Damn...lost my train of thought, again. I guess that's why
they don't pay me the BigBucks...
  Anyway, if Declan had been one of the original coconspirators
(sometimes spelled with a hyphen) in the Secret Plot Against
The CypherPunks List, instead of a JohnnyComeLately trying to
jump on the bandwagon, after believing Jim Bell when he told
Declan how great prison food is, he would be aware that a
chapter of a previous 'True Story Of The InterNet' manuscript
pointed out that a member of an elite group of dribblers
who wore green bibs with numbers on them, the CelticPunks,
Kevin McHale (if that is his *real* name...), said of a
fellow CelticPunks member, Danny Angst, "Sure, he's actually a slobberer, but he's *our* slobberer!"
  This quote was used to illustrate my point that the late
Dr. Dimitri Vulis, KOTM, an IgnorantInsaneInconsiderateIgnoble
Asshole, was a 'CypherPunks' IgnorantInsaneInconsiderateIgnoble
Asshole (TM). PissAnt Dale Thorn was a 'CypherPunks' PissAnt.
Cocksucker John Gilmore was a 'CypherPunks Cock Cucker' (not
to be confused with the Criminal Cocksucker of Canada). Statist
GuberMint Chill, Kent Crispin, was a 'CypherSpooks' Statist
DoubleMint Chill, and a secret member of the Circle of Eunuchs.
  The veteran elitists on the list accused me of being a
elitist neophyte who was bitter over not having received a
CecretSypherPunksDecoderRing (TM), but none of this really
has anything to do with the point I am trying to make...

Why I Am Spamming The CypherPunks List   I am the TruthMonger.
  The dedication of my life to becoming one with the MadDog-
InPossessionOfTheLastFalseSmile resulted in my being forcefully
unbriscrived from the Jack Nicholson Fan Club Mailing List,
because "THE CAN'T *HANDLE* THE TRUTH!"
  In loneliness and depravation, I decided to sribvive to the
Suicide Mailing List, but it turned out to be just a corporate-
sponsored pimple on the butt of the InterNet, created as a means
to feature the Nike 'Just Do It' logo. (Besides, there was only
one other member on Suicide Mailing List, and she only sent a
single post, a suicide note, helping me to realize that she had
really belonged on the list, while I was just a rubbernecker.
  I then subscribed to the AIDS Support List, but was kicked off
when they discovered that I didn't have AIDS, and was just there
to try and meet women.
  On advice of legal counsel, and Jerry Falwell, I will refrain from describing my experiences on the Christian Pre-Teen Mailing
List, since charges are still pending.
  Why did I subscribe to the CypherPunks Mailing List? It was    the last one...I had been kicked off of all the others.
  I thought that this time, I might be accepted for who I
really pretend to be, since I believed that the other list
members would be delighted to know that I had 'broken PGP,'
although I couldn't provide any proof of it, at the time.
Also, I had just completed work on a totally unbreakable
encryption system, although I was hesitant to share details
with others, in fear that someone might figure out how it
worked, thus compromising the total security it provided.
  When the rest of the list suckbikers attacked me in fits of
RayCharlesRage, I realized that they, like myself, suffered
from Tourette Syndrome, and were not just pretending to,
like Andrew Dice Clay. I suddenly realized that encryption
was a science that had come about as a result of hundreds of
years of misdiagnosis of Dyslexia and Attention Deficit
Disorder (not to be confused with Federal Deficit Disorder,
which causes politicians peering into taxpayer pockets to
see a Bottomless Pit).
  I realized that these people were sick motherfuckers...
  I was home...
If ou Can't Kill The List ou Love, Kill The One ou're On:
  I have never been fond of the CypherPunks Mailing List, or
its subscribers. The list and list members are a constant
reminder that I am a mental misfit and a social outcast,
chased by the torch-bearing angry mob of decent, law-abiding
NetiZensComeLately back to the CypherPunks Cecret Castle,
cleverly disguised as a Mailing List.
  It is indeed a great irony that I, a pretentious interloper
on the list, was ultimately responsible for single-handedly
rescuing the CypherPunks list from death and oblivion.
  I know what you're thinking: "Drop the crack pipe, and slowly
back away from the keyboard..."
  But it's True (TM), I swear to Dog.
  I'm not claiming to be some kind of Hero, or to be Dustin
Hoffman, or anything, since it came about quite by accident.
  At the time of the Legendary CypherPunks Censorship Crisis
(not to be confused with the CypherPunks Moderation Experiment),
I did everything I could to forment dissent, cause fractious
fractal fractures between the list members, shooting and pissing
at everyone and everything in sight, even myself, suffering
several serious foot-wounds in the process.
  It was only later, when it became obvious that the CypherPunks
list was going to survive, and prosper, and that, in fact, a
beautiful Toad had been transformed, by the KissOfDeath, into
a plethora of ugly PrincesAndPrincesses, that I realized that
the CypherPunks Censorship Crisis had been an attempt to destroy
the list, by making it just another bland, everyday imitation
of PoliticallyCorrectMasturbation that would make our mothers
proud of us, as long as we didn't stain the sheets too badly.
  In retrospect I realized that I had inadvertently saved the
list from a Zombie-like future as just another sidestreet on
the Information Highway by using my posts to promote and
glorify violent anarchy against reason, common sense, and
everything that my mother and father taught me in the hope
of saving me from being a bad influence on myself, little
realizing that I was actually epitomizing what the CypherPunks
Disturbed Male LISP was really about.
  I realize that I am enclosing myself in an aura of grandoise
self-importance once again, since most of the list subscribers
fell into the same knee-jerk reactions as I did, even the ones
who were calling the loudest for censorship, but doing so by
shitting and pissing on the OfficiallyPerceivedTroubleMakers
on the list, so, in actual fact, one might surmise that the
CypherPunks Mailing List was not so much 'saved' by anyone,
as merely confirming itself to be an IndestructibleEntity that
would survive as long as their was a single individual on the
face of the earth who continued to respond to a perfectly
reasonable and valid statement with, "Oh yeah? Sez who?", or
a pair of bickering children screaming, "Did so!/Did not!/Did
so!/Did not!"
  Still, I think I deserve a CypherPunksSecretDecoderRing...

Questionable Quotes "If the Army of God can kill so many people from the
 Missionary Position, where the risk of transmitting
 AIDS is comparitively low, then the Army of Dog
 should be that much more effective, working Doggie
 Style..."
~The Unknown CypherPunk (aka TCM)
 CypherPunks Cult of One
 Bay Area Addition
  The recent phenomena of the Army of Dog, which has had a
long history of never before existing, is rumored by many
to be a splinter group of the Circle Of Eunuchs, which had
come into existence as a result of an announcement on December 7, 1989, by Bubba Rom Dos, that the existence such
a group would be extremely dangerous to those involved, and
that everyone assembled should immediately disband and have
no further contact with one another.
  The Circle of Eunuchs, a wholly owned subsiduary of the
Magic Circle, headquartered nowhere, has managed to keep  their heads, as well as avoid being drawn and quartered, by never really existing. Although consisting of 3-member
Gorilla Cells whose manner and method of their use of bananas is totally up to the individuals involved, based
on their personal ethics and morals, none of the members
can ever really be certain that the CoE actually exists,
although it is pretty hard to deny the existence of the
bananas, if you have made the mistake of choosing your
fellow CoE Gorilla Cell members randomly from ads in
the free magazines widely available in San Franciso.
  The Army of Dog operates much along the same lines, with  the major difference being that more of the members choose  to act alone, in solitary Cult of One units, with the more
moderate members generally requiring reading glasses, while
the more radical members eventually go blind.
  Seasoned warriors, they refuse to ask for pity or sympathy,
having only themselves to blame, 'cause momma tried...  Questionable Quotes "ou don't have to have a bottle of Mercetan to know
 which way Janet Reno is blowing."
 BellWeatherMen Cult of One
 Seattle AboveGround Cell
  Army of Dog recruits, going one step further than the
Army of God members who have so successfully avoided being
hunted down like dogs by LEA's around the country, perform
many of their nefarious activities on behalf of causes that
they have little or no connection to, little or no interest
in, and do not necessarily believe in.
  For example, an Army of Dog Virtual Warrior who is very
passionate in their feeling regarding the demonization and  persecution of Kevin MitNikita, but who thinks that Jerome
Dalton Bell is an asshole who got what he had coming to him,
would naturally gravitate toward performing subversive
actions which violated the conditions of Bell's parole.
(If that AoD Warrior was a minor, they might even be bold
 enough to join with other minors in small Saskatchewan
 towns, acting in concert with NineInchNails, knowing they
 would not have to worry about being tried as an adult,
 since they could prove that their uncle, the Author, was
 not even an adult.)
  On the other hand, a CypherPunks Army of Dog Virtual
Warrior, who feels indebted to Jim Bell for the blow jobs
while awaiting trial (even though he *did* have to hold
a knife to Jim's throat, since Jim was playing 'hard to
get'), would perform their subversive activities on behalf of the UnaBomber, who they thought was a fucking
lunatic who was better off locked up.
(For instance, they might perform a variety of low-key
 meatspace crimes, such as setting the Dumbarton bridge
 on fire, just before the UnaBomber's trial, and then
 notify the President by email that they were ready to
 step in and take the UnaBomber's place if he was
 executed. Natually, they would do this from a hacked
 account...)
Questionable Quotes "Give them Flack, John."
 Church of the SubGenius Cult of One
 Davis-Monathan Division
  Many Army of Dog recruits are LEA's and paid government
informants who tried to infiltrate the AoD, but who got
a little carried away and eventually ended up performing
some act of meatspace violence so atrocious that they had
to quickly find a scapegoat such as Timoth McVeigh, to
take the fall.
(Although the agent code-named Defcon McCullagh Chainsaw
 claims he was just there to cover the bombing, in a
 free-lance assignment for the Oklahoma Nutly News, he
 has thus far failed to adequately explain submitting  a receipt for breakfast with the BATF shortly before
 the explosion, or why the BATF would be having champagne
 and caviar for breakfast, saying only, "Eggs is eggs...")
Questionable Quotes "I never minded about the little things."
~Bridget Fonda
 The Author's Secret Lover Cult of One
  Although both Army of Dog Virtual Warriors and MeatSpace
Warriors are quick to point out that sex after plugging a
strangers parking meter, or setting off the fire alarm at the local school via modem, is phenomenal, they also point out that it doesn't hurt to have a co-conspirator (sometimes spelled without the hyphen).
  One Army of Bitch WarriorGoddess, speaking about her long-time relationship with an AoD programmer, said, "Although he starts with a relatively small value of 'c', he always increments it, and sometimes puts it through what seems to be an endless loop."
(For the non-computer oriented, that loosely translates
 as, "He may not touch bottom, but he sure raises hell
 with the sides.")

     * Sender: owner-cypherpunks
I was asked to forward this message to the Cypherpunks list by Linda
Reed...Who sent it to me as a responce to one of my e-mails...I know that
by doing so, I risk being kicked, stomped, beated siverly amongst the
neck and shoulders, and even flamed...But I think so many of us are not
looking at the true messages involved in these 'spams'.  Reed is makeing
several REALL good points...Given, Reed does rant a bit...And some of
what is writen is just so much bullshit...But all of it, taken in
context, is Truth (TM)...
Let me make a suggestion to Reed and all others involved...There is a
time and place for everything...The time for rEvolution, as Reed puts it,
is _NOW!_ However, Cypherpunks is not the place...So does anyone know of
any good e-lists that would love to get the ALIANS posts?  Maybe your
five minute's of thought on a way to help Reed will make everyone happy,
Vs the hours some of us are spending complaining about the damn thing.
[Gnat From The Author:
 As the Author, We personally believe that  should forcefully unsubscibe itself from the CypherPunks  Distributed Node Mailing Lists, since it is the website
 which the Author is currently using to read the list posts.
 As well, We feel that Linda Reed  should take steps to block her email account from being sent
 to any site on the InterNet, as it is being used, with or
 without her consent, to generate UCE/SPAM.
 In addition, We feel that all CypherPunks Distributed Node
 Mailing List members should forcefully unsubscribe themselves
 from the lists, as spammers, since it is enevitable that there
 is someone on the list who considers their posts irrelevant,
 off-topic, or SPAM, at one point or another.
 In the future, the Author would be happy to provide a filtered
 version of the CypherPunks Distributed Node Mailing List which
 would be distributed freely to all CypherPunks whose non-union
 dues are currently paid up to date.
 The filtered version would contain complete copies of all posts
 routed through the current CypherPunks Distributed Mailing List
 Nodes, without any deletions or censorship, in accordance with
 CypherPunks Goals and Traditions.
 For a slight extra fee, the Authors would also be happy to  provide special, Enhanced Editions of the CypherPunks Filtered
 Mailing List:
 1. ASCII Art Edition: Containing classic reprints of Timmy    C. Mayonnaise ASCII-Art SPAMS, complete with Forged Digital
   Signatures of Dr. Dimitri Vulis, KOTM, along with a Certificate
   of Genuine Authenticity Digitally Signed with the Electronic
   Forgery Foundation's Pretty Lousy Privacy Key.
 2. Censorship Crisis II Edition: Offers the convenience of
   recreating the original posts for and against censorship
   of the CypherPunks list, substiuting the names, email
   addresses and digital signatures of current list members,
   saving list members hours of rehashing old issues, while
   maintaining the emotionally volatile atmosphere regarding
   an argument that is logically ridiculous to argue about
   in the first place, given the nature of the CypherPunks    list.
    !!!PLUS!!! As An Added Bonus: (At No Extra Charge!)
   * A complete pro-censorship and anti-censorship thread
    dealing specifically with the SPAMing of SAHMD chapters
    to the CypherPunks list, with each post written and
    autographed the the Author HimOrHerSelf!
   * A Classic Collection of past posts by both legendary
    and long-forgotten CypherPunks, quoting and misquoting
    the "Doomed to Learn From the Mistakes of the Past"     (or whatever) quote.(A 5MB package, by itself, alone!)
   * A Superb Collection of Lame-AND/OR-Offensive Posts
    categorized under such headings as UNSCRIBIBVE, LAME,
    RACIST, CHILDISH, 'I BROKE PGP!', 'NEW UNBREAKABLE
    ENCRPTION ALGORERHTHM',          , RE:          ,
    STUPID, AOL, 'I THINK WE SHOULD ALL SEND TEN COPIES
    OF THIS POST BACK TO DIMITRI', and one of the all-time
    favorites of many Veteran Elitist CypherPunks List
    Members, 'TEST'.
 3. Pre-Checked Archive Edition: Each post is marked with
   a special flag to indicate whether or not the post is
   duplicative of a subject discussed, or a point made by,
   Tim C. May at some time in the history of the CypherPunks
   list, as well as a flag indicating whether or not the
   post agrees with Mr. May's past theories and views, so
   that they can be efficiently deleted in order not to
   waste the reader's time with BadInformation, one way
   or the other.
  Those pre-dating their orders for an Enhanced Edition
  of the Author's Filtered CypherPunks Mailing List to
  December 7, 1989, or forging Tim C. May's digital
  signature to their order, will receive copies of
  Nalus Optic's coming post to list, whining about how
  HisOrHer original post *NEVER* called for censorship,
  Tim C. May's future reply that this is obviously the
  work of that asshole, Toto, again, Robert Hettinga's
  future post that he *loves* this list, another post
  from Tim C. May, obviously forged by Toto, saying that
  he can't find his shoes *or* his goddamn dentures, and
  a variety of future posts from various list members   stating:
  "Just ignore him."
  "Don't you people have delete keys?"
  "Happy Fourth of July!"
  "I'm putting Toto back in my KillFile!"
  "I never took him out of mine, I just read his posts
   by accident when I read all of the posts in my KillFile,
   to make sure I'm not deleting anything important."
  ""
  "Have a good Labor Day!"
  "Unscrrvive"
  "Unrivcribe cypherpunks "
  "Unsvribe  cypherpunks"
  "Uncribive cypherpunks"
  "Unsrivribe "
  "Merry Chrismas Everybody!"
  "Take me off this goddamn list!"
  "TAKE ME OFF THIS LIST! I MEAN IT!!!"
  "Happpy Holidays and a Happy New ear"
  "Please take me off this list, ok? Please, somebody?"
  "OK OU ASHOLES! IM GOING TO KEEP THIS UP UNTIL OU..."
 DISCLAIMER: The Author is in no way implying that those
 who do not wish to take advantage of this tremendous
 offer are not free to just contine their involvement in
 the Cypherpunks list and use methods of subscribing and  posting pretty much the same as they did before deleting  this offer without reading it.
 However, HeOrShe reserves the right to bill all who
 receive this offer the full amount of the CypherPunks
 current non-union dues, if this offer is not returned
 to the CypherPunks mailing list they received it from,
 in it's original condition, with full message headers,
 within thirty minutes or less of its original posting.]

TERMINATING RESISTOR 3
TR3 completes the Magic Circle of Eunuchs with a bizzare, if
somewhat predictable twist, as ACyborgToBeNamedLater begins
to materialize on the SilverSceenOfVirtualReality in the form
of TheRealGuy...naked, as usual.
It turns out that the Author, sent back in VirtualRealityTime
by John Parker, in order to ensure the safety of Captain John
Parker, thus preserving the course of history taken by the
American Revolution, got drunker than a skunk on cheap Scotch,
and ended up embroiled in the Legendary CypherPunks Moderation Revolution/Anti-Censorship CounterRevolution of 1997, instead.
The Author, again predictably, spills Scotch on his Digital
Implant during his journey through time, frying the Radio
Shack circuitry that resulted in HimOrHer being dubbed, "The
Six Million Peso ManOrWoman ($42.00/U.S.)" and becomes a
Taoist AuthorBot working for both the Farces of Light and
the Farces of Darkness, thus saving the movie producers the
expense of paying an extra actor in this low-budget, B-grade
Film BlancNoire.
The movie quickly degenerates into a pornographic monstrosity,
with Sarah Parker, unsure as to who the father of John Parker
actually is, since the little glue-sniffing prick was conceived
during an alcoholic binge, fucks everyone in sight, to make sure the little bastard gets conceived. The Author, obsessive-
compulsive tit-man that he is, invariably throws his hands over
her boobs at the slightest sign of danger, claiming, "John's a
growing boy...he needs his milk."
Investigating the Church of the SubGenius, the AuthorBot soon
discovers that the movie is being produced by a group of non-
union UnderGroundReptilianNazis, as a result of overhearing
several of the producer's phone conversations, which they
always end by saying, "Let's do Earth."
The AuthorBot develops an obsession with Little Timmy Mayonnaise
after becoming sexually excited by the Evil Dr. Vulis's ASCII
Art Spams, begins wearing a CoonSkin hat made from the hide of
Medgar Evans and drunkenly mumbling, "Remember Los Alamos...
Chop, Chop!" at every opportunity.
The saving grace of the movie is the soundtrack, courtesy of
Al Fowl And The Snakes, a Tucson ReptilianChickenBot Band
of ill-repute, featuring their Number 1 With a HollowPoint-
TeflonTipped-CopKillerBullet song, "If ou Can't Kill The

BumGirl Interview: T.C. BUTTSLAM
  A LindaLoveLaceInDepthInterview with one of the original
  Flounders ("I may smell like fish, but don't call me   chicken.") of the CypherPunks Disturbed Male LISP, Timothy   C. "No! It doesn't stand for 'cocksucker'!" May.
  After checking the Andy WhoreHole Mailing List archives,   and finding that it was  who originally   posted the concept that, in the future, every CypherPunk   would have 15" of fame, BumGirl EditWhores decided to change
  the cover of the July, 1998, edition to feature a picture
  of a variety of current CypherPunks wearing only athletic-
  support cups with long, long, long bar-codes on them.   {ANastyBumGirlToBeReamedLater, caught in a cross-fire on
  Mayonnaise Mountain between Timothy C. May, the Philosopher
  Marksman of the CypherPunks Disturbed Male LISP, and LEA's
  who were badly outmanned and outgunned by the Cult Of One
  CypherPunk who owns a variety of weaponry registered in
  the names of a plethora of CypherPunks Consistent Net
  Personas, bent over and stuck her head in the sand, hoping
  that if she took one in the butt, it would be a long, hard
  one, Teflon-tipped, in order to penetrate her new Kevlar
  panties.
  The BumGirl interview took place during lulls in the action,
  when LEA agents carried off their dead and wounded, while
  LittleBigTimmy and Dust'em Hoffman argued over their Pretty
  Lousy Privacy CryptoPhones as to how many dead IRS agents
  it takes to spell, "I *told* you Jim Bell is a CypherPunk!"}
BumGirl: our Tim C. May CypherPunks Consistent Net Persona
has such long and well-documented history of raising hell with
the sides of the Bleeding Edge of InterNet Freedom and Privacy
Technology (TCM) that it is hard to know where to begin.
TCM: Let's talk about the Author, instead.
BumGirl: Shit! Is this interview just another piece of mindless
trash from the Electronic Forgery Foundation?
TCM: ou don't understand...*I* am the Author!
BumGirl: Well, bend me over and pretend we're married! Are you serious?
TCM: Nuke DC!
But seriously...Nuke DC!
BumGirl: If you are really the Author, as you claim, then why
aren't you trying to peek up my skirt, to see if I am wearing
TCM: That's Toto's schtick...pardon the pun...uuhhh...if it
*was* one...
Where was I? Hey! There's my shoes...
That's how the reader can tell which chapters of 'The True
Story of the InterNet' manuscripts are authentic, and which
ones are forgeries...by the perverted diatribes about peeking
up women's skirts that form an integral part of the forgeries
of that fucking asshole interloper on my...I mean...'the'...
CypherPunks list.
Besides, I read the above intro to this BumGirl interview, so
I know you're wearing Kevlar panties. That makes me *hot*...
BumGirl: Don't! Stop! Just because I have my head in the sand,
like your typical AOL'er, doesn't mean I can't tell what you're
trying to do back there...
Why did you stop? I'm Catholic, so I *have* to tell you to stop.
Don't! Stop! Don't stop! Don't stop!
TCM: Hey! That's not a diaphragm...that's a *badge*
Jesus H. 'Fucking' Christ! ou're Janet ReamHole...
No wonder you've got your head in the sand...
  [There was a loud popping sound on the audio tape that    the BumGirl EditWhores received from some anonymous
   coward, via snailmail with no return address on the
   envelope.
   The freelance BumGirl ReportWhore sent to do the
   interview mysteriously failed to return, causing us
   to wonder if we'd been duped, when the head of the
   DOBJ suddenly became 'unavailable for comment' at    the same time our ReportWhore disappeared. A few days
   later, however, the head of the DOBJ was spotted by
   the MainDream press as she exited a secret underground
   lavoratory suspected to be involved in cloning-related
   technology.
   Once an anonymous email arrived from Mark Hedges, who    really should learn to use learn remailers properly if    he's going to claim to be a CypherPunk (hint: delete    your digital signature before sending the fucking thing,
   dude...), BumGirl EditWhores couldn't help but notice    that, when she removed her glasses, she *did* look a lot    like Buddy...]
BUMGIRL DISCLAIMER:
There is absolutely no truth to the slanderous rumors being
spread by the Church of SubScientology (an affiliate of the
Norman Church--more commonly referred to as 'The Church of Jesus H. 'Fucking' Christ of Labor Day Chincs'--headquartered
in SaltLick City, China, and long rumored to be the secret lair of the Cult of One Dead Cow, Army of DogEaters Division),
turned over the violently abused and sexually violated carcass
of our missing BumGirl ReportWhore (dropped off at our offices by a barefoot, toothless old fart wearing a T-shirt with three lines of Perl code on the front) to local Ferral Bureau42 of Instigation foreskinsic axespurts.
The truth is, after our own exspurts performed DNA/RSA tests
on the body, to determine the exact nature of the bizarre
acts of cryptophilia performed upon her after her death, we
simply dumped her body next to several others down an old
mining shaft at a popular shooting range outside of Tucson,
where, unbeknownst to BumGirl, FBI agents were busy going
through the pockets of a witness to the Vincent Price/Phiszt
Foster parking-lot-car-drowning, having inadvertantly disposed
of the body without removing identifying signs such as large
diamond rings, expensive watches, folding money and loose As the two MotorCycleMommaDykesOnSpikes, hired by BumGirl to
dispose of the body, fled the scene, they overheard one of
the FBI agents, who had been trained by Lieutenant Calley not to waste perfectly good pussy, exclaim, upon lifting our dead
ReportWhore's skirt, "Jesus H. 'Fucking' Christ, it's Jimmy FuckingGodamnn Hoffa!" Apparently, another FBI agent, after
performing a street-sniff test on our dead ReportWhore's dick, contended that it was not Hoffa, but J. Edgar Hoover,
with another agent confirming his suspicions by giving the
dick a long, involved taste-test to preclude any possibility
of the dick being a Cirle Of Eunuchs transplant meant to
disguise the body as that of the recently missing caterer
to the Bay Area CypherPunks physical meetings.
The MotorCycleMommaDykesOnSpikes told BumGirl EditWhores,
as we paid them the agreed-upon fee of 'as many rolls of
quarters as you can carry without using your hands', "We
couldn't pass up the opportunity to commit oral sodomy on
your dead ReportWhore before dumping HimOrHer down the
mind shaft, and, well...she tasted a lot like Buddy..."
Although it *is* true that BumGirl hired the current head
of the DOBJ to finish the BumGirl interview with TCM, (not
to be confused with Turner Classic Movies), we told HimOrHer
that the best approach would be to show up unannounced on
Mayonnaise Mountain, flash HisOrHer badge, and announce that she was just taking him downtown, 'to answer a few BumGirl EditWhores do not expect the T.C. BUTTSLAM interview
to be completed, but we are making plans to include a photo-
special in our next edition, titled, "Beware the Ides of May"
complete with never-before-seen scenes of oft-rumored but
never confirmed Secret CypherPunks Social Activities known

in time to throw the Author into a hysterical state of Termial
Paranoia, was called, "They Live, and still is. (called that,
I mean). [EditWhore's Node: The reason the Author never bothers to

 be gaining on you."]
It was a dark and normal night...
Until the Author booted up SCO Xenix at 4 a.m. in a sleazy
little motel room in ButtFuck, North Dakota. Then, as the
Daemons, Zombies, Orphan Zombies and the dreaded Cron were
released to wreak their havoc in ToshibaWorld, in the heart
of the Author's 5200C portable computer, LadyLuck, not having
a date for the evening, intervened to provide mitigating
circumstances which would eventually become evidence in the
Court Of Public Opinion as to the mitigating circumstances
which needed to be considered before sentencing the Author
to a lifetime of Hard Labor, trying to give birth to a new
perceptive world-view paridigm in which WeTheSheeple felt
perfectly comfortable returning a judgement of, "Guilty,
by reason of insanity." (As well as a guilty verdict on the

warn others about the frightening dangers to be found
lurking within the heart of the Unix Operating System,
was to use the Medium to proclaim the Message (even though,
according to Marshal McClueHandLuke, they are identical
twins, although in a microcosm-macrocosm sort of way,
like Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwartzenager).
Thus was born, "The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre - The True Story Of The InterNet - Part I."
The rest is history...

writing some of it, now...which you are reading...now.

 asshole who could never keep track of the point he

Wait here, I'll be back...
"Fuck! Godamnn it!"
'o'  OK, like I was saying...
The Author, in 1989, had discovered and explored the first, true VirtualRealityMultiMediaExperience, in
which HeOrShe could no longer distinguish between the
Medium, the Message, the Meaning, the MeanderingMind,
or the voices inside her head which told her that
the Messages From Mars coming through the fillings
in her teeth were FUD, disseminated by an insurance
sales activist with a hidden agenda.
Worried about the fact that some egoistical, elitist
fuckwad might, at some point in the future, try to
claim credit for the Author's discovery of MultiMedia,
HeOrShe set Stanley's WayBack Machine to a point which
corresponded to the exact Time-Space-Mind equivalent
of the Nadir Point between alpha and omega, and could
distinctly hear Tim C. May  hollering,
"I'm going to write about MultiMedia in the CypherPunks
archives on the first day the list exists, and you will
*never* get credit for the concept."
  The Author, realizing that the preceeding makes little
sense, suddenly realized that all HeOrShe really wanted
to point out in this chapter is that, despite the fact
that it is a B-grade movie in which Meg Foster never
shows her tits, the movie 'They Live' speaks a Truth
which needs to be understood by any individual who professes an interest in journeying beyond an imaginary
world-view in which he believes that buying the Jeep
seen sitting on top of the mountain peak will really
result in him getting to fuck the living shit out of
the large-breasted blonde bombshell lying across the
hood of the vehicle. (Or, alternatively, her thinking
that purchasing New Lemon Joy Dish Detergent will
really lead to her lifemate doing his share of the
dishes, and becoming more romantic, instead of just
humping her and then rolling over and going to sleep.)

  The second half of the second problem is that, not only are
the RCMP in mortal danger of believing their own press, but they
also face the even more mortal danger (A coward dies a thousand
deaths--but more on *that* later...) of the reverse parallax
corollary of their ArchieEnemy, the Bienfait Nutly Noose, being
found believable, despite the OneManFullCourtPress's constant
claims of conniving, conspiratorial lunacy fed by a wide variety
of widely recognized atmospheric brainwave disturbances which
are caused by such things as solar flare-ups, moon phases, and

or how many guns they acquire (while hiding the citizen's guns
under a Rock), being trained to obey, instead of think, may
prove to be their ultimate undoing.
  What I am getting at, here, is that there is undoubtedly not
a single member of the RoyalHorseHumpers who has crossed my
path in the last half-decade who has not taken one look at
me and instinctively realized that I needed to be put down
like a filthy dog, despite the admonishons of their superiors
that the all-important Image (TM) must be maintained, for
appearances sake.
  Now...it is too late.
  A member of a Canadian mainstream community cult known as
the Estevanites, Brad Parker (no relation to himself), once
replied, upon being asked his name by a member the Royal
HorseHumpers, "Fuck ou! My name is Fuck ou!"
  Being, at the time, your AverageCanadianWhiteBoyPussy, it took me years to realize that, far from being a beligerant,
ignorant fool, too stupid to forsee the consequences of his
actions, Brad had astutely assessed the situation which he
found himself in, and realized that being taken to jail,
instead of being severly beaten and left lying in a back
alley, was the superior option only when one did not have
a friend who had promised to meet him at home with a case
of beer after the bars closed.
  He made the right choice...
{Let's have a big, big round of applause for broken, bleeding

I've Got BackDoors Coming Out My AssHole! - SAHMD!!!
  I am not a sick, degenerate asshole who likes to beat up
people in wheelchairs, although I have been known to kick
the ass of a one-armed man, given the fact that he may well
be the guy who murdered Richard Kimble's wife...
  Thus, I feel it incumbent upon myself to give an honest
account of my life of crime, so that the Law Enfarcement
Offals and Persecuting Attorneys who have, so far failed miserably over the years in bringing me to Officially
Recognized Justice (TM), will have a fighting chance of
throwing my sorry ass in a dark hole until Hell freezes
over, by portraying me as the sorry, pathetic, psychotic,
monstrous, criminal, scum-bag piece of shit that I am, in Reality (TM).
  First, however, I would like to insert an totally upaid
advertisement for the DigitalRainbowRevolutionaryFamily
gathering at the Plaza Hotel in Lost Wages at the end of
July (I think).
  It's some kind of hacker's conference (I think), and they
have a Spot The Narc (or somesuch) contest (I think) during
the conference.
  I have all the details on a faded copy of an email to
the CypherPunks list that I printed out, but all of my
valueable research material is currently fused together,
due to it being hastily thrown into the back of my truck,
and then rained on, during my Fright From Fleedom Japanese Toulist Tlap that was inspired by my receiving indications that the abundant overgrowth that Government Authorities intended to mow down was not, as I had thought, in my back yard, but on my butt. [WAS: Stick Around, Pal, And our Ass Is Grass!]
  Anyway, despite the fact that I cannot even remember
the proper name or date of the conference (although I
have no problem remembering the name of the Plaza Hotel,
since it is the home of the Penny Slot Machines which
enable one to gamble feverishly for hours with the loose change they have scraped off the floor of their
vehicle, after having lost all the money they got by
pawning their grandmother's wedding ring), I have made
arrangements, during my recent Soft Kmart Tour Of
America, to have the winner of the conference's Spot
The Snark contest awarded a highly polished and fully
functional BackDoor into the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police computer system.
  The award, to be presented by the Offical Mascot of the
Spot The Snark contest, "Spot, the Snipe," unfortunately
does not have the immense value that one might think,
since it has been devalued by the recent proliferation
of a large number of BackDoors into Canadian Government
computer systems. Nonetheless, it will undoubtedly be
the source of countless hours of entertainment for the
lucky winner.
  The award to be presented in Lost Wages has officially
been named the 'Jim Bell InterNetional Back Door Revenge
Scholarship To The School Of Hard Knocks Cafe."
  It is an Army of Dog Scholarship meant to impress on
the Controllers that PayBack, like Oppression, has now
entered the Global Information Monitoring Age, and that the New Secret Squirrel Disorder is alive and well in ButtFuck, Canada.
{ If you can't fuck the one that fucked you, fuck someone
 that fucked someone else, and vice-versa, ad infinituum.}
  In short, any ShortLimpDickedPrick in ButtFuck, Canada,
can no longer be certain that HisOrHer violation of both
the laws of the land and the laws of human decency will
go unpunished, or that the Anonymous Avenger will not be
an entity totally unknown to them, from a distant place
such as Seattle, with little known connection to the
time and place of a monstrous crime against Monstrous
Oppressors. And, on the other hand (which has warts), when strange things begin to happen in the Seattle Court computer system, strangely connected to the StrangeButTrue! persecrotchion of a StrangeBedFellow of the Author,
James C. "The 'C' Stands For Dalton" Bell, the only
thing that Sharon can guarantee in Stone, is that the
obvious suspects at ASIX, the adopted parents of the
Author's SparCard II, have absolutely nothing to do
with the eerie laugh of Vincent 'Cate' Price echoing
through their system, since the Army of Dog doesn't
shit in it's own back yard (although it sometimes
pees in its kitchen sink, when the oung is occupied).
  In honor of the Royal Rogers Stuffed & Mounted Police currently celebrating their 150th birthday, I recently decided to present them with the ultimate gift.
  Realizing that I was far from alone in my position of
never being convicted of something I was actually guilty
of (we may not be guilty of breaking the law, but we are
all guilty of *something*--that's in the Bible, I think),
I came to the conclusion that the perfect birthday present
to the RCMP, on the occasion of being awarded their 150th consecutive 'Fascist Oppressor With The Best Public Image
Award,' would be to hand them my head on a silver platter,
enabling them to convict me on a charge of which I am
completely innocent (from a technical, legal standpoint),
and provide them with all of the information necessary
to ensure my Public Labelization (I won a game of Scrabble
with that word, once) as an Officially Recognized Monster,
as seen on 'Cops,' '60 Minutes,' 'Canada's Least Wanted,'
and 'World's Slowest Police Chases: The Return Of Beyond
The Valley Of The Planet Of Al Cowling.'
  I had originally intended for my gift to the RCMP to be
a professional, polished MultiMedia Entertainment Special,
but, since the thieving fucks stole my Toshiba Tecra in order to attempt to shut me the fuck up, I am forced to
hoist myself on my own petard in a strictly ASCII computer
environment (without a spell checker or thesaurus, so there
is little likelihood of my being able to discover, through
inference, what a petard actually is, or whether I have
spelled it ccoorreeccttllyy).
  Accordingly, the passages of the following chapters which
will describe in perverse, grotesque and disgusting detail
the nature of my crimes against sexual normality, will *not*
be accompanied with graphic, color illustrations, leaving the reader to use their own imagination, or to pay $ .01 per
minute by dialing 1-800-EAT-T0T0, to hear a heavy-breathing
tape-loop which provides excellent background stimulation
for the sexual imagination, as long as you can ignore the
fact that it is the tape of the Author, a sex-pack a day
chain-smoker, climbing a single flight of stairs.
  In the following chapter, the Author, still suffering
under the delusion that someone, somewhere, is reading
this tripe (besides college students attempting to gain
extra credits in a summer session psycho-ology class
titled, "An Analysis Of The Results Of Extensive Brain
Damage Caused By MKULTA Experiments On The Half-Unwitting
Author--Current Technology Cannot Detect Any Difference"),
provides complete details of HisOrHer first annual major
drug-deal, just as Canadian Authorities always suspected,
but could never prove.

I think you're a bit out of line. Wish you well and all of that. Strength that is.
  A "bit" out of line?
  I'm trying to be *way* out of line, but I guess I'm a failure
at that, too .
  Children of the 60's can all remember where they were when they
heard about JFK being shot. Many of them can remember where they
were when they bought their first pound of pot, and most of them
can remember where they were when they sold their first pound of
pot (particularly if they got busted in the process.)
  I bought my first pound of pot in a public park in Edmonton,
Alberta. I needed to sell it to get the money to pay a fine for
drug possession, and I couldn't, in good conscience, pay it with
money that I'd earned by working for a living at my regular job.
  Let me explain...
  It was the summer of 1969...
 [Debitor's Bad Note: If 90% of the events in the Author's life
  seem to have somehow occurred in 1969, this might be the result
  of the massive electroshock and hypnosis treatments HeOrSheOrIt
  underwent under the...care...of an MKULTA physician in Saskatoon,
  Saskatchewan, Abram Hoffer, who undoubtedly appears as only a
  minor, peripheral figure, if at all, in most literature on the
  subject...likely as a result of great care being taken by shadowy
  background figures to keep him out of the limelight, ala Kim   Philby, due to the fact that the record of his 'personal history'
  seems to be unable to withstand close scrutiny once one begins to
  investigate the time periods preceding the end of WWII.
  Hhhmmmm...]
  Quit interrupting, Dogamnnit!
  Anyway, I was working in orkton, Saskatchewan and living with a
sixteen year old high school student with no parents, no job, no
source of income, who always paid his share of the rent, and always
had better clothes and more spending money than me. [It turned out
that he had two motto's in life. 1)Everything that isn't nailed down,
is mine. 2)Anything I can pry loose, isn't nailed down...]
  The apartment we shared tended to be a hang-out for a variety of
local high-school kids, who would invariably bring by any interesting
characters passing through town on the couch circuit, who needed a
place to crash for the night. One of these characters was Frank
Skanks, an older fellow.
  The drug scene in orkton was basically a Virtual Drug Scene, where
most people knew somebody who knew somebody who had once copped a
bag of weed on a trip with their parents to Vancouver, and shared
it with a few close friends on their return.
  Upon Franks arrival, however, things picked up, and a few of the
local kids suddenly seemed to have access to a fair amount of smoking
dope. There even seemed to be some acid floating around.
  I returned home one evening to find a bottle of wine in the fridge,
and had several large glasses before 'the gang' returned from a trip
to the Dairy Queen, whereupon they became dismayed to find that I
had consumed such a large portion of a concoction they had prepared
in accordance with Ken Kesey's directions in 'The Electric Kool-Aid
Acid Test.'
  That seemed to explain the fact that I was able to pick up Messages
trouble doing before...
  I found it to be a fairly pleasant experience, even though I did
feel a slight bit of guilt, knowing that I had inadvertantly setback
the plans of a dozen or so people who had hoped to get high with the
portion of Dr. Skank's Magic Elixir which I had unwittingly consumed.
  I didn't mind being 'dosed,' since I had already figured on trying
LSD on the proverbial SomeDay. When my enlightened reverie was
interrupted, however, by the sight of Frank Skanks teaching a group
of thirteen-to-fifteen year olds how to tie-off and shoot up, my
pleasant experience took on a rather sour note.
  When my efforts to put a stop to the proceedings failed, largely
due to the rush of young children knocking me down in order to get
a good place in the line that was forming, waiting for Frank to find
one of his few remaining good veins, I decided that, in the interests
of saving at least a single child, I would  call on Dudley DoRight for help.
  I walked to the local RCMP station, dodging the dinosaurs and hobbits which seemed to be everywhere, in a multitude of colors,
and proceeded to inquire as to whether they might be interested
in helping to postpone a group of young teenagers' entry into the
world of needles and spoons and basement rooms until a later age,
when they might be in a position to make better judgements in that
  After throwing me in a jail cell, and grabbing a wide variety of
heavy weaponry, a quickly assembled RCMP assault force rushed out
the door, to 'save the children.' I had the uneasy feeling that they
were intent on saving them even if it meant killing them.
  I didn't get any sleep that night, undoubtedly as a result of the
fact that I was 'tripping for twelve,' and I could hear a lot of
muffled, semi-legible conversations taking place on the far side
of the walls, or door. They didn't seem to make sense, and I assumed
that it was because of my temporary residence of planets of another
  The clearest verbal communication I heard, as the door to the jail
cells was opened, was, "Wrong door!"
  I don't know who spoke those words, but I imagine that it was one
of the Mounties in the company of Frank Skanks, who was staring at
me with extremely wide eyes, and with excrement obviously filling his shorts in less time that it take to utter, "Can you say *cop*! Sure you can..."
  I was totally dumbfounded, as well as still extremely wasted, but
I still managed to smile, and say, "Nice suit, Frank." before the
door closed and the conference which had apparently just broken up
was quickly reconvened.
  Being young and naieve, I thought that this was the end of the
story, an interesting story I would someday be able to tell my
grandchildren, after DNA testing showed my denials of paternity to
be outright lies.
  What I didn't understand, at the time, was that my surprise at
finding that the Great Canadian Hero, Dudley DoRight, was somehow
involved in something which seemed to run contrary to the Official
Movie Mythology, would soon be supplanted by total incredulity that
the spot of shit I had observed on the end of Dudley's Dick would
soon prove to be a massive amount of shit covering the RCMP members'
members all the way to their pelvis, and dripping down off thier
balls into their rubber boots.
  And the shit would smell an awful lot like mine...
  The Official Story was that, after performing a search of my
apartment, and finding nothing, the RCMP returned with members
of the force who were more 'experienced' in this area, who, lo and behold, found a single joint in a suit-jacket pocket.
  I was charged with possession of marijuana.
  Tiny, a member of the Apollos Motorcycle Club in Regina, who Frank
had travelled into town with, had apparently told Frank to 'fuck off'
when asked to introduce him to individuals throughout the province,
with Frank paying travelling expenses and providing spending money
during the trips. Tiny was willing to testify in court as to Franks
apparent instigation of illegal activities on behalf of some entity
who seemed to be funding him.
  A few days before the trial, we were pulled over by the Mounties,
who took Tiny into their police car to have a chat with him. Upon
his return, Tiny told me that it was suggested to him that if I got
off on the charge, that they would have to find someone else to take
the fall, and that he was next in line. Tiny assured me that he would
still be there for the trial.
  Bye, Tiny...
  In order to convict me of possession of a single joint, the RCMP
sent two Mounties to my hometown for a week or so to investigate me,
as well as contacting everyone I have known since birth.
  Although my lawyer had assured me that the case would undoubtedly
be thrown out of court as a result of the RCMP's tacit admission
that a wide variety of individuals had been seen coming and going
from my apartment between the first and second searches (while I
was still in jail), I was convicted, receiving a criminal record
and a $ 300.00 fine (at a time when other people were getting $ 50.00
fines and conditional discharges--no criminal record).
  Being a well-programmed True Believer in Truth, Justice, The Flag,
The National Anthem, Dudley DoRight, Mom's Apple Pie, ad infinituum,
it took me quite a while to fully understand that I had been screwed,
blued and tattoo'd for the crime of...seeing something that I wasn't
meant to see.
  Those who have found themselves subjected to my insane, inane,
wild-eyed rants on the CypherPunks Disturbed Male LISP might be
surprised to know that I didn't, at the time, get 'a bit out of
line,' as  might say.
  As a matter of fact, I pretty much retained my naievity, somehow
convincing myself that this event in my life obviously had to be
some kind of aberration of TheWayThingsAre (TM), or that the RCMP
detachment in orkton had been taken over and subverted by the
Body Snatchers, and that I should just mark it all up to having a
 {I have not come by my cynicism easily, having had it pounded into
  me over the course of the years by a variety of members of our
  Officially Recognized Authorities who deemed that, once I had
  become an OfficiallyLabledBadGuy, I was fair game for anyone who
  was in need of 'someone doing something dirty, decent folks can
  frown on.'}
  Although I will freely admit that I remained, for the time being,
an ignorant, well-programmed middle-class Canadian white boy, I am
rather proud of the fact that I showed a spark of future promise as
an individual capable of evolving into AManWorthyOfBeingCalledAMan,
as Gurdjieff would say, by listening to the voice inside which told
me that there was a line I could not cross and still retain any
semblance of integrity and self-respect.
  I could not, in good conscience, allow these thieves to take my
hard earned money, in payment of the court-ordered fine.
  I was met, after my conviction, on the steps of the courhouse, by
a group of local teenagers, most of whom I did not know, who were
aware that I had never smoked a joint in my life, and had decided
that if I had to do the time, I might as well do the crime.
  The first joint I ever smoked was on the courthouse steps in orkton, Saskatchewan, after having been railroaded into a criminal
conviction in order to prevent my being in a position to speak out
about my inadvertantly gained knowledge of RCMP malefeasance.
  The first pound of weed I ever bought was in a public park in
Edmonton, Alberta, which I sold in orkton, Saskatchewan, in order

I had not only never before done, but had never before seen.

Canadian Shock Radio - SPACE ALIENS HIDE M DRUGS!!!
  Lest anyone think that my rendidion of 'Dudley's Dick In D-Sharp"
might be a bit of sour grapes on my part, let me state, for the record,
that I hold no ill will against the poor, ignorant Nazis in the orkton
division of the RCMP, since basically all they really did was to totally
fuck up their own Karma, while giving me a valuable life-lesson which
may well have been responsible for my making a very important and far-
reaching decision later in my life.
  ears later, as a result of knowing what awaits TheManWhoKnowsTooMuch
I decided to keep my fucking mouth shut about the people and events that
I observed from my position on the ceiling, while looking down on my body and the rest of the room during a particularly intensive electro-
shock experience.   Something told me that I was, once again, inadvertently observing
something that would result in 'measures' needing to be taken by the
RecognizedAndRespectedMembersOfSociety (of which I was not one), in order to ensure that I did not share with others what I had seen while
peeking under the skirt of the GreatWhoreWhoWasWearingNoPanties.
  One of the more disturbing things I perceived while listening to the
rather enlightening conversations taking place among the gathered
civilian and military medical personnel, was something that I have come
to understand rather recently, as a result of research that was begun
after something Tim May mentioned in one of his posts to the CPUNX list.
  I thought it odd, at the time, to observe my being given a long series
of electroshocks in a single session, since it was my understanding that
They (TM) just gave a person one, quick whack, and then hosed the shit
off your sheets and wheeled you into another room to make way for the
next lucky winner. Recent research, however, seems to indicate that
this was a special technique pioneered in Canada by Dr. Ewen Cameron,
MKULTRA's resident wanna-be-Nazi-doctor, in order to wipe his patients'
minds (and identities) 'clean,' in order to prepare them for a rebuilding
of their personality, through a technique called Psychic Driving (which
turns out to be a kindlier, gentler form of Brainwashing--as long as you
are only comparing it to bamboo-shoots under the fingernails and rats
in cages placed over one's face).
  Of course, Dr. Cameron, who retired to great accolade, recognized as
a Titan in Canadian Medical History, as opposed to being tried by an
International Court and sentenced to be hung, like his predecessors at
Dachau, was really only being used as an expendable shill to take the
heat if the shit hit the fan over Rockerfeller Foundation funded CIA/
Military experiments obliterating the minds of women being treated for
such devastating mental disabilities as 'menopause' and 'post-partum
depression.' After all, one could hardly expect the CIA to risk exposure
of the players in the Canadian MKULTRA scene whose pre-WorldWarII alleged
'histories' could not withstand close scrutiny.
  Accordingly, after the shit hit the fan, it was Dr. Cameron who fell
off a cliff while 'climbing'  , while my physician
continued to practice...and practice...and practice...
  Delving into the history of CIA mind-control experiments cleared up a
few things that had been somewhat of a mystery in regard to my medical
treatment over the years, such as how I had ended up being treated with
hypnosis and heavy doses of electroshock when I had originally gone to
see the doctor in regard to a particularly nasty hangnail, and what the
fuck all of those Navy people were doing two thousand miles from the   I'm just kidding, of course...
  The fact is, I *already* knew *what* the fuck all of those Navy people
were doing in Saskatchewan. They were there conferring with Dr. Hoffer's
alleged 'research assistant,' MJ. What I *didn't* know, at the time, was *why*.
  I was not surprised to recently find out, after a modicum of research,
that Ms. MJ Callbeck left the Navy as a nurse lieutenant, specializing
in psychiatric nursing, receiving most of her postgraduate training at
Allan Memorial Hospital in Montreal, from phychiatrists who were, to
put it as delicately as possible...PostWar Refugees From Hitler's Nazi
Germany. (With 'refugee' apparently being defined as a physician who
had escaped trial and hanging at Nuremburg, as a result of having a
wealth of information and 'practical experience' in areas that were of
interest to American and Canadian intelligence agencies.)
  Ms. Callbeck became a 'research nurse' for a research team formed in
Saskatchewan with huge grant from the CIA's Canadian funding front,
the Rockerfeller Foundation, and was awarded a training grant to
visit two U.S. research units funded by the CIA's American funding
front, the Human Ecology Foundation, at Tulane University, in New
Orleans, and the Psychiatric Institute in New ork.
  After MJ's return from the HeartOfMentalDarkness of the MKULTRA
mind-control establishments in the U.S., she created a psychiatric
researching nursing team to 'control' all clinical research for the
team, and to ensure that research protocols would be followed.
  Ms. Callbeck's and Dr. Hoffer's careers were closely intertwined with
Dr. Humphry Osmond, a British Naval doctor sent to Canada to look after
British Naval Intelligence's interests in the North American mind-control
research arena being fronted by the CIA, with their MKULTRA Project, and
Captain Al Hubbard, the Johnny Appleseed of LSD, whose hallucinogenic
pecker-tracks throughout the OSS and the Manhattan Project led to him
receiving a Presidential Pardon from Harry Truman, as well as opening
doors for him to a wide variety of employment with such agencies as the
CIA and the Canadian Special Services.
  As a matter of fact, the chronolgy of the U.S. mind-control experiments
moving beyond U.S. borders, to countries such as Canada, when publicity
and legal technicalities (such as the murder of innocent victims who had
been dosed with hallucinogenic drugs without their knowledge) became a
bit of a 'sticky wicket,' was mirrored in Canada by the careers of Hoffer,
Osmond, Callbeck and Hubbard, who seemed to be at the center of much
of the 'progressive' psychiatric research funded by American and Canadian
military intelligence agencies, but who always managed to somehow exit the scene just before the shit hit the fan, and, as a result, "not get any fon 'em."
{e.g. - Just as Hubbard (who looks surprisingly like my step-grandfather,
 Ray Hubbard) managed to slip out the back door of the Hollywood Hospital
in Vancouver, just as "the Canadian Medical Association was becoming
increasingly suspicious of Hollywood Hospital in the wake of publicity
surrounding MK-ULTRA" (with the Canadian Citizen's Commission on Human
Rights doing a distincly audible "Hhhmmmm..." over discovering a CIA
contract psychiatrist, Dr. Harold Abramson, being on the Board Of Directors of the hospital superintendent's Psychedelic Therapy Assn.),
Dr. Hoffer always seemed to manage to call a 'slant-right' at the exact time that a hole in the line seemed to open up, closing behind
him and leaving the more dispensable players behind to face a legal
and media blitz(krieg) that was more interested in kicking ass and
taking names, than who actually had the ball.
  Naturally, after 1966, when overt legal research into hallucinogenic
therapy was stopped/banned, Dr. Hoffer, who was then Associate Professor
(Research) Psychiatry, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan,
suddenly deemed it time to go into 'private practice,' where his work/
research would not be subject to the scrutiny of his peers and his
employers, who might take a dim view of any connection to what was
now illegal research.
  Ms. Callbeck, Navy Lieutenant, MKULTRA research trainee, also found
it a convenient time to depart the Research Unit at the University of
Saskatchewan, and assist Dr. Hoffer in the research he was pursuing.
  As always, what one finds upon inquiry into JustTheFactsMa'am never
seems to be quite as intruiging as what one *does*not* find...
  For instance, one would expect a person who held such an esteemed
position as Director General Technical Assistance, United Nations,
to include this accolade on his or her Curriculum Vitae, but Dr. Hoffer
does not seem to have done so.
  As well, all research into the details of the position seem to lead
nowhere, except when one makes personal inquiries through people who
were involved with closely connected areas of the UN agency at the
time, and, even then, when one begins to ask more detailed questions
about the involvement-of/relationship-with Kurt Waldheim, etc., people's
memories suddenly get much worse, and, by golly it seems that they can't
seem to remember hardly anything at all, and think that maybe they were
mistaken about what they already told you.
  Of course, when one looks under the dustbins of history, one invariably
finds a few dustballs that remain, as a result of someone forgetting to
do a thourough cleaning, and one finds such gems as a letter from The
Commission For The Study Of Creative Imagination, with such notables/
suspects such as Hoffer, Hubbard, Osmond, Huxley. Smythies, on the Board
of Directors (with Hoffer's UN position highlighted), making inquiries into the Urantia manuscripts which Hitler's Deaths Head troops found
so enamoring. "Our little planet, Urantia, is poised on the brink of an enthralling
epoch of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual
enlightenment -- the threshold of true civilization."
{Of particular interest is the lack of any mention of Reptilian Nazis,
 even though it seems to be common knowledge that Jesus descended into
 the bowels of the earth during his three days of being incommunicado.
 Were there 'basement stairs' in his 'burial' cave?}
  Also curiously missing from all references to the history of psychiatry
and/or hallucinogenic mind-control experimentation in Canada is mention
of an individual whose name I encountered many times in Saskatchewan, and
always in relation to communities which contained major mental health
hospitals or facilities--Frank Skanks.
  The above, of course, is just the tip of the iceberg that one discovers
upon doing a bit of research into known and documented human figures in
the history of mental health research and practice in Saskatchewan.
  If one begins investigations into some of the more shadowy figures who
are usually encountered only when viewing their electroshock treatments
from the ceiling above, or by following them from one's doctor's office
and eavesdropping on them during their lunch, etc., then things get, as
Alice noted, "curiouser and curiouser..."
  Stan, you've still got something hanging from your lip...

I(95)'m An Asshole - SPACE ALIENS HIDE M DRUGS!!!
  Been an asshole all my life...
  I suppose I should keep my obligation to be true to my word and provide
the RCMP with details of my life of crime, in order to help the Canadian
Justice system to compensate for the ignorant incompetence of Canada's
National Internal Police Force.
  I guess it was kind of mean of me to 'confess' to a crime I committed
over a quarter-century ago, on which the Statute Of Limitations has
undoubtedly run out.
  So I'm a belligerant, smart-alec asshole...so sue me!
  Regardless, I feel obligated to give up the Real Goods this time, by
confessing to a more recent crime for which I can undoubtedly be charged,
tried and convicted, without anything remotely resembling True Justice standing in the way...
  Get out the warrant and lick your pen, Dudley, because I confess to being guilty of none other than...Accessory After The Fact To Grand Theft Auto!
  Less than two years ago, nonetheless!
  Personally, I think that Officer Besalt should get the honour of throwing the cuffs on me for this charge, since the actual perpetrator
of the car theft was his good BumBuddyAidsInfestedDrugAddictedInformant,
Ian Wasacase, on whose behalf Officer Besalt, a SorryScumBagPieceOfShit
ThievingPrick (TM) robbed me at gunpoint in full public view, at the
CoalDust Saloon, in Bienfait Saskatchewan.
  RCMP Officer AJ Besalt, a piece of Human Garbage who has the conscience
and intellect of a Slug, not only seems incapable of feeling any sense of
shame in dressing up in his neatly pressed uniform, with his shiny badge
and shoes, and telling a judge, with a straight face, nonetheless, that,
despite his incompetence in being able to produce the proper paperwork
on a DogAtLarge charge that he commanded the plaintiff to appear in court
on, under the threat of armed, physical violence, the case should be
continued, with a new date set, in order for him not to feel like an
incompetent moron for being able to handle a simple DogAtLarge case any
better than he did an attempted DrugBust, ending up having to retrieve
their government informant/agent's DrugBuyFrontMoney at gunpoint from
a citizen who had committed no crime.
  Oh, pardon me...I would hate for anyone to get the *wrong* impression,
  OffalSir Besalt didn't actually mention the part about using a career
criminal and police informant to attempt to frame a disabled person on
a drug charge by using the threat of violence to get him to sell some of
his medication in return for marked money.
  I guess he didn't want to take up the Court's valueable time with
insignificant details.
  Lest the reader believe, Dog forbid, that I am stringing out my sincere
confession in order to torture a poor, pathetic excuse for a human being
by including facts and details that never quite seem to make it into the
Offical Police Reports, I guess I had best get on with supplying the
details of my HeinousCrime.
  I was very young as a child...   OK, really, now...
  Ian Wasacase, former preacher , had come to Estevan to
bestow his blessed presence on his brother, Gilbert, and his family.
He had driven down with his NewImprovedDrugAddictedOldLady and a couple
of friends who were apparently his apprentices in his life of crime.
  As overjoyed as Gilbert and his wife, Peggy, were to see Gilbert's
beloved brother, Ian, they nonetheless that, in the interest of saving
the life of several single children, their own, that it would be best
if Ian and his SpoonFed Roadies were to depart, and thus not further
endangering the lives of the family's children by shooting their AIDS
infested blood all over the floor, walls and ceiling of the bathroom
and the children's bedrooms.
  In consternation with the difficulty of getting the FamilyJunkie and
friends out of his home, Gilbert offered to pay my expenses to make a
trip to Regina, which he knew I needed to do anyway, in return for
leading his brother to believe that I had a medical prescription that
was waiting for me in Regina, which I would be interested in selling
to pick up a little cash.
  It worked like a charm...
  Ian and the SpoonFed Roadies had their belongings packed and were waiting outside, by the vehicles, in 32-seconds flat. (A new world
  Ian's old lady and two friends climbed into my motorhome, explaining
that the heater in the car they had brought didn't work very well, and
we proceeded down the highway, toward Regina, with me following Ian's
car with my motorhome.
  Well, not exactly...
  It turns out that it wasn't Ian's car. It wasn't his old lady's car.
It wasn't either of his friends' car.
  I pretty much figured that out when he pulled over by the side of the
road, motioning for me to stop, and then turned onto a small snow-filled
side road which received no winter maintenance, and proceeded to put the
pedal to the metal, going up and over a railway crossing, and down the
other side into a deep snowbank where the car would be hidden until spring
thaw. My instincts were further confirmed when he appeared, walking back,
with a hammer, a large screwdriver, and the license plates off the car.
  Did I inform the police of this? Did I turn him in?
  Nope...I'm AnAccessoryAfterTheFact.
  To tell the truth, being AnAccessoryAfterTheFact has, thus far, resulted
in far less jail time than any of the attempts I have made during my life
to provide information and/or assistance to those who are officially sworn
to uphold the law.
  It always seems that those who perpetrate crimes are much more informed
on the legal technicalities regarding crimes and criminal proceedings than
those who happen to be standing nearby with their thumb up their ass,
committing crimes only against themselves.
  In the end, it always seems to end up that the person who murdered a
few hundred babies in their crib gets probation in return for turning
State's Evidence against the person who wanders into the room and says,
"Uuuhhh...I really don't think you should be doing this."
  Cynical? Moi?
  Eat my shorts...I'm talking about Real Life (TM) here, boys and girls,
not about Matlock, OK?
  So, there you have it, Dudley.
  A full confession that can be used to convict me, coming from my own
lips (so to speak, although I actually type with my tongue).
  No longer will you have to haul my ass repeatedly into court in vain
attempts to convict me of crimes of which I am not guilty, as a result
of sloppy investigative work and a propensity to ignore the fact that
your witnesses are lying scumbag sacks of shit who would testify against
their own mothers to get out of their own criminal charges.
[EditWhore's Gnote: Since the confession, per se, is complete, members of
 Royal Canadian Mounted Police may want to forgoe reading the rest of my
 diatribe, since it will merely fill in a few small details regarding
 the incompetent, criminal and unconsionable actions of Officer Besalt.]
  Upon reaching Regina, after the commission of my Heinous Crime of
AnAccessoryAfterTheFactToGrandTheftAuto, I decided that I would drop
the GrandTheftAutoPerpetrator, et al, off at their place of residence,
purporting to go pick up my medications and return, to make my fortune
selling them my medications at outrageously low prices.
  Instead, I seemed to get stuck in the driveway behind their house, even
though the snow was not very deep, and I had little trouble driving in.
  After going in the house to warm up and get a shovel, which it turns out they didn't have, Ian took my winter coat to go get a shovel, or some
friends to help, or somesuch. He soon returned without the jacket, without
a shovel, and without any friends. Since it was thirty or forty below zero
and they had no phone, I quickly began to suspect that, since I obviously
wasn't going anywhere, Ian & Company had come to the conclusion that a
bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, and that once they were in
possession of the medication I currently had, then they could look forward
to a bright future in which there might actually be another bird out there
somewhere, in the form of a prescription for further medication.
  Although I would be the last one to heap praise upon Ian for the choices
he has made in his life, neither would I be the first to heap huge amounts
of abuse on him for his character, or lack thereof.
  The reason for this is quite simple...he didn't kill me.
  Ian is a drug addict, with a ferocious habit to feed, and little stength
of character left with which to attempt to avoid falling into total moral
depravity. However, he chose to scam me, steal from me while I slept, and
the like, over the course of several days, instead of just whacking me
over the head with an axe and taking all of my medication.
  This small bit of self-restraint on his part allowed me to split my
supply of medication into small stashes which I could allow him to find
and steal at a rate suitable for keeping his habit in check, and buy me
time for the temperature to rise to a scorching twenty below zero, at
which time I made a break for a friend's house some distance away, and
suffered only minor frostbite in the process.
  As far as Officer Besalt, RCMP, is concerned, however...Fuck That
Sorry Criminal ScumSucking Piece Of Crap In His Dirty Little Asshole!
  Officer Besalt, too ignorant to realize who was grinding the organ,
and who was dancing with the funny hat and the tin cup, brought Ian
down to Estevan in an attempt to bust me for selling my medication.
  ou see, Ian had been working as an informant for the RCMP in other
Saskatchewan districts, enabling the Mounties to arrest and convict
a number of desperados, some of whose crime seemed to be wanting to
kick Ian's ass for fucking their sisters while being AIDS infested,
without telling them.  {In all fairness to the Mounties, Ian's bragging about the people who
  he had screwed over as a police informant indicated that half of them
  were probably guilty of *something*...}
  Thus it was that Ian and his old lady appeared on my doorstep in the
small hamlet of Bienfait, late one night, wanting to purchase some of
my medication. He pulled a wad of money out of his pocket, and seemed
fully prepared to make a buy...
 [Note by AnEditorToBeBustedLater: What it is essential to understand,
  here, is that any individual on the face of the earth, no matter how
  dim-witted, could immediately take one look at Ian, seeing him for
  the first time, and instinctively realize that no matter how desperate
  he was for a fix, even if he had a million dollars in his pocket, he
  would first try every scam in the world to steal whatever drugs a   person had before he would finally break down and actually *buy* them
  in an honest, straightforward deal.]
  I stood there looking at the cash in his hand, mentally visualizing
a picture of Dudley DoRight where the Queen's picture normally is, and
immediately came to three quick conclusions:
1) The motherfucker *owed* me for the several hundred dollars that it
took for me to replace my tires and get my motorhome mobile again.
(Not to mention the thousand or so dollars of damage he did to the
 interior while tearing it apart, looking for drugs.)
2) Ian was only holding forth $ 40.00, out of the several hundred in
his possession, obviously intending to purchase a couple of pills,
stash the rest of the money in his sock, and pick up a couple of hundred
bucks in spare change, over and above what the RCMP were paying him to
help frame innocent people.
3) Since Ian was totally incapable of going more than a few hours without
drugs, he undoubtedly had some in his possession (probably provided by
the Dudley DoRight Pharmacutical Company), and that if I didn't do a
deal with him, he might very well stash the forty bucks in my house on
his way out, and turn over a few pills of his private stash as evidence
against me.
  I don't like jail...never have...never will...
  Regardless, there was not a snowball's chance in hell that I was going
to pass up an opportunity to fuck Ian out of forty bucks.
  I snatched the $ 40.00 out of his hand, and said, "OK! I'll meet you
at the CoalDust Saloon in ten minutes. I've got the shit stashed outside."
  Ian knew I was scamming him, but he wasn't sure how. Neither was I, but
I had ten minutes to figure it out...
Basic Rules Of Life If your's is the strength of ten, because your heart is pure, and you are
working for the Forces of Light...never pull your scams in a dark alley.
Dark alleys are for criminals, and the criminal with the badge and the
gun invariably win the battle.
Basic Rules Of Life Criminals are afraid of the light...even criminals with badges and guns.
"Sunshine is the best disinfectant." ~ Judge Louis Brandeis
  I went to the CoalDust Saloon, and used one of the twenties to buy a
beer for myself and Ian. Ian wanted me to give him the drugs, and I told
him to hold on for a minute.
  I walked over to the change machine by the Video Lottery Terminals and
put the other twenty and the beer change in, turning them into loonies.
I gave Ian ten of the Loonies.
  I proceeded to put the rest of the Loonies into a VLT machine and begin
  Ian asked me where the drugs were. I told him to fuck off. He looked
hurt and hung around like a kicked puppy, while his old lady made a call
on the pay phone.
  Officer Besalt walked through the door of the CoalDust Saloon a few
minutes later.
[eah, yeah, it's me again: The RCMP cover a lot of territory in a thinly
 populated area, around Estevan, and thus it takes them a considerable  amount of time to respond to calls. It may take them several hours to
 respond to a traffic accident, or thirty minutes to an hour to respond  to serious crimes late at night. If they walk through the door five
 minutes after being called, it is because they were sitting around
 the corner, and waited for four minutes before getting out of their
 vehicle and coming in.]
  Officer Besalt needed to get the Mountie's DrugFrontMoney back while
pretending it was Ian's money.
  Lottsa luck...
  We discussed the situation, as I sat playing the VLT, and I quite simply
told the OffalSir that Ian had offered me money to buy drugs from me and
that I had taken it, since he owed me hundreds of dollars for having slashed my tires in order to hold me hostage and steal my drugs in Regina.
  Unfortunately, I didn't use the word 'taken.' I told OffalSir Besalt
that I had 'snatched' the money from Ian's hand, whereupon both Besalt
and I knew that he was now free to fuck with me if I did not return the
money, since I had implied that Ian might not have relinquished the money
totally voluntarily.
  Although I was between a rock and a hard place, not having the money,
there *is* a Dog! I hit a minor jackpot that gave me forty bucks.
  As I waited for the barmaid to cash in my ticket and bring me the money,
I made a point of going into great detail, loud enough for everyone nearby
to hear, about how the person on whose behalf the RCMP Officer was shaking
me down was a drug addict who was attempting to make a drug buy from me,
and how I was unwilling to commit the crime, desiring only to receive the
money that he owed me for slashing my tires and holding me hostage in
severe winter conditions in the BigCity.
  "Sunshine is the best disinfectant."
The Bottom Line:
  OffalSir Besalt is a sorry, scumbag Nazi piece of shit with no better
morals or conscience than to try to use a lying, conniving criminal scam-
artist who has provided countless Canadian youth with hard drugs while
working as a paid RCMP agent/informant, to attempt to entrap a mentally
disabled individual into committing a crime by selling his medications
in order to prevent once again being victimized by a lifetime criminal.
  Oh, yeah...and *I* have never murdered anyone by giving them AIDS
while being under the legal protection of the RCMP.
Non-Adobe PostScript:
  One of the more humorous aspects of the Ian Wasacase Saga was a news
story in the Regina Leader Post in regard to the RCMP's ultra-secret
informant/witness in the trial of four(?) men accused of armed robbery
(and murder?).   After describing the individual's identity being cloaked by his
participation in the Witness Protection Program, the Leader Post, toward
the end of the article, revealed Ian's name.
  Duuhhh...
  Ian is now serving hard time in a Manitoba prison as a result of a
multitude of armed robberies he committed while working under the
protective umbrella of the RCMP.
{Undoubtedly hoping that his cellmates don't have a subscription to
 the Regina Leader Post.}
  Officer Besalt is serving hard time as a result of being trapped in
the mind and body of an Ignorant Nazi Fuck (TM).
{Undoubtedly too fucking ignorant to realize that he would be much better
 off being Ian Wasacase.}

Arty Farcer, Intelligence - SPACE ALIENS HIDE M DRUGS!!!
  Professer Stephen Grossman, chief cognitator at Boston University's
Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems, has created Thing1 and
Thing2--robots which can adapt to their environment by mastering
approach and avoidance behavior.
  He states, "The networks we're building here learn from examples and
exhibit some capability for generalization beyond the training data we've put into them."
  Brian Fitzgerald, in the Summer 1998 issue of Bostonia, points out that
the "neural networks enable the robots to teach themselves...predict
impending impacts, and use the same patterns to suppress movements that
would cause collisions."
  It seems to me that the same technology could be used to instigate
movements that would *cause* collisions...
  Let's say, for instance, that AMadScientistFromEstevanNamedEarlier
had developed a program which could use data from the power usage of
oil-well pumping stations to predict approaching mechanical failure,
and enable the owners to schedule maintenance, thus saving the major
cost of down-time and mechanical failures which were costly due to
breakdown affecting more than the original faulty part.
  Let's also say that a Fucking Idiot who swatted a fly on top of his
exposed hard drive, with a newspaper, fucking it up, mechanically, also
discovered that he could 'fix' the internal arms of the hard drive by
writing a program that made the skinny little internal arms of the
drive work their way, over and over again, toward the faulty area, from
alternating sides of the bad spot.
  Let's further speculate that the Fucking Idiot speculated that any
computer part that could be mechanically 'fixed' by a repetitive program
could also be mechanically 'fucked' by a repetitive program, and that
the SickFuck had friends who knew everything there is to know about
the internal workings of computer hardware peripherals, mean-time between
failures, and all manner of little-known facts about good and bad design
techniques in a wide range of computer hardware fields.
  Lastly, let's speculate that some very BadMenAndWomen with BigGuns
had stolen the SickFucker's computer, and his nephew's computer, and
that he had access to the ThievingPricks' computer systems.
  Thus, if it came to pass that the SickFuck could supply his friends
with the details of the computer hardware and peripherals used by the
BadMenAndWomenWithBigGuns, then his friends could write programs which
would put extra strain on the known weak points of the system, drastically
lowering the mean-time between failures.
  If the SickFuck had already tested his friend's programs on $ 50.00
used computers he had purchased in Regina, Saskatchewan, then they would
have already been able to tweak the programs into little SickFuck Digital
Roe&WadeBots which would be able to perform mechanical abortions at any
stage of DigitalLabor, thus being able to control the failure rate in
imperceptible increments over a wide range of systems, so that, over the
course of a year, it would cost the BadMenAndWomenWithBigGuns millions of
dollars by the time they figured out that the SickFuck had his Richard
shoved up their asshole.
  If the SickFuck's friends in LostAlamo were BrilliantSickFucks, they
might even take it upon themselves to develop a program capable of keeping
track of how the maintainers of various computer systems would deal with
different problems (e.g. 'fixing' vs. 'replacing') and create their little
BrilliantSickFuckPrograms to learn how to force the computer maintainers
to 'replace' the hardware shortly after they had spent their time and
resources 'fixing' the hardware.
  Lastly, if the BrilliantSickFucks were very grateful to the SickFuck
for providing them with information which would enable them to write
what one would think would be incredibly complex programs in the space
of a few short hours, the BrillianSickFucks might provide the SickFuck
with simple device-drivers which could use such unlikely hardware as
printers and programmable keyboards to automatically renew backdoors
into compromised systems in the event the backdoor was found and removed.
[Debitor's Note: T. Arthur, after working with the first version of M$
 Word which made use of macro's, realized the potential for using them
 for distributing Ribbed Trojan Horses, and Digital Simplex Viruses.
 T. Arthur, being a nice fellow, took the time and trouble to phone
 M$ Support, wait on the line for 342 hours, and inform them that there
 was a possible problem with their program being able to transmit RTH's
 and DSV's.
 The M$ UnSupportive RepresentativeOfTheM$AttitudeAtTheTime, was gracious
 enough to take time out of his busy schedule to launch into a long and
 acidic beration of T. Arthur as a neophyte computer idiot who was unaware
 that everyone in the industry *knew* that "you can't get a virus from  opening a text file."
 When T. Arthur related this incident to a group of LostBoys&Girls who
 were solving all of the problems of the computer industry, for all of
 eternity, using pitchers of Margueritas at the Holiday Inn Bar in  Albuquerque to keep their GreyMatterCPU's from overheating, more than
 one of those gathered pointed out that T. Arthur's brain was running
 on 12-Volts/DC, because most of them had figured out the potential for
 the 'Macro Virus' (to be 'discovered' years later), "before the program's
 shrink-wrap had hit the floor."]
  Doc Watson, on a grand summer day in Austin, Texas, walked into the
Armadillo Beer Garden while I was playing a song he wrote, 'Tennessee
Stud,' which has a classic guitar riff, which everyone imitates.
  Doc complimented me on my rendition of his tune, noting that he was
impressed with my unique 'interpretation' of his famous riff, and that
he found it refreshing to hear someone doing something other than the
standard autobot version.
  Being the TruthMonger, I was forced to admit to him that I had first
tried to 'rip off' his licks from the album, but, being a really crappy
guitar player, I was forced to improvise.
  It's the story of my life...
  Although it is True (TM) that I am TheWorld'sForemostComputerExpert,
I am pretty much only 'expert' in very bizarre areas of computer hardware
and software technology. (In the 'regular' areas of technology, I am only
'expert' in the sense of availing myself of tools, such as those that are
produced by Peter Norton, that allow one to fix the most complicated of
computer problems by following the instructions on the screen, and hitting
the  button.)
  I had the good fortune to learn about computers from a gentleman who
helped design the Adam motherboards, and to learn about how computers
and softwear 'think' by working with retarded and otherwise disabled
children for many years.
  Thus I realize the flaw in the widespread notion that certain computers
or programs are 'intuitive.' No...they are fucking retarded, OK?
  Aside from neural networks, and other forms of artificial intelligence,
computers and programs are only 'intuitive' in a situational-specific
way. A database program designed to help you balance your books is quite
simply programmed to anticipate such things as your desire to use integers
and decimals, etc. It is not 'intuitive' if you try to use it to program
your breakfast schedule. Neither is a database program designed to help
you program your breakfast schedule likely to be 'intuitive' as to whether
you might want to eat 1.3 eggs, as opposed to offering you a window which
allows you to choose between poached, fried or scrambled.
  To confuse the issue of what I am getting at, here, I would like to
point out that, although I am 'learned' in the C-Programming Language,
having studied it in various systems of higher education, I can't write
a single fucking line of code...
  Offer me a million dollars to properly write and compile the standard
'hello.c' program, and a week of work will result in my coming up, best
case scenario, a program which echo's, "Nice try, ShitForBrains."
  et, give me a backup tape-drive which is 'Supported' by SCO Unix,
but which doesn't actually work, for myself or for anyone else on the
face of the earth, and I can go through a thousand lines of source code
to find and fix the problem (three years ahead of the SCO engineers who
are 'talking to' Colorado Systems engineers, who will 'fix' the problem
exactly one week before the model becomes obsolete).
  Another example which doesn't really connect to any of the other things
I am talking about here (unless you already know what I am talking about,
which *I* don't), is the fact that I found a lot of the early password
programs to be easily breakable merely by noting how long it took the
program to return results after checking various values input.
  Similarly, I couldn't help but notice that accessing certain 'hacking'
websites on the InterNet results in a 'loading-time' which is way out of
sync with the amount of data, etc., being transferred. (Or that some of
these websites seem to result in a lot of hard drive activity which can
only be noticed by paying attention to the 'sound' of the hard drive,
since the hard drive light doesn't seem to go on, at all. Hhmmm...)
  My point?
  Read the original Sun Operating System Manuals...the Writing Device
Drivers manuals, in particular.
  ou will be left with the distinct impression that AbsoluteSecurity (TM)
is impossible! et, if you peruse later versions of the manuals, right up
to the current versions, you might notice that they no longer leave the
reader with the impression that AbsoluteSecurity (TM) is VaporWare.
  What has changed? Nothing...
  While resurrecting my Opus SparCardII after years of disuse, I found
that the little-bitty BatteryGremlins that reside within the CPU chips
had passed away from old-age.
  Thus I had to become an EEPROM expert over the next few days, in order
to learn how to tell it to do things like remember its own name, etc.
("What's your name, Bob? Starts with a 'B' and ends with a 'B'...you've
 got five seconds, Bob.")
  I'm dense/stupid/ignorant/clueless, added to which, I am usually loaded
while working on my computers late at night.
  Thus, I make a lot of mistakes. And I find out some of the most amazing
fucking things!
(e.g. In the DOS 3.3 days, before most of you were born, my Drunken  Fingers (TM) discovered that 'dir *.' would list directories and files  without an extension, although this didn't seem to be documented
 anywhere. I was pretty impressed with myself until I discovered that
 if my Drunken Fingers accidentally added a certain other keystroke to
 this combination, then something happened which did irreplaceable
 damage to a certain version of BIOS. I was once again impressed with
 myself upon finding that, although most programs would no longer run
 on the computer, database programs 'smoked' at about ten times the
 speed they usually ran. Why? Don't know...don't care.)
  What I'm really-really getting at, here, is this:
  Except e become as a little, drunken child...
  The reason that it is the teens and pre-teens that are hacking into
'secure' government and corporate computers is that they can't afford
to take the $ 5,000.00 computer classes/seminars that 'teach' them what
can, and cannot, be done.
  The reason I can roam at will through Canadian Government 'secure'
computer systems is that I am a sorry, fucking asshole, whose Drunken
Fingers know more about computers than my Drunken Mind ever will.
  The reason that Echelon can monitor and analyze all of the electronic
communications on the face of the earth, is that they know that the
nature of BIOS, EEPROM, Device-Drivers, etc., is such that, given even
the slightest amount of influence over standards and procedures in the
design and implementation of these things, they will contain series
of MasterKeys which can open a variety of BackDoors, no matter how
complex and well-designed the features of hardware and software that
overlay the basic computer technology and processes.
  The reason that I can use RCMP printers to do my bidding on thier
computer systems is that I don't make them do things that they are
not supposed to do, thereby creating SoreThumbs that stick out where
they shouldn't and exhibit signs of dysfunctional pain and suffering
when new programs or updates are added to the mix, but rather, I ask
them to do things that they are *supposed* to do, but haven't been
asked in the manner which I ask them, because those who designed them
only wanted them to do silly, useless tasks, like print words on a sheet
of paper.
Read This Again:
  Professer Stephen Grossman, chief cognitator at Boston University's
Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems, has created Thing1 and
Thing2--robots which can adapt to their environment by mastering
approach and avoidance behavior.
  He states, "The networks we're building here learn from examples and
exhibit some capability for generalization beyond the training data we've put into them."
  Brian Fitzgerald, in the Summer 1998 issue of Bostonia, points out that
the "neural networks enable the robots to teach themselves...predict
impending impacts, and use the same patterns to suppress movements that
would cause collisions."
Now Think About This:
  If I can find ways to make/enable computer hardware and software perform a wide variety of tasks that was not envisioned by those who
designed them, honestly being merely a semi-computer-literate dweeb
without the sense Dog gave a Goose, then what is to prevent people
who are learned and competent in computer technology and processes
from adapting the capability and functions of computer technology
and processes to ends which go far beyond the simplistic techniques
which they have been programmed/trained to apply to the tasks they
  More importantly, if, with my own limited knowledge and computer
literacy/competency, I can find ways to route around the damage caused
by the secrecy/censorship of information that others are using to cause
me problems in my life, then what are the possibilities for those who
are involved in the design and implementation of computer technologies
and processes, to design and develop hardware and software that can
be modified/circumvented/paralyzed/compromised if their use becomes
usurped by the Controllers in order to provide Power&Control to an
Elite Segment of Society?
  There is currently a thread on the CypherPunks Mailing List which is
discussing the Perjury of RecognizedAuthority being treated differently
than that of Jane and Joe Citizen.
  Perusing Perry Mezger's post, I was impressed with the thoughtfulness
and insight that he displayed on the issue, and the quality of questions
he raised in regard to ethics and public attitudes in this area.
  Nonetheless, if you ask Tim C. May to check the archives, I think he
will find that I previously dealt with this issue in a simple and a
succinct manner.
  I stated, quite simply, that what I found most disturbing was not that
our elected political representatives and a wide variety of government
employees, public, private and corporate figures were in the habit of
lying, but that they no longer even bothered to tell GoodLies (TM).
  The bottom line is that it doesn't matter whether you've wrecked daddy's
car, or you are cheating on your spouse, the cost of telling the Truth
grows faster than the interest you owe on a loan from a guy named 'Big
  The longer that the citizenry avoids confronting THE LIE, in order to
prevent rocking the boat, since "Things aren't really that bad." (ET!),
then the larger the weight of the BadLies will become, and the more they
will become an 'accepted' part of our everyday reality.
  The longer that those involved in computer design and implementation
deliver products which reflect only what they are asked to produce to
meet certain, narrow goals, then the greater will become the end-user's
reliance on, and vulnerability to, those who have the money and the
power to set standards and influence the directions and goals of future
computer use.
  In effect, what I am saying, is that if those involved in the design
and the implementation of computer hardware and software technology, standards and processes are not able to "learn from examples and exhibit some capability for generalization beyond the training data...put into them," as well as to "predict impending impacts, and use the same patterns to suppress movements that would cause collisions," then
they might as well pledge allegience to Thing1 and Thing2, because
they will do whatever the GreatBeast programs them to do, and it will
be little comfort to those crushed underfoot to know that those who
fed the GreatBeast at the expense of WeThePeople were "just following
  "They wanted to come for the Jews, and I wasn't a Jew, so I wrote the
  Surprisingly, most of the people I know who are most concerned about
designing hardware and software that resembles a two-sided coin which
can be turned against its Masters, if they become rabid and frothing at
the mouth, work for high-security government and corporate agencies
who go to great lengths to implement 'access enhancement features' in
their products.
  The common consensus among them seems to be that the average designer
and programmer can implement sane and effective 'enhancements' to their
products with very little effort, simply by being consious of the myriad
of opportunities, that are constantly present, to 'add' certain features
which lend themselves to include user-friendly control of the product.
  As well, they recognize that those who actually *do* the programming
are often much more aware of what design features they can include that
will allow other programmers to produce add-ons or tie-ins which will
allow the end-user to be a participant in their software's functionality,
as opposed to riding a one-way train whose ultimate destination will be
Government and Corporate Auschwitz.
  I currently have what might be considered Unauthorized Access to a
variety of computer systems, which could theoretically result in my
being subject to a few million years in prison.
  However, thanks to the wisdom and foresight of a few Computer Angels
who design and program high-security government and corporate systems,
I was able to gain access by doing nothing more than simply give myself
the same 'network privileges' as held by those who chose to make my
computer a part of their network, in order to read my files and put in
place programs of their choosing.
{Ownership of my computer bestows upon me the right to set my privileges
 to whatever level I desire, and if that allows me the same privileges
 throughout a computer network I was linked to with the full consent
 of those in charge of it, then I can hardly be faulted for assuming
 that I have authorization to use the resources and information that is
 available on 'our' network.}
  The bottom line, as far as I am concerned, is that the InterNet, by
definition, is an InterActive Medium.
  Those who choose to participate in the InterActivity of the Medium
must be prepared to encounter individuals who wish to exercise their
right to participate in the exchange of resources and information, as
opposed to being a passive recipient of whatever the other party, in
their egoistical imaginings of superior position and authority, wish
to bestow upon them.
  Anyone who wishes to join their computer to mine in order to check for
dirt under my fingernails had best wash the shit off of their dick before
they do so...
  It is understandable that those who design computer hardware and
software would take pains to provide their employers with a product
which empowers them.
  However, if they ignore, or pass upon, available opportunities to
empower the end-users, clients and customers of their employers, then
the public becomes, not *beneficiaries* of the designers efforts, but
*victims* of their efforts.
The rEvolution is NOW!

  As Trooper said, "We're here for a good time, not a long time, so have
a good time, the sun doesn't shine every day."
  The reason that the general public is absolutely terrified of being
confronted with the Truth (TM) and Reality (TM) is that they know that
it is a Horrifying Beast capable of ripping their Perceived World View
to shreds and destroying any hope they might have of attaining peace
of mind and tranquillity of soul in this lifetime.
  What the average person doesn't realize, however, is that when you make
the supreme effort to face the Truth, whatever it may be, you will find
yourself laughing like a fucking banshee.
  our Body, Mind and Soul *will* be subjected to a violent, excruciating
pain beyond human endurance, but your Spirit will laugh its ass off...
  When I first read about the InterNet being created by the military, in
order for scientists, researchers, et al, to be able to freely exchange
information in a secure environment, I recognized that they were doing
so with the goal of being able to totally access the complete spectrum
of educational and scientific progress and development.
  I took it as a given that their purpose in providing a communal forum
for exchange of information was to have complete access to, and control
over, that information.
  To me, this is as plain as night and day. I think it is ludicrous for
supposedly intelligent individuals to have failed to recognized this fact
until the presence of Echelon became public. Well, to be more precise,
until Official Government Recognition of the reality of Echelon's wide-
ranging presence became public.
  Of course, I had the advantage of having had the opportunity to become
acquainted with the military's attitude toward, and plans for, the public
and its individual citizens by finding myself at the forefront of their
experimentation in monitoring and controlling the minds of the citizenry,
as well as directing their thoughts, beliefs and attitudes according to
their own desires and goals.
  My original insight into this arena of life came from a perspective of
watching and listening, from the ceiling, the medical and scientific
researchers who were below me, casually engaged in manipulating and
modifying the physical tool which they seemed to believe held the secret
to control of my mind.
  I gained additional insight into the aims of the Controllers by making
a point of developing self-hypnosis tapes which I used to override the
subconsious suggestions of Dr. Fogel, one of Dr. Hoffer's associates,
before submitting to his hypnosis 'treatments.'
  If anyone finds some of the things I say a bit odd, then think about
how 'odd' they would have sounded twenty-or-so years ago.
  I have recently read much of the InterNet literature on CIA and military
mind-control experiments, etc., and found it quite humorous the lengths
to which those providing information went to document and verify each and
every instance of what they were describing, and the claims that they were
making, yet still maintaining a subtle undercurrent of "No! Really! I
wouldn't shit you! This stuff is *true*, I tell you! TRUE!!!"
  I find it equally humorous that so many of those who have obviously
spent a great deal of time, effort and resources to uncover/discover
the enormous extent of government research and experiments into mind-
control somehow manage to keep from screaming "BullShit!" at the claims
of those involved that they spend decades and millions of dollars in this
area without making any progress, whatsoever, and that they just happened
to have stopped all research and experimentation in mind-control the very
Tuesday before a Congressional (or whatever) investigation decided it was
not a good thing, and they shouldn't be doing it.
  And now, the IRS wants to be our best friend...
  When I taught for the Bartonian Metaphysical Society and the Institute
of Applied Metaphysics, an agency of the Canadian government that was
involved in PSI research at a university in Toronto used to plant
'spotters' in the classes, to target potential experimentation and
research subjects. According to one of the spotters who had difficulty
holding his liquor and his tongue at the same time, our Saskatoon group
was considered 'untouchable' as a result of a visit by 'friends' of the
organization that was funding their research.
  The evening after I read Robert Munroe's 'Journeys Out Of The Body,' I
astral travelled. After reading a book on Lucid Dreaming, I did lucid
dreaming. Upon reading Carlos Castenada's various works, I entered into
many of the same experiences he wrote about. When my mother's persona/
soul went AWOL during her bout with cancer, I bought a book on Shamanism
that told how to travel into the Underworld and retrieve a person's 'animal/animus' and place it back in their body, and I did so.
   This is my life...it is not a matter for belief/disbelief or debate.
  To me, my life and my capabilities are simply the way it is, and I don't
consider them particularly extraordinary. To me, what is extraordinary is
the fact that pedal-steel players can actually make wonderful music with
those instruments. I tried like hell, and all I could make was noise.
  My only real purpose in telling you all of this is to impress upon you
the fact that there is much more going on in the background of government,
life, society, science, etc., than what is readily apparent, not only to
the general public, but even to those who research secret government
activity and projects from the outside, as well as many who work on them
from the inside.
  Anyone the least bit familiar with the world of secret intelligence is
aware that it is composed of concentric circles-within-circles, with each
layer remaining mostly a mystery to the layers external to it.   The CIA's involvement in mind-control research was merely the second
inner layer, with the public/private research community being the outer
layer. As mind-boggling and incredulous as the details of the CIA's
involvement may seem, they are merely grunt-workers for inner layers of
agencies and organizations who expand and develop the techniques and
information that filters down into practical applications on both a
macrocosmic and microcosmic level.
  To believe that the most essential research and development in military
intelligence is being done by people that you can call or visit at the
local CIA office is naieve, at best.
  The CIA, according to my understanding of the military personnel who
were involved with the Saskatchewan Cabal of mind-research, are little
more than heavy-handed amateurs whose chief asset is their willingness
to get involved in projects which have the potential of blowing up in
their faces and requiring complex damage control.
  It is my impression that the psychiatric butchery epitomized by Canada's
Dr. Ewen Cameron is typical of operations that are delegated to the CIA,
since the military prefers to experiment on their own personell and
subjects with methods that are unlikely to destroy their minds, to no
apparent purpose.
  Although the mind-wiping electroshock techniques used by Dr. Cameron
were apparently used in my 'treatment,' it is my recollection that, rather
than being wheeled into a room with some amateurish, inane, tape-loop
used to 'reconstruct' my mind, there were a variety of psychological and
medical professionals who spent a great deal of time involved in activity
designed to restore/restructure what had previously existed, as well as
creating a variety of new mental paridigms which were designed to be able
to function in a fashion similar to the interlinkable modular structure
of the C-Programming Language.
  To tell the truth, although the research and experimentation that I was
subjected to was undoubtedly invasive and unethical, I could see it as
being beneficial to the evolutionary human equation if it was done in an
above-board manner, as opposed to being hidden in the private enclave of
secret agencies, to be used with the goal of outside control of the
minds and behavior of others, without their consent.
  Mind-control, as described in terms of the MKULTRA ET AL Projects, is
actually only a single arm of secret-government efforts to monitor and control the citizenry.
  The ultimate goal of the research and experiments in this arena of
human evolution is the combination of an interdisciplinary combination
of methods, processes and techniques which will enable a globalization
of control over humanity--affectionately known by wild-eyed conspiracy
theorists as the New World Order.
  If I can restrain myself, for a few hours, from breaking into screaming
fits of rage calling for the public execution of all members of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, forthwith, I might just share with you some of
the things that one learns when they read the file which was accidentally
attached to an email from Kent Crispin, which contains a download of the
complete hard drive of the top secret military facility at which he works.

IMPORTANT NEWS FLASH!!!
I HAVE JUST LEARNED, FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE, THAT SECRET GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE FORBIDDEN TO / ILLEGAL FOR
THE AVERAGE CITIZEN TO ENGAGE IN!
  OK, so it doesn't come as a major surprise to anyone.
  Nevertheless, our world-view tends to be limited to, and shaped by, the
information that we are 'allowed' to access. Even if we are aware of the
fact that the government is undoubtedly going full-steam ahead in areas
such as cloning research and merger of artificial intelligence with
artificial life forms, we don't give much thought to the implications
and possible consequences of exotic, secret research and experimentation,
because we don't have enough information about what is going on behind
closed government doors to make any judgements.
  The information that we *do* get about out-of-control government actions
and policies invariably comes after-the-fact, or at a time that we are
*told* is after-the-fact. ("We stopped doing that years ago. Joe doesn't work here, anymore. We
got rid of the bad apples, and now it's just us GoodGuys left...")
  A friend of mine did computer work for an Arizona neurologist who put
electrodes and steel plates in the skulls of monkeys, rabbits, etc., in
order to do brain-mapping (one of the major areas of mind-control research), in order to study Parkinson's Disease.
  The neurologist was approached by a research foundation that was very
interested in giving him a grant to work with children, instead of with
animals. This has become an acceptable area of experimentation (a quick
study of those involved easily links them to a variety of intelligence
agencies). Their offer was refused as a result of the format and structure
of the proposal obviously being geared more toward providing information
and results that had more to do with learning methods to control aberrant
behavior than with benefitting the proposed child subjects.
  After his refusal, his current grant was canceled, and he was again
made the offer, which he accepted.
  Dr. Ewen Cameron, the Canadian MKULTRA mind-butcherer, was instrumental
in helping the CIA to see the benefit of taking an 'interdisciplinary'
approach to mind-control.
  Although Dr. Cameron's basic method was to combine a wide variety of medical, biological, psychiatric, anthropological, et al, methods using
his own limited knowledge, in your basic VoodooLeeches methodology, the
CIA and military intelligence agencies began consolidating the various
arenas of mind/human-conditioning research and experimentation by helping
to sychronize the research of a wide body of educational and research
professionals in divergent fields of expertise.
  As a result of directing the focus and evolution of the majority of
scientific and psychological research in North America through control
of the funding mechanisms and access to research publishing, the American
intelligence community has managed to merge the research community into
an integrated tool for delivering the information and results desired
by the Controllers for their own grand designs.
  John Lily, a respected cutting-edge researcher told the intelligence
community to "Fuck off!" when they approached him with an offer to fund
his research on the condition that it become secret/classified.
  Lily suddenly found most doors in the scientific community being slammed
in his face, not able to even getting a job sweeping-up after conferences
that he previously had been begged to attend. (In essence, he quickly
found that he couldn't even get elected ScientificDogCatcher.)
  Not to worry, there were researchers standing in line to take Lily's
pioneering mind-mapping research to new heights, using experimentation
techniques on human subjects that Lily had too much compassion and integrity to use on dolphins.
  The "Dont ask...don't tell..." military policy on homosexuality in the
armed services has long been an unspoken understanding in the research
community, where the players long ago learned that making an issue of
the ethics of the researchers down the hall throwing niggers off the
roof, to see it they really do have thick skulls, could have negative
reprecussions on their own position and funding.
  Many researchers find themselves doing what they consider to be needed
and pertinent research in their projects on their own time, after they
have satisfied the wants and needs of those funding their project.
  Of course, if you ask most researchers about the veracity of what I
have just claimed, you will meet with sincere denials, and perhaps even
genuine laughter. However, a relative of mine who is engaged in providing
seminars on effective philanthropic fund-raising makes no bones about the
fact that the success of his seminars revolves around teaching people to
sell their souls while remaining blissfully ignorant of the fact that
they are doing so.
("If murdering a thousand children in my research saves the life of a
 single child...")
  While I am not in any way suggesting that the majority of researchers
are NaziMonsters, having allowed themselves to be maneuvered into a
position where their research is driven by the goals of those funding it,
their research in 'turning on the gas' is irrevocably linked to research
by loosely connected entities who are being funded to research 'putting
them in the ovens.'
  Intelligence agencies' interdisciplinary approach to developing the
ability to monitor and control the minds, beliefs, attitudes, actions
and behavior of the citizenry (in the interests of National Security,
of course), has resulted in what has been openly known by many as the
New Manhattan Project. Just as the Nuclear/Atomic Manhattan Project
was an all-out, top priority effort engaging the premiere players in
a variety of scientific fields, the New Manhattan Project involves a
consolidation of research and activity spanning such diverse arenas
as mind-control, emotional-manipulation, behavioral conditioning,
citizen surveillance-monitoring-classification, and even encryption.
  The research and experiments in Artificial Intelligence and Human
Intelligence are intricately linked.
  Neural Network models and implementations are based on understanding
and imitating human "operant conditioning, the form of learning in which
animals and humans learn the effects of their actions," as Professor
Stephen Grossberg states.
  The Artificial Intelligence approach of Neural Networks is based on
the processing of symbolic information, as opposed to numerical data.
The Controllers have mastered the art of 1984'ish manipulation of the
public mind through media control and spin doctoring, now able to gather the citizens into an angry torch-carrying mob, chasing the U.S.ConstitutionMonster back to the castle to defend themselves against
the NewImprovedFourHorsemenOfTheApocalypse. (Any Congressman who is
caught dorking a teenage girl and cheating on his taxes has a fighting
chance of surviving if he can convince the electorate he is 'tough on
crime,' or whatever the current TenSecondSoundByteFadOfTheDay is.)
  The Controllers efforts to control access to information are centered
around their need to control the EmotionalSymbolism by which they have
learned to lead the public around by our noses.
  The grand Artificial Intelligence push to "develop principled theories
of brain and behavior and incorporating them into machines," as Brian
Fitzgerald writes in 'Bravo New World,' is really part-and-parcel of the
Controllers' designs to guide the future development of the InterNet into
a WorldWideStickyWeb wherein the Medium is capable of manipulating the user into the position of controlled stooge, rather than a participant,
by being able to monitor, log and analyze the user's basic operant
conditioning, via his or her responses, thus being able to provide the
user with only those options which will lead them in the direction that
is desired by the Controllers.
(An example is the feature of allowing the user to 'customize' the
 interfaces they are interacting through, according to their personal
 interests, with the AutoBot then serving up generous helpings of pointers
 and information beneficial to the provider, instead of a genuine cross-
 section of what is actually available on the InterNet.)

  The federal government proclaimed the 1990's the Decade of the Brain.
What they neglected to mention is that Military Intelligence has been
put in charge of monitoring, analyzing and shaping the Brain...
  CNS (Cognitive Neural Systems) research and development has become a
wholly owned subsiduary of the Air Force super laboratories, the Office
of Naval Research, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency),
the National Science Foundation, and the rest of the Usual Suspects.
  ou remember DARPA, don't you--those wonderful folks who gave us the
InterNet which routes all communications through military channels?
  ou remember the Office of Naval Research, don't you--those wonderful
folks who developed products and techniques for monitoring all of the
communications on the face of the earth?
  Fitzgerald notes, in 'Bostonia,' that "Graduates of CNS work in a plethora of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, telecommun-
ications, software engineering, economics, finance...medicine...and,
of course, robotics.
  Strip away the thin veneer of reliance on the research being conducted
by RespectableInstitutions and what you have is MKULTRA cross-breeding
with Artificial Intelligence to produce a DemonChild whose NeuralNetworks
are a fusion of GrayMatter and a DigitalThisIsWhereouAreGoingToGoToday
  Julia Schickedanz, an MIT professor, remarks on the fact that the
professors involved in CNS research and development "specialize in
seemingly unrelated areas of research."
  Right...and the New World Order will result in the globalization of
"seemingly unrelated areas" of the world...
  Grossberg, speaking of the 'interdisciplinary' approach to the study
and implementation of Artificial Intelligence, says, "such an approach
is absolutely necessary to theoretically investigate fundamental issues
of mind and brain processes."
  I am certain that it is just a 'coincidence'   that
two champions of the 'interdisciplinary' approach to research in the
understanding of how the mind works and how it can be manipulated, Dr.
Ewen Cameron, Canadian mind-butcherer, and Professor Grossberg CyBorg
Creator, are each a Rockerfeller GoldenChild.
  Grossberg apparently spent decades and millions of dollars discovering
what he could have learned by forking over a sawbuck for a book by the
GrandaddyOfInterActiveMediaUnderstanding, Marshal McCluhan, 'The Medium
Is The Message,' as he informs us, belatedly, "What we perceive depends on how the nervous system processes messages."
  And those wonderful folks who provided us with an interactive medium
which they are capable of monitoring and controlling, are now involved
in a priority funding of research which will enable the medium to be
able to process/provide messages which are intricately linked with the
structure and functioning of our own nervous system.
  More importantly, the ability of the computer to monitor our habits and
the most infinitesimal details of our personal lives, when combined with
a neural network capable of learning and adapting to our thoughts, our
desires and our habits, essentially has the capacity to transform itself
into a Mythological Siren of the Deep, luring us to our destruction,
regardless of whether or not we know it to be an Illusion.
(If you think I am overstating my case, here, remind yourself how easy
 it is for Charlie CorporateMonger to get JoeSixPack to provide every
 detail of his life in order to get a SuperMarketValueCard that gets
 him a nickle off on a can of beans. If they had a record of your visits
 to and file accesses on the BigBreastedBlonde Web Site, they would have
 a Swedish Masseuse bring you the card to fill out, and end up with your]
 wallet, your car and your house, as well, and you'd be eating your beans
 out behind the dumpster.)
  In essence, Artificial Intelligence researchers are attempting to find
ways to incorporate the ability to understand and incorporate human behavior and response mechanisms into programmed machines/environments,
thus rendering them capable of fulfilling functions which humans normally
require decades of experience and application to acquire competence in.
  During my last entry into the U.S. through the Vancouver Customs port,
my sister was horrified to learn that the devices in each lane were visually and auditorily monitoring those who passed through. License
plates are auto-scanned and run through the computer to flag people of
interest to Border Authorities (and I suspect that visual recognition
technology of humans is also being used/tested).
  The vehicle in front of us contained your typical middle-class American
family, and was passed through with only perfunctory attention being
given to them, yet the Customs Officer thumped on the top and side of
their car before waving them to proceed, as if checking to make sure that
they didn't have a few hundred kilos of heroin stashed away.
  My sister was puzzled as to why he did that, whereupon I explained that
he was not interested in *their* reaction, but in *mine*, since I was next
in line, the computer had flagged me, and someone inside was undoubtedly
listening to see if I told her, "Are you sure you hid the dope?"
  Some of the Artificial Intelligence AutoBots of the future will no
doubt be MultiMedia HumanResponse LieDetectors.
  Rather than measuring your pulse, breathing rate and electrical
tension, they will measure variations in your Personally Categorized
Basic Neural Network Profile.
  Just as gun ownership can be denied today on the basis of a history
of mental problems or criminal activity, certain activities, rights,
or access to information, in the future, will be based on your meeting
guidelines/profiles as judged by your interactions with AutoBots that
are designed to analyze and categorize your mind and behavior.
  Grossberg maintains, "All conscious states are resonant states. And resonance can join cognition to emotion in a unified conscious experience."   The implication of this is that the Artificial Intelligence that is
being developed to work in parallel with the human brain and the elements
of human behavior will be capable of becoming a 'partner' in our thoughts,
emotions, and consciousness, and thus be an integral part of that which
influences the direction and processes of our mind, psyche and behavior.
  Take a moment to think about the full import of the technology which
will shape our future being shaped and directed almost wholly by Military
Intelligence agencies and their associates.
  Advertising psychology and MKULTRA mind-control research are barely
poor-cousins to the Cognitive Neural Systems technology that is being
prepared to not only monitor, analyze and categorize even the most
minute areas of our mind, emotions, psyche and behavioral patterns,
but also to have the capacity to adapt *their* behavior to our own
personal psychological structure and, as in the case of Thing1 and
Thing2, "predict" our "impending impacts" with the desires of the
Controllers, and direct us toward "avoidance behaviors" which will
"suppress movements that will cause collisions" with the goals and
designs of the Controllers.
  It can't be long before the Trilateral Commission is replaced by
the Trilateral CPU...

Where Do THE (TM) Want our Mind To Go Today? - SAHMD!!!
"ou're not really an anarchist if you don't have your Anarchist Union
 dues paid up-to-date."
~Anna R. Christ, U.S. Government Department of Anarchy Czar
  Even those who dismiss, as ridiculous, the conspiracist theory that the
entire world is controlled by a small, Secret Cabal of individuals, with
me at its head, recognize that over the course of history, the media
began encroaching on the traditional role of religion and community as
the source of beliefs about the world around them, as well as increasingly
influencing opinions and attitudes, and that the news media was originally
controlled by a very small enclave of individuals with powerful financial
and political connections.
  Thus, the front-page newspaper story about the completion of this or
that railway was more likely to be accompanied by a picture of a Railway
Czar chomping on a fat cigar as he drove the last spike, rather than a
picture of 30,000 Dead Chincs, since the LittleellerFellers didn't get
a lot of dinner invitations to the publisher's estate.
  Far from being a Secret Conspiracy, the control of the newpaper media
by a few individuals was a well-established Open Conspiracy, regarded
as SimplyTheWayThingsAre in an era when the money, power and connections of the OldBoyNetwork trumped poverty, insignificance and a cousin named
Louie who could get you a good deal on a pair of used shoes.
  Regardless of the fact that the public knew that the news was a fixed
game, even if there was a 'competing' newsrag from a different member
of the RichAndPowerfulOldBoysNetwork, it was the only game in town, and
those in control of the news that got reported were the ones who named
the game and framed whatever debate took place.
  The newspaper publishers of yesteryear were, like todays car salesmen,
masters of manipulating their customers into choosing between the 'models'
of news/opinion/reality that *they* were offering. Even today, for all
of the lip-service paid to 'competition' in the mainstream media, I doubt
that there was a single person in America who bought copies of *all* the
major mainstream newspapers in order to find the one with the headline,
"Freedom Fighter Timothy McVeigh Takes A Bite Out Of Government Crime."
  In 1937, by which time  America had more radios than indoor toilets, the Rockerfeller Foundation started funding early mind-control research
into the social effects of new forms of mass media, such as radio, and
their potential for effecting social control of the masses.
  The main headquarters for the research, which was carried out by several universities, was at the Office of Radio Research, at Princeton.
It was headed by Paul Lazersfeld, an influential figure in a Marxist
ThinkTank, the Institute for Social Research (I.S.R.), commonly known
as the Frankfurt School.
  Interestingly, the goals of the Bolshevik Intelligentsi of I.S.R.--to
undermine the Judeo-Christian legacy of Western Civilization through an
"abolution of culture," and to determine new cultural forms which would
increase the alienization of the population--were very similar in concept
to the techniques that Canadian mind-butcherer, Dr. Ewen Cameron, would
pioneer decades later in the field of psychiatry--creating 'Differential
Amnesia' through electroshock mind-wiping, and recreating persona/
personality through the use of 'Psychic Driving'--with the main difference
seeming to be that the Radio Project's Lazersfeld didn't have access to
the technology to pump thousands of volts through the brains of the masses, so had to settle for giving them extended treatments with low-
power radio waves, as well as using repetitive formatting instead of
Dr. Cameron's "I am a good person who is going to assassinate the Prime
Minister" tape-loops.
  At the time, Communism was Semi-Fashionable, not yet having been magically transformed, overnight, into the GreatEvil, and among the
entities taking an interest in using the Comintern created thinktank
to learn how to use Bolshevik techniques to put the masses in their
back pocket were, besides the Rockerfeller Foundation, the Columbian
Broadcasting System, several American intelligence services, and the International Labour Organization.
  As Michael J. Minnicino notes, in 'The New Dark Age,' "Despite the official gloss, the activities of the Radio Project make it clear that
its purpose was to test empirically the (I.S.P.) Adorno-Benjamin thesis
that the net effect of the mass media could be to atomize and increase
lability--what people would later call "brainwashing."
[EditWhore's Note: If you are incapable of making the connection between
TV/Advertising and Hypnosis, because the programs and ads don't begin with, "ou are growing veerrryyy sleepy," or between TV/Advertising and
Brainwashing, because a BigRat doesn't jump out of the TV and eat your
face, then just try to equate TV/Advertising with your mother's attempts
to convince you that broccoli tastes good, or the teacher who tried to
trick you into thinking that Math was more fun than looking out the
window and watching the dogs fucking in the schoolyard.]
  Frank Stanton, an industrial psychology Ph.D., later to become the
President of the CBS News Division, President of CBS, and Chairman of
the Board of the RAND Corporation, was the Radio Project's research
  Herta Herzog would later use the propaganda skills she developed as
a Radio Project researcher to become the first director of research
for Voice of America.
  The course of the whole developing radio industry would shortly be
affected in a major way by the Rockerfeller/Intelligence/Broadcaster's
Radio Project research into the use of the radio medium as a tool for
Social/Mind Control.
  In a 1939 Journal of Applied Psychology quarterly edition, the Radio
Project published their conclusion that Americans had become "radio
minded" (think about that phrase...), and that "their listening had
become so fragmented that repetition of format was the key to popularity,"
as Minnicino points out. "The play list determined the 'hits'...and repetition could make any form of music or any performer...a 'star.'"
("ou got your dead skunk in the middle of the road, dead skunk in the
 middle of the road...")
ou Want Regular Vanilla, Or Vanilla Regular?

"Not only are hit songs, stars, and soap operas cyclically recurrent and rigidly invariable types, but the specific content of the entertainment
itself is derived from them and only appears to change. The details are
~Theodor Adorno, Chief of the Radio Project's Music Section, and an
 instrumental, decades-long member of the Communist Institute For Social
 Research, to which we owe a debt of gratitude for ensuring that audio
 pictures of Chairman Rockerfeller would dominate our audio landscape,
 and that quotations from the BigBankBook of Chairman Rockerfeller would
 fall on our ears, day and night.
[EditWhore's Note: Today, of course, Corporations are getting in on
 the act by turning arts and sports events into an advertising medium
 in their own right (e.g. The Nike Bolshoi Ballet Company, and the
 Ravage Realty Desert Golf Classic), not to mention Chairman Pepsi
 purchasing the rights to the high-school Proletariat from their  bourgeois SchoolMasters.]
Shut The Fuck Up And Give Me our Gut-Feeling About This Program:
  Next time that you're having a highly-intellectual discussion (drinking
cafe-latte with your little pinkie raised), about the philosophical and
conceptual themes of a given program, think about "Little Annie" aka
the Stanton-Lazersfeld Pogrom ( <--meaninful typo ) Analyzer.
  It was designed to allow test-audience members to register the intensity
of their likes-dislikes on a moment-to-moment basis during a program. This
allowed the operators to determine which situations or characters produced
a momentary, positive feeling state.
  Michael Minnicino notes that "Little Annie transformed radio, film,
and ultimately television programming." He adds that Little Annie, in
updated formats, is still what drives mainstream programming today.
[Note From T. Arthur: Basically, Little Annie is the human equivalent
 of the Pavlovian drool-cup, measuring the flow of body juices when
 the DoggieFoodLight goes on, or you watch an ad for edible panties.  The VoicesInsideMyHead that claim, "Everything since the BigBang has  been plagarism," when translated from Analog Wave to Digital Format,  say, "The only movie/program that really exists is 'The ogi Berra  Story'...everything else is DejaVuReRunsAllOverAgain.]
Our Story So Far:
  OK, so we got your small Non-Secret Cabal of NewsRag Czars going about
their business of exercising their InGodWeTrust-Given Right to decide what people with less money should know and think.   And then we got your Radio Media Medium starting to cut-in on the NewsRag Czar's RealityCreationRacket, as a result of there being more of them than indoor toilets, so as how people now get their RealityInput
even when they ain't on the Crapper, making room for what they is reading
by engaging in ExcessRealityOutput (A RetroTech version of GarbageIn-
GarbageOut), and then wiping their OutputDevice with their InputDevice.
  And then we got your basic RichGuyFoundation using TaxDeductibleDollars
to hire your basic GodLessCommies to figure out how the RichGuys can use the rEvolutionary New Commi-Tel Bolshevik Marketing System to get the
Radio Proletariat to pony-up $ 19.95 (plus shipping and handling) for
the SilverPlatter upon which their "new cultural forms" (Translation:
ConsumerIsm) will be handed to them, making the RichGuy even richer (by using TaxDeductibleDollars, nonetheless--pretty tricky, eh?).
  And we got your WhiteReds telling us that if they play a CountryBlues song as many times as there is pictures of Stalin in Moscow, then, not
only can they make some Drifter a star, but they can measure how many
times JoeSixPack's blood rushes to his brain or his penis while he's
thinking about how *his* baby done left him, too, and that if more blood
is rushing back and forth when Luke the Drifter is singing the words 'baby' and 'yeah,' then they can take a song called, "Baby, Baby, eah-
eah, eah, eah, Baby eah-eah," and get Joe SixPack's blood flowing
in and out of his penis so fast that he'll need a Pavlovian Drool-Cup
underneath his Pecker, and that they can have the song performed by some
oungStud who they put on TV and have him wiggle his pelvis around like
some BigDickedDarkie, and get the blood flowing back and forth in the
women's private parts too, which would *really* result in "new cultural
forms which would increase the alienation of the populace," because Daddy
don't want his LittlePrincess (TM) getting her LittleNastyParts (TM) all juiced up by some WhiteNiggerLoverBoy.
  Oh...except I guess I haven't mentioned the part about TeleVision, yet.
  Anyway, you got to remember that the reason that your RunOfTheMillBasic
GodLessCommie is Godless, is that if you're going to start a rEvolution,
then you can't have your Proletariat all junked-out on Religion, or they
are going to be too laid-back to help you torch the Palace. So you have
to create your basic NewBarbarism, getting rid of anything that smacks
of Universal Truth or Natural Law, and get people to trade in their old
PopeMobile for a SnowmobileRacingAcrossTheTundra, with a BigTittedNun
stroking Nietzsche's IceWeasle in glossy-color ads telling the Prolotariat
that there's no need to stick to the straight-and-narrow path when you've got an off-road philosophical vehicle that can go BeyondGoodAndEvil in sex-seconds flat.
  This appeals to a lot of people who never had seconds on sex because
they could only fuck once in the backseat of their PopeMobile, since it
was supposed to be for making babies, and not for having fun, but they
can play HideTheSalami as many times as they want on the seat of a
snowmobile, with God-and-everybody watching (only there is not really
any God).
  What is important to realize is that one of the main Keys to making the
BullShitVic's Schtick work, has to do with shit-canning the creative act
and making creativity historically-specific.
[Author's Note: Although this is important, I don't really know exactly
 how to explain why it is so, since I don't really understand it and I
 am, in large part, merely plagarizing excerpts from 'The New Dark Age'
 by Michael J. Minnicino, on this point.
 I think Tim C. May and some of the other CypherPunks understand this
 crap, though, so maybe you could ask them about it...]
  But I *do* understand *why* it is important to Marxist rEvolutionaries
to burn up and toss out all of the old writings and art, and stuff, in
order to take control of the hearts and minds of the Proletariat, since
it is like moving in with a NewOldLady, and she's got pictures of her
old boyfriend around, and loveletters and stuff, and you don't want her
thinking about him while you're sticking your dick in her.
  So, anyway...
  It's not like Rockerfeller ain't 'getting any,' since he's already a
part of the OldBoyNetwork that's GangBangingReality with their OfficalNews
stealing your chicks, so you're going to join up with his gang, too, and you figure it won't hurt to try and pick up a few new pointers on putting your MeatInMotion from Stalin's BumBuddies, since Stalin is, like, the JohnnyWadd of Social Control.
  So Stalin's BumBuddies tell you that first, you got to get Prolotariat
Chicks a little tipsy and disoriented by culturing them with a little bit
of Absolut, you set some new cultural forms (make their nipples hard) by
sweet-talking them a bit, and then create a NewBarbarism by talking nasty
to them.   Of course, once you have the attention of their orfice, then you keep driving home your point, repeatedly, and if you can find the spots on
their body that make them feel good or bad, and give them the proper
combination of each, then you can whisper 'give me all your money' in
their ear while they are in the throes of passion, and they will hardly
notice, but they will *do* it.
{Excuse me, but I've got to go have a smoke...be right back...}
  In reality, as the GodLessCommies from the Institute for Social Research
undoubtedly explained to Rocky, after he had a shower, was that the same
basic rules applied, whether you were using your real name or using an
alias, such as Reverend Sun Moon, Jim Baker, Jim Jones, Dr. Cameron, or Richard Helms.
  As a matter of fact, one of the main reasons for the intensity of the
Rockerfeller Foundation's interest in the use of Radio for Social/Mind
Control was that one of Rocky's financial and political associates,
Adolf Hitler, had begun 'stealing the show,' so to speak, with the
vivacity of his powerful presence in the medium.
  Another factor in the Rockerfeller Foundations quest to learn the
secret of using Radio as a tool of social and mind control was the
emergence of Radio's younger cousin, Television, which showed promise
of being able to surpass Radio's ClitLicking talents, and go straight
for the G-spot.
  Theodor Adorno wrote, in regard to TeleVision, in 1944, "Its consequences will be quite  enormous and promise to intensify the impoverishment of aesthetic matter so drastically that by tomorrow the thinly veiled identity of all industrial culture products can come triumphantly out in the open, derisively fulfilling the Wagnerian dream of the Gesamtkunstwerk--the fusion of all the arts into one work."
(The New World ArtEr)
  In other words, TeleVision was seen by the I.S.P, the Rockerfellers,
Military Intelligence Agencies, et al, FROM ITS VER INCEPTION, as a
useful tool in using intellectually lame, but emotionally significant
content, as an instrument of social control which could be used to
significantly influence the minds/thought/beliefs/opinions of the public. (In other words, TV wasn't born 'retarded' by 'accident.')
  So, whether or not one believes in a single individual, or group of
individuals, who is secretly running the world and controlling the whole
of our reality, it seems that there are certainly a number of people who
are *trying* to do so.
  The techniques of mind-control are nothing new--they are centuries old
and are only being 'refined' in our time, through research and experiment-
ation, to be applical over a wider range of geography than simply the local village, and over a greater spectrum of ethnicity than the members
of closely related tribes.
  The future of TeleVision was set a half-century ago by people of wealth
and power who had gone to great pains to research the best way to develop
the electronic media as a tool of social control via mind control. Even
the most cursory of checks indicates that members of Military Intelligence
agencies were as 'thick as thieves' in the creation and management of
the Television Industry.
  These people have had over a half-century to develop and refine their
control of and use of electronic media to meet their own ends.
  Wouldn't it be terrifying if they had not only developed the means to
put their witting and unwitting shills *anywhere* they wanted in our
societies, corporations, governments and educational institutions, but
also had a means to use their shills in every area of our life, in order
to influence what we see, think and the way in which we perceive our

Breakthrough Texts    Leaderless Resistance
   An Essay by Louis Beam
     "Leaderless Resistance" -- Part One
     [IMAGE] The concept of leaderless resistance was proposed by Col.
     Ulius Louis Amoss, who was the founder of International Service of
     Information Incorporated, located in Baltimore, Maryland. Col. Amoss
     died more than 15 years ago, but during his life he was a tireless
     opponent of Communism, as well as a skilled intelligence officer.
     [INLINE] Col. Amoss first wrote of leaderless resistance on April
     17, 1962. His theories of organization were primarily directed
     against the threat of eventual Communist takeover in the United
     States. The present writer, with the benefit of having lived many
     years beyond Col. Amoss, has taken his theories and expounded on
     them.
     [INLINE] Col. Amoss feared the Communists. This author fears the
     federal government. Communism now represents a threat to no one in
     the United States, while federal tyranny represents a threat to
     EVERYONE. The writer has joyfully lived long enough to see the dying
     breaths of Communism, but may unhappily remain long enough to see
     the last dying gasps of freedom in America.
     [INLINE] In the hope that, somehow, America can still produce the
     brave sons and daughters necessary to fight off ever-increasing
     persecution and oppression, this essay is offered. Frankly, it is
     too close to call at this point. Those who love liberty, and believe
     in freedom enough to fight for it, are rare today; but within the
     bosom of every once great nation, there remains secreted the pearls
     of former greatness.
     [INLINE] They are there. I have looked into their sparkling eyes;
     sharing a brief moment in time with them as I passed through this
     life. Relished their friendship, endured their pain, and they mine.
     We are a band of brothers native to the soil, gaining strength one
     from another as we have rushed headlong into battle that all the
     weaker, timid men say we can not win. Perhaps not... but then again,
     perhaps we can. It's not over till the last freedom fighter is
     buried or imprisoned, or the same happens to those who would destroy
     their liberty.
     [INLINE] Barring any cataclysmic events, the struggle will yet go on
     for years. The passage of time will make it clear to even the more
     slow among us that the government is the foremost threat to the life
     and liberty of the folk. The government will no doubt make today's
     oppressiveness look like grade school work compared to what they
     have planned in the future. Meanwhile, there are those of us who
     continue to hope that somehow the few can do what the many have not.
     [INLINE] We are cognizant that before things get better they will
     certainly get worse as government shows a willingness to use ever
     more severe police state measures against dissidents. This changing
     situation makes it clear that those who oppose state repression must
     be prepared to alter, adapt, and modify their behavior, strategy,
     and tactics as circumstances warrant. Failure to consider new
     methods and implement them as necessary will make the government's
     efforts at suppression uncomplicated. It is the duty of every
     patriot to make the tyrant's life miserable. When one fails to do so
     he not only fails himself, but his people.
     [INLINE] With this in mind, current methods of resistance to tyranny
     employed by those who love our race, culture, and heritage must pass
     a litmus test of soundness. Methods must be objectively measured as
     to their effectiveness, as well as to whether they make the
     government's intention of repression more possible or more
     difficult. Those not working to aid our objectives must be
     discarded, or the government benefits from our failure to do so.
     [INLINE] As honest men who have banded together into groups or
     associations of a political or religious nature are falsely labeled
     "domestic terrorists" or "cultists" and suppressed, it will become
     necessary to consider other methods of organization, or as the case
     may very well call for: non- organization.
     [INLINE] One should keep in mind that it is not in the government's
     interest to eliminate all groups. Some few must remain in order to
     perpetuate the smoke and mirrors for the masses that America is a
     "free democratic country" where dissent is allowed. Most
     organizations, however, that possess the potential for effective
     resistance will not be allowed to continue. Anyone who is so naive
     as to believe the most powerful government on earth will not crush
     any who pose a real threat to that power, should not be active, but
     rather at home studying political history.
     [INLINE] The question as to who is to be left alone and who is not,
     will be answered by how groups and individuals deal with several
     factors such as: avoidance of conspiracy plots, rejection of
     feebleminded malcontents, insistence upon quality of the
     participants, avoidance of all contact with the front men for the
     federals - the news media - and, finally, camouflage (which can be
     defined as the ability to blend in the public's eye the more
     committed groups of resistance with mainstream "kosher" associations
     that are generally seen as harmless).
     [INLINE] Primarily though, whether any organization is allowed to
     continue in the future will be a matter of how big a threat a group
     represents. Not a threat in terms of armed might or political
     ability, for there is none of either for the present, but rather,
     threat in terms of potentiality. It is potential the federals fear
     most. Whether that potential exists in an individual or group is
     incidental. The federals measure potential threat in terms of what
     might happen given a situation conducive to action on the part of a
     resistive organization or individual. Accurate intelligence
     gathering allows them to assess the potential. Showing one's hand
     before the bets are made is a sure way to lose.
     [INLINE] The movement for freedom is rapidly approaching the point
     where, for many people, the option of belonging to a group will be
     non-existent. For others, group membership will be a viable option
     for only the immediate future. Eventually, and perhaps much sooner
     than most believe possible, the price paid for membership will
     exceed any perceived benefit. But for now, some of the groups that
     do exist often serve a useful purpose either for the newcomer who
     can be indoctrinated into the ideology of the struggle, or for
     generating positive propaganda to reach potential freedom fighters.
     It is sure that, for the most part, this struggle is rapidly
     becoming a matter of individual action, each of its participants
     making a private decision in the quietness of his heart to resist:
     to resist by any means necessary.
     [INLINE] It is hard to know what others will do, for no man truly
     knows another man's heart. It is enough to know what one himself
     will do. A great teacher once said "know thyself." Few men really
     do, but let each of us promise ourselves not to go quietly to the
     fate our would-be masters have planned.
     [INLINE] The concept of leaderless resistance is nothing less than a
     fundamental departure in theories of organization. The orthodox
     scheme of organization is diagrammatically represented by the
     pyramid, with the mass at the bottom and the leader at the top. This
     fundamental of organization is to be seen not only in armies, which
     are, of course, the best illustration of the pyramid structure, with
     the mass of soldiery (the privates) at the bottom responsible to
     corporals; who are in turn responsible to sergeants, and so on up
     the entire chain of command to the generals at the top. But the same
     structure is seen in corporations, ladies' garden clubs, and in our
     political system itself. This orthodox "pyramid" scheme of
     organization is to be seen basically in all existing political,
     social, and religious structures in the world today, from the
     Federal government to the Roman Catholic Church.
     [INLINE] The Constitution of the United States, in the wisdom of the
     Founders, tried to sublimate the essential dictatorial nature
     pyramidal organization by dividing authority into three: executive,
     legislative, and judicial. But the pyramid remains essentially
     untouched.
     [INLINE] This scheme of organization, the pyramid, is not only
     useless, but extremely dangerous for the participants when it is
     utilized in a resistance movement against state tyranny. Especially
     is this so in technologically advanced societies where electronic
     surveillance can often penetrate the structure, thus revealing its
     chain of command. Experience has revealed over and over again that
     anti-state political organizations utilizing this method of command
     and control are easy prey for government infiltration, entrapment,
     and destruction of the personnel involved. This has been seen
     repeatedly in the United States where pro-government infiltrators or
     agent provocateurs weasel their way into patriotic groups and
     destroy them from within.
     [INLINE] In the pyramid form of organization, an infiltrator can
     destroy anything which is beneath his level of infiltration, and
     often those above him as well. If the traitor has infiltrated at the
     top, then the entire organization from the top down is compromised
     and may be traduced at will.
     "Leaderless Resistance" -- Part Two
     [IMAGE] A recent example of the cell system taken from the left wing
     of politics are the Communists. The Communists, in order to get
     around the obvious problems involved in pyramidal organization,
     developed to an art the cell system. They had numerous independent
     cells which operated completely isolated from one another and
     particularly with no knowledge of each other, but were orchestrated
     together by a central headquarters. For instance, during WWII, in
     Washington, it is known that there were at least six secret
     Communist cells operating at high levels in the United States
     government (plus all the open Communists who were protected and
     promoted by President Roosevelt), however, only one of the cells was
     rooted out and destroyed. How many more actually were operating, no
     one can say for sure.
     [INLINE] The Communist cells which operated in the U.S. until late
     1991 under Soviet control could have at their command a leader who
     held a social position which appeared to be very lowly. He could be,
     for example, a busboy in a restaurant, but in reality a colonel or a
     general in the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB. Under him could be a
     number of cells, and a person active in one cell would almost never
     have knowledge of individuals who were active in other cells; in
     fact, the members of the other cells would be supporting that cell
     which was under attack and ordinarily would lend very strong support
     to it in many ways. This is at least part of the reason, no doubt,
     that whenever in the past Communists were attacked in this country,
     support for them sprang up in many unexpected places.
     [INLINE] The effective and efficient operation of a cell system
     after the Communist model is, of course, dependent upon central
     direction, which means impressive organization, funding from the
     top, and outside support, all of which the Communists had.
     Obviously, American patriots have none of these things at the top or
     anywhere else, and so an effective cell organization based upon the
     Soviet system of operation is impossible.
     [INLINE] Two things become clear from the above discussion. First,
     that the pyramid form of organization can be penetrated quite easily
     and it thus is not a sound method of organization in situations
     where the government has the resources and desire to penetrate the
     structure, which is the situation in this country. Secondly, that
     the normal qualifications for the cell structure based upon the Red
     model does not exist in the U.S. for patriots. This understood, the
     question arises "What method is left for those resisting state
     tyranny?"
     [INLINE] The answer comes from Col. Amoss who proposed the "Phantom
     Cell" mode of organization which he described as Leaderless
     Resistance. A system of organization that is based upon the cell
     organization, but does not have any central control or direction,
     that is in fact almost identical to the methods used by the
     committees of correspondence during the American Revolution.
     Utilizing the Leaderless Resistance concept, all individuals and
     groups operate independently of each other, and never report to a
     central headquarters or single leader for direction or instruction,
     as would those who belong to a typical pyramid organization.
     [INLINE] At first glance, such a form of organization seems
     unrealistic, primarily because there appears to be no organization.
     The natural question thus arises as to how are the "Phantom Cells"
     and individuals to cooperate with each other when there is no
     inter-communication or central direction?
     [INLINE] The answer to this question is that participants in a
     program of leaderless resistance through "Phantom Cell" or
     individual action must know exactly what they are doing and how to
     do it. It becomes the responsibility of the individual to acquire
     the necessary skills and information as to what is to be done. This
     is by no means as impractical as it appears, because it is certainly
     true that in any movement all persons involved have the same general
     outlook, are acquainted with the same philosophy, and generally
     react to given situations in similar ways. The previous history of
     the committees of correspondence during the American Revolution
     shows this to be true.
     [INLINE] Since the entire purpose of leaderless resistance is to
     defeat state tyranny (at least in so far as this essay is
     concerned), all members of phantom cells or individuals will tend to
     react to objective events in the same way through usual tactics of
     resistance. Organs of information distribution such as newspapers,
     leaflets, computers, etc., which are widely available to all, keep
     each person informed of events, allowing for a planned response that
     will take many variations. No one need issue an order to anyone.
     Those idealists truly committed to the cause of freedom will act
     when they feel the time is ripe, or will take their cue from others
     who precede them. While it is true that much could be said against
     this kind of structure as a method of resistance, it must be kept in
     mind that leaderless resistance is a child of necessity. The
     alternatives to it have been shown to be unworkable or impractical.
     Leaderless resistance has worked before in the American Revolution,
     and if the truly committed put it to use themselves, it will work
     now.
     [INLINE] It goes almost without saying that Leaderless Resistance
     leads to very small or even one-man cells of resistance. Those who
     join organizations to play "let's pretend" or who are "groupies"
     will quickly be weeded out. While for those who are serious about
     their opposition to federal despotism, this is exactly what is
     desired.
     [INLINE] From the point of view of tyrants and would-be potentates
     in the federal bureaucracy and police agencies, nothing is more
     desirable than that those who oppose them be UNIFIED in their
     command structure, and that EVERY person who opposes them belong to
     a pyramid style group. Such groups and organizations are easy to
     kill. Especially in light of the fact that the Justice (sic)
     Department promised in 1987 that there would never be another group
     to oppose them that they did not have at least one informer in!
     These federal "friends of government" are ZOG or ADL intelligence
     agents. They gather information that can be used at the whim of a
     federal D.A. to prosecute. The line of battle has been drawn.
     [INLINE] Patriots are REQUIRED, therefore, to make a conscious
     decision to either aid the government in its illegal spying (by
     continuing with old methods of organization and resistance), or to
     make the enemy's job more difficult by implementing effective
     countermeasures.
     [INLINE] Now there will, no doubt, be mentally handicapped people
     out there who will state emphatically in their best red, white, and
     blue voice, while standing at a podium with an American flag draped
     in the background and a lone eagle soaring in the sky above, that,
     "So what if the government is spying? We are not violating any
     laws." Such crippled thinking by any serious person is the best
     example that there is a need for special education classes. The
     person making such a statement is totally out of contact with
     political reality in this country, and unfit for leadership of
     anything more than a dog sled in the Alaskan wilderness. The old
     "Born on the Fourth of July" mentality that has influenced so much
     of the Aryan-American Patriot's thinking in the past will not save
     him from the government in the future. "Reeducation" for
     non-thinkers of this kind will take place in the federal prison
     system where there are no flags or eagles, but an abundance of men
     who were "not violating any laws.".
     [INLINE] Most groups who "unify" their disparate associates into a
     single structure have short political lives. Therefore, those
     movement leaders constantly calling for unity of organization,
     rather than the desirable Unity of Purpose, usually fall into one of
     three categories:
    1. They may not be sound political tacticians, but rather, just
       committed men who feel unity would help their cause, while not
       realizing that the government would greatly benefit from such
       efforts. The Federal objective, to imprison or destroy all who
       oppose them, is made easier in pyramid organizations.
    2. Or, perhaps, they do not fully understand the struggle they are
       involved in, and that the government they oppose has declared a
       state of war against those fighting for faith, folk, freedom,
       property and constitutional liberty. Those in power will use any
       means to rid themselves of opposition.
    3. The third class calling for unity, and let us hope this is the
       minority of the three, are men more desirous of the supposed power
       that a large organization would bestow, than of actually achieving
       their stated purpose.
     [INLINE] Conversely, the LAST thing federal snoops want, if they had
     any choice in the matter, is a thousand different small phantom
     cells opposing them. It is easy to see why. Such a situation is an
     intelligence nightmare for a government intent upon knowing
     everything they possibly can about those who oppose them. The
     Federals, able to amass overwhelming strength of numbers, manpower,
     resources, intelligence gathering, and capability at any given time,
     need only a focal point to direct their anger [ie Waco]. A single
     penetration of a pyramid style organization can lead to the
     destruction of the whole. Whereas, leaderless resistance presents no
     single opportunity for the Federals to destroy a significant portion
     of the resistance.
     [INLINE] With the announcement of the Department of Justice (sic)
     that 300 FBI agents formerly assigned to watching Soviet spies in
     the U.S. (domestic counter-intelligence) are now to be used to
     "combat crime," the federal government is preparing the way for a
     major assault upon those persons opposed to their policies. Many
     anti-government groups dedicated to the preservation of the America
     of our Forefathers can expect shortly to feel the brunt of a new
     federal assault upon liberty.
     [INLINE] It is clear, therefore, that it is time to rethink
     traditional strategy and tactics when it comes to opposing state
     tyranny, where the rights now accepted by most as being inalienable
     will disappear. Let the coming night be filled with a thousand
     points of resistance. Like the fog which forms when conditions are
     right, and disappears when they are not, so must the resistance to
     tyranny be.
     Leaderless Resistance first appeared in The Seditionist in 1992. The
     author, Louis Beam, is one of the most respected racialist leaders
     in the world (within racialist circles, that is), and has
     established his own homepage to distribute his work.

* Sender: owner-cypherpunks
This reads as real, not the mindless rehashing of almost'was that typically
characterizes the posts from "Linda Reed".
Linda, are you sure you didn't eat the drugs, and imagine you were a space
  As Carlos S. Thompson and Hunter Castenada would no doubt agree,
keeping track of what Was/!Was (TM), when surfing a Digital Mind
Wave on a hacked machine with both MultiMedia and MultiReality
capabilities, can sometimes leave one confused as to where OneSelf
(1) ends, and where the Other/GreatVoid (0) begins.
  Adding to the confusion is the fact that the normal True/False
values returned by IfAndOrWhoTheFuckWantsToKnowConditionalParole
Statements, is (1) for True, and (0) for False, making it very
easy for graduates of the Richard Nixon School of Reality to
believe that OneSelf is always right, while the Other is always
wrong, and that thus, They (TM) are out to get you, and that if
they succeed, They won't have Little Jimmy Hacker's Sack to kick
around anymore.
  On the other hand, the recent proliferation of rattlesnakes and
tarantulas showing up, out of the blue, on the doorstep of the
abode in which I am currently residing, as well as underneath the
desk from which I am currently canning the small squares of pink,
digital flesh being marketed on the CypherPunks Disturbed Male
LISP, leads me to believe that, unless I am picking up visions
of pre-release Stephen King novels through the fillings in my teeth, then some part of what I am writing must be true enough
to be pissing *someone* off...
  Regretfully, although I have been driving the tarantulas out into the desert and releasing them (next to the mayor's house),
I have not checked to see if they actually contain little, tiny
brain electrodes in their skulls, whereby they may be directed
by remote control toward me, specifically, by the children of
spooks who really haven't gotten the hang of the new technology,
yet, and who seize the opportunity to grease the family income
by putting their relatives on the payroll.
  Now, as far as the posts to the CypherPunks list purporting to
be from thirteen year-old nymphomaniacs and pipe-bomb avacados,
far be it from me to imagine, even in my deepest fits of raging
paranoia, that these might be some cheap attempt at getting me
to reply, given my past long, ramblind diatribes on young boys'
hardware, and young girls' software, not to mention the silly
allegations about Canada-wide warrants out for my arrest on Mad
Bomber charges.
  As I will soon extrapolate (this is the *wrong* word to use,
here, but it sounds so much like it has to do with leather, and
bondage, that I couldn't help myself...) on, any Spook/LEA who
took the time and trouble to run previous editions of my many
public eruditions through their ComputerizedPersonalProfiling
System would undoubtedly find that any entrapment aimed toward
me, personally, should use bait which smelled like BitchInHeat
sprayed on a NuclearSuitcaseMoustrap. [Not to mention, as I will explain in more detail, early next week, trolling for interest/information on the on-site preparation
of anthrax-related types of substances which could be safely created without risk of self-exposure, if one were to have an interest in, let's say, for the sake of argument, wiping out all of the members of an enemy training camp, leaving nothing but a
PileOfBones where a GangOfOppressors previously existed.]
  Of course, any wild-eyed conspiracy theory involving a group
of individuals capable of monitoring the populace and having
agents in place throughout society who were in a position to
use detailed, effective personality profiles to control, fuck with or entrap an astounding number of individual members of the
citizenry, would have to include hard evidence of research and
experimentation in these areas.
  No problem...
  The OfficiallyDeclaredGoodGuys working for GodBlessAmerica
SecretSpyAgencies, as opposed to SecretSpyAgencies of EvilForeign
GovernmentsofDarkerSkinnedPeople, always seem to find themselves
forced to, in order to develop the capacity to be here to help
us, study, in detail, the techniques and methods of the most vile,
depraved monsters on the face of the earth.
  Thus CIA brainwashing researchers such as psychologist John
Gittinger, in order to prepare to 'help' us, needed not only to
study the records of the Nazi medical butchers at Dachau, and the
techniques of Communist Chinese brainwashing methods, but even to
pore over ancient documents which went as far back as the Spanish
[Note From The Author: I would be the last to cast aspirsions on
 Mr. Gittinger doing his job, any more than I would do so on the
 Allan Memorial Institute Staff Members who chased an escaping
 Lauren G. up Mount Royal, in her attempts to escape the mind-
 butchery of Dr. Ewen Cameron, and, after dragging back, "shot her
 full of sedatives, attached electrodes to her temples, and gave
 her a dose of electroshock," or, even cast aspersions on those
 nice folks at the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City who
 were only doing their jobs--and if a few people get their minds
 destroyed, or children are burned alive in an agonizing, horrible
 death as a result of these people doing their jobs, who am I to
 complain, since things are OK for me...I'm eating regularly, TV
 has been pretty good this week, and I was only beaten by guys
 who looked a lot like Mounties, with a member of the Pima County
 Sheriff's Department looking on, a single time this week.]
  In order to put the efforts of our GodBlessAmerica SecretSpys
to crack open the secrets of the BadMindControllers, as well as
the minds of their own test subjects, into proper perspective,
we must take note that, according to Harold Wolff, a professor of
neurology and psychology at Cornell University,
  "The problem faced by the physician is quite similar to that
faced by the Communist interrogator."
  John Marks explains that,
  "Both would be trying to put their subject back *in*harmony*
with*his*environment*, whether the *problem* was headache or
*ideological*dissent*." and that,
  "He felt he could help his patients by putting them into an
isolated, disoriented state, from which it would be easier to
create new behavior patterning."
[EditWhore's Note: A quick perusal of the Mission Statements of
 a wide variety of groups, organizations and agencies, such as
 the Moonies, the Mafia, the CIA, the Political Party Machines,
 the American Psychiatric Association, our Mothers and Fathers,
 Teachers and Principals, were all trying to use 'Differential
 Amnesia/PsychicDriving' because they were from SelfDeclared
 Authority, and they were there to Help (TM) us...]
[Note From T. Arthur: I, personally, have had so much Help (TM)
 during my lifetime, that I have had to have reconstrutive surgery
 on my ButtHole six times.]
  Anyway...
  The *BadNews*, for those concerned about the 'potential' for
current InterNet/Computer Technology to be used in putting us all
in little digital boxes (for future herding into little digital
feeding pens, to eventually be heavily salted and spit out into snack-bowls on the counters of Reptilian Nazi bars, during Happy
For*Some*OfUsHour), is that the work towards eventually being
able to take polls of the *average* public mind, as well as making
the public mind *average*, has been going on at a hectic pace for
over a half-century, and that Computer/InterNet technology is
merely icing on the cake for the Controllers who already know
that the 'MineSweeper' game in Windows is even more fun when played in the MeatSpace of ThirdWorldCountries, using children
as playing pieces, to guess where the mines are.
("OK, Raoul, now take two steps to the left...")
  In the late thirties and early forties, a variety of university
educators/researchers were involved in the twin areas of devising
ways to measure/categorize the populace and influence/program the
citizenry, as well.
 General Donovan enlisted Harvard psychology professor H. Murray
to devise a testing program to help sort through the recruits
being rushed through the OSS. This systematic effort to evaluate
an individual's personality, in order to predict his future
behavior, would soon be used in large corporations, starting
with AT&T.
  Around the same time, Erich Fromm's 1930's questionnaire, which
had been devised to psychoanalyze German workers as being either
"authoritarian," "revolutionary," or "ambivalent," was changed
by Theodor Adorno to be used in a more politically correct manner,
measuring the "democratic personality," rather than measuring the
"revolutionary personality." (TroubleMakers, all of them...)
  The end-goal of this fixation on 'measuring,' of course, is
to weed out the misfits, and to recognize which individuals would
benefit from a 'reeducation' of their basic world view.
  Madison Avenue would fund much of the public-opinion survey
development used to guage and measure different categories of
the citizenry, while the Office of Radio Research at Columbia
University would emerge from the MindControlCloset as the Bureau
of Applied Social Research, with Cominterns' Lazersfeld turning
his attentions to psychoanalyzing American voting behavior.
  Naturally, the first American President elected with the Madison
Avenue and Social Research agencies in full control of the his
campaign, was a military man, former General, Dwight Eisenhower.
  By the time that MassMindControl techniques were sufficiently
developed to enable them to be used influence the election of our
political leaders, MKULTRA resident psychologist, John Gittinger,
had apparently learned enough about interrogation from his study
of the Spanish Inquisition, Dachau, Communist China, etc., to
create a unique system for assessing personality and predicting
future behavior.
  His 'Personality Assessment System' (PAS), has not only been
described as "the key to the whole clandestine business," but was
quickly integrated into government, education, military, cororate
and societal arenas as a means of determining the future, and the
positions to be held, by those who had been categorized by the
plethora of variations that were generated from Gittinger's work.
  One of the keys to Gittinger's PAS, was it's ability to reveal,
with "uncanny accuracy," how well people were able to "adapt their
social behavior to the demands of the culture they lived in."
  In essence, it was the perfect tool for weeding out the trouble
makers and misfits who were incapable or unwilling to 'adapt' to
whatever elements of society and culture which were deemed to
be 'important' by those in charge of developing the tests.
  Gittinger was funded under the cover of the Human Ecology Found-
ation, and CIA officials considered his work to be such a major
triumph in mind-control technology, that they moved his base of
operations to a CIA proprietary company, Psychology Assessment
Associates, in Washington.
  They provided psychological services for American corporations
overseas, with branch offices in Hong Kong, Europe, and throughout
the Far East, enabling them to influence the nature and types of
the 'personalities' that would move into positions of influence
in American firms around the world.
  The Human Ecology Foundation literally inundated the research
and educational community with hundreds of thousands of dollars
in grants to expand the range of the PAS to include a wide variety
of government, educational, corporate and social arenas, including
a grant to the Educational Testing Service, which prepares the
College Board Exams which decides who advances in the American
system of higher education.
  David Saunders, in charge of the ETS's research, studied the
correlation between brain (EEG) patterns and the College Board
Exams results, as well as helping Gittinger apply the system to
other countries and cultures.
  Gittinger, who was "building a unique database on all phases
of human behavior" (Gee, I wonder what for...), was able to do
a bang-up job in this area, as a result of the Human Ecology
Foundation being able, as the project funder of most research
in this area, to require the researchers to provide them with
the gathered data.
  John Marks tells us,
  "Gittinger collected Wechslers of businessmen, students, high-
priced fashion models, doctors, and just about any other discrete
group he could find a way to have tested. In huge numbers, the Wechslers came flowing in, 29,000 sets, in all, by early 1970's,
each one accompanied by biographic data."
  Gettinger particularly sought out results on deviant forms of
personality--people who had rejected the values of their society
or who had some hidden vice--since, although the PAS had become
the darling of the psychological research community, it's chief
purpose was to expand, into the public sector, the clandestine
art of "assessing and exploiting human personality and motivations
for ulterior purposes," as the CIA Inspector General said in 1963,
while giving high marks to the PAS meeting the "prime objectives"
of "control, exploitation, or neutralization," while recognizing
that "These objectives are innately anti-ethical rather than
therapeutic in their intent."
  As John Marks succinctly states, "In other words...the business
of the PAS, like that of the CIA, is control."
  Those who are particularly enamored of themselves, due to how
superiorly they performed on their College Entrance Exams, will
be happy to know that, if they find themselves unemployed, they
may well have a position waiting for them in Uruguay, where John
Gittinger took a personal hand in using the PAS to help the CIA
select members of an anti-terrorist police unit known for their
incredibly brutal methods, including torture.
  A former CIA psychologist states, "If you put a lot of money out
there, there are many people who are lacking the ethics even of
the CIA." He adds that the U.S. has become an extremely control-
oriented society from the classroom to politics to television
  John Marks notes, "Spying and the PAS techniques are unique only
in that they are more systematic and secret."
  Another CIAMindControlJustifyingAngel, a Technical Services
Section (capable of writing *real* 'poison pen letters') scientist
speaks of the CIA 'behavioral research' being, as Marks describes
it, "a logical extension of the efforts of American psychologists,
psychiatrists,and sociologists to change behavior," with their
motivation being to "manipulate their subjects in trying to make
mentally disturbed people well, in turning criminals into law-
abiding citizens, and in pushing poor people to get off welfare."
  The CIAMindControlJustifyingAngel cites these as examples of "behavior control modification for socially acceptable reasons
which...change from time to time" in regard to the public's   What the scientist fails to mention, is that virtually all of
the research and experimentation in the above areas has resulted
from the work being funded and directed by secret government
agencies who *direct* the work into these areas.
 (e.g. - Psychedelic therapy being wholly instigated by the CIA
  and Military Intelligence, until they pulled the plug overnight,
  after their own needs had been met, at which time all of the
  doctors, patients and research subjects could GoFuckThemselves!)
  Not only are minimum-wage employees at the local Circle-K
convenience store chosen by CIA proxy, but also an amazing number
of current research subjects in experiments which, on the surface,
seem to be perfectly legitimate.
  A great deal of this mind-control experimentation has been done under the guise of research on alcoholism and mental illness.   For instance, one of the first external applications of John
Gittinger's CIA/PAS work was the Hoffer-Osmond Diagnostic Test
for Schizophrenia.
  Hoffer and Osmond had received a lot of CIA funding to do work
with alcoholics, who were good subjects for mind-control work, as
their was no real 'treatment' involved, which would only interfere
with the true purposes of the experiments and research.
  Once the PAS made it possible for the CIA to efficiently and
effectively test subjects for their suitability for MKULTRA mind-
control work, the Hoffer-Osmond Diagnostic Test was miraculously born, wherein a wide range of people who would have ordinarily
received varying diagnoses, were suddenly classified under the
umbrella of Schizophrenia, which, lo and behold, CIA/Rockerfeller
Foundation grantee physicians had discovered could be 'treated'
with OrthoMolecular (Vitamin) Therapy, which, conveniently, would
also not interfere with the methods and goals of the current mind-
control experiments, since the MKULTRA was no longer interested
in finding out the potential of mind-control techniques dependent
on the subjects being whacked-out on heavy drugs.
  In the end, we are left with a disturbing picture of American
Military and Government Secret Intelligence Agencies being the
driving force behind the instigation of almost all modern research
into a wide variety of Scientific Arenas which are coordinated
under the universal umbrella of the Controllers, the goal being
to have access to the information and tools necessary to herd us
all into categories from which we can then be spit out into the
system into a predesignated position in society, or just plain
spit out...
  ou remember the BadNazis, don't you? ou know, the ones who
were sentenced to be hung at the Nuremberg trials, for engaging
in research that U.S. Military Intelligence immediately grabbed,
in order to 'study'?
  Well, it turns out that many of the BadNazis were magically
turned into GoodNazis, by the waving of a DeNazification Wand.
  And who was 'waving' this DeNazification Wand?
  The UsualSuspects, of course...
  Dr. Ewen Cameron, the man who butchered the minds of women who
were suffering from nothing more than menopause or post-partum
depression, was a DeNazification WandWaver.
  A variety of Commintern's I.S.P. were involved in deciding who
got WavedAt with the DeNazification Wands, and who got Whacked
by them, including I.S.P.'s Marcuse, Neumann and Kirchheimer,
who wrote the Denazification Guide.
  Most amazingly of all, many of those chosen as being suitable
candidates for DeNazification, were hand-picked for eligibility
for entry into the U.S. under new identities, as part of Project
PaperClip, by one of the main BumBuddies of the AngelOfDeath,
Josef Mengeles.
[Note from T. Arthur: Although the actual whereabouts of the  AngelOfDeath have remained a matter of speculation and debate
 over the years, I have reason to believe, as a result of the
 information I received from attaching a 9V battery to the
 electrodes implanted in the skull of yet another Tarantula
 who emerged from under my computer desk, scant minutes ago,
 that Dr. Mengeles is currently living next door to me, with
 his rent being paid by the RCMP and the CIA.
 Those who wish to verify this information for themselves will
 be able to locate the Tarantula in Tucson, outside of the  mayor's home, in about an hour.]
  While the Controllers continue to yank the mental and emotional
chains of the general public, through use of OfficiallyRecognized
BadGuys, and the 4HorseMen, etc., they seem to have absolutely no
qualms about importing the Monsters into America and setting them
up with the best of what the country has to offer, in order to
further government interest in activities which have resulted
in death sentences to those on the 'losing' end of various wars,
as well as giving high-level positions to those capable of helping
the GoodGuys to tweak the MindControl technology used by the Bad
Guys, to exercise BadSocialControl, so that the GoodGuys can use
that same technology to exercise GoodSocialControl.
[I've got to go now. I just finished filling out the application
 for my Fresh Values Card, from Smith's, which gives me a nickle
 off on a can of beans for informing them which of my neighbors
 have Jewish blood coursing through their veins. (ou need to turn
 in five Jews, and I only know three, so I fudged on a couple of
 the entries...) - T. Arthur]

The abundance of black widow spiders, timber rattlers and copperheads here in
the yeastern US doesn't bother me. It's the incessant patterned interference
displayed on the TV, the fact that all the light fixtures and wall sockets are
loose and missing screws, and all my new neighbors are young retirees wearing
dark blue baseball caps (how'd they find this god forsaken snake pit?), that
brother me so much.
It's queer how much telephone maintenance is required in this rural setting. If
there's as much maintenance in the rest of the service area as there is around
my residence and place of employment, then why is the line quality so poor
(constant clicks, echoes and tone changes)? Granted most of these telephone
maintenance guys aren't doing anything when I pass them, they're all wearing
dark glasses and seem to be listening for something in their air conditioned
utility vans.

  I find it interesting that shortly after taking up residence at a
lady friend's house in Tucson, her phone went out and had to be 'fixed'
by the local Teleco.
 Naturally, the guy who came to 'fix' the phone was, as you point out,
wearing dark glasses, and, after messing with the box on the side of
the house, declared that the problem was at the Teleco end, and that
the phone would work after he returned downtown to finish 'fixing' the

have feeds on the same line, and the only one that had a 'problem' was
the one I am at.
  I took the liberty of popping open the Teleco box on the side of the
house, and found a wiring scheme which is very creative in the way
that it routes the transmissions.

Beans, Beans, They're Good For The Heart - SAHMD!!!
  But they are very, very bad for the lungs.
  By popular request, as a result of a plethora of requests being
forwarded to me by , even though I had no idea
that so many subscribers to the CypherPunks list were aware of
the true existence of the DevNullServer, I will expand a bit on
the simplicity of the on-site creation of biochemical substances
with the capacity to neutralize ExcessivelyAcidicAuthoritarians.
  Reading the literature on the production of such biochemical agents as Rincin, etc., one is struck by the need to go to great
lengths to prevent being struck by the end-results of one's own
experimentation in the creation of such substances.
  The need for outrageously complex security precautions in the
preparation of biochemical agents makes the task prohibitive for
those with limited access to funds and/or proper tools for the
job. Or so it would seem...
  The fact of the matter is, if one pays close attention to the
methods and processes of producing these agents, it quickly becomes
apparent that eliminating the need for the transporting of these
substances thereby eliminates much of the need for expensive and
time-consuming safeguards against self-exposure to these deadly
  In effect, if one can develop a mechanism to produce these
biochemical agents at the site at which one wishes them to be
released, then he or she can be relaxing on a beach at Honolulu
while the little spores are busy taking care of business.
  MadBombers use timing mechanisms which delay the triggering of
their products until they have had time to start making tracks
toward the car that their government coconspirators have taken
the rear license-plate off of.
  The spawning process of biochemical agents is a natural trigger-
delay system which can be used to effectively create the desired
substances while one is using the time to beat feat to an exotic
island paradise.
  Spawning biochemical agents where 'a little goes a long way,' means
that, once the mechanism kicks in, the results will be dramatic and
  Another advantage of on-site production is that dogs which are trained to recognize the scent of biochemical agents are unlikely
to be trained to set off barking-flags over the scent of the basic
ingredients used to create those substances.
  The down-side, of course, is that one cannot be certain that the
desired substance will not be created/disseminated at a time when
a local grade-school class is visiting the site as part of an LEA
propagand exercise.
  However, if one is capable of taking the position that a government
organization which consciously places a day-care center in a federal
building known to be a soft-target for anti-government radicals, the responsibilty for their deaths falls on the government, then c'est la
  Personally, I am of the opinion that any goverment that has no qualms
about letting hundreds of poor, black men suffer the vile consequences
of untreated syphilus, burning out the brains of average citizens to
further the cause of mind-control research, expose unwitting citizens
to radiation and hallucinogenic experiments without their consent, ad
infinituum, can pretty much go fuck themselves if they attempt to
decry those who attack them as Monsters, as a result of so-called
innocents suffering as a result of the government's complacency and
audacity in deeming themselves above retribution by those they are in
the habit of so casually oppressing and persecuting.
  Anyone who wishes to attend the grand spectacle of the RCMP's
Musical Ride, during the celebration of their 150th anniversary of
keeping the average citizen from rising up against the rich and
powerful, is welcome to do so.
  However, if they find their ass getting scorched as a result of
the efforts of those being fucked in the ass by Dudley DoWrong taking
it upon themselves to throw a serious fuck back towards whence it
came, they should refrain from whining.
  Pardon me for sounding just a tad 'callous,' but I have had the
opportunity to peruse private emails and memos between various
members of Canada's Finest, and I find it rather disgusting that
they can so casually discuss the probability of their attempts to
pressure a mentally disabled person into 'cracking' resulting in
HimOrHer committing physical destruction on the local schoolchildren
(based on HisOrHer publication of a 'KILL THE CHILDREN!!!' Bienfait
Nutly News Special), so that they will be able to step in as the
GoodGuys who bring HimOrHer to Justice (TM), without suffering any
personal losses in the process.
  Skeptical? Ask the RCMP to provide you with a copy of the files on
the computer which they stole from me, after monitoring my website
and emails, which made it clear that my computer fulfilled an essential
role in researching my medical condition, and maintaining effective
treatment for it. Once you receive the files, read one that is named
'warning.sog,' in which Bianca forwards a file purloined from a
Canadian government computer system, which contains a discussion as
to the desirability of putting pressure on me at a time when I am
short on my medications. Do a text search on a file which suggests
that, due to my Tourette Syndrome, it is inadvisable for LEA's to
work me over for merely shouting and cursing, but that if I begin
waving my arms around, they can consider themselves in danger, and
do anything they desire to my sorry ass.
  Think I'm kidding?
  Thanks to the incredible ignorance of LEA's who believe that they
are free to monitor the communications of the citizenry, while the
reverse is illegal and unacceptable, I was afforded the opportunity
to BeatFeet across the U.S. border the day before the Mounties appeared
on my doorstep to steal my computers as punishment for speaking the
Truth, and bury backup copies of my complete hard drive, which contain
information which makes the above 'allegations' seem trite, by
  What I find hilarious is that copies of extremely culpatory and
embarassing files/emails were forwarded to a variety of those from
who they originated, yet monitoring of the ongoing investigation
in this regard indicates that the FuckWads are as conscientious
about fucking over the internal investigators as they are about
fucking over the citizenry.
  Equally hilarious is the fact that whoever is in charge of running
the Official RCMP WebSite seems to be unaware that any directory
without an 'index.html' file, when accessed, gives the user access
to *all* of the files in the directory, which makes them a very,
very bad place to wittingly or unwittingly store sensitive files.
  In case you haven't already guessed, I am currently drunk, onery
and mean.

@_subject: A Thousand Points Of Fight 
Breakthrough Texts    Leaderless Resistance
   An Essay by Louis Beam
     "Leaderless Resistance" -- Part One
     [IMAGE] The concept of leaderless resistance was proposed by Col.
     Ulius Louis Amoss, who was the founder of International Service of
     Information Incorporated, located in Baltimore, Maryland. Col. Amoss
     died more than 15 years ago, but during his life he was a tireless
     opponent of Communism, as well as a skilled intelligence officer.
     [INLINE] Col. Amoss first wrote of leaderless resistance on April
     17, 1962. His theories of organization were primarily directed
     against the threat of eventual Communist takeover in the United
     States. The present writer, with the benefit of having lived many
     years beyond Col. Amoss, has taken his theories and expounded on
     them.
     [INLINE] Col. Amoss feared the Communists. This author fears the
     federal government. Communism now represents a threat to no one in
     the United States, while federal tyranny represents a threat to
     EVERYONE. The writer has joyfully lived long enough to see the dying
     breaths of Communism, but may unhappily remain long enough to see
     the last dying gasps of freedom in America.
     [INLINE] In the hope that, somehow, America can still produce the
     brave sons and daughters necessary to fight off ever-increasing
     persecution and oppression, this essay is offered. Frankly, it is
     too close to call at this point. Those who love liberty, and believe
     in freedom enough to fight for it, are rare today; but within the
     bosom of every once great nation, there remains secreted the pearls
     of former greatness.
     [INLINE] They are there. I have looked into their sparkling eyes;
     sharing a brief moment in time with them as I passed through this
     life. Relished their friendship, endured their pain, and they mine.
     We are a band of brothers native to the soil, gaining strength one
     from another as we have rushed headlong into battle that all the
     weaker, timid men say we can not win. Perhaps not... but then again,
     perhaps we can. It's not over till the last freedom fighter is
     buried or imprisoned, or the same happens to those who would destroy
     their liberty.
     [INLINE] Barring any cataclysmic events, the struggle will yet go on
     for years. The passage of time will make it clear to even the more
     slow among us that the government is the foremost threat to the life
     and liberty of the folk. The government will no doubt make today's
     oppressiveness look like grade school work compared to what they
     have planned in the future. Meanwhile, there are those of us who
     continue to hope that somehow the few can do what the many have not.
     [INLINE] We are cognizant that before things get better they will
     certainly get worse as government shows a willingness to use ever
     more severe police state measures against dissidents. This changing
     situation makes it clear that those who oppose state repression must
     be prepared to alter, adapt, and modify their behavior, strategy,
     and tactics as circumstances warrant. Failure to consider new
     methods and implement them as necessary will make the government's
     efforts at suppression uncomplicated. It is the duty of every
     patriot to make the tyrant's life miserable. When one fails to do so
     he not only fails himself, but his people.
     [INLINE] With this in mind, current methods of resistance to tyranny
     employed by those who love our race, culture, and heritage must pass
     a litmus test of soundness. Methods must be objectively measured as
     to their effectiveness, as well as to whether they make the
     government's intention of repression more possible or more
     difficult. Those not working to aid our objectives must be
     discarded, or the government benefits from our failure to do so.
     [INLINE] As honest men who have banded together into groups or
     associations of a political or religious nature are falsely labeled
     "domestic terrorists" or "cultists" and suppressed, it will become
     necessary to consider other methods of organization, or as the case
     may very well call for: non- organization.
     [INLINE] One should keep in mind that it is not in the government's
     interest to eliminate all groups. Some few must remain in order to
     perpetuate the smoke and mirrors for the masses that America is a
     "free democratic country" where dissent is allowed. Most
     organizations, however, that possess the potential for effective
     resistance will not be allowed to continue. Anyone who is so naive
     as to believe the most powerful government on earth will not crush
     any who pose a real threat to that power, should not be active, but
     rather at home studying political history.
     [INLINE] The question as to who is to be left alone and who is not,
     will be answered by how groups and individuals deal with several
     factors such as: avoidance of conspiracy plots, rejection of
     feebleminded malcontents, insistence upon quality of the
     participants, avoidance of all contact with the front men for the
     federals - the news media - and, finally, camouflage (which can be
     defined as the ability to blend in the public's eye the more
     committed groups of resistance with mainstream "kosher" associations
     that are generally seen as harmless).
     [INLINE] Primarily though, whether any organization is allowed to
     continue in the future will be a matter of how big a threat a group
     represents. Not a threat in terms of armed might or political
     ability, for there is none of either for the present, but rather,
     threat in terms of potentiality. It is potential the federals fear
     most. Whether that potential exists in an individual or group is
     incidental. The federals measure potential threat in terms of what
     might happen given a situation conducive to action on the part of a
     resistive organization or individual. Accurate intelligence
     gathering allows them to assess the potential. Showing one's hand
     before the bets are made is a sure way to lose.
     [INLINE] The movement for freedom is rapidly approaching the point
     where, for many people, the option of belonging to a group will be
     non-existent. For others, group membership will be a viable option
     for only the immediate future. Eventually, and perhaps much sooner
     than most believe possible, the price paid for membership will
     exceed any perceived benefit. But for now, some of the groups that
     do exist often serve a useful purpose either for the newcomer who
     can be indoctrinated into the ideology of the struggle, or for
     generating positive propaganda to reach potential freedom fighters.
     It is sure that, for the most part, this struggle is rapidly
     becoming a matter of individual action, each of its participants
     making a private decision in the quietness of his heart to resist:
     to resist by any means necessary.
     [INLINE] It is hard to know what others will do, for no man truly
     knows another man's heart. It is enough to know what one himself
     will do. A great teacher once said "know thyself." Few men really
     do, but let each of us promise ourselves not to go quietly to the
     fate our would-be masters have planned.
     [INLINE] The concept of leaderless resistance is nothing less than a
     fundamental departure in theories of organization. The orthodox
     scheme of organization is diagrammatically represented by the
     pyramid, with the mass at the bottom and the leader at the top. This
     fundamental of organization is to be seen not only in armies, which
     are, of course, the best illustration of the pyramid structure, with
     the mass of soldiery (the privates) at the bottom responsible to
     corporals; who are in turn responsible to sergeants, and so on up
     the entire chain of command to the generals at the top. But the same
     structure is seen in corporations, ladies' garden clubs, and in our
     political system itself. This orthodox "pyramid" scheme of
     organization is to be seen basically in all existing political,
     social, and religious structures in the world today, from the
     Federal government to the Roman Catholic Church.
     [INLINE] The Constitution of the United States, in the wisdom of the
     Founders, tried to sublimate the essential dictatorial nature
     pyramidal organization by dividing authority into three: executive,
     legislative, and judicial. But the pyramid remains essentially
     untouched.
     [INLINE] This scheme of organization, the pyramid, is not only
     useless, but extremely dangerous for the participants when it is
     utilized in a resistance movement against state tyranny. Especially
     is this so in technologically advanced societies where electronic
     surveillance can often penetrate the structure, thus revealing its
     chain of command. Experience has revealed over and over again that
     anti-state political organizations utilizing this method of command
     and control are easy prey for government infiltration, entrapment,
     and destruction of the personnel involved. This has been seen
     repeatedly in the United States where pro-government infiltrators or
     agent provocateurs weasel their way into patriotic groups and
     destroy them from within.
     [INLINE] In the pyramid form of organization, an infiltrator can
     destroy anything which is beneath his level of infiltration, and
     often those above him as well. If the traitor has infiltrated at the
     top, then the entire organization from the top down is compromised
     and may be traduced at will.
     "Leaderless Resistance" -- Part Two
     [IMAGE] A recent example of the cell system taken from the left wing
     of politics are the Communists. The Communists, in order to get
     around the obvious problems involved in pyramidal organization,
     developed to an art the cell system. They had numerous independent
     cells which operated completely isolated from one another and
     particularly with no knowledge of each other, but were orchestrated
     together by a central headquarters. For instance, during WWII, in
     Washington, it is known that there were at least six secret
     Communist cells operating at high levels in the United States
     government (plus all the open Communists who were protected and
     promoted by President Roosevelt), however, only one of the cells was
     rooted out and destroyed. How many more actually were operating, no
     one can say for sure.
     [INLINE] The Communist cells which operated in the U.S. until late
     1991 under Soviet control could have at their command a leader who
     held a social position which appeared to be very lowly. He could be,
     for example, a busboy in a restaurant, but in reality a colonel or a
     general in the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB. Under him could be a
     number of cells, and a person active in one cell would almost never
     have knowledge of individuals who were active in other cells; in
     fact, the members of the other cells would be supporting that cell
     which was under attack and ordinarily would lend very strong support
     to it in many ways. This is at least part of the reason, no doubt,
     that whenever in the past Communists were attacked in this country,
     support for them sprang up in many unexpected places.
     [INLINE] The effective and efficient operation of a cell system
     after the Communist model is, of course, dependent upon central
     direction, which means impressive organization, funding from the
     top, and outside support, all of which the Communists had.
     Obviously, American patriots have none of these things at the top or
     anywhere else, and so an effective cell organization based upon the
     Soviet system of operation is impossible.
     [INLINE] Two things become clear from the above discussion. First,
     that the pyramid form of organization can be penetrated quite easily
     and it thus is not a sound method of organization in situations
     where the government has the resources and desire to penetrate the
     structure, which is the situation in this country. Secondly, that
     the normal qualifications for the cell structure based upon the Red
     model does not exist in the U.S. for patriots. This understood, the
     question arises "What method is left for those resisting state
     tyranny?"
     [INLINE] The answer comes from Col. Amoss who proposed the "Phantom
     Cell" mode of organization which he described as Leaderless
     Resistance. A system of organization that is based upon the cell
     organization, but does not have any central control or direction,
     that is in fact almost identical to the methods used by the
     committees of correspondence during the American Revolution.
     Utilizing the Leaderless Resistance concept, all individuals and
     groups operate independently of each other, and never report to a
     central headquarters or single leader for direction or instruction,
     as would those who belong to a typical pyramid organization.
     [INLINE] At first glance, such a form of organization seems
     unrealistic, primarily because there appears to be no organization.
     The natural question thus arises as to how are the "Phantom Cells"
     and individuals to cooperate with each other when there is no
     inter-communication or central direction?
     [INLINE] The answer to this question is that participants in a
     program of leaderless resistance through "Phantom Cell" or
     individual action must know exactly what they are doing and how to
     do it. It becomes the responsibility of the individual to acquire
     the necessary skills and information as to what is to be done. This
     is by no means as impractical as it appears, because it is certainly
     true that in any movement all persons involved have the same general
     outlook, are acquainted with the same philosophy, and generally
     react to given situations in similar ways. The previous history of
     the committees of correspondence during the American Revolution
     shows this to be true.
     [INLINE] Since the entire purpose of leaderless resistance is to
     defeat state tyranny (at least in so far as this essay is
     concerned), all members of phantom cells or individuals will tend to
     react to objective events in the same way through usual tactics of
     resistance. Organs of information distribution such as newspapers,
     leaflets, computers, etc., which are widely available to all, keep
     each person informed of events, allowing for a planned response that
     will take many variations. No one need issue an order to anyone.
     Those idealists truly committed to the cause of freedom will act
     when they feel the time is ripe, or will take their cue from others
     who precede them. While it is true that much could be said against
     this kind of structure as a method of resistance, it must be kept in
     mind that leaderless resistance is a child of necessity. The
     alternatives to it have been shown to be unworkable or impractical.
     Leaderless resistance has worked before in the American Revolution,
     and if the truly committed put it to use themselves, it will work
     now.
     [INLINE] It goes almost without saying that Leaderless Resistance
     leads to very small or even one-man cells of resistance. Those who
     join organizations to play "let's pretend" or who are "groupies"
     will quickly be weeded out. While for those who are serious about
     their opposition to federal despotism, this is exactly what is
     desired.
     [INLINE] From the point of view of tyrants and would-be potentates
     in the federal bureaucracy and police agencies, nothing is more
     desirable than that those who oppose them be UNIFIED in their
     command structure, and that EVERY person who opposes them belong to
     a pyramid style group. Such groups and organizations are easy to
     kill. Especially in light of the fact that the Justice (sic)
     Department promised in 1987 that there would never be another group
     to oppose them that they did not have at least one informer in!
     These federal "friends of government" are ZOG or ADL intelligence
     agents. They gather information that can be used at the whim of a
     federal D.A. to prosecute. The line of battle has been drawn.
     [INLINE] Patriots are REQUIRED, therefore, to make a conscious
     decision to either aid the government in its illegal spying (by
     continuing with old methods of organization and resistance), or to
     make the enemy's job more difficult by implementing effective
     countermeasures.
     [INLINE] Now there will, no doubt, be mentally handicapped people
     out there who will state emphatically in their best red, white, and
     blue voice, while standing at a podium with an American flag draped
     in the background and a lone eagle soaring in the sky above, that,
     "So what if the government is spying? We are not violating any
     laws." Such crippled thinking by any serious person is the best
     example that there is a need for special education classes. The
     person making such a statement is totally out of contact with
     political reality in this country, and unfit for leadership of
     anything more than a dog sled in the Alaskan wilderness. The old
     "Born on the Fourth of July" mentality that has influenced so much
     of the Aryan-American Patriot's thinking in the past will not save
     him from the government in the future. "Reeducation" for
     non-thinkers of this kind will take place in the federal prison
     system where there are no flags or eagles, but an abundance of men
     who were "not violating any laws.".
     [INLINE] Most groups who "unify" their disparate associates into a
     single structure have short political lives. Therefore, those
     movement leaders constantly calling for unity of organization,
     rather than the desirable Unity of Purpose, usually fall into one of
     three categories:
    1. They may not be sound political tacticians, but rather, just
       committed men who feel unity would help their cause, while not
       realizing that the government would greatly benefit from such
       efforts. The Federal objective, to imprison or destroy all who
       oppose them, is made easier in pyramid organizations.
    2. Or, perhaps, they do not fully understand the struggle they are
       involved in, and that the government they oppose has declared a
       state of war against those fighting for faith, folk, freedom,
       property and constitutional liberty. Those in power will use any
       means to rid themselves of opposition.
    3. The third class calling for unity, and let us hope this is the
       minority of the three, are men more desirous of the supposed power
       that a large organization would bestow, than of actually achieving
       their stated purpose.
     [INLINE] Conversely, the LAST thing federal snoops want, if they had
     any choice in the matter, is a thousand different small phantom
     cells opposing them. It is easy to see why. Such a situation is an
     intelligence nightmare for a government intent upon knowing
     everything they possibly can about those who oppose them. The
     Federals, able to amass overwhelming strength of numbers, manpower,
     resources, intelligence gathering, and capability at any given time,
     need only a focal point to direct their anger [ie Waco]. A single
     penetration of a pyramid style organization can lead to the
     destruction of the whole. Whereas, leaderless resistance presents no
     single opportunity for the Federals to destroy a significant portion
     of the resistance.
     [INLINE] With the announcement of the Department of Justice (sic)
     that 300 FBI agents formerly assigned to watching Soviet spies in
     the U.S. (domestic counter-intelligence) are now to be used to
     "combat crime," the federal government is preparing the way for a
     major assault upon those persons opposed to their policies. Many
     anti-government groups dedicated to the preservation of the America
     of our Forefathers can expect shortly to feel the brunt of a new
     federal assault upon liberty.
     [INLINE] It is clear, therefore, that it is time to rethink
     traditional strategy and tactics when it comes to opposing state
     tyranny, where the rights now accepted by most as being inalienable
     will disappear. Let the coming night be filled with a thousand
     points of resistance. Like the fog which forms when conditions are
     right, and disappears when they are not, so must the resistance to
     tyranny be.
     Leaderless Resistance first appeared in The Seditionist in 1992. The
     author, Louis Beam, is one of the most respected racialist leaders
     in the world (within racialist circles, that is), and has
     established his own homepage to distribute his work.

GodLess Capitalists - SPACE ALIENS HIDE M DRUGS!!!
"Centralism is dead," says Hayek; however, according to Friedman, it is not so much centralism that is dead, but rather the futility, and subsequent genre, of centralism. Dialectic construction states that government is capable of truth, given that culture is distinct from sexuality. Gonzalo implies that we have to choose between the textual paradigm of discourse and dialectic cultural theory. It could be said that the primary theme of Fielding's essay on Saussurean semiotics is the failure, and hence the rubicon, of patriarchialist truth.
"Class is part of the collapse of reality," says Lyotard. In a sense, the example of dialectic construction prevalent in JFK is also evident in Heaven and Earth, although in a more mythopoetical sense. Habermas promotes the use of the textual paradigm of discourse to attack colonialist perceptions of language.
In the works of Vinge, a predominant concept is the concept of
neocapitalist consciousness. But Lacan uses the term 'Saussurean semiotics' to denote the role of the observer as participant. The subject is interpolated into a structuralist paradigm of expression that includes truth as a totality.
If one examines the textual paradigm of discourse, one is faced with a choice: either accept dialectic construction or conclude that expression must come from the masses, but only if the premise of semiotic theory is valid; otherwise, truth is part of the praxis of sexuality. Hughes holds that we have to choose between Saussurean semiotics and dialectic construction.
Milhon's critique of the textual paradigm of discourse suggests
that the task of the reader is social comment.
--Herr Doktor Prof. T.C. May, Ing.
  See, I told you Tim May knew about that sort of crap.
  Now, Greg Broiles told me that he knew T.C. May, and I'm no Tim May, and I don't know all those fancy, intellectual words, but I've never found anything that couldn't be adequately described using the eight words you can't say on the InterNet, so I'm going to tell you all
about why the GodLess Commies kicked the MindsOfTheMassesAsses so bad
that that RockyFeller figured that if he could discover the secret of
the BullShitVic Schtick, he could finally realize his dream of having
more Dogamned money than the Pope.
  Marx and Stalin and Lenin and Chairperson Mao knew all about that
1984 stuff about controlling the people by controlling the language
and symbolism.   They also understood, like I explained before, that you don't want
your NewOldLady looking at a picture of her old boyfriend while you're
sticking your dick in her, so all of his crap, like his old love-
letters and the shirts he left behind, has got to go.
  Even more, the GodLess Commies knew that it wasn't enough to just
throw the OldBoyfriend's shit out, you had to 'deconstruct' your
NewOldLady's memory of him, even if you had to wipe her fucking mind
out with electroshock and make her listen to tape-loops.
  That RockyFeller kind of knew that, since he was doing the couch-
circuit with all of the Movers&Shakers around the globe, no matter
what their schtick was, but wasn't smart enough to figure out all of
that stuff on his own, and besides, he was pretty busy counting his
money, and that's why he paid the I.S.P.'s GodLess Commies to figure
out the best way to put the BullShitVic Schtick up the butts of the
masses via the medium of the media of Radiating Radio Waves.
  The Radio Project's GodLess Commies didn't have much money to count,
so it didn't take them long to figure out the obvious, which is that
you don't fuck with a winning game. So they figured that 'abolution
of culture' could be accomplished by making intellectual content of
the medium as close to zero as possible, and that they could 'determine
the new cultural forms' of the listeners by Pavlovian repetition which
would eventually lead to the listeners drooling on command.
  Of course, as always, the increasing 'alienation of the population' remained important, since people with a strong sense of belonging in
a family, community, social structure, etc., still had a picture of
their BoyFriend by their beside, figuratively speaking.
  The techniques to make people increasingly 'radio-minded' was to reach it's epitome in later years, with the invention of the TV-tray,
which enabled families to abandon any pretense, whatsoever, of their
family ties being stronger than their imaginary bond to Lucille Ball
and Ricky Ricardo. [WAS: Fuck mom! I LOVE LUC!]
  It was no coincidence that one of Franklin Delanor Roosevelt's main
avenues of application of Madison Avenue Plain Folk Imagery was his
FireSideChats on the medium which had become a RichCommieFeller tool
for seizing the hearts and minds of the masses.
  After all, FDR owed much of his power and success to Elanor knowing
whose ear to blow into in the Eclectic Communist Community of the day.
  The main difference between the Bolshoi Political Ballet in Russia, and the Communist TakeOver Of America, was that there was no need to
remove the heads of the politicians in power and the capitalist Money
Mongers, because the politicians and the MoneyMongers *were* the head
of the Commie/Fascist TakeOver Of America.

An all powerful federal government IS communism. Communism is the political theory that property ownership and management must be centralized under a single authority. While our current state is moving more toward a fascist approach, private ownership & central mananagement, with the increasingly extensive federal management of private business & behaviour.   See, I told you so...

  The Movers&Shakers (TM) don't fall for the old GoodLeader/BadLeader
crap that is pushed to the public. They have a foot in the door of
all of the major players backrooms and merely switch their 'allegiance'

becomes obvious.
  Neither Lenin nor Hitler borrowed money from 'dad' to start their

who have adopted children scattered all over the globe.   Likewise, SugarDaddy's BigKids in the Military and Intelligence
Agencies may fight among themselves over who sits on SugarDaddy's
knee, but when those outside the family start butting in, then the CIA and the Mafia, for instance, call a truce to take care of family business.
  SugarDaddy loves his GoodKids and BadKids equally...

little details like wars that their own children are fighting interfere

Indeed, Marx's final stage of classless society, "from each according to their ability to each according to their needs", implies a level of government management that was all but impossible during his lifetime. The technology required for this level of management now exists, and is being implimented.
"Classless society" has been achieved, not by the dissolution of classes, but by the development of technology to a level that can assign each individual into his own class. Technology now allows the optimum utilization of each individual by the state. Loners can voice their objections at the US Capitol...
  Fast Freddy 'Son of Speed' Burroughs illustrates that paying the
extra few bucks for a priority connection to the ClueServer pays off,
in the long run.
  He recognizes that somewhere, in an underground bunker, a Reptilian
Nazi is humoring his ScaleOfTen buddies by using the latest in secret
lavoratory developed technology to create a cross-clone being that
has the MindOfMarx, the BallsOfHitler, and the LipsOfGeorgeBush, which are intoning, "We *have* the technology!"
  All this shit was in 'The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre' in 1989, but
hardly anybody knew what the fuck was being talked about.
 (I could insert quotes that illustrate this, except I don't have
any copies of it, since ThievingFuckingMountieCriminalPricks stole
my computers, which is why I am in the middle of fucking them so
bad that they will never be the same, afterwards. I was minding my
own business, sitting at home telling the Truth over the InterNet,
when they decided they just had to fuck with me, so fuck them in
thier dirty, crimininal little assholes...)
  Anyway, what TXCSM said, in a nutshell, was that the success of
TotalWorldDomination being achieved by the Controllers was merely
dependent on development of the right tools, and tweaking them, and
that TV and the InterNet were the right tools.
  WebWorld & The Mythical Circle of Eunuchs was just written as a
fun look at a possible FutureTimeLine&SpaceWave, since The Xenix
Chainsaw Massacre had already said everything that needed to be
said, if one chose to listen.
  InfoWar was written mostly as a cross-communication tool between
Circle of Eunuchs Gorilla Cells, keeping one another updated on
each other's progress.
  Space Aliens Hide My Drugs is just a rambling, nonsensical diatribe
that results when you finally snap, and decide that any Reptilian
Nazi that fucks with you is going to be repaid in Spades, perhaps
even Aces&Eights, since I am playing with a deck that is a little
*too* full, if you know what I mean.
  Regardless, to get back to answering the question that Declan, GodLessSchill of the TrilateralCPU, asked, about why I send this
crap to the CypherPunks...it is because those who make this list
their home instinctively know what I have been preaching since
1989--and no doubt some of them have been preaching it since
long before that--the InterNet is going to be the Final Frontier
of the Battle for Freedom and Privacy between the Controllers
and the Citizenry.
  The CypherPunks understand: "THE (TM) *have* the technology."
  WeTheSheeple have been getting their asses kicked on the
Frontiers of Rights & Freedoms, without even seeming to realize, for the most part, that they are in a fight.
Fresh From The ClueServer:
  Even the Nazis didn't start the CattleCars openly rolling to the Auschwitz Spa & Resort until they were in a position of total control.
  It is *not* OK that the government is taking away our rights
and freedoms, as well as our means to defend ourselves against
them, because they are *our* government, because they are the
GoodGuys, because they have GoodIntentions, because they are
only FuckingUsALittleBit(ForNow), because we are *comfortable*
and ThingsAren'tReallyAllThatBad(et)...
  Think about what *you* have done, personally, to guarantee
the continuation of your rights and freedoms.
  Think about whether you deserve any rights or freedoms.
(es, *deserve*...they ain't, contrary to popular opinion,
 free for the taking...)
  Think about why the government continues a WarOnDrugs which
has been completely ineffective in stopping drug use, in the
least, and has only resulted in the imprisonment of more of
our citizens than the most evil of dictators that the RoyalWe
point our fingers at, as well as high crime rates, and the
wholesale slaughter of our youth.
  Could it be because the government knows exactly what they
are doing, and *desire* these results? Good Guess!!!
  The same goes for the majority of the ills and evils that
are part and parcel of the road that our political leaders have led us willingly down. They are no more a mistake than
the technology of Radio and TeleVision being directed towards
mindless drivel, mass hypnosis and social control programming.
  While WeTheSheeple sell our souls, our independence, our rights and freedoms, for the comfort and security of being spoon-fed our reality, while being 'protected' from the
GreatEvils that the Controllers have promoted or invented
in both our MeatSpace and our MindSpace, They (TM) have
been busy little beavers, butchering minds and lives in a
quest to gain an extra inch, here or there, in the battle
for the minds of all of humanity.
  I want you to all rise from your chairs, open your windows,
and scream, as loud as you can,

    OK, so it's a slow day and you don't have much going on.
  our sister is out of town for the weekend, your dog is
on the rag and your Visa is maxed-out. Thus, sex is not a
viable option for killing a little spare time (now a felony).
So what the hell...
  ou're going through the posts to the CypherPunks list and
you notice that the asshole who forged posts to the list in
your name (claiming that fucking two nine year-olds is just
as legal as fucking an 18 year-old) has spammmed yet another
chapter of the rambling, semi-coherent saga "The True Story
Of The InterNet" to the list.
  ou've read bits and pieces of the manuscripts (on company
time), every now and again (more out of boredom than because
of any socially or coupon redeeming content), and it bothers
you that the Author has taken concepts, themes and issues
that are important to you and put a bizarre, insane/inane
twist on them that somehow degrades and defiles them, in
spite of the fact that he sometimes supplies a remarkable
amount of documented facts and viewpoints from 'respectable
sources' in support of his vague claims and wild-eyed
    ou take great care to avoid being 'caught' reading the
manuscripts by others and you wouldn't dream of admitting
in public that you view them as anything but mindless
trash, but you keep finding yourself thinking about some
of the underlying views expressed by the Author of the
    ou've begun to realize that what troubles you about
the 'True Story Of The InterNet' manuscripts is reflective
of what bothers you about the InterNet, in general, as a
Medium/Message--the ongoing battle between order and chaos
that reins supreme within a Virtual Reality where Jane and
Joe Average can avail themselves of the same technology as
Established Authority (TM) in the battle for your attention.
  Ms. Information Highway is a Eunuch who embodies the
divergent and seemingly contradictory yin/yang qualities
that would result from a cross-cloning of Walter Cronkite
and the BlondeBimbo that everyone tells the jokes about.
  It's like the 'science' of UFOlogy...the 'experts' in
the field often provide a well-documented trail of facts
and figures from recognized sources and authorities. The
problem, of course, is that the facts and figures are
used to 'prove' a wide range of Plausible Theories (TM)
ranging from highly-evolved beings with a superior
intelligence to humans, to Reptilian Nazis living deep
within the bowels of Mother Earth who are cultivating
SurfaceDwellers such as ourselves to provide a FoodFarm
for Alien GreyHound Tourists passing through on their
way to another galaxy.
  The Problem (TM) posed by the InterNet is Taoist in
  The Total Access To All Information which is inherent
in the Physical Manifestation Of Virtual Reality which
we know as the InterNet opens a Dangerous Door Of
Perception leading to an environment within which we
have the possibility of being...free!
  The Freedom represented by Unrestricted Access To
Information comes from having the ability to exercise
one of the most basic of all human qualities, which is
to 'seek' knowledge in our quest for an expanding
evolutionary wisdom. The Freedom is to be able to
Search for Knowledge according to one's own personal
predilictions and desires, and to Choose from All
Available Information/Knowledge what one will use
as tools in building one's Perceived Reality.
  In a world where we have become accustomed to being
spoon-fed the information, perceptions and viewpoints
which comprise our Perceived Reality (by Officially
Recognized Authority), we suddenly find ourselves
faced with the possibility of using the technological
tools of the InterNet to direct our Attention/Perception
along vectors of our own choosing, rather than being
subjected to forced herding into the fenced pastures
and feeding pens designed by the Controllers to keep
us in an environment which is the most suitable and
convenient for their purposes.
  The Freedom is freedom from a Reality created and
governed by Official Government Pamphlets handed to us
in every area of our life.
  The Freedom is the freedom to peruse the colored charts
and diagrams provided by the Pentagon to lead us through
a maze where Gulf War Syndrome is an imaginary being that
is always just around the corner, and then to direct our
attention to the private WebSite of a Gulf War Vetran
who provides the details of his personal experience in
regard to the war and its effect on his or her life and
  The Freedom is the freedom to read the wildly rambling,
nonsensical diatribes contained in the 'True Story Of The
InterNet' manuscripts and say, "Bullshit! I'm going to
check these wild-eyed claims out for myself."
  The Freedom is freedom to chaff and winnow the original
Seed Of Knowledge in a manner that suits your desires, and
to seek out InterNet venues and personas which make your
Quest for Knowledge more complete or efficient. The
Freedom is the freedom to change the direction or the
parameters of your Quest for a specific reason, or on a
momentary whim, solely to view your Perceived Reality
from the outside, in order to get a more objective view
of the WorldReality you have constructed.
  It is in this spirit that the 'TruthChapter' is being
    TruthChapter FAQ
    --------------
5. The Medium Is The Message... The information that comes
  into our range of perceptive attention is shaped, shaded
  and molded in a manner dependent upon the medium of
  communication by which it is transmitted.
   This is true whether the Information is transmitted by
  genetics, analog or digital emmissions, is a moving and
  flowing energy, or is captured in a static, stable form.
  Fish find their way back to their birthplace by a different
  method than humans because of the difference in the mediums
  by which they receive the necessary information.
6. Salmon don't have to show a passport to an armed fish
  representing the Stream Government. Salmon don't have to
  have approval of the Church of Salmon in order to spawn.
  Salmon don't get a ticket for swimming on the wrong side
  of the stream, or for swimming too fast.
   Big fish eat little fish...in one gulp. They don't nibble
  them to death with Fish Taxes. They don't drown them at
  the stake for believing the earth is round. Fish are not
  as 'smart' or 'creative' as humans--they do not mentally
  build Empires out of Imaginary Sand Castles In The Sky
  and then eat each other in an argument over what color
  to paint the walls.
7. If Salmon could write, they would probably write a FAQ
  with Facts, instead of embellishing the information with
  vague, semi-rational references that seem to be putting
  a confusing spin on their World Of Perceived Reality for
  no other reason than fear of falling off if it ceases
  turning.
  OK, so instead of using the TruthChapter FAQ to provide
you with accurate, unbiased information with which to

little carried away, using my Substance Abuse Enhanced
Creativity (TM) to try to suck the reader into a WorldView
constructed by myself for the sole purpose of making it
the Reader's turn to buy the next round of drinks.
  Although you might regard this as merely another 'proof'
of my freely admitted diabolicallity (don't bother looking
it up in the dictionary), it is my contention that you are
only fooling yourself if you are of the belief that you
can take the facts/opinions of *anyone* at face value,
without asking questions such as:
  "Had Saint Peter already signed a BookDeal with a Bible
   publisher before authoring the Epistles which he asks
   us to take as fact, based on Faith?"
  "Did Moses have inside information that there were vast
   reserves of oil in the Promised Land?"
  "Did Job belong to an S&M cult?"
  "Was St. John the Divine 'on something' when he had his
   'Revelation' ?"
  "When Jesus performed his 'miracles', did he work with
   scantily clad, sexy assistants, in order to divert the
   attention of the crowd?"
  The point I am trying to make is that, even in the arena
of religious belief, there is a difference between Faith
and a Lobotomy. Likewise in the arenas of Politics, Family,
Business, Sports and Relationships.

  In the interests of using the True Story Of The InterNet
manuscripts as a vehicle to increase the Reader's ability
to analyze and evaluate the proffered 'information' in a
manner that utilizes the evolving technological tools of
the medium by which the manuscripts are being disseminated,
the Author is making freely available the information with
which he was planning to generate/construct a chapter with
the title, 'son of The Mother Of All Chapters'.
  By providing the Reader with the information gleaned from
the InterNet for constructing the 'son of The Mother Of All
Chapters', as well as revealing HisOrHer's secret designs
and hidden agendas culminating in the final, manifested
form of the chapter, the Author is offering you, the highly
esteemed Reader of the 'True Story Of The InterNet', an
opportunity to InterActively Participate in the process of
the construction of your personal News & Entertainment
  The reality of the time-space continuum dictates that we
must apply our time and resources in gathering and analyzing
the information by which we construct our WorldView in a
manner that best utilizes the tools at our disposal to
shape, color and mold available information, including
taking advantage of the MiniPre-Fab Realities that are
offered to us by our fellow RealityBuilders.
  Although Manufacturing Reality can be done with greater
quality control and efficiency through the sharing of
our individual Reality Products, basic economics dictates
that there are often HiddenCosts associated with believing
RealityAdvertising claims that something is 'free', in
the overall scheme of things.

up, and you end up on Information Welfare and still having
to steal your own integrity in order to pay an increasing
price for a diluted/cut product, in order to feed your

  The TruthChapter is being presented as an opportunity
to explore the possibility of weaning yourself to a
realistically supportable level of addiction to incoming
information in order to strike a balance between suffering
the pangs and arrows of outrageous fortune, in the course
of your evolution, and becoming Irrevocably Comfortably
Numb through overuse of the current OpiateOfTheMasses.
  Despite the fact that the inspiration for the process of
completing 'son of The Mother Of All Chapters' was largely
the result of the Author having his computers and notes
stolen by Officially Recognized Authorities (TM), as well
as HimOrHer descending into a depressing, primordial pit
of dysfuntional drug withdrawal, this does not, in reality,
automatically preclude the possibility that the LoftyGoals
professed by the Author in regard to the purpose of the
TruthChapter *could* be true...
An Exercise For The Reader:
1. Read 'Son.doc' in order to familiarize yourself
  with the all-too-predictable paranoid conspiracy
  theory slant that the Author had planned to put upon
  the information gathered for the assembly of the
  'son of The Mother of All Chapters'.
   The Son.doc attachment is an incomplete preliminary
  summary/first-draft of the 'son of The Mother Of All
  Chapters', as envisioned by the Author.
2. Read 'ThePlot.txt' in order to get the general gist
  of the Spin that the Author had planned to put on
  the analysis and evaluation of the information that
  had been gathered.
3. Read 'FDR.doc' and 'FDR2.doc' to familiarize yourself
  with the building blocks with which the Author had
  planned to construct 'son of The Mother Of All Chapters',
  as well as HisOrHer notes regarding HisOrHer personal
  knowledge and experience that could be added to support
  HisOrHer's personal WorldView.
4. Write the fucking chapter yourself!
5. Disseminate the chapter to whomever you please, in any
  manner you please. (e.g. - snailmail to your mom, email
  to the CypherPunks Distributed Mailing List, or as an
  email reply to those who bless you with 'Make $$$ Fast!"

July, 1948:
The moment has come when the costumes, the grease paint, the falsely
colored scenery, the technicolored spotlights and all the other artifices
of makeYDup should be put aside and, in the interest of truth, the solid
facts about the play and the players revealed to the people. ~ The Roosevelt Myth, Preface to the Popsvox PublishingR edition Dec. 7, 1941

Version 1.7, Rev B:
Saturday morning, March 4, 1933...the conquering Democrats poured into
the city...
Only a week before an assassin's bullet had barely missed Roosevelt.
struck Anton Cermak, the Bohemian mayor and boss of Chicago, who with
Al Smith, had opposed Roosevelt's nomination...and died a few days
later. Version 2.7, Rev. 3:
On February 1, 1933, in Miami, Florida Giuseppe Zangara fired five
shots a President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was making an impromptu speech while sitting in an open car that had stopped momentarily.
Although none of the shots hit President Roosevelt, Zangara mortally
wounded Anton Cermak, the Mayor of Chicago, and hit four other people,
including a Secret Service agent.
Version 3.9, Rev. 2-B:
On February 15, 1933, Zangara attended a speech given by Roosevelt
at Bayfront Park in Miami, Florida.
When Roosevelt had finished his talk and was preparing to leave, Zangara
pulled out a pistol and opened fire.
Zangara wounded five people who had been near the president-elect,
two of them seriously. Most critically injured was Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak,
who was struck by the bullet in the chest which then lodged in his
spine. Version 4.9, Rev. 8C:
The parade car moved slowly down the street as President-elect Roosevelt
and Mayor Cermak smiled and waved. The car stopped and President-elect
Roosevelt gave a speech while sitting on the back of the car. A man
named Guiseppe Zangara pushed through the crowd. He fired five shots at the
President-elect. The bullets hit four people and Mayor Cermak.
Version 15.6, Rev. 7:
On March 6, Mayor Cermak died from complications stemming
from the shooting. The same day Zangara was indicted by a
grand jury and charged with first degree murder in the death of
Cermak. His trial began on March 9 and ended on March 11
with a guilty verdict and a death sentence. The prisoner was
transported to the Florida State Prison at Raiford, where he was
executed on March 20, 1933. Version 18.9, Rev. 5D:
Mayor Anton J. Cermak died three weeks later, on March 8, 1933. His
body was taken back to Chicago and buried in the Bohemian National
Guiseppe Zangara was executed in the electric chair on March 21, 1933.
That was only 13 days after Mayor Cermak died.
Version 32.9, Rev. 12:
Consider the case of Guiseppe Zangara, who was executed in 1933 for
attempted assassination of President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt in
which Chicago Mayor Anton J. Cermak was fatally shot. Zangara pleaded guilty
in state court on March 10, was sentenced to death, and was executed on
March 20 -- an interval of 10 days!
Version 82, Rev. 5Q:
After Roosevelt had delivered a speech in Florida on February 14, 1938,
Guiseppe Zangara, an unemployed bricklayer, fired six shots from a
handgun at Roosevelt from twelve yards away. The president-elect, who was sitting
in an open car, was uninjured but five other people were shot, including
Chicago mayor Anton Cernak, who was killed. Version 95, Rev. 8:
On February 15, 1933, Guiseppe Zangara rose early...

@_subject: The Plot 
The Plot of son of ?ThePlatypus
Gathered information reveals:
1. US Presidents and important political figures count
  on the Secret Service for protection. Secret Service
  agents are in the employee of the MoneyMongers who
  rule the US Treasury Department.
   Thus, if the MoneyMongers don't approve of a powerful
  individual's political policy and actions...
2. Presidents and other political figures seem to die at
  particular junctures of time wherein they have already
  served their purpose to the Controllers. (Note: 'die'
  either physically or politically.
    i.e. - FDR croaking shortly after getting Truman
    elected as the hand-picked replacement of shadowy
    figures.
3. Ronald Reagan and FDR were both 'front men' for their
  wives, and/or those in their wives shadowy background.
    FDR, through the efforts of Elanor and her cohorts,
   was paid A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS in order to
   enter the New ork governor's race.
4. Accounts of the life and times of FDR inevitably contain
  a generous sprinkling of references to Luck!
    (e.g. - Fortuitous Circumstances as opposed to PART OF
     AN EVIL PLOT B THE SECRET CONTROLLERS WHO RULE THE
     WORLD FROM BEHIND THE SCENES!!!)
5. Hitler and his Evil Empire was no more a 'fluke of nature'
  than Lenin and his Evil Empire.
   The 'infiltration' of the American political scene by a
  wide variety of people with socialist or communist beliefs
  and agendas was not some mysterious, unplanned 'accident'.
   The rise of Eugenics, with the resulting implications of
  a Master Race embodied in genetic control, was a worldwide
  phenomena promoted by intellectuals and leaders in all
  nations, not just in the nation which gave Eugenics a
  'bad name' by instituting the end result of a Planned
  Society a little too fast to prevent disturbing the
  average persons natural pace of increasing moral compromise.
6. Neither Oswald nor Hitler 'acted alone.'
   Try starting a World War without the backing and support
of the MoneyMongers and the PowerBrokers. Lots of luck...
7. After Pavlov discovered biological mechanisms for the
  control of when dogs drool, his research did not come
  to a halt.
   Political and Military Czars who had a hand in developing
  and researching brainwashing techniques epitomized by 'The
  Manchurian Candidate' did *not* decide it would be wrong
  to use the techniques, just to increase their money and
  power.
    oung boys in the throes of publerty do *not* refrain
  from imagining what their large-breasted teacher would
  look like, naked, after reading 'The Invisible Man'.
8. Viewing the life and times of FDR (and probably any other
  political/religious leader) is *scary* if one lets their
  mind contemplate the 'possibility' of deep, dark conspiracy
  theories being True!!
    Why? Because one can construct a Dark Theory that makes
  as much (if not *more*) sense than the Standard Authorized
  View Of History And Reality promoted in educational
  materials, government pamphlets and corporate advertising.
  (i.e. - The Allies burned a few Jews, but they didn't

It seems that the forementioned files never made it to the list
(at least as echoed by infinity.nus.sg), as a result of being
filtered out somewhere along the way due to their excessive size.
Realizing that this was likely the result of filtering for the

to take on this matter.
John informed me that one thing he learned from Dimitri was that,
"The Spammer interprets filtering as common-sense, and routes
around it."
Accordingly, I have broken the files down into FDR1.txt --> FDR8.txt,

As to the President, it is an account of an image projected upon the
popular mind which came to be known as Franklin D. Roosevelt. It is
the author's conviction that this image did
not at all correspond to the man himself and that it is now time to
correct the lineaments of this synthetic figure
created by highly intelligent propaganda, aided by mass illusion and
finally enlarged and elaborated out of all
reason by the fierce moral and mental disturbances of the war.
The moment has come when the costumes, the grease paint, the falsely
colored scenery, the technicolored
spotlights and all the other artifices of makeYDup should be put aside
and, in the interest of truth, the solid facts
about the play and the players revealed to the people. July, 1948 Preface to the Popsvox PublishingR edition Someone once said that Washington DC is a place where history is taken
for granted and granite mistaken for
history. The new FDR "memorial" is notable for what it forgets. John
T. Flynn, active columnist and author
throughout the Roosevelt years and beyond, made an enormous contribution
to accurate reporting and
genuine understanding of the New Deal. Unfortunately, Flynn's work
has been out of print for decades while
the politically correct elite have not only preserved the myth, they
have now literally cast it in stone. Do not despair. The technology of the information age provides a remedy.
Flynn is back, facts, footnotes and
all, and in an electronically enhanced form unimagined in the age when
journalists scribbled on notepads with
pencil stubs. As a MicrosoftR WindowsR help file, it can be searched,
annotated, printed out . . . or even read,

newsgroup debaters, the electronic

a passage about the Democratic National Committee or the $3,000.000
income Eleanor took down as First Lady.

Saturday morning, March 4, 1933...the conquering Democrats poured into
the city, hastening to take over after so many hungry
years in the wilderness. Only a week before an assassin's bullet had barely missed Roosevelt.
struck Anton Cermak, the Bohemian mayor and boss of Chicago, who with
Al Smith, had opposed Roosevelt's
nomination. he got the bullet intended for Roosevelt {BIG Assumption - sog}and
died a few days later. Later, as Roosevelt's train sped from New ork to Washington carrying
himself and
his family, word came to him that aboard another train carrying the
65YDyearYDold Senator Thomas J. Walsh and
his bride of two days, the aged groom dropped dead in his Pullman drawing
room. He was speeding to the
capital to be sworn in as Attorney General. Two weeks before the lameYDduck Congress had turned a
somersault and voted the amendment to the Constitution ending Prohibition.
FortyYDone legislatures were in
session waiting eagerly for the chance to approve the wet amendment
and to slap taxes on beer and liquor to
save their empty treasuries. The country, the states, the towns needed money YD something
to tax. And liquor was the richest target. "Revenue," said one commentator,
"unlocked the gates for Gambrinus
and his foaming steed." first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have
to fear is fear
itself." "The means of exchange are frozen in the streams of trade."
"et our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken
by no
plague of locusts3,300,000,000 YD in
addition to all the other specific appropriations for government, into
his hands to be spent at his sweet will in
any way he desired. The great purse YD which is the greatest of all
the weapons in the hands of a free parliament
to oppose the extravagances of a headstrong executive YD had been handed
over to him. The "spendthrift"
Hoover was in California at his Palo Alto home putting his own affairs
in order, while the great Economizer who
had denounced Hoover's deficits had now produced in 100 days a deficit
larger than Hoover had produced in
two years. Roosevelt had no wish to stem the
panic. The onrushing tide of disaster was sweeping the slate clean
for him YD at the cost of billions to investors
and depositors. The greater the catastrophe in which Hoover went out
of power the greater would be the
acclaim when Roosevelt assumed power. For this drastic decision there could be, of course, but one excuse,
namely that Mr. Roosevelt had a definite
plan and that such a plan could be better carried out with a full disaster.
What, then, was his plan? We shall see
presently.4 the crisis had assumed a terrifying
aspect. To this was added the fear of inflation and of irresponsible
and even radical measures by the new
President. One of these, of course, was the agitation which went on
behind the scenes for the nationalization of
the whole banking system. Men close to the President-elect were known
to be for this.
Then Glass asked Roosevelt what he was going to do.
To Glass' amazement, he answered: "I am planning to close them, of
course." Glass asked him what his
authority was and he replied: "The Enemy Trading Act" YD the very act
Hoover had referred to and on which
Roosevelt had said he had no advice from Cummings as to its validity.
Glass protested such an act would be
unconstitutional and told him so in heated terms. "Nevertheless," replied
Roosevelt, "I'm going to issue a
proclamation to close the banks." After delivering his inaugural address, Roosevelt issued a proclamation
closing all banks.
They decided that the action
must be swift and staccato for its dramatic effect; that the plan,
whatever it might be, must be a conservative
one, stressing conventional banking methods and that all leftYDwing
presidential advisers must be blacked
out during the crisis; and finally that the President must make almost
at the same time a tremendous gesture in
the direction of economy.
w it is difficult to believe that it could
ever have been uttered by a man who before he ended his regime would
spend not merely more money than
President Hoover, but more than all the other 31 Presidents put together
YD three times more, in fact, than all the
Presidents from George Washington to Herbert Hoover. This speech was
part of the plan Moley and Woodin
had devised to sell the banking plan in a single package with the great
economy program. To the great audience that listened to the fireside chat, the hero
of the drama YD the man whose genius had led
the country safely through the crisis of the banks YD was not any of
the men who had wrestled with the problem,
but the man who went on the radio and told of the plan he did not construct,
in a speech he did not write. Thus
Fate plays at her ageYDold game of creating heroes. a Great Man attended by a Brain Trust to bring understanding first
and then order out of
chaos. Actually there are no big men in the sense in which Big Men are sold
to the people. There are men who are
bigger than others and a few who are wiser and more courageous and
farseeing than these. But it is possible
with the necessary pageantry and stage tricks to sell a fairly bright
fellow to a nation as an authentic BIG Man.
Actually this is developing into an art, if not a science. It takes
a lot of radio, movie, newspaper and magazine
work to do it, but it can be done. {FDR/Hitler - sog}
For the farmer the New Deal would encourage cooperatives and enlarge
government lending agencies. But the
greatest enemy of the farmer was his habit of producing too much. His
surplus ruined his prices. The New Deal
would contrive means of controlling the surplus and ensuring a profitable
price. As for business the New Deal proposed strict enforcement of the antiYDtrust
laws, full publicity about security
offerings, regulation of holding companies which sell securities in
interstate commerce, regulation of rates of
utility companies operating across state lines and the regulation of
the stock and commodity exchanges. Roosevelt in his preelection speeches had stressed all these points
YD observing the rights of the states so
far as to urge that relief, oldYDage pensions and unemployment insurance
should be administered by them, that
the federal government would merely aid the states with relief funds
and serve as collection agent for social
First of all, his central principle YD his party's traditional principle
of war upon BIG government YD was reversed.
And he set out to build a government that in size dwarfed the government
of Hoover which he denounced. The
idea of a government that was geared to assist the economic system
to function freely by policing and
preventive interference in its freedom was abandoned for a government
which upon an amazing scale
undertook to organize every profession, every trade, every craft under
its supervision and to deal directly with
such details as the volume of production, the prices, the means and
methods of distribution of every
conceivable product. This was the NRA. It may be that this was a wise
experiment but it was certainly the very
reverse of the kind of government which Mr. Roosevelt proposed in his
New Deal. Enforcement of the antiYDtrust act was a longtime pet of his party and
it was considered as an essential
instrument to prevent cartels and trusts and combinations in restraint
of trade which were supposed to be
deadly to the system of free enterprise. The New Deal had called loudly
for its strict enforcement. et almost at
once it was suspended YD actually put aside during the experiment YD
in order to cartelize every industry in
America on the Italian corporative model. {Fascism! - sog}
First, and most important, was the NRA and its dynamic ringmaster,
General Hugh Johnson. As I write, of
course, Mussolini is an evil memory. But in 1933 he was a towering
figure who was supposed to have
discovered something worth study and imitation by all world artificers
everywhere. The NRA provided that in
America each industry should be organized into a federally supervised
trade association. It was not called a
corporative. It was called a Code Authority. But it was essentially
the same thing. These code authorities could
regulate production, quantities, qualities, prices, distribution methods,
etc., under the supervision of the NRA.
This was fascism. The antiYDtrust laws forbade such organizations. Roosevelt
had denounced Hoover for not
enforcing these laws sufficiently. Now he suspended them and compelled
men to combine. In spite of all the fine words about industrial democracy, people began
to see it was a scheme to permit business men to combine to put up
prices and keep them up by direct decree or
through other devious devices. The consumer began to perceive that
he was getting it in the neck.
. A tailor named Jack Magid in New Jersey was arrested, convicted,
fined and sent to jail. The crime was that he had pressed a suit of
clothes for 35 cents when the Tailors' Code
fixed the price at 40 cents. The price was fixed not by a legislature
or Congress but by the tailors.
The NRA was discovering it could not enforce its rules. Black markets
grew up. Only the most violent police
methods could procure enforcement. In Sidney Hillman's garment industry
the code authority employed
enforcement police.8 They roamed through the garment district like
storm troopers. They could enter a man's
factory, send him out, line up his employees, subject them to minute
interrogation, take over his books on the
instant. Night work was forbidden. Flying squadrons of these private
coatYDandYDsuit police went through the
district at night, battering down doors with axes looking for men who
were committing the crime of sewing
together a pair of pants at night. But without these harsh methods
many code authorities said there could be
no compliance because the public was not back of it. "Mob rule and racketeering had a considerable
degree displaced orderly government."9 On May 27, 1935, the Supreme Court, to everybody's relief, declared
NRA unconstitutional. It held that Congress at Roosevelt's demand had
delegated powers to the President and
the NRA which it had no right to delegate YD namely the power to make
laws. It called the NRA a Congressional
abdication. And the decision was unanimous, Brandeis, Cardozo and Holmes
joining in it. But of course he had imposed it not as a temporary expedient but as
a new order and he boasted of it. He had
done his best to impose the dissolution of the antiYDtrust laws on the
country. Curiously enough, while Wallace was paying out hundreds of millions
to kill millions of hogs, burn oats, plow
under cotton, the Department of Agriculture issued a bulletin telling
the nation that the great problem of our
time was our failure to produce enough food to provide the people with
a mere subsistence diet.
Oliphant was a lawyer whose reformist addictions overflowed into every
branch of public affairs. A
devout believer in rubber laws, it was easy for him to find one which
could be stretched to include rubber
dollars. We are thus continuing to move toward a managed
currency." Roosevelt's billions, adroitly used, had broken down every
political machine in America. The patronage they once lived on and
the local money they once had to disburse
to help the poor was trivial compared to the vast floods of money Roosevelt
controlled. And no political boss
could compete with him in any county in America in the distribution
of money and jobs. The poll indicated that Long could corral 100,000 voted in New ork
State, which could, in a close
election, cost Roosevelt the electoral vote there. Long became a frequent
subject of conversation at the White
House. Dr. Carl Austin Weiss, a young physician,
eluded the vigilance of Long's guards and shot him. " A monument stands to the memory of this arch demagogue in the Hall
of Fame of the
Capitol building in Washington and his body rests in a crypt on the
state capitol grounds YD a shrine to which
crowds flock every day to venerate the memory of the man who trampled
on their laws, spat upon their
traditions, loaded them with debt and degraded their society to a level
resembling the plight of a European
fascist dictatorship. The Treasury and the Department of Justice went into action and before
long there were income tax
indictments against at least 25 of the Long leaders and henchmen. When little men think about large problems the boundary between the
sound and the unsound is very thin and vague. And when some idea is
thrown out which corresponds with
the deeply rooted yearnings of great numbers of spiritually and economically
troubled people it spreads like a
physical infection and rises in virulence with the extent of the contagion.
The spiritual and mental soil of the
masses near the bottom of the economic heap was perfect ground for
all these promisers of security and
abundance. They had cooked up for themselves that easy, comfortable potpourri
of socialism
and capitalism called the Planned Economy which provided its devotees
with a wide area in which they might
rattle around without being called Red. But the time would come when they would approach much closer
to their dream of a planned people. We shall see that later. He was a man literally without any fundamental philosophy. The positions
he took on political and economic
questions were not taken in accordance with deeply rooted political
beliefs but under the influence of political
necessity. NRA and the AAA. This was a plan to take the whole industrial and agricultural
life of the country under
the wing of the government, organize it into vast farm and industrial
cartels, as they were called in Germany,as they were called in Italy,
and operate business and the farms under plans made and carried out
under the supervision of government. As for the Reds, they did not move in heavily until the second term
and not en masse until the third
term, although the entering wedge was made in the first. And then the
point of entry was the labor movement. This thing called revolutionary propaganda and activity is something
of an art in itself.
It has been developed to a high degree in Europe where revolutionary
groups have been active for half a
century and where Communist revolutionary groups have achieved such
success during the past 25 years. It
was, at this time of which I write, practically unknown to political
and labor leaders in this country and is still
unknown to the vast majority of political leaders.
He vetoed that but had
an arrangement with the Democratic leadership that they would pass
it over his head. Thus the President could
get credit for trying to kill it while the Democrats would get credit
for actually passing it. Their chief reliance was
upon the charge that the President had usurped the powers of Congress,
attacked the integrity of the courts,
invaded the constitutional prerogatives of the states, attempted to
substitute regulated monopoly for free
enterprise, forced through Congress unconstitutional laws, filled a
vast array of bureaus with swarms of
bureaucrats to harass the people and breed fear in commerce and industry,
discourage new enterprises and
thus prolonged the depression, had used relief to corrupt and intimidate
the voters and made appeals to class
prejudice to inflame the masses and create dangerous divisions. Their chief reliance was

gavel fell to open that wild conclave to the knock of the adjourning
gavel everything that was said and done or
that seemed to just happen was in accordance with a carefully arranged
and managed scenario. The delegates
were mere puppets and answered to their cues precisely like the extras
in a movie mob scene. the South had both arms up to its shoulder blades in Roosevelt's relief
public works barrel. National politics was now paying off in the South
in terms of billions. When Alf Landon
talked about Roosevelt's invasions of the Constitution, the man on
relief and the farmer fingering his subsidy
check replied "ou can't eat the Constitution."
As to the public debt he said we
borrowed eight billions but we have increases the national income by
22 billions. Would you borrow $800 a
year if thereby you could increase your income by $2200, he asked.
That is what we have done, he answered,
with the air of a man who has easily resolved a tough conundrum. And
though the figures were false and the
reasoning even more so it was practically impossible for a Republican
orator to reason with voters against
these seemingly obvious and plausible figures. The President's victory was due to one thing and one thing only, to
that one great rabbit YD the spending rabbit YD
he had so reluctantly pulled out of his hat in 1933. This put into
his hands a fund amounting to nearly 20 billion
dollars with which he was able to gratify the appetites of vast groups
of people in every county in America
. Without the revival of investment there could
be no revival of the economic system. The system was being supported
by government spending of borrowed
funds. Roosevelt's unwillingness to compromise now angered his own supporters
who were being forced to carry this
unpopular cause. In the end he had to assure Robinson that he would
have the appointment, and then to
crown Roosevelt's difficulties, Robinson was stricken with a heart
attack in the Senate and died shortly after,
alone in his apartment. The Treasury made a practice of keeping tricky books and producing
phony results. It had merely shifted relief payments to other accounts.
They were, in fact, larger than the year
before. Then he revealed the extent of his plans YD they
would have to step up spending, forget about balancing the budget and
get along with a two or three billion
dollar a year deficit for two years. Then a conservative would come
into office. That administration would do
what Roosevelt had been promising he would do YD quit government spending.
And then the whole thing would
go down in a big crash.

There is only a limited number of things on which the federal government

The one big thing the federal government can spend money on is the

The depression which assaulted our unprepared society in 1929 was by
no means a mysterious phenomenon to
those who had given any attention to the more or less new studies in
the subject of the business cycle. It was,
first of all and essentially, one of those cyclical disturbances common
to the system of private enterprise. That
economic system has in it certain defects that expose it at intervals
to certain maladjustments. And this was
one of those intervals. Had it been no more than this it could have
been checked and reversed in two or three
years. But this cyclical depression was aggravated by additional irritants:
1. The banking system had been gravely weakened by a group of abuses,
some of which arose out of the
cupidity of some bankers and others out of ignorance. 2. A wild orgy of speculation had intruded into the system stimulated
by a group of bad practices in the
investment banking field. 3. A depression in Europe arising out of special causes there had produced
the most serious repercussions
here. The great, central consequence of these several disturbances was to
check and then almost halt completely,
the flow of savings into investment. All economists now know what few,
apparently, knew then YD that in the
capitalist system, power begins in the payments made by employers to
workers and others in the process of
producing goods. And this must be constantly freshened by an uninterrupted
flow of savings into investment
YD the creation of new enterprises and the expansion of old ones. If
this flow of savings into investment slows
down the whole economic system slows down. If it is checked severely
the whole economic system goes into a
collapse. throughout Hoover's term one of these YD the ruthless operation of gamblers
in the stock market with the
dangerous weapon of short selling YD continued to add at intervals spectacular
crashes in the market which
intensified the declining confidence of the people. But Hoover had against him, in addition to those natural, international
and social disturbances, an additional
force, namely a Democratic House of Representatives which set itself
with relentless purpose against
everything he attempted to do from 1930 on. It had a vested interest
in the depression.
and generally to do all those things he had denounced in Hoover without
the slightest foundation for
the charges.
It was always easy to sell him a plan that involved giving away government
It was always easy to interest him in a plan which would confer some
special benefit upon some special class in
the population in exchange for their votes. He was sure to be interested
in any scheme that had the appearance
of novelty and he would seize quickly upon a plan that would startle
and excite people by its theatrical
He did not dream of the
incredible miracle of government BANK borrowing. He did not know that
the bank lends money which it
actually creates in the act of making the loan. When Roosevelt realized
this, he saw he had something very
handy in his tool kit. He could spend without taxing people or borrowing
from them, while same time
creating billions in bank deposits. Wonderful! discovered what the Italian Premier Giolitti had discovered over 50
years before, that it was not necessary to
buy the politicians. He bought their constituents with borrowed money
and the politicians had to go along.
Those who, in their poverty and helplessness, refused to surrender
their independence, paid for it. A man in
Plymouth, Pa., was given a whiteYDcollar relief job before election
at $60.50 a month. He was told to change his
registration from Republican to Democratic. He refused and very soon
found himself transferred YD transferred
from his whiteYDcollar job to a pickYDaxe job on a rock pile in a quarry.
There he discovered others on the rock pile
who had refused to change their registration. This was in America,
the America of the men who were chanting
and crooning about liberty and freedom 365 days a year, who were talking
about democracy and freedom for all
men everywhere. These primaries of 1938, of course, were the scenes of the great Roosevelt
purge, when distinguished
Democratic senators and congressmen were marked for annihilation.
It had already become a crime for a Democrat to disagree with the administration

They were eager
for America to get into a war if it came. But they felt the people
had to be drawn along a little at a time. They
wanted the President to frighten the people a little as a starter.
But he increased the recommended dose. The
reaction was so violent that they felt it put back by at least six
months the purpose they had in mind YD rousing
America to a warlike mood. However, following the Panay
incident, Mr. Hull began to churn up as much war spirit as possible
and through the radio and the movies
frantic efforts were made to whip up the anger of the American people.
There never has been in American politics a religion so expansively
and luminously righteous as the New Deal.
YD war to the death upon evil, upon greed,
poverty and oppression. It had, in fact, one monstrous enemy against
which it tilted its shining spear seven
days a week and that was SIN. If you criticized the New Deal, you were
for sin. There is no vast sum of money in holding
office. The riches are in the perquisites, the graft, legal and illegal,
often collected by men who do not hold
office but who do business with those who do. Some Democratic chieftains
of the newer stripe began to drift
into vice rackets of various sorts.
It was this Tammany at its lowest level which surrendered to the New
Deal and became finally the political tool
of Mr. Roosevelt in New ork. From an oldYDfashioned political district
machine interested in jobs and
patronage, living on the public payroll and on various auxiliary grafts,
some times giving a reasonably good
physical administration of the city government, some times a pretty
bad one, some times very corrupt, some
times reasonably honest, it became a quasiYDcriminal organization flying
the banner of the Free World and the
Free Man. Cermak fought Roosevelt's nomination at Chicago, and went to Miami
in February, 1933 to make his peace with
Roosevelt where the bullet intended for Roosevelt killed him.
{Who fired the shot? - sog}
d before the House Committee Investigating UnYDAmerican Activities.
Frey, in a
presentation lasting several days, laid before the Committee a completely
documented account of the
penetration of the CIO by the Communist Party. He gave the names of
280 organizers in CIO unions It was the Communists who were engineering the sitYDdown strikes and
who instigated and organized the
Lansing Holiday when a mob of 15,000 blockaded the state capitol and
2,000 of them, armed with clubs, were
ordered to march on the university and bring part of it back with them.
At the Herald Tribune forum in New
ork City about this time the President delivered one of the bitterest
attacks he had ever made on a government
official. It was against Martin Dies for investigating these Communist
influences in the sitYDdown strikes. Sidney Hillman would become not only its
dominating mind but Roosevelt's closest adviser in the labor movement
and in the end, though not himself a
Democrat, the most powerful man in the Democratic party. Sidney Hillman28 was born in Zargare, Lithuania, then part of Russia,
in 1887. He arrived here in 1907 after a
brief sojourn in England.
it is entirely probable that Hillman, while not a Communist, was at
all times
sympathetic to the Communist philosophy. He was a revolutionist It is certain that the Russian revolution set off a very vigorous flame
in Hillman's bosom. In 1922 he hurried
over to Russia with a plan. He had organized here what he called the
RussianYDAmerican Industrial Corporation
with himself as president. Its aim was to operate the "textile and
clothing industry of Russia." Hillman's
corporation sold to labor organizations at $10 a share a quarter of
a million dollars of stock. The circular letter of
the corporation soliciting stock sales among labor unions said: "It
is our paramount moral obligation to help
struggling Russia get on her feet." Hillman went to Russia to sell
the idea to Lenin. He cabled back from
Moscow: "Signed contract guarantees investment and minimum 8 per cent
dividend. Also banking contract
permitting to take charge of delivery of money at lowest rate. Make
immediate arrangements for transmission of
money. Had long conference with Lenin who guaranteed Soviet support."
Hillman was never an outright exponent of Communist objectives. He
was, however, deeply sympathetic to the
Communist cause in Russia and to the extreme leftYDwing ideal in America,
but he was an extremely practical man
who never moved upon any trench that he did not think could be taken.
He never pressed his personal
philosophy into his union and his political activities any further
than practical considerations made wise. He was a resolute man who shrank from no instrument that could be used
in his plans. He was a cocksure,
selfYDopinionated man and he was a bitter man, relentless in his hatreds.
He had perhaps one of the best minds
in the labor movement YD sharp, ceaselessly active and richly stored
with the history and philosophy of the labor
struggle and of revolutionary movements in general. When Lewis and
Dubinsky at a later date would leave the
CIO, Hillman would be supreme and would reveal somewhat more clearly
the deep roots of his revolutionary
yearnings that had been smothered for a while under the necessities
of practical leadership. There is no doubt that Hillman was one of the first labor leaders to
use the goon as part of his enforcement
Why should LaGuardia want to scuttle the investigation of a notorious
murder? Why should the President of
the United States refuse to deliver Lepke to Dewey and thus save him
from going to the chair? Why save the
life of a man convicted as the leader of a murder syndicate? Who was
the leading politician supposed to be
involved? Who was the nationally known labor leader? The murder for which Lepke was convicted and wanted for execution by
Dewey and shielded by Roosevelt
was, as we have seen, that of Joseph Rosen. Rosen was a trucking contractor
who was hauling to nonYDunion
factories in other states for finishing, clothing cut under union conditions
in New ork. He was put out of
business by Lepke in the interest of a local of Hillman's Amalgamated
and Rosen was threatening to go to the
district attorney and tell how this was done.
But for some reason there rose to the surface at this
time a lawless element, some of them criminal, some of them lawless
in the excess of their revolutionary zeal,
some of them just plain grafters. And these elements constituted the
most powerful section of those groups
that were supporting the President. This was in no sense the Army of
the Lord, as it was so widely advertised. He wanted
ambassadors from their own countries to tell them that other governments
were "looking to Roosevelt as the
savior of the world," as he put it himself. Farley admits this was
done and says it was a mistake and that he said
so at the time. With the rise of the New Deal, however, a vast
army of persons appeared on the payroll of the federal government and
because some of the payrolls were
flexible and had no connection whatever with the Civil Service, it
was a simple matter for the government to use
this ancient but now enormously enhanced tool to control votes in particular
localities. The story of the third term campaign which we shall now see is the
story of dealing with all these
groups, and the feasibility of doing so successfully was enormously
enhanced by the fact that in September,
1939, just about the time the active work for the coming convention
was under way, Hitler marched into Poland.
{Just happens to fit right in with Planned Government/Economy - sog}
On July 17, 1940, Franklin D. Roosevelt was nominated for the presidency
for the third time. The prologue to
this event was supplied by Europe. When the convention met, Willkie
seemed the most unlikely of these candidates, but his strength grew.
Dewey was eliminated on the fourth ballot
and on the sixth, in a contest between Taft and Willkie, the latter
was nominated in one of the most amazing
upsets in convention history. The Democrats believed that Willkie would make a formidable opponent.
But from the moment he was
nominated the result of the election could no longer be in doubt. Charles
McNary, Republican leader in the
Senate, was nominated for the vice presidency. The joining of these
two men YD Willkie and McNary YD was so
impossible, they constituted so incongruous a pair that before the
campaign ended McNary seriously
considered withdrawing from the race. There was a moment in that convention when one voice was lifted in
solemn warning, the full meaning of which
was utterly lost upon the ears of the delegates. Former President Hoover,
in a carefully prepared address, talked
about the "weakening of the structure of liberty in our nation." He
talked of Europe's hundredYDyear struggle for
liberty and then how Europe in less than 20 years surrendered freedom
for bondage. This was not due to
Communism or fascism. These were the effects. "Liberty," he said, "had
been weakened long before the
dictators rose." Then he named the cause: "In every single case before the rise of totalitarian governments there
has been a period dominated by
economic planners. Each of these nations had an era under starryYDeyed
men who believed that they could plan
and force the economic life of the people. They believed that was the
way to correct abuse or to meet
emergencies in systems of free enterprise. They exalted the State as
the solvent of all economic problems. These men
shifted the relation of government to free enterprise from that of
umpire to controller. Directly or indirectly
they politically controlled credit, prices, production or industry,
farmer and laborer. They devalued,
pumpYDprimed and deflated. They controlled private business by government
competition, by regulation and by
taxes. They met every failure with demands for more and more power
and control ... societies oneYDfourth socialist, threeYDfourths
capitalist, administered by socialist ministries winding the chains
of bureaucratic planning around the strong
limbs of private enterprise. Mr. Hoover then undertook to describe the progress of this baleful
idea here in a series of headlines: Vast
Powers to President; Vast Extension of Bureaucracy; Supreme Court Decides
Against New Deal; Attack on
Supreme Court; Court Loaded with Totalitarian Liberals; Congress Surrenders
Power of Purse by Blank Checks
to President; Will of Legislators Weakened by Patronage and Pie; Attacks
on Business Stirring Class Hate;
Pressure Groups Stimulated; Men's Rights Disregarded by Boards and
Investigations; Resentment at Free
Opposition; Attempts to Discredit Free Press. e State Planned and Managed Capitalism
Roosevelt executed a political maneuver that beyond doubt caused great
embarrassment to the Republicans. He announced the appointment of Henry
L. Stimson, who had been
secretary of State under President Hoover, as Secretary of War, and
Frank Knox, candidate for vice president
with Landon in 1936, as Secretary of the Navy. He was laying his plans cunningly to have himself "drafted." The
movement began some time in 1939 and the leaders in it were Ed Kelly
of Chicago and Frank Hague of New
The debacle was the plan Roosevelt was engineering to
literally put the party out of business by inducing its leaders not
to contest his election. Commentators like
Dorothy Thompson and H.V. Kaltenborn and other proYDwar writers were
calling on the Republicans not to
contest the election. And Roosevelt schemed to induce the presidential
candidates of the party in 1936 to
become Secretaries of War and Navy respectively in his cabinet.
He has been pictured as a vague
and impractical mystic, half scientist, half philosopher, with other
ingredients that approach the pictures in the
comic strips of the professor with the butterfly net. Wallace brought men like Tugwell into the Department as his UnderYDSecretary
of Agriculture
To understand what made this thoroughly dangerous man tick it is necessary
to look at another widely
advertised side of his nature YD his interest in mysticism. Some time in the 'twenties, a gentleman by the name of Nicholas Constantin
Roerich appeared on the American
scene. Roerich was a highly selfYDadvertised great philosopher on the
Eastern Asiatic model. He gathered
around himself a collection of admirers and disciples who addressed
him as their "Guru" YD a spiritual and
religious person or teacher. He dispensed to them a philosophic hash
compounded of pseudoYDogism and
other Oriental occult teachings that certain superior beings are commissioned
to guide the affairs of mankind.
Roerich wrote a long string of books YD "In Himalaya," "Fiery Stronghold,"
"Gates Into the Future," "The Art of
Asia," "Flame in Chalice," "Realm of Light." Logvan and Logdomor
were the names by which Horch was known in this mystic circle. stories in English language newspapers in China indicated that
Roerich applied to the 15th U.S. Infantry in Tientsin for rifles and
ammunition and that the expedition had
mysterious purposes. He cried out in ecstasy in a speech: "The people's revolution is on
the march and the devil and all his angels
cannot prevail against it. They cannot prevail because on the side
of the people is the Lord." Now he was
fighting not George Peek and Hugh Johnson and Harold Ickes. He was
fighting the devil and the bad angels.
And he had on his side the lord, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the good
angels YD the Democrats and the CIO and,
in good time, he would be joined by Joe Stalin and Glen Taylor, the
singing Senator from Idaho. He would
begin making world blueprints YD filling all the continents with TVAs,
globeYDcircling sixYDlane highways, world
AAAs, World Recovery Administrations, World Parliaments and International
Policemen. This was the man chosen for Vice President by Roosevelt who had warned
that his health was not too good
and who forced this strange bird upon his party in the face of a storm
of angry protest. . One of Roosevelt's early
acts in foreign affairs was to recognize Soviet Russia. Three months
later YD February 28, 1934 YD Elliott went into a
deal with Anthony Fokker to sell the Soviet government 50 military
planes for a price which would leave a
commission of half a million dollars for Elliott and the same for Fokker
It is estimated that she has received during the 15 years
since she entered the White House at least three million dollars YD
which is not very bad for a lady who had no
earning power whatever before she moved her desk into the Executive
Mansion, a lady whose husband spent a
good deal of time denouncing the greed of men who made less for directing
some of the greatest enterprises in
America.17 Nevertheless, in spite of these defiances of all the amenities, all
the laws imposed by decency, all the traditional
proprieties and all that body of rules which highYDminded people impose
upon themselves, the Roosevelt family,
through a carefully cultivated propaganda technique not unlike that
which is applied to the sale of quack
medicines, imposed upon the American people the belief that they were
probably the most highYDminded beings
that ever lived in the White House. Behind this curtain of moral grandeur
they were able to carry on in the field
of public policy the most incredible programs which our people, unaccustomed
to this sort of thing, accepted
because they believed these plans came out of the minds of very noble
and righteous beings. Why did the President permit his wife to carry on in this fantastic
manner and why did the Democratic leaders
allow her to do it without protest? ou may be sure that whenever you
behold a phenomenon of this character
there is a reason for it. The reason for it in this case was that Mrs.
Roosevelt was performing an important
service to her husband's political plans.
There were never enough people in the country belonging to the more
or less orthodox
Democratic fold to elect Mr. Roosevelt. It was necessary for him to
get the support of groups outside this
Democratic fold. In the election of 1944,
Governor Dewey got nearly half a million votes more on the Republican
ticket than Roosevelt got on the
Democratic ticket, but Roosevelt was the candidate of two other parties
YD the American Labor Party of the
Communists and the Liberal Party which was a collection of parlor pinks,
technocrats, pious fascists and
American nonYDStalinist Communists. These two parties gave him over
800,000 votes and it was this that made
up his majority in New ork. The same thing was true in Illinois, in
New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts,
and other large industrial states, although the fact was not so obvious
because the radicals operated inside the
Democratic party where they could not be so easily identified. It was in this field that Mrs. Roosevelt performed her indispensable
services to the President. It was she who
fraternized with the Reds and the pinks, with the RedYDfascists and
the technocrats and the crackpot fringe
generally, gave them a sense of association with the White House, invited
their leaders and their pets to the
White House and to her apartment in New ork, went to their meetings,
endorsed their numerous front
Finally in 1899 when she was 15 years old she was sent to a school
called Allenwood, outside of London. It
was a French school kept by an old pedagogist named Madame Souvestre
who has taught Eleanor's aunt in
Paris before the FrancoYDPrussian war After Roosevelt was stricken with infantile paralysis in 1921, she
suddenly found herself for the first time in her
life in a position approaching power on her own feet. While she, with
her rather stern sense of formal
responsibility, made every effort to bring about her husband's recovery,
she also saw the necessity of keeping
alive his interests in public affairs and his contacts and she set
herself about that job. She had already fallen
into acquaintance with leftYDwing labor agitators and she brought these
people as frequently as she could to her
imprisoned husband where they proceeded to work upon a mind practically
empty so far as labor and economic
problems were concerned. The moment a person of Mrs. Roosevelt's type
exposes herself to these infections,
the word gets around radical circles, whose denizens are quick to see
the possibilities in an instrument of this
kind. During Roosevelt's term in Albany she was extensively cultivated
by these groups, so that when she
went to Washington in 1933 they had easy and friendly access to her.
I think it must be said for her that at this point YD in 1933 YD the
country, including its public men, were not too well
informed about the peculiar perils involved in Red propaganda activities.
The Reds seized upon three or four
very popular American democratic cults YD (1) freedom of speech, (2)
the defense of the downtrodden laborer YD
the forgotten man, (3) the succor of the poor. They also began to penetrate
the colleges in both the teaching
staffs and the student bodies through their various front organizations
dominated by Reds. The first attempt to
expose these designs was made by the House Committee on UnYDAmerican
Activities. The attacks upon Martin
Dies and the Dies Committee, as it was known, were engineered and carried
out almost entirely by the
Communist Party. But the Communist Party itself was powerless to do
anything effective and it used some of
the most powerful and prominent persons in the country to do its dirty

. Here
was the wife of the President of the United States, a separate department
of the government, using the White
House as a lobbying ground for a crowd of young Commies and Pinkies
against a committee of Congress.19 At this very moment, Joe Lash was living in the
White House as Mrs. Roosevelt's guest, while Joe Cadden and Abbot Simon
were occasional boarders there.
. Joe Lash had been the leader of the
movement in the American Student Union. Lash worked in collaboration
with the Communist Party. After this,
the American Student Union became a mere tool of the Red organization
in America. the assembled
young philosophers gave the President and Mrs. Roosevelt a hearty Bronx
cheer. And now, of course, Mrs.
Roosevelt felt they were Communists, although she had rejected all
of the overwhelming evidence before that.
Booing the President suddenly turned them into Communists. . A member of Congress, and
ardent New Dealer, visited the White House one morning. While there
he saw Abbot Simon of the national
board of the American outh Congress, come out of one of the bedrooms.
He couldn't believe his eyes. He
asked the White House usher if he was mistaken. The usher assured him
he was not, that this little Commie tool
had been occupying that room for two weeks and sleeping in the bed
Lincoln had slept in. These are probably not more than 80,000 or 90,000 in number, if that.
But there are
several hundred thousand, perhaps half a million, men and women in
America, but chiefly in New ork and the
large eastern industrial states, who string along with the Communists
without being members of the party.
The President's father was a sixth generation Roosevelt who played
out decently

person moving very narrowly within

because it had become illustrious by reason of Theodore Roosevelt who
belonged to a
very different branch of the family. On Franklin D. Roosevelt's mother's side there was certainly nothing
distinguished in the blood. Her father was
a crusty old China Sea trader and opium smuggler. The family had much
of its fortune in soft coal mines Roosevelt was born and grew up in the midst of a baronial estate, surrounded
by numerous acres and many
servants and hemmed about with an elaborate seclusion. What sort of
boy he was we do not know, save that
he was carefully guarded from other boys and grew up without that kind
of boyhood association usual in
The only books that really
interested him were books on the Navy, particularly old books such
as appeal to a collector. He did amass a
considerable library in this field. It is to be assumed he read many
of them. But the history of the Navy and its
battles is not the history of the United States or of Europe or of
their tremendous and complex political and
social movements. They never elected anybody. They offered the nomination to young Roosevelt
and he took it reluctantly. But this was an auspicious year for the
New ork Democrats. In 1912, with the Republicans split in the great TaftYDRoosevelt feud,
the Democrats swept the country and
Roosevelt, though in bed throughout the campaign with typhoid, was
reelected State Senator. When Wilson
entered the White House and someone suggested it would be a good idea
to have a Democratic Roosevelt in
the administration, Franklin Roosevelt was offered the post of Assistant
Secretary of the Navy,
When the First World War ended he was
36. Apparently his service in the Department was satisfactory, though
I have never seen anywhere any
authentic evidence about it one way or the other.
Actually he was not very well known and had absolutely no record of
his own to justify the
nomination. But luck dogged his heels. {Luck/good fortune/auscpicious circumstances/ad infinitum - sog}
Then in August, 1921 Roosevelt was stricken with infantile paralysis,
which put an end to his career in politics
for the next seven years. During his Harvard days, shortly after his marriage, he and his bride
took a trip to Europe YD a regular tourist's
wandering from city to city. He had not been in Europe since save twice
when he went as Assistant Secretary
during the war on a naval inspection tour for about a month, and at
the end of the war on another tour in
connection with the demobilization of naval forces in Europe.
et somehow his promotion managers whipped up the myth that he
possessed some kind of intimate and close knowledge of
Life up to this had been
a long succession of gifts from Lady Luck, whose attendance he had
come to think of as a settled and
dependable affair. And she had failed him. The visitation of the terrible
sickness had perhaps effaced from his
character the assumption of superior fortune that made him hold his
head so high
In his efforts at recovery he had gone to Warm
Springs, Ga., and spent several years there. But Warm Springs became the subject of one of the most curious deals
in the nomination of a man to high
he said "one of the reasons he could not stand for governor was because
he had put a great deal
of his personal fortune into Warm Springs, and he felt he should stay
and manage the enterprise so that it
would eventually become a paying proposition."
my telephone message I wish much that I might consider the possibility
of running for governor." Roosevelt
then gave two reasons why he could not: (1) "our own record in New
ork is so clear that you will carry the
state no matter who is nominated" and (2) "My doctors are definite
that the continued improvement in my
condition is dependent on avoidance of a cold climate" and "daily exercise
in Warm Springs during the winter
months." He added: "As I am only 46 years old I owe it to my family
and myself to give the present constant
improvement a chance to continue ... I must therefore with great regret
confirm my decision not to accept the
nomination."31 {Roosevelt trying to 'back out' of his role as schill... -sog}
Mrs. Roosevelt was in Rochester as a member of the Women's Committee
for Al Smith. So were Ed Flynn and
John J. Raskob, recently named chairman of the National Democratic
Committee to manage Al Smith's campaign
for the presidency.
{...but Elanor is in deep. - sog}
But Flynn told Smith that he believed Roosevelt could be induced to
accept, that his health
treatments were not the real reason for his refusal, that the real
reason was the financial obligations he had
outstanding at Warm Springs, that he was facing a heavy personal loss
but that if this could be gotten out of
the way he might yield. Smith told Flynn to tell Roosevelt they would
take care of his financial problem. "I don't
know how the hell we can do it, but we'll do it some way," he said.32
Flynn suggested that the problem be put
up to Raskob. This was done. Smith asked Raskob to telephone Roosevelt.
Raskob thought it over but decided
to talk to Mrs. Roosevelt about it. He asked Mrs. Roosevelt for
her frank opinion. She replied that if her husband were to say his
health would permit him to run then Raskob
could rely on it and that the real reason was the financial problem
at Warm Springs. Everybody got the
impression that Mrs. Roosevelt wanted her husband to run. Raskob then asked him to say frankly
what they amounted to. Roosevelt replied: "Two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars." Raskob then brought the
whole matter to a head by saying: "All right. our nomination is important
in New ork State. I am in this fight
to get rid of Prohibition which I believe to be a terrible social curse
and I think the only way to do it is to elect
Al Smith. I am willing therefore to underwrite the whole sum of $250,000.
ou can take the nomination and
forget about these obligations. ou can have a fundYDraising effort
and if it falls short of the total I will make up
the difference." Roosevelt was a little flabbergasted at the offer.
{Elanor was not? - sog}
Roosevelt was built by propaganda, before the war on a small scale
and after the war upon an incredible scale,
into a wholly fictitious character YD a great magnanimous lover of the
world, a mighty statesman before whom
lesser rulers bowed in humility, a great thinker, a great orator YD
one of the greatest in history YD an enemy of evil
in all its forms. In his first administration someone was responsible for a very effective
job of selling Roosevelt
to the public. But over and above this some cunning techniques were industriously
used to
enhance the picture. For instance, Mrs. Roosevelt took over the job
of buttering the press and radio reporters
and commentators. They were hailed up to Hyde Park for hamburger and
hot dog picnics. They went swimming
in the pool with the Great Man. They were invited to the White House.
And, not to be overlooked, it was the
simplest thing in the world for them to find jobs in the New Deal for
the members of their families. *** sog ***
The most powerful propaganda agencies yet conceived
by mankind are the radio and the moving pictures. Practically all of
the radio networks and all of the moving
picture companies moved into the great task of pouring upon the minds
of the American people daily YD indeed
hourly, ceaselessly YD the story of the greatest American who ever lived,
breathing fire and destruction against
his critics who were effectually silenced, while filling the pockets
of the people with billions of dollars of war
money. The radio was busy not only with commentators and news reporters,
but with crooners, actors, screen
stars, soap opera, comedians, fan dancers, monologists, putting over
on the American mind not only the
greatness of our Leader but the infamy of his critics, the nobility
of his glamorous objectives and the sinister
nature of the scurvy plots of his political enemies. The people were
sold first the proposition that Franklin D.
Roosevelt was the only man who could keep us out of war; second that
he was the only man who could fight
successfully the war which he alone could keep us out of; and finally
that he was the only man who was
capable of facing such leaders as Churchill and Stalin on equal terms
and above all the only man who could
cope successfully with the ruthless Stalin in the arrangements for
the postYDwar world. *** sog ***
The ordinary man did not realize that Hitler and Mussolini were made
to seem as brave, as strong, as wise and
noble to the people of Germany and Italy as Roosevelt was seen here.
Hitler was not pictured to the people of
Germany as he was presented here. He was exhibited in noble proportions
and with most of those heroic
virtues which were attributed to Roosevelt here and to Mussolini in
Italy and, of course, to Stalin in Russia. I
do not compare Roosevelt to Hitler. I merely insist that the picture
of Roosevelt sold to our people and which
still lingers upon the screen of their imaginations was an utterly
false picture, was the work of false propaganda
and that, among the evils against which America must protect herself
one of the most destructive is the evil of
modern propaganda techniques applied to the problem of government.
{Eugenics was in vogue here, as well as Germany, and would have formed
science of the future *immediately* if Hitler had not been linked to

was really nothing complex about Roosevelt. He was of a wellYDknown
type found in every city and state in
political life. He is the wellYDborn, rich gentleman with a taste for
public life, its importance and honors, who finds
for himself a post in the most corrupt political machines, utters in
campaigns and interviews the most pious
platitudes about public virtue while getting his own dividends out
of public corruption one way or another. e NRA Act
provided an appropriation of $3,300,000,000 which the President was
given to be spent for relief and recovery at
his own discretion. He now had in his hands a sum of money equal to
as much as the government had spent in
ten years outside the ordinary expenses of government. He decided how
it should be spent and where. If a
congressman or senator wanted an appropriation for his district, instead
of introducing a bill in Congress, he
went up to the White House with his hat in his hands and asked the
President for it. All over the country,
states, cities, counties, business organizations, institutions of all
sorts wanted projects of all kinds. Instead of
going to Congress they went to the President. After that congressmen
had to play along with the President or
they got very little or nothing for their districts. This was the secret
of the President's power, but it was also a
tremendous blow at a very fundamental principle of our government which
is designed to preserve the
independence of the Congress from the Executive. In the same way, blankYDcheck legislation led to the subservience of
Congress and the rise of the bureaucracy.
Under our traditional system, Congress alone could pass laws. The executive
bureau merely enforced the law.
But now Congress began to pass laws that created large bureaus and
empowered those bureaus to make
"regulations" or "directives" within a wide area of authority. Under
a law like that the bureau became a
quasiYDlegislative body authorized by Congress to make regulations which
had the effect of law. This practice
grew until Washington was filled with a vast array of bureaus that
were making laws, enforcing them and
actually interpreting them through courts set up within the bureaus,
literally abolishing on a large scale within
that area the distinction between executive, legislative and judicial
processes. Many of these bureaus were never even authorized by Congress. Even
the Comptroller General of the United
States, who audits the government's accounts, declared he had never
heard of some of them. They were
created by a new method which Roosevelt exploited. Instead of asking
Congress to pass a law, set up a bureau
and appropriate money, the President merely named a group of men who
were authorized by him to organize a
corporation under the laws of the states. This done, there was a government
corporation instead of a bureau
and a group of corporation directors instead of commissioners. The
Reconstruction Finance Corporation was
given a blanket appropriation by Congress and authority to borrow money.
It borrowed twenty or more billions.
The RFC would buy the stock of a new corporation and lend it money
YD ten, fifty or a hundred million, billions in
some cases. Thus the President bypassed Congress and the Constitution
and engaged in activities as
completely unconstitutional as the imagination can conceive, such as
operating business enterprises in Mexico
and Canada. By means of the blankYDcheck appropriations, the blankYDcheck
legislation and the government
corporation, there is no power forbidden to the government by the Constitution
which it cannot successfully
seize. And if these techniques are permitted to continue the Constitution
will be destroyed and our system of
government changed utterly without a vote of the people or any amendment
to the Constitution. Roosevelt by
his various hit or miss experiments all designed to get power into
his hands, prepared a perfect blueprint for
some future dictator of the modern school to usurp without very much
difficulty all the powers he needs to
operate a firstYDclass despotism in America. Having changed the Neutrality Act, given a million army rifles to England
and increased the army to 1,500,000,
the President took the next step YD he handed over to Britain 50 destroyers
belonging to the American navy
without authority of Congress. Those men and women who formed the various
committees to induce this
country to go into the war approved these moves. They were honest about
it and logical, because they were
saying openly we should give every aid, even at the risk of war. But
the President was saying he was opposed
to going to war and that he was doing these things to stay out of war.
I do not here criticize his doing these
things. I criticize the reason he gave, which was the very opposite
of the truth. At the time he did these things,
83 per cent of the people month after month were registering their
opposition to getting in the war. After the 1940 election, in fact early in 1941, the President's next
decision was the LendYDLease proposal. Senator
Burton K. Wheeler declared that this was a measure to enable the President
to fight an undeclared war on
The truth is that the President had made up his mind to go into the
war as early as October, 1940. To believe
differently is to write him, our naval chiefs of staff and all our
high military and naval officers down as fools. The answer must be that Roosevelt lied to the people for their own
good. And if
Roosevelt had the right to do this, to whom is the right denied? At
what point are we to cease to demand that
our leaders deal honestly and truthfully with us? There must be a thorough philosophical inquiry into the limits within
which this convenient discursive weapon
can be used. It has been generally supposed that our diplomats are
free to lie to foreign diplomats, also that in
war and on the way into war we are free to lie ad libitum to the enemy.
The right of the President YD and maybe
certain lesser dignitaries YD to lie to our own people and, perhaps,
in certain defined situations, to each other
ought to be explored and settled. Thus it may be used impartially by
the representatives of all parties. It does
not seem fair to limit the right of lying only to good and truthful
men. (TruthMonger Lives!!! - sog}
President and the
Prime Minister issued what they called a Joint Declaration. The most
important parts of that document were the
first three paragraphs: "First, their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or otherwise.
"Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord
with the freely expressed desires of the
peoples concerned. "Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of
government under which they will live and
they wish to see sovereign rights and selfYDgovernment restored to those
who have been forcibly deprived of
them."

There was no reason for meeting at sea save
the purely spectacular features which Roosevelt always loved. The dramatic
effect of the meeting was very
great. It made a thunderous radio story and massive headlines. But,
as was so characteristic of Roosevelt, the
great declaration of principles was a mere incident of the meeting.
The purpose was wholly military. Three weeks after Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt sent for all the representatives
in America of these occupied
countries and said to them: "Be assured, gentlemen, that the restoration of the countries occupied
by Germany and suffering under the
Axis yoke is my greatest concern, which is shared in like degree by
Mr. Churchill. We promise that all will be
done to insure the independence of these countries." Churchill was present. He turned to the Polish Ambassador and said:
"We will never forget what glorious Poland has done and is doing nor
what heroic Greece and Holland have
done in this war. I hope I need not add that Great Britain has set
herself the aim of restoring full independence
and freedom to the nations that have been overrun by Hitler."
These reassurances were to be repeated many times with varying oratorical
flourishes. And as for the "Atlantic
Charter," which was nothing more than a screen to hide what had actually
been done at Placentia Bay, a
handsome copy of it was made, bearing the names of Churchill and Roosevelt,
and placed on exhibition in the
National Museum in Washington, where crowds viewed it with reverence
as one of the great documents of
history. . On November 27, just ten
days before the attack, the President told Secretary Stimson, who wrote
it in his diary, that our course was to
maneuver the Japanese into attacking us. This would put us into the
war and solve his problem.
The Board of Economic Warfare was created to control the export of
all materials seeking private
export and to look after the procurement of all materials essential
to the war effort, except arms and munitions.
Vice President Wallace was named chairman of the Board of Economic
Warfare (BEW). There was an element of "cloak and dagger" in this institution. It
was at war with Hitler and Hirohito in the
markets of the world. It bought things we needed. But it also bought,
where necessary, things we did not need
in order to preclude the enemy getting them. This was called "preclusive"
buying. It issued thousands of
export licenses every day. It was quite a bureau and it bulged with
bureaucrats. At the top, next to Wallace,
was a somewhat cheaper edition of Wallace YD an authentic New Deal bureaucrat,
if there ever was one. He was
Milo Perkins, executive director. Perkins was a man with a soul YD one of
those souls that keeps making a lot of noise inside his body. He went
in for art and music and finally
Theosophy. The New Republic said of him that "for nine years at nine
every Sunday morning, he donned his
priestly robes, took along his sons and acolytes and preached to a
congregation of fifty people."
By 1943 the BEW had 200 economic commandos in the field fighting Hitler
in the market places of the world and
around 3,000 in Washington directing their weird operations
Although this outfit spent $1,200,000,000, no law ever authorized it,
and the Senate never confirmed the
appointment of Wallace or Perkins. The President "grabbed the torch"
and created it by edict.
Of course, a great legion of economic soldiers had to have a chief
economist. How they picked him I do not
know. But these two great geopolitical warriors YD Wallace and Perkins
YD came up with a gentleman named Dr.
Maurice Parmalee, born in Constantinople. Parmalee wrote another book labeled "Bolshevism, Fascism and the Liberal
Democratic State." In this
he renders it feasible to introduce a planned social economy much more
rapidly than has been the case in the
U.S.S.R. ...The superficial paraphernalia of capitalism can be dispensed
with more quickly than in the Soviet
Union." But the doctor had strayed into much lighter fields of literature.
He had also written a book called
"Nudism in Modern Life" which is secluded in the obscene section of
the Library of Congress. In it the doctor
revealed his interest in a science called Gymnosophy, a cult of the
old gymnosophists who it seems were
ancient Hindu hermit philosophers who went around with little or no
clothing. "these gymnosophist nudist colonies furnish excellent opportunities
for experiments
along socialist lines ... Customary nudity is impossible under existing
undemocratic, social and economic and
political organization." A new chief economist was brought in YD Dr. John Bovingdon.
Bovingdon was no fool. He went to Harvard and graduated with honors,
which is more than Mr. Roosevelt did.
But he, too, was one of those free spirits of the wandering winds who
had managed to live for a while in the
Orient, three years in Europe and England, two years in Russia and
for smaller terms in 22 other countries. His
Harvard class reunion book said he "engaged in art activities, painting
on fabrics, poetry, dancing, acting,
consultant on the Moscow Art Theater, oneYDman commercial monodrama
programs, weaving, sandalYDmaking"
and so on. In 1931 the police in Los Angeles raided a Red pageant for
a Lenin Memorial which Bovingdon was
staging. The experience shook Mr. Bovingdon terribly and he went to
Russia. He got a job in Moscow as a
director of the International Theatre. He worked as a journalist in
the world of free Russian speech, wrote radio
scripts and plays. He decided to return to the United States to make
us understand Russia. In January, 1938, he appeared in Long Beach,
California, at the town's first "Communist Party celebration on the
14th anniversary of Lenin's death." By what curious movement of the stars did these weird ideological brothers
turn up on posts of the
greatest importance in the councils of the New Deal? As fast as one
was pushed out another moved in. It could
not be by chance, since this happened in practically every important

These two strange birds were not isolated cases. The UnYDAmerican Activities
Committee gave Wallace a list of
35 Communists in the BEW. That information was merely brushed aside
with some insulting smear against the
Committee. It mattered not what the New Dealer touched, it became a torch to be
grabbed, it became an instrument for use
in his adventures in social engineering, and after June, 1941 when
Hitler turned on his partner Stalin, these
bureaus became roosting places for droves of Communist termites who
utilized their positions as far as they
dared to advance the interests of Soviet Russia and to help "dispense
with the superficial paraphernalia of
capitalism" in this country under cover of the war. By no means a basically bad person, he was
congenitally incapable of resisting the destructive personal effects

They put their busy fingers into everything. They dictated women's
styles, the shapes of women's stockings;
they told butchers how to carve a roast; they limited the length of
Santa Claus' whiskers in department stores. At one time there was an almost complete breakdown of food distribution
throughout the United States. The
paper work required of an ordinary small merchant was so extensive
that it was practically impossible to comply
These rules and regulations became so irksome that people ignored them.

little profits for honest men because the government YD and rightly
YD during the war drained away in drastic taxes
most of the profits. In the financing and supervision of the war effort from
Washington practically every fiscal crime was committed. And the plain
evidence of that is before us in the bill
for the war. Few realize how vast it was. For the mind, even of the
trained financier, begins to lose its capacity
for proportion after the figures pass beyond the limit of understandable
billions. The war cost I reckon at 363
billion dollars. Chapter Eight - The Thought Police
If there is one department of human struggle which the radical revolutionist
understands and loves it is the war
that is waged on the mass mind; the war that is carried on with poisons
distilled in the mind to produce bias
and hatred. It would be strange indeed if we did not find some of the
practitioners of this dark art from New
ork and some of the offYDscourings of Europe's battered revolutionary
emigres numerously entrenched in that
thoroughly unYDAmerican institution during the war which was known as
the OWI YD the Office of War
Information. It began with a thing called the Office of Facts and Figures.
a drove of writers and journalists whose souls were enlisted in the
great crusade to bring on the Brave
New World of the Future. It was in fact an agency for selling Roosevelt's
Third New Deal and Roosevelt
himself to the people under the guise of "maintaining public morale"
and conducting "psychological warfare."
, OWI spent $68,000,000 and had 5,561
agents scattered all over the world.
But OWI had other tasks than selling America to the Arabs. It was also
busy selling Russia to the Americans.
The chief of the Foreign Language Section of OWI was a young gentleman
28 years old who had spent his
entire life on New ork's East Side, who spoke no foreign language
and yet had the decision on whether news
should be released to Europe or not. Anybody who disagreed with his
high admiration for our Soviet ally was
labeled a fascist. There was another child wonder YD 23 years old YD
who was the Russian expert of the OWI and
who saw to it that nothing went out that was displeasing to the objectives
of our noble ally YD including
grabbing ugoslavia. OWI's broadcasts to Poland ended not with the
Polish national anthem but with a song
adopted by the Polish emigres in Moscow who were known as Stalin's
"Committee of Liberation." The expert in
charge of the Polish section was actually born in Poland, but left
there and spent the rest of his life in France
where he was notorious as a Communist. He fraternized with the Vichy
government while Hitler and Stalin were
pals, but when Hitler invaded Russia he came to America and quickly
became OWI's expert in explaining
American democracy to the people of Poland.51 The deputy director of the Pacific and Far Eastern Area was a British
subject until he got a government job in
Washington in 1942. While running this important bureau for OWI, he
wrote a play which was produced at
Hunter College. Burton Rascoe, reviewing it, said: "Its most conspicuous
purpose is to idealize the Red Army
in China, to defame the Chungking government under Chiang KaiYDshek
and to ridicule the political, social and
educational ideas of the vast majority of the American people."52 The men, material, cable and wireless time used up by OWI were immense.
It ran 350 daily radio programs and
had a daily cableYDwireless output of 100,000 words. It was the world's
largest pamphlet and magazine publisher
and a big movie producer, sending shorts to every country in the world.
It sent out 3,500 transcribed
recordings a month and turned out 50 movie shorts a year. The content
of most of this material was pure drivel.
All of this work was not just naive. OWI printed 2,500,000 pamphlets
called "The Negro in the War,"54 with
pictures of Mr. and Mrs. Roosevelt, the Negroes' friends, in preparation
for the fourthYDterm campaign. It printed
a handsome volume called "Handbook of the United States"55 and gave
a British firm the right to publish it.
This gave a history of America, with the story from Leif Ericson's
discovery up to 1932 in four and oneYDhalf
pages. The rest of the history was devoted to Roosevelt and his New
Deal. This was in 1944 and a national
election was coming and England was jammed with American soldiers who
could vote. It had a department that supplied the pulp paper magazines with direction
and suggestions on how to slant
mystery and love stories. Western story writers were told how to emphasize
the heroism of our allies YD you
know which one. Writers were told to cast their soap operas with silent,
dogged Britons, faithful Chinese and
honest Latins. They must portray Japanese as having set out to seize
our Western seaboard and the sly and
treacherous characteristics of the Jap must be contrasted with the
faithfulness of the Chinese. They suggested
that Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu be turned into a Jap instead of a Chinese.
When the war began the government, recognizing the need for protecting
our military operations from leaks
through careless or uninformed press reporting, organized the Office
of Censorship headed by Byron Price, an
able official of the Associated Press. To this bureau was given the
power to monitor all communications. It set
up a censorship organization which all publishers and broadcasters
voluntarily cooperated with. It worked
admirably and Mr. Price won the unstinted approval of the press for
his capable and tactful, yet firm, handling
of this difficult problem. No other government agency had any authority
whatever to engage in this activity.
And it was never intended that anybody should have the power to attempt
to interfere with the rights of
citizens to discuss with freedom all political questions, subject only
to the obligation not to divulge information
that would aid the enemy or defeat our military operations. Nevertheless, the OWI and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) took
upon themselves the power to
carry on the most extensive propaganda among, and the most dangerous
interference with, the
foreignYDlanguage broadcasting stations. Of course the ordinary American
official was hardly aware of the
opportunities this kind of thing gave to those who had political or
ideological axes to grind. It was important to see that nothing subversive and nothing that would
adversely affect the war effort
was used. And for this purpose the Office of Censorship was admirably
equipped and managed. But the FCC
decided that it would take a hand, not merely in monitoring the stations
but in literally directing and controlling
them. The OWI similarly arrived at the same conclusion. It also set
up a division for dealing with the problems
of the foreignYDborn through radio. Mr. Eugene L. Garey, chief counsel of the Congressional Select Committee
Investigating the FCC, speaking of
these conditions said: "From the record thus far made it appears that, in one foreign language
broadcasting station in New ork City,
the program director, the announcer, the script writer, the censor,
and the monitor of the ItalianYDlanguage
programs are all aliens or persons owing their positions to the Office
of War Information, with the approval of
the FCC. "The situation thus portrayed is not peculiar to this single station,
or to this one city. Information in our
possession indicates that the same situation prevails generally in
the foreign language stations throughout the
country. Every such key position in each of the three radio stations
presently under investigation are found to
be similarly staffed. These staffs select the news, edit the script,
and announce the program. The program, in
turn, is censored by them, monitored by them, and is presented under
the direction of a program director of
similar character. "From these apparently unrelated facts the picture must be further
developed. "OWI had the men and the material. It had the proper dye to color the
news. It also had the desire to select and
censor the news. What it lacked was the power, or perhaps more accurately
stated, even the color of power, to
carry their designs into effect. Hence the need to enlist the Federal
Communications Commission in its purpose.
"True it is that the Federal Communications Commission had no such
lawful power, but the Federal
Communications Commission did have the power to license and hence the
power to compel obedience to its
directions. The record now shows their unlawful use of this power.
"Working together in a common purpose, the Federal Communications Commission
and the Office of War
Information have accomplished a result that compels pause YD and presents
the solemn question of 'Whither are
we going?' "A division called the War Problems Division was created by the Federal
Communications Commission, and a
staff of attorneys began to function. "This division was not a regulatory body. It was not formed to instruct,
or supervise, or to correct. It was
formed for the avowed purpose of unlawfully liquidating all of the
radio personnel in the foreignYDlanguage field
that did not meet with its favor. A real gestapo was created and a
lawless enterprise was launched. "It is suggested that we accept this unlawful situation as a benevolent
expedient of the moment, but no such
purpose as we find here disclosed, however benevolently cloaked, can
justify the practices we find. All tyranny
begins under the guise of benevolence. "The voices of these aliens go into our homes, and the unwary are led
to believe that they speak with authority
and official approval. They even censor our Christmas and Easter religious
programs, and tell us what music we
may hear. The FCC is alarmed about whether we will react properly to
news furnished by our national news
agencies. Apparently we can still read the news in our press, but we
can only hear what these aliens permit us
to. What next medium of communications will receive the benevolent
attention of these misguided zealots?
Obviously, the press. "These interpreters of our national policy YD these slanters of our
news YD these destroyers of free speech YD are
alien in birth, alien in education, alien in training and in thought.
"And still these are the people who are permitted to mold our thoughts
YD to tell us what America's war aims and
purposes are. These people are in position to color, to delete, or
to slant, as they see fit, in accordance with
their own peculiar alien views and ideologies. "Persons are being accused of being proYDfascist, and that without proof
and without trial. Persons suspected of
being proYDfascist, and without proof, have been removed from the air
and replaced by wearers of the Black Shirt
... "If the radio can thus be controlled in August, 1943, there is nothing
to prevent the same control from slanting
our political news and nothing to prevent the coloring of our war aims
and purposes when peace comes."57 In the presence of a government which had enlarged its power over the
lives and the thoughts and opinions of
citizens and which did not hesitate to use that power, the whole citizenry
was intimidated. Editors, writers,
commentators were intimidated. Men whose opinions did not conform to
the reigning philosophy were driven
from the air, from magazines and newspapers. While American citizens
who were moved by a deep and
unselfish devotion to the ideals of this Republic YD however wrongYDheaded
that may be in the light of the new
modes of "freedom" YD were forced into silence, the most blatant and
disruptive revolutionary lovers of the
systems of both fascism and Communism and that illegitimate offspring
of both YD Red fascism YD were lording it
over our minds. All this was possible for one reason and one reason only YD because
the President of the United States
countenanced these things, encouraged them and in many cases sponsored
them, not because he was a
Communist or fascist or held definitely to any political system, but
because at the moment they contributed to
his own ambitions. When a nation is at war, its leaders are compelled by the necessities
of practical administration to use every
means at hand to sell the war to the people who must fight it and pay
for it. As part of that job it is usual to
include the leader himself in the package. He is therefore portrayed
in heroic proportions and colors in order to
command for his leadership the fullest measure of unity. War, as we
have seen, puts into the hands of a leader
control over the instruments of propaganda and opinion on an everYDincreasing
scale. In our day the press, the
radio, the movies, even the schoolroom and the pulpit are mobilized
to justify the war, to magnify the leader and
to intimidate his critics. The citizen who is hardy enough to question
the official version of the leader and his
policies may find himself labeled as a public enemy or even as a traitor.
Hence as the war proceeds, amidst all
the trappings which the art of theater can contribute, it is possible
to build up a vast fraud, with an
everYDmounting torrent of false news, false pictures, false eulogies
and false history. After every war many years
are required to reduce its great figures to their just proportions
and to bring the whole pretentious legend back
into focus with truth. the public was treated to the royal spectacles off the coast
of Newfoundland aboard the Augusta, at Quebec, Casablanca, Moscow,
Cairo, Teheran and finally at alta.
Eloquent communiques pretended to inform the people of what had been
agreed on.
We now know that these communiques told us little of what had happened;
that the whole story lay, for long,
behind a great curtain of secrecy; that much YD though not all YD has
now been painfully brought to light and that
what stands revealed is a story very different from that heroic chronicle
of triumphs with which we were regaled
at the time. As Roosevelt saw it, Stalin was his great target. He began by completely
deceiving himself about Stalin. First of
all, he decided he must cultivate Stalin's good will and to do this
he convinced himself he must sell Stalin to our
people. Accordingly the instruments of propaganda which he could influence
YD the radio and the movies and to
a considerable degree, the press YD were set to work upon the great
task. Under the influence of this benevolent atmosphere the Reds in New ork
and their compliant dupes, the
fellowYDtravelers, swarmed into Washington and presently were sitting
in positions of power or influence in the
policyYDmaking sections of the government. Joe Davies had been induced
to go to Moscow, wrote his notorious
"Mission to Moscow," a jumble of obvious fictions which were later
transferred to the screen several times
exaggerated and shot into millions of minds in movie houses. We know now from the election returns
of 1944 that the Reds had in their hands enough support to have turned
the tide against Roosevelt. In New
ork State, for instance, Roosevelt won its 47 electoral votes by a
majority of 317,000. But he got 825,000 votes
from the Red American Labor Party dominated by the Communists, which
had also nominated him, and the
American Liberal Party made up of the pinks, which also nominated him.
Without these votes he would have
lost the state. He dared not defy these two powerful groups. On the
other hand, he was in a very deep hole
with the votes of the Polish, Lithuanian, Serbian and other Baltic
and Balkan peoples living in America who
were citizens. He had betrayed the Poles, the Serbs and the Baltic
peoples. But he had managed to keep it dark.
Somehow he must avoid any publication of the truth until after the
election. They made a decision at Quebec which has up to this moment paralyzed
utterly the
making of a stable peace in Europe and is pregnant with consequences
so terrible for the future that the mind
draws away from them in consternation.
Secretary Hull said: "This was a plan of blind vengeance ... It failed
to see that in striking at Germany it was
striking at all Europe." The proposals "that the mines be ruined was
almost breathtaking in its implications for
all Europe."
Beyond all this, of course, was our dignity as a civilized
people. The barbarians could sweep into enemy countries and ravage
their fields, burn their cities and murder
their leaders. This is a job from which a civilized people must recoil
if they have not lost their souls.
Roosevelt agreed to the Morgenthau Plan to destroy German industry
and to reduce Germany to a country
primarily agricultural and pastoral. Secretaries Hull and Stimson did
not know anything about it until four days
after it was done. e the contents of the Morgenthau Plan leaked to the papers and
Roosevelt became alarmed at the violence of the reaction, a fine evidence
of the fundamentally decent nature of
the majority of Americans. In the end the President was persuaded to get out of this appalling
agreement so far as destroying the mines of
the Ruhr were concerned. But Stimson declares "the same attitude remained,"
and the whole world now knows
of the frightful wreckage that was carried on in Germany and the blow
to the economy of all Europe that was
delivered in the name of "blind vengeance" and immortal hatred. The administration was now the hopeless prisoner of these demanding
and ruthless radical labor
leaders, who had shown their ability to elect or defeat the Democratic
party, who had filled all the departments
and bureaus with their agents and who had insinuated their experts
into the CIO labor unions and their
propagandists into the radio, the movies and all the great instruments
of communication and opinion YD a fact
which Mr. Roosevelt's successors would have to face when the war ended.
What had become of the Atlantic Charter? On December 20, 1944, the
President at a press conference was
asked about the Charter which he and Churchill had signed. His reply
literally bowled over the correspondents.
There was not and never had been a complete Atlantic Charter signed
by him and Churchill, he replied. Then
where is the Charter now, he was asked. He replied: "There wasn't any
copy of the Atlantic Charter so far as I
know." It was just a press release. It was scribbled on a piece of
paper by him and Churchill and Sumner Welles
and Sir Alexander Cadogan. It was just handed to the radio operator
aboard the British and American warships
to put on the air as a news release. Further inquiry revealed that
Stephen Early had handed it out on his own
with the signatures of Churchill and Roosevelt attached. And over on
the wall of the National Museum in
Washington, beautifully framed and illuminated after the manner of
an ancient document YD like Magna Carta or
the Declaration of Independence YD was the great Atlantic Charter itself,
with the signatures of Roosevelt and
Churchill. Daily visitors stood before it as before some great historic
document. John O'Donnell, of the New
ork Daily News, asked the curator where he got it. He answered that
it came from the Office of War
Information. They had "loaned" the precious document to the National
Museum. By inquiry at the OWI YD that
prolific fountain of phony news YD O'Donnell learned that OWI had gotten
it up and affixed the names of
Roosevelt and Churchill. They had printed 240,000 copies of it. O'Donnell
went back to the Museum with this
information. And lo! the great Charter was gone. An attendant told
him it had been ordered off the wall twenty
minutes before. Thus ended the story of this wretched fraud. The fake
document which was never signed and
was nothing more than a publicity stunt to conceal the real purposes
of the Atlantic meeting had been slain by
its chief sponsor and, of course, all its highYDsounding professions,
after Teheran, had become as sounding
brass or a tinkling cymbal. On January 20, 1945, Roosevelt was sworn in as President of the United
States for a fourth term. Three days
later he left Norfolk on the heavy cruiser Quincy for what was to be
his last act in the hapless drama of peace.

The Polish question was "settled." The formal proposal to hand over
eastern Poland YD east of the Curzon line YD
was made by Roosevelt himself.102 As to western Poland, Stalin already
had a government there named by him
and composed of Communists representing no one but Stalin himself.
Russia wanted the amount to be 20 billion dollars of which she would
take half. It
was agreed that labor might be taken as a possible source of reparations.
This was just a diplomatic way of
authorizing the seizure of human beings to work as slaves after the
war ended and is the basis of that dreadful
crime perpetrated after hostilities ceased to which the President of
the United States agreed.
As the conference ended, Roosevelt remained an extra day because Stalin
wanted to talk with him. He did so
alone. What he wanted settled was "the political aspects of Russia's
participation" in the Pacific. This he was
able to do very quickly and to his complete satisfaction. In return
for Russian participation in the Pacific,
Roosevelt agreed that the Kuriles Islands would be handed to Russia,
who would also get Sakhalin Island,
internationalization of the Port of Darien, the lease of Port Arthur
as a naval base and joint operation with China
of the Eastern and Southern Manchurian railroads. And Roosevelt promised
to use his influence with Chiang
to force him to agree. This secret agreement, like the one supporting
the use of slave labor, was not made
public and was concealed even from Byrnes who was Roosevelt's adviser
at alta. He did not hear of it until
after Mr. Roosevelt's death. Then he saw a reference to it in a Russian
dispatch. By that time he was Secretary
of State. He asked President Truman to have the White House records
searched for this and any other secret
outstanding I.O.U.'s.105 He did
suggest that to avoid criticism at home the United States be given
three votes too. And Stalin agreed. When
Byrnes got back to the United States he found a note from Roosevelt
instructing him not to discuss this
agreement even in private. Later Roosevelt decided not to ask for the
three votes for the United States. Byrnes
says he never discovered the reason.106 On the way home
General Watson, his military secretary, died suddenly of heart disease.
Roosevelt reached Washington the end
of February. On March 1 he appeared before a joint session of Congress.
He told the Congress that "more than
ever before the major allies are closely united," that "the ideal of
lasting peace will become a reality." There was
no hint that the surrender which was now formally announced with respect
to eastern Poland was in fact a
major defeat. The disappearance of the Baltic states and practically
all the Balkans behind Stalin's iron curtain
was not announced in any other terms than as a great forward step in
the liberation of Europe. As for western
Poland, there were heavy overtones of guilt and frustration unintentionally
evident. In two months Roosevelt was dead. Truman became President. Shortly
after, in May, the German Army
surrendered. The fighting was in the West was over. "Silent, mournful, broken Czechoslovakia recedes into the darkness.
has suffered in every respect by her association with the Western democracies."
Chamberlain appeased Hitler
and averted war. Churchill got for England both a war and appeasement.
Stalin had merely to sit tight, to make known
his wishes and Roosevelt laid them in his lap with eager compliance
in the notion that he could thus soften
Stalin. It is all the more incredible when we remember that the things
he was laying in Stalin's lap were the
existence of little nations and the rights of little peoples we had
sworn to defend. And when Truman and
Byrnes went to Potsdam what confronted them was an appalling mess.
Roosevelt not only made agreements secret from the people but secret
from his
closest advisers in the government. He made agreements with Stalin
hostile to the objectives of Churchill and
kept secret from Churchill. He made secret agreements with Chiang KaiYDshek,
secret from both Churchill and
Stalin, and secret agreements in derogation of Chiang KaiYDshek's interests
without his knowledge. And he made
many secret agreements which no one in our State Department knew about
until his death and then learned
about them the hard way, by having them flung in their faces at embarrassing
moments by Molotov. At the end of all this, Russia held in her hands a vast belt of land
running from the Baltic sea in the north to the
Black Sea in the south, comprising eleven nations with a population
of 100 million people. These she held, not
as parts of the Soviet Union, but as puppet states, presided over by
Red Quislings of Stalin's own selection
who represented him and not the people they governed, any more than
Quisling represented the people of
Norway. The truth is that Roosevelt was a dying man when he was elected, that
many of those around him knew it, that
the most elaborate care was exercised to conceal the fact from the
people and that the misgivings of those who
observed it were justified by events, since he died less than three
months after his fourth inauguration. The
progress of that illness and the means employed to deceive the people
must be examined. Rear Admiral Ross T. McIntire, his official physician, felt called
upon to put in a book his formal apologia.
He was a naval officer employed by the people to watch
over the President's health and these statements had the effect of
deceiving the employers of the President and
of the Admiral YD namely the people. What disease Roosevelt suffered from at Hyde Park and later, that produced
such grave consequences, we do
not know save upon the statements of Dr. McIntire. Many other doctors
were called in to examine the patient,
but none of these men has ever made any statements. However, while
the illness seemingly began at Hyde Park
after the return from Teheran, there is at least some evidence that
he was far from sound before that time. Three
men have written about the trip to Cairo and Teheran YD Dr. McIntire,
Mike Reilly, chief of the President's Secret
Service guard, and Elliott Roosevelt. The President went to Cairo by
sea. But he wanted to fly from there to
Teheran. Reilly tells us that Admiral McIntire "did not want to submit
some of the members of the party to the
rigors of high altitude flight" but that "the President was not one
of these members."112 And McIntire
volunteers the information that Roosevelt suffered no discomfort on
high altitude flights and had shown no
signs of anoxemia when flying at altitudes of 10,000 to 12,000 feet.113
ou might suppose from this Roosevelt
was quite a flier. et he had never been in a plane since he flew to
Chicago for his first acceptance speech 11
years before until he made the trip to Casablanca YD his only flight
while President before Teheran. However,
Elliott Roosevelt in his book defeats these yarns. He tells how McIntire
was worried about Father's projected
flight. "I'm serious, Elliott," says McIntire. "I think he could fly
only as far as Basra and then go on by train."
Elliott wanted to know what height his father might fly, to which McIntire
replied: "Nothing over 7500 feet YD and
that's tops."114 Elliott talked to the President's proposed pilot, Major Otis Bryan
who, with Mike Reilly, made an inspection
flight from Teheran to Basra and back and reported that the trip could
be made without going higher than 7000
feet, which, says Elliott, "pleased Father very much."115 Thus McIntire
and Reilly are both caught redYDhanded
misleading their readers. This was before Teheran. Elliott talked to the President's proposed pilot, Major Otis Bryan
who, with Mike Reilly, made an inspection
flight from Teheran to Basra and back and reported that the trip could
be made without going higher than 7000
feet, which, says Elliott, "pleased Father very much."115 Thus McIntire
and Reilly are both caught redYDhanded
misleading their readers. This was before Teheran. Whatever malady struck Roosevelt down at Hyde Park in December and
kept him pretty much out of circulation
until nearly the middle of May, 1944, we know that McIntire at that
time caused a heart specialist from Boston
to be inducted into the service to remain continuously at Roosevelt's
side and that this heart specialist, Dr.
Howard Bruenn, said a year later at Warm Springs that he "never let
Roosevelt out of his sight," which is a
most unusual performance in the case of a patient whose "stout heart
never failed him," as Dr. McIntire puts it
A great mystery surrounded this illness.
. He was dying slowly at first, rapidly later. And at his side as his
chief adviser was
another dying man YD Harry Hopkins. Hopkins had had a portion of his
stomach removed for ulcers and what
was known as a gastroYDenterotomy performed. After this his liver troubled
him and the gall bladder failed to
supply satisfactorily the essential bile necessary to digestion. These two dying men, floating slowly out of life, were deliberately
put into power through a fourthYDterm election by a carefully arranged
deception practiced upon the American
people and upon some, at least, of the party leaders. Here was a crime
committed against a great nation which
had made tremendous sacrifices and against the peace and security of
the world in a moment of the gravest
danger. History will pronounce its verdict upon all who were guilty.
Dr. McIntire was immediately notified of the stroke in
Washington and he, Mrs. Roosevelt and Steve Early left at once by plane
for Warm Springs, arriving there at
11 P.M. They immediately decided to have no autopsy. The body was consigned
to its coffin and orders issued
not to open it. It was taken from Warm Springs next morning at 9 o'clock.
It reached Washington next day YD the
14th YD and after lying for a few hours without ever being opened was
taken that night to Hyde Park for
interment next day. It has been the custom in the past for the remains
of deceased Presidents to lie in state in
the Capitol. This was not done.
Present in the cottage when the President was stricken were the artist,
Schoumantoff, who was painting his portrait, his two cousins, his valet
and several others. The artist, a
Russian, was ordered to leave at once. She took a train without delay
and was not located until two days later
at Locust Valley, L.I.
At St. Helena the British government provided its illustrious
prisoner, Napoleon I, with a physician. He was Dr. Francesco Antomarchi,
a Corsican, who however, did not
seem particularly fond of his fallen countryman and who failed signally
to win Napoleon's confidence. Dr.
Antomarchi persisted to the end in the belief that his royal patient
was not seriously ill. Napoleon convinced
himself that his physician did not know what he was doing and that
the medicines he was prescribing were
actually injuring him. Napoleon watched his chance and when the doctor's
back was turned, handed the mixture
just prepared for him to an aide who swallowed it and was immediately
taken with a violent internal disturbance.
The Emperor denounced Antomarchi as an assassin. Dr. MacLaurin,126
who has written interestingly of this
case, observes that from the symptoms now known to be present and even
in the then state of medical
knowledge at that period, the veriest blockhead would have known that
the Emperor was seriously ill.
Napoleon died shortly after the incident described above of cancer
of the stomach. In this case, instead of
passing up the autopsy, Antomarchi performed one himself in order to
prove that there were no symptoms
present to inform him of the presence of cancer and he wrote a book
upon the subject. He did not restore our economic system to vitality. He
changed it. The system he blundered us into is more like the managed
and bureaucratized, stateYDsupported
system of Germany before World War I than our own traditional order.
Before his regime we lived in a system
which depended for its expansion upon private investment in private
enterprise. Today we live in a system
which depends for its expansion and vitality upon the government. This
is a preYDwar European importation YD
imported at the moment when it had fallen into complete disintegration
in Europe. In America today every
fourth person depends for his livelihood upon employment either directly
by the government or indirectly in
some industry supported by government funds. In this substituted system
the government confiscates by
taxes or borrowings the savings of all the citizens and invests them
in nonYDwealthYDproducing enterprises in
order to create work. Behold the picture of American economy today:
taxes which confiscate the savings of
every citizen, a public debt of 250 billion dollars as against a preYDRoosevelt
debt of 19 billions, a government
budget of 40 billions instead of four before Roosevelt, inflation doubling
the prices and reducing the
lowerYDbracket employed workers to a state of pauperism as bad as that
of the unemployed in the depression,
more people on various kinds of government relief than when we had
11 million unemployed, Americans
trapped in the economic disasters and the political quarrels of every
nation on earth and a system of permanent
militarism closely resembling that we beheld with horror in Europe
for decades, bureaucrats swarming over
every field of life and the President calling for more power, more
priceYDfixing, more regulations and more billions.
Does this look like the traditional American scene? Or does it not
look rather like the system built by Bismarck
in Germany in the last century and imitated by all the lesser Bismarcks
in Europe? He changed our political system with two weapons YD blankYDcheck congressional
appropriations and blankYDcheck congressional legislation. In 1933,
Congress abdicated much of its power when
it put billions into his hands by a blanket appropriation to be spent
at his sweet will and when it passed general
laws, leaving it to him, through great government bureaus of his appointment,
to fill in the details of legislation
He used it to break down the power of
Congress and concentrate it in the hands of the executive. The end
of these two betrayals YD the smashing of
our economic system and the twisting of our political system YD can
only be the Planned Economic State, which,
either in the form of Communism or Fascism, dominates the entire continent
of Europe today. The capitalist
system cannot live under these conditions. The capitalist system cannot
survive a Planned Economy. Such an
economy can be managed only by a dictatorial government capable of
enforcing the directives it issues. The
only result of our present system YD unless we reverse the drift YD must
be the gradual extension of the fascist
sector and the gradual disappearance of the system of free enterprise
under a free representative government. how has it advanced the cause of democracy? We liberated Europe
from Hitler and turned it over to the mercies of a far more terrible
tyrant and actually tried to sell him to the
people as a savior of civilization. Behold Europe! Does one refer to
the wreckage there as liberation and
salvation? Is anyone so naive as to suppose that democracy and free
capitalism have been restored in Europe?
Fascism has departed from Germany, but a hybrid system of socialism
and capitalism in chains has come to
England, which is called social democracy but is on its way to Fascism
with all the controls without which such
a system cannot exist. And in America the price of the war is that
fatal deformity of our own economic and
political system which Roosevelt effected under the impact of the war
necessities. The war rescued him and he seized upon it like a drowning man. By leading
his country into the fringes of the war at first and then deep into
its center all over the world he was able to do
the only things that could save him YD spend incomprehensible billions,
whip up spending in the hot flames of
war hysteria, put every man and his wife and grandparents into the
war mills, while under the pressure of
patriotic inhibitions, he could silence criticism and work up the illusion
of the war leader. Look up the promises he made, not to our own people, but to the Chinese,
to Poland, to
Czechoslovakia, to the Baltic peoples in Lithuania and Latvia and Estonia,
to the Jews out of one side of his
mouth and to the Arabs out of the other side. He broke every promise.
The figure of Roosevelt exhibited before the eyes of our people is
a fiction. There was no such being as that
noble, selfless, hardYDheaded, wise and farseeing combination of philosopher,
philanthropist and warrior which
has been fabricated out of pure propaganda and which a small collection
of dangerous cliques in this country
are using to advance their own evil ends. In June the longYDawaited invasion of the continent was launched. With
this we will not concern ourselves. The
other subject that occupied Roosevelt's mind was his plan to have himself
renominated for a fourth time. The President had lost his head, at least a little. Congress was slipping
away from him. A growing section of his
party, particularly in the Senate, was moving out of that collection
of incongruous elements called the Third
New Deal. It was crawling with Reds and their gullible allies who got
themselves into key positions in all the
bureaus and were talking with great assurance about what they were
going to do with America and the world.
The Communists had all become antiYDfascists and everybody who was against
the Communists was, therefore,
a fascist. A group of organizations financed by undisclosed benefactors
was riding roughshod through the
country smearing everybody who questioned the grandiose plans of the
Great Leader for remaking America
and the world. Nobody was getting a hotter dose of this smearing than
the American Congress. The radio and
the frightened press and magazines kept up a barrage against the members
of the President's own party in both
houses. It was a Democratic bill and the blast that exploded in his face brought
him up with a jerk. In the upper house, Senator Barkley, Democratic
leader, Roosevelt's own representative
there, rose to upbraid him. He said the message was "a calculated and
deliberate assault upon the legislative
integrity of every member of Congress." He cried: "I do not propose
to take it lying down," as Democratic and
Republican senators united in a roar of applause. He ended his philippic
with an announcement that made
headlines in every paper in the country. He declared that after seven
years of carrying the New Deal banner for
the President, he now resigned his post as Democratic majority leader
and he called on every member of the
Congress to preserve its selfYDrespect and override the veto. The Senate
overrode it 72 to 14 and the House 299
to 95. It brought Roosevelt tumbling off his high horse. He sent Steve
Early running to Barkley's home that
very night to beg him not to quit. Barkley yielded. McIntire was a naval doctor in 1932 and was recommended to
Roosevelt as White House physician by Admiral Grayson. McIntire was
an eye, ear and nose specialist. He got
along famously with Roosevelt, was elevated by him to the grade of
admiral and made head of the Naval
Hospital Service. Thus once again the problem of disease entangled itself in the making
of history. It had happened after the First World War when the President was stricken
by a brain
hemorrhage that paralyzed his body and impaired his mind and, worse
than this, disturbed his normal mental
balance. What might have been the course of history had Woodrow Wilson's
mental and physical powers
survived must be a matter of speculation. We have seen how the Communist party had successfully penetrated the
unions organized by the Congress of
Industrial Organizations YD the CIO YD and how John L. Lewis and David
Dubinsky had got out of it for this
reason, leaving Sidney Hillman in complete control. We have also seen
how the war brought Hillman to the top
in White House circles when he and William Knudsen became the directors
of the economic war effort.
Knudsen departed in good time, but Hillman remained close to the White
House. . By 1943, Earl Browder, Communist
leader, had about completed the discovery that there was no hope for
a proletarian revolution in America. The
party got nowhere preaching Communism. The people just wouldn't listen.
But it learned that it could getyYYY   far by using a different technique. After all, Communist revolutionaries
know that before they can introduce
Communism they must destroy the political and economic system of the
country in which they conspire. t fascism YD the Planned Capitalist Economy
YD is merely a decadent phase of capitalism. For this reason the Communist
party had been promoting with great
success RedYDfront organizations and inducing the most important people,
like Mrs. Roosevelt, Henry Wallace
and scores of prominent leaders in education and public life, to work
with them. As 1944 opened, Browder decided to liquidate the Communist party. It
would go out of politics. It would
become a mere educational association. This was done, and Browder and
Sidney Hillman teamed up to capture
the American Labor Party. This had been formed originally in New ork
City to provide a political vehicle for
Fiorello LaGuardia in his local politics. It had all sorts of people
in it. There were a lot of Reds, a lot of socialists
and a lot of parlor and campus pinks of all sorts, plus a lot of social
reformers and welfare reformers. It had
corralled a lot of votes YD enough to swing an election in New ork
State YD by giving or withholding its vote
from the Democrats. It supported Lehman in 1940 and elected him on
the Democratic ticket. It refused to
endorse the Democratic candidate, Bennett, for governor in 1942 and
the Democratic vote, without it, was
insufficient and thus Dewey became governor. Now Browder and Hillman
joined forces and decided to take
over the American Labor Party. They met resistance from the mixed collection
of pinks who had control, but in
a bitter battle Browder and Hillman took it over. Actually Browder
dominated this team because it was
Communist votes that did the trick. In addition to this, Hillman had organized in 1943 a new political
labor group called the CIO Political Action
Committee. The CIO had violated the law by supporting candidates in
various primary elections and to get
around this Hillman formed this Political Action Committee and pressure
was put on members of CIO unions to
compel them to join. This organization was now being used as a club
in the Democratic party to bludgeon
Democratic congressmen and officials generally to play ball with Hillman,
Wallace and their crowd, while
Hillman and Browder did business as a team in New ork State in the
newly reYDformed Communist American
Labor Party. The Democratic party could win if it could carry the Southern states
and in addition New ork, Massachusetts,
Illinois, Michigan and New Jersey. These states could be carried with
the support of Sidney Hillman's Political
Action Committee and Browder's American Labor Party, but not without
them and Roosevelt was the only
possible candidate who could get this support. The Democrats had to
nominate Roosevelt or lose the election.
There were some Democrats who thought it was better to lose the election,
but not enough of them.
Accordingly when the convention assembled in Chicago on July 19, Sidney
Hillman was there, not as a
delegate YD he was not even a member of the party YD but to see that
the subservient Democrats behaved to his
satisfaction and to the satisfaction of his friend and partner, Browder.
To this pass had Roosevelt's personal
political ambitions brought the Democratic party of Jefferson, Cleveland
and Wilson. Hillman had a
headquarters there. He wasn't worried about Roosevelt's nomination.
That was settled. He wasn't worried about
the platform. That was written to his satisfaction before the convention
assembled by Sam Rosenman. He had
one more demand. He wanted Henry Wallace nominated again for Vice President.
Harry Hopkins and Henry Wallace and, of course, Sidney Hillman
knew. They knew that Roosevelt was doomed and that if they could name
Henry Wallace Vice President this
time, the government would be in their hands. But Chicago had a visitor about whom nothing was known until later.
On the evening of July 14, Roosevelt left
Washington with great secrecy on a special train. It reached Chicago
on Saturday the 15th. That same day,
Robert E. Hannegan, Democratic national chairman, got to Chicago. Reporters
awaited him at the station. But
he slipped out through a rear door of his train and into Mayor Kelly's
policeYDescorted automobile and vanished.
Reporters frantically hunted him all over town. He remained out of
sight until the next day. But in the meantime
he had made a visit to Roosevelt's train, secretly parked on a remote
railroad siding. There poor Wallace's
goose was cooked. Hannegan, too, got a letter. It said the President
would be happy to have either Harry
Truman or William Douglas as his running mate. And as Hannegan was
leaving the train, Roosevelt warned
him "to clear everything with Sidney." The Presidential approval of
Truman was no good until Sidney O.K.'d it
Truman was nominated with 1100 votes to only 66 for
Wallace. But not until Sidney Hillman had approved the change. His first speech was not made until September 24 to a dinner given
by the International Teamsters'
Union dominated by Daniel Tobin YD an AFL union. Its purpose was to
put some emphasis on the support of the
AFL in view of the bitter feeling among AFL leaders because of the
dominant role Sidney Hillman's CIO was
playing in Roosevelt's councils and particularly in its favored position
before Roosevelt's Labor Board
Secret Service Page-
The first occurred on February 1, 1933, in Miami, Florida Giuseppe
Zangara fired five
shots a President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was making an impromptu
speech while sitting
in an open car that had stopped momentarily. Although none of the shots
hit President Roosevelt,
Zangara mortally wounded Anton Cermak, the Mayor of Chicago, and hit
four other people,
including a Secret Service agent.
On February 15, 1933, Zangara attended
a speech given by Roosevelt at Bayfront Park in Miami, Florida.
When Roosevelt had finished his talk and was preparing to leave,
Zangara pulled out a pistol and opened fire. A bystander
deflected the assassin's aim by pushing his arm into the air.
Zangara wounded five people who had been near the
president-elect, two of them seriously. Most critically injured was
Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who was struck by the bullet in
the chest which then lodged in his spine. Zangara was immediately charged with four counts of attempted
murder. He was not charged initially with the wounding of
Cermak, as authorities waited to see if the mayor's wounds
would prove fatal. The State charged Zangara for attempting to
murder Franklin Roosevelt, Russell Caldwell, Margaret Kruise,
and William Sinnott. Zangara was found guilty on each count and
sentenced to four consecutive twenty year terms. On March 6, Mayor Cermak died from complications stemming
from the shooting. The same day Zangara was indicted by a
grand jury and charged with first degree murder in the death of
Cermak. His trial began on March 9 and ended on March 11
with a guilty verdict and a death sentence. The prisoner was
transported to the Florida State Prison at Raiford, where he was
executed on March 20, 1933. The parade car moved slowly down the street as President-elect Roosevelt
and Mayor Cermak
smiled and waved. The car stopped and President-elect Roosevelt gave
a speech while sitting on
the back of the car. A man named Guiseppe Zangara pushed through the
crowd. He fired five
shots at the President-elect. The bullets hit four people and Mayor
Cermak. The mayor fell out of
the car and called out "The President, get him away!" But Roosevelt
ordered his car to stop and
that Mayor Cermak be put in with him. President-elect Roosevelt held
Mayor Cermak all the way
to the hospital.
Mayor Anton J. Cermak died three weeks later, on March 8, 1933. His
body was taken back to
Chicago and buried in the Bohemian National Cemetery.
Guiseppe Zangara was executed in the electric chair on March 21, 1933.
That was only 13 days
after Mayor Cermak died.
It was not always thus. Consider the case of Guiseppe Zangara, who
was executed in 1933 for the
attempted assassination of President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt in
which Chicago Mayor Anton
J. Cermak was fatally shot. Zangara pleaded guilty in state court on
March 10, was sentenced to
death, and was executed on March 20 -- an interval of 10 days! Kenneth

New ork ears 1928-1933 (Random House, 1985) at 427-435.
After Roosevelt had delivered a
speech in Florida on February 14, 1938, Guiseppe Zangara, an unemployed
bricklayer, fired six
sbots from a handgun at Roosevelt from twelve yards away. The president
elect, who was sitting
in an open car, was uninjured but five other people were shot, including
Chicago mayor Anton
Cernak, who was killed. Zangara, who had a pathological hatred for
rich and powerful figures,
was found guilty of murder and electrocuted.February 15, 1933, Guiseppe
Zangara rose early in Miami, Florida to assassinate Franklin
Delano Roosevelt, president-elect. In the past weeks, FDR's popularity
had increased. That
warm, reassuring voice, that ready grin and tilted cigarette holder,
had reached out to touch
millions of folks all over America. Zangara did not share these emotions.
Pushing his way through
the crowd, Zangara shouted out "There are too many people starving
to death!" He fired shot after
shot at FDR, but a woman's quick move knocked the gun upward. The bullets
hit several
bystanders and mortally wounded Mayor Cermak of Miami.

On March 21, 1933, Zangara marched into the execution chamber shouting
against the
"capitalists" and expressing disappointment that no news camera-men
were permitted to witness
his execution. "Goodbye, adios to the world," were his last words.

Giuseppe Zangara was sentenced to serve 80 years for shooting at President
elect Franklin
Roosevelt in 1933. Though Roosevelt was missed, five bystanders, including
Chicago Mayor
Anton Cermak, were struck. Three weeks after the attack, Cermak died
of complications.
Zangara's sentence was then changed to death sentence. Thirty-three
days after the attack,
Zangara was strapped into the electric chair at Florida's Raiford Prison.
He glared at his
executioners and declared, "Goodbye, adios to all the world." His unclaimed
body was buried
in an unmarked prison grave.
In 1989, as part of an effort by court officials to recover missing
court files of
historical significance, he filed an FOIA request with the U.S. Secret
seeking to get back court files concerning assassin Giuseppe Zangara.
Zangara, a 32-year-old bricklayer, fired four shots at President-elect
Roosevelt's motorcade in 1933 in Miami. Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak
killed and four people were wounded. Roosevelt escaped unharmed. Zangara
was found guilty of murder and was executed about a month later.
Winslow said a Miami court order showed that a Secret Service agent
checked out Zangara's death warrant and some other court documents
in 1954
but never had returned them. Unfortunately, he said, the FOIA request
failed to
turn up the missing documents.

by DOMINIQUE VIDAL
National and/or social liberation movements worldwide are equally affected.
ideology and power bloc which used to be their mainstay, whether they
liked it or
not, has disappeared. The various movements and causes have dropped
out of the
international spotlight and are no longer up for grabs in the East
West confrontation.
In fact, amid general indifference, they have largely forfeited their
means of action and
political leverage. With its main enemy out of the way, along with the economic, ideological
and military
threat it represented, the West, led by the United States, has now
become the master
of the world. A damaging result of this new world order has been the
beginning of the
process of globalisation. It is no paradox to say it probably began
on 9 November
1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall, or in August 1991 when Mikhail
rallied to the American crusade in the Gulf, or indeed on 8 December
1991, the date
of the dissolution of the Soviet Union
For decades, every socialist project was contrasted with its only existing
embodiment: so-called "real" socialism. And, among revolutionary forces
the process of devising a plausible radical alternative was tragically
limited by the
Soviet horizon. So, despite the consequences described at the beginning, the fall of
removes a severe handicap. Far from presaging the end of history and
the irrelevance
of radical thought, it actually gives a whole new lease of life to
ideas of utopia. Future
generations will have the freedom to conceive a different kind of society
having to define themselves in terms of a communist model. Of course,
there is no
going back to a clean slate. However, with the passing of time, it
should be possible
to learn lessons from the failure of communism and - in other forms
and for other
reasons - social-democratic reformism. The human imagination must find
a new way
of thinking based on what men and women need, rather than theoretical
or dogmatic
concepts to be "implemented". The questions we must ask ourselves may have a familiar ring. How are
pluralism, rights and freedoms to be revitalised, but sheltered from
totalitarian intent?
How is equality of opportunity and social justice to be guaranteed
and the security to
which people are entitled assured, without a general "dumbing down"
and stifling of
initiative? How can the fulfilment of basic social needs be made into
a priority for the
economy without affecting its development? How can the necessary resources
found for a new balance between work, training, family and community
life, and
leisure activities when people's time is at last freed up? How can
the ground be laid
for a distribution of wealth which, worldwide, respects the right of
all peoples to
development? How can the role of the state be made to serve all these
while at the same time the independence of each citizen and each local
community is
assured? In short, how is the relationship between individuals and
society to be
reinvented? To these and many other questions, there are no longer
any ready-made
answers. However, the way is now open and the ground ready to be cleared. At
last. Translated by Sally Blaxland
IGNACIO RAMONET
Last January, the corridors of a number of European airports were adorned
with a
poster in the style of the Chinese cultural revolution. It showed a
row of
demonstrators at the head of a march, their faces shining, their colourful
blowing in the wind. The slogan they were chanting was "Capitalists
of the world,
unite!" For Forbes, America's magazine for millionaires, this was more
than a jibe at
the 150th anniversary of the publication of Marx and Engels' Communist
Manifesto. It was a way of making two things clear. Apparently without fear of
contradiction, as
the posters were not torn down or defaced. The first is that nobody
is afraid of
communism any longer. The second is that capitalism has gone over to
the attack. capitalism's new-found arrogance. The triumphal tone became apparent after the fall of the Berlin Wall,
when the Soviet
Union collapsed in a welter of political obtuseness reflecting the
emptiness of
shattered illusions. The sudden revelation of the full consequences
of decades of state
control in the countries of the former Eastern bloc produced a sort
of mental
upheaval. The tragic absurdity of a system lacking basic freedoms and
a market
economy was starkly exposed, as were all the injustices that had followed
in its
wake. Socialist thinking seemed to subside, along with the belief in
progress and a
future subject to rational planning. The sole ideological basis of the traditional right had been its anti
communism. The
collapse of the Soviet system and the implosion of socialism cut the
ground from
under its feet. Neoliberalism, which had been flagging since the beginning
of the
century, was left alone in the field, the sole victor of the East-West
With its main rivals removed, it has re-emerged on all sides, stronger
than ever. Its
supporters dream of imposing their vision - a neoliberal utopia admitting
of no
alternative - on the whole world. This campaign of conquest goes by the name of globalisation. It is
the outcome of the
increasing interdependence of all countries, brought about by the lifting
of all controls
on the movement of capital, the removal of customs barriers and administrative
restrictions, and the intensification of international commerce and
free trade; all this
under the auspices of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund,
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the World
Organisation. The financial economy has become entirely divorced from the real economy.
The sum
total of daily financial transactions throughout the world is about
$1,500 billion, but a
mere 1 % involves the creation of new wealth. Even in the most developed countries, the dramatic advance of neoliberalism
significantly reduced the role of parliaments and other public players.
At the same time, the growth of new information technologies is proceeding
any reference to the idea of social progress. The enormous strides
in molecular
biology since the early 1960s, coupled with the immense calculating
power provided
by computer science, have shattered the stability of the technological
matrix which
public authorities are finding it harder and harder to control. Politicians
can no longer
assess the risks involved in the acceleration of science and technology
(1). Here too,
they are increasingly dependent on unelected experts, who direct the
decision-making process behind the scenes. The information revolution has torn our society apart. It has overturned
established pattern of trade, opening the way for the expansion of
the global and
information economy. Not all the countries of the world have yet been
forced into
one unit. But the global economy is imposing a single economic model
by networking
the entire planet. In this new system of liberal social relations,
humankind has been
reduced to a collection of isolated individuals stranded in a universe
hypertechnology. These brutal changes are causing us to lose our bearings; there is
uncertainty, the world appears unintelligible and history seems to
defy rational
interpretation. The crisis we are experiencing is what Gramsci had
in mind when he
spoke of the old order dying while the new hesitates to be born. We
are reminded of
Tocqueville's phrase: "When the past no longer illuminates the future,
the spirit walks
in darkness." And yet, many people are trying to inject some measure of humanity
into the
relentless machinery of neoliberalism. They feel the need for responsible
and collective action. In an age when power has become abstract, invisible,
and impersonal, they want to confront those responsible face to face,
to direct their
anger, fears and frustration at clearly identified adversaries of flesh
and blood. They
would still be prepared to believe that politics has an answer to everything,
though politicians find it increasingly difficult to propose straightforward
solutions to
the complex problems of society. And they all feel the need to erect
a barrier against
the tidal wave of neoliberalism in the form of a coherent ideology
that can be
opposed to the currently dominant model. To formulate that ideology is no easy matter. There is practically
nothing left to build
on. Previous utopias based on the idea of progress have all too often
sunk into
authoritarian rule and oppression. Once again, there is a need for dreamers who can think and thinkers
who can dream.
The answer will not be a neatly packaged, custom-built project. It
will be a way of
looking at things, of analysing society, leading gradually to the development
of a new
ideology that will break the stranglehold of anarcho-liberalism. *** sog ***

rights (Droit au Logement - DAL). There has also been considerable
growth in local
branches of large NGOs like Greenpeace, Amnesty International, MYdecins

their credibility.
First, they are all-embracing, claiming to be able to solve all society's
Second, they are geographically restricted, i.e. they can act only
within the frontiers
of a single country. Campaigning groups have exactly the opposite properties.
On the
one hand they are thematic, i.e. concerned with single issues such
as unemployment,
housing and the environment. On the other, they are international,
i.e. their field of
action is the whole planet (4). For many years the supporters of these two different approaches have
been at odds
with each other, but recently there have been signs of convergence.
It is vital that they
join forces. This is one of the key problems of political renewal.
Campaigning groups
are grass-roots organisations, testifying to the richness of social

It is
therefore essential to build strong links between campaigning organisations
political parties. Campaigning organisations have preserved the belief in the possibility
of changing the
world, a belief based on a radical conception of democracy. They are
the probable
source of a renewal of political activity in Europe. . "Today's utopia is tomorrow's
reality", as Victor Hugo said. Lamartine agreed that utopias are simply
whose time is not yet ripe." It is the committed activists of campaigning
who are likely to prove them right. They will resurface tomorrow under
banners. They will be involved in struggles to restore the United Nations' role
as the central
instrument of international law, to turn it into an organisation that
can take real
decisions, act decisively and impose lasting peace; to establish international
that can judge crimes against humanity, democracy and the common good;
to prevent
manipulation of the masses and to end discrimination against women.
They will be
present in campaigns to secure new legislation on protection of the
environment and
to establish the principle of sustainable development. In the fight
to ban tax havens
and promote an economic system based on solidarity. And in many others.

THERE IS ANOTHER, BETTER WORLD
The hazards of internationalism
Billions of men and women, rendered powerless by the
fragmentation of the social struggle, are pinning their hopes on a
new universalism that does not leave the delicate fabric of the
world entirely in the hands of the money men.
by ALAIN GRESH
We live in extraordinary times. Globalisation is carrying all before
it, our means of
communication allow us contact in real time with any place you care
to name, more
people than ever before are travelling the world, yet paradoxically
the media space
devoted to "foreign affairs" is shrinking to vanishing point. All the
research bears this
out. Be it in Paris, Washington (1), London or Madrid, television and
press coverage
of international problems has been substantially reduced. However,
there is an
exception to every rule and we are informed instantly of any drop in
the Nikkei index
in Tokyo, invited to rejoice at the new heights reached by the Dow
Jones on Wall
Street or worry about exchange rate fluctuations in Seoul. Stock exchange
news has
become the only social glue binding the global village together. Alain Badiou observes in a stimulating reflection on universalism (3),
this "process of
fragmentation into separate and isolated identities" is only another
aspect of a "world
that has finally been given a configuration, as a market, a world market.
Nothing", he
continues, "lends itself more to the invention of new patterns for
a uniform monetary
system than a community and its territory or territories. What endless
for trade and investment" these innumerable new communities offer as
they arise. The
many separate states that have replaced ugoslavia or the Soviet Union
offered no
resistance to the juggernaut of the free market economy. As Alain Badiou observes, "at a time of general movement and the dream
of instant
cultural exchange, more and more laws and regulations are being introduced
everywhere to curtail people's freedom of movement ... Free movement
for things
that can be counted, by all means, especially for capital, the very
essence of such
things. But free movement for things that cannot be counted, for the
infinite value
represented by an individual human life, never! As regards the real
life of people and
what happens to them", there is - and we must never forget it - "a
complicity between the globalised logic of capital and the French mania
to preserve
their identity". the nation-state - a recent and transitory historical
phenomenon (7) - is clearly not the symbolic ideal construct some sentimental
elements of the left like to imagine. It has been a key factor in colonial
opposition to the labour movement, enforcing moral order, discrimination
women, the marginalisation of minorities, and so on and so on. And
the current drift
into authoritarian attitudes vis-Y-vis "dangerous elements" and immigrants
unacceptable, even in the name of a self-styled "republican order".
How are we to find new forms of rebellion, of dissidence, to meet the
new global
modern means of communication, especially the Internet, it is easy
to establish
worldwide networks, mobilise, act. But to act locally and on a world scale, to "think global", it is necessary
to rediscover
universalism, a universalism that is not confined to the values of
Western White men,
who fall into a trance at the sight of a young girl in a veil and whose
real aim in life, to
quote Alain Badiou, is "the uniform imposition of what they imagine
to be modern".
Humanitarian action or laissez-faire?
The stagnation of the Soviet system and the collapse of the communist
utopia brought
discredit on a certain version of internationalism. Even the humanitarianism,
rallied millions of men and women to the cause of emergency aid in
time of war and
natural disaster, rapidly ran out of steam. No-one was quicker than
the organisers of
M_dicins sans fronti_res, the organisation that exemplifies that approach,
to condemn
the political authorities' use of "humanitarian" aid to justify a laissez
faire attitude
towards the crimes in Bosnia or the genocide in Rwanda. And yet, in the face of fundamentalism, hardening attitudes on identity,
confrontations between increasingly insulated ethnic groups (which
do not prevent
their foot-soldiers from drinking Coca Cola, their intellectuals from
using Microsoft
software, and their leaders from calling on the resources of international
capital), the
peoples of the world have got to find new ways of "living together"
and "fighting
together". They have nothing to lose from embracing this ideal and,
to quote Marx
and Engels, "they have a world to win".

And though the
murderers may escape the just resentment of an enraged people; though
drowsy justice, intoxicated by the poisonous draught prepared for her
cup, still nods upon her rotten seat, yet be assured such complicated
crimes will meet their due reward.
Standing armies are sometimes (I would by no
means say generally, much less universally) composed of persons who
have rendered themselves unfit to live in civil society; who have no
motives of conduct than those which a desire of the present gratification
their passions suggests; who have no property in any country; men who
have given up their own liberties, and envy those who enjoy liberty;
are equally indifferent to the glory of a George or a Louis; who, for
addition of one penny a day to their wages, would desert from the
Christian cross and fight under the crescent of the Turkish Sultan.

Secret Service
the start of the Spanish-American War led to the first legal use of
the Secret
Service for Presidential protection. A detail of four agents, operating
under special emergency was
fund, was assigned to the Executive Mansion to guard McKinley around
the clock. They were
stationed on the first and second floors of the Mansion and on the
White House grounds. [13]
[13 During the Spanish-American War, the Secret Service also served
as the primary intelligence
agency for the War Departnent. It gathered intelligence and conducted
counter espionage activities
both domestically and abroad.]
After the war, Secret Service operatives continued to serve at the
White House at least part
of the time. In addition, operatives regularly accompanied McKinley
during his travels. With the
expiration of the emergency war fund these activities once again exceeded
the Secret Service's
statutory authority. However, Secret Service Chief John Wilkie felt
obligated to provide the
protection anyway. President McKinley received a large number of threats,
which seemed
particularly credible in light of a series of political assassinations
that took place in Europe during
this period.
In 1901, President McKinley was shot and fatally wounded by anarchist
Leon Czolgosz
while standing in a receiving line at the Pan American Exposition in
Buffalo, New ork. Three
Secret Service operatives were guarding him at the time, along with
eighteen exposition policemen,
eleven members of the Coast Guard, and four Buffalo city detectives.
One of the Secret Service
operatives was out of position when Czolgosz approached President McKinley,
because the
president of the exposition d requested the spot directly next to MdCinley,
where the operative
normally stood.
, in 1906, Congress quietly included language in the Sundry Civil Expenses
Act authorizing
the Secretary of the Treasury to use funds for "the protection of theperson
of the President of the
United States."
{Treasury=Money=Illuminatti - sog}
Since the Secret Service was officially
authorized to provide protective services in 1906, only one person
has been killed under its watch
- President John F. Kennedy, who was fatally wounded by Lee Harvey
Oswald while riding in a
motorcade through Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963.
Since the inception of the Secret Service, however, there also have
been six other
potentially deadly assaults on Secret Service protectees.
The first occurred on February 1, 1933, in Miami, Florida Giuseppe
Zangara fired five
shots a President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was making an impromptu
speech while sitting
in an open car that had stopped momentarily. Although none of the shots
hit President Roosevelt,
Zangara mortally wounded Anton Cermak, the Mayor of Chicago, and hit
four other people,
including a Secret Service agent.

In assassination cases, there has always existed the dilemma of establishing
the murderer's
sanity. Authorities are uncomfortable to admit that sane people kill
government leaders. At the
same time, many feel that if the assassin is deemed insane, he will
escape "proper" punishment.
It is much easier to lock upon the assassin as a steely-eyed, cold
blooded killer, who is a threat
to society...and only half crazy.
Nineteen days after Fromme's failed attempt, Sara Jane Moore fired
a shot at President Ford,
but missed. Prior to the attack, she wrote the following poem:
"Hold-Hold, still my hand.
Steady my eye, chill my heart,
And let my gun sing for the people.
Scream their anger, cleanse with their And kill this monster."
While most assassins have deep, emotional problems, few are truly insane,
unable to distinguish
between right and wrong. Defendants are presumed to be sane and responsible
for their crimes
until the contrary can be proven. In order to establish insanity, it
must be proved that, at the time
of the offense, the defendant was laboring under such a defect or disease
of the mind so as not
to know the nature and quality of the act or did not know that it was
wrong. This is referred to
as the McNaughton Rule, and it is based on an 1843 assassination case.

They are easy for politicians to manipulate and are no threat to do
anything very imaginative or even act in concert in defense of their

What one must keep in mind in regard to this stereotype is that it
constitutes an assertion as to fact.
In other words, it is not a moral principle, it is not a value judgement,
and it is not, in itself, an

that it was false, then it
would be an expression of prejudice.

e sum total of the effort. Attacks on certain forms of religious expression
are part of it also, but it
is the "Civil Rights Movement" that provides an excuse for government
to intrude into all kinds of
interpersonal relationships. The more the government can do this, the
more people are alienated
from society. People are no longer accountable to one another but to
a vast impersonal
bureaucracy. One must recall that this is the basic premise of Totalitarian
social organization.
The purpose of this effort is to crush all opposition to the agenda
of the ruling oligarchy. The
democratic forms are meaningless in the absence of a willingness on
the part of the population in
general to assume collective responsibility for the maintenance of
social order. All power ultimately
lies in the hands of those who perform that function. The people in
general can only do this by
means of imposing their collective identity in the ways the author
has described. If one can destroy
the emotional and spiritual bonds that provide the sort of collective
identity which U.S. society
once had, then one has only millions of sheep and a few wolves.
. From a recent book on the human brain one has:
The sexes are different because their brains are different. The brain,
the chief administrative and
emotional organ of life, is differently constructed in men and in women;
it processes information in
a different way, which results in different perceptions, priorities
and behavior.
human behavior in general is much more biologically driven than was
believed previously.
What this means, among other things, is that human behavior cannot
be modified beyond certain
limits. It is not possible, for instance, to fundamentally change the
nature of the male/female
The problem in this Detroit neighborhood is not that welfare benefits
are too low. After all, these
people are very wealthy compared to Mr. Santiago. What they have not
received from society is a
strong sense of ethnic identity. As a result, they have rejected society
and have set out to make
their own. One sees them assuming the responsibility for the maintenance
of social order but in an
antisocial context. The gang symbols and mode of dress are a typical
male effort to impose their
identity on the environment, just as Mr. Santiago was doing in placing
flowers at the statue of the
patron saint. In the matter of the gang symbols, however, one sees
a pattern of social
In the case of Americans, great efforts are made in the form of entertainment,
religious activities (The Branch Davidians, for example), appeals to
great collective efforts (Save
the Whale), self improvement (lose weight), and many other artificial
undertakings to give life
meaning and purpose. The problem with American society is precisely this artificiality.
If one rejects ethnic identity and
the social cohesion that it provides, then one must resort to coercion.
Unfortunately, there is an end to that twisted path. In order to survive,
a society must conform itself
to the psychological needs of the average person and not attempt to
coerce people into

destruction of history and culture.
Neoliberalism thus imposes the destruction of
nations and of groups of nations in order to fuse them into one single
model. The war
which neoliberalism is conducting against humanity is thus a planetary
war, and is the
worst and most cruel ever seen.
What we have here is a puzzle. The first of these pieces is the two-fold accumulation of wealth and
of poverty at the
two poles of planetary society. The second is the total exploitation
of the totality of
the world. The third is the nightmare of that part of humanity condemned
to a life of
wandering. The fourth is the sickening relationship between crime and
state power.
The fifth is state violence. The sixth is the mystery of megapolitics.
The seventh is the
multiple forms of resistance which humanity is deploying against neoliberalism.
Piece no. 1: The concentration of wealth and the distribution of poverty
The earth has five billion human inhabitants:
of these, only 500 million live comfortably; the remaining 4.5 billion
endure lives of
poverty. The gap between rich and poor is enormous: far from decreasing, social
inequalities are growing.
Piece no. 2: The globalisation of exploitation
the world capitalist system is
"modernising" the production, circulation and consumption of commodities.
The new
technological revolution (information technology) and the new revolution
in politics
(the megalopolises emerging from the ruins of the nation state) produce
a new social
"revolution". This social revolution consists of a rearrangement, a
reorganisation of
social forces and, principally, of the workforce.
The world's economically active population (EAP) went from 1.38 billion
in 1960 to
2.37 billion in 1990. A large increase in the number of human beings
capable of
working and generating wealth. But the new world order arranges this
within specific geographical and productive areas, and reassigns their
functions (or
non-functions, in the case of unemployed and precarious workers) within
the plan of
world globalisation. The world's economically active population by
sector (EAPS)
has undergone radical changes during the past 20 years. Agriculture
and fishing fell
from 22 % in 1970 to 12 % in 1990; manufacture from 25 % to 22 %; but
tertiary sector (commercial, transport, banking and services) has risen
from 42 % to
56 %. In developing countries, the tertiary sector has grown from 40
% in 1970 to
57 % in 1990, while agriculture and fishing have fallen from 30 % to
15 % (2). This
means that increasing numbers of workers are channelled into the kind
of activities
necessary for increasing productivity or speeding up the creation of
this "modern" capitalist production
continues to rely on child labour. Out of 1.15 billion children in
the world, at least
100 million live on the streets and 200 million work
The globalised
market is destroying small and medium- sized companies. With the disappearance
local and regional markets, small and medium producers have no protection
and are
unable to compete with the giant transnationals.
All this combines to create a specific surplus: an excess of human
beings who are
useless in terms of the new world order because they do not produce,
do not
consume, and do not borrow from banks. In short, human beings who are
disposable. Each day the big finance centres impose their laws on countries
groups of countries all around the world. They re-arrange and re-order
inhabitants of those countries. And at the end of the operation they
find there is still an
"excess" of people.
Piece no. 3: Migration, a nightmare of wandering
there is a proliferation of "regional wars" and "internal
conflicts"; capital follows paths of atypical accumulation; and large
masses of workers
are mobilised. Result: a huge rolling wheel of millions of migrants
moving across the
planet. As "foreigners" in that "world without frontiers" which had
been promised by
the victors of the cold war, they are forced to endure racist persecution,
employment, the loss of their cultural identity, police repression,
hunger, imprisonment
and murder.
The fourth world war - with its
mechanisms of destruction/depopulation and reconstruction/reorganisation
- involves
the displacement of millions of people. Their destiny is to wander
the world, carrying
the burden of their nightmare with them, so as to constitute a threat
to workers who
have a job, a scapegoat designed to make people forget their bosses,
and to provide
a basis for the racism that neoliberalism provokes.
Piece no. 4: Financial globalisation and the generalisation of crime
With the beginning of the fourth world war, organised crime has globalised
activities. The criminal organisations of five continents have taken
on board the "spirit
of world cooperation" and have joined together in order to participate
in the conquest
of new markets. They are investing in legal businesses, not only in
order to launder
dirty money, but in order to acquire capital for illegal operations.
Their preferred
activities are luxury property investment, the leisure industry, the
media - and
According to a UN report,
the involvement of crime syndicates has been facilitated by the programmes
structural adjustment which debtor countries have been forced to accept
in order to
gain access to International Monetary Fund loans (3).
So here we have the rectangular mirror within which legality and illegality
reflections. On which side of the mirror is the criminal? And on which
side is the
person who pursues him?
Piece no. 5: Legitimate violence of illegitimate powers
In the cabaret of globalisation, the state performs a striptease, at
the end of which it is
left wearing the minimum necessary: its powers of repression. With
its material base
destroyed, its sovereignty and independence abolished, and its political
eradicated, the nation state increasingly becomes a mere security apparatus
in the
service of the mega-enterprises which neoliberalism is constructing.
Instead of
orienting public investment towards social spending, it prefers to
improve the
equipment which enables it to control society more effectively.
What is to be done when the violence derives from the laws of the market?
Where is
legitimate violence then? And where the illegitimate?
The monopoly of
violence no longer belongs to nation states: the market has put it
up for auction.
However, when the monopoly of violence is contested not on the basis
of the laws of
the market, but in the interests of "those from below", then world
power sees it as
"aggression". This is one of the (least studied and most condemned)
aspects of the
challenges launched by the indigenous peoples in arms and in rebellion
of the
Zapatista National Liberation Army against neoliberalism and for humanity.
The new world police
wants national armies and police to be simple security bodies guaranteeing
order and progress within the megalopolises of neoliberalism.
Piece no. 6: Megapolitics and its dwarfs
But neoliberalism does not conduct its war
solely by "unifying" nations and regions. Its strategy of destruction/depopulati
reconstruction/reorganisation also produces a fracture or fractures
within the nation
state. This is the paradox of this fourth world war: while ostensibly
working to
eliminate frontiers and "unite" nations, it actually leads to a multiplication
of frontiers
and the smashing apart of nations.
The elimination of trade
frontiers, the explosion of telecommunications, information superhighways,
omnipresence of financial markets, international free trade agreements
- all this
contributes to destroying nation states and internal markets. Paradoxically,
globalisation produces a fragmented world of isolated pieces, a world
full of
watertight compartments which may at best be linked by fragile economic
Mega-politics globalises
national politics - in other words it ties them to a centre which has
world interests and
which operates on the logic of the market. It is in the name of the
market that wars,
credits, buying and selling of commodities, diplomatic recognition,
trade blocs,
political support, laws on immigration, breakdowns of relationships
countries and investment - in short, the survival of entire nations
- are decided.
The world-wide power of the financial markets is such that they are
not concerned
about the political complexion of the leaders of individual countries:
what counts in
their eyes is a country's respect for the economic programme. Financial
are imposed on all alike. These masters of the world can even tolerate
the existence
of left-wing governments, on condition that they adopt no measure likely
to harm the
interests of the market. However, they will never accept policies that
tend to break
with the dominant model.
Piece no. 7: Pockets of resistance
"To begin with, I ask you not to confuse resistance with political
Opposition does not oppose itself to power but to a government, and
its fully-formed
shape is that of an opposition party; resistance, on the other hand,
cannot be a party,
by definition: it is not made in order to govern but... to resist."
(TomY s Segovia,
"Alegatorio", Mexico, 1996)
The apparent infallibility of globalisation comes up hard against the
disobedience of reality. While neoliberalism is pursuing its war, groups
of protesters,
kernels of rebels, are forming throughout the planet. The empire of
financiers with full
pockets confronts the rebellion of pockets of resistance. es, pockets.
Of all sizes,
of different colours, of varying shapes. Their sole common point is
a desire to resist
the "new world order" and the crime against humanity that is represented
by this
fourth world war.
Whereas the ZNLA fights to defend national sovereignty, the Mexican
Federal Army
functions to protect a government which has destroyed the material
bases of
sovereignty and which has offered the country not only to large-scale
foreign capital,
but also to drug trafficking.
The possible shapes are as numerous as the forms of
resistance themselves, as numerous as all the worlds existing in this
world. So draw
whatever shape you like. In this matter of pockets, as in that of resistance,
diversity is
a wealth.

Office of the Press Secretary
For Immediate Release                                       May 12,
INTERNATIONAL CRIME CONTROL STRATEG
International crime is a serious and potent threat to the American
people at home and abroad.  Drug and firearms trafficking, terrorism,
money laundering, counterfeiting, illegal alien smuggling, trafficking
in women and children, advanced fee scams, credit card fraud, auto
theft, economic espionage, intellectual property theft, computer
hacking, and public corruption are all linked to international criminal
activity and all have a direct impact on the security and prosperity
the American people.
Americans spend billions of dollars annually on cocaine and heroin,
of which originates abroad; in 1997, there were 123 terrorist attacks
against U.S. targets worldwide, including 108 bombings and eight
kidnappings; each year, approximately one billion dollars worth of
stolen cars are smuggled out of this country; annually, U.S. companies
lose up to $23 billion from the illegal duplication and piracy of films,
compact discs, computer software, pharmaceutical and textile products,
while U.S. credit card companies suffer losses of hundreds of millions
of dollars from international fraud; and several hundred U.S. companies
and other organizations have already suffered computer attacks in 1998,
resulting in millions of dollars of losses and significant threats
our safety and security.
The International Crime Control Strategy (ICCS) addresses this
increasing threat by providing a framework for integrating all facets
the federal government response to international crime.  This first
strategy reflects the high priority accorded international crime by
Administration and builds on such existing strategies as the National
Drug Control Strategy and the Presidential Directives on alien
smuggling, counter-terrorism and nuclear materials safety and security.
The ICCS is also an important initiative in terms of enhancing the
ability of U.S. law enforcement officials to cooperate effectively
their overseas counterparts in investigating and prosecuting
international crime cases.  At the upcoming Birmingham Summit, G-8
leaders will discuss international crime as one of the most pressing
issues related to increasing globalization and rapid technological
economic change.  President Clinton will highlight the new ICCS in
underscoring the U.S. commitment to close cooperation with all nations
who are mobilizing to confront this increasing threat.
The ICCS is a plan of action containing eight broad goals with thirty
implementing objectives.  The ICCS expresses President Clinton's resolve
to combat international crime aggressively and substantially reduce
impact on the daily lives of the American people.
The Strategy's eight goals and related objectives are:
1.   Extend the First Line of Defense Beyond U.S. Borders by
(a) preventing acts of international crime planned abroad before
they occur, (b) using all available laws to prosecute select
criminal acts committed abroad, and (c) intensifying activities
of law enforcement, diplomatic and consular personnel abroad.
2.   Protect U.S. Borders by (a) enhancing our land border inspection,
detection and monitoring capabilities, (b) improving the
effectiveness of maritime and air smuggling interdiction efforts,
(c) seeking new, stiffer criminal penalties for smuggling
activities, and (d) targeting enforcement and prosecutorial
resources more effectively against smuggling crimes and
3.   Deny Safe Haven to International Criminals by (a) negotiating
international agreements to create a seamless web for the prompt
location, arrest and extradition of international fugitives,
(b) implementing strengthened immigration laws that prevent
international criminals from entering the United States and
provide for their prompt expulsion when appropriate, and
(c) promoting increased cooperation with foreign law enforcement
4.   Counter International Financial Crime by (a) combating money
laundering and strengthening enforcement efforts to reduce inbound
and outbound movement of criminal proceeds, (b) seizing the assets
of international criminals, (c) enhancing bilateral and
multilateral cooperation against all financial crime, and
(d) targeting offshore centers of international fraud,
counterfeiting, electronic access device schemes and other
financial crimes.
5.   Prevent Criminal Exploitation of International Trade by (a)
interdicting illegal technology exports, (b) preventing unfair and
predatory trade practices in violation of U.S. criminal law, (c)
protecting intellectual property rights, (d) countering industrial
theft and economic espionage of U.S. trade secrets, and (e)
enforcing import restrictions on certain harmful substances,
dangerous organisms and protected species.
6.   Respond to Emerging International Crime Threats by (a) disrupting
new activities of international organized crime groups,
(b) enhancing intelligence efforts against criminal enterprises,
(c) reducing trafficking in human beings and crimes against
children, (d) increasing enforcement efforts against high tech
and computer-related crime, and (e) continuing to identify and
counter the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructures and new
technologies in high tech areas.
7.   Foster International Cooperation and the Rule of Law by
(a) establishing international standards, goals and objectives to
combat international crime and by actively encouraging compliance,
(b) improving bilateral cooperation with foreign governments and
law enforcement authorities, and (c) strengthening the rule of law
as the foundation for democratic government and free markets in
order to reduce societies' vulnerability to criminal exploitation.
8.   Optimize the Full Range of U.S. Efforts by (a) enhancing executive
branch policy and operational coordination mechanisms to the risks of criminal threats and to integrate strategies, goals
and objectives to combat those threats, (b) mobilizing and
incorporating the private sector into U.S. government efforts, and
(c) developing measures of effectiveness to assess progress over
ICCS INITIATIVES

@_subject: Quaint Customs Warning - SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY DRUGS!!! 
Canadian Customs Warning - SPACE ALIENS HIDE M DRUGS!!!
  Although the Reptilian Nazis making preparations in the lavoratories
of their SecretUnderGroundBunkers pose an eventual threat to the safety
and security of humanity itself, there are many more immediate dangers
present in our lives which can bring serious consequences to anyone who
remains unaware of them.
  Thus, I feel that it is important for everyday, average citizens to
issue travel warnings for those who may be thinking in venturing into
some of the more corrupt areas of the world, such as Canada, where they
may find themselved subject to arbitrary and capricious actions by the
heavy-handed Canadian Customs BorderGuards before even being allowed to
enter the country, after which they will be subject to whatever illegal
acts and measures that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police choose to perpetrate upon them.
  It is particularly important to be wary of entering through certain
Customs ports, such as Regway, Saskatchewan, which have a long history
of abuse of authority and criminal malefeasance.
  Bill Mitchell, a Canadian Customs OffalSlur at the Regway port, has
been known to steal thousands of dollars worth of goods from those passing
through while he is on duty, while being extremely evasive when asked
about the legality of his conduct, as well as being very inept at hiding
the fact that he is a lying, scumbag piece of shit who is not intelligent
enough to tell even halfway believable lies.
  Although I normally advise people to make what effort they can to get
whatever measure of Justice they can through normal legal channels, in
the case of countries such as Canada, where even high-ranking political
figures are known to be corrupt, where many of the Judges have histories
of corruption, substance abuse and complicity in the illegal activities
of law enforcement officials, I certainly could not find fault with anyone who surveyed the situation they found themselves in and decided
that their best option was to used armed force to prevent becoming a
victim of the oppressive, unethical and illegal actions of armed bandits
working under the cover of Canadian Government Authority.
  As well, although one might morally and ethically be perfectly justified
in putting a bullet through the brain of armed Canadian Government Bandits
who have been trained to deal violently with any person who resists their
attempts at enforcing their alleged authority, even when doing so in an
unethical and illegal manner, it would be unwise for them to act hastily,
since one must be prepared to follow through in regard to such an action,
by also eliminating any other government agents who may be present and
would constitute an immediate or future threat to the individual who
refuses to be subjected to illegal and unethical government actions.
  Although I suppose that one might make a case for being 'better safe
than sorry' when entering Canada through a port such as Regway, and just
going ahead and whacking out the whole lot of them, so that they don't
have a chance to get the jump on you, before proceeding into the country,
I personally think that if one has prepared in advance for dealing with
the danger that the Regway Customs OffalSlurs represent, then this option
should not be necessary.
  Of course, I realize that I, myself, am a rather conservative person,
so I would certainly not pass judgement on those who are more of a
'take the BullShit by the horns' type of individual.
  Being, as I say, rather conservative by nature, I don't usually feel
it necessary to immediately put to death violent armed Canadian Government
Thugs for their crimes against myself or other citizens, even though doing
so might well help to prevent future criminal abuses by violent, armed people in positions of authority, since there area variety of other routes
that one might take in extracting a measure of Justice or EqualizationOf
  As always, anyone who chooses to attempt to receive redress for the
crimes committed against them by those in authoritative government positions will be fighting a battle in which the Canadian Justice System
is stacked against them. Even though Judge Lee, a notorious drunkard who
has performed GodOnlyKnows how many travesties of justice while rendering
legal judgements while totally ShitFaced, has retired, many of the other
Canadian judges, while perhaps not being as totally out-of-control, are
nonetheless known to rubber-stamp pretty much every instance of criminal]
abuse perpetrated on the citizenry, as a matter of course.
  Likewise, the Saskatchewan Justice Department is well-known by the citizens to be a FuckingJoke (TM), and that any person who dares to
file a complaint against members of the Canadian Legal Community can
expect to be subjected to ridicule and abuse by Justice Department
Investigators, as well as perhaps finding themselves the target of
further persecution by those being WhiteWashed by their Justice Department
  Realizing that any citizen who shot and killed an armed intruder in his
home who was attempting to rob HimOrHer of thousands of dollars worth of
personal propery would likely be regarded as a hero, while a citizen who
shot and killed an ArmedCanadianGovernmentThug who was doing the same, would be the immediate subject of villification by all arms of Canadian
Opinon/Reality Creating Agencies, my own preference is to set a goal of
returning (1,000)Tit-for-(1)Tat.
  Being, as I say, a pretty conservative fellow, I have refrained, for
the most part, over the years, from extracting a large measure of revenge
or retribution for the unethical and illegal TravestiesOfJustice that I
have been subjected to by various CanadianAuthorities. Having gone to great lengths to act with reason and civility in the face of oppression
and persecution for quite some length of time, and at considerable personal expense to both my finances and my psyche, I can see no reason
to have any qualms of conscience in regard to henceforth requiring AThousandEyesForAnEye (TM) as a BalanceOfPayments for acts of thievery
and illegality against my person by ArmedCanadianGovernmentThugs.
  Naturally, if anyone feels that they can offer good, solid advice in
regard to why it might be more ethical or justified for me to just keep
on TakingItInTheAssTimeAndTimeAgain without complaint or retribution,
then I would be more than happy to forward them some advice I received

  I have been following, with great mirth, a current thread on the CPUNX
list which expresses great concern over the possible implications to the
issues of freedom and privacy by the plans of the Russian Government
and/or Military implimenting a StateOfTheArt Monitoring/Surveillance
System designed to make BigWolfInBigGrandmothersClothing's ears very, very large indeed. [WAS: "The better to hear EveryOneAndEveryThing with."]
  I find it interesting that there should be such great concern over the
possibility of EvilThings happening in Russia that are already happening
in AmeriKaKa, when few Citizens or NetIzens in this country seem to be
inclined to actually *do* anything in regard to making an effort to hold
accountable those involved in the unethical and criminal persecution of our own DigitalPrisonersOfWar behind Amerika's ElectroMagnetic Curtain.
  What reason is their to be 'concerned' about matters that one is going
to submissively submit to like a LemmingLamb waiting to rush over the
cliff and into the BigMouthBigTeeth of BigBrother?
  James Dalton Bell got RailRoaded, ScrewedBluedAndTattoo'd, SetUp, Fucked
Over, and SoldDownTheFuckingRiver for the diabolical crime of openly
discussing the same types of concepts and issues that our Founding Fathers
wrote about (although they were taking their medication regularly and had
the good sense to publish much of their work via anonymous reprinters).
  ALunaticWhoLooksALotLikeMe got HisorHer computers, and those of family
members, confiscated, HisOrHer Sympatico WebSite deleted, and subjected
to the threat of years of imprisonment, as a result of putting up an
'RCMP HATE PAGE' parody dedicated the belief that making fun of Dudley
DoRight's abuse, persecution and murder of human beings of Native American
ancestry was less of a crime than the actual performance of those types
of criminal misdeeds.
  Unless one is prepared to actually take action to prevent the abuse of
authority, and to hold those responsible for high-handed, unethical and
illegal actions against the Citizens, then the process of 'discussion'
on these issues is mere Philosophical Masturbation.
The rEvolution is NOW!
All that really needs to be said, is "BOOM!"
NEWS FLASH!!!
If, after someone ButtFucks you, you give them a really great BlowJob,
they don't have a whole lot of incentive not to do it again.
If the CriminalFuckers are incapable of understanding that "NO Means NO"
then perhaps they are capable of understanding that "BOOM Means NO."
  The willingness of WeTheSheeple to submissivly submit to the atrocious
lies, abuses, criminal and unethical behavior of the Rulers&Contollers
can be explained, to my mind, by nothing other than BrainWashing.
  The Truth (TM) of the matter is, the ThugsAndThieves who are in control
of this and other countries, are, for the most part, GutLessCowards who
are capable of maintaining their intrusive and excessive hold over the
lives of the citizenry only by virtue of OrganizedMobRuleOfForce over
a ComplacentCitizenry.
  Upon losing the support system of OfficiallyAuthorizedOrganizedCrime,
most of these GutLessCowards fold like a BustedFlush. On the extremely
rare occassions where the GutLessCowards are called to account for their
criminal behavior and abuse of power, They turn in mass fear on one

off enough internal heads, that the citizens are appeased.

Mitch Halloran, unwitting schill of the TrilateralCPU, digitized:
  Working in a Drug Lab, I would imagine that the key required
to make sense of SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY DRUGS!!! is easily within
reach...check the 500 ml beaker to your immediate left...
  To tell the truth, most of my ranting and raving in regard
to the InfernalTruths EreuIndicted in SAHMD is done out of
kindness towards those who are the target of both my BarbLess
Wit and my WitLess Barbs, since merely revealing the NakedTruth
about many of these individuals might result in the Reader having an eye put out, although HeOrShe would still have one
good eye left to see that the person who was giving rise to the BluntNosed Sword of Truth was not the individual's wife.
  ReVisionIst, to me, indicates someone who takes another look
at what was previously seen with the aid of colour-glossy photos
and pie-charts provided by the people who threatened to imprison
your parents if they failed to send you to government-sponsered
IndoctrinationCamps justified under the ruse of FreeEducation,
which sometimes seem mostly geared for reinforcing in our minds
how lucky we are to live in a country where the government is
kind enough to provide us with FreeIncomeTaxReturnForms.
  Son of Mother Of All Chapters, as presented to the CypherPunks
list, quite simply provides a plethora of Official Versions of
the events surrounding the murder of one of Franklin Roosevelt's
political enemies, Anton Cermak.
  Those perusing the material may come to the conclusion that
if a wide variety of official news sources and official law
enforcement agencies don't seem to have a fucking clue as to
the time, date or sequence of events surrounding the murder,
the death of Cermak, the trial or the execution, then perhaps
one would be remiss in too hasty in accepting the same people's
conclusions that Roosevelt, and not Cermak, was the target, it
would be hard to fault their logic.
  As far as Roosevelt, or anyone else, being "the greatest
President" of any era, it would be more accurate to describe
their being the GreatestBullShitter of the era, or of having
the GreatestAdvertising/SpinDoctor/PoliticalThugs of the era.
  It is a matter of speculation to what extent Roosevelt's actions were responsible for the recovery of the American
economy after the collapse of the banking sector, but it is a matter of *fact*, supported by the testimony of even those
who were part of FDR's political entourage, that Roosevelt
took steps to ensure the *complete* collapse of America's
financial institutions while Hoover was still President,
in order to put himself in a position to extort as much
money and power as possible out of Congress.   Perhaps the massive suffering and financial losses that
he caused in his power-grab might be justified as being
'for the greater good,' except that, had he used his position
as President-elect to help restore confidence in the economy,
instead of destroying it, America would not have required
nearly as much 'saving' as it subsequently needed.
  It is a shame that I had not been born in an age when I
could have run for President against Roosevelt, and won.
  Had I done so, then I, like FDR, would have granted myself a license to print money, and I also would have
spent three times as much of the taxpayer's money as the
previous 31 Presidents, combined, but *I* would have spent
