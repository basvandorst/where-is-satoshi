->calling attention to the message BECAUSE it is encrypted? "If he went to
->the trouble of coding it, there MUST be something in there!!" Granted that
->if everyone begins encrypting, this problem will vanish... are there
->practical solutions in the meantime? (eg, Codes that look like plaintext?)
a good point indeed.  I know of no software that works the way it seems
you would like.  The best would be encryption software that makes your
'secret' message look like the kind of message that you would actually
be sending to the recipient.  Some kind of message that (when read by
a human) makes sense, and seems innocuous.  This sounds like a VERY
difficult problem, and one that is not likely to be solved any time soon
(in the sense of having this be done 100% by software).
Another option would be to have the message fit the letter-frequency,
letter-pair frequency, etc... that 'normal' messages have.  The idea
here is that messages may be scanned for unusual (i.e. non-english text)
properties in this regard, and then scanned further by humans and/or
computers in the order of their 'interestingness'.  So to defeat this
kind of scanning, your 'secret' message should 'appear' to be a 'ordinary'

->    The conclusions:
->    It is recommended to use encryption with 1024 bit key length.
->    The using of electronic  signature  is  not  recommended  and
->    requires the additional study.
->    The block encryption algorithm has temporary stability.
->    The hashing function  should  be  reduce  in conformity with ISO

->    The using of PGP program in actual version is undesired.

these are serious claims.  What do the authors of the software have
to say about them?  Others?

->For those who are interested, there is a short article in today's ->(14/1/93) New Scientist explaining how quantum uncertainties can be used ->to improve the security of exchanging cryptographic keys.
Scientific American had this quite recently also.  Or at least
something very like it.  I haven't seen the New Scientist article.
If anyone has it in GIF, TIFF, ASCII or PostScript format, I'd
like to see it.

As I wasn't able to attend this meeting (for obvious geographic reasons)
I did the next best thing (and urge every concerned list member to do
the same):
I gave my elected goons^h^h^h^h^hpoliticians a barrage of fax messages
on the subject.  If you don't have a fax modem, it's about time you get
one, it really is the best way to make your views heard by your
elected thugs (and to have them heard in your words, not summarized
like will happen when you call and give your message to their staff
by voice).  I write one leter, then select multiple (local) fax phone
 to send it to.  The program takes care of the rest.
(I use a multitech modem with a beta version of the windows print
capture fax software)
Get PGP22 before it becomes illegal!
