completed at my place of employment were very poor quality wise.  We
a %65 accuracy rate.  Not very good when you need to transfer a five
backlog of medical and technical journals.  This was using a high
scanner with a package that was bundled along with it.  About a year
my employer considered transfering data taken off of forms into a
database using an OCR program.  Again, we found the findings to be too
innacurate for our needs.  I may have just been using the wrong programs
the job, but the findings were depressing...
