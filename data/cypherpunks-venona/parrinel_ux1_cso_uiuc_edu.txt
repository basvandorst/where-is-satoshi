@_subject: Non-cypherpunk question. 
I just started reading this mailing list and I've run into a few problems
reading some of the messages because they include MIME information
which my copy of MH chokes on for some reason. It doesn't like the x-text
and text/x-pgp content-types. Would anybody on this list have a fix for
that so I can continue to read this list with MH? Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance!

I think encrypting who the message is from and the subject would be
best that way I can have a subject of "Plans to Kill Pauly Shore"
after I decrypt the message.
For how the service should work, I think you should look into MIME. You can include encrypted text that will decrypt when you read it with
your mail program.

There are a bunch of extra newlines in your public key... I can't
add it to my keyring to use it...
