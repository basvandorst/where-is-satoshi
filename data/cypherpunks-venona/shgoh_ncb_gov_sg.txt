@_subject: Triple-DES controlled? 
Could someone confirm whether the US export restrictions apply to Triple-DES?  If so, are there exceptions as in the case of DES (e.g. for banking or financial applications).

@_subject: symmetric key algorithms 
Could anyone comment on the acceptability and reliability of the SAFER algorithm, in comparison with other algorithms such as IDEA,
Triple-DES, DES, RC4, ....  Has there been any comparison paper written on the pros and cons of the different symmetric key algorithms?
