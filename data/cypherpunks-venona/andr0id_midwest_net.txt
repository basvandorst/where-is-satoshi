Another "best way" is to make all calls that you want to be personal with
a cellular phone.  Most cellular systems don't send ANI and do not provide
any type of billing information to the phone company.  The number is also by
nature unlisted and the only way to get it is by you or the cellular carrier.  If the cellular carrier gives your number out without your
permision or a court order they are in BIG trouble..

I was speaking more secure in that the billing information is much harder to
get.  If someone had the time, money, and equipment to track a particular
person at a specific location making a cellular phone call from a given
number they would most likely already have the means of getting the
information an easier way.
I do agree that letting anyone other than yourself control your personal
information is bad!  It happens all to often.
At least 50% of the cellular carriers are not telco related.  Giving out
cellular numbers and names is a tabbo NONO for cellular carriers.  If
cellular customers start getting sales calls from a company that received a
list from a cellular carrier, the cellular carrier is obligated to refund
the customers bill for those calls if the customer complains becuase the
customer pays for calls comming or going.
I don't feel that cellular is completely private or secure but its getting
much better with the addition of digital cellular.  The problem with digital
is that the conversations are more secure but the information about the
people calling is not.  Digital cellular and PCS offers ANI and a bunch of
other identifying information.

At least I know that my cellular carrier is safe for now.  The phone company
in our area still can't handle ANI from the cellular switch.  The default
number for our carrier ends in 0000 which happens to be my number.  I get
calls every month from people with 800 numbers verifying what number this
was.  I have to explain that someone from our cellular system made a call to
their number but the bill defaults to mine.  Its no big deal since I work
for the cellular carrier though.  ;)

Most cellular systems still write billing tapes and send them to a clearing
house for proccessing.  It may take 2 or 3 days before a bill is updated.
Thats not including that it takes sometimes up to a month before your
roaming charges are recorded from all of the other cellular carriers.  Some
carriers have realtime billing but it still doesn't take into account roaming.
This obligation is uncurred mostly by the fact that cellular carriers HATE
to loose customers.  If refunding a few min. of air-time helps keep a
customer then they will.  Unlike the phone company, a threat to discontinue
service with a cellular carrier works well in getting your way.

I havn't seen any scanners that block the 900 MHz range.  Didn't think they
were blocking that.  There isn't any reason to. After all they don't block
the 49 MHz.
Most cellular phone like the Motorola and the NEC can scan cellular
channels.  Whats neat is that they require little or no modification.
They can scan through all cellular channels including control, pause on a
channel that has audio, and should signal level.  I've use the Novatel and Motorola phones to even force the transmit on my
phone on a channel that was already in conversation and create a three way
call.  Since the cellular system already proccessed the original MIN and ESN
of the calling party my ESN is never checked.  All of this without modifying
my phone internaly or adding a computer.  This type of stuff makes encryption needed.  More and more people are using
PCMCIA cellular modems for all kinds of transaction not realizing that
anyone can pretty much intercept and use that information.  Digital will
help in some ways but harm on others.
$49 bucks will buy you an upconverter that will enable any scanner that can
pick up the 400 MHz range to pickup cellular.

We use DDS in some of our Microwave equipment between sites.  I agree; but, if the information you are passing is truly that important
just use a landline phone.  Eliminate the possable "leak".
I'm not claiming that a landline phone is secure, but your cordless is
connected to it, so no matter how good your security is on the phone its no
longer secure once it leaves the base station and enters the landline.
Further encryption can be implemented but this requires equipment on both
ends.  Really aren't we trying to create the most secure methods of
information exchange with the least amount of cost?  I'm budget restricted
so PGP and the internet are more secure and cheaper for me than most other
means of comunication, so far. :)

Well when you listen into a spread spectrum conversation what you will hear
is open squelch white noise.  The spread spectrum radios that I know about
send information on several deffrent frequencies throughout the
conversation.  Unless you have a system to receive the encoding bit that
signal what frequency is next you can't easily find the next freqency before
it changes again.  This change happens several time a second.  The
information is "packet-like", that is why you are able to use so many spread
spectrum units at once.  Example, Lynx spread spectrum T1 information signal
(data) is combined with a high rate spreading code (chip sequence). A
multiplier performs the combination.  Because the spreading code is
pseudo-randomly generated, the combined signal occupies a significantly
expanded bandwidth with a lower uniform power density.  At the receiver, a
locally generated, synchronized replica of the spreading code recovers the
information signal, through a second multiplication.  The same code sequence
must be used in the transmitter and receiver to avoic losing the information. The coding is direct sequence, 16 x spreading rate, the number of codes is a
9 DIP switch selectable.
Intresting is taht the radio acquisition time is 500 msec, typical.  If this
a security hole I don't know.
Note this is typical of a Spread Spectrum Microwave radio, a lot of the same
applies to 900MHz T1 and cordless phones.  As soon as I have further info on
encryption of signal/Freq. destination I'll post it.

This would tend to make changing frequencies at high rates VERY hard. :)
Also it has no frequancy readout, so this means that if you know what freq.
you should be at it is hard to tune in that freq. without searching a little.                          Dr0id

Forgive me if this is a stupid question.
I'm using AT&T unix Version 5 release 3.2.2  ( UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2)
I have several simple scripts that are simple yet handle important realtime
call proccessing tasks and remote control operations.  These programs are my
programs but are running on a system that is dialed into by the vendor once
in a while.  Is there a way to encrypt a script yet still allow it to be runnable?  I
know that the simple answer is to write it in C and compile it but I don't
have the means of doing that at the moment.  (i.e. there is not compiler on
the system)
I thought of a few simple protections but they all involve decrypting before

Okay.  So what if serveral groups of computers, in public FTP directories,
allowed anonymous ftp uploads of "parts" of a file that would be construde
as bad content.  The only way to assemble the file is to download several
parts of it from serveral diffrent servers and assemble the file on your
system.  Thus the illegal file isn't illegal until its assembled.  Sorta
like switchblade knives.  Lots of places can sell the parts legally, they
just can't sell the assembled product.  Would the servers that contain
"parts" of the file be responsible for the content?

The problem with this comes when you start creating links between much
taller buildings like in San Fran.  Any give building over 30 stories might
sway a foot or so at any given time.  Combine that with the other building
and you might get a few feet of movement. (movement not including during an
