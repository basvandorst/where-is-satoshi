@_subject: [AUSTIN] Local Cypherpunks Meeting Saturday 
Here is your friendly reminder of the Austin Cypherpunks meeting
tomorrow, Saturday the 2nd.  We'll meet at the Central Market Cafe at
38th and Lamar at 6PM.  Topics include the video (I'll have a
camera!), ITAR relaxation, RC4 now being called PC1, how to duck the
CDA using crypto, hardware random number generators, and stuff like
that.  The meeting should go around 2 hours depending on the crowd,
and there is a Bookstop next door if you want to browse some reading
material later.
Look for the people with technical books and/or crypto-related shirts.
They will be us.
(I'm sending this to both austin-cpunks and cypherpunks.)

* I can see it now. Apartments full of geeks because the apartments * were originally built with 100BaseX to each place and a T3 in the * basement going direct to the local ISP.
* * Tack on another $200/month or whatever to the apartment cost ( geeks * can afford that for sure ) and one might end up having a pretty nice * online melrose place.
* * I wonder if anybody has done that yet...
Yes, it has already happened, although in a slightly different
context.  The Georgia Tech campus dormatories got wired with Ethernet
back in 1994, and there was quite a rush by the sizable geek
population to get dorm rooms in the buildings slated to get
installation first.  It worked out quite well, especially the privacy
aspects, as the dorm routers encrypted all packets so only the
intended Ethernet node could receive it (at least that is what they
said).  So, in this case it was only 10BaseT and gatech.edu as the ISP, but it
still was very neat.

Hi, Steven.  The Austin Cypherpunks are the ones working on this,
although the effort level has been low lately.  We were planning on
leveraging Austin's excellent public access facilities to produce the
video cheaply, but time constraints of the group's members got in the
Right now, we're mostly dependent on good scripts.  We have a few scenes
down, but we need more material to finish the work.  Editing will come,
but we need the basic script and footage now.

Strick in SF (strick did a hack last year to put S/KEY into
yak.net's POP server.  If you had that setup on your account, you
could give Mailmasher the one time password, and it would be none the
wiser when you were finished.  Of course, it would still be able to
make copies of all the mail in your inbox folder plus it could field a
denial of service attack by keeping the connection open, but it
wouldn't be able to relogin.

just on a firewalled shell account, so I can't get to  to
