The difference between this scheme and a shared-secret scheme (if I
understand this scheme correctly) is that Arcot's infrastructure gives
you non-repudiation -- the central server can't forge authenticated
messages from you -- and so it's suitable for transactions of value
in a way that a shared-secret scheme isn't.
