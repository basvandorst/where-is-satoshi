According to the website, there's no pool of passwords.  There's a
truncated hash that will catch most mistakes, but is useless as a test
criterion in a dictionary attack.  If you get the user's "public" key,
then you can do a dictionary attack.  The user's "public" key isn't
public, however; not even the user knows it.  If I'm understanding it
right, it's stored encrypted and the key is only given to a set of
predefined servers.  Prior relationship must exist; they admit that.

A knapsack is a container that can only hold so much of something.  You
have a collection of objects with a weight and/or volume and a value. You want to maximize the value.  Fractional knapsack problems concern
things like flour and sugar, that you can measure out a fractional unit
of.  In 0/1 knapsack problems, you have a collection of objects: either
you put in the TV or you don't; no half-TV's.
Quoting from _Introduction to Algorithms_ (Cormen, Leiserson, & Rivest),
'Dynamic programming, like the divide-and-conquer method, solves
problems by combining the solutions to subproblems. ("Programming" in
this context refers to a tabular method, not to writing computer code.)
... Divide-and-conquer algorithms partition the problem into independant
subproblems, solve the problems recursively, and then combine their
solutions to solve the original problem.  In contrast, dynamic
programming is applicable when the subproblems are not independent..."

P.S. If you're considering writing a cipher based on them, don't.  Every
knapsack-based encryption algorithm has been broken.
