@_subject: Legality of requiring credit cards? 
It's that wonderful season again, when all the assholes are out in
force, and people feel obligated to purchase merchandise to give to
each other.  For various reasons, I don't believe in credit cards, and
yet, trying to pay for something by personal check at the local
Hecht's, they either *require* a credit card, or go through the Nazi
check-warranty company Equifax.  However, it doesn't stop there...only
SOME departments seem to have this requirement (Electronics/Luggage
not requiring).  Is it legal to require credit cards?

Yes, and if I'd *ever* written a bad check, it would be a different
story.  The weasel there basically said that because I'd made
purchases there in the past few days, they tried to contact my bank on
a Sunday afternoon....  (No, I don't get it either)
But that still doesn't answer whether or not a credit card can be
requested when paying by check.

@_subject: Kill filing 
I used to have procmail shove messages from certain folks directly to
anything, so they ended up going to $MAILDIR/.in.garbage.  After
looking in there today, I'm glad to say that it's back to /dev/null,
with no regrets.
Of course, with the new moderated list, there shouldn't be too much
work for procmail, except for those folks who I personally feel aren't
worth reading...

It seems like Sprint's taking advantage of the tap on Newt's little
call there by advertising how Sprint Spectrum is private and no one
can listen in, with little "signal" graphics going from one SS phone
to another in DC...  Cute...

@_subject: Re: remailer-operators DEA agents? 
What [I believe] is being referred to is an incident where someone
seriously messed up the formatting on a message sent through a
remailer to the point where it ended up in a mailbox on the system as
opposed to the intended destination, at which point the operator of
the remailer (I can't recall off the top of my head who) reported to
remailer-operators that xyz was trying to send some
type of image file to someone  Not at all monitoring the
messages going through the remailer, just reporting something that was
so F.U.B.A.R. that the software couldn't figure out what was supposed
to happen.

Count it as   Sandy didn't pass my response to one of Vulis'
messages (asking for him to supply some evidence) to either list, and
e-mailed me, telling me about it.

I assume that since you're making this claim about Stronghold, you
have facts to back it up?
