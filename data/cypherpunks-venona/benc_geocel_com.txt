Any sort of Certificate authority based protocol is dumb.  It's like RSAC
charging 500 bucks for rating a web site.  Nothing anyone does on the web is
important enough to encrypt.  Anyway, as far as SSL goes...we've all heard about how proactive Netscape is
in preventing key comprimise.  Its too late.
