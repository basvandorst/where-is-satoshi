Translation: a more palatable term for "socialised medicine"
So why in the world do those crazy Canadians keep coming here for medical care, when they can get it from your compassionate bureaucrats? What could be their compulsion to spend money they don't need to spend? Charitable impulses toward our impoverished medical profession?
BTW, looking at historical costs of medical care and the level of government involvement, it is safe to say that the US has too much socialism in our medical system right now, and that it what's making the best system (ours) so expensive when it would not be otherwise.
*False.* It is cheaper for _SOME_, and more expensive for others (in terms of either money, or waiting with pain, or both) and has an _ultimately high cost [the death penalty] for still others, who are forced to wait for the "compassionate" bureaucrats [who naturally know more about what patients' bodies need than the patients do themselves] to give them permission to get medical care they would otherwise purchase before death.

Or how about if you launch a defective missile, GPS-guided, and the firing
circuitry just happens to be misprogrammed so that it won't detonate, and
the GPS module just happens to be very modular and easily recovered for
use in another project?
Maybe this missile could be carrying a crypto-CD, put there as a joke by
an unknown employee.

Just wondering how much of a problem "damaged keys" really are in
practice.  Is this something specific to Microsoft filesystems or
really cheap tape drives?  I've never seen that problem under Unix,
and something like a private RSA key doesn't change very often, so you
would expect to have encrypted copies of it on many backup tapes.
Or maybe this journalist, like most, doesn't know what the fuck he's
talking about?

If that were so, you could supply a proof, couldn't you?  Since you
can't, this "mathematical certainty" crap just proves you are a bozo.
Is this what you are trying to prove by sending all these messages,
that "some bozo really dislikes Tim May"?
Is there any substance to these attacks on Tim May?  Is there any
reason a disinterested reader of cypherpunks should distrust or
dislike Tim May?  What would you like us to conclude from these
seemingly false statements you keep making about him?
If Tim May really is a terrible person for some reason, why don't you
tell us why?  Are you not trying to get us to dislike Tim May?  Are
you just trying to drive people away from the cypherpunks mailing
list?  Would you be satisfied if everyone unsubscribed?  If Tim May

Exactly what pisses you off?
The message Blase posted implies that there are serious problems with
making "tamperproof" devices.  This sounds like good news to me, as it
makes it significantly harder for the government to realy on the
secrecy of encryption keys for "LEAF" packets.
If you think there is something incorrect or dishonest about the
announcement Blaze forwarded, I'd like to hear about it.  However, I'm
trying to follow your logic but can't figure it out.  You claim:
  1.  Blaze stole the work of others.
How can this be since he clearly attributed the message to
  2.  He's twisted the work to fit his corporate needs.
How does discrediting tamper-proof hardware fit the needs of AT&T?
  3.  Blaze is about to endorse the clipper chip in his next message.
Why would Blaze endorse a system he has already shown is flawed?
Anyway, since he hasn't endorsed the clipper chip yet, why can't we
wait and see what he does before attacking him?
