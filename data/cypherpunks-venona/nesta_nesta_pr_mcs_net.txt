@_subject: macros for Pine and PGP 
admin so I am wondering if there is a way i can automate PGP signing and decrypting and crypting mail with PINE, now with PINE I can choose emacs as my alternate editor and jump into emacs, and then use perhaps a PGP interface for Emacs then.  But the emacs macros would have to allow me to specify the save name, or keep it the same as the tmp file PINE assigns for outgoing compositions when I crypt them.  Also since PINE is MIMI supporting, is their MIMI support for PGP stuff yet?
I am sorry I am so behind on this shit, it's just that I only marginally bothered to keep up with the interface stuff for Unix machines since I never had a machine that I could safely work from to sign outgoing mail and posts.

One solution, or start of a solution, is to tell the user about the signature checks, and how to go about verifying them in teh README text file, that most users come to expect in a package of software.  Or perhaps add into the tar and zipped packagea  file called SIGNATURECHECK or something suitably obvious, as well as explaining it.  I believe most users expect the README file enough to look in it, at least skimming it.

put it int he file that pops up from the FTP server when you switch to that directory, am not sur what the file is called, but like when you switch to the pub/Linux directory on sunsite, it gives youa  rundown of what Linux is and all.  Then the person would hav to hack access to the FTp server to change that.  And I assume ti is easier for the maintaner of the FTp site to keep track of that one readme, then it is to keep track of the readmes in all the ppackages.

Not a paralyzing fear, but a definite feeling that action is neccesary now to either head it off, or provide for alternative forms of communication on the Net if it does come.  Thank goodness the cypherpunks have been working on crypto, it is at least deployed enough now that any attempt to control that would entail drastic measures, like REALLY drastic. rest of the net of these happenings, and to tell them to contact their legislators and such to try and stop it, or at least attempt to stop the hystericism that these articles will drum up in congress.  Perhaps someone will be kind enough to write "newsletter" or a post to be spread throught usenet and other BBS's and mailing lists(under control, not spamming or anything) that alerts people on what is happening, and what they can do about it. I am afraid I am to inexperienced as a writer of such things, I could do it, but i am sure that others here would do much better jobs of it, and thus influence mroe action from the people on the net. get on your boots fellas, load your guns too.

Bigots' Growing Use Of Computer Networks Assailed
The Simon Wiesenthal Center on 12-13-94 sent a letter to Prodigy protesting
bigots online messages of hate. Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the center decries
the growing use by hate groups. The Wiesenthal Center wants government
policing of the internet. They fear one-sided exposure of youths to white
supremacist messages. Civil libertarians and white supremacists say that
free speech should prevail. Marc Rotenburg of the Electronic Privacy Info
Center says that it's a difficult issue and that censorship and control are ver
inappropriate. White supremacist groups like the National Alliance and the
American Rennaisance can spread propaganda nationwide. These types of
hate groups are kept out of mainstream media and are thus short of funds.
Valerie Filds of West LA said she saw an anti latino diatribe on Prodigy that
plugged American Rennaisance of Louisville KY. She says she saw a message
that seemed to be from a white supremacist group. She says she saw one referring to the "Diary of Anne Frank" as a "Jewish Hoax". The Wiesenthal cente
wants such messages deleted. Anti-semitic comments on Prodigy in 1991
resulted in a policy prohibiting "blatant expressions of hatred". Kevin Strom,
who produces a radio show for National Alliance, said he was recently blocked
from forums on Compuserve. He said that "the system operator decided we
didn't deserve free speech."  His article "The Wisdom of Henry Ford" about the
book "The International Jew" was downloaded 120 times. Georgia Griffith of
Compuserve said "we are not oblidged to publish it for him."  There are 5 m
subscribers to commercial online services, 2 m to Prodigy, 20 m accessing
the internet.  Rabbi Cooper wants the FCC to place a cop on the internet. White supremacist propaganda is available on the internet. The Institute for
Historical Review's article "Frequently Asked Questions about National Socialis
is available. Far-right activists say anonymity removes inhibitions too. The National Alliance uses Netcom Online Communications Services in California.
Texts and promotions of its radio show are available there. National Alliance
chairman William Pierce said "The major media in this country are very biased
against our political point of view. They present us with ridicule or in a very
distorted way. The information superhighway is much more free of censorship."

After reading the post from teh Scientologists about lockout out groups form anon-remailers, I was thining a little bit, note I said a little bit this isnt a fully fleshed out idea yet.  I was thinking it may be smart for osme of the remailers to lock out the groups, in particular those operators who do it forma student acount, or perhaps from their own account in teh United states where legal action would be able to reach them.  But to get around this, the anon users can use the Finland server, or a new and imporoved anon-remailer.  By shopping around for ISPs it is possible to find a provider who takes payment thru mail and doesnt require positive ID to set up an account.  With this you then either run that account as the remailer, a totally anon account not linked to your person and thus immune from legal actions(besies having it closed by the ISP if they are pressured) or you can run a SLIP connection and runa  remailer much like Julf's on your own machien thru a dedicated SLIP line. i want to know everything          i want to be everywhere                     Nesta's Home Page        i want to fuck everyone in the world               &

ten is not a large number when it comes o cross-posting on soem topics, I can think of at lezast tewenty newsgroups where the PRZ letters and such would make alot of sense and be on topic.  This just goes to show the soemtimes reactionar steps people take to control spamming.  it leads to people getting hurt, especially whent he sysop at your site is nto intelligent enough to look aat the article, and see wether or not it was cross-posted to valid groups etc..and not only that, but to completely pull your account for such a small thing(ten groups?  that's nothing in comparison to some aticles out there still going) What is the name of the sysop at that site your account was pulled form?  I agree, ten groups is a small amount, especially if they are at least amrginally on topic.  This is soemthing that we need to watch out for tho, it makes people fearful of spreadung information, when evenif you spread it in a nice manner, to on-topic groups etc.. that you face the chance of some bozo net-vigilante complaining to your sysop and having your account yanked. From teh evidence here it seems the sysop acted in a reactionary manner, probably out of fear of some asshole mailbombing your account.  I heartily reccomend that those of you who do not know your sites policies for such, become aquainted with them, or at least contact the syspo and talk about this issue.  If you contact him and talk to him(her) about it then they are less likely to react so quickly and IMO stupidly.  It's amazing how much just knowing your sysops first name helps in such a As for MCs, I am not sure of their policies but Karl is very reliable, and I doubt he would be so reactionary, in any case, I'll contact him about such policies.

Perhaps if Carol would post a well thoguth out and written article on what happened, instead of posting a thousand little "me toos" and "told ya so's" and such, this wouldn't be so annoying.  rough estimate of mine is that she is repsonsible for 30 some percent of the traffic on cypherpunks at this time.
Worse par tis that because i recieve my mail thru a SLIP lin which is admittedly slow, I still have to recieve all noise messages thru my SLIP link before procmail can trash/delete/redirect them.  SO now taking this into consideration, it seems that Carol Ann is responsible for more thruput on my SLIP link the myself, since mostly I recive mail thru it.

I agree with tim when it comes to the experimental stage of a project.

I myself see nothing wrong with selectivly choosing your users at this juncture.  With an experimental server that wouldn't have the back-up to protect itself fomr attacks in real-space(police feds guns dogs fundies) you DO need to be careful.  If you wanna turn this into a profit thing(which is possible) you then would get to choose your clients.  I guess what I meant o say in tha tlast letter, was directed towards a full-fledged, well established and backed DataHaven that was not run for profit, but rather as a service to help the public(yeah, I know this lists idea on those projects, I wont go that direction no more) and thus would need to be open liek that.
Well for an experiemnt that is fine, and I don't see it then much mroe then a listerv file service with encryption, unless i am missing something in teh DataHaven you have planned.  But later on when you wanna get serious and shit, you could get better shielding then that, depending on how much money you wanna spend.  Everythign from offshore sites with sattelite feeds or radio feeds(encrypted of course) with physical securiy measures and such.
I would set one up if I had the code tha tmet my standards(I don't have time right now to write it myself, but maybe if this thread goes well i will be inspired enough to order a few pizzas and go for it).  Right now my connection is muc much too slow to allow such traffic.  This is somethign i have been doing some serious thinking about also.  I cn actually see it bieng possible for me to have a small scale experiemntal data haven up and running in the near future, acting not only as a drop box, but also as a storage place and database of obscure information.

This is something I have been doing seom writing on lately, teh idea of nets on top of nets, the almost fractal nature of networking of this scale and horizontal nature on the INternet.  A DatHaven, like I mentioned in another post, is a vauge name, it could be some hacker kid with a lot of space on his HD and a fast modem who hacks the local univeristy and installes term, riggin his term connection to allow FTP connections, or telnet connections, or it oculd be someone with a decent size dinvestor backing him up as he gets a site linked ot teh net from some Carribean Island, who collects and intercepts TRW and Equifax like data on credit transactions and shit like that, selling it to those about to invest in soemone or something and want more info on it.  OR maybe it's an elaborate set-up of mail aliases thru remailer chains and clearing stations that lead to data safe deposit boxes, where someone can leave a large amount of date anon, and then allow osmeone else to retrieve it anon also.  With suffiecient planning, coding and equipment a datahaven could perform almost all the ideas that Tim came up with in his cyphernomicon, from selling crdit info, to a data drop box, to a holding agent for anon transactions(can't remember proper term).

I like this too, it keeps the data safe not only in transit, but also on the site itself.  So I don't have to re-encrypt files, they are alredy crypted, and signed(another good bonus) by the sender or account holder.
depends on how it is encrypted, if they encrypt it too the datahaven, using your public key, that argument won't work, BUT if they are suing it as a anon drop box, then they can encypt it to another publik key of the recipient(an anon key of course) and oyu would never be abl to read it.  This is a good feature of a data-haven, one that may be able to produce profit int eh future if tha is a motive.
