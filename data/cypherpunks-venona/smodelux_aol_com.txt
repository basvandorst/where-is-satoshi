BFW HANDBOOK
Last Revised: 4.22.98
     BFW INTRODUCTION:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-          that take e-Wrestling seriously, and screw the critics.  Do you think you're a
tough guy?  Are you _brutal_?  Are you sure?  You can't be sure unless you
strut your stuff in the paragon of e-Wrestling fun, the BFW (Brute Force
Wrestling).  going to approach this federation a little differently.  No longer will you
see the 20k BORING as hell matches, we're going to keep them short, with the
occasional overdrive.  Now let me ask you, do you REALLY see 55 minute
matches on regular broadcasts such as RAW or Nitro?  I don't.  Maybe on a PPV, but
stretch our matches on PPVs a little.  Anywhoo, what will this short match
process result in?  Fewer late cards, I know you all love that.  updates, updates usually just have the same stuff anyway.  In fact, I
always skip to the rankings when I read an update.  We'll show you a good product with our
magazine.  In-depth articles, and must-read writing.  Do you think you're
up for it?  If so, fill out this application form, but remember, we can only fit
20 singles wrestler's and 10 tags on our roster.
But beware... those who enter shall never leave... for they will be
engulfed in
fun and excitement, and they'll never even shed the thought of leaving!
