A signature on your PGP public key is a personal guarantee from the
person who signed it that she has first-hand knowledge that the key's
userid accurately names the person who physically possesses the key
(i.e., the signature validates the binding between userid and person).
But you do not have a binding between your userid and your person,
because your userid is a pseudonym, and a pseudonym is a name not
bound to a person.
Unless you reveal your pseudonym to someone and identify yourself
according to the rules of the PGP Web of Trust, you should not be able
to get signatures on your PGP public key.

That's part of it, but the more important binding created by a
signature is the binding between the userid and the real person.
Without that binding, the binding between the key and the userid is
useless.  This is why photo-identification (i.e., a passport) a
required part of keysigning (unless the signer personally knows the
key's owner).  Sure signatures bind the userid to the key, but what
good is that to third parties if they can't be sure that the userid
accurately names the person who possesses that key?
When I meet you in person to hand you my key fingerprint, won't you
require me to identify myself in order that you can be sure the name
in the userid of my key is also the name of the person you are
meeting?  If you do, then you will have just validated the binding
between userid and real person.
Which is exactly why I can never sign the key of a pseudonymous
entity.  Because the entity is unwilling to prove to me that there is
a single real person who possesses the private half of his key.
I don't like the idea of an automaton possessing or signing PGP keys.
People sign other people's keys because only people have the need to
trust other people.  Automatons don't need to trust and they are not
the direct targets of trust.  This is the objection I had to Phil's
signing of the Betsi public key.  As an automaton, Betsi is only as
trustable as its human authors and adminstrators.  Yet Phil doesn't
know who those people may be in five or ten years.  Yes, people change
over time too, but not as quickly or as radically as an automaton can.
It's too easy to subvert an automaton for me to ever sign an
automaton's PGP key.

They are pretty simple.  Don't sign someone's PGP key unless you have
firsthand knowledge that it is their key.  Implicit in this knowledge
is the knowledge that they are accurately named by the userid on the
key.  This requires either that you have a significant personal
relationship with the key owner (i.e., long-time friend, lover, etc.)
or that you have seen a significant form of photo-id (i.e., their
passport).  You must also obtain the key fingerprint via a relatively
tamperproof channel (i.e., phone call (if you recognize their voice)
or personal meeting).
Yes, we might one day live in a world where every human interaction
takes place between pseudonyous entities that represent one or more
real people.  In such a world, there is no place for PGP's Web of
Trust.  Reputations will have to suffice.
It's less formal than, say, a central Certification Authority, but it
has some formalities that, if broken regularly and on a wide scale,
would render the Web of Trust ineffective.  Determining the identity
of the real person who owns the key you are signing is one of those

I would not sign a pseydonymous entity's key based soley on the
reputation of the entity.  How do I defend against a man-in-the-middle
attack -- how do I know I'm not signing the middle-man's key instead
of the entity's key?
With a real person, my defense is to use a tamperproof out-of-band
channel to verify the key fingerprint: a phone call (for a friend
whose voice I recognize) or a personal meeting with passports (for
someone I don't know very well).  How do I do that with a pseudonymous
entity?  I'd really like to know if it's possible to do.
I'm all in favor of pseudonymous entities building reputations, but I
think that the price of pseudonymity is the inability to be part of a
PGP-like Web of Trust.
