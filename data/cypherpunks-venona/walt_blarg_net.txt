A Windows 95 extension for encrypting files is now available from SoundCode, Inc.  Just right-mouse click on any file, provide a passphrase, and it's done.  Point 'n Crypt visually indicates that a file is encrypted, and optionally provides the encryptor's name for easy passphrase lookup.  Point 'n Crypt is FREE during the beta period (through 12/31/1996) and will list for $19.95.
Point 'n Crypt uses 40-bit DES-CBC (exportable), salted SHA passphrases, and conforms to PKCS  and PKCS For more info, check out

The focus for the current PnC offering is more privacy than security.  To avoid any issues of ITAR and export we chose to make the first version weak.  There will be future offerings that use stronger, non-exportable As for the posting, I have seen the occasional commercial post float through.  This will be the only time that the post will show up on Now if we can keep any long threads from getting kicked off (an all too common occurrence).  Perhaps replies could be taken to e-mail...

It seems to me that anything that's exportable is pretty damn useless, if
you really want to keep something secret.  Also... I kinda got the
impression that this list wasn't for silly commercial traffic?

There is no arguing that 40 bits is strong security.  I agree with that.
But we (Soundcode, and anyone else in the business of crypto) have to also look at things from the standpoint of market share and market size.  Exportability directly affects market size and weighs in fairly heavily.  (Which is why ITAR (oops, Commerce) restrictions bite).  Which is why the current offering is 40 bits.
As for security, the current release of PnC is primarily targetting privacy, not security.  They are two very similar but different approaches.  40 bits is sufficient to encrypt files and keep them away from friends, family and coworkers (unless you work at the NSA).  The point of Point 'n Crypt is to attempt to make encryption technology easily useable and widespread.  If anything you have is of such a nature that 40 bits isn't enough protection then by all means don't use PnC (at least not this version :).
As for your final point, I agree, some people are stupid.  But part of the purpose of being a cypherpunk (and SoundCode) is to educate those that can be educated.  Sometimes education just has to take pretty small steps...

40bit encryption isn't much security at all.  If you've got something
important enough to encrypt, then it's important enough to find a proper
encryption program.  Why would anyone buy this shit?
(That's a rhetorical question, of course; the answer is because some
people are stupid...)

Security through obscurity is no security at all.
As for PnC (actually, the scCryptoEngine beneath it), we get the 40 bits from the 56 bits by nulling out the high nybble of every other byte.

Would you mind telling us just how you expand the 40 key to the 56
bits needed for DES? (Security through obscurity has a bad rep on
this list). For many  methods of doing so, 40bit DES is NOT
secure against a motivated individual's attack.
