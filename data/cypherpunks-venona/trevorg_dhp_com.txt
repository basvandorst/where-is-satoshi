Oh, my dear Doctor, I do regret that I have forgotten to inform you that
last year, shortly after our sweet night together where you gave such good
head and let me inside your sweet, though untight ass, that I have tested
HIV positive.
I hope this doesn't inconvenience you much, and send my regards to your
sweet wife, whom I remember having a much tighter anus than your own - no
offense, but she is much tighter.  I hope this doesn't influence your
feelings about me, and I hope that next time you drop by my home in Fire
Island that you bring her along to share our bed.
Oh, and next time I want you to stay the whole weekend; one night stands
are fun, but waking up in an empty bed is not my idea of a good lay.
With love,
 -- Trevor.

And on that rare occasion, my dear Doctor, why did you email those 1400
addresses directly?  Perhaps you would like to share that with the rest of

Dimi Vulis is just another garden variety KGB whore that has been misusing its `manhole' so badly that the overstretched sphincter cannot hold back the shit that all KGB spooks are full of and it spills out onto this mailing list.

It is quite humorous to see that our beloved list is so populated by these
so called doctors.  For a while we have had a Doctor Grubor, previously, a
Doctor Vulis, and now we are blessed by this Doctor.
Will the tentacles of Vulis never cease blessing us?
(Strangely enough I didn't think Vulis was into Indian metaphysics.  "Dr.
Jai Maharaj" has an extensive page on the topic.  Aparently this creature
professes to be an astrologer.  I wonder if the rumours that our beloved drs are pedophiles and are
involved in a child trafficking ring.  Supposedly, Dr. Grubor flies small
boys between the ages of two and six between Dr. Vulis's residence in New
York, and Dr. Maharaj's residence in Hawaii.  All three are known
cocksuckers of course.
The hidden protected areas of his web site which my Breen agents have
infiltrated show that Dr. Majaras uses the anal juices of his child
victims to predict the future...  Scum like this cannot be tolerated.  It
also shows much colaboration between the three.
I strongly suggest we "boy"cott this dastardly threesome.

Hey Tim, speaking of DejaNews, how soon do you think it will be before
there is a Ministry of Truth (minitru) in place to correct incorrect
postings of the past, to update them a bit and airbrush out those who, um,  never existed?
No bigger a threat than the HUAC saw those who didn't believe the Hoover
vision.  Nothing's really changed since then other than the faces and the  names.  The issues remain.
A theat to him perhaps.  What ever happened to self defense I wonder?     Not unless he joins the book people in the woods. :)
Congress was indeed a horrid idea.  We need no laws other that "do what
you will as long as you don't physically injure, or steal."  All else is
congressional bullshit paid in bloody tax money.
A few years back when the anti-gun crap started in NYC, they had all sorts
of save the kids propaganda stories and projects: such as trade your gun
for a toy, and stories like 8 year old shot dead by drug deal for
threatening to use water pistol.
Some war.  We've already lost.  The Big Brother machine is already in
place and has been since Hoover.  Jim Bell was arrested for thinking
differently than is allowed.  No different than being declared insane and
sent to the Gulag for "re-education" for disagreement with the party, the  glorious party.  Not having lived in communist or fascist countries, the
sheeple are asleep.
My parents having left a socialist state (read fascist) for freedom, I
find freedom fleeting.  The same scum that ran the communist block are
here running our country.  Sure they were born here, but their spirit and beliefs are the same as the scum that were in power in the old country.   How much money are we to bleed to them in taxes (read plural, as in
income, realestate, hotel, parking, gas and electric, telephone, taxes on
tax returns, etc.)?  How soon before breathing taxes? Fucking Taxes?
Living Taxes?  Speaking Taxes?  Let's not pretend.  We work for them.
It's mandatory work.  Our work pays their goals.  Doesn't matter if you
work for Mickey D's or Mickey Soft.  You pay Big Uncle.  You work for Big
Uncle's benefit.  It's not enough to fear Big Uncle.  You must love big   uncle.  One may not even hold anti-government views for fear of being in
contempt of court and be judged against.
How soon before they stop teaching highschool kids about the revolution
for fear it will happen again?  How soon before they edit the constitution
and pretend it was always that way?  How soon before we'll need passports
to travel between one part of the country and another?  Between one 'burb
to another?
How soon before we have to register every computer out there?  How soon
before we have to register every phone and phone card?  Every pencil and   knife and fork and other sharp objects? How soon before night curfews?
How soon before Victory Coffee and Gin?  How soon to food rations?  How
soon to electricity rations and water rations and net access rations? How
soon before ex-communist Russia has more freedom than we?
They've already silenced us, they've already taken our guns, they've
already thrown us in jail for feeding others, for speaking, thinking and  protesting, and demanding privacy, they've already stripped our privacy,   they've already murdered us, they've already licensed everything we can do and can't, they've already filled the streets with jackbooted gun and
nightstick toting thugs who wear blue and use bathroom plungers as means
of interrogation.
What next?  And how soon?
