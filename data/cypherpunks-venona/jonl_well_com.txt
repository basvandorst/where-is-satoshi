   R.U. Sirius and St. Jude were at the cutting edge of cyberactivism
   while editing Mondo 2000, among the first publications to acknowledge
   issues of privacy, cryptography, access, and censorship online. More
   recently they've created The Mutate Project, a spinoff from their
   "anti-novel" How to Mutate and Take Over the World, a semifictional
   work passing revolutionary memes and supporting opposition to whatever
   oppressive forces might serve to clamp down on the Temporary
   Autonomous Zone of the Internet. They'd prefer a full-bore Permanent
   Autonomous Zone.

                   in WiredSide Chat
                   Senator Conrad Burns (R-Montana) has recently
                   introduced legislation to make it easier for
                   netizens to get strong, easy-to-use privacy and
                   security tools for the Internet. The Pro-CODE bill
                   (S. 1726) aims a silver bullet straight at the heart
                   of the Clinton administration's unworkable
                   Clipper and Clipper II schemes by rolling back
                   Cold War-era regulations on the export of strong
                   cryptography. Join us Monday, 13 May at 6 p.m.

A good representation of postmodern paranoia...the ingredients: a mind
somewhat boggled by the extent of change (and the extent of awareness of

the fragile interdependence of control systems, and (this is the clincher)
an inability to trust the intentions of the vast conspiratorial World Outside.

Not necessarily. The character of the anonymous speech is decisive. If you
use anonymity to cloak harassment, for instance, the anonymity (which
removes accountability) is a problem.  The accountability issue is real and
should be addressed, not evaded.

Yeah, the main point re. anonymity, IMO, is that you can't pretend that it's
all pro, no con. You have to acknowledge and think through the
negatives...and, as Tim May pointed out, that's already been done.
I don't think you oughtta ream somebody for pointing to the down side. That
you raise an issue should never be taken to imply that you've taken a
position, and it's vital to remain open to discussion and entertain
sentiments that oppose your own thinking.

The terms "responsibility" and "accountability" are misused, which is
unfortunate, since I think we'd all argue in favor of taking responsibility
for our speech/actions in a positive sense. The negative is in asking me to
sacrifice my freedom because some few behave irresponsibly. This is like
setting an illogical default, assuming that it's a preventive, but it
prevents nothing.
Getting beyond this discussion of EFF, has any global entity discussed
making remailers illegal?

The harassment is one problem, the lack of accountability another. Which is
not to say that 'lack of accountability' should be 'fixed' by some sort of
blanket restriction...but it should be acknowledged as a problem.

Could be a lack of understanding of the possibility of authentication, which

I wouldn't exactly say that...but it's more of a personal responsibility
thing. Our model should be default acceptance of responsibility for words
and deeds, but I see that as a personal issue, not a matter for 'enforcement.'

The semantic point is a good one, but I'd like to see an example of a
situation where you don't think you should take responsibility for something
you've said or done. I'm not sure whether we agree or not on that one...it
could be we're coming from different dimensions...
Well, we all know what the Borg think. I probably should have said
'governments' rather than 'global entities.'
My real question is whether there is a real rather than possible legislative
threat that demands action now.

The real problem, to me, is that the remailer operator might be required to
breach anonymity; cf the decision in Finland that led Julf to squash

Seriously, the problem here is that you don't want to set up the stereotype
you allude to further down ('don't trust anyone over 30'). Stereotypic
thinking, ya know? Besides which, I've run into some real dorks who were
UNDER 30...
Hmmmmm...are Dyson and Kapor really net.doomsayers? I really haven't heard
any kinda doom and gloom from those two...
... and I've tended to think Metcalfe was just sending an 'ad absurdum'
flare when he predicted the death of the Internet, not so much predicting as
taking an impact analysis to the extreme.
I'm not sure which comments you're referring to, but I've come to understand
that the generation-gap thing has no pat answer.  Dave Farber is younger
than Bruce Taylor, if ya know what I mean...and there are plenty of old
pharts who are active in the various movements and groups opposing any
restriction of the Internet.
I dunno. Consider this: almost 30 years ago a bunch of us were more or less
active in left wing politics that had some of the same aims I see expressed
on this list and elsewhere, and we made mistakes. I don't know that I
learned from my mistakes the way you're sposed to, but some folks learned,
and are trying not to fuck up again.
On the other hand, some folks really are just stodgy, but I bet they were
stodgy kids, too.
Heh, right. Feet tall.

One of the realities of politics is that every gain for the opposition
contributes to a critical mass that can result in eventual passage of 'bad'
legislation. Though I tend to be pragmatic, I'm concerned that we tend to
give away too much early on in the legislative process.  Considering that
there is substantial opposition (by attorneys, professors, and corporations
as well as by crypto-anarchists) to crypto restrictions on the table, we
hurt ourselves if we declare a partial win as anything but a loss at this
point. Consider that crypto is hard to grasp for many, and we may be
feeding complacency with  unrealistic claims of victory.
