Build it overseas where there are no restrictions and then import it. Just
like almost every other component in a computer.

Didn't Netscape already promise to remove the hooks? It seems to me all of
the major software players are already in bed with the government.

I mean they planned to have some type of crypto, but then after a visit
from the USG, they removed that plan, and even withdrew the interface so
that someone else couldn't "drop in" the crypto. The press release
describing it was within the past 12 months or so. I will find it

Yes, I guess that was it. Thanks for the correction. Anyway, moving to the
actual point, it does seem most major software players are agreeing to the
USG demands.

Can you provide a source for this? Franklin was known to use encryption,
and the quote has been attributed to Stimson and no one else for years. I
really doubt Franklin was naive enough to think that the British government
were gentlemanly enough to respect his privacy.

Nothing has really changed. During orientation, you are told to keep your
NSA affiliation low key. But you are not ordered to. This was part of the
No Such Agency stuff, trying not to draw attention to yourself or the
Agency, and to avoid questions from the curious. Perhaps the most important
reason for keeping it low key though, was to preserve your career
options. But for disciplines such as crypto, the choices are quite limited
so broadcasting you are NSA does not matter much.

No, it is a civilian organization within the DOD. The CIA is a civilian
organization outside of the DOD. Although it appears Deutch is trying to
change all of that as we speak, and Inman wants to abolish the CIA

I do not see anything funny, but you are at odds with the Constitution,
where the people have granted the government certain rights that they have
not granted to themselves. But it seems we may be making progress at
getting those rights ourselves.

They have been downsizing for almost 4 years now. Not just people, but
budget and mission priorities too. I would imagine they are smaller now
than they were in 1980.

Actually, she did try to get music censorship. When that failed, she
settled for labelling.

Yeah, I got his name but was not sure of the spelling. Robert Steven
something. Lives in Millersville, PA. I think he is retired. Looks like a
victim of the cozying relationship between the FBI and the KGB-whatever
they call themselves nowadays.

I disagree with this, and think that in the next 10-25 years we will find
that most of the systems we are using today were as easily broken as the
systems of yester-year (Enigma, Japanese Codes ,etc).

Has the product actually been evaluated and put on the EPL? Or is Microsoft just claiming it meets the C2 requirements?
