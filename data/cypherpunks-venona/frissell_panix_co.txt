Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 17-Jun-96 Re: Remailer Operator
Liabi.. by Duncan Frissell I believe we used the term "email exploder" instead of "mailing list,"
particularly in cross-examination and closing arguments, to convey the
idea that such a device is often used for conversation, not just one-way
The fight-censorship list (mail exploder?) is part of the lawsuit, and
my sworn testimony included:
  the list sometimes includes material that could be considered
"indecent" or   "patently offensive."  Minors are not excluded from this

Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 5-Jul-96 Re: I confess [Was: Who
was.. by Duncan Frissell I was sitting not far from Jim when he offered the amendment; I remember
it passing overwhelmingly. However, I don't think think the word "GAK"

The change to the platform, including Jim's amendment, passed unanimously.
