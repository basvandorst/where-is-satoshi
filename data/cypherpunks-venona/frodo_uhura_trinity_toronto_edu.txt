All lines between this and the PGP header may be suspect.
This is what I posted to Ont.general this evening. Those who
are interested in getting more information about the
kerfuffle in Toronto over the posting through an anonymous
remailer might want to check out
    (I believe that's it. You might want to try without

the discussion going through the newsgroups, and the Globe

The article below is what I posted to ont.general myself
this evening. Seemed a good chance to proselytize... ;) It
was signed, as below, with my shame-facedly new PGP key,
though the signature file was slightly different. (I've

fact that there are already ways of protecting yourself
from misrepresentation on the net.
The University of Toronto's CDF facility is currently
having a little problem with sending mail (ie, it
can't), so I'm posting this instead of sending it
directly to Bob Rae. Perhaps we should send him PGP for
