I don't necessarily want to support "socialism" nor "capitalism". Both
are extremes of a situation which does no one any good to exist. However, I would question the implication that "socialists" are
responsible for the higher tax rates you currently experience.  For example, I could make a strong case that you really have some

@_subject: cypher-PUNKS... 
I am writing this post to inform subcsribers of this list of the problems I have seen in this service.  The number one problem being off subject discussion

more cypher and a lot less punk.  I can understand how it can all get started
One person posts some intelligent information.  Then another replys dissagreeing
with the original sender.  Then the sender takes it personally, and feels a need

information.  Logos take a chill pill.  You aren't a policeman.   Tim May, do you have anything on subject to discuss?

I have a heard of a new encryption style called something like "Zone-redundant"
and I was hoping if someone had any information on it?  I think it is based on
encrypting random pieces of encrypted data, but since I have very VERY little
knowledge of the subject (hoping to learn a little from this mailer) I'm not
sure.  Does anyone have more information on the subject?

p.s. Logos, Tim May nothing personal, I hope.
