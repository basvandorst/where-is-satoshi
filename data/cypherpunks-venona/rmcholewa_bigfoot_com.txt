@_subject: RE: NT 
Yes, that's easy...
Just drop it from a 1 meter down straight fall... :-)))
... or simply run DELPART and erase any partitions on the disks...
... or install a separate copy of NT in another folder and run deltree
... or go into \CONFIG and delete the registry
There are a thousand ways to acomplish that... can you be more specific ?
