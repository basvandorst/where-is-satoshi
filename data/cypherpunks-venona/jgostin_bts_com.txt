     For me, "reasonable amount of time" translates into "the minimum
amount of time neccessary to elapse before the information gained loses
its sensitive or critical value." In other words, if I encrypted some
rather embarrassing letters that I wanted to keep, but also wanted to keep
safe, the "reasonable amount of time" would be as long as it takes for me
to die, plus one day. If it's a "state secret", it might be 100 years.
