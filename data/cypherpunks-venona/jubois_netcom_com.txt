Interesting recycled bits from Newsbytes concerning a BBC story drawn from
Usenet: BBC Blows Radiopager Security Systems Wide Open
LONDON, ENGLAND, 1996 OCT 2 (NB) -- By Steve Gold. The
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has revealed that radiopaging
messages on the UK's paging networks can be read by anyone with a
radio scanner and suitable PC software. In addition, the British TV
company claims that it is also possible to insert bogus messages onto
the paging networks using instructions on the Internet. ... BBC journalists, meanwhile, said that UK radiopaging
transmissions were unencrypted and, as such, were insecure when viewed
alongside digital cellular phones, where signals are encrypted.  ...the BBC claimed it had been shown messages
reporting on the activities of Tony Blair, the head of the British
Labor Party, along with a message referring to a residence of a member
of Royalty.
Newsbytes noted that the same system is used in the US.

@_subject: pgp, edi, s/mime 
Interesting comments from a member of the IETF EDI-INT group, which is
developing standards for secure EDI over the net, and managing a Commercenet
pilot project:
- S/MIME and PGP are the two leading candidates for encrypting EDI messages,
S/MIME inside the US, and PGP outside the US where S/MIME is unavailable.  - If PGP 3.0 comes out on time with promised features, it could gain
adoption by large companies as a standard means of encrypting EDI messages;
that would pull smaller companies along, but it has a narrow window of
opportunity and could lose to S/MIME products like those from Deming. - The G7 governments will impose key escrow on large companies trading over
the net, and while non-escrowed systems will continue to be available, they
are likely to be illegal, and certainly will be marginalized.

The numbers quoted in the press were based on a study by the Cato Institute,
"The Work Welfare Trade-Off: An Analysis of the Total Level of Welfare
Benefits by the State" by Michael Tanner, Stephen Moore, and David Hartman,
September, 1995.  It's at .  Extracts: * To match the value of welfare benefits, a mother with two children would
have to earn as much as $36,400 in Hawaii or as little as $11,500 in
* In New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, the District of Columbia,
Hawaii, Alaska, and Rhode Island, welfare pays more than a $12.00-an-hour
job--or more than two and a half times the minimum wage. * In 40 states welfare pays more than an $8.00-an-hour job. In 17 states
the welfare package is more generous than a $10.00-an-hour job.
* Welfare benefits are especially generous in large cities. Welfare
provides the equivalent of an hourly pretax wage of $14.75 in New York
City, $12.45 in Philadelphia, $11.35 in Baltimore, and $10.90 in Detroit.
* In 9 states welfare pays more than the average first-year salary for a
teacher. In 29 states it pays more than the average starting salary for a
secretary. In 47 states welfare pays more than a janitor earns. Indeed, in
the 6 most generous states, benefits exceed the entry-level salary for a
computer programmer.
