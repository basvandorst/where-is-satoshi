Let me know if I can be of any assistance.  I'm no UNIX guru, but I
can find my way around, and I can "hack"(literally! :-) ) HMTL (I use
the HotDog HTML editor).  I've been lurking around the list for awhile
now, and this looks like a good opportunity to be "of service".  Just
let me know, or reply if you have any questions.  Thanks.
