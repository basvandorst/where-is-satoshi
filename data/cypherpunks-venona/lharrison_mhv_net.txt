There has been a thought that's been in the back of my mind while reading

such as Klick 5-1234.  Later, they went to all numbers, i.e., 555-1234.
People balked, but they eventually got used to it.  There are other examples

but getting domain names - doesn't it seem likely that, at some point, only
IP addresses will be left (or dumb domain names like   Ergo, what is the problem with having a numerical URL?  After all, some

1.  Creating a separate list, IMHO, will not stop cross-posts to the list.
People will merely add one more list to their "cc" line.
2.  More importantly, I am troubled with the "this is OUR list" attitude
that some people have expressed.  Yes, it is a pain when their are
cross-posts that are completely off-topic but, as Adam correctly points out,
some are interesting and relevant.
    One of the tenets proposed by those on this list is free speech.  Most
of us are on more than one list, so I'm assuming that most of us receive
100+ messages a day.  It is irritating to read something that's been crossed
to c|punks that has nothing to do with this list.  However, it only takes a
few seconds to arrive at that conclusion and trash the post.
    The "they are targeting this list" borders almost on paranoia.  While
some paranoia is healthy :) - it should not lead to the cry to ban posts
that have been *deemed* to be inappropriate.
    I find it interesting that those who express that the net should be a
community where expression is to be encouraged and defended - until the time
arrives when such "unsolicited/unwanted/offensive/irrelevant" expression
knocks on one's front door.

This morning we filed the lawsuit in Philadelphia.  Judge Buckwalter,
to whom the lawsuit was assigned, held a hearing this afternoon on our
motion for a temporary restraining order to prohibit enforcement of
the Act.  The Government agreed at argument not to enforce the
"indecent" and "patently offensive" provisions of the Act for 7 days. We count this as a victory.
However, the Government did not agree not to eventually prosecute
for material available during the next 7 days.  Thus, we believe
there is still a risk.  With regard to the abortion provisions, the
Government conceded that they are unconstitutional and will not be
enforced.  We will not be satisfied on this matter until they so
stipulate in writing.  The Judge gave the Government until Wednesday
to respond in writing to our motion.  He will then rule on our

Agreed.  As we all know, tax evasion charges have been used by the IRS when
the FBI has felt that it is unable to prove other charges.  Its use against
organized crime is a prime example.
While I do not practice in Fed'l courts, in state courts the specific statute
that a defendant is accused of violating must be cited.  Hence, since I am
not familiar with federal complaints, I did note with curiousity that Bell's
complaint specifically cites statutes that Bell allegedly violated regarding
the SS number charges and the failure to file income tax returns.  Perhaps,
the other acts, wherein no specific statutes are alleged to have been
violated, are mentioned as a means to make a showing that Bell is a danger to

matter may very well be resolved via a plea bargain.

Danish software firm finds flaw that could let sites see data stored on PCs                           From Correspondent Steve Young
                          June 12, 1997: 6:58 p.m. ET
                 NEW YORK (CNNfn) - A serious new flaw
                 that affects all versions of Netscape
                 Communications Corp.'s popular Navigator
                 Internet browser software -- including the final
                 test version of its Communicator Suite released
                 Wednesday -- has been uncovered by a Danish
                 software firm, CNNfn has learned.                  The bug was reported by Cabocomm, a
                 software company located about 100 miles west
                 of Copenhagen, Denmark. The bug makes it
                 possible for Web-site operators to read anything
                 stored on the hard drive of a PC logged on to
                 the Web site.
                 After the firm reported the bug to CNN
                 Financial News, CNNfn and PC Magazine
                 tested the bug by creating and storing a
                 document on a PC's hard drive in New York.
                 Seconds later, the Danish company read it.                  As further proof, CNNfn and PC Magazine
                 created another document which the Danish
                 company was also able to read.
                 Larry Seltzer, technical director of PC Labs,
                 was among those who helped verify the bug
                 report. He said it would take a somewhat savvy
                 computer user to exploit the bug.
                 "They have to be seeking information from your
                 system and they also have to know the file
                 name. It's not that hard for somebody who's
                 looking to make trouble, but they do have to be
                 looking for it," Seltzer said.
                 "It's serious in that it's in the [actual] browser
                 ...whereas previous bugs generally required the
                 user to have downloaded an additional product,"
                 Jim Wise, UNIX administrator for CNNfn, said.
                 CNNfn's test showed that Internet security
                 firewalls offer no protection from the bug.
                 Mike Homer, vice president of marketing for
                 Netscape, said the company takes this and all
                 bug reports seriously.                  The Danish company says the reward of $1,000
                 and a T-shirt is "insultingly low" considering the
                 extent to which the bug report is likely to worry
                 Netscape users.
                 Cabocomm said it would accept "reasonable
                 compensation" for the technical information -- or
                 they can send a Netscape representative to
                 Cabocomm and get it for free.
                 CNNfn, PC Magazine and the Danish company
                 will not release technical details on the bug until
                 Netscape has prepared a bug fix.
                 The reason CNNfn is not reporting the specifics
                 of the bug is to avoid anyone exploiting it.
                 Until the bug is fixed, confidential letters,
                 business spreadsheets -- everything on your PC
                 -- can potentially be pilfered.
                 The Danish company says it won't exploit the
                 bug, but has no idea if someone else has found
                 the same bug and is compromising a system's
                 integrity. Lynne L. Harrison, Esq.       |    "The key to life:

Reason for my asking is my questioning the veracity of the contents of the
email.  The mail specifically stated: "in previous court hearings [plural],
IRS Inspectors testified.."
Could've been a bail hearing although they are usually decided on motion
papers.  Additionally, there are no hearings for the request of a
search/arrest warrant - primarily because the request is ex parte.  Probable
cause is decided on annexed affidavits.
I'm also surprised that that JB's plea did not hit the local newspapers given
the initial coverage.  There's usually a follow-up report of the entry of a
guilty plea.
If JB did plea guilty, the next docket entry should reflect "for sentencing"
or words to that effect.

In my personal opinion (IMPO - see Disclaimer below), 47 USC 227 is the
closest statute that pertains to Question   The problem is that
unsolicited email, per the statute's definition, refers to unsolicited
commercial email.  OTOH, if I were to email you privately, it would
technically be unsolicited.  If you replied and requested that I
discontinue, and I persisted, then most states have laws
governing/precluding my behavior.
Question  is a thornier issue.  As we know, we can get lists of email
addresses from a variety of sources.  The "missive" was neither slanderous
nor untrue.  Additionally, the beginning of the message described it as a
press release.  To allege that it was a "warning message", one would have
to prove that, in fact, it was not a press release but, rather, it was
meant to be a warning to the recipients.
I question, however, if is proper/appropriate for a governmental entity to
retrieve email addresses off of a computer involved in a criminal matter
and use those addresses to send the type of message that was sent to a
selected few?  Unfortunately, I have no answer to this query.
Do any other individuals have any thoughts concerning this issue?
