@_subject: O(f(x)) 
The way *I* learned it was like this:
g(x) = o(f(x)) means that g(x)/f(x) -> 0 (as x goes to some specified limit)
g(x) = O(f(x)) means that |g(x)/f(x)| is bounded (as x goes to some limit)
In other words: a function that is o(f(x)) is of lower order than f(x), while a function that is O(f(x)) is of no higher order than f(x).
