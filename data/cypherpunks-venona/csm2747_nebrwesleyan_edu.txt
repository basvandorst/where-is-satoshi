@_subject: Remailers... 
Ok, Ok, I'll admit I'm a newbie to encryption and the like.  This idea
of remailers seems excellent.  My only question how do I use them?
Also where could I get more info about all this?  The ftp at
soda.berkeley looks like a good place to start...any suggestions on
specific files or programs, beside PGP.  Thanks.
