Hi folks,
 KB> Hey folks, passwords are hard to choose!
It is indeed a problem. I hear that grady recently posted some
useful info on this matter somewhere on UseNet, but I can't find it. I recall
having found an interesting article sometime last year, but I lost it. In
short, it said that pass phrases and such should be "shocking nonsense". The
"shocking" element will help you remember it, and the "nonsense" element will
make it difficult for others to guess it.

My pass phrase is a couple of words long and contains deliberate misspellings
and unusual capitalization. To be able to remember it, I simply use PGP every
day, even if there's nothing to sign or decrypt. ;-)
I'm a (long time) 2-finger typist but I have no problems with echo off.

Honestly, I wouldn't know. However, if you read FAQ's carefully as they are
posted to (amongst others) news.answers, there are some which mention CRAM, an
acronym used by Detweiler referring to a service he has for folks who don't
wish to be bothered to handle anything except the content of their FAQ.
In the blur with which those FAQ's end he always mentions his current email
address, and lately that has been tmp

How about Stanford's Netnews Filtering Service? Admittedly, I read about that
in alt.internet.services, but I'm sure there's a FAQ (like Scott Yanoff's)
which mentions it and which can be retrieved via email through e.g.
rtfm.mit.edu's mailserver or ftpmail

That count may not be accurate. There are sites with an abundance of
cypherpunks that turn the list into news, which makes transport (often over
UUCP links) more efficient.
