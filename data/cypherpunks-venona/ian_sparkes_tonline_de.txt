I've never seen perfect code before, I'd be interested to see some.
No, thank you

This has been widely used as a (very) local area network - you can find a number of Hobby-style projects in electronics magazines dating years back.
The transformers, which are designed for 50/60Hz, should look like brick walls to any carrier frequency that can cope with a meaningful bandwidth. This probably explains why it is local. Additionally, I have heard that the power companies tend to get uppity about even the local variant - apparently it impacts their supply monitoring.
But much cheaper and easier is using the signalling gulleys that run along the side of the railways - no High Tension precautions, no scaling pylons. This, incidently is the reason that a number of telecomms consortia (in europe, at least) include a railway element - they provide the long-haul backbone.
And that's the 'cheap & easy' mentioned above?

run element - Maybe in retrospect I was just tugging your leash a bit, for which I I agree, in principle there are few entities which are more aptly placed than the power utilities to provide a roots to leaves high-
capacity network into your home. Telephone companies could do it, although the very final stage in the link (twisted copper) is a capacitive load, and therefore not very well suited to high frequencies. Power wires, on the other hand, would exhibit better properties and are universally installed. The solution, however, must be a fibre/copper hybrid. The trick will be getting the bridges between fibre/copper and copper/copper (across the step-downs) cheap and reliable enough. This is probably the breakthrough.
The post from Judith Lewis seems to hint at about 0.5MB/s. Good enough for your average Joe.
Sorry for the obtuseness of my reply.
