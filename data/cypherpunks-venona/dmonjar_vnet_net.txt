@_subject: Hassles taking App. Crypt. to Taiwan? 
I've lurked for quite a while now.  It is time to ask my first newbie
question.  I'll be going to Taiwan for three weeks in March.  Is there likely to be any problems at US or Taiwan customs  if I take
Applied Cryptology 2/e along for personal study?
