I just found PGP 2.5 on a non-USA ftp site. I expect 2.6 will turn up there.

What if the European user obtains PGP 2.6 from a European site, then rips out
the RSAREF code, and makes it use Phil's original code from 2.3a, and then
distributes this copy. Is there still a copyright violation on RSADSI? Is there one on MIT ?
