Woah....  I hate to interject noise, but I have to comment.  Maybe      Bruce's reply WAS a bit curt and not terribly helpful.  But it's      better to just let it drop, and not resort to criticizing typos.  I'm      a member of this list in the hopes that I'll learn something.  While      it's true that I didn't learn anything from Bruce's reply, I don't      think anyone gains anything from grammar/spelling corrections!
