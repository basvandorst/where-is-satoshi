Can this be made a regular feature on the list? It will be helpful to discuss on the Internet companies are doing in the stock market. Also it would be interesting to see if any startups have a strong product to
survive in the market

@_subject: To find the clock speed of a sun workstation 
Is there anyway of finding the clock speed of the CPU on a Sun workstation?
As far as i know it can be found only by rebooting the machine and using
module-info? And I believe that the module-info does a no-op loop for a
a known number of times and calculates the time taken.
I would like to know if there is anyother way to finding it.

Actions of certain individual or group does not reflect what the actual
religion is. Examples of this can be found on every religion. Somebody generalizing as above reflects his/her own closed/blocked mentality.
Look at yourself, if you can fall to such degrading levels and since you happen to be a member of this mailing list, it is not ration to think as
every cpunks as demented as you are.
