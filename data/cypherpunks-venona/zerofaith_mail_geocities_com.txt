Would you like a decompiled version of the Monkey_B virus, because I have
over 6000 virii, including that one, if so, mail me personally. It corrupts
your boot sector, and sooner or later, deletes your files.

How come not everyone got it, did it depend on the x-mailer you are using?

Has anybody noticed that netscape 3.x has a bug that brings the last page
that I was on onto the next page that I go to, do I need to delete a history
file or something, or does anybody have the answer to resolving this problem.
