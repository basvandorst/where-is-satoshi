@_subject: Re: Extreme Left/Right 
:I always had trouble understanding what people meant when they used the :terms "extreme left" and "extreme right".  Then, about 4 months ago, I
:saw a guy define the "political spectrum" the way (he said) it used to be :defined before the definitions were corrupted (by whomever wants to :divide - and conquer - the people).  It made sense to me.  A spectrum :afterall, at least when we're talking about colors, starts with one type :of color and graduates to other, DIFFERENT colors.
:He defined the "political spectrum" as follows:
:< ------- LEFT                                                 RIGHT ------->
:            Monarchy      Oligarchy      Democracy      Republic      Anarchy
:Rule by:      ONE            FEW           MANY           LAW           NONE
:Examples:   Dictator,     Communist,      Lynch Mob     Constitutional
:            King          Fascist State                 Govt (US before
:                                                        1930's)
You forgot the property situation under each.
Anarchy: (IMO belongs left of monarchy, just to keep it mathematical)
           Ownership and distribution of product of ownership
              controlled by the strongest mob.
Monarchy:  Ownership by the one. Privileged few allowed to make use of
              it.
           Communist: No private ownership. Distribution of product by
              the state.
           Fascist: Private ownership allowed. Distribution of product
              by the state.
Democracy: Ownership and distribution by the loudest mob.
Republic:  Private ownership and private determination of
              distribution.
            (Major paradigm shift in governance - away from whims of
              one/few/many *people* to *objective laws*.)                   NOTE: Key word here is *objective* - not law. Whims
                        are subjective.
