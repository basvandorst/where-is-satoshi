Etc.  I've been using PGP for authenticating my packet messages for
some months, for precisely the reasons you outlined.  I get the
occasional "stop wasting bl**dy bandwidth" but most of the time it
results in more PGP users.  I'm also careful to explain that PGP can't
be used to prove I did NOT write an unsigned nasty-gram (until we get
true authentication within the BBS, by which I hope the concept of a
BBS will disappear :-) but it makes a strong case if I sign ALL my

And by now I've lost track of the original discussion, so I'm not sure
whether I am the one being referred to above (I'm the one who PGP signs
all his packet radio messages, in response to Bob Snyder saying he sees
no problem with this, and Bob replied saying he'd like to see it at the
link level), and it sort of diverged from there...
Given that the FCC (and other countries' equivalents) are starting to
crack down on packet radio abuse (it's all too easy to fake someone
else's callsign) I imagine it won't be long before we Amateurs are forced
to implement some form of authentication (down to the callsign i.e. the

Egad.  I suppose I shouldn't feel too annoyed that out of over fifty
copies of PGP (from the 2.3A days) I've distributed (at my own expense)
to radio amateurs in Australia (for authentication on packet radio),
with two lectures and an article in a national magazine, and
exhortations to call me about any problems, precisely two other people
are using it (but are not signing their messages); and these were
already crypto-aware to start with - sigh...
I'm not going to give up - at least my signature is generating enquiries.

That has nothing to do with it - person A wanted advice on how to invade
person B's privacy (he presumably doesn't have the guts to just ask her).
Sorry, but privacy works both ways - she's entitled to it just as much
as anybody else.

An extract from the Australian Constitution:

As are many other schools of various religious persuasions.  So?
It's not compulsory - as an avowed atheist I always avoided them.
Not necessarily...  If they fund one school, they can hardly refuse
to fund others.
Obviously - it's handy having an on-line copy of the Australian
Constitution.  Anyone want a copy?  I don't run an FTP site.
You might be amused to know that our Governor-General (the "Queen's Man")
is himself an avowed atheist - is it likely he would have been appointed
by a pro-religious government?
