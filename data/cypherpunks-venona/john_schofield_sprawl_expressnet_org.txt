@_subject: The thread that would not die.  (Mandating signatures) 
It is silly to talk of someone "owning" the list.  The list is a
community.  The only possible owners are the people in the community.  If we
all left, Eric would still have control over the list--but the list would be
    It is just as silly, though, to talk about whether or not Eric has the
"right" to enforce his ideas.  He *CAN* make changes to the list--anything
else is irrelevant.
    This whole discussion seems to be based on the idea that signing
everything is a Good Thing.  Yet I haven't seen a convincing argument for
that.  If I read a forged message, I haven't been hurt.  If the person being
impersonated doesn't exist, nobody has been harmed--and if he does, ONLY that
person has been harmed.
    So, let's put the onus here where it belongs.  If people feel their
reputations are important enough that they need to sign their messages, more
power to them.  If they don't feel it is important, who are you to tell them
the value of THEIR reputations?
    When signatures are easy enough to do, the scale will balance on the side
of security--people will value their reputations more than the trouble it
takes to sign messages.  Until then, people will not sign.
    For me, signing is easy--even though I am ridiculously unconnected right
now.  So I do it, using an off-line mail-reader shell that I wrote and
distributed myself.
    The list members who are convinced that digital signatures are valuable
could do much more to advance their cause by eliminating some of the barriers
to using digital signatures than by mandating them.
    Any type of a stick will not work very well in this situation.  The people
most interested in privacy and encryption are those who are by nature most
individualistic and stubborn.  Forcing them to do something will make most of
them go the other way, or go away.  I know my mind works that way.

@_subject: Steganography Software 
I am working on a review of the various steganography programs out there for
the March/April issue of Keep Out magazine.  I have a pretty good list of the
stuff that's available in the DOS world, but I may have missed plenty of stuff
available on the Internet.
If anyone is aware of later versions of these programs, or of a program not
listed here that should be, *please* let me know.  (Please include an FTP
site and directory and/or a BBS to download it from.)  I want this review to
be as complete and accurate as possible.
Questions, comments, and suggestions are of course welcome.
Here's everything I have so far, including partial descriptions:
HDSK41.ZIP     Hide and Seek v 4.1b.  Data hiding/seeking using GIF files.
JSTEGV4.ZIP    This version of the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG Software
               (release 4) has been modifed for 1-bit steganography in JFIF
               output files.
MANDLEXE.ZIP   MandelSteg V1.0, including GIFExtract V.10, for DOS.  These
               two programs allow you to hide confidential data in fractal
               GIF images.
PGE10B.ZIP     Pretty Good Envelope (P.G.E.) v1.0.  PGE will "insert" your
               data into a GIF or JPG file.
S-TOOLS.ZIP    S-Tools for Windows.  Version 2.00.  Steganography program
               for Windows.  S-Tools (Steganography Tools) brings you the
               capability of `hiding' files within Windows sound files
               (.WAV),  bitmap (.BMP) and CompuServe GIF files.
STEGO.ZIP      Send encrypted messages and files which are undetectible and
               REQUIRE NO KEY! Programs and messages are submerged into a
               graphic file (usually a B/W TIF file).  Once the object has
               been hidden the TIF appears unchanged.
STEGODOS.ZIP   StegoDos aka Black Wolf's Picture Encoder, Version 0.90b.
               For 320x200x256 only.
WNS210.ZIP     White Noise Storm: Data Encryption/Steganography package.
               You can use this to hide files in PCX pictures so nobody will
               see them.
Thanks very much!

@_subject: Keep Out Electronic Availability Announcement 
Keep Out
                  The Journal of Electronic Privacy
                           January 10, 1995
    ** Keep Out Volume 1, Number 2 now available electronically **
            ** Keep Out Volume 2, Number 1 coming soon **
                  ** FREE sample issues available **
I am pleased to announce the electronic availability of Volume 1,
Number 2 of Keep Out, the Journal of Electronic Privacy.
To receive a copy, simply send e-mail to
keep-out-current  The subject and body of the message
do not matter.  You will receive an ASCII-text copy of the issue in
reply to your message.  You can also do a Fidonet file request to
1:102/903 and request VOL1-NO2.TXT, or call the Sprawl BBS at
+1-818-342-5127 and download it.
Volume 1, Number 2 had stories on the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
signature bug, a how-to story on anonymous remailers, an interview
with remailer operator Erich von Hollander, and of course, a
continuation of our PGP beginners' series with an introduction to
digital signatures and the web of trust.
While Keep Out is primarily a paper magazine, the text of each issue
is released electronically to make sure the information is
disseminated widely.  This information is too important to limit it
to those who can afford a subscription.
I am sending this message instead of posting the full text of Keep
Out because the electronic edition contains the same commercial
advertisements that the paper version does.  It would be
inappropriate to post it here.
To encourage people to subscribe, and to ensure that Keep Out remains
solvent, the electronic edition is released roughly one month after
the paper version.
It seems to be the lot of new magazines to have deadline troubles.
Keep Out has unfortunately been no exception.  The second issue of
Keep Out was released quite late.  To bring the magazine's date of
issue back in touch with reality, the next issue (Volume 2, Number
1) will be dated March/April, and will be released in paper form on
February 27.
For that issue, we are working on a review of steganography software
(programs for hiding data in sound and picture files), an in-depth
report on Tempest technology (which allows an eavesdropper to view
your computer screen from a distance without using wires), a story
telling the current state of the government's Clipper (wiretap) Chip
initiative, and a continuation of our PGP for beginners' series.
To receive a free, sample issue of Keep Out, with no strings
attached, simply send your postal address to one of the addresses
below.  You will receive a copy of the next issue when it is mailed
out.  Keep Out's mailing list is completely confidential.  No
information about you will be released for any reason, except for
court orders, of course.
Subscriptions to Keep Out are $15 a year for six issues in the U.S.
and Canada, $27 elsewhere.  Back issues of the first two issues
(Volume 1, Numbers 1 and 2) are available at $7 each inside the U.S.
and Canada, $9 elsewhere.  U.S. funds only, please.  Unfortunately, we
can not accept credit cards, but checks and money orders payable to
"Keep Out" are welcome.
