This problem is greatly exagerated. The software simply won't be running in
the average users machine.
If the program propagates like a virus, it will soon be catched and killed
by the anti-virus utilities that any responsible user is already running on
a regular basis.
If you have to start the program for it to do its magic, then just don't
start it. Todays computer users should know that running software you don't
trust is generally a bad idea. That's how you get a virus in the machine in
the first place...
Come on Nathaniel, admit it, it's a scam to sell FV's expensive services!
