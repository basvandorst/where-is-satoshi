@_subject: Disseminating public-key crypto source code 
I've written a few Perl routines for public-key cryptography.  I'd
like to freely disseminate the source code (starting with ElGamal) to
as many people as I can,
It's my understanding that there are two orthogonal restrictions:
While I'm sure these are oversimplifications, it would seem that I can
release my source code over the Internet provided I install a simple
verification mechanism (cf. MIT's PGP distribution) to ensure that
only people claiming to be U.S. citizens have access privileges.
Am I correct?  If so, why aren't more people doing this?
