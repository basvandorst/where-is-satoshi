On today's Sally Jesse Raphel was Curtis Swiva?
founder of the Guardian Angels talking about his new record
of eating pickles.  He plans to break the record for eating 22 hot dogs in 12 minutes.  The whole rest of the stage was
full of drag queens, and other rejects from the Jerry Springer
show.  Curtis must be really hard up to get his mug on TV! William Knowles

@_subject: Alternic.net (was domain zapping) 
With all the talk about InterNIC zapping domains, there should be
some talk about other registries, Alternic.net : is offering an alpha test for registering new TLD's and the prices
are considerably less expensive than the Internic.

 A L T E R N I C . N I C
 Is proud to announce .NIC!
 The folks at alternic.nic (formerly alternic.net) are proud to
 announce alpha testing of the .NIC top level domain name served up by:
 MX.ALTERNIC.NIC at 204.94.42.1
 Other names are served by .NIC...
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    * ALTERNIC.NIC is being built to create a truly PUBLIC Network
      information center, for the benefit of all, on and off the net.
    * ALTERNIC.NIC is broadcast to disseminate information on Internet
      related issues, and to research new ideas on promoting the
      Internet.
    * ALTERNIC.NIC will promote the concept of Top Level Domainsi, and
      the de-centralization of name service. To this end, ALTERNIC.NIC
      will accept registrations for .NIC top level domains, as well as
      for administration of new top level domains. For now ALTERNIC.NIC
      will accept the existance of and promote a limitted number of top
      level domains. It should be recognized that at this point the
      concept of TLD diversification is EXPERIMENTAL.
    * ALTERNIC.NIC Will accept new TLDs or domain names which fit the
      following criteria:
         o The TLD or domain name must not already be registered.
         o DNS must be active for any TLD or domain names.
         o Payment of fees must be made to ALTERNIC.NET in advance.
         o Disputes between name holders may be handled several ways:
              + Release of domain name rights by existing name holder.
                If you want a name that's already registered, offer to
                buy the holder's rights.
              + ALTERNIC.NET will honour court orders from the
                jurisdiction which the domain name is currently
                registered in.
              + Sue ALTERNIC.NET. We're a privately held company, and
                do as we please. If you'd like to serve us with papers,
                it's dba A Towing Company, Inc., a Corporation
                registered with the Secretary of State of Washington
                State, USA. Of course, we'll have our corporate
                attorney counter-sue, and you can do it on our turf, OK

I have a problem with people like Mike Duvos who think that folks like myself and others on this list with ADD use having ADD as a crutch for being fidgety, not getting their work done
on time, or worst yet, Fired.
I wish people like Mr. Duvos could walk a mile in my shoes before
making off the cuff remarks, I wish I could get jobs done on time,
I wish that I could finish one project before starting three more!
My office looks like someone tossed a hand grenade in it,
Proposals to the left, Job quotes to the right, jobs is various states of completion, Lost jobs to my inattentivness to my clients,
Lost good clients because of having ADD and not knowing it!
I wish I would have known about ADD eariler than now, I might
not have been the complete fuck-up that I was in school, and worst
than that, The nearly ten years after high school.  One of my wishes
did come true, and that was finding out that I do have ADD.
Ritalin has been a godsend, I am able to dialin when I have to.
Ritalin is not the only drug for treating ADD, Prozac works for
some.  There are times when I need the boundless energy to
find time to be creative and I stop taking my meds, but its only
for short periods, I remember all too well what I was like without
knowing what the problem was with work, love, and life in Below is a list of famous people with Attention Deficit Disorders and/or Learning Disorders, and I'd be willing to bet that Perry Metzger
either has, or knows someone with ADD. Albert Einstein, Galileo, Mozart, Wright Brothers, Leonardo da Vinci,
Bruce Jenner, Tom Cruise, Charles Schwab, Henry Winkler, Danny Glover,
Walt Disney, John Lennon, Winston Churchill, Henry Ford, Stephen Hawkings, Jules Verne, Alexander Graham Bell, Woodrow Wilson, Hans Christian Anderson,Beavis, Nelson Rockefeller, Thomas Edison, Gen. George Patton, Agatha Christie, John F. Kennedy, Whoopi Goldberg, Rodin, Thomas Thoreau, David H. Murdock, Dustin Hoffman, Pete Rose, Russell White, Jason Kidd, Russell Varian, Robin Williams, Louis Pasteur, Werner von Braun, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Robert Kennedy, alberto Tnmba
Prince Charles, Gen. Westmoreland, Eddie Rickenbacker, Gregory Boyington, Harry Belafonte, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Steve McQueen, George C. Scott, Tom Smothers, Lindsay Wagner, George Bernard Shaw, Beethoven, Carl Lewis, Jackie Stewart, "Magic" Johnson, Weyerhauser family, Wrigley, John Corcoran.
One can only wonder how much more great some of the people on this list would be today if they knew ADD back then. William Knowles

Something that I thought would make an excellent data haven would
be older offshore oil platforms, Their size would allow extended
living periods, electrcity and communications are in place, They
are generally built outside of the territorial waters of most
countries to avoid any damage to the shorelines if oil spilled
(possibility for becoming its own country?) and with the hoops
that Shell Oil went through to please Greenpeace with its last
oil platform.  You have to wonder how cheap these could sell for just to get them off the oil companies hands? Comments or suggestions?

@_subject: Protecting floating datahavens? 
Now I don't claim to be a naval defence expert, But from what I do read of the dogeared copies of Jane's Defence Weekly, Would be to install three or four Phalanx Close-In Weapons Systems, The Phalanx is a radar guided 20mm Gatling gun spraying out 4500 rpm at a range of 1600 yards.  Quite perfect for downing a privately owned MiG-21, Exocet missles from pissed off French gunboats for storing Chirac's medical records and maybe keeping those pesky mercenaries from skydiving onboard.
Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, there are literally all sorts of firepower for sale in the open markets, trolling in the alt.business newsgroups I have been able to find quite a few MiG's for sale, and there's a fellow in Finland that has a former Soviet 'Julliet Class' Diesel-Electric submarine and I understand he's taking offers.
Now this is a completely doable concept, and likely more realistic
than the Oceania project, Unfortunatly like all things, it comes
down to how much money you want to throw at it, I remember how many us on this list balked at Vince charging $500.00 for one
year on a Unix Shell account, I wonder what the market would bear for both a technologically and physically secure datahaven?

Where is Redonda on the map, I'm too lazy to look it up, The group working on the Oceania Project tried to find an accommodating country that would allow them to run as a soverign
nation, Last I heard they were planning to purchase a former hospital ship and refurbish it.
