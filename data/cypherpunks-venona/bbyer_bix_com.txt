I don't know if there will be any new redundancies or not, but PGP
compresses it's output so you would naturally get no further

@_subject: Re: CryptoStacker 
If the project is called CryptoStacker, why not use Stacker?
Have the program go beneath Stacker (or another disk doubling system)
and encrypt/decrypt the actual stacker file as Stacker reads it?  It
would be a much simpler solution once you found out how te interface
with Stacker.

This look suspiciously like a form letter.  The possible plurals
("(s)") and the fact that the site name is in a "list type" format
indicate this is probably a form letter.  This is even more
disturbing; do they have a form letter because they use it often or
do they have a daemon that searches for highly undesirable things
such as ftp sites with lots of encryption related things and
automatically fires off this harassing form letter?

Yes, acoording to a 2600 article (admittedly not the best source),
requesting a file on yoursself causes one to be created if one does
not exist.

How about radio-frequency interference?   I've heard that this works
quite well for video camera and other electronic monitoring equipment.

They do not necessarily have to be co-ordinated (or interconnected at
all).  You could easily give each one a range of combinations to try, and
wait until one succeeds.

I dunno.  The early versions of UNIX had a back door in the login
program put in by the designer.  The compiler also watched for the
login source code to be recompiled and added the back door.  The
compiler also watched for the compiler source code to be recompiled
and inserted the login code modification code _and the compiler
modification code.  You can never be to careful.
