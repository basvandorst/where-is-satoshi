"GSA Memos Reveal that FBI Wiretap Plan was Opposed by Government's Top Telecomm Purchaser"

Services Administration, describes many problems with the FBI's wiretap plan and also shows that the GSA strongly opposed the sweeping proposal.  The GSA is the largest purchaser of telecommunications equipment in the federal government. 1992, would have required telephone manufacturers to design all communications equipment to facilitate wire surveillance. The proposal was defeated last year. The FBI has said that it plans to reintroduce a similar proposal this year.

According to the GSA, the FBI proposal would complicate interoperability, increase cost, and diminish privacy and network security.  The GSA also stated that the proposal could "adversely _affect national security._"

These issues must be addressed as they effect both the government and private industry. There are also civil liberty implications and the public's constitutional rights to privacy which are not mentioned.
it must be noted that equipment already exists that can be used to wiretap the digital communications lines and support court- authorized wiretaps, criminal investigations and probes of voice communications. The total number of interception applications authorized within the United States (Federal and State) has been averaging under nine hundred per year. There is concern that the proposed changes are not cost effective and worth the effort to revamp all the existing and new telecommunications systems.
The proposed bill would have to have the FCC or another agency approve or reject new telephone equipment mainly on the basis of whether the FBI has the capability to wiretap it. The federal- approval process is normally lengthy and the United States may not be able to keep pace with foreign industries to develop new technology and install secure communications. As a matter of interest, the proposed restrictive new technology could impede the United States' ability to compete in digital telephony and participate in the international trade arena.
Finally, there will be unknown associated costs to implement the proposed new technological procedures and equipment. These costs would be borne by the Federal government, consumers, and all other communications ratepayers to finance the effort. Both the Federal government and private industry communications regular phone service, data transmissions, satellite and microwave transmissions, and encrypted communications could be effected at increased costs.

There are, for example, some software packages that are available off the shelves in stores here that are, nevertheless, prohibited from being exported.  And sometimes that's a little bit unrealistic.  On the other hand, there are some in business who are understandably so anxious to find new customers that they will not necessarily pay as much attention as they should to what the customer might use this new capacity for.  And that's a legitimate role for government, to say, hold on, the world will be a much more dangerous place if we have 15 or 20 nuclear powers instead of five or six; and if they have ICBMs and so forth.

I've talked to Martin Hellman quite a few times (he came to my last crypto conference and gave an overview of the field), he has never said that he could crack true DES. When DES first came out, he was one of the people most actively opposing the 56 bit key as being too small. At the time, he estimated that a machine of parallel processors could be built for $10M that would crack DES keys easily. DES at the time was only supposed to be for 10 years and then a new system was supposed to replace it.
Today, he advocates for security that you triple-DES your At last word (and I may have missed any advancements in the flame wars on sci.crypt), Shamir and Biham had cracked up to 2^^46, thats still quite a ways computationally from 2^^56.

CPSR Crypto Statement
April 16, 1993
Washington, DC
               COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC
           DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE
        Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)
today called for the public disclosure of technical data
underlying the government's newly-announced "Public Encryption
Management" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was
announced today by the White House and the National Institute
for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the
technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman
acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-
secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the
encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.
        According to NIST, the technical specifications and the
Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To
open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today
filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security
Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption
plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the
Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to
open the development of non-military computer security standards
to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of
such standards.
        CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in
developing the so-called "digital signature standard" (DSS), a
communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for
government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA
lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first
time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.
NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying
the classification of records concerning its creation of the
        David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the
administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of
electronic communications, as reflected in today's official
statement,  "a step in the right direction."  But he questioned
the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent
secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from
public scrutiny.  "At a time when we are moving towards the
development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital
that standards designed to protect personal privacy be
established openly and with full public participation.  It is
not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of
secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to
play a leading role in the development process."

Comments on White House Clipper Plan
I attended the "interesting" NIST press conference yesterday
on the "Clipper Chip" and may be able to clear up a few quaestions.
According to NIST:
The Chip has 4 functions, including
Thus, it sounds like a key management system may have to be built
into the devices that will be sold with the chip. However this means that they will also be able to determine which key to get becuase they will know the serial number. It also seems likely that once your key is compromised, its gone forever. This is a serious problem
The Attorney General will determine next week who will be the escrow agents for this. I am willing to bet $ that NIST/Commerce will be one of them (not a lot, after all, I do work for a non-profit).
Everything about this proposal is classified. The chip is classified but even more disturbing, the president directing ordering a review into crypto policy is also classified. CPSR has already filed 11 FOIA requests for all information, including the directive. You can expect that we will be filing suit shortly to get those documents and force this out into the open. When I questioned them about why the review was happening after the proposal, they did not answer me.
This is not 1984 all over again-its '86. The NSA tried this exact same "black box" proposal (minus the escrow) in 1986. Industry laughed them out of the park. NIST also stated that the proposal has been implimented for 14 months and they (NSA actually) have been working on it for at least 4 years. AT&T announced yesterday that will will begin selling devices with these Clippers in them immediatly. We've been sold down the river by ma bell again.

@_subject: AT&T Press Release on Clipper 
Here's AT&T's announcement on the Clipper.
 AT&T TO INCORPORATE NEW 'CLIPPER' CHIP INTO SECURE COMMUNICATIONS
PRODUCT LINE
GREENSBORO, N.C., April 16
    AT&T (NYSE: T) said today it is moving to improve the security and privacy
of telephone communications by incorporating a just-announced new U.S.
government technology for voice  encryption  into its secure communications
product line.
   AT&T will use the Clipper chip, announced today by President Clinton as a new technology for voice  encryption,  in all of its secure telephone products
except those specially designed for government classified customers.  The
Commerce Department has announced a six-month timetable for the final
certification of Clipper.
   "AT&T is pleased to be the first company to publicly commit to adoption of
the Clipper chip," said Ed Hickey, AT&T vice president, Secure Communications
Systems.  "We believe it will give our customers far greater protection in
defeating hackers or eavesdroppers attempting to intercept a call.
   "And now all commercially available AT&T voice  encryption  products will be compatible with each other, a major step forward in bringing secure
communications capabilities to the business community."
   In standardizing AT&T voice  encryption  products on the Clipper chip, AT&T
will include the algorithm in the Telephone Security Device as well as in the
Secure Voice/Data Terminal.
   The AT&T Telephone Security Device is a compact, lightweight unit that brings advance  encryption  technology to conventional land-line and cellular
telephones.  It provides a powerful, convenient and reliable way to protect the most sensitive telephone conversations.
   The device works with a conventional land-line or transportable/mobile
cellular phone.  It turns the phone's signal into a digital stream of encrypted information that is decrypted by a Telephone Security Device attached to the phone at the receiving end of the call.
   The AT&T Telephone Security Device connects easily to desk telephones or
tranportable or mobile phones.  It weighs 1.5 pounds and is 7 inches long, 4.5
inches wide and 1.5 inches high.  And it's as easy to use as it is portable.
   The AT&T Secure Voice/Data Terminals are desktop telephones that provide
 encryption  for both telephone calls and data transmissions.
   These AT&T secure communications products use an enhanced voice  encryption  technique that provides very high voice quality.  This technology allows calls placed with these products to approach the voice quality of normal calls.
   To further enhance interoperability, AT&T will consider licensing to other
manufacturers its enabling technologies for interoperability. Interoperability
of  encryption  devices requires common technology beyond the use of a common
 encryption  algorithm, specifically common methods of digital voice encoding
and signaling.
   AT&T has already performed integration tests with Clipper chips manufactured by the government's supplier, Mykotronx Inc., of Torrence, Calif., and is preparing to integrate the chip into the manufacturing of its secure products.   AT&T's Clipper-equipped telephone security devices will be available to customers by the end of the second quarter.
    The federal government intends to adopt the Clipper chip as the
standard for voice  encryption  to help protect proprietary information,
protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent
unauthorized release of data transmitted electonically.  At the same
time, use of the Clipper chip will preserve the ability of federal,
state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone
conversations of criminals.
    "Adoption of Clipper will support both the government's efforts to
protect the public and the public's right to privacy," Hickey said.
    AT&T Secure Communication Systems provides products to protect
voice, data, fax, cellular and video communications.  It also engineers
and integrates secure communications applications.  Its customers
include the governments of the United States and other nations as well
as major corporations around the world.
    AT&T Secure Communications Systems is headquartered in Greensboro.

I have found from experience, with some success, that the best way to
handle press if you to contact local press and present yourself
as a local expert on the subject. This gives them a local connection
for their stories. You should have apack ready to send them, including
copies of the White House documents, and a 1 page fact sheet of your own
pointing out the problems with the proposal. Present yourself as a local computer scientist who sees the deeper issues behind this proposal and wants
to air them.
The major national newspapers are already covering this but its the smaller local papers that most people read. Only a few million people total read the
NY Times, Washinging Post etc. Thinks of the millions that read their local papers and get to them. If they respond, this will be killed.
History of Clipper:
As I mentioned before, Iwas at the NIST press Conference on Fri. They responded to a question by saying that they had been working on this for 4 years and had been implimenting it for 14 months.

No CPSR, etc. were not involved as a cabal supporting this dingbat proposal. If you beliueve that then go back to reading your endless JFK/CIA/Mafia/aliens conspiracy theory books and let the rest of us go on living in the real world.

THE BIG BROTHER AWARDS
Governments, private sector organizations, credit bureaus,
police departments and the military in many countries are
engaging in programs which have the effect of eroding the rights
and privacy of individuals. These practices often breach
international human rights conventions, and threaten the balance
or evolution of free and open societies. In many cases,
information technology is used for the purposes of increasing
the power of authorities, while diminishing the rights of
individuals. These violations occur  in all parts of the  world.
The Big Brother awards  sponsored by Privacy International, will
be given to the organization, initiative, government or act
which is most invasive of private life, or which is responsible
for the most dangerous and intrusive acts of surveillance.
Privacy International believes that there should be a more
widespread awareness of these practices. We believe people have
the right to know when governments or other organizations are
engaging in intrusive practices that limit individual rights. We
aim to provide an effective context for viewing these invasive
practices, by establishing an international benchmark. The
establishment of the Big Brother awards aims to provide a
world-wide focus on surveillance and privacy.

New NIST/NSA Revelations
        Less than three weeks after the White House announced a
controversial initiative to secure the nation's electronic
communications with government-approved cryptography, newly
released documents raise serious questions about the process that
gave rise to the administration's proposal.  The documents,
released by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit,
suggest that the super-secret National Security Agency (NSA)
dominates the process of establishing security standards for
civilian computer systems in contravention of the intent of
legislation Congress enacted in 1987.
        The released material concerns the development of the
Digital Signature Standard (DSS), a cryptographic method for
authenticating the identity of the sender of an electronic
communication and for authenticating the integrity of the data in
that communication.  NIST publicly proposed the DSS in August 1991
and initially made no mention of any NSA role in developing the
standard, which was intended for use in unclassified, civilian
communications systems.  NIST finally conceded that NSA had, in
fact, developed the technology after Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility (CPSR) filed suit against the agency for
withholding relevant documents.  The proposed DSS was widely
criticized within the computer industry for its perceived weak
security and inferiority to an existing authentication technology
known as the RSA algorithm.  Many observers have speculated that
the RSA technique was disfavored by NSA because it was, in fact,
more secure than the NSA-proposed algorithm and because the RSA
technique could also be used to encrypt data very securely.
        The newly-disclosed documents -- released in heavily censored
form at the insistence of NSA -- suggest that NSA was not merely
involved in the development process, but dominated it.  NIST and
NSA worked together on the DSS through an intra-agency Technical
Working Group (TWG).  The documents suggest that the NIST-NSA
relationship was contentious, with NSA insisting upon secrecy
throughout the deliberations.  A NIST report dated January 31,
1990, states that
     The members of the TWG acknowledged that the efforts
     expended to date in the determination of a public key
     algorithm which would be publicly known have not been
     successful.  It's increasingly evident that it is
     difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the concerns
     and requirements of NSA, NIST and the general public
     through using this approach.
        The civilian agency's frustration is also apparent in a July
21, 1990, memo from the NIST members of the TWG to NIST director
John W. Lyons.  The memo suggests that "national security"
concerns hampered efforts to develop a standard:
     THE NIST/NSA Technical Working Group (TWG) has held 18
     meetings over the past 13 months.  A part of every
     meeting has focused on the NIST intent to develop a
     Public Key Standard Algorithm Standard.  We are
     convinced that the TWG process has reached a point where
     continuing discussions of the public key issue will
     yield only marginal results.  Simply stated, we believe
     that over the past 13 months we have explored the
     technical and national security equity issues to the
     point where a decision is required on the future
     direction of digital signature standards.
An October 19, 1990, NIST memo discussing possible patent issues
surrounding DSS noted that those questions would need to be
addressed "if we ever get our NSA problem settled."
        Although much of the material remains classified and withheld
from disclosure, the "NSA problem" was apparently the intelligence
agency's demand that perceived "national security" considerations
take precedence in the development of the DSS.  From the outset,
NSA cloaked the deliberations in secrecy.  For instance, at the
March 22, 1990, meeting of the TWG, NSA representatives presented
NIST with NSA's classified proposal for a DSS algorithm.  NIST's
report of the meeting notes that
     The second document, classified TOP SECRET CODEWORD, was
     a position paper which discussed reasons for the
     selection of the algorithms identified in the first
     document.  This document is available at NSA for review
     by properly cleared senior NIST officials.
In other words, NSA presented highly classified material to NIST
justifying NSA's selection of the proposed algorithm -- an
algorithm intended to protect and authenticate unclassified
information in civilian computer systems.  The material was so
highly classified that "properly cleared senior NIST officials"
were required to view the material at NSA's facilities.
        These disclosures are disturbing for two reasons.  First, the
process as revealed in the documents contravenes the intent of
Congress embodied in the Computer Security Act of 1987.  Through
that legislation, Congress intended to remove NSA from the process
of developing civilian computer security standards and to place
that responsibility with NIST, a civilian agency.  Congress
expressed a particular concern that NSA, a military intelligence
agency, would improperly limit public access to information in a
manner incompatible with civilian standard setting.  The House
Report on the legislation noted that NSA's
     natural tendency to restrict and even deny access to
     information that it deems important would disqualify
     that agency from being put in charge of the protection
     of non-national security information in the view of many
     officials in the civilian agencies and the private
     sector.
While the Computer Security Act contemplated that NSA would
provide NIST with "technical assistance" in the development of
civilian standards, the newly released documents demonstrate that
NSA has crossed that line and dominates the development process.
        The second reason why this material is significant is because
of what it reveals about the process that gave rise to the so-
called "Clipper" chip proposed by the administration earlier this
month.  Once again, NIST was identified as the agency actually
proposing the new encryption technology, with "technical
assistance" from NSA.  Once again, the underlying information
concerning the development process is classified.  DSS was the
first test of the Computer Security Act's division of labor
between NIST and NSA.  Clipper comes out of the same
"collaborative" process.  The newly released documents suggest
that NSA continues to dominate the government's work on computer
security and to cloak the process in secrecy, contrary to the
clear intent of Congress.
        On the day the Clipper initiative was announced, CPSR
submitted FOIA requests to key agencies -- including NIST and NSA

     Public Key Standard Algorithm Standard.  We are
     convinced that the TWG process has reached a point where
     continuing discussions of the public key issue will
     yield only marginal results.  Simply stated, we believe
     that over the past 13 months we have explored the
     technical and national security equity issues to the
     point where a decision is required on the future
     direction of digital signature standards.
An October 19, 1990, NIST memo discussing possible patent issues
surrounding DSS noted that those questions would need to be
addressed "if we ever get our NSA problem settled."
        Although much of the material remains classified and withheld
from disclosure, the "NSA problem" was apparently the intelligence
agency's demand that perceived "national security" considerations
take precedence in the development of the DSS.  From the outset,
NSA cloaked the deliberations in secrecy.  For instance, at the
March 22, 1990, meeting of the TWG, NSA representatives presented
NIST with NSA's classified proposal for a DSS algorithm.  NIST's
report of the meeting notes that
     The second document, classified TOP SECRET CODEWORD, was
     a position paper which discussed reasons for the
     selection of the algorithms identified in the first
     document.  This document is available at NSA for review
     by properly cleared senior NIST officials.
In other words, NSA presented highly classified material to NIST
justifying NSA's selection of the proposed algorithm -- an
algorithm intended to protect and authenticate unclassified
information in civilian computer systems.  The material was so
highly classified that "properly cleared senior NIST officials"
were required to view the material at NSA's facilities.
        These disclosures are disturbing for two reasons.  First, the
process as revealed in the documents contravenes the intent of
Congress embodied in the Computer Security Act of 1987.  Through
that legislation, Congress intended to remove NSA from the process
of developing civilian computer security standards and to place
that responsibility with NIST, a civilian agency.  Congress
expressed a particular concern that NSA, a military intelligence
agency, would improperly limit public access to information in a
manner incompatible with civilian standard setting.  The House
Report on the legislation noted that NSA's
     natural tendency to restrict and even deny access to
     information that it deems important would disqualify
     that agency from being put in charge of the protection
     of non-national security information in the view of many
     officials in the civilian agencies and the private
     sector.
While the Computer Security Act contemplated that NSA would
provide NIST with "technical assistance" in the development of
civilian standards, the newly released documents demonstrate that
NSA has crossed that line and dominates the development process.
        The second reason why this material is significant is because
of what it reveals about the process that gave rise to the so-
called "Clipper" chip proposed by the administration earlier this
month.  Once again, NIST was identified as the agency actually
proposing the new encryption technology, with "technical
assistance" from NSA.  Once again, the underlying information
concerning the development process is classified.  DSS was the
first test of the Computer Security Act's division of labor
between NIST and NSA.  Clipper comes out of the same
"collaborative" process.  The newly released documents suggest
that NSA continues to dominate the government's work on computer
security and to cloak the process in secrecy, contrary to the
clear intent of Congress.
        On the day the Clipper initiative was announced, CPSR
submitted FOIA requests to key agencies -- including NIST and NSA

                 Dave Banisar, policy analyst
     Mr. Chairman, members of the Advisory Panel, thank you for the opportunity to speak today about emerging issues on cryptography policy.      My name is Marc Rotenberg and I am director of the CPSR Washington office.  Although CPSR does not represent any computer firm or industry trade association, we speak for many in the computer profession who value privacy and are concerned about the government's Clipper proposal.
     During the last several years CPSR has organized several meetings to promote public discussion of cryptography issues.  We have also obtained important government documents through the Freedom of Information Act.  We believe that good policies will only result if the public, the profession, and the policy makers are fully informed about the significance of these recent proposals.
     We are pleased that the Advisory Board has organized hearings.  This review of cryptography policy will help determine if the Clipper proposal is in the best interests of the country.  We believe that a careful review of the relevant laws and policies shows that the key escrow arrangement is at odds with the public interest, and that therefore the Clipper proposal should not go forward.
     Today I will address issues 1 through 3 identified in the NIST announcement, specifically the policy requirements of the Computer Security Act, the legal issues surrounding the key escrow arrangement, and the importance of privacy for network 1. CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY
     The first issue concerns the 1987 statute enacted to improve computer security in the federal government, to clarify the responsibilities of NIST and NSA, and to ensure that technical standards would serve civilian and commercial needs.  The Computer Security Act, which also established this Advisory Panel, is the true cornerstone of cryptography policy in the United States.  That law made clear that in the area of unclassified computing systems, the Department of Commerce and not the Department of Defense, would be responsible for the development of technical standards.  It emphasized public accountability and stressed open decision-making.
     The Computer Security Act grew out of a concern that classified standards and secret meetings would not serve the interests of the general public.  As the practical applications for cryptography have moved from the military and intelligence arenas to the commercial sphere, this point has become clear.  There is also clearly a conflict of interest when an agency tasked with signal interception is also given authority to develop standards for network security.       In the spirit of the Computer Security Act, NIST set out in 1989 to develop a public key standard FIPS.  In a memo dated May 5, 1989 and obtained by CPSR through the Freedom of Information Act, NIST said that it planned:
         to develop the necessary public-key based security          standards.  We require a public-key algorithm for          calculating digital signatures and we also require a          public-key algorithm for distributing secret keys.  NIST then went on to define the requirements of the standard:
         The algorithms that we use must be public, unclassified,          implementable in both hardware or software, usable by          federal Agencies and U.S. based multi-national          corporation, and must provide a level of security          sufficient for the protection of unclassified, sensitive          information and commercial propriety and/or valuable          information.
     The Clipper proposal and the full-blown Capstone configuration, which incorporates the key management function NIST set out to develop in 1989, is very different from the one originally conceived by NIST.          %  The Clipper algorithm, Skipjack, is classified,
         %  Public access to the reasons underlying the proposal is             restricted,          %  Skipjack can be implemented only in tamper-proof             hardware,          %  It is unlikely to be used by multi-national corporations,             and
         %  Its security remains unproven.
     The Clipper proposal undermines the central purpose of the Computer Security Act.  Although intended for broad use in commercial networks, it was not developed at the request of either U.S. business or the general public.  It does not reflect public goals.  Rather it reflects the interests of one secret agency with the authority to conduct foreign signal intelligence and another government agency  responsible for law enforcement investigations.       It is our belief that the Clipper proposal clearly violates the intent of the Computer Security Act of 1987.  What is the significance of this?  It is conceivable that an expert panel of cryptographers will review the Skipjack algorithm and find that it lives up its billing, that there is no "trap door" and no easy way to reverse-engineer.  In fact, the White House has proposed just such a review process      But is this process adequate?  Is this the procedure the Advisory Board would endorse for the development of widespread technical standards?  The expert participants will probably not be permitted to publish their assessments of the proposal in scientific journals, further review of the standard will be restricted, and those who are skeptical will remain in the dark about the actual design of the chip.  This may be an appropriate process for certain military systems, but it is clearly inappropriate for a technical standard that the government believes should be widely incorporated into the communications infrastructure.
     Good government policy requires that certain process goals be satisfied.  Decisions should be made in the open.  The interests of the participating agencies should be clear.  Agencies should be accountable for their actions and recommendations.  Black boxes and government oversight are not compatible.
     There is an even greater obligation to promote open decisions where technical and scientific issues are at stake.  Innovation depends on openness.  The scientific method depends on the ability of researchers to "kick the tires" and "test drive" the product.  And, then, even if it is a fairly good design, additional testing encourages the development of new features, improved performance and reduced cost.  Government secrecy is incompatible which such a development process.
     Many of these principles are incorporated into the Computer Security Act and the Freedom of Information Act.  The current government policy on the development of unclassified technical standards, as set out in the Computer Security Act, is a very good policy.  It emphasizes public applications, stresses open review, and ensures public accountability.  It is not the policy that is flawed.  It is the Clipper proposal.
     To accept the Clipper proposal would be to endorse a process that ran contrary to the law, that discourages innovation, and that undermines openness.
2. LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
     There are several legal and constitutional issues raised by the government's key escrow proposal.       The premise of the Clipper key escrow arrangement is that the government must have the ability to intercept electronic communications, regardless of the economic or societal costs.  The FBI's Digital Telephony proposal, and the earlier Senate bill 266, was based on the same assumption.
     There are a number of arguments made in defense of this position: that privacy rights and law enforcement needs must be balanced, or that the government will be unable to conduct criminal investigations without this capability.      Regardless of how one views these various claims, there is one point about the law that should be made very clear: currently there is no legal basis -- in statute, the Constitution or anywhere else --  that supports the premise which underlies the Clipper proposal.  As the law currently stands, surveillance is not a design goal.  General Motors would have a stronger legal basis for building cars that could not go faster than 65 miles per hour than AT&T does in marketing a commercial telephone that has a built-in wiretap capability.  In law there is simply nothing about the use of a telephone that is inherently illegal or suspect.
     The federal wiretap statute says only that communication service providers must assist law enforcement in the execution of a lawful warrant.  It does not say that anyone is obligated to design systems to facilitate future wire surveillance.  That distinction is the difference between countries that restrict wire surveillance to narrow circumstances defined in law and those that treat all users of the telephone network as potential criminals.  U.S. law takes the first approach.  Countries such as the former East Germany took the second approach.  The use of the phone system by citizens was considered inherently suspect and for that reason more than 10,000 people were employed by the East German government to listen in on telephone calls.
     It is precisely because the wiretap statute does not contain the obligation to incorporate surveillance capability -- the design premise of the Clipper proposal -- that the Federal Bureau of Investigation introduced the Digital Telephony legislation.  But that legislation has not moved forward on Capitol Hill and the law has remained unchanged.  The Clipper proposal attempts to accomplish through the standard-setting and procurement process what the Congress has been unwilling to do through the legislative process.
     On legal grounds, adopting the Clipper would be a mistake.  There is an important policy goal underlying the wiretap law.  The Fourth Amendment and the federal wiretap statute do not so much balance competing interests as they erect barriers against government excess and define the proper scope of criminal investigation.  The purpose of the federal wiretap law is to restrict the government, it is not to coerce the public.
     Therefore, if the government endorses the Clipper proposal, it will undermine the basic philosophy of the federal wiretap law and the fundamental values embodied in the Constitution.  It will establish a technical mechanism for signal interception based on a premise that has no legal foundation.  I am not speaking rhetorically about "Big Brother."  My point is simply that the assumption underlying the Clipper proposal is more compatible with the practice of telephone surveillance in the former East Germany than it is with the narrowly limited circumstances that wire surveillance has been allowed in the United States.       There are a number of other legal issues that have not been adequately considered by the proponents of the key escrow arrangement that the Advisory Board should examine.  First, not all lawful wiretaps follow a normal warrant process.  It is critical that the proponents of Clipper make very clear how emergency wiretaps will be conducted before the proposal goes forward.  Second, there may be civil liability issues for the escrow agents if there is abuse or compromise of the keys.  Escrow agents may be liable for any harm that results.  Third, there is a Fifth Amendment dimension to the proposed escrow key arrangement if a network user is compelled to disclose his or her key to the government in order to access a communications network. Each one of these issues should be examined.       There is also one legislative change that we would like the Advisory Board to consider.  During our FOIA litigation, the NSA cited a 1951 law to withhold certain documents that were critical to understand the development of the Digital Signature Standard.  The law, passed  grants the government the right restrict the disclosure of any classified information pertaining to cryptography.  While the government may properly withhold classified information in FOIA cases, the practical impact of this particular provision is to provide another means to insulate cryptographic policy from public review.       Given the importance of public review of cryptography policy, the requirement of the Computer Security Act, and the Advisory Board's own commitment to an open, public process, we ask the Advisory Board to recommend to the President and to the Congress that section 798 be repealed or substantially revised to reflect current      This is the one area of national cryptography policy where we believe a change is necessary.
3. INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY
     Communications privacy remains a critical test for network development.  Networks that do not provide a high degree of privacy are clearly less useful to network users.  Given the choice between a cryptography product without a key escrow and one with a key escrow, it would be difficult to find a user who would prefer the key escrow requirement.  If this proposal does go forward, it will not be because network users or commercial service providers favored it.
     Many governments are now facing questions about restrictions on cryptography similar to the question now being raised in this country.  It is clear that governments may choose to favor the interests of consumers and businesses over law enforcement.  Less than a month ago, the government of Australia over-rode the objections of law enforcement and intelligence agencies and allowed the Australian telephone companies to go forward with new digital mobile phone networks, GSM, using the A5 robust algorithm.   Other countries will soon face similar decisions.  We hope that they will follow a similar path
     To briefly summarize, the problem here is not the existing law on computer security or policies on cryptography and wire surveillance.   The Computer Security Act stresses public standards, open review, and commercial applications.  The federal wiretap statute is one of the best privacy laws in the world.  With the exception of one provision in the criminal code left over from the Cold War, our current cryptography policy is very good.  It reflects many of the values -- individual liberty, openness, government accountability -- that are crucial for democratic societies to function.
     The problem is the Clipper proposal.  It is an end-run around policies intended to restrict government surveillance and to ensure agency accountability.  It is an effort to put in place a technical configuration that is at odds with the federal wiretap law and the protection of individual privacy.  It is for these reasons that we ask the Advisory Board to recommend to the Secretary of Commerce, the White House, and the Congress that the current Clipper proposal not go forward.
     I thank you for the opportunity to speak with you about these issues.  I wish to invite the members of the Advisory Committee to the third annual CPSR Privacy and Cryptography conference that will be held Monday, June 7 in Washington, DC at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.  That meeting will provide an opportunity for further discussion about cryptography policy.

                      Resolution At Mr. Kammer's request we have conducted two days of hearings.  The clear message of the majority of input was that there are serious concerns regarding the Key Escrow Initiative and the Board concurs with these concerns.  Many of these issues are still to be fully understood and more time is needed to achieving that Accordingly, this Board resolves to have an additional meeting in July 1993 in order to more completely respond to Mr. Kammer's request and to fulfill its statutory obligations under P.L. 100-235.  The Board recommends that the inter-agency review take note of our input collected, our preliminary finding, and adjust the timetable to allow for resolution of the significant issues and problems raised.
Attached to this resolution is a preliminary distillation of the serious concerns and problems.
                     Resolution Key escrowing encryption technology represents a dramatic change in the nation's information infrastructure.  The full implications of this encryption technique are not fully understood at this time.  Therefore, the Board recommends that key escrowing encryption technology not be deployed beyond current implementations planned within the Executive Branch, until the significant public policy and technical issues inherent with this encryption technique are fully understood.
[Attachment to Resolution -  A convincing statement of the problem that Clipper attempts to solve has not been provided.
- Export and important controls over cryptographic products must be reviewed.  Based upon data compiled from U.S. and international vendors, current controls are negatively impacting U.S. competitiveness in the world market and are not inhibiting the foreign production and use of cryptography (DES and RSA)
- The Clipper/Capstone proposal does not address the needs of the software industry, which is a critical and significant component of the National Information Infrastructure and the U.S. economy.
- Additional DES encryption alternatives and key management alternatives should be considered since there is a significant installed base.
- The individuals reviewing the Skipjack algorithm and key management system must be given an appropriate time period and environment in which to perform a thorough review.  This review must address the escrow protocol and chip implementation as well as the algorithm itself.
- Sufficient information must be provided on the proposed key escrow scheme to allow it to be fully understood by the general public.  It does not appear to be clearly defined at this time and, since it is an integral part of the security of the system, it appears to require further development and consideration of alternatives to the key escrow scheme (e.g., three "escrow" entities, one of which is a non-government agency, and a software based solution).
- The economic implications for the Clipper/Capstone proposal have not been examined.  These costs go beyond the vendor cost of the chip and include such factors as customer installation, maintenance, administration, chip replacement, integration and interfacing, government escrow systems costs, etc.
- Legal issues raised by the proposal must be reviewed.
- Congress, as well as the Administration, should play a role in the conduct and approval of the results of the     NIST Resolutions on Key Escow Issues and Clipper

The measure will establish important safeguards for workers and consumers in the United States.  We believe that H.R. 1900 is particularly important as our country becomes more dependent on computerized information systems and the risk of privacy abuse increases.
For almost a decade we have advocated for the design of computer systems that better serve the needs of employees in the workplace.  We do not view this particular goal as a trade-off between labor and management.  It is our belief that computer systems and information policies that are designed so as to value employees will lead to a more productive work environment and ultimately more successful companies and organizations.  As Charles Hecksher of the Harvard Business School has said good managers have no use for secret monitoring.
certain fundamental rights of employees are safeguarded.  The protection of personal privacy in the information age may be as crucial for American workers as the protection of safety was in the age of machines.  Organizations that fail to develop appropriate workplace privacy policies leave employees at risk of abuse, embarrassment, and harassment.

Clearly, the policies and the bill itself are not intended to prohibit monitoring, nor to prevent employers from protecting their business interests.  What the bill will do is help establish a clear framework that ensures employees are properly notified of monitoring practices, that personal information is not misused, and that monitoring capability is not abused.  It is a straightforward, sensible approach that does not so much balance rights as it clarifies interests and ensures that both employers and employees will respect appropriate limitations on monitoring capability. for workplace privacy protection is clear.  Privacy problems will become more acute in the years ahead as new monitoring schemes are developed and new forms of personal data are collected.  As Professor Gary Marx has made clear, there is little that can be imagined in the monitoring realm that can not be achieved.  Already, some members of the computer profession are wearing "active badges" that provide full-time geographical monitoring.  Properly used, these devices help employees use new tools in the hi-tech workplace.  Improperly used, such devices could track the physical movements of an employee throughout the day, almost like a blip on a radar screen.

CPSR Secrecy Statement
    Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) has called for a complete overhaul in the federal government's information classification system, including the removal of cryptography from the categories of information automatically deemed to be secret.  In a letter to a special Presidential task force examining the classification system, CPSR said that the current system -- embodied in an Executive Order issued by President Reagan in 1982 -- "has limited informed public debate on technological issues and has restricted scientific innovation and technological development."
       The CPSR statement, which was submitted in response to a task force request for public comments, strongly criticizes a provision in the Reagan secrecy directive that presumptively classifies any information that "concerns cryptology."  CPSR notes that "while cryptography -- the science of making and breaking secret security codes -- was once the sole province of the military and the intelligence agencies, the technology today plays an essential role in assuring the security and privacy of a wide range of communications affecting finance, education, research and personal correspondence."  With the end of the Cold War and the growth of widely available computer network services, the outdated view of cryptography reflected in the Reagan order must change, according to the statement.
       CPSR's call for revision of the classification system is based upon the organization's experience in attempting to obtain government information relating to cryptography and computer security issues.  CPSR is currently litigating Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the National Security Agency (NSA) seeking the disclosure of technical data concerning the digital signature standard (DSS) and the administration's recent "Clipper Chip" proposal.

Attention: PRD Task Force
     Re: Proposed Changes to the Security Classification System
     This submission is made in response to the Notice published in the Federal Register on May 20, 1993 (58 FR 29480).  According to the Notice, the Task Force is soliciting submissions "by interested parties on proposals to change the system under which information is classified, safeguarded, and declassified in the interest of national security."  Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), a national organization of professionals in the computing field, has a long-standing interest in the problems surrounding the current information classification system -- a system that has limited informed public debate on technological issues and has restricted scientific innovation and technological development.  Based on our experience conducting litigation under the Freedom of Information Act and our efforts to assess certain government policies concerning cryptography and computer security, we have the following recommendations regarding changes to the security classification system.
General Recommendations       CPSR believes that the current Executive Order 12356 is far too broad in its definition of classifiable information and that post Cold War realities require the substantial revision of this outdated directive.  We share the views of many public interest, journalistic, academic, historical, and scientific organizations that have recommended a complete revision of the classification scheme.  We believe such a revision is both necessary and appropriate.  In particular, we support the following changes to the classification system:
     *  A return to the "balancing test," whereby the public      interest in the disclosure of information is weighed      against the claimed harm that might result from such      disclosure;
     *  A prohibition against the reclassification of      information that has been previously released;
     *  The requirement that the economic cost of classifying      scientific and technical be completed before such      information may be classified;
     *  The automatic declassification of information after      20 years, unless the head of the original classifying      agency, in the exercise of his or her non-delegable      authority, determines in writing that the material      requires continued classification for a specified      period of time; and
     *  The establishment of an independent oversight      commission to monitor the operation of the security      classification system.
"Cryptology" as a Classification Category
     In addition to endorsing these general recommendations, we wish to address in detail one particular provision of the current Executive Order that unnecessarily restricts the dissemination of technical data that should be routinely available to the public and the scientific community.  At the time EO 12356 was promulgated in 1982, a new classification category was established, simply defined as "cryptology."  EO 12356, Sec. 1.3(a)(8).  When the House Government Operations Committee examined the Executive Order shortly after its issuance, the Committee concluded that "[t]he need for this new category is uncertain" and noted that "[t]he word 'cryptology,' as added by the Reagan order, is not qualified or defined."  H. Rep. No. 731, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1982).
     This concern carries even more weight today.  The designation of a routine privacy-enhancing technology as presumptively a national security matter is inconsistent with the end of the Cold War and the dramatic growth of commercial and civilian telecommunications networks.  While cryptography -- the science of making and breaking secret security codes -- was once the sole province of the military and the intelligence agencies, the technology today plays an essential role in assuring the security and privacy of a wide range of communications affecting finance, education, research, and personal correspondence.       Electronic communications are now widely used in the civilian sector and have become an integral component of the global economy.  Computers store and exchange an ever increasing amount of personal information, including medical and financial data.  In this electronic environment, the need for privacy-enhancing technologies is apparent.  Communications applications such as electronic mail and electronic funds transfers require secure means of encryption and authentication -- goals that can be achieved only through the development and dissemination of robust cryptographic technology within the civilian sector.
The Computer Security Act and Civilian Cryptography
     In recognition of the emerging significance of civilian cryptography, Congress enacted the Computer Security Act (P.L. 100-235) in 1987.  When Congress enacted the legislation, it expressed particular concern that the National Security Agency ("NSA"), a secretive military intelligence agency, would improperly limit public access to information concerning civilian computer security activities.  H. Rep. No. 153 (Part 2), 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 21 (1987).  The House Report on the Act notes that NSA's      natural tendency to restrict and even deny access to      information that it deems important would disqualify      that agency from being put in charge of the protection      of non-national security information in the view of many      officials in the civilian agencies and the private      sector.  Id.       To alleviate these concerns, Congress granted sole authority to the National Institute of Standards and Technology ("NIST") -- a civilian agency within the Department of Commerce -- to establish technical cryptography standards for civilian computer security.  During Congress' consideration of the legislation, "NSA opposed its passage and asserted that NSA should be in control of this nation's computer standards program."  Id. at 7.  Congress forthrightly rejected NSA's position, noting that continued military control over all cryptographic development "would jeopardize the entire Federal standards program."  Id. at 26.
     Since the enactment of the Computer Security Act, CPSR has sought to monitor compliance with its provisions.  In keeping with those efforts, CPSR requested relevant information from NIST under the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") concerning the development of the "digital signature standard" -- the agency's first proposed cryptographic standard since passage of the legislation.  It is important to note that the proposed standard itself would be "applicable to all federal departments and agencies for the protection of unclassified information."  56 Fed. Reg. 42981 (August 30, 1991) (emphasis added).       After CPSR filed a lawsuit to compel disclosure of the information, NIST acknowledged that the great bulk of responsive material was under the jurisdiction of NSA.  NSA, in turn, has sought to withhold a substantial amount of that information on the grounds that it "concerns cryptology" and is therefore classified.  CPSR v. National Institute of Standards and Technology, et al., C.A. 92-0972-RCL (D.D.C.).  The current Executive Order is thus being used to classify information relating to a civilian agency's development of a security standard intended to protect unclassified information.  Such a result contravenes Congress' intent that non-military cryptographic standards would be developed openly and subject to public scrutiny.
The Public Interest in Cryptography
     More recent developments further illustrate how the application of cryptographic technology is moving out of the "national security" realm and is thus an inappropriate subject for presumptive classification.  On April 16, 1993, the President announced that "government engineers" had developed a new cryptographic device known as the "Clipper Chip" that is intended for widespread public use.  The President noted that "[s]ophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer ... [and] is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files."  He also recognized that "encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information."       Unfortunately, the administration subsequently acknowledged that the "Clipper" technology was developed by NSA and that the underlying technical data is classified.  As in the case of the digital signature standard, a new technology that may have a significant impact on the nation's telecommunications infrastructure was developed in secrecy behind a shield of NSA-
imposed classification.  There is a great deal of interest in the development of civilian cryptography, but public involvement in the process has been substantially hampered by the improper classification of relevant technical information.  See, e.g., Markoff, U.S. as Big Brother of Computer Age, New York Times, May 6, 1993 at D1.      In the Cold War atmosphere that prevailed for 45 years, cryptography was often viewed as a national security matter and policy makers were at times willing to permit the National Security Agency and the military establishment to maintain a shroud of secrecy around the technology, even to the detriment of scientific research and public accountability.  With the end of the Cold War and the growth of widely available computer network services, this view of cryptography must change.  Indeed, Congress recognized the need for reform when it enacted the Computer Security Act in 1987, even before the demise of the Soviet Union.  At the same time, cryptographic technology has become an increasingly vital component of the nation's civilian information infrastructure.  Under these circumstances, there is no rational basis for continuing the presumption that information that "concerns cryptology" should be classified.  The economic and scientific cost to the country of the continuation of this policy will be substantial and cannot be justified.
     We believe that cryptographic information should only be classified upon a specific showing that such disclosure will result in an identifiable harm to legitimate national security interests.  Such a showing could clearly be made, for instance, with respect to the actual "keys" to government cryptographic systems.  However, the wholesale classification of all information relating to this increasingly important field of computer science cannot be justified and may even slow the development of more secure systems.  We urge the Task Force to recommend to the President that "cryptology" be removed from any listing of classification categories that might be contained in a revised Executive Order on security classification.
     *  "Cryptology" should be removed from the designated      "Classification Categories."
Limitations on Quasi-Classification Authority
     In addition to our concern regarding classification for cryptology, we wish to raise several additional points about the operation of the Executive Order. One aspect of the Executive Order concerning classification authority with which we agree has not received proper notice by federal agencies.   That is paragraph (b) or Part 1 which states that "Except as otherwise provided by statute, no other terms shall be used to identify classified information."  It has been CPSR's experience that agencies continue to use the designation "sensitive but unclassified" to invoke a national security concern when in fact there is no basis for such a claim and when such a "quasi-
classification" is disfavored by the Executive Order and contrary to the intent of the Computer Security Act.  In one instance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation specifically restricted public access to information regarding the development of certain computer systems because it designated technical documents "sensitive but unclassified."       We believe that these activities improperly restrict public access to government information that should otherwise be made available.  For this reason, we believe that a revised Executive Order should make very clear that classification authority is narrowly restricted.
     *  Classification authority must be narrowly construed and      invoked only pursuant to designated classification levels,      recognized by statute or executive order.
Limitations on Classification to Conceal Misconduct
     We are further concerned that Section 1.6(a)-(b) and Section 5.4(b)(2)(c) in the current Executive Order have not received adequate attention by the national security community.  Section 1.6(a) states that:
     In no case shall administrative information be      classified in order to conceal violations of law,      inefficiencies, or administrative error; to prevent      embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency; to      restrain competition; or to prevent or delay the release      of information that does not require protection in the      interest of national security.
Section 1.6(b) further states that "[b]asic scientific information not clearly related to the national security may not be Section 5.4 (Sanctions) states, in pertinent part, that:
     (b) Officers and employees of the United States      government and its contractors, licensees, and grantees      shall be subject to appropriate sanctions if they: . . .      (2) knowingly and willfully classify or continue the      classification of information in violation of this Order      or any implementing directive;
     (c) sanctions may include reprimand, suspension without      pay, removal, termination of classification authority,      loss or denial of access to classified information, or      other sanctions in accordance with applicable law and      agency regulation.
     As indicated above, it has been CPSR's experience that the National Security Agency sought to conceal its activities under the Computer Security Act through improper assertion of the (b)(1) exemption to the Freedom of Information Act.  It is clearly an improper use of classification authority to conceal agency conduct in this manner.  Such activities frustrate public oversight and permit the abuse of powers.
     Based on this experience, we make the following      *  ISOO should conduct an investigation to determine whether      the NSA's classification of documents regarding      cryptography was improper and, if so, whether sanctions are      appropriate for the agency officials involved.
     *  Any agency or government official exercising      classification authority with the intent of concealing      misconduct, inefficiencies or improper conduct should be      subject to sanctions and the ISOO should make known on an      annual basis its efforts to ensure that such activities do      not occur.
Implementation and Review
     It is also our belief that it would be appropriate to establish an independent commission on classification authority that would meet periodically to review the activities of the Information Security Oversight Office and to solicit public input on issues regarding information classification and national security.  Such a commission could include a representative of the National Security Council and the Director of the ISOO.  It would also include distinguished archivists, historians, journalists, librarians, scientists and academics.  Such a commission could provide ongoing oversight of the classification program and help ensure that future policies reflect the widespread needs of our country in information policy and the changing nature of our national security interest.
     We appreciate this opportunity to present our views and would be pleased to provide you with any additional information you might require.

Credit Reports and NS
Here is the letter opposing the provision to allow for easier access to
credit reports. As you can guess,  the Senate Intelligence Committee (which
generally acts as the biggest supporter of the agencies on the Hill) did not
address our concerns at all and approved the provision.
 I was unable to easily find the actualy text but will get it after I come
back from vacation.
                           July 12, 1993
 The Honorable Dennis Deconcini
 Chairman
 Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
 United States Senate
 SH-211 Hart Senate Office Building
 Washington, DC  20510-6475
 Dear Chairman DeConcini;
      We are writing to voice our strong opposition to the
 Administration's legislative proposal to amend the Fair Credit
 Reporting Act (FCRA) to allow the Federal Bureau of  Investigation
 (FBI) to obtain consumer credit reports in foreign
 counterintelligence cases.
      The FBI seeks a national security letter exemption to the
 FCRA to obtain personal information from consumer  reporting
 agencies without a subpoena or court order. A  national  security
 letter gives the FBI the authority to obtain records without
 judicial approval and without providing notice to the  individual
 that his or her records have been obtained by the Bureau.
 Similar FBT proposals were rejected in previous years  after
 Congressional leaders expressed concern over  the  civil  liberties
 issues raised.
      Although the current draft proposal is more comprehensive
 than those circulated in previous years, the changes and
 additions do not alter significantly the central character of  the
 proposal. The Administration's 1993 proposal  includes  explicit
 limits to'dissemination of obtained information within the
 goverrment, penalties for violations including punitive  damages,
 and reporting requirements.  These provisions are positive
 changes from the legislation put forward in previous years,  but
 they do not save the proposal from its intrinsic flaws.
      Therefore, the reasons for our fundamental opposition to  the
 current proposal remain the same: 1) the FBI has not  demonstrated
 a compelling need for access to consumer credit reports; and  2)
 legislation that implicates civil liberties should be  addressed
 separately and not as part of the authorization process.
       There are only two instances in which Congress has
 authorized the FBI, in counterintelligence investigations, to
 obtain information about individuals pursuant to a  national
 security letter but without a subpoena, search warrant or  court
 order. First, the Electronic Communications Privacy  Act  (ECPA)
 of 1986 included a provision requiring common carriers to
 disclose subscriber information and long distance toll records  to
 the FBI in response to a national security  letter.  Second,
 congress included in the 1987 Intelligence Authorization Act  an
  amendment to the Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) that
  requires banks to provide customer records to the FBI in  response
  to a similar letter. In that case, the FBI presented  to  Congress
  its case for obtaining financial records in foreign counter-
  intelligence cases and the difficulty of obtaining  those  records
  without a court order.
       in both instances when congress has previously  authorized
  the national security letter, Congress recognized that  the
  procedure departs dramatically from the procedure necessary  to
  obtain a court order.
        The FBI's current proposal seeks similar access to
  individuals' credit records held by consumer reporting  companies.
  The FBI has yet to adequately justify its need to add such  highly
  personal, sensitive information to the narrow category of  records
  subject to the national security letter exemption.
       The Bureau claims obtaining credit reports will allow  it  to
  more easily determine where a subject of an investigation  banks
  -- information the FBI claims will help them effectuate their
  ability to access bank records under the RFPA. We  opposed  the
  national security letter exemption in the RFPA and do not  endorse
  the FBI's slippery slope approach to ensuring that they  can  more
  easily obtain financial information in foreign
  counterintelligence cases. This information can be  and  is
  routinely gained without credit reports.  We do not believe
  convenience is a sufficient justification for this  significant
  exception to the law.
       The FBI further argues that obtaining banking  information
  through a credit report is preferred because it is  actually  leas
  intrusive than those investigative methods that would  otherwise
  be used.  While we too are frustrated that other information-
  gathering techniques are frequently too intrusive, our  objections
  to the other techniques do not lead us to endorse yet another
  technique that is also intrusive and that weakens  existing
  privacy law.
       Finally, we object to using the authorization process as  the
  vehicle for pursuing this change. The national  security  latter
  exemption, because it diminishes the due process and privacy
  protections for individuals, must be given the most careful
  consideration. The FBI's proposal should be  introduced  as
  separate legislation on which public hearings can  be  held.  only
  in this way can the Committee test thoroughly the FBI's  case  for
  the exemption and hear from witnesses who object to the change.
      We urge you to reject the FBI's proposal in its current
 form.  We are available to work with you on this issue.
                          Sincerely,

Call for Clipper Comments
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued a request for public comments on its proposal to establish the "Skipjack" key-escrow system as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS).  The deadline for the submission of comments is September 28, 1993.  The full text of the NIST notice CPSR is urging all interested individuals and organizations to express their views on the proposal and to submit comments directly to NIST.  Comments need not be lengthy or very detailed; all thoughtful statements addressing a particular concern will likely contribute to NIST's evaluation of the key-escrow proposal.  The following points could be raised about the NIST proposal
(additional materials on Clipper and the key escrow proposal may be found at the CPSR ftp site, cpsr.org):
* The potential risks of the proposal have not been assessed and many questions about the implementation remain unanswered.  The NIST notice states that the current proposal "does not include identification of key escrow agents who will hold the keys for the key escrow microcircuits or the procedures for access to the keys."  The key escrow configuration may also create a dangerous vulnerability in a communications network.  The risks of misuse of this feature should be weighed against any perceived benefit.
* The classification of the Skipjack algorithm as a "national security" matter is inappropriate for technology that will be used primarily in civilian and commercial applications.  Classification of technical information also limits the computing community's ability to evaluate fully the proposal and the general public's right to know about the activities of government.
* The proposal was not developed in response to a public concern or a business request.  It was put forward by the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation so that these two agencies could continue surveillance of electronic communications. It has not been established that is necessary for crime prevention.  The number of arrests resulting from wiretaps has remained essentially unchanged since the federal wiretap law was enacted in 1968.
* The NIST proposal states that the escrow agents will provide the key components to a government agency that "properly demonstrates legal authorization to conduct electronic surveillance of communications which are encrypted."  The crucial term "legal authorization" has not been defined.  The vagueness of the term "legal authorization" leaves open the possibility that court-
issued warrants may not be required in some circumstances.  This issue must be squarely addressed and clarified. * Adoption of the proposed key escrow standard may have an adverse impact upon the ability of U.S. manufacturers to market cryptographic products abroad.  It is unlikely that non-U.S. users would purchase communication security products to which the U.S. government holds keys.

Notice; request for comments.
SUMMARY: A Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for an Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) is being proposed. This proposed standard specifies use of a symmetric-key encryption/decryption algorithm and a key escrowing method which are to be implemented in electronic devices and used for protecting certain unclassified government communications when such protection is required. The algorithm and the key escrowing method are classified and are referenced, but not specified, in the standard.
   This proposed standard adopts encryption technology developed by the Federal government to provide strong protection for unclassified information and to enable the keys used in the encryption and decryption processes to be escrowed. This latter feature will assist law enforcement and other government agencies, under the proper legal authority, in the collection and decryption of electronically transmitted information. This proposed standard does not include identification of  key escrow  agents who will hold the keys for the  key escrow  microcircuits or the procedures for access to the keys. These issues will be addressed by the Department of Justice.
   The purpose of this notice is to solicit views from the public, manufacturers, and Federal, state, and local government users so that their needs can be considered prior to submission of this proposed standard to the Secretary of Commerce for review and    The proposed standard contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with the technical aspects of the standard. Both sections are provided in this DATES: Comments on this proposed standard must be received on or before September 28, 1993.
ADDRESSES: Written comments concerning the proposed standard should be sent to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN: Proposed FIPS for Escrowed Encryption Standard, Technology Building, room B-154, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
   Written comments received in response to this notice will be made part of the public record and will be made available for inspection and copying in the Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW., Washington, DC 20230.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Dennis Branstad, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975-2913.
   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed FIPS implements the initiative announced by the White House Office of the Press Secretary on April 16, 1993. The President of the U.S. approved a Public Encryption Management directive, which among other actions, called for standards to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted with  key-escrow  microcircuits in Federal communication systems that process sensitive, but unclassified information.

 Announcing the Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES)
   Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to section 111(d) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.
 Name of Standard: Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES).
 Category of Standard: Telecommunications Security.
 Explanation: This Standard specifies use of a symmetric-key encryption (and decryption) algorithm and a Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF) creation method (one part of a  key escrow  system) which provide for decryption of encrypted telecommunications when interception of the telecommunications is lawfully authorized. Both the algorithm and the LEAF creation method are to be implemented in electronic devices (e.g., very large scale integration chips). The devices may be incorporated in security equipment used to encrypt (and decrypt) sensitive unclassified telecommunications data. Decryption of lawfully intercepted telecommunications may be achieved through the acquisition and use of the LEAF, the decryption algorithm and escrowed key components.
   To escrow something (e.g., a document, an encryption key) means that it is "delivered to a third person to be given to the grantee only upon the fulfillment of a condition" (Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary). A key escrow  system is one that entrusts components of a key used to encrypt telecommunications to third persons, called key component escrow agents. In accordance with the common definition of "escrow", the key component escrow agents provide the key components to a "grantee" (i.e., a government agency) only upon fulfillment of the condition that the grantee properly demonstrates legal authorization to conduct electronic surveillance of communications which are encrypted using the specific device whose key component is requested. The key components obtained through this process are then used by the grantee to reconstruct the device unique key and obtain the session key (contained in the LEAF) which is used to decrypt the telecommunications that are encrypted with that device. The term, "escrow", for purposes of this standard, is restricted to the dictionary definition.
   The encryption/decryption algorithm has been approved for government applications requiring encryption of sensitive unclassified telecommunications of data as defined herein. The specific operations of the algorithm and the LEAF creation method are classified and hence are referenced, but not specified, in this standard.
   Data, for purposes of this standard, includes voice, facsimile and computer information communicated in a telephone system. Telephone system, for purposes of this standard, is limited to systems circuit-switched up to no more than 14.4 kbs or which use basic-rate ISDN, or to a similar grade wireless service.
   Data that is considered sensitive by a responsible authority should be encrypted if it is vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure during telecommunications. A risk analysis should be performed under the direction of a responsible authority to determine potential threats and risks. The costs of providing encryption using this standard as well as alternative methods and their respective costs should be projected. A responsible authority should then make a decision, based on the risk and cost analyses, whether or not to use encryption and then whether or not to use this standard.
 Approving Authority: Secretary of Commerce.
 Maintenance Agency: Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology.
 Applicability: This standard is applicable to all Federal departments and agencies and their contractors under the conditions specified below. This standard may be used in designing and implementing security products and systems which Federal departments and agencies use or operate or which are operated for them under contract. These products may be used when replacing Type II and Type III (DES) encryption devices and products owned by the government and government contractors.
   This standard may be used when the following conditions apply:
   1. An authorized official or manager responsible for data security or the security of a computer system decides that encryption is required and cost justified as per OMB Circular A-
130; and
   2. The data is not classified according to the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
   However, Federal departments or agencies which use encryption devices for protecting data that is classified according to either of these acts may use those devices also for protecting unclassified data in lieu of this standard.
   In addition, this standard may be adopted and used by non-
Federal Government organizations. Such use is encouraged when it provides the desired security.
Applications: Devices conforming to this standard may be used for protecting unclassified communications.
 Implementations: The encryption/decryption algorithm and the LEAF creation method shall be implemented in electronic devices (e.g., electronic chip packages) that can be physically protected against unauthorized entry, modification and reverse engineering. Implementations which are tested and validated by NIST will be considered as complying with this standard. An electronic device shall be incorporated into a cyptographic module in accordance with FIPS 140-1. NIST will test for conformance with FIPS 140-1. Cryptographic modules can then be integrated into security equipment for sale and use in an application. Information about devices that have been validated, procedures for testing equipment for conformance with NIST standards, and information about obtaining approval of security equipment are available from the Computer Systems Laboratory, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
 Export Control: Implementations of this standard are subject to Federal Government export controls as specified in title 22, Code of Federal Regulations, parts 120 through 131 (International Traffic of Arms Regulations -ITAR). Exporters of encryption devices, equipment and technical data are advised to contact the U.S. Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls for more information.   Patents: Implementations of this standard may be covered by U.S. and foreign patents.
 Implementation Schedule: This standard becomes effective thirty days following publication of this FIPS PUB.

 Specifications for the Escrowed Encryption Standard
 1. Introduction
   This publication specifies Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) functions and parameters.
 2. General
   This standard specifies use of the SKIPJACK cryptographic algorithm and the LEAF Creation Method 1 (LCM-1) to be implemented in an approved electronic device (e.g., a very large scale integration electronic chip). The device is contained in a logical cryptographic module which is then integrated in a security product for encrypting and decrypting telecommunications.
   Approved implementations may be procured by authorized organizations for integration into security equipment. Devices must be tested and validated by NIST for conformance to this standard. Cryptographic modules must be tested and validated by NIST for conformance to FIPS 140-1.
 3. Algorithm Specifications
   The specifications of the encryption/decryption algorithm (SKIPJACK) and the LEAF Creation Method 1 (LCM-1) are classified. The National Security Agency maintains these classified specifications and approves the manufacture of devices which implement the specifications. NIST tests for conformance of the devices implementing this standard in cryptographic modules to FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 81.
 4. Functions and Parameters
 4.1 Functions
   The following functions, at a minimum, shall be implemented:
   1. Data Encryption: A session key (80 bits) shall be used to encrypt plaintext information in one or more of the following modes of operation as specified in FIPS 81: ECB, CBC, OFB (64) CFB (1, 8, 16, 32, 64).
   2. Data Decryption: The session key (80 bits) used to encrypt the data shall be used to decrypt resulting ciphertext to obtain the data.
   3.  Key Escrow:  The Family Key (KF) shall be used to create the Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF) in accordance with the LEAF Creation Method 1 (LCM-1). The Session Key shall be encrypted with the Device Unique Key and transmitted as part of the LEAF. The security equipment shall ensure that the LEAF is transmitted in such a manner that the LEAF and ciphertext may be decrypted with legal authorization. No additional encryption or modification of the LEAF is permitted.
 4.2 Parameters
   The following parameters shall be used in performing the prescribed functions:
   1. Device Identifier (DID): The identifier unique to a particular device and used by the  Key Escrow  System.
   2. Device Unique Key (KU): The cryptographic key unique to a particular device and used by the  Key Escrow  System.
   3. Cryptographic Protocol Field (CPF): The field identifying the registered cryptographic protocol used by a particular application and used by the  Key Escrow  System (reserved for future specification and use).
   4. Escrow Authenticator (EA): A binary pattern that is inserted in the LEAF to ensure that the LEAF is transmitted and received properly and has not been modified, deleted or replaced in an unauthorized manner.
   5. Initialization Vector (IV): A mode and application dependent vector of bytes used to initialize, synchronize and verify the encryption, decryption and key escrow  functions.
   6. Family Key (KF): The cryptographic key stored in all devices designated as a family that is used to create the LEAF.
   7. Session Key (KS): The cryptographic key used by a device to encrypt and decrypt data during a session.    8. Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF): The field containing the encrypted session key and the device identifier and the escrow  5. Implementation
   The Cryptographic Algorithm and the LEAF Creation Method shall be implemented in an electronic device (e.g., VLSI chip) which is highly resistant to reverse engineering (destructive or non-
destructive) to obtain or modify the cryptographic algorithms, the DID, the KF, the KU, the EA, the CPF, the operational KS, or any other security or  Key Escrow  System relevant information. The device shall be able to be programmed/personalized (i.e., made unique) after mass production in such a manner that the DID, KU (or its components), KF (or its components) and EA fixed pattern can be entered once (and only once) and maintained without external electrical power.
   The LEAF and the IV shall be transmitted with the ciphertext. The specifics of the protocols used to create and transmit the LEAF, IV, and encrypted data shall be registered and a CPF assigned. The CPF shall then be transmitted in accordance with the registered specifications.
   The specific electric, physical and logical interface will vary with the implementation. Each approved, registered implementation shall have an unclassified electrical, physical and logical interface specification sufficient for an equipment manufacturer to understand the general requirements for using the device. Some of the requirements may be classified and therefore would not be specified in the unclassified interface specification.

HEADLINE: JAMES FLANIGAN:  BLAMING IMMIGRANTS WON'T SOLVE ECONOMIC WOES
BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN
 BODY:
   Immigration is a burning issue once again, with answers to perceived
coming thick and fast from public officials -- notably the governor of
California. But emotions outrun reason, and most people aren't even asking
right questions.
   Gov. Pete Wilson sent an open letter to President  Clinton  last week
demanding that the federal government control U.S. borders because
California is
suffering the burden of illegal immigration.
   Wilson also proposed tamper-proof identity  cards  for immigrants, denial
health care, education and even citizenship to children of illegal
and that Mexican soldiers join the U.S. Border Patrol in forcing people back
from the border
   Much of what he said, unfortunately, was demagoguery -- changing laws on
citizenship requires a Constitutional amendment, so lawyer Wilson's call was
political rhetoric.
   But not everything Wilson said was grandstanding; on some matters, he had
point, although like almost everybody involved in the new debate on
his complaints were misdirected.
   There are problems and social changes occurring in the U.S. economy, but
immigrants, legal and illegal, are not the cause of them. Yet illegal
immigration -- however great or small its actual numbers -- is a problem
because it breaks the law.
   So we should solve our problems, not avoid them by making scapegoats of
   To begin with, estimates vary incredibly about how big a "problem"
immigration is. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates
300,000 people enter the country illegally each year, but don't remain here.
Illegal aliens go back and forth between Mexico and the United States, says
   The  Clinton  White House recently estimated that 3 million people live
illegally, from many nations -- China, Mexico, Ireland, Nigeria, India --
and in
many parts of the country. That's less than half the widespread estimates,
by immigration critics, that more than 6 million illegals live in America.
   Legal immigration has risen in recent years thanks to a change in federal
law, but at 1.5 million immigrants a year, the rate is only half that of the
1900-1910 historic peak. In California, however, immigration is at peak
which helps account for this state's anxious reactions.
   The charge is that immigrants cost more in social services than they
contribute in economic benefit. But that's more an argument about taxation
immigration. A study by Los Angeles County found that immigrants pay
annually to the federal and state governments but little to the county,
provides hospital care and social services.
   The county's point, and one reason for Wilson's outburst last week, is
the federal government should pay more. "The federal government gets a free
ride," says Georges Vernez, an immigration expert at Rand Corp. the research
firm. Which is true, but that's not the immigrants' fault.
   The fact is, immigration answers needs in American society. If you don't
believe that, ask yourself why immigrants keep coming to a slow U.S. economy
and particularly to recession-bound California.
   The answer is they come for work. Skilled people the world over have an
invitation. American hospitals are still recruiting nurses from the
England and Ireland; draftsmen are brought from Europe, software programmers
from India.
   Unskilled people too find work. Consider the growing number of elder care
facilities in the United States, particularly those for elderly people
by Alzheimer's and other afflictions. They are staffed heavily by recent
immigrants who owe their unglamorous jobs to social changes in American
   "We do not live in extended families, three generations in one house, as
people in poorer countries do," explains Professor Leo Chavez of UC Irvine.
may be close as families but geographically separate, and so there is a
need for elder care facilities and staff to work in them.
   Couldn't low-skilled people from America's inner cities do such jobs?
they could, so why doesn't U.S. society train and educate people in its
cities and make sure they get such jobs? The answer is America's inner-city
problem is a complex one of social neglect. But making scapegoats of
won't solve it.
   Make no mistake, "America should control its borders, because lawlessness
always a problem," says Julian Simon, of the University of Maryland, a
authority on immigration.
   Trouble is, most suggestions for controlling the border are unacceptable.
Guns won't do it -- can you imagine the public outcry the first time U.S. or
Mexican troops shoot down defenseless migrants?
   We could try an identity  card,  but surely our laws would demand that
everyone carry such a  card.  And a country that has a hard time imposing
minimal gun control won't soon have a national ID  card.    One way to gain border control and economic benefit would be to set up a
system of flexible legal immigration that could bring people in when needed
for a variety of jobs. Immigration experts say this might be along the lines of
the bracero program that brought agricultural laborers from Mexico from
1942 to 1964. The bracero program had faults and was criticized as a
scheme, but a new system would have the advantage of being legal and less
   Another solution, for our southern border, would be to work through the
American Free Trade Agreement to improve Mexico's economy and ease at least
economic pressures driving Mexico's people north.
   The ultimate point, though, is we'll get nowhere blaming our problems on
immigrants, who have always come to this country just because it offers more
opportunity for individual development than any other nation on earth.
   "Only in America," President  Clinton  said last week as he nominated
Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, who came from Poland as a child, to be chairman
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Shalikashvili will succeed Colin Powell, the son
immigrants from Jamaica. Only in America -- still true, and hopefully always

HEADLINE:  CLINTON  REPORTED LOOKING AT NATIONAL ID  CARD DATELINE: LOS ANGELES
 BODY:
   President  Clinton  said in an interview published Friday that his
administration is studying the feasibility of creating a tamper-proof
identity  card  aimed in part at preventing illegal immigrants from using
government benefit programs.
   Though civil liberties groups have strongly opposed similar plans in the
past,  Clinton  told the  Los Angeles Times  he now believed the idea "ought
be examined."
   But  Clinton  said he disagreed with a proposal presented earlier this
by California Gov. Pete Wilson for constitutional changes that would deny
citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants.
   He said he was also against Wilson's recommendation that emergency
treatment should be shut off to undocumented residents. Such a policy, he
suggested, would create more problems than it solves.
   "None of us would tolerate just letting people die on the streets if it
to that,"  Clinton  was quoted as saying.
   In the midst of a growing anti-immigrant backlash nationwide, Wilson
called for sweeping reforms in federal laws to help stem the flow of illegal
immigrants into the United States.
   But immigrant rights advocates accused him of trying to make Mexican
immigrants a scapegoat for his own failure to solve the state's crushing
economic problems.
   Wilson's package included a proposed tamper-proof identity  card, and  Clinton's  disclosure was the first indication that it was under

years to block the development of such a  card,  arguing that it would give
government too much control over individuals.

care to treat people who have communicable diseases.

statement expressing the problems that the Clipper is supposed to solve, the
need to look for possible alternatives to the proposal,  the legal,

NIST Comment Deadline
The September 28 deadline for the submission of comments on NIST's proposal to establish the "Skipjack" key-escrow system as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is rapidly approaching.  The full text of the NIST Federal Register notice CPSR is urging all interested individuals and organizations to express their views on the proposal and to submit comments directly to NIST.  Comments need not be lengthy or very detailed; all thoughtful statements addressing a particular concern will likely contribute to NIST's evaluation of the key-escrow proposal.  The following points could be raised about the NIST proposal
(additional materials on Clipper and the key escrow proposal, including
comments already submitted to NIST,  may be found at the CPSR ftp site,
cpsr.org /cpsr/crypto/clipper):
* The potential risks of the proposal have not been assessed and many questions about the implementation remain unanswered.  The NIST notice states that the current proposal "does not include identification of key escrow agents who will hold the keys for the key escrow microcircuits or the procedures for access to the keys."  The key escrow configuration may also create a dangerous vulnerability in a communications network.  The risks of misuse of this feature should be weighed against any perceived benefit.
* The classification of the Skipjack algorithm as a "national security" matter is inappropriate for technology that will be used primarily in civilian and commercial applications.  Classification of technical information also limits the computing community's ability to evaluate fully the proposal and the general public's right to know about the activities of government.
* The proposal was not developed in response to a public concern or a business request.  It was put forward by the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation so that these two agencies could continue surveillance of electronic communications. It has not been established that is necessary for crime prevention.  The number of arrests resulting from wiretaps has remained essentially unchanged since the federal wiretap law was enacted in 1968.
* The NIST proposal states that the escrow agents will provide the key components to a government agency that "properly demonstrates legal authorization to conduct electronic surveillance of communications which are encrypted."  The crucial term "legal authorization" has not been defined.  The vagueness of the term "legal authorization" leaves open the possibility that court-
issued warrants may not be required in some circumstances.  This issue must be squarely addressed and clarified. * Adoption of the proposed key escrow standard may have an adverse impact upon the ability of U.S. manufacturers to market cryptographic products abroad.  It is unlikely that non-U.S. users would purchase communication security products to which the U.S. government holds keys.

Notice; request for comments.
SUMMARY: A Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for an Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) is being proposed. This proposed standard specifies use of a symmetric-key encryption/decryption algorithm and a key escrowing method which are to be implemented in electronic devices and used for protecting certain unclassified government communications when such protection is required. The algorithm and the key escrowing method are classified and are referenced, but not specified, in the standard.
   This proposed standard adopts encryption technology developed by the Federal government to provide strong protection for unclassified information and to enable the keys used in the encryption and decryption processes to be escrowed. This latter feature will assist law enforcement and other government agencies, under the proper legal authority, in the collection and decryption of electronically transmitted information. This proposed standard does not include identification of  key escrow  agents who will hold the keys for the  key escrow  microcircuits or the procedures for access to the keys. These issues will be addressed by the Department of Justice.

 Announcing the Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES)
   Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to section 111(d) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.
 Name of Standard: Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES).
 Category of Standard: Telecommunications Security.
 Explanation: This Standard specifies use of a symmetric-key encryption (and decryption) algorithm and a Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF) creation method (one part of a  key escrow  system) which provide for decryption of encrypted telecommunications when interception of the telecommunications is lawfully authorized. Both the algorithm and the LEAF creation method are to be implemented in electronic devices (e.g., very large scale integration chips). The devices may be incorporated in security equipment used to encrypt (and decrypt) sensitive unclassified telecommunications data. Decryption of lawfully intercepted telecommunications may be achieved through the acquisition and use of the LEAF, the decryption algorithm and escrowed key components.
   To escrow something (e.g., a document, an encryption key) means that it is "delivered to a third person to be given to the grantee only upon the fulfillment of a condition" (Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary). A key escrow  system is one that entrusts components of a key used to encrypt telecommunications to third persons, called key component escrow agents. In accordance with the common definition of "escrow", the key component escrow agents provide the key components to a "grantee" (i.e., a government agency) only upon fulfillment of the condition that the grantee properly demonstrates legal authorization to conduct electronic surveillance of communications which are encrypted using the specific device whose key component is requested. The key components obtained through this process are then used by the grantee to reconstruct the device unique key and obtain the session key (contained in the LEAF) which is used to decrypt the telecommunications that are encrypted with that device. The term, "escrow", for purposes of this standard, is restricted to the dictionary definition.
   The encryption/decryption algorithm has been approved for government applications requiring encryption of sensitive unclassified telecommunications of data as defined herein. The specific operations of the algorithm and the LEAF creation method are classified and hence are referenced, but not specified, in this standard.
   Data, for purposes of this standard, includes voice, facsimile and computer information communicated in a telephone system. Telephone system, for purposes of this standard, is limited to systems circuit-switched up to no more than 14.4 kbs or which use basic-rate ISDN, or to a similar grade wireless service.
   Data that is considered sensitive by a responsible authority should be encrypted if it is vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure during telecommunications. A risk analysis should be performed under the direction of a responsible authority to determine potential threats and risks. The costs of providing encryption using this standard as well as alternative methods and their respective costs should be projected. A responsible authority should then make a decision, based on the risk and cost analyses, whether or not to use encryption and then whether or not to use this standard.
 Approving Authority: Secretary of Commerce.
 Maintenance Agency: Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology.
 Applicability: This standard is applicable to all Federal departments and agencies and their contractors under the conditions specified below. This standard may be used in designing and implementing security products and systems which Federal departments and agencies use or operate or which are operated for them under contract. These products may be used when replacing Type II and Type III (DES) encryption devices and products owned by the government and government contractors.
   This standard may be used when the following conditions apply:
   1. An authorized official or manager responsible for data security or the security of a computer system decides that encryption is required and cost justified as per OMB Circular A-
130; and
   2. The data is not classified according to the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
   However, Federal departments or agencies which use encryption devices for protecting data that is classified according to either of these acts may use those devices also for protecting unclassified data in lieu of this standard.
   In addition, this standard may be adopted and used by non-
Federal Government organizations. Such use is encouraged when it provides the desired security.
Applications: Devices conforming to this standard may be used for protecting unclassified communications.
 Implementations: The encryption/decryption algorithm and the LEAF creation method shall be implemented in electronic devices (e.g., electronic chip packages) that can be physically protected against unauthorized entry, modification and reverse engineering. Implementations which are tested and validated by NIST will be considered as complying with this standard. An electronic device shall be incorporated into a cyptographic module in accordance with FIPS 140-1. NIST will test for conformance with FIPS 140-1. Cryptographic modules can then be integrated into security equipment for sale and use in an application. Information about devices that have been validated, procedures for testing equipment for conformance with NIST standards, and information about obtaining approval of security equipment are available from the Computer Systems Laboratory, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
 Export Control: Implementations of this standard are subject to Federal Government export controls as specified in title 22, Code of Federal Regulations, parts 120 through 131 (International Traffic of Arms Regulations -ITAR). Exporters of encryption devices, equipment and technical data are advised to contact the U.S. Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls for more information.   Patents: Implementations of this standard may be covered by U.S. and foreign patents.
 Implementation Schedule: This standard becomes effective thirty days following publication of this FIPS PUB.

 Specifications for the Escrowed Encryption Standard
 1. Introduction
   This publication specifies Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) functions and parameters.
 2. General
   This standard specifies use of the SKIPJACK cryptographic algorithm and the LEAF Creation Method 1 (LCM-1) to be implemented in an approved electronic device (e.g., a very large scale integration electronic chip). The device is contained in a logical cryptographic module which is then integrated in a security product for encrypting and decrypting telecommunications.
   Approved implementations may be procured by authorized organizations for integration into security equipment. Devices must be tested and validated by NIST for conformance to this standard. Cryptographic modules must be tested and validated by NIST for conformance to FIPS 140-1.
 3. Algorithm Specifications
   The specifications of the encryption/decryption algorithm (SKIPJACK) and the LEAF Creation Method 1 (LCM-1) are classified. The National Security Agency maintains these classified specifications and approves the manufacture of devices which implement the specifications. NIST tests for conformance of the devices implementing this standard in cryptographic modules to FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 81.
 4. Functions and Parameters
 4.1 Functions
   The following functions, at a minimum, shall be implemented:
   1. Data Encryption: A session key (80 bits) shall be used to encrypt plaintext information in one or more of the following modes of operation as specified in FIPS 81: ECB, CBC, OFB (64) CFB (1, 8, 16, 32, 64).
   2. Data Decryption: The session key (80 bits) used to encrypt the data shall be used to decrypt resulting ciphertext to obtain the data.
   3.  Key Escrow:  The Family Key (KF) shall be used to create the Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF) in accordance with the LEAF Creation Method 1 (LCM-1). The Session Key shall be encrypted with the Device Unique Key and transmitted as part of the LEAF. The security equipment shall ensure that the LEAF is transmitted in such a manner that the LEAF and ciphertext may be decrypted with legal authorization. No additional encryption or modification of the LEAF is permitted.
 4.2 Parameters
   The following parameters shall be used in performing the prescribed functions:
   1. Device Identifier (DID): The identifier unique to a particular device and used by the  Key Escrow  System.
   2. Device Unique Key (KU): The cryptographic key unique to a particular device and used by the  Key Escrow  System.
   3. Cryptographic Protocol Field (CPF): The field identifying the registered cryptographic protocol used by a particular application and used by the  Key Escrow  System (reserved for future specification and use).
   4. Escrow Authenticator (EA): A binary pattern that is inserted in the LEAF to ensure that the LEAF is transmitted and received properly and has not been modified, deleted or replaced in an unauthorized manner.
   5. Initialization Vector (IV): A mode and application dependent vector of bytes used to initialize, synchronize and verify the encryption, decryption and key escrow  functions.
   6. Family Key (KF): The cryptographic key stored in all devices designated as a family that is used to create the LEAF.
   7. Session Key (KS): The cryptographic key used by a device to encrypt and decrypt data during a session.    8. Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF): The field containing the encrypted session key and the device identifier and the escrow  5. Implementation
   The Cryptographic Algorithm and the LEAF Creation Method shall be implemented in an electronic device (e.g., VLSI chip) which is highly resistant to reverse engineering (destructive or non-
destructive) to obtain or modify the cryptographic algorithms, the DID, the KF, the KU, the EA, the CPF, the operational KS, or any other security or  Key Escrow  System relevant information. The device shall be able to be programmed/personalized (i.e., made unique) after mass production in such a manner that the DID, KU (or its components), KF (or its components) and EA fixed pattern can be entered once (and only once) and maintained without external electrical power.
   The LEAF and the IV shall be transmitted with the ciphertext. The specifics of the protocols used to create and transmit the LEAF, IV, and encrypted data shall be registered and a CPF assigned. The CPF shall then be transmitted in accordance with the registered specifications.
   The specific electric, physical and logical interface will vary with the implementation. Each approved, registered implementation shall have an unclassified electrical, physical and logical interface specification sufficient for an equipment manufacturer to understand the general requirements for using the device. Some of the requirements may be classified and therefore would not be specified in the unclassified interface specification.

[1] Administration Continues NII Initiative
Following the announcement of the "The National Information
Infrastructure: Agenda for Action" in mid-September, the Administration
is pushing forward the NII program.  An open forum was held at the
Department of Commerce at the end of September with high ranking
officials, private sector representatives, and public advocates
exchanging views on the NII program.  The National Telecommunications
and Information Administration is planning a series of hearings later
this year on an updated concept of "universal service," and the
Information Infrastructure Task Force working group on privacy has
already held several meetings to examine privacy implications of the NII
To obtain a copy of the NII report, FTP the document from
ftp.ntia.doc.gov. Log in as "anonymous" with the password "guest" and

[2] Clinton Issues FOIA Directive
Noting that "openness in government is essential to accountability,"
President Clinton issued a memorandum to all federal agencies on October
4 directing them to comply with "both the letter and spirit" of the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Clinton noted that the FOIA "is a
vital part of the participatory system of government" and stated that "I
am committed to enhancing its effectiveness in my Administration."  The
President also urged federal agencies "to enhance public access through
the use of electronic information systems."
The Clinton memorandum is a marked departure from directives issued
during the Reagan and Bush Administrations, when most official
pronouncements on FOIA tended to discourage agency disclosures.
Attorney General Janet Reno simultaneously rescinded the Justice
Department's 1981 guidelines for the defense of federal agencies in FOIA
litigation.  Under those guidelines, issued in the early months of the
Reagan administration, the Department defended agency decisions to
withhold information if there was merely a "substantial legal basis" for
the withholding.  Under the new Reno guidelines, the Department will
only defend FOIA actions in which agencies can demonstrate that
disclosure would result in some specific harm.  Under the new policy,
"Where an item of information might technically or arguably fall within
an exemption, it ought not to be withheld from a FOIA requester unless
it need be."  The Attorney General directed that all pending FOIA cases
be reviewed to determine compliance with the new policy and also called
for a government-wide review of processing "backlogs" that have resulted
in substantial delays in the disclosure of requested information.
CPSR has several FOIA cases pending in federal court and has long urged
that the federal information disclosure process be reformed to maximize
the disclosure of requested agency records. The NII initiative also
provide an opportunity to improve citizen access to government
information. A copy of the White House and Atty General's memos is
available at the CPSR Internet Library /cpsr/foia/clinton_foia_10_93.txt.
     -------------------------------------------------------------
[3] Health Care Reform and Privacy
The recently released President's Health Security Plan includes
important new provisions on privacy protection.  The plan recommends new
federal legislation based on a Code of Fair Information Practices.
Currently, there is no federal protection for medical records.
The new proposal also includes a provision for a national medical
identity card, which is described in the plan as "like ATM cards, the
health security card allows access to information about health coverage
through an integrated national network. The card itself contains a
minimal amount of information."
President Clinton was asked about the privacy implications of the
medical security card at a town hall meeting in Sacramento, CA on
October 4.  He replied that the card will be used to ensure that in an
emergency that a person could be identified and that it "will have the
same sort of protections that a Social Security card would..." He
recalled opposition to the past attempts to expand the use of the SSN
and noted that the card was only "for the purposes of establishing that
you belong to the health care system."
Another important aspect of the proposal is the identifying number. The
proposal calls for  the establishment of "a system of universal
identifiers for the health care system." The proposal notes that "The
unique identifier may be the Social Security Number or a newly created
number limited to the health care system...In either case, the national
privacy policy explicitly forbids the linking of health care and other
information through the identification number."   This will be
determined by the National Health Board.
In April 1992  CPSR sent a letter to Hillary Clinton with the
endorsement of over two dozen privacy and computer experts requesting
that  the SSN not be used as  the identifier.  The letter cited privacy,
security, and fraud problems and pointed out that other countries, such
as Canada, have created limited purpose identifiers for medical record
Other Privacy Provisions
o The creation of mechanisms for effective enforcement including
significant penalties.
o Establishing a privacy framework based on the Code of Fair Information
Practices including a right to know about and approve the uses of the
data, assurance of no secret data systems, right to review and correct
data, assurances that the data is only collected for legitimate
o Issue effective security standards and guidance for health care
o Establishing as Data Protection and Security Panel to set privacy and
security standards and monitor implementation of the standards, sponsor
of conduct research, studies and investigations, and developing of fair
consent forms.

[4] CPSR Panel on Health Care and Privacy
CPSR Annual Meeting - Sunday Evening - Special Session - Free to the
general public
7:30 - 9:30  Special Panel Discussion "Health Care Reform and the
National Information Infrastructure: Opportunities and Risks"
The White House Task Force on Health Care reform has called for the
development of community-based health data-management systems. A working
paper from the task force notes: "Workgroup has vision for a community
health information systems (CHIS) based on a computerized medical
record. The CHIS will link all key parties in the healthcare delivery
systems and service all their clinical and administrative requirements."
The task force has estimated that the following areas: 1. Medical
Electronic Data Interchange networking 2. Community Health Information
Networks 3. Outcomes Analysis and 4. Computerized Patient Records. offer
the near term potential (less than 5 years) to save 100 billion dollars
a year via the development of standards, administrative reform, and
federal leadership in using the existing networking infrastructure to
promote electronic medical commerce. However, with these opportunities
for improved efficiency and cost containment come risks - specifically
privacy and access.
The panel will include experts in medical information systems and
privacy advocates. Come and learn about this important area. Join in
this national discussion. Be part of the solution.

        Envisioning the Future: A National Forum on the
    National Information Infrastructure and Community Access
The National Information Infrastructure (NII) is the proposed medium or
"electronic highway" that will connect schools, libraries, government
agencies, and citizens using state-of-the-art computer and
communications technology.  Media, computer, and telecommunications
companies are also acutely interested in the NII as it dramatically
increases their opportunity for delivery of communication, services, and
entertainment. CPSR is convening this meeting for both computer
professionals and the informed public to discuss the broad range of
choices facing society regarding the NII.
Saturday, October 16
Keynote Address - Bruce McConnell, Office of Management and Budget
           "Shaping National Information Infrastructure Policy"
Bruce McConnell, Chief of Information Policy at the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB), will present his views on the major NII issues now facing
the administration.  He has been with OMB since 1985 and became head of
Information Policy in 1992.  He now chairs the inter-agency task force
responsible for developing federal information policy for the
Information Infrastructure Task Force.
Other Panels:
                      "Public Access to Internetworks"
Public access to the Internet (and other major networks) is a critical
issue in any discussion about an "electronic highway".  Panelists
representing a wide variety of perspectives, including representatives
from the Pacific Northwest, will present their views.
                   "Municipal Information Infrastructure"
City and other government agencies are exploring possibilities for
developing municipal networks.  In this panel a city official as well as
a representative from the state regulatory agency and a representative
of commercial interests will offer their insights and interests.
                       "Networking in the Community"
Community networks exist and are being developed all over the U.S.
Panelists from various community networks will present their
perspectives on the state of community networking now and in the future.
             "Computers and Democracy - What's the Connection?"
How might computers facilitate the democratic process?  How might they
pervert it?  "Electronic Democracy" is currently in the public eye and
aspects of it will probably be tested soon.  What can be done to promote
wise uses of computers in this critical area?

     COMPUTER SCIENTISTS RAISE SOCIAL AND DESIGN CONCERNS
                     ABOUT THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY
Palo Alto, Calif., October 25, 1993  --  In the wake of sudden corporate mergers and rapid technological developments, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today voiced concern that the planned information superhighway will not realize its full potential.  The public interest organization put forward specific guidelines for the National Information Infrastructure (NII) in a paper titled, "Serving the Community:  A Public-Interest Vision of the National Information Infrastructure."  Urging the Clinton Administration to move quickly to adopt these principles, CPSR President Eric Roberts said, "Although there is widespread agreement on general goals, there is no specific plan to ensure that these goals are met."
"It is much easier to state a vision than to achieve it, " said Dr. Roberts, who is also Associate Chair of the Computer Science department at Stanford University.  "And there are many dangers on the horizon that threaten to compromise the value of the NII as a resource for the public.  "For example, if a small number of companies dominate the market, we're in danger of stifling competition and innovation on the network.  If those same companies control the programming, then open and diverse speech is limited.  If pricing structures do not cover universal service, the average person and the poor will be struggling to use the backroads of the information highway.  If privacy isn't protected, your TV could keep more detailed records of your finances than the IRS.  And, if the NII is not designed to allow everyone to communicate freely and to publish their own contributions, it could become nothing more than a medium for delivering 500-channel television, with interactivity limited to home-shopping and trying to guess the next play during sporting events."
CPSR's paper expands on these dangers and makes specific policy and technical recommendations for the newly formed Information Infrastructure Task Force.  The Task Force is expected to coordinate network policy for the Clinton Administration.  "In its 'Agenda for Action' document, the Administration has set forth a positive vision of what the NII can be," said Dr. Roberts.  "To achieve that vision, however, the government must play a major role in the design, development, and regulation of the network."  CPSR recommends that the Administration adopt the following policies:
o   Promote widespread economic benefits by evaluating the NII's     economic success using measures that reflect its impact on the     society as a whole, not merely the profits of NII investors and     service providers.
o   Evaluate the social impact of the NII by conducting periodic     reviews as the NII is implemented and used to guarantee that it    continues to serve the public interest.
o   Guarantee equitable and universal access through an appropriate     mix of legislation, regulation, taxation, and direct subsidies.
o   Promote the development of a vital civic sector by ensuring     resources, training, and support for public spaces within the NII     where citizens can pursue noncommercial activities.
o   Promote a diverse and competitive marketplace in terms of the     content carried over the NII.
o   Provide access to government services and information over the     NII.
o   Encourage democratic participation by ensuring full public     disclosure, and actively promoting democratic decision-making     and public participation in all stages of the development process.
o   Actively facilitate the seamless connection of America's NII with     the information infrastructures of other nations by working to     resolve such issues as security, censorship, tariffs, and privacy.
o   Guarantee the functional integrity of the NII by establishing     critical technical requirements including ease of use, widespread     availability, full functionality, high reliability, adequate privacy     protection, and evolutionary expansion.
The recommendations follow from a yearlong review of the NII conducted by CPSR.  The process included collecting more than 1,200 suggestions for NII policy from network users across the country, drafting a report, holding special chapter meetings on the NII in Berkeley, Boston, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., and having a multiple-draft review process by the membership.  Final changes to the report were made at the annual meeting of CPSR, where the report was adopted unanimously by the CPSR Board of Directors.
Dr. Roberts noted that he was very pleased by the level of participation in the NII report.  "The computer community knows that the NII is the critical technological issue facing the United States today.  Our members were extremely responsive when we asked them to participate in this project, because they understand from their own experience how much the NII has to offer."
CPSR also worked closely with the Telecommunications Policy Roundtable (TPR), a coalition of more than sixty nonprofit, consumer, labor and civil rights organizations based in Washington, DC.  CPSR's paper endorses the principles set forth by TPR.  TPR will unveil its founding principles in a press conference, Tuesday, October 26th at 10:00 a.m. at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.
CPSR is planning a conference next April in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the future of the NII, The Directions and Implications of Advanced Computing.  The conference will investigate at a more specific level how to achieve the principles in the CPSR report.
Founded in 1981, CPSR is a national, nonprofit, public interest organization of computer professionals and others concerned with the impact of computer technology on society.  With offices in Palo Alto, California, and Washington D.C., and 22 chapters across the country, CPSR works to encourage public discussion of decisions involving the use of computers in systems critical to society and to challenge the assumption that technology alone can solve political and social problems.

[1]  FBI's Operation "Root Canal" Documents Disclosed
In response to a CPSR Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, the FBI this
week released 185 pages of documents concerning the Bureau's Digital
Telephony Initiative,  code-named Operation "Root Canal." The newly
disclosed material raises serious doubts as to the accuracy of the
FBI's claim that advances in telecommunications technology have
hampered law enforcement efforts to execute court-authorized wiretaps.
The FBI documents reveal that the Bureau initiated a well- orchestrated
public relations campaign in support of "proposed legislation to compel
telecommunications industry cooperation in assuring our digital
telephony intercept requirements are met."  A May 26, 1992, memorandum
from the Director of the FBI to the Attorney General lays out a
"strategy ... for gaining support for the bill once it reaches
Congress," including the following:
     "Each FBI Special Agent in Charge's contacting key law
     enforcement and prosecutorial officials in his/her territory
     to stress the urgency of Congress's being sensitized to this
     critical issue;
     Field Office media representatives educating their contacts
     by explaining and documenting, in both local and national
     dimensions, the crisis facing law enforcement and the need
     for legislation; and
     Gaining the support of the professional associations
     representing law enforcement and prosecutors."
However, despite efforts to obtain documentation from the field in
support of Bureau claims of a "crisis facing law enforcement," the
response from FBI Field Offices was that they experienced *no*
difficulty in conducting electronic surveillance.  For example, a
December 3, 1992, memorandum from Newark reported the following:
     The Newark office of the Drug Enforcement Administration
     "advised that as of this date, the DEA has not had any
     technical problems with advanced telephone technology."
     The New Jersey Attorney General's Office "has not experienced
     any problems with the telephone company since the last
     contact."
     An agent from the Newark office of the Internal Revenue
     Service "advised that since the last time he was contacted,
     his unit has not had any problems with advanced telephony
     matters."
     An official of the New Jersey State Police "advised that
     as of this date he has had no problems with the present
     technology hindering his investigations."
Likewise, a memorandum from the Philadelphia Field Office reported that
the local offices of the IRS, Customs Service and the Secret Service
were contacted and "experienced no difficulties with new technologies."
Indeed, the newly-released documents contain no reports of *any*
technical problems in the field.
The documents also reveal the FBI's critical role in the development of
the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), a cryptographic means of
authenticating electronic communications that the National Institute of
Standards and Technology was expected to develop.  The DSS was proposed
in August 1991 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
NIST later acknowledged that the National Security Agency developed the
standard.  The newly disclosed documents appear to confirm speculation
that the  FBI and the NSA worked to undermine the legal authority of
the NIST to develop standards for the nation's communications
CPSR intends to pursue further FOIA litigation to establish the extent
of the FBI involvement in the development of the DSS and also to obtain
a "cost-benefit" study discussed in one of the FBI Director's memos and
other documents the Bureau continues to withhold.
       -------------------------------------------------------------
[2] GAO Report Criticizes Gov't Crypto Policy
A Government Accounting Office report has found that government
policies are hindering the development of encryption technology at the
same time the industry is threatened by economic espionage because of
computer networks lacking adequate security.  The report was requested
by House Judiciary Chair Jack Brooks.
The report _Communications Privacy: Federal Policy and Actions_
(GAO/OSI-94-2) also found that NIST followed the NSA's lead in
developing cryptographic standards for communications privacy and that
there has been little public input in this process. NIST terminated a
project in 1982 to develop a public key encryption system at the
request of NSA and in 1991 introduced a NSA developed standard for
digital signatures. In addition, no public input was solicited for the
Clipper Chip proposal until 1993, over three years after the initiation
of its development.
The report also noted the wide range of software and hardware available
outside the US and that the continued export controls are apparently
more stringent than those in other countries. This is apparently
hurting sales of U.S. software and hardware products worldwide.
Congressman Brooks said that "[I]t is deeply disturbing to find that
some U.S. government agencies are undermining American corporations
efforts to protect themselves from state-sponsored theft of trade
secrets and other propriety information." Brooks also stated that "The
plain truth is that encryption devices and software are available
around the world. The barn door is open; the horses are out. It is high
time for the government to accept this fact of life and stop hog-tying
U.S. industry with overly restrictive export controls that damage this
country's effort to compete in the global marketplace."
The GAO report is available at the CPSR Internet Library (see below).

[3] Health Care Reform Plan Released Amidst Growing Concern About
Medical Privacy
The Clinton health care reform plan was released the same week that a
new Lou Harris poll found high levels of concern about privacy among
the American public. The health care reform proposal includes important
privacy safeguards, but the measures may not go far enough to address
public concerns.
The Harris poll reveals that Americans are very much concerned about
medical record privacy.  The poll conducted by Prof. Alan Westin found
that 49 percent of all Americans are very concerned and 30 percent are
somewhat concerned by the threats to their personal privacy. An
additional 56 percent believe that strong federal protection of medical
records is necessary to accomplish health care reform.
The health care reform proposal includes a strong code of fair
information practices, and an explicit prohibitions on the use of
medical record information for employment purposes.  But the plan
leaves open the question of whether the Social Security Number might be
used as a patient identifier and also allows more than three years
before full legislative safeguards are established.
At a conference organized by the US Office of Consumer Affairs, CPSR
Washington Office Director Marc Rotenberg and ACLU Privacy and
Technology Project Director Janlori Goldman said that the health care
reform plan raises far-reaching privacy concerns that must be addressed
at the outset.
The Office of Technology Assessment released a new report on medical
records and  privacy at a Congressional hearing held by Rep. Gary
Condit (D-CA). "Protecting Privacy in Computerized Medical Information"
explores the implications of the  automation of health care information
and recommends federal legislation to  address patient confidentiality
and privacy.
An electronic copy  is  available at the CPSR Internet Library. (see
below for location details).
Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) recently held a hearing to explore the
privacy implications of medical smart cards.  The Senator plans to hold
a second hearing on medical record privacy later this year.

of computer crime. He will serve a minimum ten months before he is
eligible for release. He is also required to serve three years
probation and to do 600 hours of community service.
Abene pled guilty to two counts of computer intrusion in July relating
to incidents of break-ins at a NY television station and a Southwestern

Cantwell Introduces "Encryption" bill to Expand Export Markets for US
Computer and Software Companies
   US Rep. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) has introduced legislation to amend the
Export Administration Act to allow US computer and software
manufacturers to compete in an international market that could mean as
much as $6 billion to $9 billion a year to American high-tech
industries. Cantwell's bill would liberalize export controls on software
that features encryption capabilities, which protect computer data
against unauthorized disclosure, theft or alteration.
   As communications systems link more and more computers and telephones
around the world, Cantwell said, businesses and indviduals are becoming
more concerned about protecting the privacy of their electronic files,
messages and transactions. She said the worldwide demand for
cryptographic software, and computer systems that employ such software,
is growing rapidly and American companies must be allowed to meet that
demand. According to Cantwell, this legislation is needed to ensure that
American companies do not lose critical international markets to foreign
competitors, who operate with few export restrictions. Currently, more
than 200 software and hardware products for text, file and data
encryption are available from 20 foreign countries.
   "The Export Administration Act has erected a wall between American
high-tech companies and their international customers -- it's time to
lower the wall," Cantwell said. "Computer and software technology are
among the most competitive fields in the world, and American companies
are the clear leaders. To maintain that lead, American companies must be
able to respond to worldwide consumer demand."
   Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance, an
association of America's nine leading software companies, applauded
Cantwell for introducing the leigslation and said the bill would "assist
US software companies and maintaining their competitive edge in
international markets."
   Dr. Nathan Myhrvold, senior vice president for Advance Technology at
Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Washington, also praised Cantwell for
her leadership on this issue.
   "The ability to include encryption features in software we sell
worldwide is important to our remaining competititve in foreign
markets," Myhrvold said.  " We commend Rep. Cantwell for recognizing the
importance of this issue to the American software industry."
CANTWELL ON EXPORT CONTROLS/ ADD ONE
    Cantwell said current export controls that prohibit the export of
American software programs that offer good encryption capabilities only
make it harder for American companies to compete internationally.  She
said the regulations ignore the realities of today's post-Cold War
global economy and the needs of one of this country's most innovative
and successful industries.  American software companies currently
command a 75 percent worldwide market share, and many of those companies
earn more than 50 percent of their annual revenues from exports, but
Cantwell said that could change quickly.
     "The United States' export control system is broken and needs to be
fixed," Cantwell said.  "It was designed as a tool of the Cold War, to
help America fight against enemies that no longer exist.  If we continue
to prevent American companies from meeting the worldwide demand for
cryptographic software, America gains nothing -- but those companies
stand to lose $6 billion and $9 billion a year."
     Paul Brainerd, CEO of Aldus in Seattle, said, "Rep. Cantwell's bill
would liberalize outdated export controls, which are threatening the
continued success of America's software companies in world markets.  In
order to remain competitive worldwide, American companies must be able
to offer features -- like information security -- demanded by our
customers and available from foreign companies."
     Cantwell said her legislation would not interfere with the
government's ability to control exports to nations with terrorist
tendencies (such as Iran, Libya and Syria) or other embargoed countries
(such as Cuba and North Korea).  On the other hand, she said, current
export controls on American software do not prevent anyone from
obtaining cryptographic software.
     "Much of this is ordinary shrink-wrapped software," Cantwell said,
"the kind millions of people buy every day for their home and business
computers at regular retail outlets.  International consumers who cannot
purchase American computer systems and software programs with encryption
features don't do without, they just buy those products elsewhere.  They
are concerned with protecting their privacy and keeping their businesses
     Cantwell said she is determined to bring the issue out from behind
closed doors and into the light of public debate before the House
Subcommittee on Economic Policy, Trade and Environment marks up the
Export Administration Act early next year.  She said she hopes her bill
will encourage the Administration to act quickly to revise export
controls on software -- perhaps before Congress reconvenes in late
     "The Administration is reviewing this issue, and I think they are
interested in making the changes that will allow American companies to
remain competitive," Cantwell said.  "I would like nothing better than
to come back to Congress after the recess and discover that the problem
had been solved."
                              AMERICAN COMPUTER COMPANIES MUST BE ALLOWED TO
EXPORT SOFTWARE WITH ENCRYPTION CAPABILITIES
_Introduction and Summary_
America's computer software and hardware companies, including such
well-known companies as Apple, DEC, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Lotus,
Microsoft, Novell and Wordperfect, have been among the country's most
internationally competitive firms earning more than one-half of their
revenues from exports.  Unfortunately, this vital American industry is
directly threatened by unilateral U.S. Government export controls which
prevent those companies from meeting worldwide user demand for software
that includes encryption capabilities to protect computer data against
unauthorized disclosure, theft or alteration.  Legislative action is
needed to ensure that American companies do not lose critical
international markets to foreign software companies that operate without
significant export restrictions.
_The Problem_
With ready access to powerful, interconnected, computers, business and
home users increasingly are relying on electronic information storage
and transmissions to conduct their affairs.  At the same time, computer
users worldwide are demanding that computer software offer encryption
capabilities to ensure that their data is secure and its integrity is
Unfortunately, current unilateral U.S. "munitions" export controls
administered by the National Security Agency and the State Department
effectively prohibit the export of American software programs offering
good encryption capabilities.
Yet these unilateral U.S. controls are _not_ effective in restricting
the availability of encryption abroad.  More than 200 generally
available, mass-market foreign commercial programs and products, as well
as many programs available from the Internet, all offer good encryption.
In addition, generally available software with encryption capabilities
is sold within the U.S. at thousands of retail outlets, by mail and over
the phone.  These programs may be transferred abroad in minutes by
anyone using a public telephone line and a computer modem.
The only result of continued U.S. export controls is to threaten the
continued preeminence of America's computer software and hardware
companies in world markets.  American software companies stand to lose
between $6 and $9 billion in annual revenues from sales of generally
available software. In addition, American hardware companies are losing
hundreds of millions of dollars in computer system sales every year,
because sales increasingly are dependent on the ability of a U.S. firm
to offer encryption as a feature of an integrated customer solution
involving hardware, software and services.
_The Solution_
Legislation introduced by U.S. Rep. Maria Cantwell would ensure that
exports of software with encryption capabilities would be controlled by
the Secretary of Commerce as a commercial item and would be exportable.
This legislation is strongly supported by the Business Software Alliance
and the Industry Coalition on Technology Transfer.

New Docs Reveal NSA Role in Telephony Proposal
New Docs Reveal NSA Involvement in Digital Telephony Proposal
  A series of memoranda received by CPSR from the Department of
Commerce last week indicate that the National Security Agency was
actively involved in the 1992 FBI Digital Telephony Proposal. Two weeks
ago, documents received by CPSR indicated that the FBI proposal, code
named "Operation Root Canal," was pushed forward even after reports
from the field found no cases where electronic surveillance was
hampered by new technologies. The documents also revealed that the
Digital Signature Standard was viewed by the FBI as "[t]he first step
in our plan to deal with the encryption issue."
  The earliest memo is dated July 5, 1991, just a few weeks after the
Senate withdrew a Sense of Congress provision from S-266, the Omnibus
Crime Bill of 1991, that encouraged service and equipment providers to
ensure that their equipment would "permit the government to obtain the
plain text contents of voice, data and other communications...." The
documents consist of a series of fax transmittal sheets and memos from
the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Commerce to the
National Security Agency. Many attachments and drafts, including more
detailed descriptions of the  NSA's proposals, were withheld or
released with substantial deletions.
Also included in the documents is a previously released public
statement by the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration entitled "Technological Competitiveness and Policy
Concerns."  The document was requested by Rep. Jack Brooks and states
that the proposal
  could obstruct or distort telecommunications technology development
  by limiting fiber optic transmission, ISDN, digital cellular services
  and other technologies until they are modified, ... could impair the
  security of business communications ... that could facilitate not
  only lawful government interception, but unlawful interception by
  others, [and] could impose industries ability to offer new services
  and technologies.
  CPSR is planning to appeal the Commerce Department's decision to
withhold many of the documents.

     More than three dozen of the nation's leading cryptographers,

President Clinton to abandon the controversial Clipper encryption
proposal.  The letter was coordinated by Computer Professionals

     The group cited the secrecy surrounding the proposal,
widespread public opposition to the plan and privacy concerns as
reasons why the initiative should not go forward.
     The letter comes at a crucial point in the debate on
cryptography policy.  An internal Administration review of the
issue is nearing completion and the National Security Agency (NSA)
is moving forward with efforts to deploy Clipper technology in
civilian agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service.
     CPSR has sponsored several public conferences on

Campaign Against Clipper
CPSR ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN TO OPPOSE CLIPPER PROPOSAL
Embargoed until 2 pm, Monday, February 7, 1994
contact: rotenberg  (202 544 9240)
Washington, DC -- Following the White House decision on Friday to
endorse a secret surveillance standard for the information highway,
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today announced
a national campaign to oppose the government plan.
The Clipper proposal, developed in secret by the National Security
Agency, is a technical standard that will make it easier for government
agents to wiretap the emerging data highway.
Industry groups, professional associations and civil liberties
organizations have expressed almost unanimous opposition to the plan
since it was first proposed in April 1993.
According to Marc Rotenberg, CPSR Washington director, the
Administration made a major blunder with Clipper.  "The public does not
like Clipper and will not accept it. This proposal is fatally flawed."
CPSR cited several problems with the Clipper plan:
o The technical standard is subject to misuse and compromise. It would
provide government agents with copies of the keys that protect
electronic communications.  "It is a nightmare for computer security,"
said CPSR Policy Analyst Dave Banisar.
o The underlying technology was developed in secret by the NSA, an
intelligence agency responsible for electronic eavesdropping, not
privacy protection. Congressional investigations in the 1970s disclosed
widespread NSA abuses, including the illegal interception of millions of
cables sent by American citizens.
o Computer security experts question the integrity of the technology.
Clipper was developed in secret and its specifications are classified.
CPSR has sued the government seeking public disclosure of the Clipper
o NSA overstepped its legal authority in developing the standard.  A
1987 law explicitly limits the intelligence agency's power to set
standards for the nation's communications network.
o There is no evidence to support law enforcement's claims that new
technologies are hampering criminal investigations. CPSR recently forced
the release of FBI documents that show no such problems.
o The Administration ignored the overwhelming opposition of the general
public. When the Commerce Department solicited public comments on the
proposal last fall, hundreds of people opposed the plan while only a few
expressed support.
CPSR today announced four goals for its campaign to oppose the Clipper
o First, to educate the public about the implications of the Clipper
o Second, to encourage people to express their views on the Clipper
proposal, particularly through the computer network.
Toward that goal, CPSR has already begun an electronic petition on the
Internet computer network urging the President to withdraw the Clipper
proposal. In less than one week, the CPSR campaign has drawn thousands
of electronic mail messages expressing concern about Clipper. To sign
on, email clipper.petition with the message "I oppose clipper"
in the body of the text.
o Third, to pursue litigation to force the public disclosure of
documents concerning the Clipper proposal and to test the legality of
the Department of Commerce's decision to endorse the plan.
o Fourth, to examine alternative approaches to Clipper.
Mr. Rotenberg said "We want the public to understand the full
implications of this plan.  Today it is only a few experts and industry
groups that understand the proposal.  But the consequences of Clipper
will touch everyone.  It will affect medical payments, cable television
service, and everything in between.
CPSR is a membership-based public interest organization.  For more

The Clipper Chip: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
What is the Clipper Chip?
private communications while at the same time permitting government agents to obtain the "keys" upon presentation of what has been vaguely characterized as "legal authorization."  The "keys" would be held by two government "escrow agents" and would enable the government to access the encrypted private communication.  While Clipper would be used to encrypt voice transmissions, a similar device known as Capstone would be used to encrypt data.
Who developed the underlying technology?
the National Security Agency (NSA), a super-secret military intelligence agency responsible for intercepting foreign government communications and breaking the codes that protect such transmissions.  In 1987, Congress passed the Computer Security Act, a law intended to limit NSA's role in developing standards for the civilian communications system.  In spite of that legislation, the agency has played a leading role in the Clipper initiative and other civilian security proposals.  NSA has classified the Skipjack algorithm on national security grounds, thus precluding independent evaluation of the system's strength.  CPSR has filed suit under the Freedom of Information Act seeking the disclosure of the secret algorithm and other information concerning the Clipper What is the government's rationale for Clipper?
other law enforcement agencies, which claim that the increasing availability of strong encryption programs will interfere with their ability to conduct wiretapping.  No evidence in support of these claims has been released -- in fact, FBI documents obtained through litigation by CPSR indicate that no such difficulties have been reported by FBI field offices or other federal law enforcement agencies.
How important is wiretapping to law enforcement agencies?
techniques available to law enforcement.  In fact, it is not a widely used technique -- in 1992, fewer than 900 wiretap warrants were issued to state and federal law enforcement agencies.  It is to protect the viability of that small number of wiretaps from an unsubstantiated risk that the FBI and NSA have proposed to compromise the security of billions of electronic transactions.
What is the current status of the Clipper plan?
the "Escrowed Encryption Standard," which is the technical specification for the Clipper system.  This action means that Clipper will become the encryption standard within the government -- all cryptographic products for government use must comply with the standard (i.e., contain the key-
escrow mechanism) and all individuals and businesses wishing to transmit secure communications to government agencies will eventually be obliged to use the NSA-developed technology.
Will the Clipper standard become mandatory?
standard outside of the government, but many industry observers question the reality of this claim.  The government exerts enormous pressure in the marketplace, and it is unlikely that alternative means of encryption will remain viable.  Further, the possibility of Clipper becoming mandatory at some time in the future is quite real given the underlying rationale for the system.  If criminals do, indeed, intend to use encryption to evade electronic surveillance, they are unlikely to voluntarily use the Clipper technology.
What can I do to oppose Clipper?
being organized by CPSR.  Stay informed of relevant developments by reading the CPSR Alert and other periodic announcements.  And consider lending your financial support to CPSR's campaign to protect the privacy of electronic communications.

[4]  EPIC to Provide Clipper Analysis
The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) will be providing policy information on the Clipper proposal. EPIC is a joint project of CPSR and the Fund for Constitutional Government, a national civil liberties organization.
EPIC releases will soon be available to CPSR members through the CPSR Announce list.
  -------------------------------------------------------------
[5] CPSR Needs Your Support!
 If you have signed the CPSR petition, and would like to do more to help stop Clipper, please consider sending a cash contribution to CPSR.
What do we do with the money?  Pay staff salaries, telephone bills, rent, printing costs.  The basics.
Why support CPSR?  Because we have a good reputation for our work on privacy and cryptography, and because  our efforts on Clipper are already having an impact.
We know it's a little scurrilous to ask for money on the network.  We don't do this very often.  The good news is that an anonymous donor has agreed to make a matching grant of $10,000 to support CPSR's Clipper campaign.  That means that if you contribute $50 we receive $100. If you contribute $100 we receive $200 and so on.
Please take a moment to write a check and send it to "CPSR, P.O. Box 717, Palo Alto, CA 94302."  Write "Clipper" on the check.
Thanks in advance.  We appreciate your help.

[6] Call for Discussion on CPSR Newsgroups
CPSR has submitted a Request for Discussion (RFD) to create two
new USENET newsgroups: comp.org.cpsr.news and comp.org.cpsr.talk.
Comp.org.cpsr.news will be a reflection of the cpsr-announce mailing list.  It will be moderated and only carry 1-2 messages per week including the CPSR Alert and other official CPSR releases, and announcements of relevant conferences.
Comp.org.cpsr.talk will be an unmoderated discussion group.  Topics
will include privacy, the NII, working in the computer industry, and other areas of interest to CPSR members.
Formal discussion on the newsgroups is taking place in news.groups. If you have any substantive comments, you may post them there or by e-mail to either news-groups or  news.groups.usenet  If you just wish to express support for the new groups, please hold off until the voting begins in about one      -------------------------------------------------------------

[1] CPSR Launches Clipper Campaign
The electronic petition begun by CPSR to oppose Clipper has generated more than 8,500 responses in less than 10 days. The number is increasing at a faster rate than occurred with the successful 1990 campaign to stop Lotus Marketplace.
Details of the petition follow.  If you have already signed on, ask your friends and colleagues to sign.  Call up your parents.  Tell them to get an email account and then to sign the petition.  Check your rolodex.  Call old friends. Send email to former business partners, lovers, etc.
In your very next email message, ask the person you are writing to if he or she has signed the CPSR Clipper petition.
The number of people who have opposed Clipper already far exceeds the number of lawful wiretaps conducted by all government officials last Other upcoming milestones:
   10,000  Current government orders for Clipper chip (est.)
   12,000  Number of computer networks connected to the Internet
   15,000  Estimated number of total lawful wiretaps, 1968-1994
   70,000  Anticipated number of Clipper purchases this year
More details on the petition follow.

[2] Sign the Clipper Petition!
                Electronic Petition to Oppose Clipper                        *Please Distribute Widely*
On January 24, many of the nation's leading experts in cryptography and computer security wrote President Clinton and asked him to withdraw the Clipper proposal.
The public response to the letter has been extremely favorable, including coverage in the New York Times and numerous computer and security trade magazines.
Many people have expressed interest in adding their names to the letter.  In  response to these requests, CPSR is organizing an Internet petition drive to oppose the Clipper proposal.  We will deliver the signed petition to the White House, complete with the names of all the people who oppose Clipper.
To sign on to the letter, send a message to:
     Clipper.petition
with the message "I oppose Clipper" (no quotes)
You will receive a return message confirming your vote.
Please distribute this announcement so that others may also express their opposition to the Clipper proposal.
The President The White House Washington, DC  20500
Dear Mr. President:
     "We are writing to you regarding the "Clipper" escrowed encryption proposal now under consideration by the White House.  We wish to express our concern about this plan and similar technical standards that may be proposed for the nation's communications infrastructure.
     "The current proposal was developed in secret by federal agencies primarily concerned about electronic surveillance, not privacy protection.  Critical aspects of the plan remain classified and thus beyond public review.
     "The private sector and the public have expressed nearly unanimous opposition to Clipper.  In the formal request for comments conducted by the Department of Commerce last year, less than a handful of respondents supported the plan.  Several hundred opposed it.
     "If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that hope to develop new products will face extensive government obstacles. Cryptographers who wish to develop new privacy enhancing technologies will be discouraged.  Citizens who anticipate that the progress of technology will enhance personal privacy will find their expectations unfulfilled.
     "Some have proposed that Clipper be adopted on a voluntary basis and suggest that other technical approaches will remain viable.  The government, however, exerts enormous influence in the marketplace, and the likelihood that competing standards would survive is small.  Few in the user community believe that the proposal would be truly voluntary.
     "The Clipper proposal should not be adopted.  We believe that if
this proposal and the associated standards go forward, even on a voluntary basis, privacy protection will be diminished, innovation will be slowed, government accountability will be lessened, and the openness necessary to ensure the successful development of the nation's communications infrastructure will be threatened.
     "We respectfully ask the White House to withdraw the Clipper

[3] Clipper FAQ
The Clipper Chip: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
What is the Clipper Chip?
private communications while at the same time permitting government agents to obtain the "keys" upon presentation of what has been vaguely characterized as "legal authorization."  The "keys" would be held by two government "escrow agents" and would enable the government to access the encrypted private communication.  While Clipper would be used to encrypt voice transmissions, a similar device known as Capstone would be used to encrypt data.
Who developed the underlying technology?
the National Security Agency (NSA), a super-secret military intelligence agency responsible for intercepting foreign government communications and breaking the codes that protect such transmissions.  In 1987, Congress passed the Computer Security Act, a law intended to limit NSA's role in developing standards for the civilian communications system.  In spite of that legislation, the agency has played a leading role in the Clipper initiative and other civilian security proposals.  NSA has classified the Skipjack algorithm on national security grounds, thus precluding independent evaluation of the system's strength.  CPSR has filed suit under the Freedom of Information Act seeking the disclosure of the secret algorithm and other information concerning the Clipper What is the government's rationale for Clipper?
other law enforcement agencies, which claim that the increasing availability of strong encryption programs will interfere with their ability to conduct wiretapping.  No evidence in support of these claims has been released -- in fact, FBI documents obtained through litigation by CPSR indicate that no such difficulties have been reported by FBI field offices or other federal law enforcement agencies.
How important is wiretapping to law enforcement agencies?
techniques available to law enforcement.  In fact, it is not a widely used technique -- in 1992, fewer than 900 wiretap warrants were issued to state and federal law enforcement agencies.  It is to protect the viability of that small number of wiretaps from an unsubstantiated risk that the FBI and NSA have proposed to compromise the security of billions of electronic transactions.
What is the current status of the Clipper plan?
the "Escrowed Encryption Standard," which is the technical specification for the Clipper system.  This action means that Clipper will become the encryption standard within the government -- all cryptographic products for government use must comply with the standard (i.e., contain the key-
escrow mechanism) and all individuals and businesses wishing to transmit secure communications to government agencies will eventually be obliged to use the NSA-developed technology.
Will the Clipper standard become mandatory?
standard outside of the government, but many industry observers question the reality of this claim.  The government exerts enormous pressure in the marketplace, and it is unlikely that alternative means of encryption will remain viable.  Further, the possibility of Clipper becoming mandatory at some time in the future is quite real given the underlying rationale for the system.

[1] Clipper Petition Tops 10,000 Mark
The electronic petition begun by CPSR to oppose Clipper has generated
well over 10,000 responses in two weeks.  The daily signature totals
continue to increase, currently running at almost 2,000 per day!
The number of people who have opposed Clipper already exceeds the
current estimated government orders for Clipper chips.
Other upcoming milestones:
   12,000  Number of computer networks connected to the Internet
   15,000  Estimated number of total lawful wiretaps, 1968-1994
   70,000  Anticipated number of Clipper purchases this year

[2] Safire Slams Clipper
For those of you who might have missed it, William Safire published a
very good essay on the Clipper proposal yesterday (February 14). We're
providing some excerpts here and recommend the piece in its entirety.
Let's hope Safire can do for Clipper what he did for Bobby Inman.
  Well-meaning law and intelligence officials, vainly seeking to   maintain their vanishing ability to eavesdrop, have come up with   a scheme that endangers the personal freedom of every American.
            *     *     *
  The "clipper chip" --- aptly named, as it clips the wings of
  individual liberty --- would encode, for Federal perusal whenever a   judge rubber-stamped a warrant, everything we say on a phone,   everything we write on a computer, every order we give to a shopping
  network or bank or 800 or 900 number, every electronic note we leave
  our spouses or dictate to our personal-digit-assistant genies.
  Add to that stack of intimate data the medical information derived
  from the national "health security card" Mr. Clinton proposes we all   carry. Combine it with the travel, shopping and credit data available   from all our plastic cards, along with psychological and student test   scores. Throw in the confidential tax returns, sealed divorce   proceedings, welfare records, field investigations for job   applications, raw files and C.I.A. dossiers available to the Feds, and   you have the individual citizen standing naked to the nosy bureaucrat.
            *     *     *
  The only people tap-able by American agents would be honest Americans
  --- or those crooked Americans dopey enough to buy American equipment   with the pre-compromised American code.  Subsequent laws to mandate the   F.B.I. bug in every transmitter would be as effective as today's laws   banning radar detectors.
            *     *     *
  Cash in your clipper chips, wiretappers:  you can't detect the crime
  wave of the future with those old earphones on.

[3] A Tough Question
During the briefing on February 4 at which the formal adoption of the
Escrowed Encryption Standard (aka Clipper) was announced, Mark Richards,
Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division,   was asked
the following hypothetical question:
  Suppose NSA goes to the key escrow agents and says, "We intercepted
  a Clipper-encrypted communication overseas.  No U.S. persons
  were parties, so the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act does
  not apply and we don't need a warrant."  How do the escrow
  agents determine whether or not to provide the keys?  Doesn't
  this create a huge loophole in the system?
Richards' response was that there would be "some" mechanism developed to
ensure that there would be no abuse of the key escrow system, but added
that any such procedures "might not be made public."  The response was
less than assuring.  The development of secret procedures for foreign
intelligence use of escrowed keys does nothing to assure the public of
the system's integrity.  It creates a very real possibility that the key
escrow system will be based upon nothing more than NSA's unilateral
representations concerning the circumstances of a particular
It was not at all apparent why these procedures couldn't be made public.
Like so much of the Clipper proposal, valid concerns are met with the
claim that "national security" precludes the disclosure of relevant
information.  This is why many of us believe this is a dangerous and
ill-advised way to design our civilian communications infrastructure.
     ---------------------------------------------------------------
[4] Clipper Facts: Definition of "Tesserea"
The Defense Department reportedly plans to employ the Clipper technology
in a device known as a "Tessera Card."  We checked the dictionary and
found the results to be kind of frightening:
  Terrerea n. Lat. (pl. tessereae).  Literally, "four-cornered".  Used
  to refer to four-legged tables, chairs, stools, etc.  Also, a single
  piece of mosaic tile; a single piece of a mosaic.  _Pol._: An identity
  chit or marker.  Tessereae were forced on conquered peoples and   domestic slaves by their Roman occupiers or owners.  Slaves or Gauls   who refused to accept a tesserea were branded or maimed as a form of   identification.

                                             Page 16  Super-spooks seek to extend domain to data networks; US agency wants
ability to spy on new superhighways. by  Leonard Doyle
    In Roman times conquered peoples and slaves were forced to carry
tesserae or
identity chits and any Gaul or slave who refused to accept one was branded
maimed instead. Soon all users of computer networks may be singled out for
tessera treatment if the National Security Agency, America's super secret
military intelligence agency, has its way.
    The NSA, with a budget of $ 30bn ( pounds 20.5bn) a year, is responsible
intercepting foreign government communications and breaking the codes that
protect such transmissions. America's most exclusive spooks are worried that
advances in encryption technology are about to rob them of their ability to
conduct surveillance on a global scale.
    After nearly 50 years of electronic eavesdropping, the NSA is finding
some widely available codes are impossible to crack. The worry is that
governments, drug barons, terrorists and money launderers will have a field
using networks or information highways built and maintained by the US or,
that matter, the European Union.
    But here is the rub. Anyone who wants to use government-funded
highways in future may be forced to use the lacklustre encryption technology
provided by the intelligence agencies, complete with a backdoor access for
official eavesdropping.
    Simon Davies, of Privacy International, a consultancy, has no doubt this
will happen. ''A Wild West frontier - self-regulated by ethics and culture -
evolved in the computer communications business and now that the stakes are
getting higher, government is trying to muscle in.''
    It is widely predicted that by the end of the century about 50 per cent
world trade will be in services and that much of this will be carried out
computer- linked databases communicating across continents at the speed of
light. It is this lucrative trade which the NSA intends to protect and
The Internet system has already been identified by the Clinton
Administration as
the basis of a new information superhighway. If that should happen,
organisations such as Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility and
Electronic Freedom Foundation fear that future access to the networks could
restricted to users of an encryption product developed by the NSA - which
ironically enough is called Tessera.
    The fear is that the freewheeling, anonymous access that hundreds of
thousands of individual network users enjoy at the electronic frontier may
To the outrage of users in the US and elsewhere, the Administration recently
backed the NSA's plans to ensure that the agency will always be able to
intercept and decode messages sent over computer and telephone lines. The
privacy concerns are by no means confined to US computer users. Anyone who
every logged onto a bulletin board or computer service like Compuserve or
Internet could be affected.
    The Administration has played up the law and order side of the debate,
arguing that advanced encryption will be used by criminals and terrorists.
Gore, the Vice- president, announcing the new policy at the beginning of
February, said: ''Our policy is designed to provide better encryption to
individuals and businesses, while ensuring that the needs of law enforcement
national security are met.''
    However many leading experts in cryptography, computer security and
in the US do not agree and said so in a letter to President Clinton last
asking him to withdraw the NSA's proposal. That appeal failed to avert the
decision to back the Tessera and since then a petition organised by Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility has been signed by more than 1
people who have sent their complaints by electronic mail to the President.
    There is no parallel debate taking place in the European Union, but the
intelligence agencies here are just as busy trying to ensure that the
information highways of the future can be monitored. Jacques Delors,
of the EU Commission, sees data highways as being key to future
and job creation. Before long individuals will be able to hook up to the
for all sorts of transactions, from renting a movie to view at home to
swiping a
smartcard through a reader at the doctor's surgery to bring up an entire
    The real business will of course be conducted by service companies, from
banks to insurers to market traders. For these companies privacy and
are of growing concern, to which the NSA has responded with its relatively
encryption devices. But Tessera, which fits into the back of a computer,
also identify the user and has a special built-in ''trapdoor'' that will
the NSA to eavesdrop on E-mail and other messages.
    Another cryptographic device known as the  Clipper Chip  can be used to
scramble telephone and fax communications while giving the security services
same ability to eavesdrop with the help of a special electronic key, held in
''escrow'' by the government agencies. Government agents will be able to
the ''keys'' upon presentation of what has been vaguely as ''legal
    These ''keys'' will be held by two ''escrow agents'' and would enable
government to access the private voice transmissions. A similar device known
Capstone would be used for data sent via computer modem. The Administration
hopes its encryption devices will at some stage have to be universally used
US industry.
    However, the outpouring of vehement objections from the computer
telephone companies and privacy groups in the US may have shaken the
Administration and some computer professionals say that the NSA's encryption
technology has no chance of being accepted in the market place.
    Sharron Webb of the National Computer Security Organisation is one of
leading the fight against the spy agency's encroachment into the world of
computer communications. ''If the US government has a hand in setting up the
information superhighways here, they may require users to use Tessera to
participate, it is then only a matter of time before foreign users are
on board as well.''
    Already the signs are that big business will knuckle under in the face
fierce pressure from the US Administration. The largest American telephone
company, AT&T, has agreed to buy the NSA's technology and to include it in
scrambling devices which sell for about $ 1,000 ( pounds 680) each. Other
companies are expected to follow suit, especially if they wish to maintain
lucrative contracts with the federal government.
    What remains unclear is how the EU and individual European governments
intend to react to the US moves. So far the US is looking only to American
companies and their overseas subsidiaries to use the new encryption
But sooner or later decisions will have to be made that affect European
The smart money is on the EU adopting the Tessara philosophy, but with
electronic keys for each country's eavesdropping agencies.

[2] FBI Digital Telephony Bill Returns
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reintroduced its controversial
1992 proposal to require that communications service providers redesign
their equipment to facilitate electronic surveillance.  The Bureau has
sent a draft to Congress but so far, no Senator or Congressperson has
stepped forward to sponsor it.
The draft bill, ironically named the Digital Telephony and
Communications Privacy Improvement Act of 1994, mandates that common
carriers (phone, cable and computer network companies) modify their
switches and computers to ensure that surveillance can be conducted
concurrently from a remote government facility.  It requires that
manufacturers and support companies assist carriers.
In an addition to the 1992 bill, the 1994 bill also mandates that
systems be designed to collect transactional information that users
generate and make that information available to law enforcement
agencies.  This information includes data on calls made and received.
Under the NII, future information collected may include all manner of
transactions, including purchases, financial and medical information.
Any company that fails to comply with the requirements of the bill
would be fined $10,000/day and shut down.  Companies would have three
years from the date of enactment to comply.  The Attorney General would
have the authority to enact these penalties and would be encouraged to
cooperate with the Federal Communication Commission.  The FCC would
issue rules to cover the cost of complying with the procedures. An
internal FBI memo released to CPSR under a Freedom of Information Act
lawsuit estimates the cost of compliance at $300 million.
Communications Daily reports that other experts have estimated that the
cost will be over one billion dollars.
The bill also revises sections of the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act to extend the legal protection of ECPA to cordless phones and
clarifies ECPA to allow for monitoring of computer systems by system
The 1992 bill was never formally introduced due to lack of a sponsor
after industry, civil liberties groups and the public criticized it.
Copies of the 1994 and 1992 drafts are available from the CPSR Internet
Library. (see below for details).

proposal. To obtain a video copy of the ABC Nightline special on the

[4] The Cantwell Bill and Clipper
We've received several inquiries concerning H.R. 3627, Rep. Maria
Cantwell's bill to liberalize export controls on encryption software.
Some people have been given the impression that the Cantwell bill is a
response to the Administration's Clipper initiative and that passage of
the legislation would effectively put the Clipper issue to rest.
Because of the confusion surrounding this proposed legislation, we
think it's important to provide some clarifying information.
Rep. Cantwell introduced H.R. 3627 on November 22, 1993. Her comments
on the purpose of the legislation appeared in the Congressional Record
on November 24, 1993, at Volume 139, Page 3110. According to Rep.
    The legislation I am introducing today is needed to ensure
    that American companies do not lose critical international
    markets to foreign competitors that operate without significant
    export restrictions. Without this legislation, American software
    companies, some of America's star economic performers, have
    estimated they stand to lose between $6 and $9 billion in revenue
    each year. American hardware companies are already losing
    hundreds of millions of dollars in lost computer system sales
    because increasingly sales are dependent on the ability of a U.S.
    firm to offer encryption as a feature of an integrated customer
    solution involving hardware, software, and services.
            *          *          *
    This legislation takes some important steps to resolve a
    serious problem facing some of our most dynamic industries. It
    would give the Secretary of Commerce exclusive authority over
    dual use information security programs and products, eliminates
    the requirement for export licenses for generally available
    software with encryption capabilities, and requires the Secretary
    to grant such validated licenses for exports of other software
    with encryption capabilities to any country to which we already
    approve exports for foreign financial institutions.
            *          *          *
    My legislation is straightforward. It would allow American
    companies to sell the commercial software they develop in the
    United States to their overseas customers including our European
    allies -- something that is very difficult if not impossible
    under present policies.
Rep. Cantwell's remarks contained no reference to the
Administration's Clipper initiative, which had first been announced
some seven months earlier.
Indeed, there is no provision in H.R. 3627 that would in any way
rescind the Administration's recent decision to adopt key-escrow
Clipper technology as the government encryption standard. The
legislation would do precisely what Rep. Cantwell said it would do --
relax restrictions on the export of strong encryption products outside
of the United States.
Some have suggested that passage of the Cantwell bill would create an
environment in which it is less likely that Clipper will become the de
facto encryption standard within the United States. This view was
expressed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and several large
corporations in a letter to the President last December which expressed
"tentative" support for Clipper on a "voluntary" basis. CPSR dissented
from this position in a subsequent letter to the President and

While it is possible that the Cantwell legislation would make it less
likely that Clipper will become the de facto privacy standard, such a
result is by no means a certainty. It is, in fact, possible that
passage of the legislation would provide better U.S. encryption
products overseas than would be available within the United States --
particularly if, as many fear, Clipper eventually becomes a mandatory
standard in this country.
We believe that the Cantwell bill is a step in the right direction, as
it would remove current disincentives to the development of strong
encryption products by U.S. companies. But the proposed legislation is
not a panacea -- it would not address the threat to privacy in the
United States created by the Clipper initiative. Export controls on
cryptography are a related issue, but they are not central to the
Clipper controversy. The Administration's adoption of the key-escrow
Clipper standard must be opposed and reversed.

March 15, 1994
Honorable Reed Hundt
Chairman, Federal Communications Commission
1919 M Street, Room 814
Washington, D.C.  20554
Dear Chairman Hundt:
We are writing to ask that you use the Internet to broaden
opportunities for democratic participation in FCC proceedings. We applaud the FCC for its recent announcement that it has
established FCC.GOV as an Internet node, and that the FCC Daily
Digest is now available for free by ftp from FCC.GOV.  We were
also pleased that you have asked the FCC staff to examine methods
and procedures for accepting comments on FCC dockets
The measures discussed below would build on your efforts, and are
intended to make it easier and less costly for citizens to follow
the FCC's work.
1.   The FCC should provide Internet electronic mail discussion
     "lists" on all FCC rulemakings and inquiries.  Citizens
     should be able to sign up for a proceeding by sending a
     message to the FCC.GOV listserve, with a simple message such
     as "subscribe pcs-auction-rules-93-253."
     These Internet discussion lists use today's technology to
     empower citizens, by enhancing their ability to follow
     important policy debates.  In an Internet discussion list, a
     citizen can send a message to the FCC listserve, and that
     message will be echoed to every subscriber on the list.  The
     persons receiving the message will have an opportunity to
     respond, and a real dialogue can take place.  As discussions
     and debates on the Internet email lists unfold, citizens
     will have opportunities to gain a much deeper understanding
     of the issues raised in the proceedings, and how they will
     be affected by the FCC's actions.
2.   In considering methods for accepting comments from the
     public in FCC dockets, the Commission should provide
     citizens the opportunity to file comments via electronic
     mail which is gatewayed through the Internet.  These
     comments should be separate from the dialogue on the
     discussion lists, and reflect the commentors final views on
     the subject matter.  Several federal agencies now provide
     opportunities to file comments by electronic mail.  For
     example, OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
     (OIRA), began accepting comments on its Circular A-130 by
     electronic mail in 1992.
3.   As you have already indicated, it will be important that the
     FCC take steps to ensure that the use of electronic
     communications is consistent with the legal requirements
     that the public record be complete and accessible.  We
     understand that the Commission will have to devise ways of
     ensuring that this broadened public dialogue becomes part of
     the public record and is in compliance with the
     Administrative Procedures Act.  The Commission should make
     these comments available to the public both online and
     through the FCC's reading room.
4.   Many citizens can access the Internet via electronic mail,
     but do not have access to ftp or gopher technologies.  Thus,
     it would be very helpful if the FCC.GOV would provide an
     "email ftp" service for obtaining files from FCC.GOV, as
     well as an ability to subscribe to the Daily Digest through
     electronic mail.
Of all the vaunted promises of the information superhighway, the
most important is that new information technologies provide
opportunities to enhance democratic processes.  One of the most
important and valuable aspects of the Internet has been its role
in restoring civic discourse on a wide range of issues.  By
adopting these recommendations, the FCC will gain a deeper
understanding of the opportunities for enhanced democratic
discourse, and it will broaden citizen opportunities to
participate in debates over FCC policies.

TECHNOLOGY WHO SHOULD KEEP THE KEYS?
The U.S. government wants the power to tap into every phone, fax and computer BY PHILIP ELMER-DEWITT
  Until quite recently, cryptography -- the science of making and breaking secret codes -- was, well, secret. In the U.S. the field was dominated by the National Security Agency, a government outfit so clandestine that the U.S. for many years denied its existence. The NSA, which gathers intelligence for national security purposes by eavesdropping on overseas phone calls and cables, did everything in its power to make sure nobody had a code that it couldn't break. It kept tight reins on the ''keys'' used to translate coded text into plain text, prohibiting the export of secret codes under U.S. munitions laws and ensuring that the encryption scheme used by business -- the so-called Digital Encryption Standard -- was weak enough that NSA supercomputers could cut through it like butter.
  But the past few years have not been kind to the NSA. Not only has its cover been blown, but so has its monopoly on encryption technology. As computers -- the engines of modern cryptography -- have proliferated, so have ever more powerful encryption algorithms. Telephones that offered nearly airtight privacy protection began to appear on the market, and in January U.S. computermakers said they were ready to adopt a new encryption standard so robust that even the NSA couldn't crack it.   Thus the stage was set for one of the most bizarre technology-policy battles ever waged: the Clipper Chip war. Lined up on one side are the three-
letter cloak-and-dagger agencies -- the NSA, the CIA and the FBI -- and key policymakers in the Clinton Administration (who are taking a surprisingly hard line on the encryption issue). Opposing them is an equally unlikely coalition of computer firms, civil libertarians, conservative columnists and a strange breed of cryptoanarchists who call themselves the cypherpunks.   At the center is the Clipper Chip, a semiconductor device that the NSA developed and wants installed in every telephone, computer modem and fax machine. The chip combines a powerful encryption algorithm with a ''back door'' -- the cryptographic equivalent of the master key that opens schoolchildren's padlocks when they forget their combinations. A ''secure'' phone equipped with the chip could, with proper authorization, be cracked by the government. Law-enforcement agencies say they need this capability to keep tabs on drug runners, terrorists and spies. Critics denounce the Clipper

Actually that was a series of CPSR FOIA requests dating back to 1992. EFF (except for some done by Bd. Member John Gilmore) does not do FOIA.
There are fudging seriously on the 91 figure. They admit that none of them have to do with digital telephony. At least 10 were from NY in the mid-80s when everyone wanted a cell phone and there wernt enough ports for the FBI to wiretaps them all at the same time. That situation has been remedied. Another 30 of them were when they could not slap a pen register on a cell phone (actually nothing to do with taps at all really). and so on. After Freeh mentioned the 9 figure, Leahy really took him apart on the figures.

@_subject: Another Anti-Clipper Resolution 
I found this on the Public_Keys forum on Fidonet..
The following was passed as a resolution for the Republican convention in Senatorial District 19 of Uvalde county, Texas. I will attempt to get it adopted at the state level also.
ENCRYPTION/GOVERNMENT MONITORING (BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU)
Whereas, government is increasingly intruding into the private matters
of its citizens,
And, an example of this intrusion is Clinton's Clipper/Skipjack
encryption chip, which would allow the government easy access to all
private and corporate electronic communications by telephone, computer,
And, a further example is the government's push to force all
communications providers to leave a "back door" through which the
government could easily monitor all communications,
And, it is a trait only of despotic governments to scrutinize the
private communications of its citizens,
Resolved, we urge that the Clipper/Skipjack scheme be dropped and the
Digital Telephony Act killed, that private communications and encryption
be allowed to flourish without government "back doors," and we urge our
government to give up the idea that we the people are guilty of
something and must be monitored.
