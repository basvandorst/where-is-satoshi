Word-List Builder  (this is not an ad)
I have a small(5k) program(WordList.EXE) that will extract  from any
file and append the new words to a textfile(MainList.TXT).  It is in early
beta, but does the job nicely.  I simply drag-n-drop multiple files onto the
icon and let it do its dirty work.  It prints new words to the screen and
echos "." when it encounters old words again.  It will, of course, accept
parameters from DOS.
This is totally free to anyone who wants it.  Just email and I will send the
latest version.  Suggestions are certainly considered.
Imagine building a word-list just from your /Netscape/Cache subdirectory!
Future versions will include:
     Larger multiple file handling, *.* in same directory support, better
binary file support, and list sorting.

Sure, I'm not a Unix guru, but if you can port Turbo Pascal, more power to you!
I will send the source if someone specifically asks.
Unix, you can do, but the recursive subdirs aren't a prob for me.  A final dream
would be to convert it to VB4, use MS's WWW custom control, and unleash it as a

Ok fellas, I am usually against senseless arguing.  Especially over a
subject that certain individuals shouldn't even had wasted the time to reply
to if they couldn't give a sh*t about it in the first place.  Therefore, I
assume that they are arguing JUST to argue, but they wait until a topic pops
up that they have some background in, therefore standing a chance of
winning.  Well, you already lost when you assumed that something worthwhile
or useful would come of your negative responses.  Oh, excuse me; you did get
replies to your responses, so I guess your investment did turn a profit.
Well, stooping even further into your realm, I too visited my trusty search
utility, MetaCrawler.  It too found all four of your words.  I decided to
pluck five odd-looking words from my MAINLIST.TXT produced by Word-List
Builder.  The list is COMPLETELY untouched or altered by human hands.  I ran
all five of them through MetaCrawler and your DejaNews (ultra list source)
and here are the results:
Word                 MetaCrawler DejaNews
-------------------- ----------- --------
DisplayWorkstationSe 0           0
SETUPPP              0           0
TmpDirPad            0           0
dsRegSetPads         0           0
TotalSwapReqdFromINF 0           0
(These words were all found in the first 1% of my list and then I got bored.)
Logic tells me that a word that can be found ANYWHERE with a
publicly-available search utility would not be the IDEAL passphrase to lock
up my secrets.
Well, now that I know where YOU will be assembling your list from, I can
rest assured to pull one from my list instead.

My apologies if you thought that I was pinpointing you, Mark, as an
individual.  You actually did a good job of proving to Ben that his example
words were useless in his argument.  One should gather actual data before
making statements.  God knows everyone else will evaluate data ten-times
more than the poster will.  I was merely trying to state that negative
comments (that have no direction or obvious support of the conversation) are
not in the interest of the entire group.  At most, they should be considered
private and voiced via email.

Is there a free/trial/steal/shareware version of Viacrypt PGP Personal
version 4.0, rather than forking over $129.00?
