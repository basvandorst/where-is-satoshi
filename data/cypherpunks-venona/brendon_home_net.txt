@_subject: proxy servers in Singapore 
Did anyone else catch the AP wire story
(it ran here in the SF Chronicle on Thursday)
about the Singapore government cracking
down on "undesirable" (e.g., sex smut, anti-govt.
postings etc.) content on web sites, usenet etc.
Their basically forcing, by law, Singapore  ISPs to use
proxy servers that contain the information
that the govt. deems fit. Scary if you ask me. But then they have a govt.
that acts like it's the management of Disneyland.
"Have a nice ride!"
