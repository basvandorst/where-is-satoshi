Hm, aren't European remailers something "like" Fortress remailers? The State surely doesn't require consent for anon.penet.fi or such and no one in the US(well I hope no one) knows the physical location of it... And you can post just about anything through that one :)....

@_subject: cancelling a message 
Hello to all Cypherpunk subscribers.
Someone in here recently mentioned cancelling a post on USENET. It's been put to my knowledge that this is possible, but I have never known what it actually means and how it is done. Whose messages can I cancel(anyone's on the whole worldwide I-net or?) and how do I cancel them? If it helps any, I use the Tin Pl12 newsreader. Any replies are welcome. Please fill me in on this one. Thank you.
p.s. Hey Amanda(Walker)! :-) I didn't know you were on this list too. L8r.
