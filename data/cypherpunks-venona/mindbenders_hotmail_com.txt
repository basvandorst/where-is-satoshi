This may not have to do with you guys..but I have a question...why do Telco
people and the government blame us hackers for costing them billions of dollars
a year to fix the security holes that they have???  Instead of charging us with
felony's and with money they should thank us and/or hire us to find thier holes
and fix them!!  I don't like to screw Ma Bell..but she does have to lighten up.
