My response to Dr. Frederick B. Cohen:
I rarely write ANYTHING to the list unless I think it's absolutly
necessary and has a semblence of Crypto (keeps the SNR down).
I'm looking forward to doing something similar to the crack RC4
thing again.
Anyway, after reading the crap below I have been forced to comment.
For an individual that parades the title of Doctor (and the indication of intelligence that title should imply) you seem to lack the grasp of what
has been stated over and over again. If you can't study the source code,
find somone that you trust that can! Prove it *doesn't* work before you
knock it.  Lastly, this interpretation of a threat from being added to a killfile
was the last straw.
Tell the FBI I sent the following Dr.Cohen :   PLONK!
I never play nice.

You tell'em Christopher! I have turned on quite a few of my friends to Linux. Some are Engineers and Programmers in businesses that would love to add
Netscape navigator and server. Hell, I would too.
Screw 'em. If they want to be the defacto standard for *some* OS's but
not all, someone else will come along and fill in the gap.
Besides, they already made the point that they don't want to make money
so why change the status quo. All the more reason to show the weaknesses
of the product before others get sucked in.
I'll stick to TkWWW and Lynx thank you.

Well to stray off topic,as seems to be the case lately,
I saw Sameer's interview on C-Net a coupla weeks back. Nice to be able to place a name with a face. Too bad they didn't give you a chance to say more
for the cause.
Now.....back to crypto....

Maybe the Jargon File offers some insight:
:Mbogo, Dr. Fred: /*m-boh'goh, dok'tr fred/ [Stanford] n. The
   archetypal man you don't want to see about a problem, esp. an
   incompetent professional; a shyster.  "Do you know a good eye
   doctor?"  "Sure, try Mbogo Eye Care and Professional Dry
   Cleaning."  The name comes from synergy between {bogus} and the
   original Dr. Mbogo, a witch doctor who was Gomez Addams' physician
   on the old "Addams Family" TV show.  Compare {Bloggs Family,
   the}, see also {fred}.
It all starts to make sense now.....

Look, I aint no crypto expert or nuthin', but I have spent a lot of time
looking for the algorithm or key to figure this thing out and I can't
find it. I got whole ROOMS of cpu's crankin' on this one, I even called
uncle Al at Fort Meade and he called back and said, "....dunno...must be some newfangled stego or something, I'll call you back".
Was this really a newsletter post or do I need to go back to codebreaker
