Trivial.  Just have pgp look at the file without giving it any commands.
I.e. instead of
Pgp will examine the file, tell you it contains keys, show them to
you and then ask if you want to add them to your keyring.  This is
the way I normally add keys, just because I like to look at *any* file
before I add it to any system.

Now, now.  I don't think RSADSI had any illusions of 40-bit keys being
secure; they just wanted to find out just *how* insecure they were.
I suspect that this crack will *benefit* RSADSI, and the rest of the
crypto community, by helping to convince the feds to ease up.
