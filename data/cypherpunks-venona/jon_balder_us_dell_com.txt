People interested in fingerprinting anonymous posters might be interested in a
Markov tuple analysis program that was posted to the net eons ago.  It should
be in the '85 or '86 comp.sources under the name markov3.  I recall that this
was a program that fed enough posts from a given poster would create another
post in their "style"; it was kinda fun.

@_subject: Modem taps/Caller ID 
I don't know if this is particularly true but you can purchase modems
that recognize caller-id and distinctive ring data.  The caller-id
information is printed between the RING and CONNECT strings.  In
particular, I have re-written the UNIX getty program in order to take
these strings and put them in an environment variable before calling
login.  Since the getty actually uses ATA to answer the phone rather
than setting S0=1, we have considered building a database of known
troublemakers' phone numbers and then have getty let the phone ring
away to NO CARRIER when said tarbs call.  ZyXEL makes such a modem.

@_subject: PC random number hardware 
Does anyone know of a commerical source (or schematics) for a good random
bitstream generator -- something that you hang off of COM1 and read random
bytes from?
Can anyone refute the claim that you can only generate truly random numbers
using hardware?  I recall seeing a proof that totally random numbers could
only be generated by an infinitely large program.

I thought we already had a data superhighway and what congress (et Al) is
really talking about is a national system of on-ramps and off-ramps?

@_subject: mix 
Does anybody have source code to Istvan Mohos "mix" programs?  I have the
binaries but I lost the source a while back.  It's kind-of a fun encryption
algorithm because it's a transposition cypher rather than a stream cypher --
the result set contains exactly the same characters as the input set.

@_subject: Re: dialup Mosaic!!!!?? 
You can already run the Mac client over a MacSLIP connection.  Tho', even with
something like a 56Kb/s connection it's excruciatingly painfully slow.
The "problem" with Mosaic is that it makes you realize that Internet multi-
media hypertext applications require at least a T1 (1,544,000 bps) connection
to begin to be liveable.
I continue to be amazed at the fact that no matter how fast you go or how
much memory you buy it still only takes about eighteen months to go from the
leading edge to the lame edge.  I now find it hard to imagine that I would
ever make the statement "a 50Mb/s connection just isn't fast enough" -- I
well remember when I thought that a T1 was more then you could ever use, but
Mosaic just burns it up.  more! more! more! :-)

Exabyte is coming out with a 25gb 8mm drive, so storing all that traffic for a
year will cost you about $8.95. :-)

@_subject: Re: Credit cards vs. digital cash 
I run a national network of public-access email systems.  We do not validate
anything about our callers and when they run a credit card charge, all we ask
for is the name on the card -- we don't check that against anything.  We have
50% more subscribers than the Well and we're making buckets of money.  Even
though our callers are anonymous we still see a chargeback rate of less than
0.5%, which we consider to be an acceptable cost of doing business.
It's my opinion that we have four things working in our favor:
1.  Most people are honest.  When you start analyzing the different ways that
    people can screw you, you can quickly forget this point.
2.  People buy their time in advance.  We "see" these people on a regular
    basis so we can partially "recover" by shutting off an account operating
    on fraud-based monies.
3.  We limit people to buying only what they need for the short term and do
    not give them the opportunity to charge up a card.
4.  We have a long memory for bad card numbers and shady customers. :-)
I say these things because I've noticed that there is a general assumption
that anyone doing commerce in a more anonymous environment like cyberspace
is going to be Under Siege at All Times by People in Black Hats.  That's an
appropriate attitude to take in order to set the context for the discussion
of ways to prevent fraud, etc.  But! don't be surprised that when you
present the results of your efforts to people who are looking to do business
on the net, that they will tell you that your solutions are too complicated
and too paranoid for their situation.  Most people will be too busy running
their business and counting their money to really care about that 0.5%
