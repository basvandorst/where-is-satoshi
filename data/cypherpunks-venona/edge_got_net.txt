Use the right tool for the right job. Cycle sales are useless for most
applications, and forcing a square peg into a round peg will only result in
frustration. There are a gazillion useful outlets for this technology,
though - more pop up all the time. The latest I heard today was OCR .tiff ->
.txt conversion, where the payee can afford (cpu-wise) to toggle all the

Voting - send the same data to 3+ unrelated machines (if you can afford

Sanity checking - depends on the algorithms in question; may require human

We had discussed this at the last Bay Area Cypherpunks meeting (BTW,
when/where is the next??), and came to the conclusion that it would be
technologically simple, but load inefficient, to implement in a large scale
at this point.
The main problem with anonymous http (or telnet, talk, etc) lies in the
sheer amount of information being transferred, and the even larger amount of
noise an anonymous site would have to generate to defeat traffic analysis. A
mail message is usually under a few K, but with these larger systems you
move into the multiple meg realms; to hide a single individual's (ie,)
3K/sec stream, a provider would have to generate many times that in cover
traffic. We can force traffic to the user from network speeds to slow down
to modem speeds, but that doesn't help the inbound crunch at all. Web sites
don't generally generate much inbound traffic, but when coupled with dialups
(such as in my case) this could lead to bad service to the local modem users.
The good news is, with multiple anon redirectors bouncing traffic between
them to further confuse an attacker, the number of users can grow an order
of magnitude without any additional load, since the streams are hiding in
the midst of other streams and far less random cover traffic needs to be
Software-wise, an anonymous http scheme could be implemented with a standard
proxy server with remote host access restrictions and log analysis tools to
charge the appropriate individuals for their usage (a la anon email postage
stamp rolls). Down the road, cover traffic, ecash payment, encryption, and
other nifty toys can be added.
If anyone on this list is in need of anonymous http right now (even to
tinker with it) I'd be willing to set up a free-use proxy, as long as you
don't bring our server or our pipe to their knees. Mail me (privately if you
wish) with the individual IPs/names of the hosts you'd be coming in from -
no blanket domain names, please, unless they're your own personal network.
If I see enough interest I'll have a proxy up by next week.
Have I missed anything?

One interesting (but maybe off-topic) facet of client-side applets (a la
Java) is the fact that publishers can define proprietary protocols and file
formats, and change them as often as they want, giving a sort of minimal
protection against casual duplication and re-publishing. With a bit more
work, the formats could make true transclusions efficient and easy to apply,
and help increase the amount of serious/commercial information available to

@_subject: FBI seeks huge wiretapping system 
In today's San Jose Mercury, online edition. Forgive me if this has already
been passed around.
FBI seeks huge wiretapping system
BY JOHN MARKOFF
New York Times
The FBI has proposed a national wiretapping system of unprecedented size and
scope that would give law enforcement officials the capacity to monitor
simultaneously as many as one out of every 100 phone lines in some high
crime areas of the country.
Such a surveillance ability would vastly exceed the current needs of law
enforcement officials around the country, who in recent years have conducted
an annual average of less than 850 court-authorized wiretaps -- or fewer
than one in every 174,000 phone lines.
The plan, which needs congressional approval for the money to finance it,
would still require a court warrant to conduct wiretaps. Still, the proposed
expansion of the government's eavesdropping abilities raises questions among
industry executives as to why the FBI believes it may require such broad
access to the nation's phone network in the future.
And privacy-rights advocates see the specter of a Big Brother surveillance
capability whose very existence might encourage law enforcement officials to
use wiretapping much more frequently as an investigative tool.
``A proposal that envisions some form of electronic surveillance for one of
every 100 telephone lines would be frightening to many people,'' said James
Dempsey, deputy director at the Center for National Security, a public
policy organization in Washington. ``I think law enforcement needs to be
honest with the public about what its intentions are.''
Generally, FBI officials contend that an advanced, high-capacity monitoring
system will be necessary as more of modern life and business -- and crime --
takes place as voice or computer conversations over digital phone lines.
On digital lines, communications are transmitted in electronic pulses
represented by the 1's and 0's of computer code. Such communications are
harder to monitor than with the old-fashioned analog lines in which
conversations are
transmitted as electronic signals corresponding to audible sound waves.
An FBI spokesman declined to elaborate on the bureau's perceived need for
such an expansion of its wiretapping abilities.
``The full implementation is absolutely essential for law enforcement and
public safety,'' said Mike Kortan, an FBI spokesman in Washington. ``We are
in ongoing discussions with the communications industry. Therefore it would be
inappropriate to comment further at this point.''
The plan, which was published in the Federal Register on Oct. 16 but has not
drawn much attention yet outside law enforcement and industry circles, is
the first comprehensive outline by the FBI of the surveillance capabilities
it will require under the controversial Digital Telephony Act that was
signed by President Clinton in 1994.
The law was adopted in the closing hours of the previous Congress after the
administration overcame telephone industry resistance to the extensive
network equipment changes that will be required to permit digital
wiretapping. In order to overcome that opposition, the administration
promised that the government would allocate $500 million to help upgrade
industry networks.
Whether the law will ever go into effect is an open question, because it
requires a federal appropriation, to be paid for out of criminal fines and
penalties, that Congress has not yet authorized. The budget legislation now
pending on Capitol Hill has no proviso for the digital wiretapping money,
although the House budget bill included a wiretapping allocation until last
The House measure was deleted after objections from several freshman
Republicans, including Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, a former federal
prosecutor, who said that he objected to the way the money for wiretapping
would be raised and that he had concerns about how the FBI might use such a
sweeping surveillance ability.
But some lawmakers say the Clinton administration, which has vowed to veto
the current federal budget bill, saw little point in pushing for inclusion
of the financing for the wiretapping at this time.
And others note that money for the digital wiretapping plan, presented as a
tough anti-crime measure, could be difficult for lawmakers of either party
to oppose outright. The FBI and the Clinton administration are expected to
continue seeking funds in the future.
The scope of the FBI plan has startled telephone industry executives, who
said it was difficult to estimate how much it would ultimately cost to carry
out the capacity increases. The officials are worried, however, that if
federal funds are not forthcoming, the government may attempt to shift the
financing burden to the rates that businesses and consumers pay to use the
telephone network.
``The difficulty in this process is going to come down the road when they
ask us to redesign our entire systems and not pay us,'' said Larry Clinton,
associate vice president for governmental affairs at the U.S. Telephone
Association, an
Washington-based industry lobbying group. ``If they try to make rate payers
pay for this we will run into serious and perhaps even constitutional
problems which we hope to avoid.''
The FBI plan, as filed in the Federal Register, calls for designating each
local telephone as falling under one of three categories. Category I would
be made up of urban areas, where most electronic surveillance currently
takes place. In
these regions, telecommunications carriers would be required to make
available up to 1 percent of their network capacity when sought by
law-enforcement officials.
In lower-crime urban and suburban areas, designated Category II, phone
companies would need to make available up to five-tenths of a percent of
their network lines, while the predominantly rural low-crime Category III
areas would require
0.25 percent.
For many of the most densely populated metropolitan areas, like New York,
Los Angeles and Chicago, there are tens of millions of phone lines. The FBI
document contends that in such places, the demands of digital wiretapping
may make it
necessary to intercept tens of thousands of phone calls at once.
Some industry officials said they were at a loss to understand how the
government expected to make use of such requirements. At an industry
gathering last year, telephone industry executives discussing the Digital
Telephony Act could not think of an example of more than seven wiretaps ever
being run from a single phone company office at any one time, according to
Ron Peat, director of federal legislation analysis for the Pacific Telesis
Group, the San Francisco-based regional Bell company.
Some technology experts said that the FBI's projected needs, which the
bureau said were based on historical records and on demographic data and
market forecasts, reflect a growing belief by law enforcement that
electronic surveillance will rapidly increase in importance in the digital
age, where most communications will take place using an array of mobile
computerized devices.
``These are staggering numbers,'' said Mark Rasch, director of information
security law and policy for Science Applications International Corp. in
McLean, Va. ``Either they do a lot more wiretaps than they now admit, or
they plan
on doing a significant larger number of wiretaps in the future because of
the fear of domestic terrorism.''

masquerade as Injuns in the 1800's and waylay Pony Express riders in order
to intercept communications between targeted parties. This practice lost
popularity towards the end of the century with the advent of boxed cereal,
and with it the Lone Ranger Decoder Ring, since the operatives were too

A common way to get around prostitution sting operations is to ask the lady
to expose sensitive portions of her anatomy to prove her sincerity before
the would-be customer commits to any transactions; this sort of thing is
also becoming commonplace on the net for pornography or pirated software,
too. Would-be trafficers often ask a prospective recipient for a small chunk
of fresh files in advance, before passing back anything serious .. partially
out of suspicion, mostly out of greed, but to the same end. A law
enforcement team would be stepping onto shaky ground if they were forced to
transfer illegal images/etc to a suspected trafficer before getting evidence
from him. Entrapment is an ugly concept.
Not at all .. a porn distributor could generate a key pair, use part A to
encode the images, and dessiminate part B thru a variety of outlets -
publicly posted, sold, passed thru an informal network of like-minded
I would argue the exact opposite - strong crypto would tend to minimize the
effective take, since there's no guarantee that /anything/ on a perp's
system will be in the clear. I'll let someone else with a better background
pound on the 'brute force' section.
