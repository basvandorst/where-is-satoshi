We now post the virus warning dialog on local files (file: urls).  We have
always posted it on remote files (http: urls).  Note that the root of the
problem is not Java or the browser, but in macro-enabled applications.  IE3
has a mechanism to warn users about safety of documents when used with
common macro-enabled applications.  We are have updated Microsoft Word such
that by default it will not run macros embedded in documents.

Actually I think its thier lack of foreseeing how a produbt can and will be
used.  Problems throughout thier line of products show this off.
Most of thier products are a creation of Microsoft anyway, they've stolen,
borrowed, purchased or purchased the company to obtain their products, then
added features upon features so they can market the hell out of it
to become  in market share. Many cases they've taken a reliable product
and made it less than reliable.
  I don't understand why people continue to support Microsoft they way they do!
   Ponder the thought of Microsoft buying up every web server/broswer
  company in the first year or two of the WEB?  Would it have made it where
  it is today?    Ponder the thought of Micorosft having ultimate control over the
  IETF
BTW: When is this list/listserver going to convert the reply-to fields to      point to cypherpunks

mailto: links take you to a anonymous remailer web page that lets
          you choose among remailers.
 news: can be read anonymously but posting doesn't seem to work yet.
 If converts all links in a page to use the service.
 Some info does get through , such as your broswer type.
 Soon, i guess browsers programmers will start passing info there!
 Don't know what happens with shttp:? anybody tried?
 Slowness is probably because the "service" is free and they don't
  have the funds for more horsepower.
 They do claim that they cache documents, so if one person gets
  a page from a slow server then everyone else can get it faster.
  (of course they'd have to be faster!)

of this is simply not to enter your personal info when setting up Netscape?  Granted the page can pick up your ISP and what port you used, but so what?  It can't get your name and em
ail address.  Use a newsreader such as Free Agent so there's no reason to enter your personal info.  If there is a reason to respond to someone who's email is in on a particular page, then copy it and paste to your emailer... >
  I don't like getting the junk-email after visiting some pages, telling
  me what a great service they have (Hey I was just there!!), etc.

  Funny, they didn't leave an email address?
  Probably don't even know what lists this is be posted to!
  For the money you probably get info on how to call your
  mortgage company and find out if makeing smaller/earlier payments
  will reduce the principle and the interest re-caculated.
  Then invest the money you save to earn interest!
  I know several people who do this.  You don't make extra payments
  just divde your $1000 month (or whatever) into 3 $333.33 payments.
  You need a sizable principle/long term loan for this to
   be worthwhile, and of course a properly worded mortgage.

@_subject: position of cellular phones 
-->I thought this would be of interest:
There is an interesting article in Traffic Technology International, Aug/Sept 96 issue about a system called CAPITAL that uses cellular phone calls as a probe to monitor road traffic around Washington DC.  It describes an experiment which has been running for two years and which has demonstrated that this is an extremely cost-effective alternative to conventional means of traffic monitoring.
The system is independent of the cellular phone system per se, but has antennae on the cellular phone masts which listen to the cellular frequencies. Every time a call is initiated, CAPITAL locates the caller by a combination of directional multi-element antennae and time-of-arrival analysis between different masts.  The geographical accuracy is reported to be to about 115m, and subsequent tracking allows the speed of the vehicle to be established within 30 to 50sec to an accuracy of 5mi/h.
At any time only less than 5% of vehicles are making calls, but this is a sufficient sample for analysing the traffic speed (though not presumably the traffic density).  Moreover, when the traffic slows down even more people make calls, so there is a better density of data from the areas most interesting to those monitoring traffic flows.
It is claimed that the boxes ignore the voice content of the call and that the data they deliver has randomly assigned identifiers for each call, so that nothing leaves the system which would allow calls to be associated with specific phones.
