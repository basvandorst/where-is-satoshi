---------------------
I guess you mean: from Bank B to Bank A
In my understanding - and I'm sure Marcel van der Peijl :-) will correct me :-(
if I'm wrong - the only way Bank B can verify with Bank A that the
ecash it has received from merchant B has not been spent before is by
actually sending the _coins_ to Bank A.  Hence there _is_ a transfer from
Bank B to Bank A and thus Bank A has to credit Bank B's account...

@_subject: Belgium has 'key escrow' law 
Surprise, surprise.  Today's issue of 'De Standaard', Flanders' most
respected newspaper, reports that - much to everybody's amazement - Belgium
has a key escrow law in working order - or almost...
The newspaper states that certain articles of a much 'broader' law that was
passed on the 21th of December 1994, if enforced - which to date has _not_
been the case, would imply that encryption of computer messages is illegal
unless the private key is registered with the BIPT (the Belgian Institute
for Postal services and Telecommunication; a government administration that
regulates the telecom sector).
At the time of enactment these articles went almost completely unnoticed -
hence the amazement.  As mentioned, said articles are not enforced yet but
it now appears that a working group, called Belinfosec (Belgium Information
& Security), led by a colonel of the military intelligence services - no
less, is preparing a report which would contain further specifications and
would propose enacting clauses.
Note that at present there is already legislation up and working that
enables Belgian law enforcement to tap telephone lines 'in specific
circumstances' (i.e., suspicion of criminal or terroristic activities).
Judging by the newspaper article it will not be long before this will
include computer messages.
Asked for a reaction, officials from the banking sector reacted with both
disbelief and outrage.  The article quotes the head of security at Banksys
(the interbank consortium that operates Belgium's nation-wide
ATM/POS-network) who considers it to be "unacceptable" and "an intrusion on
privacy" if government authorities  were to be able to monitor all the
money flows that pass through the Banksys network.  He also fears that once
revealed to the authorities, the keys might fall into the wrong hands, thus
jeopardizing the system's security.
I'll try to find out more and keep you informed.
P.S. I'm not on the cpx mailing list, so please Cc me.

@_subject: More on Belgian 'key escrow law' 
I looked up the law mentioned in the newspaper article and it goes like
this (non french speaking cypherpunks, please see comments below ):
"Loi du 21 décembre 1994 portant des dispositions sociales et diverses" -
published in the 'Moniteur Belge' (= the official journal in which all laws
are published), Vol. 164, Nr. 250, Friday 23 December 1994, p. 31878-31963.
(p. 31960-31961):
                                        Art. 202
        Il est inséré dans la loi du 21 mars 1991 portant réforme de
certaines entreprises publiques économiques, un article 70bis, rédigé comme
        <>"
(p. 31961):
                                        Art. 203
        L'article 95, alinéa 1er, de la même loi est complété comme suit:
        <<5° l'appareil terminal rends inefficaces les moyens permettant,
dans les conditions prévues aux articles 88bis et 90ter à 90decies du Code
d'instruction criminelle, le repérage, les écoutes, la prise de
connaissance et l'enregistrement des télécommunications.>>"
Simplifying it all seems to boil down to this:
The 1994 Law ammends a 1991 Law; that is, it adds a couple of
Art. 202 stipulates that Belgacom (= Belgium's leading telephone company)
and other telecom companies have to cooperate with law enforcement when it
wants to tap telephone lines - no, sorry, make that telecom lines (!).
Note that tapping is only allowed under certain circumstances stipulated in
the so-called Privacy Law (see also my previous posting to this list).
Art. 203 is the most important as far as key escrow is concerned.  It
completes Art. 95 of the 1991 Law which stipulated 4 conditions in which
telecom equipment may be seized. These initial conditions are rather
harmless (equipment does no longer conform to the initial specifications,
it hinders public broadcasts, presents health risks for the users,...).
Art. 203 adds a 5th and stingy one: equipment that makes tapping impossible
may be disconnected from the network and seized ...  On the face of it -
I'm not a lawyer, so don't pin me down on this - this means no crypto (or
only with key escrow) ...
