Err, actually, no.  She has memories of at least one other personality
from the age of 4.  Her memory is quite good...she has memories of sexual abuse
(I won't go into details) at age 3.  :( :(

@_subject: ytalk help 
Help!  I got ytalk from soda.berkeley.edu and compiled it.  Now it complains
it can't find the ytalk daemon!  There's a ytalkd.c, but it won't compile, and
there's no target in the Makefile for ytalkd.  Help!!!  The documentation is
a big lose, and the author doesn't answer his email :( :(

[excellent reasoning by Mr. Broiles deleted]
Also, as in the case of newsgroups such as alt*.abuse.recovery, the very
fact that your perp might be on the net, and harass or attempt to extract
revenge or retribution for posting, is a great reason to be anonymous.
There is a very real threat that if you post about your perp and he finds
out who you are, you might find yourself facing the business end of a
rather large, loaded, gun in the hands of a very pissed-off individual.

Just do what I do - laugh at LD's posts.  They're funny, they really are. Even the 'shoot XXX in the head' death threat posts are pretty ludicrous. I usually like to start my day by reading a post by LD - it gets me in a
good mood for the rest of the day... :)

The North Dallas Tollway already *has* such a gadget.  Pretty cool, too...
Oh .. did you ever figure out why he called *you*???

I just wish everyone on this list would either GROW UP or SHUT UP.  Take
your little flame wars and "my sysadmin is bigger than your sysadmin"
childish tantrums and threats and promises and anything else that doesn't
directly relate to what these lists were formed to discuss and take it to
alt.flame, huh?  What an ungodly waste of time and bandwidth...

Agreed.  I always hit 'd' when I see something with Detweiler in the
subject line, but my finger's getting sore.  Maybe I oughta get off my
lazy a** and let elm's filter program do the work, eh? :)

Where can I get a copy of this, or just the patches to patch RSAREF?  Or
even D-H itself would be nice - I'd like to hack together an encrypted
telnet/rlogin suite for use when I'm on the road, so I can get into my
system at the house from the laptop and not have to worry about someone
snarfing my login/password combo...
I've got RSAREF, BTW ... haven't looked at it much, though...
