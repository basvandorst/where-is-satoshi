While we talking abut anonymous proxies. I always wanted to set up an IP
anonymous proxie using Linux IP tunnel and maybe also IP Masquareding. This would allow people to have anonymous Web Servers, etc.
(But as anything it would probably be abused for hacking, etc at no end).
Any commments?

    Adam Shostack The problems with SSL extend beyond the random
number generation hole widely publicized in the press today.
SSL 2.0 poses both financial and interoperability barriers
to widespread use of Cryptography that will be addressed
in the very near future.
Establishing a secure Internet connection requires any computer software program to perform two functions: Authentication of the user, and bulk encryption of data.  The Authentication phase allows two computers to verify that each party is who they claim to be, and that they are authorized to enter into a secure communications session.   This is done via "public key" technology, which was developed and patented originally by Stanford University and licensed exclusively by CYLINK Corporation.
During the authentication phase the two computers also agree upon the encryption method to be used for bulk data transfer during the time the two computers are communicating data between one another.  These ciphers can be implemented in either software or hardware, including PCMCIA cards.  Popular encryption ciphers include DES, Triple-DES, SAFER, IDEA, Skipjack, RC-2 and RC-4 and are available from a variety of software and hardware vendors.

Actually it allows you to imbed data and commands to run. What the latest

(if you ever read the 40HEX virus magazine you should know how this works).
From there it just run the dropper.

Its a shame netscape does not make an agreement with someone like Red Hat (a commercial linux vendor) and supply a server for use with it. Iam sure if they can support a server for BSDI (therefor FreeBSD and NetBSD) they can support one for Red Hat (and there for Linux). But this does not belong in cypherpuns anymore. Nor are the people making this desitions in this list anyway.

be does the PGP pass phrase ever apper in a swap partition/file.
Well the swap space is an extention of memory, forming part of the virtual memory system. Obisouly PGP needs to read the passphrase into memory.
And Iam sure is goes out of it way to not keep it there for long. But on a loaded system PGP might get swaped out the moment it reads the passphrase.
Further more if the system happens to crash at that instant the passphrase will be keept in the swap space. But this is true for any piece of memory, PGP passphrase, or not.

I have not idea about what Iam about to talk.
This is a midnight rant. Take it as it is.
I just finished reading the article on Holographic Memories on the latest
Scientific America by Demetri Psaltis and Fai Mok. At the end they mention that "Given a hologram, either one of the two beams that interfered to create it can be used to reconstruct the other. What this means, in a holographic memory, is that it is possible not only to orient a reference beam into the crystal at a certain angle to select an individual holographic page but also to accomplish the reverse. Illuminating a crystal with one of the stored images gives rise to an approximation of the associated reference beam, reproduced as a plane wave emanating from the crystal at the appropriate angle."
you can obtain the other. No this convined with the fact that you need
to know the right angle could make for some interesting stuff. You could make a system where you give it the initial angle and password which is illuminated into the cristal to reveal the encoded data add to this some feadback mechanism where the angle changes depending on some function of the data and things get interesting.
to heard them. Good nite.

Who ever said that Java cant write to file are not in their right mind.
Those who belive it are more so. Java is a programming language. It can
certanly write to files. Now whatever an interpreter (in this case called
by HotJava or Netscape ) allows the application to do is another thing.
You can as well distribute binary C programms but before running them
try to examine it to see if access the filesystem. (You might even hack
your kernel or libraries to stop any process with certain flag from doing so). Java just makes this easier. You can even set up the HotJava browser to do no security check at all. All depends in the security model you choose.
Dito for net connections or anything else.
Now if all of you would please go use the product or learn more about it before bashing it I would not have to waste my time reaplying to this.
See about. Read the hotjava man page.

restrictions and more under HotJava (and hopefully Netscape)?
That does not compute. Granted Java is certanly more complex than postscriptm

No I think you did. The main point I guess was that there system acomplished
athentication, as well as privacy. But like I said lite on the technical side. And I agree, it spent more time talking about what it encryption,
public keys exchange, and certificates, than answering what diferent in their system than any of the otehr out there.

or its employees in such a short time and with so little evidense.
Yes, I like you, dont want to see GAK on Netscape products. But this
is ridiculous. It reminds me of the Microsoft Win95 fiasco. (And I do hate
Microsoft). Remember all the heat they took just because someone claimed
that the installation software took a snapshoot of your system and network
and then gave it to Microsoft through the MSN. It even made it into trade
magazines like InformationWeek. Of curse they then had their tail between
their legs when they realized that it was just the registration wizard
that asked for permission and that the information uploaded was much
less intrusive.

Another interesting tid bit is thta the code for Microsfot Internet
Explorer is licensed from Spry which has lincensed Java from Sun so
theoricly Microsoft will get Java for free (so to speak) now the question
is wheather they will be stupid enough to strip it out of their product
because they want to push VB.

Its interesting to note that all the people that were raving mad about Java
seem to be quiet now that MS is proposing to use VB. At least Java was designed from the ground up with security in mind. But VB? Actual binary
DDL running around. Just as an explame look at Oracles new PowerBrowers.
They have what they call CSP (or client side processing) which are just that
VB DDL's that you keep in your machine and if you dont have one d/l.
Now their docs say that once you download all it does is warn you
so you can authenticate it and scan it for viruses. This is not good.
Wanna bet who many people dont? And this is not like Netscape plug ins.
Where Netscapes plug ins are ment to handle major content types (like streaming video) and you would get them from a company that then you can sue,
CPS are ment to be used anywhere fron plugins type apps down to Java type applets like a ticker tape (their exmaple).
Also not that Oracle included BASIC as their client side scripting language.
By readin gthe web pages I saw that the scripts seem to have access
to the clients history, profile, et la. Anyone for a "Hack Oracle Content"?
I will d/l today an play with it, if I mind by guess true who will give
me a t-shirt?

I don't understand why this group continues to tolerate these compleatly
stupid messages from Mr. Anonymous (and other nuts.) (The message is
really just a llame by Detweller (sp?), as it indicates). I've also said
this b4 but I'll say it again: why would anyone in their right mind pay any

You might want to have a doctor help you take your head out of your ass.
