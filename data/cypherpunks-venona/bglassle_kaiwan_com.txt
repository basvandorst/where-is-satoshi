@_subject: Lotus Notes RSA Implementation Question 
I am currently considering using Lotus Notes for a group-ware solution
where security is of great importance.  I have studied Notes
documentation regarding thier implementation of the RSA encryption
library, but it leaves some unanswered questions.
If anyone on the list has knowledge of the following items, I would be
very gratefull.
1)  What is the key size used by the USA licensed version?
2)  Considering RC4 is a proprietary scheme, have there been any
concerted efforts to validate it's strength or lack of?  If so, could
you give a pointer to any documents I could review.

I would assume since they are using a key size >40 bit, it is used for
authentication only, not for data encrytion, that would skirt the ITAR
regs.  If fact according to the docs, there is no data encryption when
connecting to an international version server, regardless of the
client version.
I would assume that a >512 bit key in V4 would allow upwards of 1024
or better.  That should be sufficient for now.
My understanding was that the problems exposed with RC4 that you
mentioned, were with the particular implemenation by Netscape.  I
guess I better go back to the archive and do some reading. :-)
Thanks, for the info.

@_subject: M$ CryptoAPI Question 
With the current releases of the NT 4.0 betas, I would assume some of
you have had the chance to look at the API more closely.  I am getting
ready to hack my first crypto enabled app and wondered if this was
worth using or if Crypto C++ is the way to go. I would think that if their implementation is solid, and some of the
*real* crypto gods write stronger CSP's than the M$ RSA Base CSP, this
would be a good approach to get more enabled apps accepted for regular
Any thoughts?

Exploration of the internals are critical for any crypto
implementation.  Unfortunately, this is beyond the scope of my skills,
and requires me to rely upon the talents of you guys, ( Thanks! :) Of some relevance: (not intended to branch off topic)
I work at a large corporation who has a strong relationship with MS.
We had a MS Internet Architecture guru in here trying to sell us on an
NT Internet server solution as opposed to Sun which we use now.
We expressed our concerns about the security of NT  versus Unix in
regards to hackability, to which he responded. (paraprhased) NT is more secure than Unix since NT is newer, few people know anthing
about it, where Unix has known, documented holes in security. (Albeit plugged ones. ed.) With this *security through obscurity* outlook, I think exploration is
definatley in order.
Now that's a scary thought!  I need to look further into how they
implement authentication of CSPs.
