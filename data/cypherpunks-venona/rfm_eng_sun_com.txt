Libernet             Interested people are definitely invited to attend PenSFA parties
(though not to "co-opt" them..), but we prefer not to post the meeting
notices to random mailing lists since they include hosts' addresses and
phones.  [Edgar didn't know this because I failed to tell him; my
fault, not his.]  But please don't forward the whole Winnie on to other
lists. (Especially, don't post it to USENET...)
If you'd like more information on PenSFA, email me, I have a information
handout to give you; also email me to get on the list for more announcements.
