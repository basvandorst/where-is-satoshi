@_subject: Netscape & open NNTP servers 
I've got a question that I feel like I *should* know the answer to, but don't.
Say I configure Netscape to point through an open http proxy, and then connect t
an open NNTP server.  I don't know much about how proxies work.  Does the NNTP connection go through the proxy or directly from my machine?  As I understand it
if it does the first, then I don't have to worry about the NNTP server's log file, if any.  But if it does the second, I do.
Am I in the ballpark here?
ObCrypto: Not-readily-traceable posting with less hassle than a mail-to-news gateway seems to have some privacy relevance, even if it's not directly crypto.

@_subject: Open NNTP servers and logging 
A little while back there were some very helpful posts about getting started wit
open NNTP servers.  Since my regular site runs kinda slow in the news department
I've been having fun poking around and seeing about getting more current.
Then it dawned on me.  People keep logs.  Presumably routine logging would point
right back at my ISP, and from there it'd be not too hard to pin down me specifically.  No, I don't think anyone is particularly *likely* to do that, but
why take chances?
So...anyone know of open NNTP servers that *don't* keep logs?  Or some other way
around the problem?

I wish that didn't make so much sense to me.  I can certainly see things from th
sysadmin's point of view.
That's exactly what I'm doing for the moment.  After my current job starts payin
I'll shop around services like C2 and see who has a faster news feed than my current ISP.  Things take way too long to get here sometime.
By the way, plug plug plug, I wrote up a short set of instructions on posting through gateways with Private Idaho and put it on alt.security.pgp.  An Alta Vista or Deja News search would turn it up.  I can also mail it out to anyone wh
would like a helping hand with it.
