In the same vein, a 32 bit OS2 version would be nice.
  I'm not sure how brutessl works exactly, but if it could connect to the server, get its key assignments, and then chug away while disconnected from the net I could see what kind of speed I get out of my 40MHz 486.

@_subject: OS/2 Brute SSL binary 
After an evening of installing emx+gcc for OS/2 I have gotten a compiled binary to run on my machine. Its chugging away at 5100 keys/sec.
  If you want to try out my binaries, ftp over to:
  ftp.eskimo.com/~blane/brutessl/bruteos2.zip
  I have included the .exe, the .txt file and the .pf files for hals 2 challenges and the test.pf
  I think I have it compiled so that you don't need emx.dll on your system, but I can't test it(I have emx installed). Let me know of any problems.
  I tried the os/2 binaries from the ftp.brute... site, but they insisted on running the DOS command.com shell, and then dying with an error.
  Good luck!

I believe the code is in the cookbook archive at ftp.ee.ualberta.ca, but when I just tried to confirm I got timeouts.

Guys, I think this has gotten a little silly. Trying to claim that anyone 'stole' a single word title is equivalent to Microsoft trying to tell other OS makers that they can't call their graphical frame things 'windows' because they thought of it first.
  The word 'Hackers' is a description of a group of people. It means different things to different folks (personally I like the definition/descriptions in Stephen's book) but since it is so widely used I don't see how anyone can claim to have had it stolen from them.
  Just as a side note, Stephen's book 'Hackers' had a substantial influence on me when I read it, and it holds a honored place among my collections of books.

I also noticed that on page 35 Chrysler has awarded Philip Zimmerman a 1995 Chrysler Award of Innovation in Design. Its nice to see large corporations taking notice cryptography.

I seem to remember a product from Sony last year that had a CDROM drive in it, a small LCD display, and a minimal keyboard. I think it was meant for reading encyclopedias or something.
  What would be cool would be a small device like this with a Magneto Optical drive in it. Generate yourself a large one-time pad and off you go...
  Or, you could have a secure messaging system (running a stripped down version of PGP) that could connect to a host via POP3 protocol (thru a internal modem of course)  handle your mail, etc.

Ah ha! Now I understand what this argument has been all about. This is not a flaw with PGP, but with the software doing the signing. It should/could add a line with a time and date stamp inside the signature envelope, or Bob could add more information, making the message more specific.
  I don't think PGP needs to be 'fixed', but the signing software    Brian
