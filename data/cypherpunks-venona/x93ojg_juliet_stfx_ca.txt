@_subject: PGP 
Does anyone know what the laws are regarding the export of PGP into Canada?  I know that it is not allowed to exported overseas but what is the ruling on into Canada.  Some sites say that it can be exported into Canada and others say that it can't.  Can anyone out there give me some information on this topic?

I have got to agree with Martin.  If you split the group a lot of us a going to subscribe to both groups so when people submit this stuff and cross post it we are going to get two copies of the same message.  I think I can speak for most people when I say that I don't need that extra mail volume.

I think people may have misunderstood me.  I am able to get PGP, I just want to know if it is legal for me to do so as I want to install it on a network and am not a big fan of jail.  It would do serious things to my future in the Canadian military.  All I wan't to know quite simply is "Is it legal for me to ftp a copy of PGP.  The MIT site says that it is OK as long as I am exprting it to Canada for use on a machine in Canada.  Although other sites say that it is not permitted to be exported to Canada.

@_subject: (PGP in Canada) another new question. 
Is pgp able to be put on a university network and used by all the students?  I am again referring to use in Canada.

I already downloaded a copy last week but I deleted it because I didn't knwo if it ws legal to use it and my Sys admin would probable revoke my account if it was illegal.  I was talking to him and he told me that if I can prove that it is legal he will let me use it.

Hey Boffo, Don't be an idiot!!  It is hard to turn off your modem when you are on a university network.  Don't be so quick to be a smart ass.  If you don't have anything productive to say then shut the fuck up!!
