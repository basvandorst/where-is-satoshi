I guess you can call the source credit.asm, sniffer.c, capture.bas or
any number of other names, too...geez, there's another few zillion.
Another trojan horse.

Far as I can tell you can't hook the keyboard this way, just ask people to
give you the number.  And then you can only send it back to wherever the
applet came from.
I count 4.

Any one up for a distributed brute force attack on single DES? My    back-of-the-envelope calculations and guesstimates put this on the
   hairy edge of doability (the critical factor is how many machines can
   be recruited - a non-trivial cash prize would help). Not quite sure what you mean by "doability" -- it's obviously doable,
it just depends how long you want to wait.
