Educational Cryptanalysis Competition  (opened 17 July 1996)
Cypherpunks teach.  Here's your chance.
I have a piece of code I wrote ages ago, before reading Schneier.
Despite identifying these points as weaknesses I still cannot
break it.
    weak keys
    rapid collapse in the case of chosen text attack
    reduced-round versions have a correlation attack
Obviously my crytanalysis needs some serious help.
The aim of this competition is:
    to show how to find AND EXPLOIT weaknesses in this cypher.
    Answers resembling "That's junk - use XXXXX." score zero.
    Well-prepared comprehensive answers could score highly.
- - Entries will be judged on educational grounds as well as on raw results.
- - All entries are placed by the entrant in the public domain, and there
  may be a compilation of good answers come out of this.
  (With entrants' names except where they state a prefernce for anonymity. )
- - Entries by teams are allowed.
- - The number of entries is unlimited.
- - The closing date is 30 Sept 1996.
- - The judge is Peter Allan. (me)
- - There is one prize (a box of chocolate coffee beans).
A full pair of programs using this code can be collected

I have a very crude + simple remailer using shell scripts.
There is re-ordering and a standard message size.
There is no scope for receipts or replies.
I limit messages to 1kb to make it harder to send images.
(There was once a management complaint about images- nothing
to do with me or the remailer which hadn't started then.)
It can only send and receive mail INSIDE the company.
I have not advertised it widely, for fear of a management veto.
It carries a warning to be sensible, and I'd be able to read
the mail log following complaints.
There is a short banned list, intended only to stop looping.

@_subject: secret sharing protocol - new or reinvented ? 
Schneier in That Book 2nd Ed p73
refers to "secret sharing with disenrollment",
but without giving details of such a scheme.
He gives a reference [1004] I think, by K Martin,
which has about 10 pages on the subject.
But I have not got it.
I planned a "secret sharing with disenrollment"
scheme last night.  Here is a brief description
and if somebody with the book tells me it's new
 (unlikely I think)
I'll write it up in more formally.  It has a resemblance to S/Key, but in the other direction
and using a keyed hash function.
If you see snags with this, I'd like to know.
Peter Allan  peter.allan
Trent chooses his shareholders, a block cypher (or keyed hash),
a threshold, and a number of steps.  The threshold should be more
than half the number of shareholders.
(Say 15 shareholders for a 10 out of 15 scheme,
using DES, over 20 steps.)
Trent generates 15 64-bit DES keys (not caring about parity),
and gives them securely one to each shareholder.  He introduces all
shareholders to each other so they can recognise each other later.
He also tells them the number of steps (here 20).
Trent (in possession of all shares) calculates the secret, which
is a 64-bit number.  Obviously this could just be a key for a
secret not yet created at share distribution time.
Secret calculation is performed by executing the required number
of steps, and the result of the last step is the secret. Disenrollment (conducted by shareholders, presumably under
orders from Trent) is the performance of one step, omitting
those to be disenrolled.  (The number of possible disenrollments
is limited by the threshold.)
One step is this set of actions:
   Using a normal threshold scheme, such as Shamir's Lagrange Polynomials
   a sufficient number of shareholders construct a single secret from their
   shares.  Call this M.  M is then used to update all their shares using a
   keyed hash function.
   Table 18.1 suggests      H_i = E H_i-1 (M)  XOR M
   M and every H_i-1 is destroyed.
   Now those absent from the meeting have no M value to advance
   their share, and nobody (even the other shareholders following
   a change of heart) can reproduce it for them.
   Shareholders deduct 1 from the number of steps still to be performed.

I guess it might have value as a part of another system, making a known plaintext

                   Strengthening Remailer Protocols
STATUS OF THIS MEMO
This memo proposes improvements for the Mixmaster protocol and
requests discussion and further suggestions.
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
Lance Cottrell's documents [1] and [2] describe the current Mixmaster
protocol and attacks against it.  This memo began as a response to
those thoughts, but has developed in discussion with Cottrell.
SPAMMING ATTACK
[2] describes an active attack where many messages are sent to an
honest remailer to separate a message of interest from other
traffic.  The aim is to clear other messages out of the message pool,
wait for the target and finally eject that from the pool.  The target
message is identified because the attacker can recognise  his own
Attempts to defeat this attack could well be based on preventing the
attacker from recognising his own messages.  That is the approach
taken here.
     RE-ENCRYPTION AS A SPAM DEFENCE
     In this diagram remailer 'A' has received a message addressed to
     himself.  Inside that is one to 'B' - unreadable to A.  Further
     layers are hidden of course.
                AB?????  decrypts to B?????
     This means that our remailer can only disguise the message by
     re-encrypting it on the outside.  But the message has got to
     make some net progress toward delivery.  The trick is that a
     remailer can find the outer two headers addressed to him and
     process both of them.  Two headers processed and one rewound is net
     progress.  When the header rewound is addressed to the same
     recipient as was next on the list anyway the diagram looks like
     this.
     Actions at 'A':            AB????? decrypts to  B?????
                                 B????? encrypts to BB?????
     Actions at 'B':            BB?????  decrypts to B?????
                                         decrypts to  C????
                                         encrypts to CC????
     The beauty of this is that it is compatible with the existing
     protocol.  If a remailer only knows about removing layers of
     encryption it still fits into a network where some can do both
     actions.  Whether it sends or receives the message it still
     works.
     RE-ENCRYPTION IN THE MIXMASTER ROTATING QUEUE MODEL
     Instead of layers like an onion, Mixmaster has a queue of
     headers that get rotated.  A used header goes to the back of the
     queue where it can never again be read.  At some point the
     header at the front of the queue is found to be the last one,
     and the message is sent on its final hop.
     For a header queue the above actions look like this:
     Actions at 'A':        AAAB???  -> AAB???a
                                     -> AB???aa
                                     -> BB???aa
     In general when the first H headers are addressed to the
     remailer reading them, (H-1) rotations will be performed, and
     the top header will be overwritten with another one with a
     random key and IV to encrypt the rest of the message.  The
     number of headers present remains 20, however many or few of
     these are still to be read.  No valid header block is ever
     overwritten, only used header blocks that are good for nothing.
     This is always possible because after a remailer receives a
     message at least the one header it has just read must be of no
     further use.
     This will hide the message content from eavesdroppers, but not
     from the next remailer in line - 'B'.  Assume that remailer B
     is operated by an attacker, and that he directs spam messages
     there after host A (which is holding your message in the pool at
     the time of the attack).  B can read all messages sent by the
     attacker (who knows B's private key).  This is also why I think
     link encryption offers incomplete protection.
     RE-ENCRYPTION WITH CHEATERS
     Mixmaster assumes that no particular remailer in the network can
     be trusted and that the user does not know which remailers
     cheat.  The message passes through a chain of remailers, who aim
     to hide information from each other so that the compromise of
     some of them will not disclose the original sender and final
     destination.
     Central to the spamming attack is the idea that the attacker can
     recognise the messages he is trying to trace.  This is done by
     eliminating  his own messages.   The whole set - not just
     some of them.  It can be arranged that the attacker does not
     obtain the whole set until it is too late to trace the target
     message (i.e. after a few hops, when it is likely to have met other
     legitimate traffic).  The partial information the attacker obtains
     before all the spams are identified will be of some use, but
     following each of several leads with a new spam attack is unappealing
     as the number of suspect messages will just grow.
     The remailer needs the freedom to divert packets to another
     remailer.  This is shown below; where remailer C was chosen at
     random.
     Actions at 'A':        AAAB???  -> AAB???a
                                     -> AB???aa
                                     -> CB???aa
     Each remailer could have three options when sending a packet to
     its next host.
        1) rotate all possible headers, and send the result  (current protocol)
        2) re-encrypt message with new 3DES key and IV.  Do not divert.
        3) re-encrypt message with new 3DES key and IV.  Divert at random.
     Good probabilities for these options might be:
        1) 20%   P(1) = P(3)  The number of headers the next host can read
                 should not reveal whether a diversion has just been made.
                 (We care about this because it discourages cheaters
                  deliberately refusing to pass on your mail.)
        2) 60%   Other outgoing packets are not distinguishable from spams.
        3) 20%   Should not approach 100%.
                 (To arrive is better than to travel in hope.)
     A spam attack as described in [2] would use many more packets
     than those in the message pool (N) on the host under attack.  The
     number of spam packets diverted to honest remailers (a
     proportion R of the whole) would be about
     and those diverted twice in succession to honest remailers would
     be about
     and I'd expect a figure above 5 here to thwart the spammer, because
     of the time taken to collect the 5 spams.
     This diversion (adding steps to the middle of a chain) seems different
     from a Middleman scheme [3] where extra hops are added at the end.
     This scheme does NOT allow a remailer to choose the rest of the
     chain to be followed.  A dishonest remailer cannot bypass any
     remailer chosen by the original sender (in the hope of following
     the message to its destination) using only cooperating dishonest
     remailers) because the message has been encrypted in the public
     key of each remailer the sender chose before it entered the
     network.

But the internet worm of 1988 was captured, decompiled and analysed in days.
Self-modifying viruses get analysed (by single stepping).  Your programs will

Kelsey wrote on 28th June about correlating messages at the points of
entry & exit from the remailer network.  I don't know what an attacker
gains by correlating _inside_ the net.
Here are the bits I omitted before.
DECOY MESSAGES
The sending of decoy messages by users is recommended, and serves to
hide statistical correlations between your sending a message and
somebody receiving one.  This practice should continue.  It is also
desirable that a remailer be able to originate decoy messages
Advantages include better traffic load following.  The remailer knows
when traffic is light and can generate more decoys.  This could be
important at times of low traffic such as public holidays.  It would
be especially important during a denial-of-service attack.  When an
attacker prevents messages from reaching the remailer (in the hope of
isolating a small number of target messages) a locally-produced set
of decoys, immune from the denial-of-service, could be crucial.
     DESTINATION
     Addressing all automatic decoys ultimately to "nobody" would
     ensure that they circulate in the network and then disappear.
     Nonconservation of message number should prove annoying to an
     eavesdropper.  (An implementation detail on this will be
     mentioned later.)
     Addressing some of them outside the network, to test newsgroups
     for instance might also be useful - confusing an attacker
     looking at the point of exit.
     NUMBER
     A possible means of matching the traffic would be to use an
     exponential- along the lines of those in thermodynamics.
               decoys = max  ( D.exp(-kT)  , E  )
     The "max" operator here ensures that every time a batch of
     messages is sent a minimum number of decoys will be included.
     Values for the constants can doubtless be suggested by remailer
     operators familiar with the traffic load.
SILENT SPAMMING
Re-encryption as discussed here will not do any good if
remailers allow "silent spamming".  To exploit this feature
the attacker addresses his messages to "nobody" (or "null"
in Mixmaster jargon).  These mails fill the message pool,
sweeping out all the target messages, but when they come to
be sent they disappear.  They do not show on the net, they
do not need to be recognised and eliminated from the
search.  All the attacker sees leaving the spammed host is
undiluted target mail.
Obviously the remailer should detect messages of this type and
process them without storing them in the message pool.  Any message
that will not be delivered to a remote host comes into this
category, including those to most local accounts.
I briefly examined the source of 2.0.3
(from ftp://utopia.hacktic.nl/pub/replay/pub/remailer on 11 July 1996)
and could not find code to deal with this attack.
[Cottrell tells me this is on the to-do list.]

This all hinges on a policy to be followed by archive holders defining
the conditions under which they release their shares.  This could be receipt of a signed request from the owner (remailer).
Maybe the table relating nyms to reply addresses could be stored in
netescrow style so that captured remailers reveal nothing.  The problem
of operator coercion is not addressed by this.
Police investigations might apply "angry mob cryptanalysis" to find
a sender - convincing a sizable number of operators that a crime had

Yes.  What I had in mind resembled the split list scheme used at a church I
used to go to.  UK tax law has concessions for regular giving (Covenants, in the jargon)
and the church needed to know that comittments were being met.  At the same time it was
preferred not to know who was giving what.  This was done by having 2 lists eg
Namelist:  Mr J Smith  = member 999
Cashlist:  member 999 gives  1000 / month
If member 999 didn't give as planned, cashlist-holder could say to namelist-holder
"have a word with 999".
These were held by 2 people, trusted not to collude.  Also I suppose committee
reshuffles shouldn't put one person straight into the other post.
My idea was to replicate this split list so that
addrlist:  leukos.gleukos  = index97b6150200000564
nymlist:   index97b6150200000564  = an0001002304000101
This would be altered for the remailer table as:
addlist: leukos.gleukos            = index97b6150200000564
addlist: an0001002304000101 = index97b6150200400281
and these 2 mappings would be escrowed:
index97b6150200000564 -> index97b6150200400281
index97b6150200400281 -> index97b6150200000564
(Or just escrow the _keys_ for the latter, as Matt first thought.)
The aim is to prevent a seized remailer having its data read.
The "angry mob cryptanalysis" is a side issue.

I did say this didn't address operator coercion.  The widespread
cross-jurisdiction aspects of netescrow will be important here.
Capture of hardware without scope for operator coercion would be
protected against - but is an easy problem anyway.

I was thinking of calling this the "shredder ticket" and giving it to
the sender (who can then distribute it to all remaining remailers without
needing to use the seized one).  This would depend on him realising that
the remailer was (about to be) seized, and would have to be done before
the enemy rounded up the shares.  [Incidentally I'm not that keen on
regarding the police as the enemy.  My mention of "angry mob cryptanalysis"

(Perhaps including compulsory cross-border secret reassembly. )
I was envisaging this being combined with Mixmaster.  (I see from your
Eternity post that you'd run a netescrow scheme that way.)  This gives
us "vertical integration"  a sort of "of the remailers, by the remailers
and for the remailers".  Careful design of message formats could make it
hard to tell the escrow mechanics from the traffic.  To mount this collusion
attack the TLAs would have to be part of the scheme - helping to pass most anonymous messages in order to trace some random ones, not necessarily those
they want to trace. (If there was nothing in it for them they wouldn't join.)
(Compare that to the current state quoted as near as I can remember from AC2
  "It seems reasonable to assume that the NSA can break any message that it
   intercepts, but not all messages")
It takes time to collect the shares and determine the next destination,
during this time the message is sat in a pool. (Is there scope for traffic
analysis in the fact that the average speed of messages will be lower
than that of shares ?)
With that in mind I was looking at the scope for cheating.
Cheating seems possible by:
1)  Collusion (as mentioned)
2)  Not releasing (valid) shares when requested
    This can be caught by traps.  The list of where the
    shares went is usually destroyed, but need not be.
    The shareholders are none the wiser, and when they get
    known for not releasing shares the remailer excludes them
    from future share issues.
3)  Flooding attacks - storing rubbish in escrow servers who
    are eventually forced to accept no more shares, or ditch
    some existing ones.  So far as I can see Matt's Netescrow
    scheme has exactly this problem.  Ecash payments might help.
    If existing shares are ditched the reply-ability will not last
    long.  You might get a message you can reply to for 2 weeks, but     no later.  Sender might resend periodically - a bit like following
    up an unanswered snail mail.

What about Walter making insignificant changes to the cleartext and
replacing the hash with the new hash?   Because you are using an unkeyed
hash (and not a sig) he can do that and foul up the stegomessage (not
that he'll yet be sure there is one).

So could anyone anyway by asking the TRP.  The TRP returns a Yes/No
answer, withou disclosing the session key.  Is your binding scheme motivated mainly
by avoiding that workload on the TRP ?  Or by the fact that everybody might
prefer a different TRP ?
I suspect the scheme is incomplete anyway.  After skimming the web page I
see that the aim is to show the same session key has been encrypted under
different ElGamal pubkeys.  Now who's to say those pubkeys belong to anyone ?
Or is this what is meant by "such as Margaret's identity" ?  You'd list the

I'm still puzzled as to what the point of the scheme is if
   other encryption is legal
or other encryption is undetectable.
It makes as much sense as a law against successful unaided suicide.
Here are 2 suggested solutions to the criminals' key management problem
allowing them to exploit Binding Cryptography.
Plan 1)
Ronald wishes to send a secret message to Margaret via a BC scheme.
He first chooses a session key and encrypts his message with it.
He hides the message in a stego file and signs it.
The session key he chose he now encrypts (ElGamal) with Margaret's pubkey.
He decrypts this with his own privkey to get a different session key.  Call this S.
(Cheats who trust each other could share a keypair so the message will not
appear to go to himself.)
He encrypts the signed stegofile with key S and sends it to himself
and Margaret and a few TRPs.
All observers agree the session key S was used all round.
The message even looks innocent if sampled by the TRP.
The stegocontent is only readable by Margaret's privkey
(reading the key-to-Ronald field).
This can be beaten by enforcing a random session key as opposed
to a derived one.  Make S be the output of a hash for which Ronald
proves in ZK that he knows the input.
(It is not clear from your description that you do this.)
Plan 2)
Use signed stego.
Base key exchange on Diffie-Hellman with the first cyphertext variable in the ElGamal scheme.   G=g**k
Or base key exchange on something internal to the stego, as desired.
Get half-baked politicians to see GAK isn't a vote winner and only
wastes money.  Unicorn says convincing government is impossible, but
if they care about nothing else, they listen for where the votes are.
Anyone wanting to find GAK-neutral work to think about could follow
a few of the IETF's working groups.  Why make something obnoxious ?

@_subject: A home for stego in source code ? 
The monarchist lightning-hater has been cracking the whip again.
Adam Back suggested several areas for investigation, including English text.
Some weeks ago somebody suggested using synonyms in natural language
to express stegodata.  A synonym for a word in the message would be
chosen from a defined set, and the choice that was made would express
a bit or several.  This seems related to the clever "alternate
dictionary" idea in RFC-1938.  But a lack of true synonyms (or
programs that understand natural language) make it look pretty
hopeless as a practical proposition.
SOURCE CODE A POSSIBLE CHANNEL
Even small programs often have several hundred symbols.  The names
given to these are mostly arbitrary, and they can be replaced
(consistently) by other names by a program.  In fact there "shrouded"
source code is sometimes released to make it less clear to the human
reader than the original source.
In this application the names would be chosen randomly from a set of
words and syllables (perhaps with some rules about which are
plausible together).  There is also a choice of StyleWithCaps and
If the symbols (in order of first appearance) all have a CRC
calculated on them I'd guess you could get 4 bits each without
There are also comments.  These might be natural language, debugging
code and never-really-got-this-working code.  Maybe a CRC on each
comment is worth 8 bits.   Comments of the form
   /* Thanks to P.McNicholas, M.Davies and WorpleSword
      for advising on the next section **/
could be added with random names quite well (although the user might
have to mark the complicated code fragments suitable for receiving
such attributions).  Names used could be lifted from a list of
known helpful programmers ...
And then there is layout.  The kind of thing that is standardised with indent(1).
This would be anti-standard in layout, choosing spacing and linebreaks and
spaces with the stegomessage in mind.
And some code constructions are capable of rewriting to add info to the message.
0==x , x==0
x>y  , x<y
i++  , ++i   (sometimes)
for  , while
if   , switch (sometimes)
Or variables could be added to hold intermediate values, and lengthen
the source as our desired effect.
There may be more scope for plausible stego in code that doesn't have
to work.  Next time you see a load of verbose mistyped rubbish called
"Help me with my program!!!" it could be someone who got this idea
ahead of me.
I've been dipping into "Understanding and Writing Compilers"
(Bornat, 1979).  (free, withdrawn from library)
It seems the early phases of a compiler build the symbol table as a tree
and do various bits of analysis on the source.  A good starting point for
a program might be a compiler - rip out the translation and optimisation
phases and add the stegoreader and stegogenerator.
KEYED V. UNKEYED STEGO
Assuming that the data hidden in stegofiles is random (keys or cyphertext)
the enemy is supposed to be unable to tell whether there is really a message
there.  An example of unkeyed stego is the use of LSB of each byte in an image
or audio file.  In contrast, the subliminal channel mechanisms written about by
Schneier use a key known to the intended reader.  In this application keyed
stego would seem to have an advantage over unkeyed in that the source could be
made to keep to a house style while retaining some stego capacity.  The seeds
for the CRCs and style info (resembling ./indent.pro ~/indent.pro) could be
user-defined.  I'd still wouldn't want to hide plaintext under it, but it
would give more flexibilty for the users.
Would anyone like to write a version ? Then we could test my guesses
about how many bits can be hidden.  It probably won't be close to 1 in 8, but I think 1 in 30 should be within reach.

with some wild statements - about the speed of brute-force

patents and key certification.
Also there are absolutely crucial issues not touched on,

to write it [subject to my boss' approval] or review it

 The Deviant  like this:
That is a bound on a _reliable_ algorithm.  A faster one is to shuffle
the elements and present it as sorted.  Lightning fast, but only with
low probability of correctness.  That is what we are up against in a key
search attack.  The other guy just might guess my 100 bit key first time,

@_subject: S/KEY (was: 2 Questions) 
S/Key has a rather limited scope, in aiming to prevent replay attacks.
These are where somebody snoops on your network to obtain passwords,
an uses them in later login attempts.  This is undoubtedly a major
weakness in most current networks.  S/Key addresses this replay of data
obtained in passive eavesdropping, but that is all it does.
Several attacks against S/Key have been discussed [1], including:
   race attacks:  eavesdropping most of the hash, and racing the user
                  to provide the rest of it
   active attacks:  impersonating the server to learn future hashes
                    or simply hijacking an established session.
Strengthening S/Key really means expanding the scope to get an
authenticated and encrypted 2-way connection.  [John Gilmore's S/WAN may
end up achieving this.  I'm not familiar with it (yet?).]
Ideas for improving S/Key that involve secret data stored on the server
tend to get frowned on, as the original aim was to avoid that.  In any case
you cannot get the full encrypted 2-way connection without getting a whole
lot more complicated.
Recent discussions [2] have centred on ways to rekey the list of hashes remotely when
the count runs down.  These changes, and S/Key itself, are better than nothing
but where's the ham sandwich ? [3]
Beside the protocol weakness there is potential for finding collisions in the hash
function (MD4 originally).  A choice of hash functions can be provided. See RFC-1938.
1) See also SecureID, which is more complicated and still subject
   to similar attacks.

@_subject: S/KEY (was: 2 Questions) 
S/Key has a rather limited scope, in aiming to prevent replay attacks.
These are where somebody snoops on your network to obtain passwords,
an uses them in later login attempts.  This is undoubtedly a major
weakness in most current networks.  S/Key addresses this replay of data
obtained in passive eavesdropping, but that is all it does.
Several attacks against S/Key have been discussed [1], including:
   race attacks:  eavesdropping most of the hash, and racing the user
                  to provide the rest of it
   active attacks:  impersonating the server to learn future hashes
                    or simply hijacking an established session.
Strengthening S/Key really means expanding the scope to get an
authenticated and encrypted 2-way connection.  [John Gilmore's S/WAN may
end up achieving this.  I'm not familiar with it (yet?).]
Ideas for improving S/Key that involve secret data stored on the server
tend to get frowned on, as the original aim was to avoid that.  In any case
you cannot get the full encrypted 2-way connection without getting a whole
lot more complicated.
Recent discussions [2] have centred on ways to rekey the list of hashes remotely when
the count runs down.  These changes, and S/Key itself, are better than nothing
but where's the ham sandwich ? [3]
Beside the protocol weakness there is potential for finding collisions in the hash
function (MD4 originally).  A choice of hash functions can be provided. See RFC-1938.
1) See also SecureID, which is more complicated and still subject
   to similar attacks.
2) Not here.
3) Old joke.  A ham sandwich is better than nothing, and nothing is better than
   a life of complete happiness, so ......

@_subject: Codebreakers delivered OK 
Thanks for the book, which arrived safely (last week,
when I was on leave and tiling my bathroom).
In mid-December I asked on this list whether people
would recommend buying books from Gary Rasmussen.
    Message-Id: <9612131954.AA28856
    Subject: Would you send money to Gary Rasmussen ?
I got several replies for, and none against.  Thanks
to those who replied.
I am now pleased to add my data point.  He has sent my copy
of Kahn's Codebreakers.  The delay from mid-December was almost
entirely caused by banking issues.  Money transfers are not as fast
or cheap as I think they should be in 1997.  Gary tells me he may in
future get equipped to take credit cards.
His catalogue contains stuff sure to interest anybody with plenty of time.
Here is his comment:
