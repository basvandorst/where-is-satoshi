This has been discussed on this list before, about 1 year ago.  The Computrace software is installed on a place on the hard drive where DOS utilities like Fdisk and Format can not get at it.  This is the same as Diskmanager Version 7 or higher, Fdisk and Format will not remove this version of Diskmanager.
The Computrace software is configured to call the 1-800 number on a regular pre-assigned schedule and talk to the computers at Absolute Software.  If the notebook has been reported stolen the computers at Absolute will advise the subject unit to call back on a more frequent basis.  The Computrace software turns off all modem speaker With all calls to a 1-800 number the calling number is reported to the call receiving site.  This is always the case and the calling party has no control over this feature, it just happens as the 1-800 number owner is paying for the call.  As a matter of interest this type of business could not be based in the USA as it is unlawful to use the calling number information gained through 1-800 calls for any business advantage or use, including this one.  However, US LEAs have no problem cooperating with Absolute Software and they do cooperate.
I have no connection to Absolute Software other than I visited their web site and I have a pretty good idea how they perform their promises.  I have no idea on how to remove the Computrace program unless it is on a Seagate or Western Digital hard drive.  Both of these manufacturers make low-level format programs for their IDE drive products available on their web sites and a low-level format will remove Diskmanager and I assume Computrace.
I assume most notebooks which are recovered are found to be in the hands of a buyer rather than the person responsible for the actual theft.  But, the eventual buyer is indirectly responsible for the initial theft of the notebook.

Legally Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) and the courts willl find you responsible for being in possession  of stolen property.  If you purchased the unit from a storefront or a person selling the unit from their home you could deflect responsibility to those parties.  I would suspect most stolen units are fdisk-ed,  re-formatted, and moved a minimum of a state or province and then sold through brokers who operate through a pager or cell phone.  The units are sold probably more in the range of $600 to $700 CAN Dollars for 486 color units and abit  more for Pentium units.  The brokers may offer the unit through an auction.
At this point the buyer should start to suspect something is not right, the units are too cheap and all the proprietary drivers have been removed.  The reason given is that they are being disposed of by a large corporation and it is policy to erase all data.  No manuals or documentation are offered with the unit.  Normally when you purchase an unit from the original retail buyer manuals and documentation and extras would be included with the unit and the seller would probably be willing to show you the bill of sale.  Would you buy a car from a seller offering no documentation or proof of It is tough to take the argument that stolen notebooks are the fault of the victim seriously.  Notebook thieves can be pretty enterprising.  They walk into offices dressed as maintainance people, buy pass keys from the real maintainance people and go through every office.  A friend had a notebook taken from a locked office in a supposedly secure area, no signs of break and entry so no insurance coverage and there were notebooks and computers taken from three locked offices in the middle of the day.  So in this case it was my friend's fault for doing business in a shared office environment where someone had sold a pass key to the thief??  If there was no market for stolen notebooks thieves would not steal them as there would be no gain.  In my experience most people selling merchanise of doubtful origins are not sophisticated, ask lots of questions and their stories quickly fall apart.  I have walked away from many deals when the origin of the goods were not clearly explained and I would suggest you do the same.
