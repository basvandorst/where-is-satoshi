MASTERCARD TO TEST IBM DIGITAL WALLET;
Software Will Open Market to Electronic Commerce
     MasterCard International Inc. this week expects to begin testing
its digital wallet developed by IBM Corp.  and will offer some of its
customers incentives to use the product.
     The move is expected to advance widespread acceptance of
electronic commerce and increase opportunities for Internet service
providers (ISPs) and software developers looking to capitalize on
what analysts say will be a huge market.
     The digital wallet, containing a digital ID card, should be
available to the mass market in the second half to end of 1997, said
Steve Mott, senior vice president of electronic commerce/new ventures
at MasterCard.
     After the IBM test, MasterCard will work with another set of
vendors and continue testing through the first half of '97, he said.
The other vendors probably will be CyberCash Inc., Netscape
Communications Corp., VeriFone Inc., Fujitsu, and Open Market, Mott
     In the first quarter of '97, testing will involve five to 10
merchants and 1,000 card holders, he said.
     The IBM digital wallet, part of IBM's CommercePOINT family of
products, is used with Netscape Navigator and incorporates the SET
(Secure Electronic Transaction) protocol.
     Mott said MasterCard wants to seed the market with the IBM
product. "They're going to be our guinea pigs," he said.
     In the next few weeks, Mott said, MasterCard will announce
agreements with U.S. banks, but declined to name them.
     Next month, MasterCard expects to release from its Web site the
SET Reference Implementation Code, which will show developers how to
build SET applications, he said. The implementation code, being
developed by Terisa Systems Inc., offers "an unambiguous application
of the code" to be used to build interoperable software, he said.
     SET will make credit card transactions more secure because it
provides confidentiality for payment information, insures integrity
for transmitted data and provides authentication.
     Ken Mohr, product marketing manager at Terisa Systems, said Visa
International Inc. and MasterCard are reviewing the first beta
version of the implementation code. The company is scheduled to
deliver the second beta version next month, he said.
     Terisa Systems hopes the second beta will be the last version
and that Visa and MasterCard will accept the implementation code in
the first quarter of '97, Mohr said.
Visa Testing in Europe
     Visa also is moving forward with efforts to implement SET. Last
week, it announced a pilot launch in Europe involving 38 Visa members
in 16 countries. A number of banks will be able to offer secure
electronic commerce within six months; full implementation of the
project will begin in the first quarter of 1998.
     "Electronic commerce will be global in nature, so it is
important we begin work on an international basis," Visa EU President
Hans van der Velde said in a prepared release.
     "SET is now robust enough to go to the single worldwide market
offered by the Internet and other networks," he said.
     Some vendors already have SET-ready products available. VeriFone
has its Internet Payment Solution that includes vPOS, vGATE and
vWallet to cover the three parts of an electronic transaction.
     Wells Fargo Bank is one of VeriFone's initial customers. The
bank is implementing vPOS and expects to launch the service to
merchants in mid-November, spokeswoman Janet Otsuki said.
     CyberCash has a Secure Internet Payment System with a CyberCash
Wallet, Secure Merchant Payment System and CyberCash Gateway Servers.
The system has been operational since April 1995.
     GTE has CyberTrust, which provides digital certificates that are
issued over the Internet to consumers with credit cards, Internet
merchants and institutions processing transactions.
     Terisa Systems is working on an as-yet-unnamed product to
implement SET into its SecureWeb Toolkit. A beta version will be
ready by year's end, Mohr said.
     Michael Goulde, an analyst with the Patricia Seybold Group,
predicted that the SET protocol will greatly lessen the perceived
risk of doing retail business over the Internet in 12 to 18 months.
     But, in a report written this month, he cautioned that there are
barriers to electronic commerce. "Consumers won't install the
software until it is seen as providing benefits, there won't be
benefits until merchants support SET, and merchants won't support SET
until consumers have the software.
     "This vicious cycle probably won't be broken unless Microsoft
provides SET-compliant software as an integral part of Windows in
1997," Goulde said.
     James Miller, a research scientist at the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C), predicted SET won't be widely available until
Christmas '97. He said consumers will take to electronic commerce
when one or two large companies figure out that security isn't such a
huge issue for consumers and go ahead with electronic commerce.
     In the meantime, W3C and CommerceNet have completed
specifications for the Joint Electronic Payments Initiative (JEPI).
JEPI provides a universal payment platform to allow merchants and
consumers to do business over the Internet using different forms of
     The SET protocol was scheduled to be included in the first phase
of JEPI, but work on SET was not completed in time, said Daniel
Dardailler, JEPI project manager. A second phase should begin by the
end of the year, and several companies, including VeriFone, have
agreed to participate, he said.
     The second phase, which is not publicly available, will set out
to validate the Universal Payment Preamble (UPP) logic put forward in
the first phase and add more payment systems, such as SET, and
micropayments, such as CyberCoin, Ecash and Digital Millicent,
Dardailler said.
     JEPI is a standard mechanism for Web clients and servers to
negotiate payment instrument, protocol and transport between one
another. It has two parts -- Protocol Extensions Protocol (PEP), an
extension layer that sits on top of http, and UPP, which identifies
the appropriate payment methodology. More information is available at

After petitioner's decedent distributed leaflets purporting to express
 the views of ``CONCERNED PARENTS AND TAX PAYERS'' oppos-
 ing a proposed school tax levy, she was fined by respondent for
 violating 3599.09(A) of the Ohio Code, which prohibits the distribu-
 tion of campaign literature that does not contain the name and
 address of the person or campaign official issuing the literature.  The Court of Common Pleas reversed, but the Ohio Court of Ap-

 held that the burdens 3599.09(A) imposed on voters' First Amend-
 ment rights were ``reasonable'' and ``nondiscriminatory'' and therefore
 valid.  Declaring that 3599.09(A) is intended to identify persons
 who distribute campaign materials containing fraud, libel, or false
 advertising and to provide voters with a mechanism for evaluating
 such materials, the court distinguished Talley v. California, 362
 U. S. 60, in which this Court invalidated an ordinance prohibiting
 all anonymous leafletting.

Lack Of Contracts Undermine Internet Transactions
By GEANNE ROSENBERG
Beyond the violets and refrigerated roses, in the back room of the
Southern Sun flower shop in Tallahassee, Fla., the florist, Bob Deak,
also deals in trading cards. With three computers and links to the Internet, Deak bargains with
collectable card buyers and sellers from as far away as Italy,
Australia and Singapore. He does not worry about the lack of paper
contracts to document the deals he strikes, even though the
transactions can run as high as $20,000 apiece. His profits, he said,
far outweigh the risks that a deal might go sour. One deal in particular led to a dispute - a $1,020 purchase of a card
collection last year from a 14-year-old, Ted Clark of Haddonfield,
N.J. Deak said ``youngsters'' selling cards sometimes do not understand
the meaning of ``near mint.'' So, after examining the cards he had
agreed to purchase in several installments, Deak decided they were
not in near-mint condition and canceled a couple of checks he had
written to Ted Clark and sold the cards for less than the original
purchase price. But Deak's actions did not sit well with Ted, now 16, especially
since Deak had made an electronic agreement.  Ted thought he had been
``rooked'' because he did not receive the full amount, said his
mother, Amelia H. Boss, a law professor at Temple University School
of Law and an expert on Internet commerce. She took Ted's case and,
with the assistance of a Florida colleague who served as local
counsel, contacted Deak and eventually persuaded him to pay the
balance of the money. Boss said these sorts of disputes are commonplace on the Net. But,
she said, the high cost of suing, especially across state and
national borders, prevent most such squabbles from making it to
court. The resulting dearth of test cases on digital contracts has
left many business managers, corporate lawyers and legal scholars
uncertain about the enforceability of electronic agreements. The uncertainty has had a chilling effect, even at computer-astute
places like General Electric Co.'s GE Information Services unit and
the TPN Register Co. - GE's joint venture with Thomas Publishing Co. The companies solicit suppliers and hammer out details of procurement
contracts for GE's affiliates and other companies via the Internet.
But when it comes time to execute a contract, the companies resort to
pen and paper. ``I think ideally you'd love to be 100 percent electronic,'' said
Orville A. Bailey, vice president of marketing and business
development at TPN, because adding paperwork is not as efficient.
But, he said, his company is more ``comfortable'' having signed paper
contracts on hand. Bailey is not alone. E. Allan Farnsworth, a leading contract law professor at Columbia
University, said that when a contract was substantial and complex,
``I think the safe thing to do is to do it in the old-fashioned
way.'' The reason in part, according to Raymond T. Nimmer, professor of law
at the Houston Law Center, is the Statute of Frauds - which traces
its origins to early English law - requiring that many contracts be
written and signed by the parties against whom enforcement is sought.
While some states, including California, Minnesota, Texas, Utah and
Washington, have recently passed laws permitting digital signatures
to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, Professor Nimmer said, most states
- including New York - have not. In addition to the Statute of Frauds
problem, electronic contracts can give rise to questions of
authenticity and authority of the parties involved, Nimmer said. Even in states with no laws addressing enforceability of electronic
contracts, many legal experts are confident such agreements will hold
up in court. Arthur Rosett, a law professor at the University of
California, Los Angeles, said, ``It's hard for me to imagine a court
finding that an electronic communication that has been proven does
not satisfy the Statute.'' Moreover, some computer experts contend, electronic contracts are in
some respects better than paper ones.  Vincent I. Polley, general
counsel at Omnes Co., a network services concern, said software
should render electronic contracts tamper- and forgery-proof. But others were guarded in their endorsement of electronic contracts.
``The judicial system - the lawyers, judges and juries - are not
populated by hackers,'' said Jonathan J. Lerner, a partner at
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. ``If you're talking about a
very large and important contract, you need to have your head
examined not to secure the best form of agreement'' - which, in his
view, remains a paper contract. The stakes can be high, said Constance E. Bagley, senior lecturer in
law and management at the Stanford Business School and a practicing
lawyer. She cited the example of a software sale over the Internet,
in which the software had a bug that damaged the purchaser's entire
data base. If the contract were deemed unenforceable because it did not satisfy
a requirement that it be a signed writing, or because the
authenticity or authority of the person assenting to the terms came
into question, then the merchant could theoretically be liable for
all of the purchaser's losses, she said, because limitations on
liability included in the contract would be ineffective. Lawmakers are scrambling to fill the gap between technology and the
law. Leaders of this effort include Professor Boss of Temple
University and Professor Nimmer of the Houston Law Center, who are
helping revise the Uniform Commercial Code to deal with electronic
contracts. Under the proposed revision of the code, which governs
transactions in all 50 states, electronic agreements formed with
active consent, such as digital signatures or clicking on spaces
indicating acceptance of terms, generally would be enforceable. But the UCC revision, which individual state legislatures could
adopt, adapt or ignore at their own choosing, is at least a year away
from completion. It could run into further delays because of criticism aimed not at
the technical provisions concerning enforceability of electronic
contracts, but at changes and additions within the draft to sales and
licensing laws. For example, some intellectual property experts worry
the revision would allow publishers to write contracts that encroach
upon rights in the public domain, said Pamela Samuelson, professor of
information management and law at the University of California,
Berkeley. And the American Automobile Manufacturers Association
contends that the revision's proposed changes in rules for the sale
of goods would increase seller liability and the cost of doing
business. In addition to the UCC revision, the National Conference of
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws is planning to propose state laws
legitimizing electronic contracts not covered by the UCC. And the
U.N. Commission on International Trade Law, on which Boss served as
the American delegate and expert adviser, is completing a model law
on electronic commerce that is expected to be presented to individual
countries for incorporation in their domestic laws. Washington, so far, appears to be eager for the law to catch up with
the technology. Several agencies, including the Commerce Department,
have collaborated on a paper favoring the adaption of domestic and
global laws to support electronic contracts. As lawmakers struggle to get rules in place, some businesses are not
waiting. For these businesses, ``The cost of the gamble is cheaper
than the cost of the contract,'' said Patricia B. Fry, a law
professor at the University of North Dakota and the chairwoman of the
national commissioners conference electronic contract effort. Ford Motor Co. uses ``purely electronic contracts'' with suppliers,
according to James Ziety, counsel at Ford. Ziety said he knew of no
trouble with Ford's electronic agreements. Any problems, he said,
were ``virtually always worked out at the business level.'' Meanwhile, Boss said, the gap in the law invited a major court
decision. ``When the case comes along,'' she said, `` when it hits,
it may well be the big one.'' As for Deak, the uncertainties about electronic contracts are not
holding him back from making deals online.  ``Every night when I say
my prayers,'' he said, ``I thank the Lord for the Internet.''

I've been digging through the PGP 5.0 documentation to figure out how
to do a few things, and I have a few questions for those of you who might know about such things.
I'm using the freeware version at the moment, though if I can show the
benefit and ease of use of the software, my department at work will be

To quote the documentation...
"PGP offers a selection of different secret-key algorithms to encrypt
the actual message. By secret key algorithm, we mean a conventional,
symmetric, block cipher that uses the same key to both encrypt and
decrypt. The three symmetric block ciphers offered by PGP are CAST,
Triple-DES, and IDEA."
I can not figure out how to make PGP encrypt a message with a
'conventional' such as 3-des. Is this only available in the commercial
version? When invoking PGP against a file, as opposed to the clipboard, is
there a way to tell it to ascii-armor the resulting encrypted file by
The documentation leaves much to be desired along these lines. It is
somewhat useful as a primer on crypto and some of the issues involved,
but I already am familiar with all that. I just want to know how to
use the program to make it do what I want. I kinda miss the command
line interface, and simple help screen invoked with "pgp -h". I
realize I could still make use of pgp 2.x, but I need something
windows-simple for the folx at work.
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

The wonderful thing about this though is that it is just too damn easy to move a web site offshore to a location more friendly to commerce, so they will ultimately fail. The bad part about this is that there are few, if any restraining forces on government action in most places. Therefore, it is likely that any attempts to regulate internet commerce will be enforced for far longer than any person with a brain would continue to do to.

NEW YORK -- Breaking News Network of Fort Lee, N.J., denied
prosecutors' allegations that it illegally intercepted sensitive

charges. Breaking News said it uses a network of volunteers to listen to
police scanners and other public radio traffic. The company then
distributes information, such as the locations of fire and police
activity, to news organizations paying for the service. "The company is absolutely outraged at how it has been treated and
believes that what is really involved here is an
effort to intimidate and embarrass a news-gathering organization,"
Mr. Rowan said. According to a complaint unsealed this week, Breaking News and people
affiliated with the company allegedly used tracking software and a
"cloned" police pager to illegally tap into alphanumeric messages
sent to high-ranking police, fire-department and city officials.

1. In a democracy, 51% of the people can vote to enslave the other 49%
2. In a democracy, you can't have property rights because 51% can capriciously decide to confiscate anyone's property.
3. A pure democracy is true mob rule - a mob has no concience, or bounds to it's tyranny. Look into the history of ancient Athens.

You miss the point entirely. This is =not= supposed to be a democracy. That is why we have a constitution (theoretically a set of restrictions upon the powers of government), and bill of rights. There have been, that is why the point is not moot. The point is, we are becoming one, with the advent of instant polling and politicians and citizens who obviously can't read as simple a document as the constitution.

THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ARGUMENT FOR MANDATORY
KEY ESCROW ENCRYPTION: THE "DANK" CASE
by Andrew Grosso
A few comments on some statements the author makes that stuck me as I read this person has obviously no familiarity with the tenuous nature of most "commerce clause" claims. if they can claim that a potato farmer, growing tomatoes locally, selling and transporting his harvest locally still falls under the 'commerce clause' rationale for some legislation, they can pretty well call anything 'interstate commerce'.
I'll treat this next bit incrementally. not any more. all the cops or whoever has to do is claim  a 'good faith' exemption for the search, and, Bingo! it is suddenly admissable. There are several recent Supreme Court cases on this.
This, likewise has been narrowed in recent years by the court. One thing to remember if you are being spoken to by some jack-booted thug working for some level of the state, is to say =nothing= to them. They can sit there and question you at length, and until you think to demand a lawyer, you are screwed everything up to that point is admissable. There have even been recent erosions of what constitutes asking for a lawyer.
Ever since the O.J. trial, there have been calls to eliminate this. I wouldn't be suprised to see it within a decade.
This is absolutely laughable. You can be tried in state, federal and civil court for the same crime. This is all perfectly fine as faer as the courts are concerned. Likewise, there are so many laws now on the books, that if they can't get a conviction on one charge, there is a pretty good chance there is another charge they can make.
This is no longer true.
I laugh at that. true enough. the problem is, that there is no defense for it. it is a basic binary decision. either you can speak freely or not.

Though I hate the conmcept of key escrow, it actually makes sense for corporations to be able to have access to internal documents. Why they think having key escrow in place will stop people from being able to use other encryption as well is beyond me. I guess it's the same (stupid) mentality of the feds. They don't think anyone would be smart enough to use the escrowed encryption a a wrapper for the non-escrowed encryption.

mark was heard to whisper to several hundred people:
most This isn't quite as bad as the current setup with pgp5.5. We've set up
something almost like this within my department. We have a shared key for
the department, and private keys individually. I'm pretty leery of the
concept of a shared group key, but for certain types of messages, it is not
too terrible a solution. Of course, you have problems when someone leaves
the group, as you now have to change the master key for the group. I'd
actually prefer to be able to use conventional crypto for when we need to
distribute new passwords amongst my group, as it is easier to deal with ftmp
(for the group where i work anyway) without the difficulties of having to
revoke/reissue the dept key.
One thing that I think PGP needs more than anything else, is to make it easy
to build lists of keys to encrypt to. Version 4.5 has this feature, which is
why I'm using it. I would hope that 5.5 does, and will also let the user
create whatever type of keys he wants and use conventional crypto as well.
I'm expecting a copy here soon, so will get to play with it then.
I can't say I really like version 5.0 much.

kinda like the stuff I've had in my email program for ages. Nothing formal

Some interesting hits for "data embedding" on IBM's patent server page...
ISSUED: Sep. 23, 1997
FILED:  Oct. 21, 1994
Snip of abstract:  Additional data useful for the management of copies of a document for an image forming apparatus is embeddedin a hard copy of the document. The additional data is embedded in an inherent image of a document as pixels arranged in a prescribed format, and,
preferably, the size of the pixels is such as to not be easily recognized with the naked eye. ISSUED: Aug. 19, 1997
FILED:  Feb. 23, 1995
ABSTRACT:   A method of embedding auxiliary information into a set of host data, such as a photograph, television signal, facsimile transmission, or identification card. All such host data contain intrinsic noise, allowing pixels in the host data which are nearly identical and which have values differing by less than the noise value to be manipulated and replaced with auxiliary data. As the embedding method does not change the elemental values of the host data, the auxiliary data do not noticeably affect the appearance or interpretation of the host data. By a substantially reverse process, the embedded auxiliary data can be retrieved easily by an authorized user. The patent office needs a fucking clue server. Hmmm... wonder if I can get a
patent for one?

Though it will probably be changed soon, this could be a useful number to Oops! President's fax line made public
Copyright (C) 1997 Nando.net
Copyright (C) 1997 The Associated Press WASHINGTON (November 20, 1997 5:06 p.m. EST) -- The House committee investigating campaign fund raising briefly posted
President Clinton's personal fax number on the Internet this week, despite a request that it keep the number private.
White House press secretary Mike McCurry called the incident "a procedural lapse" on the part of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee chaired by Rep. Dan Burton, A committee spokesman said the public posting of the number of the president's fax machine was a quickly corrected and "inadvertent" mistake with no malicious intent.
McCurry said the White House is concerned because the fax machine, located just outside the Oval Office, serves as the president's sounding board, a personal link to hundreds of friends and acquaintances around the country.
"It would be a source of concern to the White House because that's a very valuable way in which the president maintains contact with an incredibly diverse group of Americans," McCurry said.
"It's not the first time that they've had some procedural lapses," McCurry said of the Burton committee.
The incident was reported Thursday by Roll Call, a newspaper that covers Congress.
The committee obtained the fax number when it was mentioned by former Clinton political consultant Dick Morris during a deposition last August.
The committee failed to black it out when it posted the Morris deposition on the Internet Tuesday.
Will Dwyer, a spokesman for the committee said the number was available to the public for no more than an hour.
He contended committee lawyers had never definitively promised Morris to keep it private although Morris did ask that it and his private phone numbers not be disclosed. "I don't think we have breached any agreement," Dwyer said.
Dwyer took issue with McCurry's assertion that the incident was one of a series of lapses on the committee's part. "He's making a mountain out of a molehill," he said. "As soon as we discovered it we corrected it. There was no intent for anything malicious to occur here."

@_subject: ECC Challenge 
Hmmm... A cracking challenge that doesn't appear to be snake oil...
As reported in PCweek Found at Certicom Packs more than a Decade of Research into its ECC Challenge Certicom has created and launched an ECC Challenge, giving
cryptographers and mathematicians who are new to the Elliptic Curve
Cryptosystem (ECC) the benefit of hands-on experience with elliptic curve
algebra. The Certicom ECC Challenge is the result of research and
development into ECC by Certicom's cryptographic experts. The Certicom ECC Challenge, posted at Certicom's web site, is expected to
draw participation from cryptographers and mathematicians around the
world, giving them the opportunity to work with elementary elliptic curve
algebraic problems and test their own knowledge against what are
internationally recognized to be difficult and infeasible problems. "We believe the Certicom ECC Challenge is a great way for those
cryptographers and mathematicians who are looking to expand their
knowledge of elliptic curve algebra to form a strong appreciation for the
security of ECC," said Dr. Scott A. Vanstone, Certicom's Chief
Cryptographer. Participants in the Certicom ECC Challenge must try to compute an ECC
private key at a particular key size, given the corresponding ECC public key and a set of parameters. As a lead-up to the Challenge, Certicom has
included a set of Exercise problems, the simplest of which should be solved
in a matter of hours following the Challenge's launch. Prizes will be awarded for the first correct answer to each of the Exercises. Mathematical software to facilitate cryptography-related computations and a copy of the Handbook of Applied Cryptography will be awarded for the 79 and 89-bit Exercises, and US$5,000 for the 97-bit Exercises. Prizes have also been set for both Level I and II Challenge problems,
including those which are considered infeasible based on current knowledge
and available computing capabilities. The highest prize is US$100,000 to
find a 359-bit ECC private key. The elliptic curves for the Level II
Challenges meet the stringent security requirements imposed by forthcoming
ANSI banking standards, specifically ANSI X9.62 and X9.63. Visit Certicom's web site for ongoing status report of the ECC Challenge.                    Go to the Certicom ECC Challenge                    For more information about ECC, check out Certicom's ECC Tutorials and

The Javascript page at infohiway has posted a javascript implementation of simple encryption for the web.
This would be interesting if it had a real crypto algorithm in it like ===from their page===
Welcome to the ISN‰ Web Developer's Cut-N-Paste JavaScript,
Perl and Plug-ins Toolbox!
Featuring more than 189 FREE JavaScripts you can simply paste
into your HTML! Plus we have some Cut-N-Paste Perl and CSS
scattered around the site, too!
Cut-N-Paste JavaScript Home / Encryption Scheme
 This little script is really easy to use. Just paste in your message and
you get back your encrypted message... relatively quickly. So long as the recipient has the same JavaScript app as you do, decryption will work.
 The sample on this page is of a 4-Bit encryption open architecture scheme using only JavaScript. Although designed primarily for encryption of shorty emails, the same notion could be used to protect confidential dealer price lists, etc. on your public pages.
 Encryption is not just a matter of "jumbling letters". Any amateur cryptographer has a whole lot more tricks than that up his sleeve.
 First, our little sample programs permit you to use a key letter, a key word or a key phrase of your own devising. What length? You decide. Since the length is unknown, we've created a first problem for anyone attempting to decrypt it.
 Secondly, they are ultimately recursive. Meaning that you can recursively encrypt encrypted materials as many times as you wish. Only you and the recipient know how many times. Another problem for the "great decryptor".
 Finally, you can really be sneaky about the key phrases you use. For example, you might agree that the key phrase will be the seventh line on page 13 of Catcher in the Rye. (Seventh month, thirteenth day) Or you might grab the 13th line on a page at a specific URL for this month. Or the lead headline from the ABC News Home Page for today.
 If you download this little script to your hard drive, even if the boss finds it, it does him/her absolutely no good whatsoever in decrypting your email, because the key phrases are absolutely necessary to the decryption of encrypted messages.
