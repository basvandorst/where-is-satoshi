I hope I'm not made regret jumping the gun again.

Mr. Strassman allegedly sent the quoted letter to Winn Schwartaus'
"infowar" mailing list, and it was then posted by persons unknown to
the sci.crypt usenet group. Identity on the internet being the fluid
thing it is, I apologize in advance if he never sent this letter, or
if it has been modified before it reached me.
The quoted letter attempts to minimize the importance of Ian
Goldberg's recent bruteforce decryption of export-strength RC5
In my opinon, as described below, Mr. Strassman's arguments are
without merit when applied to the situation the RSA challenges are
intended to model - the security of encrypted Internet protocols. As
such, I feel that his letter may lull some people into an unjustified
and dangerous sense of security.
What's the target, and who is doing the encrypting?  These "clues"
_are_ available to adversaries engaged in industrial and economic
espionage; a important part of a covert infowar.
It's certainly true that "info-terrorists or info-criminals" will not
be so easy to tap, but the absence of these 'clues' is a red
herring. They will be secure because they will use good encryption,
which is not what US firms can export today.
The challenges are realistic models of encrypted Internet protocols,
for example IPSEC with ESP data encryption. As such, they accurately
display the vulnerability of data on the Internet to espionage.
Clues  and  are absolutely reasonable - in an open standard, it is
absolutely normal to know the cipher being used, it's mode, and the
length of the key. See the SSL specification, or IPSEC's RFCs.
To those who are unfamiliar with Internet protocols, this would appear
to give the cryptanalyst an unrealistic head-start. This is not the
case.  Most Internet protocols have highly stereotyped packet headers;
for example, _every_ normal return packet from a web server starts out
with the string "HTTP/1.0" (servers using something other than version
1.0 are rare as hen's teeth at the moment).  When you consider that
such a packet may contain a firm's confidential earnings predictions
or trade secrets (hopefully encrypted), the economic importance of
such data is clear.
Similar stereotyped headers exist for many other protocols, such as
NNTP and SMTP. As such, a known-plaintext attack, as modeled by
RSADSI's symmetric key challange, is quite realistic.
Even if a full known plaintext for the first block is unavailable, a
knowlegable cryptanalyst can usually make some very reasonable
assumptions which will greatly speed his or her task. (I'm assuming
DES here - which has a 64 bit block, but the argument extends easily
to other block sizes). For example, if we know that the data contains
only printable ASCII characters (true for the headers of most Internet
protocols), then for a 64 bit block, there are 8 bits which we _know_
will be zero in the decrypted block. This lets us dispose of 255 out
of every 256 incorrect trial decryptions immediately, and we will have
to perform more extensive tests on less then 0.4% of candidate keys.
Similar intelligent guesses can be made about the headers of other
protocols, for example IPSEC-secured IPv6 packet headers in tunneling
Some people have noted that the challenges include the IV, or
'initialization vector' used in CBC (cipher-block-chaining) modes of
encryption, and argue that this would not be available to an
adversary. Once again, this assertion falls when examined in the light
of actual usage.
The purpose of an IV is to make dictionary and replay attacks more
difficult. It is not intended to prevent brute force attacks, and so
is _normally_ included in the clear in communications protocols (for
example, see RFC 1827 for it's clear transmission in IPSEC). If it
is not included, it is effectively part of the keying material, and
thus adds it's bits to the strength of the key. As such, its value
would have to be transmitted and protected as carefully as the rest of
the key.  As I have shown above, Mr. Strassman's optimism is misplaced in the
case of actual, fielded use of encryption on the Internet. It may
apply to some classified systems, but they don't use exportable
cryptography anyway. A covert inforwar against commercial and private
targets is _quite_ plausible.
What exactly is he hinting at here?
Of course he can't. 40 bits of RC4 encryption (as used in the
exportable version of Netscape) was brute-forced not once, but three
separate times in the fall of 1995, the fastest effort taking about 28
hours. Today it could be done much more quickly, as Ian demonstrated
with RC5 (an algorithm of similar complexity).
I disagree. The RSA challenges accurately model the use of encryption
on the unclassified Internet. Ian's decryption of 40-bit RC5 is of
considerable importance in demonstrating the insecurity of American
citizens caused by Administration efforts to compromise exportable
In my opinon, Mr. Strassman's assertions as to the strength of
exportable encryption are too dangerous to be left unchallenged.

@_subject: DDJ Crypto CD has arrived! 
Well, it's finally here.
Frankly, I'm a little disapointed with the presentation. It's based
around a program called Hyper Reader, from Intergaid. This seems a bit
out of date - the copyright runs from 1987-1994. While this may have
been driven by a desire to support Win 3.1 without extra software, an
HTML based approach would have been my preference.
I've encountered a few minor bugs in the few minutes I've played with
it; not all of the buttons work properly, and the color maps go to hell
when the program's window is not selected.
While the book data is stored in some proprietary format with an *.hw4
extension, chapters can be easily exported to flat text files. They
can also be exported in WP format, but diagrams don't seem to come
out (at least when I export them to MS Word) - figures seem to be scanned bitmaps from the books.
Here's the copyright data, which lists the books present:
For those wondering: Applied Cryptography includes the source code
appendix. I have not checked if it has the 5th printing corrections.

@_subject: RSA DES Challenge starting! 
I'd like to remind people that Monday, July 13th,
1998, RSA Data Security is releasing the challenge
data for the next RSA DES Challenge (the brute force
solution of a DES encrypted message).
For more information on this challenge, please see
 The prize stands at 10,000 USD
for the first solution found within 10 days.
If wish to attempt the challenge by yourself, I
reccomend that you look at Svend Mikkelsen's
Bryddes (
which is by far the fastest Intel implementation
I know of - considerably better than my own
If you're interested in a joint effort, you could
do worse than look at  This
group won the RC5-56 and January 1998 DES challenges,
and are currently working on RC5-64. Their clients
will automatically switch over to DES Monday
morning. It looks like they should attain around
86 billion keys/second, which will exhaust the
keyspace in under 10 days. However, only a fraction
of the prize money goes to the person who finds
the key.
Cracking DES in these challenges serves a higher
purpose than winning a prize or gaining bragging
Single DES (the kind used in this challenge) is the
strongest general purpose encryption which Americans
are currently permitted to send overseas without
special and rarely granted waivers.
As a result, the US government is turning over the
world market in high quality cryptography to
non-US firms, with a cost of billions of dollars a
year to the US economy, thousands of American jobs,
and increased crime and terrorism resulting from the
poor security this policy promotes.
Demonstrating how vulnerable US 'export quality'
encryption actually is creates pressure to remove
those restrictions entirely.
I regard this as a desirable goal.
