Nonsense.  It was supposed to be a discussion of crypto and other technologies in support of privacy.  The founders, Hughes,
Gilmore, May and Daniel were focusing on that goal.  The list
structure was anarchistic (and still is to those who understand
the concept of anarco-capitalism).  Obviously Gilmore is not
wedded to the idea of letting every fool use his bandwidth.  In
personal discussions as recently as yesterday, Hughes had no
problem in supporting some mechanism to promote civility on the
list.  I don't think anything May has written would suggest he
would have a problem with keeping things polite.  His only argument seems to be over methodology.  He thinks filtering is
the answer; I don't.  Reasonable minds may differ.  Hugh Daniel
has been instrumental in providing technical help with regard to
moderation.  Finally, the fact that the vast majority of list
members have not seen fit to "vote with their feet" should suggest how most really feel about moderation.  (By the way, if
you don't like moderation, you would hate Eric Hughes' favored Again, nonsense.  The moderation experiment (moderation, not
censorship) has been in effect for all of ONE WEEK.  Where does Paul get this hysterical "recent months" stuff?  Paul's argument is the essence of literal conservativism,  "but I don't things to change!"  Without change, though, there can be no progress.  Moderation is a one-month experiment.  There is no
intellectual dishonesty in saying, "let's try something else for
a while."
"Unspoken but ever present class structure"?  I wonder how Paul
was able to divine this?  Certainly it is unspoken, but that, of course, it because it does not exist anywhere but in Paul's
fertile imagination.
Great!  I thought that hadn't been determined yet.  What a  S a n d y

Eric, would like to require a deposit ($20 was the example he
gave) from subscriber/posters.  Non-subscribers would not be allowed to post.  Subscribers who voluntarily left the list, would get their deposit back.  Subscribers who flamed twice (every dog gets one bite) would be kicked off the list and their deposit would be forfeited (or perhaps turned over to the flame  S a n d y

I'm curious about the gratuitous use of the word "forcibly" by
Paul.  Does this mean Gilmore took a fire axe to the computer or
something?  Dimitri was unsubscribed.  It was done more or less
against his will.  ("More or less" because he in effect said to
John, "bet you can't stop me.")  What does "forcibly" add to this
discussion besides melodrama?  No force was required.  John had
the right and ability to pull the plug on Dimitri.  "No animals
were harmed in the making of this film."  "Force," my ass.
There are various definitions of "censorship" and various flavors
of anarchism.  I'm a market anarchist, Paul is not.  Paul claims
to believe that any form of moderation is censorship.  I think
that enforcing standards of decorum on a private, voluntary list
are not censorship.  Reasonable minds may differ.  I acknowledge that Paul's interpretations are not without some justification.
(I just think they are incorrect in the instant case.)  Paul, on
the other hand, seems to be a True Believer.  He brooks no view
other than his own.  (Curiously hypocritical under the Paul's sophistry is showing.  Nation-states are entities that
exercise a monopoly on the use of force (real force, Paul)
within (and often without) their boundries.  Mail lists are far
more like private homes, businesses or clubs.  When you are a
guest there, you are subject to their rules of behavior.
Several substantive examples, please.  True, nothing Bill Stewart
has posted has been sent to CP-Flames.  One guess why.  Numerous
posts by Dimitri have been posted to CP-Moderated, but many more
have not made the cut.  There are much more obvious reasons for
this than Paul's biased analysis.

Interestingly, the saying, "to let the cat out of the bag" is
related to the saying, "to buy a pig in a poke."  A poke is a
sack or bag.  In times past, street peddlers would sell a mark a young pig.  The pig was supposedly put into a poke, but in fact,
a bag with a cat in it was substituted.  By the time the mark
figured out his mistake by "letting the cat out of the bag," the
peddler was long gone.  The lesson the mark learned was "Don't
buy a pig in a poke."
The better metaphor for crypto is that the genie is out of the
bottle.  Alternatively, that the crypto bell cannot be unrung.

We do not disagree except neither of the metaphors I gave suggest
anything about the "putting in the bag" part of the deal.  In no
way does either suggest a right, power or even ability of anyone
to limit any freedom.  They are mute on the subject.  Their sole
meaning is that one CAN'T undo what is already done.  In the
instant case, that means the wide-spread availability of strong

If I wasn't clear, I'm sorry.  I think the quality of content
and the degree of civility have improved.  My extreme example was
the increase in polite, on-topic posts from Dimitri, but are others.  That's the sort of improvement to which I was referring.

That's why we call it a test.  I have no software.  Everything
I'm doing is manual.  Whatever John has done is probably jerry
rigged just for the test.  If list members opt for moderation, more effort will be put into
the moderation infrastructure.  The idea right now is to see how
well a first aproximation of moderation works.  If it seems like
a step in the right direction, great.  If everyone thinks it
sucks, well that's great too.
