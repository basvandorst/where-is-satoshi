2. The iName customer may have signed up for one of iName's free offers
   and then not validated their forwarding address.
3  The address may simply be typed incorrectly.  Please check that you
   typed the email address correctly.

   rendering their old iName email address inactive.
2. The iName customer may have signed up for one of iName's free offers
   and then not validated their forwarding address.
3  The address may simply be typed incorrectly.  Please check that you
   typed the email address correctly.
iName provides email users with a permanent, personalized and secure email
address that is independent of how one accesses the Internet.  iName acts

This is an automatic message to inform you that your email was not
forwarded through iName's server.
The iName email address that you tried to send mail to may not be active.
Reasons for the failed delivery attempt could include:
1. The iName customer has selected a new personalized iName email address
   rendering their old iName email address inactive.
2. The iName customer may have signed up for one of iName's free offers
   and then not validated their forwarding address.
3  The address may simply be typed incorrectly.  Please check that you
   typed the email address correctly.
iName provides email users with a permanent, personalized and secure email
address that is independent of how one accesses the Internet.  iName acts
as a global forwarding service.  All email sent to a permanent iName address
is automatically forwarded to a user specified destination email address.
