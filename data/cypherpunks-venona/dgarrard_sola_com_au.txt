I think we ought to just throw TIM MAY out of the list. let's EXCOMMUNICATE HIM. its becoming increasingly clear
that he is the source of all our problems. I mean, isn't
it obvious that our progress has stalled? who has written
any code within the last 3 days? if we got rid of him,
it would be EVOLUTION IN ACTION. More drivel deleted.
     Personal attacks in this mailing list is highly inappropriate but doing through a Remailer is downright pathetic.
