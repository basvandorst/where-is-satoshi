@_subject: Crypto Software Review Wanted 
There's a ton of only semi-organized stuff out there.
I would like structured info... more that just a filename, without having
to install it myself, etc...
Review of the packages would be real nice.
PS: I heard CFS requires having NFS installed (ick!) and someone mentioned
this opens you up to "portmapper assisted attacks"... I've avoided NFS
and RPC until now so I don't know... does this have any credibility?
Will I have to install a firewall to protect NFS just so I can use CFS to
encrypt on disk? :)
CC me in the replies please, since I'm not on the list...
 although I might get on coderpunks if the volume is small.
Hmm, I just noticed the cypherpunks-ratings list, I wonder if this is what
I'm looking for...  too bad it doesn't have a description or an info file.

There's a thin line between an email message and its signature.

@_subject: Re: The Nature of the Cypherpunks List 
In message <199609241913.PAA19989 you write: here here.  400 messages in less than a week, with no digest, no moderated
equivalent and no explanation for the "-ratings" list?
who has time for that?  i'm interested in crypto but
i have a hard time believing any serious researcher could sift through all
the messages and still have time left to eat & breathe, much less code!
goodbye (again!) cypherpunks list!  i had hoped things had changed in
the last 2+ years but i guess not.  as far as i'm concerned if it
generates > 10 emails a day i'd have to justify reading it to my
employers, or cut back on my coding at home, neither of which is
likely to happen :)
i am interested in any alternatives, cypherpunks readers...
other mailing lists that are serious about crypto, security, etc.
wasn't there talk at one time of a list for coders?  can anyone
remind me of what happened to it or where it exists now?
