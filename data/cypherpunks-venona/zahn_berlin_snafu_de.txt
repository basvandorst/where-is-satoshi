I suggest ignoring Reply-To: etc and requiring a return address inside
the signed region of the mail, otherwise someone could intercept the mail
(suppressing the original) and resend it from his account and the results
would get sent to the interceptor.
 Another idea would be to extract the return address from the PGP userid
which signed the script.

How about claiming that you used a OTP and then revealing the key?
Or should I say a key?

I have put together a package to check Cantsin 2 Signatures.
Prerequisites are:
perl Version 5
libgmp Version 2.*
a C compiler
precompiled binaries are provided for Linux-ELF (libc-5.*), if you have
that you don't need libgmp.

currently /dev/random for generation of keys and signatures

Well, you need libgmp (GNU LGPL License) and Perl (Artistic License).
I consider this not more then a proof of concept, for example the
private key is not encrypted, the key management is done by hand,
there is no web of trust or something similar,
and normally one would write the hole thing completely in C.

I have       D054C9E4ABD5CEE0C5A4343E5D1E2EF91C00048A
which looks the same. I'm currently making some improvements, in
particular in the speed of the key generation. I'm open to other
suggestions to improve this package.

There are activities underway. The German knights of public and national
security have their own agenda: production, distribution and use of strong
cryptography shall require key escrow in the software. There was already
one failed trial to launch a law to require this. Now the activities
run in interior circles, nobody knows what comes next.

The protocols where suggested by the anonymous person 'Monty Cantsin'.
There were 3 relevant emails regarding that protocol to the
mailing list cypherpunks For anyone who has missed
those emails I have put it at The protocol (currently) only specifies a format for a digital
signature of documents or parts of documents. The algorithms used
are SHA1 and ElGamal. There is currently no encryption specified.
In contrast PGP 2.x used RSA and MD5 and has encryption with IDEA,
PGP 5.x has another collection of algorithms.
Compared to PGP, that exists as commercial software,
my package is an experimental proof of concept, so it is
not 'superior'.

@_subject: Cantsin package 
I have updated my package for Cantsin No. 2 signatures to the new version 0.3.
New things:
-  faster key generation
-  a mechanism to allow the storage of the private key encrypted with
   an external encryption program. Example included.
-  it is possible to sign only a part of a document.
