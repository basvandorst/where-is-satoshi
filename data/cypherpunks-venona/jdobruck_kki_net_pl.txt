Does anyone know where I could find Fortify for Netscape Communicator

I've heard these two are going to come out one day soon.
What I'm interested in is what's so new in it that it's being called
version 6.0... Thanks in advance.
And my second message is about my archive. The reason why it hadn't
been updated to something worthwhile is the fact that i need to
spell-check the archives i download. There are tons of errors in them.
It's just too bad that people don't spell check their own documents on the

@_subject: Crypto Books/Archive 
I wish to inquire where I can buy books about cryptography. If these
bookstores are located somewhere in Europe then it would be a little
more convenient for me, if not, then that's not too much of a problem.
Thanks in advance.
I'm working on my archive, although the reason why there hasn't been
anything new for a while is because I'm doing preparation courses in
math and physics for the Warsaw University of Technology. However,
I'll have something new on there soon. The reason why there isn't
anything great at the moment is because I'm a lousy worker, so I can't
be rushed.
I have this idea bout making a cryptography program that will encrypt
pictures. I know that you can do this with PGP, but I mean it in a
little different way. What I want to do is this: You have opened a
picture in, ACDSee for example, and you want some of the picture only
for a certain person. So you chose that part of the picture, encrypt
it, and send it to the person you want. What do you guys think?
Sincerely yours,

The idea is like with the plug-in for Pegasus Mail. You don't need to
go to PGP encrypt the message and then send it. You can do that right
through the Pegasus Mail. Same idea with my program. Would make it a
little faster instead of encrypting your piece of picture in many
steps you can do it with one push of a button.
Another thing. You're right. You can cut the piece of picture you want
to encrypt and then encrypt that little piece. But if you want to send
the whole image, and make that little piece invisible to everyone else
but the sender... this is what I'm getting at. If someone still
doesn't understand, I'll try again later.
Sincerely yours,

The thing is, the receiver can decode it because he knows his
passphrase so only he will see the image and noone else. It's like
like PGP only with pictures, not plaintext. But if you guys think the
idea is stupid, I'll scrach it.

@_subject: Program: 'Speak Feely' for "secure comminucations"... 
I've come across this program on the net which claims to give "secure
communications"... could any of you folks comment of this program? bitmap 	transfer. Encryption for secure communications. Might be slow
with modem 	connections. The text below is part of the text on the homepage...
Speak Freely for Windows
                         Release 6.1
Speak Freely is a Windows application that allows you to talk
(actually send voice, not typed characters) over a network. If your
network connection isn't fast enough to support real-time voice data,
four forms of compression may allow you, assuming your computer is
fast enough, to converse nonetheless. To enable secure communications,
encryption with DES, IDEA, and/or a key file is available. If PGP is
installed on the user's machine, it can be invoked automatically to
exchange IDEA session keys for a given conversation. Speak Freely for
Windows is compatible with Speak Freely for Unix, and users of the two
programs can intercommunicate. Users can find one another by
communicating with a "Look Who's Listening" phone book server. You can
designate a bitmap file to be sent to users who connect so they can
see who they're talking to. Speak Freely supports Internet RTP
protocol, allowing it to communicate with other Internet voice
programs which use that protocol; in addition, Speak Freely can also
communicate with programs which support the VAT (Visual Audio Tool)

You're lucky, I was in a good mood today... you got help... but there

So learn mr. aol user and stop asking this stupid question. There are

This camel and banana thing has gone WAY out of cypherpunk lane. This sounds like
material for a 'how-to-feed-a-camel-over-long-exposure-to-desert-heat newsgroup'
which, surpassingly, just might exist... not? :- ) prove me wrong :- )
About a year ago there was this program about cars on the Discovery Channel...
forgot it's detail... anyway, this weird prof. and a bunch of his student wanted to
prove that you can make cars with anything... so they got banana peals, cut them
into slices and made forms out of them. This did not create the essence of a car,
the engine, however they did make the chassis into a very nice bright yellow :- )
... OUT OF BANANA PEALS <:- )
So next time you eat breakfast, eat a camel ! .. WAIT... I mean a banana ! :- )
