@_subject: Re: Calling other code in Java applications and applets 
What with the concern of hacked or modified clients, I would think that
trusting a java applet someone put on their page would be rather difficult.
How could the user know that you weren't really sending their cleartext back
to you?
I have not seen a mixmaster client for the PC/Win95 yet.  Did I just miss it? Remember that we can't really know if their applet is secure or just a
trojan horse.
