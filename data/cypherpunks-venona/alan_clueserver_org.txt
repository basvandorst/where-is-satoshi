I can see where they want to make a profit, but the licence makes the
software virtually undistributable by normal shareware channels.  ship the libraries on a CD of shareware products for which a price is charged.
If I were to create a program using the libraries and upload them to Simtel
or one of the other big archives, it could not be distributed on a Simtel
CD-ROM that someone was charging money for.  (Ignoring the usual export
I see this as a big problem.

I know that, you know that, but do the lawyers know that?
Shareware and freeware share the same distribution channels, so it is a
problem for freeware until the licence gets upgraded.
I know that.
I just find the current versions on the licence agreement to be not well
thought out.  I expect similar problems to be found in the shareware licence.
By version 2.x of the license agreement, I expect it to be something that
will not make problems for freeware/shareware developers.
[Note: I am not claiming consipracy or illwill by PGP in this matter.  This
stuff just reads like the lawyers had not quite enough understanding of the
issues when they wrote this.  Could be worse, Borland has had some pretty
unworkable license restrictions.  And I won't even get into Microsoft...]

Freeware and shareware often share the same distribution channel.  It kind
of puts a crimp in distribution if you cannot upload to any archive that
might wind up on a cd-rom.  (Furthermore, uploads to those archives are not
always under the control of the author.)
Hopefully they will go back and update the freeware license agreement as well.

Some of the site that cookie bomb do so out of ignorance.  Old versions of

the option soon after.  The option was originally called "Mod_cookies" and
people left it figuring that if they disabled it, they could not use
cookies.  Actually it is a method for tracking usage patterns within a

cookie data from user tracking in any worthwhile manner. Any company that
relies on cookies to hold onto membership information is foolish. (Cookie

gets washed away with the tide.)  Cookies are not needed for storefronts.
There are better ways to accomplish the same thing. (There are CGI
