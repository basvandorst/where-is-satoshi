"There are no sounds, only numbers.
 Turning round and round inside my brain.
 Turning into words which are stolen from the wind,
 And imprisoned in a digital refrain."
   "Analog was King when Elvis crooned.
    Sound had soul and beauty, dissonance and charm.
    But war has been declared upon the soul (and imperfection),
    And the Digital Revolution is the newest call to arms.
"Digital Revolution" from "The Tables Have Turned (@ 33 rpm)"
