@_subject: Injunction Against Spammers 
Today Concentric Network Corp. won an injunction [15] against Cyber Pro-
motions, Inc. -- the outfit against which AOL lost a court fight to keep
its subscribers free of email spam -- see TBTF for 9/8/96 [16]. Cyber
Promotions, it seems, was forging a Concentric Network return address in
their spams, so thousands of outraged Netizens bombarded the ISP daily
with demands that Concentric stop supporting an activity that is, in fact,
forbidden by their terms of service and of which Concentric was entirely
innocent. The wording of the promise that Cyber Promotions was compelled
to sign forbids them specifically from thus abusing Concentric in the
future. It seems to me that the spammer will be free to choose another
ISP "goat," or to forge a nonexistent return address on their future
spams, without penalty. This timely news just arrived on Glen McCready's
 "0xdeadbeef" mailing list.

What else do I need for an internet server?
HP Vectra Towers 2 each 486 cyrex chips 50 meg processor  Need high
speed hard drives.  These are the Tall Towers that have multiple drives, these are server towers.
I think I have a router Hub.  And a couple LAN cards.
That's all I have.  But I just got them, and I want to use them.  I assume I
will be using some kind of UNIX software.

Dale, Thanks for your reply.  Really I'm not sure about UNIX, I was just
guessing.  What I really need is a B.O.M (bill of materials).  What other
'hardware' will I need to round up in order to get this server up and running.

Human Gus-peter, I think you should be very careful.  They throw everything you write into the trash.  That could mean they are watching you. That could be VERY bad for you.  We will see where this message goes.

Tim, what have you done to deserve such treatment?  What agenda is it that
makes it seem as if the machine hosting this mailing list will be in the wrong
hands?  Like the shadow government?
Sorry they are giving you the Dr. V. treatment!

Yeah... what about making microchips, LSD or diamonds - all of which
have very high value/mass ratios.  Or bio warfare agents - maybe in
cryogenic state to be warmed up when finished.  What about more
complicated lifeforms - like people.  It would be hard to figure out
what to use for currancy, though - in Star Trek, Latinum is assumed,
according to one book, to be dependent for its properties on a huge
number of molecular legs resting against each other rather like the
fins of an artichoke steamer - can't be replicated because unless the
molecule is complete each leg creates an unequal force on its
neighbors and they flip into a non-latinum position.   Not that there wouldn't be positive elements - medicine would be very
cheap.  In fact, a pound - or maybe a mole - of anything with value
would cost no more than its component elements, plus labor.  What
about little self- 'replicating' robots that go into a landfill and
produce an army of themselves, turning excess elements into something
useful.  BTW, could living things be replicated or would the structure be too
complex?  Intelligence supposebly depends on electrons moving in tiny
protein quantom channels in the brain in a completely unprodictable
way, telpathy is the electrons becoming quantom linked.  That could be
hard to replicate.
