It does not work.
     Correct. A number of people have run tests on the strips (no, I didn't
archive the articles, they were about 5-6 months back) and they are just
what they appear to be, inert plastic strips put in there to make faking
money more difficult. Many paper currencies arounf the world use plastic or
metal foil strips in their money to make the bills more difficult to
reproduce. I am familiar with the Israeli shekel (NIS) that has had foil
strips in it for years...
     The main problem with detecting the strips is that it is faily trivial
to have a detector that will determine if some strips have gone through, but
having one that detects with any accuracy would be difficult to manufacture
and still keep paper currency proportionately cheap. I suppose
mini-transmitters in the 400 or so $10,000 bills might not be too far
fetched, but it seems ridiculous.
Assuming many falsehoods is scary... Now if only I could finish my mind
reading aparatus...

Sorry for taking this seriously, but it has been considered and rejected...
It is just inert plastic with metalic letters so that they are opaque to
light while the plastic is translucent and provides a backdrop...
Can someone snip this thread already?

Also one very bad reason NOT to do this. Posting to a newsgroup would remove
any ECPA protection that your e-mail may have had. Sure, it isn't much, but
at least proven interception could discourage traffic analysis. Proving it
is left as an exercise for the student.

Does anyone know any more details on the crypto chip listed in the HTML
 It seems that this is a hardware PGP (uses RSA to

in December... or is this just some very interesting vapor-ware?

The ECPA offers two levels of protection to e-mail, transmitted e-mail
and stored e-mail. The some mail on Illuminati (Steve Jackson's BBS) had
been sent but had not been read by the intended recipients. The the first
trial found that the there had been a violation of the ECPA with regard to
the section on stored mail, but not on transmitted mail. It narrowly defined
the transmitted section to include only interception contemporaneous with
transmission with the e-mail. Sine the mail had been sitting around on the
hard disk, the court refused to call it interception.
     If anyone really cannot find a copy of the ECPA I can go search for my
ASCII edition, but right now I only have a hard copy lying around somewhere
on this desk.

This worked quite well last time, also considering that many of the

I'll be the one wearing the black motorcycle jacket with a painting of

@_subject: Re: CP lawyers? Pro Bono work... 
Speaking as the Pro Bono Legal Advocates vice-chair of my school and as
a future attorney, this might be possible, but consider the costs involved
besides the relatively minor ones of attorney's fees. I can't really give a
reliable estimate (Phil Karn, any idea how much of you appeal was spent on
hourly fees as opposed to expenses?).      Although attorneys on this list may be generally sympathetic the
expenses of federal lawsuits can be quite discouraging as pro bono
oppurtunities. Personally I find most pro bono volunteers will work in local
settings for indigent clients (Domestic Violence cases, AIDS related legal
issues, guardianship of minors, juvenile defendants, small claims mediation,
and other situations where expenses are low).
     Any attorneys out there want to take this up? Black Unicorn? Others?
Should that be the topic of my next handbook?

I whole heartedly agree! Thank you Alex for pointing out the real issue. ObPlug: (I am currently writing a handbook on what intellectual property law
can be used for when developing crypto systems, either to make a profit or
to keep them free from commercial entanglement.)
     Tomorrow (San Diego Cypherpunks meet at Hops) I was planning on asking
Phil Karn what Qualcomm was planning with Eudora as far as any PGP hooks, or
if we need to to get of our rear-ends and design a mail application that
will implement PGP for all the SLIP users on Windoze & MacN'trash systems.
     Sure there are those of us who can use LINUX and various scripts to
bring PGP into our mailers, but a well built app that would get PGP to the
lay people who want their privacy is needed. So, Cypherpunks write code.
     o Get off our collective asses and write something for:
          SLIP / PPP in windoze, mac, ( & warp?)
     o Make it free, widely available, and either stand alone, or compatible           with Eudora.
     o Collectively demand that Qualcomm do something or else...
     o See if there are any software companies willing to take up the challenge.
     o Meanwhile, see what works for people... Create a contest for who has
the best system for ELM, PINE, EUDORA, etc...
     o What about windoze scripting? PCTools for windoze scripting? Other
     I am willing to help, but I'm in the middle of Law school finals so any
help will be delayed...

Depends on whether RSA has a patent in that country... I know of no
countries besides the U.S.A. that have a patent on RSA. Using exact code may
also violate copyright...that is a tougher matter to prove...but copyright
treaties allow some level of international protection...use with care.
It was a trade secret. It is no longer...Copyright issues still are still a
problem, but ask an attorney in your country if you are going to use it in a
commercial program.

Although the concept of "text viruses" seems a bit far fetched to some
people, there these lovely toys known as ANSI bombs. Essentially they work
in a similar method to the some techniques used in the sendmail bug, but
they are MS-DOS specific, they will use embedded ANSI codes to run programs
as the files is viewed... anyone know what will happen if deltree /XXX
(where XXX represents an unpublished string of characters) is run from the
root directory of a DOS hard disk? Its gone, quickly. Sure the files can be
undeleted, but undeleting a whole disk is tricky business...
Maybe Good Times is a hoax, but ANSI bombs exist and using a DOS ANSI text
viewer will surely be a foolish thing to do on any downloaded text file...
If anyone feels the need for proof I collected a few a while back, but
really don't see the need to post them...heh heh.

PS: Please no comments about superiority of MACs or LINUX boxs because they
are immune to ANSI boms...that ought to be clear enough...

@_subject: EFF letter to Church of Scientology (FWD) 
*****POST FREELY AS APPROPRIATE*****
An Open Letter to the Church of Scientology (CoS) and the Net
from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
Over the past several days, the Electronic Frontier Foundation
has received several reports from system administrators and
others about threats of lawsuits they have received from
attorneys for the Church of Scientology and the closely
associated Religious Technology Center and Bridge Publications,
Inc.  These threats apparently are designed to convince sysadmins
to discontinue the carriage of certain newsgroups that involve
discussions of the Church of Scientology and its teachings, solely
on the ground that some of the messages sent through these
newsgroups allegedly involve infringements of CoS copyrights or
other intellectual property rights.
EFF has also received a letter from CoS stating that it would
not use the threat of lawsuits against sysadmins if there were
any other way to deal with allegedly wrongful messages.
EFF believes there is a better way to deal with allegations of
wrongful messages -- and that using the threat of litigation to
shut down entire newsgroups, or to persuade sysadmins who
have not originated any allegedly wrongful messages to shut down
newsgroups, is itself highly inappropriate.
Electronic communications are in their infancy, and most of the
providers are not big corporations with substantial funds to
spend on expensive litigation, but rather small operators who
cannot afford protracted litigation, even if they are in the
right.  The mere threat of a lawsuit could result in some sysadmins
refusing to carry all sorts of contentious newsgroups simply because
they could not afford to put on a case to show that they should not
be held responsible for another party's alleged wrong.
Rather than attempting through threats of lawsuits to induce
innocent sysadmins to censor speech, Church members are
encouraged to participate in Usenet discussions to make their views
known and refute erroneous posts -- in other words, to answer
allegedly wrongful postings with more speech.  As U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Louis Brandeis articulated in 1927: "If there be time to
expose through discussion the falsehood and the fallacies, to avert
the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is
more speech, not enforced silence."  If CoS claims that a
copyright violation or other wrong not remediable by speech has
been perpetrated by a particular person, then it should confine
its legal threats to that person -- not direct them at an innocent
sysadmin who did no more than forward a message, and certainly
not at the innocent participants of a newsgroup seeking to exchange
views through the newsgroup channel. Even if CoS cannot determine
the identity of the person perpetrating an alleged wrong against it,
that provides no excuse for cutting off the free flow of information
over the net.
Events like these show us how important it is to search for new
paradigms for handling disputes that arise from time to time.
We think the better way to handle this dispute would be to
submit the claims and counterclaims to arbitration or
mediation, perhaps in a proceeding conducted over the net
among the parties to the newsgroup discussion. EFF offers its
services to help find an appropriate mediator or arbitrator
who would be available online for this purpose. Any party to
this dispute that refused to participate in such a forum would,
of course, have to explain why it had done so if a case were
brought in a more traditional court.
Meanwhile, we urge CoS to leave the innocent sysadmins out of
their fight.  We urge CoS not to take actions designed to cut off
the free flow of information through the net.  Where there are
legitimate disputes about particular messages or the wrongful
actions of particular individuals, those can and should be
addressed -- perhaps most efficiently through the new
communications medium itself.
