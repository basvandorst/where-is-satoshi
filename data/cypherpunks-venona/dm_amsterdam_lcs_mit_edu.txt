Well, I'm not much of an elisp hacker so I resorted to using perl, but

First, can someone tell me if the latest version of blowfish (the one
in Applied Crypto 2nd edition) is available online somewhere?  I
looked at a bunch of crypto ftp servers and could only find an older
version of blowfish that did not have the blf_ctx structure allowing
multiple keys to be active at a time.
More importantly, however, on a 120 MHz Pentium, the old blowfish
(compiled with gcc version 2.7.2 optimization -O6) seems to take about
12.6 microseconds for 1 M encryptions and decryptions, which works out
to about 95 cycles per byte.  This is significantly more than the 26
cycles/byte number cited in Applied Crypto 2nd edition.
Can anyone suggest what I might do to speed this up?
Failing that, can anyone suggest other secure, preferably unpatented,
shared-key encryption algorithms that could encrypt at ethernet speeds
(1 MByte/sec) without using most of the CPU on a fast Pentium or

The problem with RC4 is that it works in OFB only.  If I need data
integrity in the face of known plaintext, I will need to compute a MAC
in paralell with the encryption which could significantly slow things
down.  With a block cypher in CFB, I can just re-encrypt the last
block of data.
That said, OFB has the advantage that I can overlap computation of the
RC4 stream with I/O, which might be a win for me.  Are there any MACs
significantly faster than say ~50 cycles per byte?

@_subject: RSAREF dos not give you access to RSA 
RSAREF does not give you RSA.  Do not think that you can write and
distribute free software that uses RSA encryption in the US just
because of the existence of RSAREF.  If you don't believe me, let me
tell you a little story.
The RSAREF license strictly requires that you only use the documented
RSAREF interface, which does not include direct access to the RSA
functions.  The relevant portion of the RSAREF license is section 2d:
          Prior permission from RSA in writing is required for any
          modifications that access the Program through ways other
          than the published Program interface or for modifications to
          the Program interface. (See the "What is it? RSAREF Supports
          the Following Algorithms" and "What You Can (and Cannot) Do
          With RSAREF," paragraph 4, all incorporated herein by
          reference, for details.) RSA will grant all reasonable
          requests for permission to make such modifications.
PGP got a such "prior permission" to call functions outside of the
RSAREF interface.  However, that is only because PGP was such a
high-profile case with a lot of MIT people behind it.
On July 10, 1995, Tatu Ylonen sent mail to RSA attempting to get
permission for US users to use RSAREF with ssh.  Since ssh requires
double encryption, something impossible to achieve through the
published RSAREF interface, it called two of the functions PGP also
uses, namely RSAPublicEncrypt and RSAPrivateDecrypt.
It took RSA until September to respond to the original request, at
which point they told Tatu they could only consider such a request
coming from a US citizen.  On Monday, September 11, 1995, I therefore
sent in my own request to be able to use ssh with RSAREF.
After many many messages, I got bounced around from RSA to Consensys
Corp. and back to RSA.  I was never able to get permission to use ssh
with RSAREF.  For a while I was a bit optimistic about the situation.
For example on February 16, 1996, I was told the permission letter
"should be sent out next week."  However, it's been a couple of months
since then and still no letter.
Even if I get the letter tomorrow, however, it still will have been 9
months since the first request to RSA went in.  The RSA folks seemed
particularly concerned that the permission letter might be used for
more than one particular program, or even more than one particular
version of a ssh if major changes occured.  In one letter, for
instance, someone from RSA said:
   We'd like to avoid granting open-ended permission like: SSH
   provides for all of your security needs and the RSA calls are used
   to provide any kind of security service deemed useful now and in
   the future.  Not that we wouldn't grant permission to new
   function/feature requests, rather we'd like to incentivize you to
   keep us posted as ssh grows.
That means if I got a permission letter tomorrow, but in several
months ssh was modified to use a better MAC, I might have to wait
another 9 months to use the latest version ssh (which might no longer
be the latest version by that point).
Even if you think 9 months is an acceptible amount of time to wait to
release an application you have written, consider this:  First of all,
I don't have the permission letter yet.  I might get it tomorrow, I
might get it in a year, or I might not get it before the RSA patent
expires.  Second of all, the only reason I have gotten as far as I did
with this permission letter is because someone from MIT helped get me
in touch with someone at RSAREF who would actually read my mail.
Before that, I was told by RSA that I could only deal with Consensys
Corp., and Consensys Corp. told me they could not grant me the kind of
permission letter I was requesting, so that I was basically stuck
(well, in theory Jonathan Zamick from Consensys Corp. could still be
working on getting permission from RSA, but I haven't heard back from
him since Nov 9, [except when he wanted to license IDEA to me, which
ssh fortunately already has permission to use]).
Conclusion:  You can't use the RSA algorithm in free software.  The
RSAREF interface is too restrictive, and when RSA says in the license
that "RSA will grant all reasonable requests for permission to make
such modifications" to the interface, it is either an outright lie, or
something that only happens after so much delay that they might as
well not give you such permission.
P.S.  You can help fight software patents!  Join the league for
programming freedom (

@_subject: THE ONLY WAY TO UNSUBSCRIBE 
As many of you know, the secret to getting off the cypherpunks mailing
list is closely guarded and only even understood by a few, highly
skilled cryptographers.  The problem is that if there were any simple
way of sending a simple mail message saying, "hey get me off this
list", then the NSA could simply forge this message for every member
of the list thereby suppressing all the subversive information
discussed on this mailing list.
An alternative would be to require a cryptographically signed
unsubscribe message.  However, even then we would run the risk of the
NSA cracking our private keys with their superior technology.
Moreover, President Clinton has made it illegal to use cyptography in
many countries other than the United States, so that foreigners would
still not be able to unsubscribe.
This leaves only one solution, and has resulted in the cypherpunks
philosophy:  "Once a cypherpunk, always a cypherpunk."  Anyone who
joins the cypherpunk mailing list must remain on the mailing list for
the rest of his existence.  Unbeatable, you may think.  How can I get
off the mailing list if there is no way to unsubscribe?
Well, I will now reveal the secret of leaving the cypherpunks mailing.
Before reading further, however, I must ask that you become a US
citizen or permanent resident if you are not one already.  You must
also agree not to discuss this information with any foreigners, as
providing any kind of assistance to non-US cryptographers is a federal
crime for American cicizens.
Now, though you must remain a cypherpunk for the rest of your
existence, you will be removed from the mailing list when you cease to
exist.  The trick to unsubscribing is therefore to convince the
cypherpunks majordomo and the NSA that you non longer exist, when in
fact you really do.  Though for years cypherpunks have thought this
ment cancelling one's E-mail account, there is, in fact, a second,
secret escape route from cypherpunks:  exit code 67.
That's right, if your local mailer exits with code 67 on receipt of
each cypherpunks mail message, you will suddenly seem to have
disappeared.  The cypherpunks will simply believe that the NSA finally
got to you, and that nothing more can be done to communicate with you.
All the while, though, you can continue exchanging private E-mail on
topics other than cryptography.
How then, do you use exit code 67?  First, you must create a file
called "cypherpunks-filter" which contains the following:
setenv PATH /bin:/usr/bin
set username=`id | sed -e 's/).*//' -e 's/.*(//'`
set homedir=~$username
set tmpfile=$homedir/.mailtmp.$$
cat > $tmpfile
if ( { egrep -q '^Sender: owner-cypherpunks \
(rm -f $tmpfile; exec /bin/mail -d $username) < $tmpfile
Then, create a file called ".forward" in your home directory.  In this
file, place the following line:
You must replace '/path/to/cypherpunks-filter' with the actual path of
the the file you just created, and you must replace `yourlogname' with
your actual log name.  After you have done this, you will stop
receivingn all cypherpunks E-mail.  Eventually, you will even be
removed from the mailing list.  Be aware, however, that this procedure
is illegal in Georgia unless you first legally change your name to
"Mailler Daemon".

@_subject: Re: anonymous mailing lists 
If you are thinking of revamping the mixmaster protocol, I have a
couple of suggestions/requests.  One basic philosophy motivating all
of these ideas is that I would like to avoid requiring any
"centralized control" or consensus about exactly what remailers should
exist.  This can be achieved by pushing a lot of configuration
parameters into the anonymous messages, where the sender has control
over them
First, D-H (or RSA with short-lived keys) is an extremely good idea.
Long-lived encryption keys (like the current mixmaster secret keys)
should not be used for secrecy.  However, it would also be good if you
could avoid any man-in-the middle weaknesses.  Specifically, with
simple D-H, an active attack could be used to record all anonymous
messages from A to B, and weeks later if B is compromised the messages
could then be decrypted.
Thus, when sending from remailer A to remailer B, B's identity must be
proven with B's public key (either through RSA encrypting A's half of
the D-H secret key and a challenge with B's key, or by having B sign
his half of the D-H secret and a nonce).  Moreover, since not every
remailer will be known to every other, and since people may want to
set up and test new remailers for a while before announcing them to
the world, a strong cryptographic hash or MAC of B's public key should
be embedded in the remailed-message itself.  Thus, A can query B for
its public key and verify the public key, then use this public key to
know it is talking to the real "next hop".
It would also be nice to avoid having every message go through every
remailer unless the sender actually want's it to.  In particular, a
larger remailer network should not have to translate into more traffic
for all the remailers, as it would be nice to have as large a network
as possible.  Thus, if, for instance, remailer A sends messages out
every half hour, and A wants to send messages to B, C, and D--why not
send the three useful messages to B, C, and D all in the same round,
and just send garbage to all the other remailers.  Of course, messages
should be allowed to have as many next-hops as necessary, so that if
you don't want A to know that a message's next hop is B, you can ask
it to send the same message to C, F, and G as well as to B.  That way,
A won't know the real next hop.
Now the next question is, when sending garbage to all the other
remailers, should "all the other remailers" be defined by A or by the
anonymous message itself.  Here, A should definitely have some list of
remailers it knows about.  However, maybe at each hop a message should
be able to supply 6-byte (IP address/port number) addresses of other
remailers to which garbage should be send.  If there appears to be a
remailer at the address supplied, and that remailer is not already
known to A, perhaps the new remailer should automatically be added to
the list of garbage recipients (and then automatically deleted if it
stops responding for 24 hours).
In the event that A has a real backlog of messages for a particular
destination B, it might make sense for A to hand some of those
messages off to other remailers instead of just feeding them garbage.
That way, even when one remailer is receiving a lot of mail it won't
be immediately clear to it's operator which the preceeding hop is.
Given all these features, of course, it would be necessary to have
variable-length next-hop-descriptors instead of the fixed size and
number currently in mixmaster.  Is there some reason this can't be
done?  The total actual length of the 3-DES encrypted portion of the
mixmaster message shouldn't be available to any but the last hop.
Thus, is there something wrong with padding the message (or even just
the 10K header portion of the message if you want to keep the message
in two parts) with garbage to be 3-DES decrypted into more garbage at
the next hop?  Of course the padding should be done in such a way that
the final hop does not know how much space the remailing headers
originally took up, but this shouldn't be too hard (for instance the
padding could go between the headers and the message data).
Finally, another very useful feature would be some support for
improved response blocks.  Right now aliases like alpha.c2.org don't
offer very much security because they have to go through Type-1
remailers.  However, one could imagine mixmaster extensions to allow
it to work for replies as well as anonymous messages.  Imagine a nym
server with just a 10K mixmaster header as a response block.  The
server would pad a received message to 10K, prepend the 10K mixmaster
header, and send off the message.  At each hop of the way, the message
would get "decrypted" with some 3-DES key (and possibly a weird IV).
However, couldn't the recipient then just "encrypt" the message to
recover the plaintext?  Of course, this might undesireably weaken the
replay prevention, but there's got to be a good solution for response
blocks somewhere near what we currently have for mixmaster.
