no instead things screech to a halt when the 1000th user gets on each client machine
when she was prohibited from that service because of her actions it is.
no they slack off whenever they get a chance
...or when 5 trillion hackers descend on the machine and eat it alive
...or when "their network" is broken.
if a user on netcom violates the AUP, their account would be terminated...if those were the terms of the AUP.
It just so happens the AUP of winternet allows for this situation.
its a bit far fetched to call HIS reaction a tantrum.... If anyone's screaming for mommy its whats-her-name....
big is better i guess....
Big providers like Netcom don't have a 'community' to speak of.
uhmm, sounds like the deal was cancelled because she didn't deliver.,..not out of spite
HAhahaha...if you had any idea what you were talking about, you would realize you are totally off base.
Winternet is HARDLY a 'bbs'.  Its a regional internet service....much as netcom was before they flooded every city with dialups.
Any professional knows better than to read private mail...and if this is so...then they aren't worthy of having a site to run
as for PGP, this is an individual thing....I'm sure mike has no such objections...i know here at MindVox we don't...in fact, we installed it for the users
Who owns netcom's machines?
Once again, you speaketh from your ass....
Netcom is an abomination.....it is the only one of its kind (not counting delphi etc, since they were conceived under differnent systems)
Netcom is a Winternet which has grown out of control.
They suck network services off others (irc as one example) and don't take responsibilty for the HUGE number of idiots on their service who maliciously hack anything they can reach....its totally without personality...AND....its slower than molasses...the management is out of touch with the users and they are so overloaded with trouble reports, they don't know what to do with them.
Yes....join them carol
join them....

This has got to be one of the largest loads of crap I've seen tossed on this list in the year and a half i've lurked on it.
I'd love to see a response to this...please!
oh...btw...i don't have ANY connection to winternet, other than knowing MANY satisfied customers, and having heard alot about them, as a sysadmin for a site in much the same situation.

I'd hardly call taking a day off being an asshole.  Is he supposed to staff the thing 24 hours a day 7 days a week?
No...its a small operation, that cannot be expected.
and you like the fact that you have NO idea who's running the place.
and why is this?  there is no support for this statement...
hardly...after the fit this woman threw.  CC'ing his private mail and interactions with her to COMPLETELY unrelated places .... such as
cypherpunks, nicholas negreponte of all people, wired, etc, etc, etc
as i understand the situation, the main contention here is that she was trying to sell space on her web pages.....on winternet's machines....without winternet's permission.
How would netcom react to such a situation (oh thats right....you're not allowed to have web pages)
How about a similar situation, such as you selling the time you don't use on your account to a friend and pocketing the money
no...instead, submit to the authority of 100 or so ANONYMOUS arrogant incompetent fools
he's not posting this all over the place....Carol had a fit and he chose to respond.  I'm afraid the baby here is Carol

hahah....netcom can make up anything they want to.
You do of course, read these agreements before you get on...don't you...
Here's a simple solution...don't get on a systems who's AUP you disagree You assertion that simply because a company is not netcom's size, that its unprofessional and incompetent is rediculous.
right....because Netcom is FILLED with assholes....those that crosspost to 10 groups are overlooked
so...AOL is better than netcom?
at least they have an irc server.
and ALL of netcom's problems are related to the systems and network....
they didn't plan their expansion correctly....and as a result...are feeling it now.
and Netcom has many of the undesirable characteristics found in big systems like Prodigy and Compuserve...
if you honestly find this attractive.....well, enjoy
well of course.....Netcom will read your mail too if you are accused of hacking.  The fact is....the chances of someone reading your mail on Netcom are about 100 times higher than on a smaller system....simply becuase the place is so overridden with root wielding hackers who have nothing better to do than torment others....
well......once again.....shop before you buy.  You can't make such blanket assertations, because they simply aren't true. Netcom is also the LEADING source of trouble for the rest of the network because of the way they handle their user population.  They can't keep up with all their problems.  This seems to translate to you as - "They respect me and don't bother me"  THe fact is....they don't even know who the hell you are.  And....being a matter of scale, as several pointed out...
netcom is about 100 times the size of winternet....(approximation)...
thus...lets multiply everything by 100, profits, users, problems, etc, etc
If one of their user's posted (10x100) 1000 MAKE.MONEY.FAST posts to 1000 different groups.....you can bet that person wouldn't have their account the next day.
this is THEIR network.....
there is ANOTHER network out there....its called...the Internet.
I've had MANY users at my site connecting from netcom, and insisting that our T1 is overloaded because of the chunky responses they are getting...
well, guess what.  As soon as they tried from somewhere else....their problems dissapeared.
They contribute very little to the Internet .... and that which they do is overshadowed by the harm many of their more immature users cause
its not?  then your opinion doesn't count...right?
i mean...you're just a satisfied user
If you call netcom usable...you've obviously NEVER tried another ISP...or had several VERY bad experiences with the few you've tried.  I urge you to give the whole situation another look.

Oh yes....and how can we forget...
for all its superiority....it seems to have dropped SLIP/PPP because that made them have to deal with the customers too much.
Makes you feel all loved eh?
