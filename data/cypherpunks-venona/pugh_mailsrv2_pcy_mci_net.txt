ConnectSoft Licensing Agreement with RSA Data Security Includes
Revolutionary S/ MIME Technology; ConnectSoft's early BELLEVUE, WASH. (July 24) BUSINESS WIRE -July 24, 1995--ConnectSoft,
Inc.,  provider of the most powerful, easy-to-use interfaces to
digital  communication and commerce, announced today it has licensed
a new  interoperable security technology from RSA that will provide
ConnectSoft  customers with added privacy and security to their daily
communications.  The agreement gives ConnectSoft products compliancy
with the S/MIME  specification (Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extension) that ensures a customer's e-mail is read only by the
designated recipient -- regardless of the e-mail platform they are
using.  The new security features will be included in the newest
versions of ConnectSoft's E-Mail Connection(tm) and Internet
Connection(tm) products that will be released this fall.  "In today's networked world, security is a growing concern as we rely
on  e-mail for more of our day-to-day communications,"  said Bob
Dickinson,  ConnectSoft's vice president and general manager,
Consumer Online Products & Services division.  "Our arrangement with
RSA provides encryption and authentication technologies giving our
customers the most protected and secure communication available
today."  The S/MIME specification is based on the popular Internet MIME
standard and allows a customer's S/MIME message to be composed and
encrypted on one vendor's system and be successfully received and
decrypted on a different one. The specification also uses the
intervendor PKCS (Public Key Cryptography Standards), the most widely
implemented commercial standard for public-key cryptography in North
America.  Global Security Standard

from _computer_digest_ (raleigh,nc edition) august 1995...
"In the past, the office (U.S. Patent Office) has contended that
because software is a mathematical process, it can only be
- -protected- and not -patented- by copyright law. However, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has ruled in several recent
cases that inventors deserve patents because the programming was
integral to the machine."
The office announced in March that it would propose new rules for
embedded software patents and published them in the June 2 Federal
Spokesman Richard Maulsby said the agency hopes to have final
quidelines in place by September.
Under law, the office issues patents for 'machines', 'articles of
manufacture' and 'processes'. The proposed rules tell patent
examiners how to determine whether software proposed for patenting
meets the criteria.
Under the proposed rules: 'A computer or other programmable
apparatus whose actions are directed by a computer program or other
form of software is a statutory "machine". A computer-readable memory
that can be used to direct a computer to function in a particular
manner when used by the computer is a statutory "article of
manufacture". A series of specific operational steps to be performed
on or with the aid of a computer is a statutory "process."
What isn't patentable? According to the rules: 'A compilation or
arrangement of data independent of any physical element,' meaning no
hardware. The guidelines are available on the patent office's World Wide Web
server at The patent office is accepting comments on the proposed guidelines
through July 31.

would this give any more ammunition to companies like rsa in
protecting their algorythm?

hello all,
while this message has zero cypherpunks content, i'm posting this

someone on this list can help me with my question.
a friend of mine who has an mcimail account is having trouble getting

@_subject: Re: Certificates/Anonymity/Policy/True Names 
an excellent point, and one that i'd not seriously considered until i saw your post. given today's legal climate, assuring the confidentiality of a ca's key would be pretty expensive. i suppose burning cd-roms with all transactions would help to document all transactions, but would not be definitive as far as the signatures go. any document signed with the key would really have to be considered valid if the signature itself is to really mean anything in a legal sense. if one were to allege that a signature is not valid, even though it checked out cryptologically, how could one defend against a charge that the secret key had been compromised. you cannot prove a negative. obviously, ianal, but i would think it would be reasonably easy to convince at least one jury member that there is a reasonable dought that the key had been compromised.
then again, it might be similar to a claim that a signature has been i think there could be a danger of allowing the confidence in a given piece of crypto to unduly influence a jury of a document's authenticity when the key _had_ been compromised. the 'gee wiz' factor could be fairly significant among juries. given statements like 'you could take all the computers on the planet and let them crunch on it for a billion years would be needed', a jury might miss issues of security.
fwiw, my 2 cents...

where can i find a good 'how to' faq on anonymous remailers?
i've looked around and found several documents that tell me what they are, but no good information on how to use the various remailers.
pointers are appreciated.

@_subject: sled corp 
Hello C-Punks,
I recently found a company called "sled corp" at
they are a white pages directory service (who i have absolutely no
relationship with) that claims they will sign someone's pgp key for
$20/year. to verify the identity of the person's key they are
signing, they require either 1) a mailed or faxed copy of a driver's
license,  2) mailed or faxed copy of a passport,   or 3) a preprinted
personal check (which cleared).
i'm not sure how much i would trust this type of signature anyway, as
all 3 of the above methods of identification can be easily forged,
but i'd appreciate some comments by some of the folks out there that
have considered the concept of key signatures. if anyone has had any dealings with this company, i would appreciate
any comments on them. feel free to contact me privately if you'd like at either
