@_author: magic money for example 
@_subject: re: PGP DLL, library 
I see some people thinking about encryption API's and related code.  I
suggest interested parties take a look at Pr0duct Cypher's PGP Tools
and RSAREF.
PGP Tools is based on PGP 2.3a, and provides a library of routines
upon which applications can be built (magic money for example).
RSAREF provides 15 or 18 routines which provide various services, such
as encryption, key generation, digital signatures, hashes, etc.  I'm
not saying necessarily use RSAREF due to licensing restrictions, but
take a look at it's overall design.
And there is other code available at ripem.msu.edu for example.
I know there is a tendency/desire to support PGP, but I think anybody
who wants to create a PGP DLL/library version will have to be part of
the PGP development team, since PGP is a fairly fast moving target.  I
don't know what is in store for PGP's future, but future enhancements
will probably include PEM support (or whatever standard becomes
popular), a new format for keyrings, an API, larger key sizes, etc.  I mean, by the time you "update" the current version of PGP to a
DLL/library version, a new version will appear which may be very
I guess what I'm saying is either roll your own encryption, join the
PGP development team, or wait patiently.

@_author: Caller ID Block 
@_subject: C.I.D. 
How can we defeat caller I.D.?  It used to be that if you wanted
to have anonymous e-mail, you could sign on to a BBS.  But I am
scared by the new modems that are equipped to log caller I.D.
The general public believes that if they want to remain anonymous,
they can defeat caller ID by dialling *67 before making a call,
that way making sure that their number is not revealed.  Ha!
This is true, but not the full truth ... because Big Brother
still has the number:
The calling number is sent between switches always, regardless
of whether or not *67 (Caller ID Block) is dialed. It just
sends along a privacy indicator if you dial *67, and then the
final switch in the path will send a "P" instead of the calling
number to the Caller ID box.
(But it will still store the actual number - *69 will work
whether or not the caller dialed *67).
What the final switch along the path does with the calling
number depends on how the switch is configured.  If you are not
paying for Caller ID service, the switch is configured so that
it will not transmit the Caller ID data.
Before this, if you wanted to make sure a system didn't trace
you back, you could call through a few diverters, PABXs, etc.
However, today with Caller ID, your call information will be
routed from diverter to PABX to system instead of stopping at
the first diverter.
The effect call forwarding has on the various services is
interesting... Say I have my home telephone forwarded to
Lunatic Labs, and it has Caller ID.  If you call me, the call
will forward to Lunatic Labs, and its Caller ID box will show
YOUR number, not mine (since your line is the actual one making
the call).  Does this get you thinking?
Anybody knows of a way to *really* defeat caller I.D.?
Or, absent that, a more appropriate mailing list than this for
such questions?

@_author: or "header" if you will 
@_subject: C.I.D. 
Multiple recipients of list :
Some Happy Fool asked how we could defeat caller ID 'cause the *67
still sends along the calling number between switches (it just doesn't
display it, but that is not the same as it not being available to the
bad guys  -  *69 will still work, regardless).
The discussion should probably be taken off the list, so please direct
replies to me personally (or better: let us know of a more appropriate
forum.  I am disappointed in alt.hackers and 2600 really sucks, are
there better places to go with this kind of stuff? Anybody?)
To Happy Fool et al:
I've got the specs for a program to use with your modem to generate
what'll resemble a full CID.  So with the computer set up to dial, even
standard voice calls too and faxes, too, can be equipped with a fake
field (or "header" if you will), displaying a homemade caller ID.
Since it uses the exact same structure as the real caller ID, no telco
along the entire system will ever doubt it.  I can send the full
specifications if you are seriously interested in doing the code in
full or in part.  Sorry, I can't implement it myself (lack of skills).
If we get the thing running, it will dial any number and send the
counterfeit header along with the call, making the telco switch believe
it is dealing with a forwarded call.
The beauty of it all is that this way, it will not insert its own header
(it only does so when no previous CID header is detected).
This is not just for use on the U-S Signaling System 7, because SS7 is
now an international standard. Many countries are far more computerized
than the U-S. In parts of Europe, some 95% of all areas now have digital
Caller ID is probably the most anticipated and feared part of these
systems.  This service, only available in digital areas, keeps track of
the last 10 numbers that called and the time and date they did so.
Example:  Let's say you are in a digital area.
You call a friend with a caller ID device (costing ~=$40).
Between the first and second ring, they have your number.
It's as easy as that.
He doesn't even have to pick up the phone.
Even busy calls or calls where no-one is home are registered!
WARNING: When whole nations are digitalized, ANY system you call pegs you
within 5 seconds of your call.
What about diverters, call forwarders and stuff like that?
They won't work. To cheat them, you need to produce fake headers.
So if the software is not already written, let's write it.  Volunteers?

@_author: "header" 
@_subject: CID 
[ I agree that we should take the discussion off this list.  Both the
original poster and myself asked for suggestions of more appropriate
forums to continue in.  I also asked for replies to be directed to me
personally, not to list.  This is only in reply to Vail's public msg.]
As I understand the whole SS-7/ANI/CID thing, CO generates the field
("header") only when a previous one is not already present in the call.
I'm no phrexpert, but we've done some experiments nevertheless and
emperically our evidence supports this:  So I will paraphrase part
of an original post to make it clear.  It deals with call diverters (not
Telco's "Call forwarding", but the private box you put on one line at
home to personally direct all incoming calls to a second outgoing line.
You can also steer calls through a PBX, of course, but lets keep
the example simple. Nevertheless the end result is the same.)
Pay attention now.  Let's say that in my home I have a call diverter
installed on my incoming line (line 1), forwarding - via my outcoming
line (2) - all calls to Lunatic Labs.  At the Labs, we have ANI.  You
call my home, but I am not there.  Because of the diverter, your call
gets steered to the Labs instead.  Sit up straight now, this is where to
fun part begins.  WHICH OF THESE 2 NUMBERS ARE DISPLAYED AS CALLER ID?
Your home phone number? (Who made the original call) Or that of my line
no.2 at home? (Who actually made the last call, the one to the Labs).
Surprise: Your number!  (Original poster already said so, of course).
Before SS7, you would route your call through a handful of diverters and
stuff if you didn't want to be traced.  Now there is no escaping.  The
first and original Caller ID follows the call no matter how you twist it
around.  If it is not there, it will be created.  If it is there, your
CO simply acts as a substation, it seems, not inserting any ID. Again, I
am no expert, but you can experiment with this yourself and you will get
the same result.  Interesting.
*67 is merely a privacy indicator (a "P" prefix) suppressing the
DISPLAYING of the information, but it is still there and still stored in
the computer. Because if the system is serious enough about getting
your number, it can pick the call information straight up off layer 4 o
the call - in other words, your call information, instead of stopping
stone cold at the diverter, was passed from node to node up to your
intended system. Cute, eh? .. but only if you're BEHIND the trigger.
So, what can be done about it?  Like I said yesterday, if you have the
skills, we can perhaps but some code together that will let us build our
own counterfeit CID fields.
I have my doubts that a standard modem will be up to the task, this is
just a hunch, maybe we will have to put some special electronics
together to get the right tones.  But I am a babe in the woods, just
commenting on a paper I got thrown my way (and nothing illegal, merely
sort of like the 911-information which means that the bad guys don't
want us to have it but that it is publicly available nevertheless if you
just know where to look for it).
Bottom line:  We know now the exact structure (frequencies, duration,
etc) of the CID. This enables us to code a tool to let us construct
replicas.  While you are really the originator of the call, your
telco won't think so, because the call they get already has the
CID header and thus they won't add their own. They will think
they are merely getting an already forwarded call, not a first.
Does this sound like complete hogwash? Comments wanted, please.

@_author: who's been absent for some days now? 
@_subject: NONE 
What follows is an advertisement by the Privacy Digest people.
        These people have been around longer than 10 years.

        Since these people are in Costa Rica, it will take more postage than
[ snip ]
        The copied text follows:
[ long advertisement for photocopied reports deleted ]
I am hoping for a reply from Tim May (who's been absent for some days now?)
and especially Black Unicorn; I know neither but have a gut feeling one of
them would have a comment or two.
My own 2 cents:
1.  As a rule, while lots of Cypherpunks are no doubt interested in related
themes (privacy in general, for instance, or liberty) please do not point
entire texts to the list.  Instead, sum it up and explain where those of us
with a yen to see more can get the full information.  This is not a flame
to you personally, Gary, but please heed it.  Otherwise you are flooding us...
2.  Dealing with your post specifically, I have to ask for your qualifications.
I happen to know this particular neck of the woods fairly well, as does Mr
Unicorn, and I know that Williams in Costa Rica has not been around for 10
years. In fact, on the same address and phone number, he has not even been
around for 1! (He did have other phones there before, granted).
3.  While not wanting to single out Williams (the "Privacy Digest people" as
you call them) because I have nothing more than a hunch, I want to let the
list know that there has been at least one US Government sting operated out
of a Costa Rica front address.  Also, another sting used the corporate name
of Financial Engineering as Arnie (Offshore) mentioned about a month ago.
4.  The stuff that Williams sells -- and that you advertised to the list -- is
not worth a lot of money.  His services, if they are for real and not a sting,
are good, but they are not organized efficiently and they are slow (I actually
opened a test account with him so I am qualified) which means that even if he
is not in bed with Sam you probably still ought to take your cash elsewhere.
5.  If you do go ahead and decide to buy his programs, be aware that their lega
advice is highly "inventive" and that much of their information is untrue or
at least misleading.  On more complex subjects (such as 2nd "banking passports"
he whips up 20 halfbaked pages of false info where in fact the subject needs to
be treated in at least 200 pages, thoroughly researched. And where the leading
authority in this field is in fact on his 9th edition now, totalling 400+ pp.
6.  Finally, some of Williams stuff is out of date.  Worse, at least one report
does not exist - and that is the one that would point to most government heat
if you order it.  Just out of idle curiosity, I had my foreign lawyer order so
that was how I found out.  If you order it (and if Williams is a front, or just
if the Evil Empire is watching his mail; which IMO is even *more* likely) this
mere fact will trigger an extensive immediate FBI investigation of who you are.
While I hate to say it, there is currently to my knowledge no easy turn-key
one-stop-stop "Where to go to break the law" foreign operators that I would
trust.  If you want true privacy, carve it out for yourself, don't rely on
someone who advertises a lot and sells photocopied reports to give it to you.
BTW, the services Williams are offering are sorely needed -- when they can be
trusted.  (Fiduciary accounts for everybody is one service, anonymous foreign
credit cards is another, and several of his services could come under the
heading of benevolent moneylaundering).
One day you will see them coming from somewhere else, with a more professional
twist and from guys who earn their bread off the fees, not off photocopies.
I can outlike how such a private 'parallel-bank' is going to work if asked.
For now, I prefer to post anonymously.
I would be interested in getting a pseudonymous account of the kind described
by 'Nobody' on Friday but would want a better place that mg5n to set it up.

The copied sheets put out by Williams in Costa Rica falls into that group.
I have read many xeroxes from lots of sources in my time and some most useful information have even been given to me anonymously.  The problem with the entire list of what Williams is selling (and I have some 90+ per-

Thus, it really matters little if he is a sting or not.  As a rule, I am
always cautious when entering into a new relationship and that has kept
me out of serious trouble so far.  When going offshore, I always assume
the worst until I have grounds for believing otherwise.  And like Sandy
Sandfort, I - too - have been to Costa Rica. Lots of small time villains
from the States call that country their home, full- or part-time.  Best to be careful about who you confide in.

that seems to be that the best information never finds its way into print.
In the world of private placements, few of the big players feel a need to
spend their weekends putting out newsletters.  Even if they do, they will
never incriminate themselves.  This is because most either live in the U.S.A. or do at least visit the U.S.A. often.  In ten years, if PGP is still legal and if PGP and remailers become easier to use (embedded in wordprocessors) this may change - not the part about them going stateside often, of course, but the part about their willing-
ness to speak up about how to use the tools of their trade.
Meanwhile, I have found one source to be consistent, reliable and surprisingly alert
throughout its several decades of publication.  It is a little green news-
letter called 'The Harry Schultz Letter', published by Harry D Schultz, a
libertarian privacy-advocate / gold bug in Monaco.  It runs around $300 a year, however, and so proves NetSurfer's point.  No free samples either.

cooperation agreements, offshore and privacy, second passports legally.

MC|IAs far as a real system goes, you will never see on running on a machine
in the US in the near future; in addition to the regulatory BS involved in
making magic money useful you would run into all kinds of wonderful
gambling laws and regulation.
Which is why the digital money with the most chance of succeeding will
be cyber-marks, -francs or -pounds, not cyber-dollars.   Work with the
currency of a country with fewer regulatory agencies.   The chances of
being allowed to stay in business increase directly as the number of
government witchhunters decrease.
Personal note here: in the past, I have been involved in several anti-
govt ventures, always with a view to altering the status quo in favor
of freedom fighters and kindred spirits.  Some are still going strong,
others have been victims of harrassment and even in some cases raids..
Of the unsucccesful ventures  -  the ones that were closed down by Big
Brother Sam  -  the true reason has always been that we were too smart
and getting away with whatever we were doing at the time.  So instead,
govt found some bogus charge to shut us down with. (In one of the cases
they bombed us with orchestrated tax audits, one after another. Later,
we were hit with Willful Failure to File something new they called an
Environmental Impact Report; this was in a case of knocking down a
storage shed!  If you think this is "BS", get the last case: On TV,
we had an associate promise a free bonus gift to the first 100 callers
to a promotion.  Upon shipping, we decided to give away the free bonus
to *all* callers, a few thousand all told.  This amounted to felonies
of fraud, mail fraud and enough to put our associate away for up to 10.
Of the succesful ventures, all have had one thing in common: they have
been headquartered abroad.  Our people there have had both Scotland Yard
and Dutch police look over the operations, always on the request of the
Americans.  We have even had an Inland Revenue investigation, requested
by the IRS.  In all cases, the govt went away empty handed and as good
friends  -  agents even apologized for the inconvenience.  Their word to
their U.S. colleagues: "We will not shut down someone who is not doing
anything illegal.  We may not agree with their political aims, but this
in itself is insufficient basis for prosecution."
ObCrypto: Anarcho-capitalists take note here,
1. In the U.S., the totality of federal regulations now comes to 202
volumes numbering 131,803 pages.  "They" can *always* find something in
there to shut you down with.  Their aim is to seize what you have and
put you out of business because you are not giving in to their demands.
2. Abroad, regulations are oftentimes of the common sense variety. If you
are a crook, you can and will be shut down.  But if  - like me - you are
honest, hardworking and just happen to not agree with U.S. policies of
oppression, then you will be free to run your affairs as you see fit.
3. If the operator of a succesful digital cash currency achieves for his
money more than play-money status, he will be intimidated into providing
traceability.  Sorry: there is no way he can insulate himself even with
prior legal briefs and a team of top lawyers.  I have been through it
personally.  We even had a bank in the seventies.  If the bureaucrats
target you, they *will* get you.  Sure, you can fight.  You won't win.
I only see 'untouchable' digital cash of having integrity and a decent
rate of survival if based abroad.
Personal experience tells me that it should be pegged to the pound
A futuristic twist with more widespread appeal to non-Europeans would be
to peg it to the ECU although marketing could be tough this side of the
common currency (year 2000?).  If pegged to the ecu, HQ should still
be in London.  Have James Capel or some such handle the escrow account
to guarantee real-money backing and -conversion.  Individual accounts
can be located anywhere and should stay out of mainland U.K.
Sorry for the length of this post.  Early choices now could mean the
difference between future success and the alternative: headaches + the
eventual inevitable caving in.

Does anybody remember PGP 1.0?  Released in the summer of 1991, using
the Bass-O-Matic cipher... which was worthless.
This list didn't come into existence until around the same time PGP
2.0 came out.  Thus, nobody railed against the weaknesses of PGP like
they are railing against NetScape.
So maybe the first version of NetScape could use some enhancements.
Just like PGP 1.0 did.
Nobody would argue that based on the direction of PGP 1.0, the whole
PGP project should be scrapped.  Or would they?
I think NetScape is doing overall good.  Sure, improvements can be
made.  But SOMETHING is being accomplished.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Crypto-anarchy, many-to-many communications, inter-
national/cultural communications, bandwidth price plummet,
computer ubiquity, philosophical/ideological evangelism, freedom
of speech/trade/association and other factors talked about on
this list are together heralding huge transformations.  With
this as background together with the statement that I am somewhat
of a "Frissell/Sandforth Optimist," let me present a short essay
and ask a single political question.
I want to propose that a change to more of a Snow Crash society
with anarcho-capitalism as the norm is not necessarily being
_caused_ by pressures listed above, but, rather, fit a grander
historical destiny.  What we are seeing and will see in the
information age has been bound to happen all along.  It is an
inevitable follow-on phase to our industrial age.  One way to
view our (Cypherpunks) work is "lead, follow or get out of the
way."  What's happening is going to happen.  I just want to be
in the center of it!  (I could write much more in support of
this.  Read Gilder, Rees-Mogg, etc. and much of the techno
Sci-Fi suggested by Cypherpunks.)
Hindsight is 20/20.  Many experts have analyzed the collapse of
the USSR.  Many are quick to claim that the dissolution was
inevitable, historical, even.
Consider the possibility that the dissolution of large,
centralized federal republics is also inevitable.  (The
Frissel/Sandforth Optimists have been arguing this exact point.)
As an interesting specific, consider parallels in the roles of
former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and the U.S. House Speaker
Newt Gingrich.
Gorbachev, by self-proclamation, was a communist first and
foremost.  He was in no way a destructionist.  In fact, it can be
argued that he never intended to weaken the central power of the
Supreme Soviet.  He introduced liberalization reform
(parestroika?) with the intent only of heading off the foreboding
economic collapse of his State.  Gorbachev's reforms were little
baby walking steps in a direction that the Bear already was
poised to _run_.
Mr. Gingrich is a REPUBLICan.  From what I can see, he loves the
Constitutional government process of the United States.  His
proclaimed intentions are for downsizing and deregulation.
However, he does not seem to desire the dissolution of federal,
central government.  He has not openly claimed to be
libertarian or anarcho-capitalistic.  :)
Will Newt's deregulatory reforms be baby walking steps in the
direction Uncle Sam (and the world) is already poised to _run_?

@_subject: Why emoney?  Why not a web of debt? 
[summary -- digital silk road along a web of debt-trust]
  Umm... money is not anything mystical -- it is just a convienient
way to trade and settle debts.  It was invented to solve the hassels
of trading a pound of butter, for a box of eggs, that for a tightly
woven basket, and finaly that for the gun you wanted in the first
place.  Yuch! accounting!!
  But electronic computers are good at checking out these kinds of
chains automatically.  Suppose there were a web of debt-trust.  Each
person would indicate the other people who's iou's they will accept
(and the amount they would be willing to take).  Thus I might take (up
to $10 of) Jo's, who might take Carol's who might take Terry's, etc.
  To buy something from me online, you will need to produce an IOU
from Jo, Carol or Terry.  I would hand it to Jo for verification.  Jo
would accept it or reject it (perhaps after talking to some other
folks online).  If it were a CarolIOU, or a TerryIOU I would insist Jo
trade it for a JoIOU.  All the details could be hidden behind a nice
little GUI.
  Jo and I would continuously balance the books between us by trading
JoIOUs for NoybIOU's.  After a while one of us might well end up with
enough extra IOUs that we want to get paid.  Perhaps the other would
perform services directly, or pay FRN's or gold, or whatever.
  If one of my friends wasn't able run an online IOU server, I could
probably trade things with my friend for IOU's.  Not that I'm running
a bank or any thing.
  With out every one being on line though I don't see an easy way to
prevent double spending.  Is there a offline multiple exchange token
system invented yet?

@_author: alt.anonymous.messages 
@_subject: Remailer 
In this message I will analyze message reordering in remailers, and
traffic analysis in remailer webs.
Remailers which immediately resend incoming messages provide no security against an attacker who is able to watch all traffic to and from the remailer.  Two proposals have been suggested to solve this problem, latency and reordering.  In recent discussions, the consensus was that message reordering was superior to (and the actual intent of) latency.  Reordering is not sufficient, a form of latency is required to make it effective.
In this analysis, I assume that the reordering is accomplished by keeping a group of n messages at the remailer, and sending a random one whenever a new message comes. This is superior to simply waiting for n messages to arrive, then sending them all at once (I will show this later).
The attack on the reordering remailer is simple. The attacker sends a stream of marked messages through the remailer.  After the waiting messages have been flushed out, any incoming real message will be flushed out of the remailer before more arrive, allowing it to be uniquely identified coming and going.  The defense against this is to only check the group and send excess messages after a time delay. This delay should be the typical time for n real messages to arrive. A mixing of approximately n messages is ensured by this process. If there is no attack, then the mixing is not quite as good as keeping a group of 2n messages.
Here is the math on the reordering schemes:
1) Wait for n messages, then mix and send them all.
2) Keep a group of n messages. Send one of the n+1 when a new one prob that the message has not been sent after x messages is (n/n+1)^x
Prob that it has been sent = 1 - (n/n+1)^x
Messages till 90% prob:  x=ln(.1)/ln(n/n+1)
For n=10, x=24, which is much better then 10 for scheme 1.
3) Accumulate b messages, then send a of them (Scheme 2 is a=1, b=n)
  x = ln(.1)/(ln(a) - ln(b))
  This gives the largest x  for a=1.
  In my example of how to defend against the flood attack, a=n, b=2n
  x = 33
  This is misleading, because it will introduce twice the delay as   scheme 2.
  Given the same delay, a=n/2, b=n, one finds that x=16.6
  That is better than batching, but not as good as scheme 2. The   smaller x is
  worth it, because a reordering of at least some minimum number of
  messages is ensured.
Some writer proposed changing n randomly to protect against this attack. Obviously that would not work. The attack will consist of many many more than n messages.
The second issue for consideration is:
Given a web of perfect remailers, how easy is it to identify corespondents? Tim has been asking this one for a while.
I assume that there is sufficient traffic through all remailers that any message entering the web could be any message leaving the web. This can be achieved, even with light traffic, by sending fake messages through the web to bit buckets. While they do not improve the security of the web as a whole, they help ensure that no tracking of messages within the web is possible, forcing it to be treated as a black box.
I assume that no correspondents are remailers themselves, and that all communications are random (random times with random people). This assumtion that all communications are uniformly distributed is terrible but....
This analysis only applies to indistinguishable messages. Each standard packet size can be thought of as having its own black box (a good argument for message splitting and having only one packet size).
To simplify the problem, I am going to treat the web as though it were clock driven. Some number of messages enter and leave the web each "tick" with no messages staying in the web between ticks.  This is a reasonable approximation, with the "tick" being the mean time of passage through the web.
Define "f" as the fraction of remailer using population sending a message in a given tick. This is also the probability that any individual will send a message in a given tick. The probability of a given pair of corespondents in a given tick is
The probability of a pair of corespondents occurring m times in n ticks is
        m
p= 1 - Sum [(f^2)^i (1 - f^2)^(n-i) n! / (i! (n-i)!)]
       i=0
Lets put some numbers in there. If people send 1 message per day on average, and one tick is 30 min., then f=1/48. If you watch the web for a month you will see 1440 ticks. If the chance probability of your sending m messages to your co-conspirator  is too small then you have been nabbed.
The condition for that is: p << (1/population)
The results for m=0 to 12 (using the above numbers) are:
m = 0   	p = 4.64811E-1
m = 1   	p = 1.30173E-1
m = 2   	p = 2.56257E-2
m = 3   	p = 3.86587E-3
m = 4   	p = 4.71498E-4
m = 5   	p = 4.81967E-5
m = 6   	p = 4.23687E-6
m = 7   	p = 3.26538E-7
m = 8   	p = 2.23961E-8
m = 9   	p = 1.38336E-9
m = 10  	p = 7.77044E-11
m = 11  	p = 4.00273E-12
m = 12  	p = 1.91774E-13
So, for a remailer using population of 10,000 you had better send less than 5 messages per month to your accomplice.  This only gets worse the longer you keep it up. You can not send 4 per month, month after

Of course, any second year computer science student can devise an

Of course it isn't.  Train somebody under BSD (say using csh/tcsh/zsh)

Unix commands are powerful and easy to use.  For example, to kill a
process I have to use "ps -aux" or "ps -ef" depending on which flavor
of unix I'm running, note the process id, and do a "kill -9 id".  Why
can't I kill a job by name (i.e. I can do a "fg %emacs" but not a

@_subject: Re: alt.religion.your.operating.system.sucks 
Well, maybe unix gets its reputation for being hostile because of
things like * many commands don't work fully (find, for example)
* a large portion choke on input that isn't "expected"
* many more do extremely poor input checking,
* the configuration files are bizarre
* different version have command with different options (stty
  everything, ps -ef vs. ps -aux, etc.)
* each version is slightly different (ever try porting a non-trivial
  program?  Look at some available large software and examine the     statements; look at the differences in system calls.
  Hell, look at the "config" program that comes with PERL - 80K of stuff
  to build a make file for the flavor of UNIX you are using!)
* the commands don't combine well (often uuencode + sendmail ==
  garbage)
* many commands accept a slightly different regular expression syntax
  than the shell does
* the commands aren't built with ease of use in mind.  For example, to
  kill a process under unix requires that I know it's process id.  How
  do I find that?  Run another command...
X-Windows is an extreme pain to get working.  Sure, if you buy your
unix workstation the manufacturer will pre-install it.  Just try
setting it up from scratch.

It always puzzles me that people on the net spend so much time griping
about Microsoft when the net tends towards libertarianism.  I would
think libertarians would welcome Microsoft's dominance, as a
validation of the free market in action.
I'm not saying you are libertarian, of course.
"Dos/Windows + applications available for Dos/Windows" are obviously
blowing out "unix + applications available for unix".
Normal people don't give a damn if source code is available for "power
tools" like PERL, sed, grep, wc, bc, strip, yacc, lex, puke, barf,
They want to cut and paste their spreadsheet charts into the word
processor they use, and email it to coworkers.
OS/2 is internet friendly, Windows 95 will be friendly, etc.
Certainly unix will let you do more, but most people won't care about
the value of the extras, as long as a web browser, news reader, and
mail reader is available.
Some people on this list swear they never have to drop to a command
line with the cool tools they use with their SLIP accounts (except to
change their password).  If that's true, then any "advantage" unix has
is washed away.  How will the unix market grow (relative to other more
popular OS's) if internet access tools run the same on Windows and
OS/2 and Mac's as they do on unix?

 i ran em thru sh and d/l'd em , and here are the
results of my tests . first , i pgp'd a file in
 binary format , then ran " perl pgppadt.pl
test.pgp 10 " . the error i got was " Couldn't
 create test.pgp.pad " . so i renamed the file to
" test " and tried again with good results ! i got
 " Input file test has size 732 bytes 10 bytes pgppad returns code -3 " . then , iran " perl  pgppad.pl test 10 " and after the bit about perl
running under dos/4gw protected mode , i get dropped
 to my command prompt . i took a look at the file ,
and it's size wasn't any different , so i renamed the
 file to test.pgp and ran it again and got the same
results . so i guess i'm wonderin' if it added the
 padding , or what might be the problem ? for your
info , i'm using perl 4.0.

@_subject: Re:  Why encrypt intra-remailernet. 
Perhaps the postage could integrally contain the request-remailing-
to field.  Supose the postage were  encrypted to
the remailer.  Then replayers would want to copy the to-address into a
new piece of postage.  But, we assume, they can't figgure out what it
is because they don't have the key for the remailer.    If the remailer issued it's own non-blinded stamps, the remailer
would have to keep a list of canceled stamps.  (For as long as that
series of stamps remains valid.)  If the remailer used Chaumiam e-cash
no logs would need to be kept at all.
  If everybody ran a second level remailer, and if they always
forwarded something (of very nearly the same size) when they recieved
an encrypted message, then without compromising the users machine it
would be imposible to say when a message was delivered.  Some of the
messages forwarded would need to be junk.  Is there a polite way to
send mail to a remailer, and ask it to junk the mail?  Some of the
messages forwarded would have to be 'part n of m' messages.

@_subject: re: unix, vanguard 
There is a well written essay on the "preeminence of unix" at
  It
essentially says Unix has survived for so long because universities use
it, and you could license it fairly cheap.  Most people (I'm talking
about 90% of computer users, even more in the future) couldn't care
less about features such as tying apps together with shell scripts, pipes, and some bubble gum.
What are some "robust crypto tools" that are available for unix, and also
aren't available for DOS/Windows?
I kinda think the reason more tools aren't available for PCs (Windows/Mac)
is because there is no appreciable MARKET for such tools yet.  If there
were, since PCs have a market share an order of magnitude or two larger
than unix, such tools would have a greater influence anyway.  Karl L. Barrus

@_subject: Re: unix, vanguard 
Not to prolong this argument, which hopefully won't turn into a lengthy OS
debate, but this argument boils down to the "users vs. developers" situation.
Sure, remailers and remailer lists are better implemented under unix, and
there may be as many as what, 50 people (developers) in the world interested
in doing this? On the other hand, several times that number of users will
access the information and actually give it value; they (users) don't need
unix at all.
Maybe I'm a market share bigot, but to me, if you want to spread crypto to
the masses, you have to do it with tools that run on the platforms the
masses use.
Who knows, perhaps in the future we'll see that the tools, programs, and
front ends run on more popular operating systems, and the relatively fewer
servers and scripts run on unix.

@_subject: Dir.Byway Virus (NewsClip) 
Is this legit?
New Computer Virus Attacks "Everything"
Burlington, Mass. Aug. 7 -- A new, hazardous computer virus is
spreading, that takes control of disk operations from
Microsoft MS-DOS or IBM PC-DOS based systems, the anti-virus
research team at S&S Software International is reporting. The
virus, dubbed "Dir.Byway," is described as a super-fast,
polymorphic infector affecting desktops, notebooks, and even computer networks.
Pat Bitton, S&S Software vice president of marketing, told
Newsbytes the virus is a very "dangerous" one. Because it is
polymorphic, it mutates with each attack, making it extremely
hard to diagnose and kill. The virus operates as if it is a
TSR (terminate and stay resident) program, infecting .COM and
.EXE files when the home directory of an executable file is
accessed, officials said.
Infections are not confined to the default home directory
either, but infects all executables in all directories of a
search path. In addition, the access does not need to launch
an application. Any kind of access triggers the virus, like
looking at a simple directory listing.
This ability to infect everything in its path makes Dir.Byway
a "super-fast" infector, officials added.
The virus creates a file called "CHKLIST . MS" (without
quotes, but with spaces surrounding the period) in the root
directory, and cross links all infected executable files,
David Emm, customer service manager, told Newsbytes. This then
replaces the normal DOS directory entries, making "CHKLIST .
MS" the start-cluster for every infected file.
If the user deletes the file, it reappears when any infected
file is executed. Also, if the user boots from a clean DOS
disk and runs "CHKDSK," the computer will report a large
number of cross-linked files. If the user boots from the
infected hard drive, the computer will report no errors. A
listing of the root directory using the command "dir/ahs"
(without quotes) will show the "CHKLIST . MS" file.
Dir.Byway triggers if the current DOS date is set to the year
1996 or above, and the day of the month is equal to the
month's number multiplied by two and two is added, like in
01-14-96 or 12-26-96. When triggered, the virus displays a
string of text every three hours, on hours that are a multiple
of three in military time -- for example, 09:00, 12:00, and
18:00. The text says: "Trabajeoms Todos Por Venezuela." S&S
officials said this translates to "We are all working for
Venezuela." On multimedia systems, this is accompanied by a
song that resembles the country's national anthem.
Emm said he is more worried about the spread of the virus for
now than the triggering of it, because it is so dangerous. He
told Newsbytes the virus has been detected in the United
Kingdom and the United States.
Bitton said the company's "Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit"
will remove the virus from infected computers. New versions of
the Toolkit for DOS, Windows, OS/2, and NetWare are slated to
ship in late summer. S&S also plans Fall 1995 introductions of
Toolkits for Macintosh, SCO Unix, Windows 95, and Windows NT
server and workstations.

John Fleming, along with a bit of support help from myself, is developing
a nym server that he is intending to release to the public once we are
satisfied with the performance and the state of the code.
At this point and time, John has pushed the code to the point where we
have am experimental nym server operating that is being constantly
refined and features added. Along the same lines, I am presently
working on solid documentation for when the nymserver is ready for
public use, and for the later public release of the code.
John created a mailing list for those interesting in contributing to the
development of his nymserver and as a forum for discussion of nymserver
related issues.  So far, there have been few folks subscribed, and no
answer from those that are presently subscribed to the list.  I find
this rather disappointing.
This is your chance to get involved in developing this server.  There has
been alot of interest expressed in nymservers on this list previously,
as well from other folks that presnetly use the type I and II remailers
that are running today.  Just like the other types of anonymity out
there, a nymserver has many viable reasons for existance.  The lack of
publically available code for such a server, as there is for remailers,
should motivate us to get behind John and his efforts.
To subscribe to the nymserver development & discussion forum, send
a message to majordomo with the line "subscribe nyms
" in the body of the message.  Questions about the
nymserver should be directed to that list so that all can be involved
in the development.

I heard something rather disturbing the other day from someone I do
business with.  I've been telling this company for 18 months or so
about the advantages of PGP and email rather than faxes, and they
finally tried it, liked it, and decided to use it a month or so ago.
Last week they got a visit from the Department of Trade of Industry
and MI5 (or is it MI6?) telling them to stop using PGP or they might
find difficulties getting export licences for their products in
future.  The visitors wouldn't say how they knew this company had
been using it.
The person who told me about this also said something about a
Department of Trade & Industry paper which mentioned that the British
Government was going to insist on key escrow for encryption.  I had
hoped to get a copy of this, but he can't find it at the moment.
I'll post the text when I get it if anyone's interested.

The difference, of course, is that its almost impossible to have sympathy for Dr. Fred. His hussle is for a hell of a lot more than subsistence. He was also never actually a master of his field, a fact that becomes increasingly obvious as our exposure to him goes on. Now he's reduced

@_subject: Bugs Bounty?? ... shhh ... I'm huntin wa'bits ... 
Or at least this was the headline on the announcement from                  I was immediately overjoyed when I read that first paragraph.  The sheer
delight and mention of rewards -- whether its frequent flyer points or
just simple little gold stars and pats on the head -- motivates me to just
go out and do it.  Go out and do whatever the offeror needs, so I can
collect my nice juicy reward.  A win/win situation.  But something about
this announcement seemed a little "too" polished ... (maybe it's just
seeing how the last "Netscape bug situation" was spinned, ... I don't
know). But I decided to read on, wanting to find out how Netscape "rewards" users
who bring them "bad news".  It was a slow afternoon, and I had just
finished listening to that odious Dominick Dunne on Larry King.  What the
hey, I thought. Let's read on and discover more about the Bounty from Netscape. Gee this was sounding, really really good.  But that FULL RULES thing was
highlighted on my screen (I was running Lynx 2.2 at the time ...), so I
had a quick little old jump over to the FULL RULES.  And with just a I was off ... and rule-reading before the big hunt ... The rules started off ... Wow, I said.  New opportunites to build applications ;) New ways to use
computers.  New ways to use networks.  All ushered in by Netscape.  That
all sounds really, really GOOD!! I was eager, and ready for all of this newness. Oh good.  Finally a company that's interested in making a product as bug
free as possible.  And Prizes and Bounties!!!  Joy!!  Joy!! My adrenaline began to flood.  Every neuron was piqued.  I was ready to
read on.  This was slowly turning into as satisfying a hunt as any one I'd
ever been on, even though we were only hunting for little old Bugs, and
not big cats.  None the less, it sounded like a fine afternoon of sport. Especially after Dominick Dunne. Hmmm, I thought.  This is odd. Here I am potentially reporting a very important problem, to Netscape, and
the company is saying that they might not even choose to respond to
questions.  I began to wonder whether Ford could have ever gotten away with not
responding to queries about their products.  Especially defects.  I
wondered what would have been the reaction if Ford decided not to answer
mail that inquired about the wee little problem with their Pinto's. But this was a different industry.  This was software.  Internet software. The hottest, sportiest, new-fangleddy dandiest stuff around. Not responding to mail, but of course!!  They're busily harnassing the
power of the Internet to deliver software that's bug-free.  They can't be
bothered with small things like customers.  They want bounty-hunters. But no need to let the glow fade so fast.  I'm sure that they'll just be
swamped with mail ... now let's get to their "proactive reward program"  (although I don't know how you reconcile running a contest to improve your
product with ignoring mail ... must be some newfangled modern hip-hop
do-op bee-bop communications graduate theory thingy, that I just don't
quite know how to parse.)
Hmmm, a severe bug (as defined by them).  Is this like a Level One??  I
wonder what that would be.  But let's get to the meat of the matter, what are the prizes that Netscape
is offering to harness the power of the Internet while they ignore and
don't (selectively) reply to email.  ... 'scuse me ... a nifty Netscape Mozilla mug??  50 of them do
you say?? Let's, see.  Last time I checked a single share of Netscape Communications
Corporation (NASDAQ:  NSCP) was trading for about $60 plus change.  I
calculated the wholesale cost of the mugs at approximately $1.20 each,
which would bring the total mug promotion budget (50 * $1.20) to the
equivalent of one single share of NSCP. Gee, that certainly motivates me.
But then again, there's those snazzy Netscape polo shirts. ;-)
Shame that Netscape isn't Microsoft.  I'm sure that other vendors might at least offer the Great Powerful Internet Bugs Hunters.a choice between the
snazzy shirt or the nifty mug?  But I guess most of the shirts and mugs weren't reserved for the Bugs Hunters.  They were probably in de press kits.
Wow, I thought.
I was stupified.  If I found one of the Security bugs, I could get a copy
of one of the Buggy Products absolutely FREE!!!  Gratis!!  What man could
turn his nose up at that kind of offer. This lil old rest-stop cum cafe, the one that's putting out the bounty
offers on the info-highway ain't like no little greasy spoon where you
stop for chile and then get CHARGED when you find a cockroach on your
spoon staring you down eye to eye. Heck no, this is a CLASS operation.  Dinner's on the house.
Now we're really talking ...If you find a really, really severe bad
problem, we'll reward you with the equivalent of 16.5 shares of Netscape. A veritable REWARD OF REWARDS!! Oh, oh ... incorporated into Netscape products???
This is sort of a non-consensual waiver of all of your rights by
participating in this contest??  Now this made me want to stop and
cogitate for a lil bit. I thought ...(but only for a second, of course, cause there were bugs to
hunt) and I thought ... and I thought that security bugs were much too
important to stop this over such a trivial matter, as negotiating my rights away for the benefit of possibly getting a mug. But there was no time to stop and think.  Security bugs were going to be
our target.  Big Game.  Non of that discretionary mug stuff for us ... we
can't be bribed that easily ... no sirree, bob. Tax on a mug??  Ok ... I think we understand each other now.  The budget's
tight, and all.  The plan really wasn't well thought out, and of course we
all know that the IPO didn't do that well, and blah, and blah, blah, blah. Ahh, but a hunt's a hunt.  So a hunting, we will go.
(Phew, isn't this a long post to the list???  I haven't really said
anything about the SECURITY BUG yet, have I??  Sheesh, I'm so, so
But first, what is a SECURITY BUG, anyway??  What does Netscape's marketing
machine consider a REAL SECURITY BUG??  If we know that, then we'll know where to look.
Before we get to that ... one last quote from Netscape's spokesman, Homer.
Gee, don't worry, Homer.  The POWER OF THE INTERNET will help you to
create products of the highest quality.  And the POWER OF THE INTERNET
will encourage a real extensive open review.  And watch for my new home
page coming to a web site near you. The one titled, "I DEBUGGED NAVIGATOR AND ALL I GOT WAS A LOUSY SHIRT."
But back to the question of what is a Security Bug??  Because I'm not sure
if Marketing is going to agree (in its sole discretion) with what a
security bug is (even if it has been hunted down).  So at the risk of
boring everyone to tears, I'll simply provide some external standards on
the matter, just so I don't jeopardize my bounty or my shirt or my mug. Let's start with some Orange Book standards. The Orange Book, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE STANDARD, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
TRUSTED COMPUTER SYSTEM EVALUATION CRITERIA (DoD 5200.28-STD) which we're
all intimately familiar with, since it of course sets the standard for
everyone from the Small Business Administration to the National Science
Foundation, (I think).  Anyhow, it makes these points: DoD Directive 5200.28, "Security Requirements for Automatic Data
Processing (ADP) Systems," stipulates: "Classified material contained in
an ADP system shall be safeguarded by the continuous employment of
protective features in the system's hardware and software design and

ADP systems that "process, store, or use classified data and produce
classified information will, with reasonable dependability, prevent:      a.  Deliberate or inadvertent access to classified material by
         unauthorized persons, and
     b.  Unauthorized manipulation of the computer and its associated
         peripheral devices."[8, sec. I B.3]
The concern here is with the latter standard.  The unauthorized
manipulation of a computer and its associated peripheral devices.  And
this is where we jump onto the scent of the track of the Security Bug. And this is where we introduce a little old document called pushpull.html.
from Netscape's Web site.  It's titled:  An Exploration of Dynamic
Documents. And I can think of many people who would _also_ like to push down data
to a browser.  But, that's not a great idea.  Guess what??  It's not even a good idea.  It might even be a bad idea.
Yes, the client "processes data" and then possibly displays it, while in
Hmm.  Netscape's clients blindly trust and follows server's instructions
and does what it is told to do.  If it's told to load a particular
document in five seconds.  It does that.  It dances to the server's
instructions. Something which should cause any Security Administrator's
hair to stand on end, as the server takes control of the client's machine and "manipulates it".
And this is the problem.  We have a pipe.  And we have a server making a
decision when it will send the next data block.  I guess the server could
also decide dynamically what that data block is going to be once it has
opened it's pipe to the client. That is way too much trust for a client to place in a server that it doesn't know if it can trust.
Yep, the appropriate window just "updates" itself at the command of the server.  A good faith update ... or let's call it a good faith process. Let's emphasize that what we have is a slave client at one end of a pipe
accepting an object-specific content-type from any server.  This is not within the tradition of multipart/mixed. And this is a problem.
Now let's play with the prior example.  Let's say that we utilized
different types of objects.  I'll use multipart/parallel and
application/postscript. I think that the foregoing explains itself without me having to draw any
more maps, than is absolutely necessary.  The first data object sent is
application/postscript.  The second object is multipart/parallel. And it's where we conflict with federal requirements:
And I think that this is applicable across the entire product line.
I wonder if this makes me eligible for a bounty for each product where there is this Security Bug??  That would be very chivalrous of Netscape
to offer me that.  Then maybe I could get a real computer rather than this crufty old Mac Plus (a yellow one) and my 2400 baud modem... and then, I might just be able to do some virtually real hunting.

                                  ...just another one of those...
P.S.  And yes I brought this whole issue (tangentially) to the attention of netscape.com yesterday afternoon.  I think I asked whether they were going to have a formal specification and register
their x-mixed-replace with IANA.  They haven't gotten to my email
yet, (I think).  Or maybe, I'm in the Bulk response group. P.P.S.  I give permission to have this propogate freely through         the cyber-aethyr.  All other rights are of course reserved.

As we know, security is always relative to a threat model.  For example, most cryptographic protocols today will not protect their users against the cloning attack I described earlier, nor more mundanely, against video surveilence of your computing space.  What can you do if you ARE worried about such attacks?
The answer is doing cryptography in your head.  Well not quite, since many cryptographic operations are very computing intensive, and not everyone can do 1000 bit mental modular exponention in a reasonable amount of time.  But if you have a piece of secure hardware that you can trust to do some of these operations for you, then all you need is a secure communications channel to this piece of hardware.  There may be other ways, but I suggest that you establish a common key with your crypto server ahead of time, and then simply encrypt all your communications using a symmetric algorithm.  RC4 may be a reasonable choice, since the operations are simple and easy to remember, but you need to keep track of a 255-byte state.  WAKE is probably better.  Although it uses a large key table, you only have to memorize it once, after which the only state that is changing is four 32-bit registers.
I am sure better algorithms can be found for this purpose if mental cryptography is made explicit as a design goal.  Perhaps it should be?

I totally agree with this. There are an awful lot of GPFs I've been experiencing with 2.0 that I never experienced with 1.2, and I am still trying to figure out that cause. The first one happened like 5 minutes after I ran the program whilst it was loading the Netscape homepage! Another irritating one that should have been caught is the download time indicator. When I download a file, the estimated time taken is shown in hours!
These trivial problems are really quite inexcusable, and should've been caught with good quality assurance before it even went out the door.

@_subject: Re: Netscape question transformed 
Actually, this is a very dangerous game to play, because realistically
Netscape gets both, foe and friend.  And they risk not only the entire company by taking this action, but they also pose risk to the public
They might get someone who responsibly tries to point out an incredibly
poor design methodology within ALL of Netscape's code -- the existing
installed code base as well as the new beta code.  Someone who points out this fatal design flaw to the public and not only to Netscape.
Or they might confront someone who announces that numerous pointers have
been placed in roulette programs making the Web under Netscape a little
more like playing Russian Roulette, rather than safe, fun entertainment.
Netscape clients might face a customized plexus, one that delivers dynamic
documents.  One time in six (if you're running CURRENT Netscape release
software) it deletes your WIN.INI.  Some machine in Bucharest reaches
right out, and wipes you clean.  Or maybe it just downloads all of your
Quicken files. Netscape is clearly not thinking clearly, here.
The issue here isn't "Bugs" and Netscape's so-called Bugs Bounty program. It's a broader question of design methodology and of design process.  Does
Netscape have a product that has any worth and utility??  Does Netscape
have a product which can go through a "Product Evaluation" and then a
"Certification Evaluation" as set out in the US Department of Defence's
Orange Book??  Or does Netscape's product fail the giggle test. I'll beg to differ on this one.  This is not about hackers, nor is this
about crackers.  We are not talking about some shareware game program
here.  Nor are we talking about a word processor, spreadsheet, or draw
program.  We are talking about a program that has a different mission
profile. The standard here is different.  A bug in code that makes your system freeze is different than a sloppy
design methodology that allows someone to literally take complete control
of your machine from any other machine in the world, whether that machine
is foreign or domestic. Code which seeks to secure a public network connection, calls for a
different programming altitude, than writing common PC code. The
tolerances are different, the expectations are different, and the
challenge (which was summarized most cogently by a UK friend) distills to
a single basic issue.            How do you invite a few billion people into your            home without having one of them nick the silver??
Evaluation of technical computer security effectiveness is not
accomplished by the release of "practice code".  It has to start from the
ground up.  And it is certainly not assisted by having a corporate
communications policy that is geared to NOT opening a communications pipe
with someone who has attempted to offer constructive technical criticism. Let me make this absolutely clear.
It should not be up to non-US citizens like myself to safe-guard US
economic security, and protect vital national interests.  It is not my job
and certainly not my responsibility to protect the international public
and Fortune 500 companies from poor security. When that attempt is made however, the effort should not be stymied by
Netscape's thinly veiled attempt at information free-loading through
public-relations puffery.  From this vantage point, Netscape's press
releases have the stench of some two-bit penny stock hustler -- something
I'd expect from some Vancouver Stock Exchange promoter, rather than the
standard expected of a company with a Two Billion USD ($2,000,000,000)
market capitalization. After emailing the company more than two days ago, I would hope that a
communications channel would have been opened, or alternatively I would
have held out a hope that someone from Sun or Netscape might have made an
official comment here or publically.  I would have expected something other than a stone-walling silence.
My Friday the Thirteenth post obviously has people shaken. Clearly, Friday
was not the day to comment about this serious problem.  There was no
utility in causing panic and disrupting trading in Netscape stock,
especially in a market that can only be characterized as frothy.  But now
here we stand, many hours and days later, with the questions raised
remaining unaddressed, and with my copyright restriction on my Friday post hereby, and herein explicitly waived.
The question is no longer simply a question of whether Netscape can
produce quality code, but a new question rises on the horizon.  Does
Netscape have the management depth and experience to meet daily corporate
requirements??  And is the promise of Internet commerce whether put
forward by Netscape, Microsoft or AT&T simply a pipe dream. A very risky game, they like to play ...

I agree.  I don't think it can jeopardize the company either.  After all,
we're talking about a company that has a market capitalization of more
than TWO BILLION US DOLLARS.  Two Billion Dollars can buy a lot of talent. Even if Netscape has to spend $100 Million on this problem, that sum
represents only 5% of Netscape's total market capitalization. I'm certain that Netscape has established a crisis control centre which is
manned and readied.  That a proper spin control program has been
implemented, and that a reasonable firm like Skadden Arps has been
retained. And I'm confident, that Netscape is drawing not only on its own resources
but that it's drawing on those who share Netscape's interests. Even if Skadden doesn't let you past security without a seven figure
retainer, I'm sure that if one of those nice boys from Morgan Stanley, ...
someone with snazzy Princeton ties ... maybe one of the ones who
orchestrated the Netscape IPO calls over to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
& Flom, I'm sure that one of those fellows will have their call returned
by any partner at Skadden. They're professional that way.
Well, I'm not sure that I'd want to make any representations or imply any
warranties whatsoever. We aren't just talking about a pre-alpha (Netscape beta) product.
We are speaking of something else here.  We're talking not only about a
problem in their NEW code, we're talking about a very big problem in the
middle of their EXISTING code.  A huge security hole in the code that
everyone is and has been running -- from 850,000 Deutsche Telecom
customers, throughout AT&T's internal organization and throughout their
worldwide customers, and god only knows how many individuals in the United
States and abroad.
This is an extremely serious software design issue.  It is equivalent
to designing and then building a house and forgetting to include any
plumbing, and no one really noticing, and no one really saying anything about it.
And when someone like Joan Rigdon calls from the Wall Street Journal, I hope that Netscape doesn't try to snow her.
She's been up and down the street ... and probably knows all about snow.

[snip of judging, verification, bidding ...]
Hmmm.  I'm glad that some people still have a bit of a sense of haha about
these things.  It's only computer code, right?? Right??  ;-(
Your idea about a bidding war for this type of code is _interesting_ but
not something I'd really like to see develop.  Good security and good code
are possible without this. Good people are out there.  The *best* people might be in academia or they
might be in retirement or even on a sabbatical.  They might even be in
other fields, or other countries, or as Netscape discovered to its
chagrin, they might be Berkeley students.  The question is how to secure
co-operation when they aren't motivated by ego, need, or greed. How do you attract the ones who simply know who they are, and WHAT they
can do, and simply won't put up with twaddle?? And frankly offering someone a cup, or a shirt or even offering someone a
$1,000 isn't the way to bring them on side.  I can't even get my
lineprinter serviced on Christmas Eve for $1,000. There's always a fine line between an insult and an offer. This would be a *basic* start.  Whether or not ISO-9000 is the way to go,
or whether it should be TQM, or something more modern is moot.  In
addition to some of the above, I might suggest parallel development units. Two separate program teams kept completely apart from each other, each
duplicating the other's work with the eventual goal of utilizing the first
reconciliation sets of production code as "learning experience", and then,
as part of a planned design goal re-evaluation and refinement, disposing
of the reconciliation set before "Fresh-Start"(TM) implementation. (This might necessarily lead to attendant presentation of individual
outplacement opportunities to select persons, as a team regrouping
Essentially a real-life simulation of the anticipated code-writing
process. Each group could develop its own unique vision and approach within the
context of the design goal, and should have demonstrated a willingness to
utilize challenge and justification modelling.  The groups themselves
might be dynamically balanced and re-balanced vis-a-vis personality and
code-writing styles. A positive creative environment should be provided, possibly in an
incubator-type setting, which meets creative, psycho-social, and
psycho-physical requirements. Essentially, the right balance between spa and boot-camp, a realized
vision.  An evolutionary development of Scott Adams' "Vision: Empowered
Employees Working Toward A Common Plan". A plan that centers around People. A New Plan that views employees as assets to be developed, nurtured, and
cared for rather than as expenses to be eliminated or reduced. A New Vision emphasizing Quality by remedying the marginalization of the
companies prime assets -- the employees.  An applied corrective ...  a
focussed deemphasis on productivity in anorectic organizations.  I might,
humbly, suggest as a title:  A New Vision, A New Plan:  Applied Complexity Theory (A.C.T.) in Action.
It truly is a long list ... as part of an "ACT in Action Plan"(TM),
Netscape should source long-range planners who can meet and exceed
day-to-day corporate expectations. I think whether or not it goes down, is not relevant.  If there has been
proper material event disclosure, then I doubt that there are actionable
grounds.  If there has been active acts of misrepresentation, then that's
simple fraud. Fiduciary obligations can be very complex without good counsel. Clearly by not having official announcements, it might lead a reasonable
man to believe that there might be trading improprieties through-out the
high-tech sector, among so-called "friends and family" or alternatively,
that Netscape's strategic misrepresentation program might be operative. Who know's??
One thing is certain though, disclosure obligations attach to all public
companies.  Sun, Microsoft, Netscape, AT&T, Viacom ... Maybe I should email postmaster??

Mr, Weinstein:
Is your comment about the "Bugs Bounty" program an official comment, that
you have "no idea how valuable" it will be??  Shall I give you a clue,
as to how valuable the discovery of a flawed algorithm might be??
How valuable do you think the ability to download an entire geo-physical
company's 3-D seismic data base is, while some company temp is looking at
a pretty picture of Moo Goo Gai pan, or downloading a recipe for goat-cheese
salad with ginger and macadamia nuts??
Why not admit that the whole Bugs Bounty program was a sham.  Nothing more
than a quickly slapped together public-relations program, that tried to
create an appearance that Netscape had a pro-active business plan.
Is it because there WAS no plan, whatsoever??
Why not admit that you were forced to take action and show that you were
"doing something" following the crack of the Netscape browser that was
supposed to protect sensitive information such as credit-card transactions.
And why not admit that what you did was raid a couple of left over press
kits, and take out some shirts and cups and throw together a damage control
program.  Your so-called "Bugs Bounty" program.
Is it because, a program that says that anyone who reports a "bug" in your
two billion dollar software wouldn't be rewarded -- no, they would
be entered into a draw where they _might_ could get a chance to win a cup
or a shirt??  Or they might receive a $1,000 reward as long as they agree
to a waiver of all their rights, and agree that by reporting the problem to
Netscape and entering the "Bugs Bounty" contest, that their report would:
   "become Netscape's property to be used at Netscape's sole discretion"
Is it because, this simply doesn't pass the giggle test??  And is
demonstrative of such a cavalier internal attitude and approach to
security that it can only be characterized as the grossest of misconduct?
I'm certain that even the marketing people must have burst into peals of
laughter at that one.
Why not admit that Netscape never thought that anyone would find anything at
all??  Why not admit that Netscape thought that they could weasal out of the
Berkeley crack, with a nice little pat on the head to the kids who found it??
Why not admit that not only did Netscape not have an action plan for "bugs"
prior to the "Berkeley crack", but doesn't have any action plan following it.
Why not admit that none of the cocky boys at Netscape had even considered
what would be done if there was an easily exploitable critical design flaw
in the algorithm.
And now that someone took Netscape up on its challenge, and simply said that
the emperor has no clothes, now that someone hasn't just discovered a "bug"
like the "Berkeley crack" but has demonstrated that the Netscape algorithm
is fatally flawed, by posting the exploitation algorithm, now what??
Good God, I asked for clarification from Netscape last Thursday, and Netscape
hasn't bothered to even return my email from almost a week ago.  And, after
posting the exploitation algorithm last week -- on Friday the Thirteenth --
there has been nothing but public relations huff-and-puff.
Clearly, no one performed adequate top-down / bottom-up analysis at Netscape.
And both the internal and external review process were woefully inadequate.
Or to steal a line from Jonathan Swift, in Gulliver's Travels.  Are you,
        "a most ingenious Architect who had contrived a new
         Method for building Houses, by beginning at the Roof,
         and working downwards to the Foundation ..."
and then done nothing else, but issue press-releases to hype and promote
Netscape stock in some self-centered attempt to help out your "friends"
on Wall Street.
Oh yep, I bet you're paying them.
I wonder ... are you paying them in shirts or migs, for their white-wash
review??  And will the report from the external review become "Netscape's
sole property to be used at the sole discretion of Netscape".
Which consultants are you going to get, Mister (unofficial, off the record
speaking personally, not speaking for the Company) Netscape spokesperson??
Who?  AT&T??
AT&T has security people.  The phone company, has very good security
people. And the phone company is supposed to have good quality control,
(ISO-9000 or TQM or something ...) yet AT&T's own internal security
review missed this gaping gash in Netscape browser software.  Even now,
AT&T is using this software internally within its business units and is
ACTIVELY recommending a co-branded version of it to its worldwide customers.
Has Netscape informed AT&T about this??
I'm sure that Netscape has piled their best people into their Falcon and
are busily jetting them around the world signing confidentiality
agreements and retaining every possible outside consultant.  Entering into
agency agreements to keep the lid on the biggest international news story
since the Tylenol or Perrier poisoning.
I wonder who Netscape will get to sign??  Who's going to lend their name,
so that Netscape can say that "we're working closely with Jerry Lewis" or
something similar to solve our security problems.
But Mr.Lewis can't go public with what he knows, can he??  Even if he knows
that Netscape is fatally flawed.  Mr. Lewis will be a Netscape agent at that
point, won't he??  And he'll be bound by the terms of his confidentiality
agreement, even if the company is actively strategically misrepresenting
his confidential report.
Who's going to be left after Netscape hires all these outside consultants??
Who do you hire??  Euro-Mickey, Minny and Donald Duck??

@_subject: Smoking gun invalidates crypto patent 
Finally!  Free public key crypto!
Rumors have floated for years that Diffie-Hellman patent is invalid because it was disclosed more than a year prior to the patent application. But it was never clear if Diffie or Hellman actually disclosed (in the legal sense) the invention. It would seem that Roger Schlafly has found a "smoking gun."  Through the legal discovery process, Schlafly found a copy of the "New Directions..." paper in the procession of an IBM researcher (Mike Matyas) with a stamped "received-
by" date more than a year before the patent filing. This copy did not have any confidentiality markings or indications of pre-publication Since Diffie-Hellman pre-dates Hellman-Merkle (the Knapsack patent), no one can assert any infringement of anything for the use of Diffie-
Hellman - it's free.
The real beauty of the patent system is that a patent holder has to defend validity no matter how many times it's challenged. So even if Schlafly should fail on a technicality, anyone else, an unlimited number of times, can challenge this patent again. (Note: One may question whether Stanford lied to the patent office about this. That's fraud.)
The following information is a matter of public record, direct from Schlafly's motion for summary judgment, dated October 16th, 1995.
3.    Diffie-Hellman is invalid because of a statutory bar.
3.1.  The Diffie-Hellman patent application was filed on Sept. 6, 1977.  According to 35 USC 102 (b), the patent is invalid and unenforceable if there was a public disclosure prior to Sept. 6, 1976.
3.2.  A research paper by Diffie and Hellman, "New Directions in Cryptography", IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol.  IT-22, no.  6, Nov. 1976, was submitted on June 3, 1976.  It discloses the secure cipher key generator of the Diffie-Hellman patent.  A copy of the paper is Am. Compl. Exhibit. U.
3.3.  A survey paper, "The First Ten Years of Public-Key Cryptography", was published by Diffie in Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 76, no. 5, May 1988. A copy of the paper is Am. Compl. Exhibit. V.  It states on p. 563 that the Am. Compl. Exhibit. U paper was publicly distributed in June 1976 and publicly disclosed at the National Computer Conference, also in June 1976.  That conference was open to the public, and well-attended by experts in the field.
3.4.  A true and correct copy of the "New Directions" preprint dated "August 1976" attached as Exhibit. CA.  It contains a full disclosure of the Diffie-Hellman invention.  Schlafly received it from the files of Mike Matyas, a cryptographer at IBM, on May 8, 1995.
3.5.  Hellman also lectured on the subject at the 1976 International Symposium on Information Theory, Ronneby, Sweden, June 21-24, 1976.
3.6.  The PTO was not informed of these prior art disclosures, as there is no record of them in file wrapper.

@_subject: Legal argument invalidates Merkle-Hellman 
More on free public key crypto!
The Hellman-Merkle patent claims to cover the entire notion of public key cryptography.  The patent holders say that any scheme which has a private key that is computationally infeasible to derive from the public key infringes on the Hellman-Merkle patent.  Here is a nice legal argument against that position.  It is taken from the public record, direct from Roger Schlafly's motion for summary judgment, dated October 16th, 1995.
Basically, the knapsack algorithm disclosed in the patent does not have the claimed property of computational infeasibility, so the patent cannot cover any system that does implement the claim.  For example, if I submit a patent that claims coverage of all forms of cold-fusion to generate power, and disclose an invention that does not work, then those general claims are not valid.  Someone who really does invent a workable form of cold-fusion gets to make the big patent claims.
4.  Hellman-Merkle is inoperative, hence invalid.
4.1.  The Hellman-Merkle patent discloses a cryptosystem popularly known as the "trapdoor Knapsack system", or simply "knapsack".  Ralph Merkle is credited with being the principal inventor, and he placed a $100 bet that it is secure.  Being "secure" makes it useful for communications or 4.2.  Time Magazine reported on Oct. 25, 1982 that the trapdoor knapsack had been broken, i.e., found to be not secure.  Merkle had to pay off the $100 bet.  IN patent jargon, the best mode was shown to be inoperative.  The article is attached as Exhibit. CB.
4.3.  Apparently unhappy with the article, but not denying his $100 payoff, Merkle wrote a letter to Time Magazine, published in the Nov. 15, 1982 issue and attached as Exhibit. CC.  In this letter, he offered $1000 to anyone who could break the "multiple iteration knapsack" system.  That system was the only alternate mode disclosed in Hellman-
Merkle which was not shown inoperative by the work described in Time.  Merkle recommended using two or three iterations.
4.4.  Two years later, Merkle had to pay the %1000 to Ernie Brickell who broke the Hellman-Merkle trapdoor knapsack scheme with up to 40 iterations.  The Diffie survey article cited above (AM. Compl. Exhibit. V) documents on p. 565-566 the failure of the Hellman-Merkle invention.  (Note that Exhibit. CI recommends this Diffie article.)  One of Brickell's articles on the subject, published as part of the proceedings of Crypto '84, is attached as Exhibit. CK.
4.5.  Note that Exhibit. CD, a paper in the Communications of the ACM, a leading computer science journal, has an editor's comment that "the trapdoor Knapsack systems have been broken".  This is a direct reference to Hellman-Merkle being inoperative.
4.6.  The Hellman-Merkle patent is invalid and unenforceable because it is inoperative as disclosed.  Claims 1-6 and 14-17 require a quantity computationally infeasible to generate from a public key.  Claims 1-3 and 6-17 require secure communication over an insecure channel.  There are no other claims.  As documented above, it turned out to be feasible to compute the  secret key from the public key.  It follows that the claimed computational infeasibility is not achieved, and the communication is not secure.
4.7.  PKP partners RSADSI and Cylink have known the Hellman-Merkle invention to be worthless since at least 1985,  and have not used it in their commercial products.
4.8.  As further proof of the failure of Hellman-Merkle, PKP is refusing to allow it to be used to protect their own trade secrets.  There was a motion before the Court which hinged on this issue.  In PKP's Reply Memorandum, PKP argues that protecting its trade secrets with Hellman-
Merkle is tantamount to putting them in the public domain.  Schlafly interprets this refusal as an admission that Hellman-Merkle is not 4.9.  The Hellman-Merkle invention is not useful because of the flaws explained above, and therefore fails to satisfy the 35 USC 101 requirements for patent protection.
4.10.  In the alternative, Schlafly argues that Hellman-Merkle is invalid for reasons of nonstatutory subject matter.  See arguments pertaining to the RSA patent below.  Hellman-Merkle discloses more hardware than RSA, but none of it is novel, and all of the RSA arguments apply.  The trapdoor knapsack system is described in Exhibit. CE, a Scientific American article by Hellman.  It is readily seen to consist purely of mathematical formulas.
4.11.  PKP may argue that the Hellman-Merkle claims are broader than the disclosed embodiments, and therefore the patent is valid in spite of the failure of the embodiments.  This notion is absurd, and incorrect as a matter of law.  Abstract concepts and ideas cannot be patented at all, and certainly not with an inoperative disclosure.
4.12.  In addition, there is prior art on those abstract concepts.  See the conference abstracts submitted by Diffie (Exhibit. CG) and Hellman (Exhibit. CH).  These were published in June 1976.
4.13.  In the Hellman-Merkle file history, the inventors argue that they are entitled to broad patent claims because earlier embodiments of public key cryptosystems in the prior art were impractical.  If their invention is impractical, then it is no better than the prior art they

@_author: which follows 
@_subject: Re: Netscape rewards are an insult 
OK, Netscape functions by DESIGN as an enhanced delivery vehicle.
Is that a sufficient explanation of the hole?? or is more detail necessary
(which follows):      Netscape blindly trusts any and all ports on all servers.  On the      basis of this trust, it begins a negotiation with a server that      might well have a dynamic deliverability capability.  The client then      examines a Content-type header, trusts the content-type to decide      what application it should launch, and then launches and processes      the data block it is fed, all on good faith.
     It even trusts the server to redirect it to any arbitrary destination
     which it automatically loads and then executes.
Is this enough of an explanation??  Or should I paraphrase:
      Netscape is a gateway that permits an untrustworthy server to take       complete control of a client's machine.  The server can tell the       client where it should go, what it should load and how often, and
      what applications to execute on the client machine, as though this       arbitrary server were its master.
Does this help to underscore the problem??  The Netscape Navigator client was DESIGNED to be controlled remotely from
any machine on the Internet.  This is the "flawed algorithm".  W3 was
meant to be hypertext ... not a gateway that permits a server to deliver
customized byte bombs down a clearcut path by remote-control. If people don't know that you don't let another person (or machine) take
control of your machine and run programs on it ... well, like I said in
the past. So without giving out another "exploitation algorithm" to the Internet,
without extending a helping hand to Japan to retaliate against the US for
the American Japanese auto surveillance, I will simply quote from two
sources which are "public record" and mentioned in the FAQ. From the "Orange Book", one of the volumes of the Department of Defence's
"Rainbow Series" more commonly known as TCSEC (Trusted Computer System
Evaluation Criteria) and available from:  U.S. Government Printing Office         INFOSEC Awareness Office
 Superintendent of Documents     - or -  National Computer Security Centre
 Washington, DC 20402	                 9800 Savage Road	
                                         Fort George G. Meade, MD  20755-6000
which stipulates that:
      "... it is required that ADP (Automated Data Processing) systems
       that "process, store, or use classified data and produce        classified information will, with reasonable dependability, prevent:
        a. Deliberate or inadvertent access to classified material by
           unauthorized persons, and
        b. Unauthorized manipulation of the computer and its associated            peripheral devices."
The above quoted reference is public information.  And, since Netscape is
making "no-comment" I will quote Netscape's public information. Herein is the "flawed algorithm" which is just a fancy way of saying that
it's a flawed idea.  And this isn't new ... it's been there for a long
time. Generally, we don't routinely trust every other computer, foreign or domestic on the Internet to manipulate us by remote control.  This is
as basic as the idea that we don't give out our PIN numbers with our banking cards to anyone who asks us.  If someone tries to suggest differently, then they are a fool.
Let's recall that Version 1.1 of Navigator was released long ago, and
trusts every machine on the Internet to do just that.  It trusts every
other machine on the Internet to be "trustworthy".  Whether that machine
is foreign or domestic.  We are not speaking about the new and improved --
feature added -- "beta" 2.0 software, we are speaking of the software that
AT&T is using internally and is selling to its customers as we speak as a "co-branded" product.
Software which AT&T security "approved" of in direct contravention of the
most basic of basic security principles.
Let me reiterate this.
Netscape's current existing software was designed in direct contravention
of the US Department of Defence's evaluation criteria for Trusted Computer
Systems, the TCSEC.  It also contravenes the ITSEC (Information Technology
Security Evaluation Criteria) which is a document developed by the
British, German, French, and Netherlands governments.
(Anyone can get a free copy of ITSEC by writing to the Commission of the
European Communities in Brussels.)
Netscape forgot one thing about trust.  If you "trust everyone" ... even if
you always trust everyone, you always cut the cards.
And when you're playing poker at these stakes ... well ... 'nuff said.

With all of the Noise on this list, and all of the opinion that has been
expressed, opinion which would seek to slander, misrepresent or opinion
which would like to represent itself as fact, it has increasingly become
difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. Clearly, someone has a vested interest which they are expending a great deal of effort to protect.  My email to Netscape detailing their logic bomb has gone unanswered, and unacknowledged for ten days now.
Ten days is a long time for no "official" comment.  Just as ten days is a
long time not to answer email.
Rather than attacking individual posters, rather than questioning
credentials, rather than scaring journalists, rather than intimidating and
wilfully spreading misinformation to create confusion, rather than doing
any of this, I will simply quote the official minutes of the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) which is the protocol engineering,
development and standardization arm of the Internet Architecture Board
The IETF is a large open international community of network designers,
operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with the evolution of the
Internet protocol architecture and the smooth operation of the Internet. Request-For-Comments are a series of memorandums which act as official minutes of the IETF.  Request-For-Comments No. 1521 (RFC-1521) Subsection 7.4.2 is authoritative and has been reviewed and has received international approval.
To avoid the accusation, of misquoting, I will simply quote Section 7.4.2
of RFC1521 in its entirety. This memorandum has unlimited distribution and is available by FTP from
DS.INTERNIC.NET, NIS.NSF.NET, NISC.JVNC.NET, FTP.ISI.EDU,
WUARCHIVE.WUSTL.EDU, FTP.CONCERT.NET, or FTP.SESQUI.NET. European readers
might be advised to use the United Kingdom repository at SRC.DOC.IC.AC.UK. Asian & Pacific Users should probably use the local mirror for
WUARCHIVE.WUSTL.EDU, or alternatively, their local National RFC
repository. Hopefully this sets the record clear, once and for all with authority whose credentials cannot be questioned nor attacked.
I wonder though, did Netscape not know about RFC1521??
You'd expect them to, wouldn't you??

We're not asking you to re-create every possible configuration, but have you benchmarked Netscape against any standards at all??  And which ones??
This is true.  You can't visit every web page.  So what assumptions did you start off with when you first started your code design??  Did you read the appropriate memorandums upon which the Internet is built?

@_subject: Re: Netscape Logic Bomb detailed by IETF 
I see that Perry is as charming as ever?
Perry, I just don't think that it is wise to stick your head in the sand
and ignore a severe flaw in your algorithm, while actively misrepresenting
matters to those people who are not intimately familiar with the IETF. Perry, I'll call you on that one, cause you simply can't do it.  Postscript isn't like any other language around.  Operator names have no
special significance to the interpreter.  You can't just "strip out" dangerous commands.  They aren't "reserved" in the sense that operator
names are in other languages, like COBOL or BASIC. In Postscript, operator names are simply keys into a LIFO dictionary. This makes Postscript different from other languages because you could
redefine these names if you wanted to.  Stripping something from a
dictionary doesn't matter because, the search sequence is top down.  If I rewrite an operator name, and put it at the top of the stack, there's
not anything you can do.  Gee's Perry, even if you haven't stripped something out, I can rewrite it. And the interpreter will find the rewritten version before the version
that's in your machine. And before someone attacks me for an inelegant "style" these potentially
confusing antics are routinely used under extraordinary circumstances.
There's no malice involved at all, simply real-world operation. And this is why the Request-For-Comments from the IETF warns:
   "Postscript is an extensible language, and many, if not most,     implementations of it provide their own extensions.  This document
    does not deal with such extensions explicitly since they constitute
    an unknown factor ..."
Is that clearer??  If you thought that you had "safety" cause you stripped
your interpreter, then you're in trouble, cause that doesn't work. Well, that line might work on those who don't know any better, but that's
also why the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) tries to protect the public by suggesting that implementors like Netscape not pass the ball:
    "The execution of general-purpose PostScript interpreters entails
     serious security risks, and implementors are discouraged from simply
     sending PostScript email bodies to "off-the-shelf" interpreters."
Netscape ignores this suggestion.  I guess that Netscape simply knows more (or cares less??) than the entire
collected wisdom of the International contributors who make up the IETF. Gee, there's lotsa wisdom over there at Netscape.

Actually the US government and US industry generally does not follow any
coherent industrial development policy of which ITAR is but one single
part. There is almost a jingoistic belief in the "free market"  with a
concomitant commitment to a strong American individualism.  While this
may function domestically, it certainly does not function internationally. The US continues to cede entire industries through poor economic and trade
policy.  I guess, nothing was learned with Boeing and Airbus. ITAR regulations will simply lock-out US companies from foreign markets,
and this combined with "competition" rather than "co-operation" will allow
foreign firms to divide and conquer American firms.  Foreigners generally
don't trust "American" as it is. Historically, the US has deliberately sold inferior security products
while making representations that they were in fact secure.  While this
*might* work on unsuspecting civilians, internationally it just doesn't
pass the giggle test, and won't allow a US firm to even make the bid list outside their own borders in the not too distant future.
US companies will loose the entire international market, unless they begin
to think globally.  Non-legislated trade lockouts based on Nationalism are
extremely difficult to overcome. While John Gage, may laugh out loud, it is actually a very serious matter.
Trade secrets are not for laughter.  As an example, what value is access to Pacific Gas's LAN??  Let's suppose
that Pacific Gas could be compromised because of poor security or
encryption -- a compromise which occurs as a result of some user
installing a commercial web-browser which had a well-known "back door", a
browser like the Netscape product. What would be the fallout from this??
Maybe (domestically), Pacific Gas customers might not be _happy_ that
PGT's market book was given over to CAPP, and that foreign producers knew
*exactly* what Californian's Natural Gas open interest was in advance on a
real time basis.  And that CAPP, hypothetically, has used and continues to
use that information in trading on Natural Gas markets, which results in
all Californians paying a 30% premium on their utility bills. Would this be a laughing matter??  Who would laugh if natural gas prices were up (as they in fact are) 25 - 30% at the trading hub AECO-C? And while PGT might ignore daisy chaining, and advance the argument that
the hole was at NGX -- rather than at PGT, or maybe that the hole was
because a client of NGX installed a copy of Navigator 1.1 somewhere, how
far would the laughter carry??  Especially the laughter at the keystone
cop finger pointing?? Around the world, maybe?
The idea of a foreign group of producers positioning themselves through
high-tech scouting by taking advantage of the shoddy design of a "Made in
America" product so that they could indirectly tax the citizens of
California is _truly_ a laughing matter.  Trivial in fact.
The uproar of a class action suit by all the customers of PGT would be but
a small nuisance within the context of the international fallout.  Laughter will not be on the lips of US executives when it becomes known
that the security flaw in Navigator 1.1 was "well and widely known" within
the US software, hardware and security industry, and that ALL members of kept quiet about and around it. There will be little laughter at the catastrophic trade fallout if it is
demonstrable (as it was) that a US multi-billion dollar company knowingly
distributed a program which functions as a virus delivery vehicle, and
that all US industry members decided that their "industrial policy" dictated that they would not step forward and speak out. There will be very little laughter amongst shareholders and directors when they become aware that not only were entire markets sacrificed to "keep the secret" but that the entire US economy was put at risk.
Good-bye international markets -- not just for the said billion dollar company -- but for all members of the industry who domicile in the US.  Yep, and it's not even a question of someone else causing this.  This is US citizens, and US companies having a limited experience and view in international trade, and that very inexperience leading to their OWN creation of these problems.  Has anyone considered GISA in all of this?
Probably not.
As an example, I contacted AT&T, regarding the Netscape flaw which was
posted to the Internet on Friday the Thirteenth -- the flaw that Netscape
had "no comment" on.  I asked for AT&T commentary, since they were selling
the Netscape product under their own brand.  I also asked for referral to
their Security Officer, rather than their Public Relations people. AT&T's response??
    "...I am not sure that our security officers are up to it.  Often     AT&T just repackages an external product, without opening it or     understanding it.  My guess is that the corporation is likely to     simply trust the netscape folks unless an actual hole can be      demonstrated."
And with that, there's 'nuff said ...
I guess getting shot by friendly fire does sound better than saying that
you're shooting yourself in the foot.  Don't it?? Alice de 'nonymous ...

                    INFO BLACKOUT
 From THE SPOTLIGHT newspaper's TECHNOLOGY & LIBERTY column by Clark
Matthews - Nov. 06, 1995 issue.
   Powerful national security insiders have established effective control
over the entrance gateways to Internet. Disturbing signs are now emerging
that the "information superhighway" has been targeted for systematic sur-
veillance and political dossier-building on Americans' opinions.
   This ominous news came in the first of a series of articles by investi-
gative journalist Steven Pizzo in WEB REVIEW, an online magazine of cyber-
culture and politics ( published by Songline Studios of
San Francisco. Pizzo is the author of INSIDE JOB, a groundbreaking expose'
on the massive fraud and theft of insured deposits in 1980s savings and
loan debacle.
   According to Pizzo, control of Internet "domain name registration" has
passed into private hands-with the potential for serious mischief or
worse. "Domain names" are the odd looking identifying names that are as-
signed to individual computer systems that compose the Internet (logoplex.
com, for example).
   Through a complex chain of licensing arrangements and corporate acqui-
sitions detailed in Pizzo's article, this crucial control over Internet
domain names has passed from the non-profit National Science Foundation to
Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) of Herndon, Virginia. Last May, amid growing
public disbelief of Establishment media reports about the Oklahoma City
bombing provocation, NSI was purchased by Scientific Applications Interna-
tional Corporation (SAIC) of San Diego.
   SAIC is a $2 billion defense and FBI contractor with a board of direc-
tors that reads like a Who's Who of the intelligence community. Board
members include Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, the former director of the Na-
tional Security Agency (NSA) and deputy director of the CIA; Melvin Laird,
defense secretary under Richard Nixon; Donald Hicks, former head of re-
search & development for the Pentagon; Donald Kerr, former head of the Los
Alamos National Laboratory; and Gen. Maxwell Thurman (ret.), the commander
of the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   Former members of SAIC's board include Robert Gates, the former CIA
director under George Bush; current CIA director John Deutch; Anita Jones,
Deutch's former Pentagon procurement officer, and William Perry, the pre-
sent secretary of defense.
   The corporation also has a legion of computer network specialists and
an entire division of computer consultants. SAIC currently holds contracts
for re-engineering the Pentagon's information systems, automating the
FBI'S computerized fingerprint identification system, and building a na-
tional criminal history infomation system.
   The Internet is a marvel of computer software technology. It was de-
signed to survive a nuclear attack on the United States-like the Post
Office, it's literally smart enough to find a way to get the mail through,
even if most of the network is missing.
   But control of Internet domain name registration means the ability to
remove troublesome-or outspoken-computer systems from the network. Po-
tentially, this control also confers the power to insinuate "phantom"
domains into the network-for surveillance purposes, for example-or for
real-time, automatic censorship.
   Furthermore, anecdotal evidence gathered by this author suggests that
actual "truth control" is taking place on the 'net now. E-mail messages
with controversial contents-including the details of the SAIC takover of
domain names-have consistently disappeared as they travel across the net-
work. News items concerning the Vincent Foster "suicide" investigation
and allegations of NSA bank spying through compromised Inslaw software are
being quickly and automatically canceled. And the cancellations are not by
by their authors.
   With domain names under the control of secret government insiders, it
is even theoretically possible that large parts of the Internet could be
SHUT DOWN AND SILENCED at critical times. This could be accomplished by
suddenly altering domain name registrations or interposing compromised
"domains" at crucial points.
   These compromised systems could serve as "black holes" at critical
times, stopping e-mail and important news from reaching the world-or the
rest of the country.
   Exercises in "turning the Internet off" have already taken place in
Taiwan and Hong Kong. In Taiwan, the 'net was successfully shut down.
All network traffic-including news, opinions and e-mail sent by computer
users-was successfully "bottled up" on the island and prevented from
reaching the world.
   In Hong Kong, the Internet wasn't quite strangled, but the British
authorities who control that colony managed to throttle free electronic
speech with the rest of the world until everything was bottlenecked into
a few little-known satellite links.
   These are alarming precedents and sure signs that powerful, shadowy
forces are preparing to chop at the very roots of America's new Liberty
Tree. The secretive people on the board of directors of SAIC are intell-
igence professsionals skilled at manufacturing events-and then manufact-
uring public opinion and consent by controlling the truth. Will Internet
disinformation, censorship or "shutdowns" signal the next American crisis?

privacy and to see that their self-interest is served by having privacy. That's much more than "writing code".  If you have an insecure machine, a machine on which I can monitor your keystrokes as you enter your pass phrase, what good is strong crypto??
Somewhere between diddly and squat?
What would Perry have us do??  What does he want??  Does he want all of us
to order radiation detectors to beef up our random number generators?? Talk about a red herring!!
How about this instead Perry?  How about if you suggest that everyone make
sure that every Network which a machine connects to, and every other
trusted Network has removed the username/password combinations,
"tech/support", "LAN/admin", and "guest/user". This is easy to do, and is a solid recommendation. Unless the almighty
"Perry" would rather that you NOT worry about simple security matters
which protect privacy and are within anyone's control. There's lots of things I could think of doing to Perry's ass, and shoving his opinions is but one of them.
It was hard enough for me as a Canadian to watch 3 out of 5 Francophones
vote to separate from Canada and form their own nation. And to then watch
as two leaders from within English Canada -- Preston Manning who runs the
Reform Party, and Ralph Klein, who is Premier of Alberta -- breach
protocol and insult the peoples of Quebec by discussing, commenting and
gloating over the overall election results even before concession speeches
by Bouchard and Parizeau.
And I groaned later when Parizeau said that the overall vote squeaker was
a result of "money and the ethnic vote."  Touche. But this is nothing in comparison to listening to some jackass talk out of both sides of his mouth, while he deliberately attempts to steer people away from what the MAJORITY of posters to this list have a strong common conviction about.  Securing their systems and their personal privacy.
It might be a rag tag bunch with differing political ideologies, but one idea brings all of us together here.
Except for one ... jackass.
And yep, I'm back after a brief silence.

@_subject: Re: Sun speaks out - but not to the cypherpunks 
No one needs to listen to anything if they don't want to, Todd, but I think that some things need saying none the less.
I think the old saying is: You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him think, or something like that ...
Hmm, this is a very interesting prespective, coming from Sun Engineering
as it were. The company that says that the Network is the machine, or
somesuch.  I always thought that security consisted of everything: hardware, software, and wetware. (Or it did the last time, I checked my handbook.)
Admittedly this is a horrible inconvenience, especially when it comes to
security. This may well be true.  But sloppy design, design which ignores the most basic difficulties cannot be brushed away by simply saying that "it exceeds theoretician's predictive abilitiies."
That simply doesn't cut it.
"Ignoring the obvious" is simply that.  It's a planned process of
"ignoring the obvious". One example of this that should serve as a useful case study is a recent
problem which was brought to the Canadian public's attention just this
week, on a program called the Fifth Estate.  The CBC (Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation) detailed a software code problem in one of
AECL's (Atomic Energy of Canada Limited's) instruments which deliver
penetrating radiation. The software which controlled the radiation dose, would periodically
override the oncologist's calibration and deliver a radiation dose 100
times what was prescribed.  This software "bug" literally killed wherever
the machine was in use. A simple hardware solution engineered into the product as part of a
redundancy check program would not only have saved many lives, but could
have confirmed that there were serious code deficencies.  A redundancy
program which AECL did NOT have. Then again AECL did not consider that it had to mathematically prove it's code either.  So I guess, they "ignored the obvious" not once, but twice.
A simple lesson can be learned here, one which I believe is applicable to
Java. If your parameters are going to be that you cannot trust your production
code, then you MUST engineer on that basis, that the production will not
be trustworthy, rather than simply crying like Chicken Little, that
mission critical applications must simply "live with" engineered
inferiority. Or alternatively, another lesson could be pulled out:  To avoid this problem, ensure that your code is mathematically provable or utilize appropriate hardware overrides.
Case study,   Netscape.
During their code design, they assumed that all servers on a network were
trustworthy and would continue to be trustworthy.  They designed their
product on that basis.  In fact, over time the very opposite will be true. As an exploitation algorithm propogates, the significant percentage of
servers which are NOT trustworthy will begin to grow exponentially. The true assumption which Netscape should have started with is a simple one, and is the only assumption that ANY production house can start with:  that the network has a reliable transport mechanism, one which will route around damage.  That's it.  Any other assumptions are poor design and engineering and are demonstrative of a misunderstanding of the environmental conditions in which the engineered product is expected to I can't speak for "Dr. Fred", but I always worry when people start to
refer to something as a "gem", and start talking about the "enormity of
the task".  Especially if an engineer starts talking in such lyrical,
flowery prose.
Enormous tasks always lead to complexity which can never be solved by
simple linear thinking.  And the engineer from Sun is right, that it will
be some time before first generation products are available.  (This will certainly be the case if "mathematical proofs" become mandatory
as part of an ACT in Action plan.  )
Well, I'd rather that marketers stick to marketing AFTER a product development cycle is completed.  Generally, you would think (hopefully) that people who are technologists, just *might* have a better knowledge of what they have, (or don't have) wouldn't you?
Maybe??  Or maybe not ...
After all you wouldn't want some kid, some little snotty brat, some kid
who started playing around well over a decade ago -- when he was in his
teens -- as a projadmin on one of Honeywell's Multiplexed Information and
Computing Service beasts showing you up for your temerity?  Or would you cry about the "kid" slamming you? Well if we're gonna bottom line it, and talk turkey, and leave Chicken
Little back at the table, skewered as it were, I'll extend a helping hand. The net/net is really, really simple, a product that doesn't perform as
advertised is not a saleable commodity.  No one buys cars which don't
start or cans that leak.  Sure you can have a body by Pininfarina or one
by Alcan but if the engineering isn't there under that beautiful skin then
you don't have ANYTHING TO OFFER FOR VALUE. Well. It's just not my responsibility to create a solution.  And I have a
tendancy not to "bitch and moan".  I might be one sarcastic castrating
SOB, but bitchy and moany is not something I'm routinely accused of. I simply have a reputation for a degree of frankness.  Nothing personal is
meant by it.  I'm actually a very nice person. Appreciated.  And I mean that with sincerity that your comments are
appreciated.  I understand that each person here DOES express their

 Does anyone on this list know if the CBC has a web site on the Net?
I'm hoping that someone (hint, hint) who has a convenient website, one
with lots of spare bandwidth could volunteer to contact the CBC and
persuade them to copyright clear the Fifth Estate program clip which
documented some of the risks of software bugs in mission critical
applications, and allow it to be placed on the Net.  I'm hoping that this
English language piece reaches a wide international audience. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is a Crown Corporation which has
historically received its primary funding from the Government of Canada. Recently, it has suffered under the budgetary ax, and the push for
privatization.  I'm pretty confident that the Corporation would copyright
clear the clip for MPEG distribution across the Net, if they were
approached with the concept that the clip was a demonstration of the CBC's
journalistic excellence and integrity, a piece which is demonstrative of
the critical need to continue their funding.  A concrete demonstration of
the need for the CBC.  And a piece which could well receive deserved
international acclaim. The site would help them, and would simultaneously be a site of
international public service. Nothing will drive home the need for quality software, quality code, and
quality security more than the vivid graphic pictures of the consequences
of sloppy code, or of the risks if certain critical systems, LANs, or
private networks are compromised, or if security and privacy (which are
flip sides of the same coin) are ignored. The sight of a body, that has had a hole burned straight through it from
the front through to the spine is truly chilling and drives the message
home.  Nothing seems to speak as clearly as a picture ... as to what the
stakes are ... of what "bugs" in code do ... and of what a network
compromise can leave in its wake. A picture of consequences.
Six people died in Canada and the United States due to the software flaw. Even after numerous reports of the flaws, the company refused to even
acknowledge the existence of a problem, and in fact did everything within
its power to make sure doctors, radiologists and physicists were unaware. The attitude of trivialization can only be characterized as fantastic, and
would be unbelievable to anyone who has not viewed the piece. It's one hell of a backgrounder which not only details problems, but looks
at solutions -- it examines attitudes, especially management attitudes.  It
truly deserves an expanded audience.  From teachers, to students, to the
international media, to the concerned private individual, all will be
served well if this piece gets wide attention. Takers, anyone??

anyone should be placed on the defensive, for *choosing* to maintain
some semblance of a personal life, or wishing to maintain some
illusions that they might still have some shred of personal privacy
left.  Hopefully, we can still leave a man with his dignity.
I should not have to defend my right to present my ideas as I believe

At this time, I don't feel that a bi-directional private communications
channel is needed.  I have no need for a "nym".  People who need to
contact me, can.  People who would like to know a bit about me, can. Netscape has my address.  So does AT&T.  And reputations aren't pertinent. (Although, I will say, that the disappearing here-again, gone again,
internet draft at ds.internic.net is simply childish, and I'm certain that
it was just routine "file maintenance" that caused the flicker.)
The ball isn't in my court, it's in theirs.
Netscape and AT&T are some of the primary parties who will have to take
the hit for the fiasco that they find themselves in.  For now, I'll leave
my communication channels with them open, rather than letting my mail
queue fill more than it already has.  Email that is already overqueued. I don't really envy the two companies' position.  No one expects to find
as significant a security flaw as my anonymous email to this list detailed
at this stage of code Burn-In, and I don't take any pleasure in facing the
unenviable task of informing ANY party that a Trojan Horse has been
engineered into the fabric of an existing globally installed code base. No one does.
And as the messenger, I (hope) I don't have anything to fear, from the NSA
or any other foreign group that would seek to pursue its own agenda within
the borders of sovereign Canada.  I really don't think that the NSA is
"evil incarnate", as some list subscribers do.  They have their
intelligence and know how to use it.  Usually, they use it prudently. If I did have any worries about the NSA, then I might take some elementary
precautions.  I certainly wouldn't have my terminal screen pointing
towards the twelve odd feet of open glazing that sits behind me, as I
currently do. Privacy can't simply be reduced to "a desire to hide from the NSA", just
as security isn't something which is simply provided by licensing from
RSA. Look to the message rather than the messenger.

You too, eh??
I wish that Detweiler could (seriously) go back to wherever he came from. Hopefully this time, he can make the attempt ... backwards. I no longer become incensed at his type of spoofing.  I understand that a
message may look like it appears to come from a site, but it in fact
doesn't.  Who really knows??  Even a message that is PGP signed isn't guaranteed to be from the person
who apparently signed it.  Someone might have a web server that asks
Netscape Navigator (very politely) to send out someone's secret PGP keyring,
or asks Navigator to monitor a person's keystrokes when they enter their
password, or heaven forbid their electronic daytimer.
Once you have that, it's easy to send a forged PGP SIGNED email.  Even worse, most readers of email will tend to believe that an electronic signature is prima facie evidence that a message is from who it appears to be from.
It just doesn't work that way.  You have to look at the message and use "fuzzy" logic to determine how
probable it is that a given message is from the person who it represents
itself as coming form.  And sometimes, you'll be wrong.
Just like the good old, "Dr. Frederick B. Cohen", who posted to this list. Is he really the Dr. Cohen, noted international computer virus expert, the
very man who coined the term "computer virus", or isn't he?  Is he the man
who the US military approached to verify whether missile guidance systems
could be compromised by a foreign power utilizing a trojan horse or virus,
or not.  Do we believe his web page?? Even if we do, do we place a greater degree of trust in his words, than
that of say, yours truly, Alice de 'nonymous, or of someone who claims to be Tim May when they BOTH say that there are very serious flaws and deficincies in the Netscape Navigator product?  Or do we infer that a "no comment" coming from AT&T and Netscape, acts as confirmation that the *information* in the post is reliably correct.
It's impossible to say with certainty.
Maybe if someone on this mailing list attended Dr. Cohen's talk today at the Hilton Hotel, in Washington, D.C., and fills us in with what he said, (if we can trust _that_ poster) and we independently verify for ourselves
whether what _he_ (Dr. Cohen or Mr. Confirmation) is saying *seems* to be
reasonable, then we _might_ be able to say that we _may_ be reasonably
certain, that we DO have an international celebrity amongst us and posting
to this list, and notifying the world of a serious problem.
I mean what would you expect, a Press Release??

Suppose you want to mail or post something sensitive enough
to chain through several remailers with PGP encryption at every stage
to protect the privacy of communications.  PGP can bite you.
The PGP comment feature lets you stick one (or more?) lines of comment
into your encrypted messages, after the Version: line but before the
encrypted message body.  If you use the PGP comment feature to say something
more or less unique (mine says that you can get PGP outside the country
from ftp.ox.ac.uk), anybody eavesdropping the last remailer in your chain
can notice this in the remailer's input and recognize that it's from you,
even though you've chained through six different places to get there.
It's still encrypted, and protected to the extent that the remailer protects
you, but if the remailer is corrupt or your message can be identified by size among the other remailer inputs, you're hosed.
So, for safety, either turn off PGP comments before using it with remailers, or wipe out the comments by hand  before each layer of encryption

Oviously, Newt missed a briefing somewhere.  His comments leave the
impression that -- in the recent past and even at present -- we only had
encryption which Governments could break.  This is nonsense. We've always had encryption which the government couldn't break.  We've
had it in the past.  We have it at present.  And we will have it in the
future. We've always had "non-breakable" private communication. A simple example.  If I was negotiating at a table with my legal team
around me, and the opposing team across from me, and I wanted to send a
message to my team that is for their eyes only, all I have to do is write
something on the writing pad in front of me, and I have a secure
communications channel to them. I can even write it in plain text. My team sees it, while the other team doesn't.  This _really_ should not surprise anyone ... especially Newt. Alice de 'nonymous ...

@_subject: Re: DejaNews all over again 
Fascinating.  First, I'm accused of being noted computer viral expert, Dr. Frederick B.  Cohen, (simply because he agrees with my assessment of
the critical algorithm flaw in Netscape Navigator) and now I'm accused of
perhaps being at the other end of the spectrum.  Of being Detweiler,
simply because he can take my signature and identity by signing an email,
as Alice de 'nonymous or simply accusing me of posting in his "style". I see that the character assassination sport continues, and I am now a
targetted.  Hunter become hunted.  I wonder why??  And why, by of all
people, Perry?  Is it perhaps because, I speak the truth, and the truth
makes people very, very nervous.  Is it because the flaw which is in the
Navigator product is woven into the code fabric, and can't be *fixed*. Afterall, Netscape (and AT&T) have had, over THREE WEEKS to work on this
problem or to make some form of public comment, and have done nothing, but
put some of their programmers -- unofficially ... speaking for myself ...
not speaking for the Company -- programmers on this list
Meanwhile people are having their PGP keyrings collected, their passwords
monitorred, and all of the information -- even information which they have
NOT posted to Usenet, information that is simply on their personal hard
drives, or on a private corporate network that is behind a firewall --
collected by anyone who actualy understands *how* to use Netscape
Navigator's standard features to do it. And so the question is: Why am I having my character asassinated while
this threat continues??  And while the loss and damage continues.  Why
are Netscape and AT&T not mitigating the damage?
Is it because what I say is simple common sense stripped of the veneer of
"technical language" and jargon??  And can't be *commented* on or *fixed*. Is this the fear which any truth teller faces, not only on the Internet,
but in any forum where they try to challenge Goliath. Maybe, that's one reason to post anonymously.
To clear the record definitively, I am neither Detweiler nor Dr.
Frederick B. Cohen, and I am not the issue.  I am simply myself, and I
will _reveal_ my identity to the international public once the timing
is appropriate.
If anyone wants to know who I am, they can contact the PR department
of AT&T or Netscape and ask.
(Their address can be requested from either postmaster or postmaster respectively.)
Both companies have an email address for me, and would _likely_ *cough*
forward any email enquiries to me without any editing.  That way,
everything is done clearly and out in the open.  Nothing hidden, and
nothing private, and none of my comments will become "their sole property
to be used in their sole discretion". Neither company can accuse me of attacking them with daggers in the
dark of night, from behind a shield of anonymity, when I advocate
public open disclosure and commentary.

@_subject: Re: PGP Comment feature weakens remailer security 
Mmmm, sometimes we do ... Sometimes we even think, if I were a lil wa'bbit, where would I go hide
... especially when we do a bad Elmer Fudd impression of Bugs Bunny. An interesting problem.  If you are going to take multiple passes, and do top-down and bottom up
analysis, then you can't really parse on the fly. It pretty much has to be
a batch job, I think.  You have to get your data, and then check it.  You
can't simply *trust* that there is not any corruption, and pass all of
your data through. And if you're going to parse in a single pass, then we're back to the problem of monkeys sitting at typewriters and Shakespeare's sonnets.
Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple.  The likelyhood of corruption is not based on each past run.  It's just like rolling dice.  The odds of rolling boxcars is 1 in 36 (I think) no matter how many prior times, you've rolled boxcars.
Twenty passes doesn't influence whether you crap out or not on a single
roll.  Nothing *remembers* past performance to ensure that something
doesn't happen (or happens) many, many times in a row.  I guess, this is
why Atlantic City, Baden Baden, and Las Vegas generally do as well as they
do. Alice de 'nonymous ...

@_author: if this is the AT&T, Steve Bellovin 
@_subject: Re: Many Topics are Appropriate for Discussion Here 
I'd be interested as to whether or not they are tuned in here, either
directly or indirectly through some type of list reflector/filter.  Some
people might just read this list and not post.  They may not have anything
to say or contribute, or maybe they just don't want to add to list noise,
but hopefully they do keep up with the mailing list discussion as a first
priority. Just because someone doesn't post, doesn't mean that they've left, or not
listening.  It just means that we aren't hearing from them. Steve Bellovin, (if this is the AT&T, Steve Bellovin) has corresponded
with me.  He wrote me about the security flaw in Netscape I detailed to
this list, so I can assume from that, that he IS aware of it and is still
aware of the list (if it is the AT&T Steve Bellovin, I mean).  If not, my
mistake. I suppose I could ask him whether he is reading this list, or not.
Is Steve AT&T's Security Officer or something?  He never really introduced
himself when he emailed me, and he never presented me with any credentials
or letters of introduction.  But if he is so well known (news to me), and
has a well known reputation -- probably a reputation on a par with noted
international electro-virologist, "Dr. Frederick B. Cohen" -- then he's
probably a very busy fellow. I wonder who he is at AT&T?
Yes.  He is worthwhile from what I have seen.
He has said that he will probably be consulted at AT&T if there is ever
any type of Internet issue.  I'm not sure if that makes him one of AT&T's
Internet consultants or whether he is one of the responsible persons at
AT&T.  But I'd rather let Steve speak for himself on that. I don't know if Steve has the explicit authority to have the Chairman take
his call as an example and I doubt that -- on his pen -- a full Board
Meeting could be convened to bring all opinions forward to the table, so
that those who are CHARGED with decision making CAN make decisions. I think he probably has to go through channels. (Direct access to senior management is generally part and parcel of any functioning security policy.  It has to be.  And I assume that AT&T does have one.)
I'm slowly working through my mail queue, and will probably reply soon to
Steve's email.  It's flagged.  And I can probably ask at that time whether
he DOES read this list, and settle the issue. I really don't want to bother him though with trivial questions and
comments when he's probably busy forming an inter-departmental Working
Group to *carefully* deal with the Netscape issue -- a large committee to
focus on the problem that blindsided AT&T, a committee to focus on
deployment strategies.  I assume that that's why Steve's not posting to
this list and providing free entertaining content to Internet subscribers. He's probably too DAMNED busy.  (And not getting paid NEARLY enough ;)
I hope that AT&T's Netscape Security Audit Working Group's first order of
business is to elect one person to deal with external email, rather than
having each individual employee from AT&T send, _yours truly_ a "Me Too"
... "I'm responsible"  ... "this is MY turf" reply.  But that's not a list
discussion so I'll take it off-line where it belongs, and keep Perry
as happy as I can.)
That discussion ... the "everyone at AT&T is responsible" one, belongs
with the Netscape one ... the one where "no one at Netscape is
responsible", the one where "nobody from Netscape ever replies" to your
email. Alice de 'nonymous ...

@_subject: Re: Java insecurity - long - argumentative - you are warned. 
I don't think that this is *bullshit* ... the questions I mean ... but,
I for one am tired of people promoting products in a manner which flies in direct contravention of expert consensus.
No one would accept a pharmaceutical company that says a product is X, if it is in fact Y.  And no one would question if a researcher came forward, and corrected the company and set the record straight.
This is generally called ETHICS ... not bullshit.  The problem is not in the messenger, it's in the organization that is simply willing to roll the dice when it comes to public safety and security.
I've got a better suggestion.  Why don't companies like Sun ensure that their sales and technical material is reviewed for gross inaccuracies and/or misrepresentations?
I won't speak for Dr. Frederick B. Cohen, but I will speak for myself,
and provide this list with but a single example.  And I won't quote
from a white paper, but will instead quote from some Sun literature
which crossed my desk the day before yesterday, literature that Sun
provided as part of their worldwide introduction of Ultra workstations.
What they called a "breakthrough for network computing".
What follows is not "technical commentary", but is simply what they
provide as information to MIS managers, Sun resellers and invited
press. This copyrighted brochure, which looks like it was printed
11/95 makes the following verbatim comment on the "Java Internet
Application Language".
Hmmm, maybe I'm confused, but this is grossly overselling a product's
capabilities, and is setting absolutely unrealistic expectations --
expectations which are doomed from the start never to be met, let
alone exceeded.  This expectations/satisfaction gap will ultimately
lead to customer dis-satisfaction.
Then again ... the solution to virus-free, tamper-free systems with
TCP/IP protocol "coping" has always been a problem that's been waiting
for a "product solution" to help all of us to enable our programmers.
God help us all.
As part of my copious spare time, I might make a personal comment
which hopefully gets to some of the powers that be at Sun.
Firstly, I wasn't aware that HTTP was a TCP/IP protocol.  I didn't
even think that there was a draft RFC on it.  I thought that all that
there was, was an internet-draft, which is a different kettle of fish.
I never realized that HTTP was on standards track, and part of the
appliction protocol.  It really is news to me.  But that's a quibble,
and I'm really behind on my reading, so, I could be wrong.
My second comment is perhaps more actionable.  I would much rather
that a product clearly and definitively state what it has implemented.
Maybe something like the following.
Implementation of the following IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)
protocols :IP (RFCs 791, 894; MIL-STD 1777); UDP (RFC 768); TCP (RFC
793, MIL-STD 1778); ARP (RFC 826); RARP (RFC 903); ICMP (RFC 792);
BootP (RFCs 951, 1048); RIP (IDEA004); DNS (RFCs 1034, 1035); Internet
Subnetting (RFC 950); and Internet Assigned Numbers (RFC 1010). Maybe,
also that the product complies with Requirements for Internet Hosts
Communications Layers (RFC 1122) and with A Standard for the
Transmission of IP Datagrams over IEEE 802 Networks (RFC 10..
something or other).
This is far more informative (ironically) than saying that:
Hmmm, FTP.  That's RFC 7?? or something like that, isn't it?? As an example, I'd like to know how Java handles a file, that is called
foo.bar.au.  Does a .au file refer to an audio file, or does it refer to
something from Australia??  I'll stop here, and not continue with my deconstruction, especially
the part that continues:
To every problem, a product solution ... we can leave mathematician's
at the door, and simply enable our programmers.
Those technical analyst rocket scientist types, really can't know
anything, at all.  Can they?

Hmmm, Peter actually has me worried.  I actually _understood_ what he was
talking about.  And that has me worried.
I guess that reviewing all that LIBOR financing documentation over ten
years ago, when I was extending a helping hand to the CIBC helped.  No one
should ever attempt to figure out what happens when you have an American
highrise owned by a private Canadian citizen, go into receivership with a
syndicated Euro-financing while attempting a head lease to AT&T. An experience like that leaves you scarred for life.  You actually learn to grok "lawyer speak".
I guess that an interesting follow up occurs, if I perhaps muddy the chrystal clear waters of Peter's analysis.  It relates to another thread on this list, the thread on time-release crypto and the economics of information.  A hypothetical which might clarify by making things murky.
If I ... as a foreign citizen ... a Canadian ... were to release an
algorithm for time-release crypto to another Canadian ... another
foreigner, could I actually be hauled down by the scruff of my neck to
face US style "justice".  Could I be deprived of our Canadian traditions of Napoleonic Code and of British Common Law, to face Americanism's.
Does anyone from State have any clarification of this policy-shift??
I find it ridiculous to hear that if I load a series of messages into a
fax machine, and instruct that machine to send out a series of documents
at some set point in time -- and that if I were to *communicate* this
method of time delay cryptographically secure communication to another
Canadian citizen, that I could actually be hauled out of my own country
and dragged across an international border to face charges of treason against a state to which I have no allegiance. This would be laughable, if it weren't so sinister.  I mean, it's only a FAX machine ... for goodness sake's.
Here I am as a Canadian citizen, a citizen of a sovereign State, a state
which has historically been a friend of the American people.  A State
which has actually sacrificed its own international stature and the
security of its citizens, to benefit Americans.  (Most notably, when
Canada rescued the hostages in Iran) and America repays the citizens of
Ambassador Ken Taylor's home town how??  With an implied threat of making
them subject to US law because its administratively convenient? Can't anyone find acts of treason, a little closer to home??
Domestically maybe ... possibly even right under your nose ...

@_subject: Re: DejaNews all over again 
Expert", from Netscape Communications: I think "Jeff" ... Mr. unofficial not speakng for the company Netscape
spokesperson, I think that you should rethink what you're suggesting. Your tactics won't serve your personal interests on this one.  I really
would recommend that you come clean.  This is not about "gloating".  I really take very little pleasure in this.
It's really not a good plan, to suggest that I contravene your "license
agreement" or break the laws of my country to satisfy some ego-centred
game on your part not to face the FACT, that you have been caught. Not arrested yet, but you have been found out.
Or as I wrote some weeks ago, in some oddly inspired flash ... You're
"Hoist by your own 'petar" ... (which is a quote that Johnnie Cochrane
used during the OJ trial ... a quote taken from Shakespeare which
*translated* means that you've been blown up by your own bomb.)
I am not nearly so *SLOW* as to offer you ammunition to use against me.
Your license agreement -- pardon me -- Netscape's license agreement
explicitly sets out the limitations underwhich I must function.  An agreement, I respect.  It states in part. Ya see ... "Jeff" ... I actually respect that ... and I'll operate within
those constraints on this one.  Later the Agreement continues with more
legalistic boiler plate and says,
Now how do you expect me ... poor little "Alice" ... to exploit KNOWN
documented and undocumented security holes in Netscape Navigator ... holes
which Netscape willfully and deliberately or alternatively through the
grossest of negligence, engineered into the product, when I have
implicitly agreed not to violate your License Agreement. My hands are kindof tied, aren't they "Jeff".  I need written permission to do that, and considerring that Netscape
hasn't even *bothered* to acknowledge email which was sent to them, email
which asked whether they will voluntarily open up their experimental MIME
objects to IETF review, I somehow doubt that permission will be
forthcoming. You can't suck and blow at the same time Jeff. Maybe, what I'll do ... is snail mail Netscape and ask for explicit
permission to do just that.  I'll also ask for access to all of the source
code, and maybe at the same time ask for the email address of Dr James H.
Clark, since the Netscape postmaster doesn't seem to reply to email.
Afterall, he DOES know about this issue, doesn't he??  Dr. James H. Clark has been briefed, I hope ...
Let's see ... Dr. James H Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics Inc, and co-founder of Netscape Communications Corp. does know about this "itsy bitsy" "teeny-weeny" problem doesn't he??  I mean there _will_ be questions as to what he knew and when he knew it and
what he did about it.  But that'll be his baby ... and I'll let him speak for himself on that one. But the other question ... the question of what the other co-founder of
Netscape Communications Corp., Marc Andreessen, knew is not a subject for speculation.  We know that.
Marc Andreessen, vice-president of technology at Netscape, and creator of NCSA Mosaic's knowledge is clear.  We "know" what Marc knew. Marc won't be able to pull an "Ollie North" and redact the public domain
electronic archives.  It's clear what he knew and when he knew it. A simple one line command tells all ... a command like, maybe:
           mget rfc* |grep Andreessen
run at one of the public domain archives might give us some clues and
pointers to anyone who might be familiar with how the net works.  Then a
little follow up and search of some mailing lists ... lists of the
Internet Engineering Task Force ... cross-referencing the records of the
IETF might tell us what Marc knew and when. NOTHING which has been written, is gone, is it Jeff??  There are no hidden
acts, and there are no solitary acts when it comes to the Network.  And isn't that a shame, "Jeff"??
But then what would I know about such things ... I don't *understand* the technology, do I "Jeff", my boy??
Simple question, once again ... does Netscape have any comment to make?  Or does it continue to say "no comment".  Will Dr. James H. Clark, and/or Marc Andreessen please step forward and address this issue at this time?  The international community is beginning to loose its patience.

@_subject: Re: Market Value of Web Pages 
Actually, Tim, there are many examples we each could think of.
As an example, I'm presently preparing an unsolicited Security Review
report for a Fortune 500 company.  It's *priced* if you will in the mid
five figure range per page (and that includes the title page, the
appendices, and the pages which say on them, "this page left intentionally
blank"). (It's the short report ... the one which references RFC's rather than
including them.  The report that includes RFC's is priced significantly
lower when measured by weight ... i.e. cost/page metering.)
But the report's information value is truly *worth* a factor many, many
hundreds of times what the invoice rate bears or what the cost per page
would indicate.  For me, my current report is in fact a loss leader. Since my report IS unsolicited, I really don't even have any real
expectation that the invoice will be approved for payment.  My invoice is
not submitted on that basis.  I realize that I might not even receive
re-imbursement for my out-of-pocket expenses. The beneficiary might well think that the information is only worth the
value of a promotional mug or of a promo T-shirt, or maybe even worthless. Alternatively, the company might offer a complementary copy of their
product or even just info-freeload as Netscape did with those Berkeley
hombre stud-muffins, some time ago. But the information within my unsolicited report is hopefully utilized
none the less, no matter what financial consideration is extended, because
the information is _actually_ priceless, even though the recipient might
consider that information to have only a nominal or "no, or little
compensable value". Information is interesting that way.
Because information is/was provided to them "freely" most firms will
not (generally) see any value in the information at all.  They happily
become information free-loaders.  It's paradoxical and ironic in an information age.
The huge bill I send out is, literally, the reality check.
No honest person would expect to take a dress home from a shop without
paying, but a lot of normally honest folk don't give a thought to taking
an armload of free information.  Which I guess is an interesting segueway
into a basic briefing on "information value" theory. But that part will have to hold for a bit ... once I collect my thoughts
on how information philistines and information connoisseurs have differing
value judgments.  The implications might surprise people.

SIDEWAYS AND WHY WE NOW HAVE A BRAND SPANKING NEW CHIEF OF POLICE.
A REAL CUTEY, TOO!!  MIGHT EVEN EXPLAIN WHY THE PARTY LINE.
MAYBE YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT SOME OF THE NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY RESEARCH
THAT WAS HAPPENING WAAAAY, WAAAY BACK WHEN ...  LIKE MAYBE, A COUPLE
OF RECOMBINANT DNA EXPERIMENTS I WAS ASSISTING WITH WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN
... MAYBE EVEN THE EXPERIMENTS THAT LEAD TO AN UNSCHEDULED RELEASE OF
BIO-ACTIVE MATERIAL??
OOPS ... E. COLI, EH?
NAAAH, WE'LL ALL SHADDUP 'BOUT ALL THAT.  BUT I WONDER WHAT THAT
MULTICS WAS DOING IN SOME FOREIGN COUNTRY.  YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT THAT
ITAR OR SOMESUCH WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE EXPORT TO A BUNCHA
FOREIGNERS, NO??
WE'RE CANADIEN, EH??  WE'RE JUST LIKE YANKEES, CEPT WE WEAR TOQUES AND
PLAY HOCKEY ... AND WE'LL JUST ROLL OVER AND CEDE OUR OURSELVES TO
THAT SOUTHERN ELEPHANT THAT WE LIVE RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO.
MAYBE YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER I MOVED FROM THE
DANGEROUS BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES TO SOMETHING BENIGN, LIKE
COMPUTERS AND NETWORKS.  WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE NON-SCHEDULED RELEASE
OF BIO-ACTIVE MATERIAL, OF HOW I INITIALLY GOT INTRO'D.
MAYBE THAT'LL HELP YOU SMELL THE SMOKE??
OK ... IF IT'LL HELP, 1'LL TELL YOU STUFF 'BOUT ME, SO YOU CAN JUDGE
MY "SO CALLED" CREDENTIALS ...
FROM AGE FIFTEEN, AFTER THE UNSCHEDULED RELEASE, I WAS "MENTORRED" BY
ONE OF THE TOP SECURITY EXPERTS, ONE OF THE BEST OF THE FIELD, A MAN
WHO I STILL HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR AND SOMEONE WHO I AM
UNFORTUNATELY NOT ANY LONGER IN CONTACT WITH.  SOMEONE WHO IN SOME
WEIRD AND WARPED WAY IS ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING IT ALL HAPPEN.
(BUT THEN AGAIN, HE WENT TO THE BRONX SCHOOL OF SCIENCE ... I THINK)
AND THAT EXPLAINS NOTHING AND EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME.
(HE'S PRETTY BALD NOW, TOO ... GUESS I DIDN'T JUST MAKE HIS HAIR GREY,
HE PROBABLY ENDED UP TEARING MOST OF IT OUT BY THE HANDFUL.)
OOPS, I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT ...
ANY MORE CLUES??
HMMM, HOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER DROPPING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I
WAS SEVENTEEN AND LEAVING THE VAX AND MULTICS AND PUNCHED CARDS BEHIND
AND GOING TO WORK ON THE FIRST NCR IMPLEMENTATION OF DEBIT CARDS AND
THE CREATION OF THE FIRST ATM NETWORK.
WOULD THAT HELP??  IMPLEMENTATION OF AN OFFLINE NON-NETWORKED ATM NETWORK?  I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE A CASH REGISTER COMPANY MIGHT HAVE WORKED ON E-CASH BACK IN THE LATE SEVENTIES AND EARLY EIGHTIES, OR SOMETHING.
OOPS, MORE CLUES ... GOTTA STOP POSTING THOSE CLUES ... (IF I KEEPA POSTING CLUES, THEY MIGHT FIGURE OUT THAT ALL PUBLIC
INFORMATION IS INHERENTLY DISINFORMATION, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.)
OK ... HOW 'BOUT THIS ... HOW ABOUT WHEN I TRIED TO RUN FOR THE DOORS
WHEN THE PROJECT ABANDONNED NCR FOR THE ATM NETWORK AND EXPECTED MOI TO LEARN CICS AND JCL. HEE-BEE JEE-BEES ... JCL ... IT'S ENOUGH FOR ANYONE TO RUN FOR THE DOORS.  LEFT MY OWN PERSONAL
LITTLE MINI AT MY DESK, MY OWN LITTLE FIEFDOM, IN THE CAPABLE HANDS OF
A COUPLE OF TECHIES AND LEFT THE BIG BLUE CONVERSION IN THE
SEMI-CAPABLE HANDS OF SOME ASSOCIATES FROM DMR (I THINK), AND GOT THE
HECK OUTTA THE FIELD.
SORTA ... KINDA ...
IS THIS GONNA MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT THE VODKA IS FLOWING, BUT THE MEAT
IS ROTTEN??  PROBABLY NOT.
IS IT GONNA MAKE YOU STOP HOLDING YOUR NOSE??  COLOUR ME, DOUBTFUL. LET'S JUST SAY THAT I TIRED OF THE NONSENSE AND TOOK A BREATHER.
MAYBE IT WAS THAT FATEFUL DAY WHEN MANAGEMENT QUESTIONED WHY I HADN'T
SHAVED FOR THE MORNING MANAGEMENT BRIEFING -- THE MORNING MEETING WITH
THE DOUGHNUTS, BRIGHT AND EARLY AT EIGHT.  I HAD THE TEMERITY TO APPEAR HALF-SHAVEN AND HALF-BAKED AFTER
HANDHOLDING THE NETWORK THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT, THE DAY, AND ANOTHER
NIGHT.  I WAS SPACED AND MESSY.
BUT IT WAS A DEFINING MOMENT.  WHILE THOSE CAFETERIA BENCHES MADE GREAT BEDS IN A PINCH, AND WHILE
YOU COULD ALWAYS SPONGE BATH IN THE EXECUTIVE BATHROOM.  IT GOT TO BE
OVERWHELMING AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS AT THE OFFICE.
AND IT WAS MY MISTAKE.  MY OVERSIGHT.  MAKE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.
I SUPPOSE MANAGEMENT WAS RIGHT, NO OFFICE EMPLOYEE SHOULD EVER STUMBLE
UPON CRO-MAGNON MAN STANDING NUDE IN THE JOHN.  NO ONE REASONABLY
EXPECTS TO BE CONFRONTED BY DONKEY KONG.  ESPECIALLY DURING
STANDARD:DAYLIGHT TIME CONVERSION WHEN MR ROCKET SCIENTIST FORGETS TO
CHANGE A WRISTWATCH AND BARES ALL, THINKING THAT EIGHT IS SEVEN, AND
IS SURPRISED!!
OOPS ... IS IT REALLY GONNA HELP MY CREDENTIALS ANY, IF I TALK ABOUT BEING
CAUGHT WITH MY PANTS DOWN??  OR EXPLAINING WHY I HADN'T SHAVED FOR THE
MORNING BRIEFING??  OR DE-BRIEFING, AS THE CASE MAY BE.
LET'S JUST SAY THAT I LEFT THE FIELD ...
OR ... MAYBE ... MAYBE ... SOME QUICK DAMAGE CONTROL ... MAYBE, WE HAD
DIFFERING VISIONS OF SYSTEMS -- MANAGEMENT AND I -- YEAH THAT'S THE
TICKET -- MAYBE I "ACCIDENTLY" LEANED AGAINST THE WALL AFTER
MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTED THEIR OWN DRESS POLICY ... I MEAN HOW DANGEROUS
COULD AN IMPLEMENTED DRESS POLICY BE??
"IT'S ONLY A DRESS POLICY," THEY SAID.
I SUPPOSE THE SUGGESTION THAT TROUSERS *MUST* BE WORN AT ALL TIMES WAS
REASONABLE ... AND IN HINDSIGHT ... I SUPPOSE I SHOULDN'T HAVE
"ACCIDENTALLY" DUMPED THE HALON WHEN THEY SUGGESTED THAT BOW-TIES WERE
NOT APPROPRIATE CORPORATE ATTIRE AT A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION -- THAT
THEY *SHOULDN'T* BE WORN.  THAT WAS ALL OK.  I THINK WHAT FINALLY MADE
ME SNAP WAS WHEN THEY SUGGESTED THAT I ... AND EVERYONE ELSE ...
SHOULD NOT ONLY *ALWAYS* WEAR TROUSERS AND *NEVER* BOW-TIES, BUT THAT
WE *MUST* WEAR A "NORMAL" TIE AT ALL TIMES AND BE A GOOD LIL BIO-UNIT.
MAYBE IT WAS THE DIRECT ORDERS TO WEAR ONE OF THOSE FLOPPY DANGLY
THINGS AROUND MY NECK WHEN I WAS AROUND THE LINE PRINTERS ... BEING
ORDERED TO WEAR IT THAT DID IT.  OR MAYBE, IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE
ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT.
WHO KNOWS??  BUT THE BOTTOM LINE WAS THAT I WAS OFF TO JOIN THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF
FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT.  THE NOOSE HAD WON, I *WOULD* WEAR IT, AND I
COULD KEEP MY PANTS -- AT ALL TIMES -- WHERE THEY TRULY BELONGED.
ARE THESE THE CREDENTIALS, THAT YOU'RE AFTER??
THE ONES THAT WILL MAKE THE WORLD STOP SPINNING, AND SLOW DOWN AND
LISTEN ... WHEN SOMEONE SCREAMS FIRE IN A CROWDED THEATRE?  AND ASKS
THAT THE NETWORK BE TAKEN DOWN FOR SECURITY REASONS?  OR, ALTERNATELY THAT A PARTICULAR INSTALLED CODE BASE BE REMOVED, BECAUSE IT IS EVIL INCARNATE??
PROBABLY NOT ... IT DOESN'T ADD ANYTHING TO MY PROFILE AT ALL. MAYBE, WHAT MIGHT HELP IS SOMETHING MORE SIMPLE.  AFTER LEAVING THE
BIO-SCIENCES FOR SOMETHING SAFER, AND THEN THE COMPUTER SCIENCES, AND
THEN ULTIMATELY LEAVING FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT.  WHAT WAS LEFT FOR A
BIOUNIT TO DO.
BUT THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE STORY OF HOW -- THANKS TO SOME POLISH
MATHEMATICIAN -- I DRIFTED OVER INTO PURE MATHEMATICS AFTER BECOMING A
SEMI-RETIRED SLUMLORD IN MY EARLY TWENTIES, AND AN OCCASIONAL

THINGS.  A SYSTEMS-DECONSTRUCTIONIST.
RACCONTEUR, BON-VIVANT, AND A RENAISSANCE MAN ARE SOME OF LABELS
HURLED MY WAY IN SCURRILLOUS ATTACKS.  FIGHTING WORDS.

HE'S A RUSH ... THIS MORNING'S DILBERT WAS A REAL H00T ... TEN-DOLLAR BONUS FOR BUG-FREE SOFTWARE ... *POSH* ... I MEAN WHERE DOES THIS SCOTT GUY GET HIS MATERIAL??  YAHOO!!  AND YIPPEE KI YAY!!

I haven't picked up the paper and looked at the article.  Once in a blue
moon, I might pick up the International Herald Tribune, but only on the
rarest of rare circumstances, but this worries me.  And it really should worry everyone who might have some interest in harm
reduction. If someone in the Business Section of the New York Times is writing as you
say -- writing that shipping a credit card number UNENCRYPTED over the
Internet is no less secure than giving it out over the phone, then we have
a SERIOUS communications/understanding gap to overcome. It seems like not only the NY Times, but the "You Will" folk at AT&T don't
quite "get" it.  (The AT&T swipe, is for the idjit that sent me email on
postcard via bucket brigade, and then asked me to please keep it
A simple understanding is necessary if we're going to use this snazzy new technology, and not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  An understanding that the NY Times, or its *experts* don't seem to A telephone connection goes from one point to another.  It's like a football pass.  An internet connection is different, it's like an old fashioned bucket brigade.
Now, if you were to write a message on a football, and throw it, while
their is a "risk" of inteception you can be reasonably certain that the
message on the ball will be "reasonably" safe while flying through the air.  This is the phone call "football" analogy..
The net however does not establish a direct connection like a telephone
call.  It works like the old "bucket brigade" of volunteer fire
departments.  Your message is handed off -- handed to the next person in a
chain, who then hands it to the next, and so on. Your "message" (or credit card number) is effectively written on a
postcard and passed around from person to person, before it gets to your
final destination.  This makes it completely different than the telephone
call.  Orders of magnitude different.
So here's the question ... and here's the comparison.  Would you, if you
were in New York, buy something with your credit card using the following
payment method. Would you, write your credit card number on the back of a postcard, and
leave it with your neighbour, with instructions to give to the doorman,
who's supposed to flag a cabbie and tell him to take it to a building, to
then give it to another doorman, who will leave it with the business next
door to give to the person or business that you want to have your credit
card number?? Why not??  Does this strike any reader as something really silly??  Because, this is actually the way the Internet works.  This is exactly how
any message, whether its your email, or your credit card number gets from
Point A to Point B.  A message that is going from one computer, even to
one just down the block, might end up going through twenty or third
"hands" before being delivered. This is what makes the Internet rather unsafe, far more unsafe than a
telephone call.  And this lack of understanding, the lack of understanding
in the press is what makes the Internet even unsafer.  It is people being very cavalier.
Many people trust the NY Times to "get it right", then again, the  investor
also trusts that these companies actually know what they're doing. The public deserves better.
If this is the "intelligent media coverage", then how on earth are they
going to be able to cover "taking down" the Internet for some repairs?? And how are they gonna cover the inevitable, Internet crime of the
century? Alice de 'nonymous ...

@_author: such as in Netscape 
@_subject: Re: credit card conventional wisdom 
Actually, this is not quite correct.  There is a difference if I give a
credit card to *one* person, or if I give the message containing that
number to a chain of twenty or thirty strangers to get my information to
the one person I want to have that information. We're back to handing your card to the neighbour, who gives it to the doorman, who flags the cab and gives it to a cabbie, who then drives cross town and gives it to another doorman, who then etc, etc.
Something completely different than the long bomb from the quarterback.
Our potential interception points have increased substantially ... and we
have absolutely no audit trail to figure out who *might* have scarfed the
card. I guess the average customer won't care.  His loss is limited to $50.
But some of us who try to live in the real world wonder how long that'll
last.  Can we measure the life of it in a matter of weeks??  Or months? Hmmm ... maybe we'll even get a whole whole new industry going ... don't
ya think??  Maybe we can create a whole new set of risks which are
additive to those we already have.  Maybe every petty grifter might trade
in his very own credit card number and simply claim that their credit card
got stolen over the internet. Just disappeared into the anonymous aethyr ... the one without an audit
trail ... but my loss is limited to $50, right??
I guess other people understand systems much, much, more than I do.  I
guess that the NY Times is right ... it won't change the loss rate for the
card companies, at all ... nope ... won't create a new problem ... naahh
... the public wouldn't actually take advantage of holes like this in the
system. Nope, no sirreee ...  Give your head a shake.

@_subject: Re: Netscape rewards are an insult 
Alice here ...
I know that this is *painfully* dated, and I apologize to the list for
replying to a one month old post, but I felt I had to put some final items
on the record.  And I think that this is still timely ... so ... Dr. Frederick B. Cohen has nailed it once again.  He's right. But Phil's comments really need to be addressed ... vis-a-vis the
implications of "discovering a hole and selling it".  Phil's hypothetical
is rightfully worrisome, but we should remember it _is_ only a
hypothetical. Let's not worry much about hypotheticals.  Perhaps we should worry more
about what in fact IS an ACTUAL, rather than what might possibly be. The hand-wringing should be over the existing reactions to publicly
ignored security holes and the ETHICS of the new Internet players.  The ones who are so very cock-sure of themselves.  So cock-sure, that
they willingly gamble with public security and think that their invasion
of individuals personal boundaries and privacy is nothing noteworthy. That it will just somehow pass. My post detailing a structural flaw in Netscape Navigator was announced,
very quietly, to this list OVER ONE MONTH AGO.  And what has been done
about it, by AT&T and/or Netscape??  Nothing. AT&T has its reputation attached to this code, as does Deutsche Telecom,
as does Netscape.  The only "action" they've taken is to info-freeload and
then do absolutely, positively, definitely ... nothing. No one has taken any action whatsoever.
How would we treat a company ... let's say a construction company that
found out that one of its buildings was unsafe, and then proceeded not to
barricade the complex.  If the company found out that the girders were not
up to the engineered spec, and simply allowed risk and harm to continue. If the Company thought it was OK to gamble with people's lives?  Would we
say that the reckless disregard for the public interest merited criminal
sanction?? Hopefully, we would.
To attack some hypothetical "information provider" for selling some
"hypothetical" information which a corporation denies is actually of any
value, at all -- nominal, or otherwise -- is an argument that just doesn't
float.  It completely misses the mark. They should definitely take the product off the market.    Period.  They should also stop claiming that it offers any security.  In fact, they
should attach a product warning label, something that says that Netscape
Navigator degrades your inherent safety and security as soon as you use
it. That would be the "right thing" to do.  Because that is truthful.
AT&T's "brass" should have used the "Tylenol" or "Perrier" crisis
management model on this one.  Rather than, "The stick your head in the
sand like an ostrich" model.  Or the "Gee, maybe if I close my eyes, and pull the covers over my head, the boogie-man will go away" school. Someone has to call them on their collective jump into the World of
Management by Denial.
The issue here isn't the so-called "reward", the focus should rightly be
placed on who knew what and when they knew it, and what they did as a
consequence.  The issue is whether these Goliath Companies, happily roll
the dice when public safety and security is on the line. It's that simple.  A real no brainer.
Actually, they said that they want to "harness" the power of the internet,
and in return offered a chance to be enrolled in a contest for a mug or a
T-shirt, or maybe ... if they ... in "their sole discretion" thought
something was a security bug, then they'd offer a $1,000 award. Not *pestering* security experts, but simply asking them to sorta, kinda
take a look at the product.  Look, and help build the Companies' fortunes,
while the "Creative" talent might get a nice Netscape mug for their
troubles. This is what Netscape DID, but this isn't the true issue.
The true issue is a question of attitudes, not of monetary compensation. I
really don't care if Netscape or AT&T offer gold stars and nice little
pats on the head, or offer many "millions" or offer $25,000, or expect the
world's foremost security auditors to work for T-shirts or a bitta
Crackerjack. That's not the issue.
I just don't believe that any company should on the one hand represent
that they have a secure product -- that they actually care about security
 -- while on the other hand they take their black-box code and say that
anyone who brings an error to their attention -- a critical security flaw
 -- agrees implicitly to make the report the Company's property -- property
to be used at the Company's sole discretion. A security review audit is first and foremost for the benefit of the end
users.  The audit is not so that the company can use the information for
its own purposes.  The information is not there so that the company can
use a confidential auditor's report on security flaws to spy on their own
customers, and its certainly not there to enable a code cover-up.
Hell, these firms try to cover up even when the information is PUBLIC, let
alone when it's given to them in private.  And the crying and whining is unbecoming, because the attempt at private communication was made.
It was made with both Netscape, and with AT&T.
You're right.  the people who find the bugs simply ask that the public
interest be served ... that the Network's interest be served, and that the
National interest be served. Defective product serves no one, and adding an object to an existing
computing environment under the rubric of an experimental data type serves
no-one.  Correction, it serves no-one except those who would rather see
harm come to the public. Those who value and place their own self-interest
above that of others. And the consequnces be damned.
The ironic part is that even once a critical design flaw is identified, no
action is taken by anyone -- even when the person who finds it demands no
money whatsoever for it -- the real irony is that the press is silent, and
so is the company. See no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil.
Let the harm and damage continue ... by my calculation, it's been one
month already ... shall we maybe try now for two?? I don't think so. Alice de 'nonymous ...

@_author: sorry the online newscasts were rather vague 
@_subject: Re: CSE gets flak on TV 
Hmm, actually the news tape is reading a little strange here in Canada.
Not AP, or REUTERS, but simply the Canadian Press newswire.
Let's see ... over the last couple of days, we've had one provincial
Premier resign over "BingoGate" -- kickbacks from bingo games, another
premier is under some pretty heavy fire for some insider trading in a
company he promoted in Hong Kong, (actually his wife got stock she never
had to pay for), while Canada in conjunction with the normally very
neutral Swiss have frozen accounts pertaining to about $20 million or so
in kickbacks from Airbus Industries to a "senior Canadian politician". And all these stories ... coincidentally ... broke back to back.
It's almost as though the country is disinfecting itself, or has taken one particularly powerful laxative.
But the CSE story is really, really smelly.  The worst of the whole lot. I think that there might be more to this than appears on the surface. Maybe filling in some details might help our friends on this list.
You listening, Perry???
              *             *            *
No big secret??  It was news to me. ;-)
Wark actually continued here.  He said:  "I don't know what a friendly
power in the economic sphere is, exactly, these days.  That seems to be a
very ambiguous term."
(Of course, this is diplo-dodo-speak for something ... I think ... but I'm not sure what.)
There was also a followup segment, broadcast Monday.  I think that "Jane
Shorten" said that the CSE intercepted telephone conversations and faxes
of Canadians working at FOREIGN embassies in Canada.
But Prime Minister Chretien, in ... New Zealand ... at a meeting of the
Commonwealth did not deny Canada is spying on allies, but he did say that
"This is an organization that works within the law of Canada". He also said, "They do not report to me on a daily basis and I cannot make
any comments on if they are spying on anybody.  I don't know.  But they
have the mandate to check a few things around the world.  Probably
somebody is listening to us at this moment." Later the Prime Minister said that if any laws have been broken, "somebody
will have to pay the price." Ottawa maintains that the CSE, the NSA and their counterparts in Britain, Australia, and New Zealand have all agreed not to spy on each other.  He also said that the CSE does not target Canadians and scrupulously abides by Canadian laws.
"Jane Shorten" said in her Sunday broadcast, "I have lived with this information for so long and I just think that it is time that Canada knows what the CSE is doing."
"Shorten" worked as an analyst for the CSE from 1986 to 1994 when she was
laid off.  "Shorten" said that the agency spied on Canada's allies and
trading partners, eavesdropping on friendly embassies, consulates, and
diplomats in Canada and around the world. Ottawa denies it.  "Countries like Canada have understandings that they don't carry out these
activities against each other."  Solicitor General Herb Gray said earlier
this year in response to claims that the US Central Intelligence Agency
had spied on the Japanese delegation during auto trade talks in Geneva. "Shorten" however replied:  "He does not know what's going on because CSE
is certainly doing that ... I spied on the (South) Korean government for
the Canadian government." [I think she was referring to Atomic Energy of Canada's sale of nuclear power plants ... possibly ... but I don't know, about AECL.]
Today, it was reported by the deupty prime minister -- since the Prime
Minister is away at an economic conference in Japan -- that there will be
a review of operations to make sure that the Communications Security
Establishment is obeying the law. "And if, in fact, there has been illegal activity going on, we'll want to deal with that in as public a way as possible," said Sheila Copps.
The Mexican government has presented a diplomatic note to Canada
expressing "surprise and concern" over the report that it was spied on
during the North American free-trade talks. South Korea is looking into the matter as well. The head of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association wants an independent
committee to oversee CSE operations.  Alan Bovoroy, angered by the
suggestions of spying on Canadians, said a watchdog could put pressure on
politicians to make changes if the CSE steps over the line. International diplomacy experts said the allegations of economic espionage
wouldn't damage Ottawa's relations with the countries.                       --  E N D --
And I guess ... that's all of the news that I've got to this hour.  Except
for one brief note, that Prime Minister Chretien tried to call the States,
but the Government shutdown meant that his call couldn't get through.  I think he tried to call NASA.
Speaking personally, I just think that something is a bit fishy. I mean "Jane Shorten" is a nym if I ever heard one ... probably married to
"Dick Lengthen" or something.  But putting my wry sense of haha, aside there are some serious questions.
How does someone cleared for TOP SECRET UMBRA, like our dear "Jane
Shorten" say, "I have lived with this information for so long and I just
think that it is time that Canada knows what CSE is doing."  And then
later say:  "I feel so strongly that its time that people learned what CSE
is all about." I mean ... HELLO .... GiGGle TesT ... what on earth did she think the CSE did?? Made snowmen and skated on the Rideau Canal??
"Shorten" apparently is quite distraught, over the stepped up CSE
operations in 1991.  Operations targetted at foreign embassies in Canada.
She recalled overhearing conversations of Canadians employed there -- even
one woman's phone call to her doctor.  She was appalled and confronted her
boss, who assured her that the practice was legal. I mean, whop dee doo ... "Shorten" overheard a patient/doctor telephone
call that a Canadian made from their place of work -- a foreign embassy.
Did she listen with great intent and intererst, or did she simply try not
to listen??  If "Shorten" was so disraught at listening in on personal
information, she should have closed her ears.  I mean, this is Canada,
what is the problem if we listen to people who work in embassies?? The agency IS obligated to destroy information about Canadians it scoops up in its electronic net.  A rare exception might be a phone call describing a terrorist plot, but that would truly be exceptional, I think.
I mean its not like one big fishing expedition. In any event, "Jane Shorten" returned to Canada from New York, this last
evening.  She told CTV she was aware her revelations could result in

Alice here ...
My grandfather used to say, that the first horse to break from the gate,
isn't necessarily the first to cross the finish line. Often, he'll be pulling up the rear.
In my humble opinion, the present system can't really be characterized as
"working perfectly well".  Far from it.  While not as familiar with the US system as the Canadian, I can give as a
simple example, the bank clearing system for paper checks.  In Canada, we
can clear a check from one side of the country to the other overnight.  We
have 24 hour clearing.  While this is far from "perfect", our existing
paper systems allow for a degree of efficiency which I don't believe is
engineered into the US clearing system. Perhaps someone can correct me, if I have erred but I think it takes far
longer than 24 hours to clear a check drawn on any US bank, and deposited
to any other bank's credit in the United States.  It may work
"functionally" ... but certainly far from "perfectly" nor "efficiently". A very good point.  But then, dumpster-diving attacks could be moderated
by simply implementing carbonless forms.  No carbon, reduces a lot of the
risks.  It's basic risk management. All of this becomes a part of the cost/benefit analysis, and is part of
the function of security policy.  It's very much like all the talk on
another thread on this list about Java security. There is no point in even discussing Java security in Netscape, when
Netscape PRESENTLY has existing security holes written into the very
fabric of the existing installed codebase.  Holes which Netscape and AT&T
refuse to address, correct or even comment on. Sun's security approach misses the point.  Putting dead-bolts on houses
while leaving all of the windows open, just doesn't address the problem. It really misses the mark. This is also unfortunately true.  Information on how to "break" a system
does propagate.  As more people know how to exploit a system, or as more
people learn how to utilize the "letter of the rules" (the "code") rather
than the "spirit" (the "intent") the degree of exploitation grows. Ask any executive in the Gaming Industry about this.
Black-Jack card-counting went through an evolution in exactly this
fashion.  Many casinos lost a veritable "fortune" to good card counters. They lost to organized "teams" of card counters.  Counters who literally
broke the bank. Systems always have exploitable features.  And new systems will always
present new opportunities for exploitation. A completely new set of risks
which are additive to those already in place, even those which may not yet be in a state of active exploitation.
A pertinent network example: credit card numbers.
Credit card numbers are not just a set of random digits.  Only particular
patterns of numbers can be valid.  This existing "security provision" --
check digits -- actually ends up opening a security hole when we look at
transmitting credit card numbers via the Internet. The security feature on one side of the ledger makes it far easier to
differentiate between what is a random set of numbers, and what is in fact
a valid CC number.  Simple pattern analysis allows to search for valid
numbers.  It makes the potential "crooks" job much easier and its already engineered into the system.  The "credit card number" risk though is accidental, while the Netscape
Navigator risk isn't accidental at all, it's willful. Alice de 'nonymous ...

I think this is extremely important to consider.  The functions which
define relationships between large numbers of variables, (such as say the
world economy) -- these functions are not "idiot proof". They can collapse.  And, yes Virginia, the system can be "broken".
To suggest that cryptography can address this issue is to misunderstand
the problem, and is part of this whole mindset that "security" is
cryptography. Our economies are, if anything, less resilient than they were in the not
to distant past.  They are far more vulnerable.  The introduction of new
business practices, such as the reduction in most firms inventories, and
the ever greater reliance on "just in time" approaches has made us far
less able to sustain any interruption. The headlong introduction of "new variables" and new vectors into an
unstable system has never been "sound policy".  I guess it's sort of like what happened when rabbits were introduced into
Australia.  An eco-catastrophe. Perhaps, we can all agree that existing systems are best "not
destabilized".  Then again, I'm not the one who gets his jollies by
rocking the boat.  I get mine elsewhere.
I guess here then is the real question, what is the fallback plan when something does go catastrophically wrong??  What then, hand-wringing, and saying that it "exceeded our theoreticians predictive capabilities" just does not suffice.

This story truly is a non-starter.  Big deal.  It really has no

So Canada spied on its allies -- Mexico and South Korea particularly --
and possibly picked up some information which helped Canada to outbid
the United States on a lucrative wheat deal with China.
So what??  As they say ... you snooze you loose.  Deitweiler's attempt to get American farmers into the picture isn't

As the box at the end of the story shows, Canada simply doesn't
currently have the budget to do a really broad search of the United

SPY WORLD
Electronic snooping part of the trade game with friendly countries
Intelligence agencies comb the airwaves for useful data
Jim Bronskill
The Canadian Press
  Intelligence experts said Monday it's no big secret that Canada's
high-tech spy agency snoops on friendly countries for financial gain.
  Increasingly, intelligence agencies around the world are using their
antennas, computers and codebreakers to gather economic information,
said Wesley Wark, a University of Toronto history professor.
  Some of Canada's largest trading partners -- including the United
States, France and Japan -- comb the airwaves for useful information,
so Canada would be foolish not to join the game, said Wark.
  "I don't know what a friendly power in the economic sphere is,
exactly, these days," he said.  "That seems to be a very ambiguous
  Canada's secretive Communications Security Establishment -- an arm
of the Defence Department -- collects and analyses communications
traffic on the activities of foreign states, corporations and people.
  Jan Shorten, a former CSE employee, told CTV News in an interview
Sunday the agency spied on Canada's allies and trading partners --
including Mexico and South Korea -- by eavesdropping on embassies,
consulates and diplomats.
  In a follow-up segment for broadcast Monday, Shorten said the CSE
frequently intercepted telephone conversations and faxes of Canadians
working at foreign embassies in Canada.
  The government acknowledged earlier this year it uses CSE data to
help develop foreign and defence policies.
  In New Zealand where a meeting of Commonwealth countries just
wrapped up, Prime Minister Jean Chretien did not deny Canada is spying
on allies.
  "This is an organization that works within the law of Canada,"
Chretien told reporters. "They do not report to me on a daily basis
and I cannot make any comments on if they are spying on anybody, I
don't know.
  "But they have a mandate to check a few things around the world.
Probably somebody is listening to us at this moment."
  The prime minister also said that of any laws have been broken,
"somebody will have to pay the price."
  In a book published last year, former CSE employee Mike Frost told
how the agency electronically picked up information that helped Canada
outbid the United States on a lucrative 1982 wheat deal with China.
  Such clandestine behaviour may be unethical, but countries do it,
said U.S. journalist David Kahn, who has written extensively on
intelligence matters.
  "It's just too valuable to give up," said Kahn, a visiting historian
at the National Security Agency, the CSE's much larger U.S. cousin.
  "I wouldn't be surprised if the United States was trying to break
Canadian codes."
  Ottawa maintains that the CSE, the NSA and their counterparts in
Britain, Australia and New Zealand have all agreed not to spy on each
  The government also says the CSE does not target Canadians and
scrupulously abides by Canadian laws.
  Shorten said the CSE stepped up its operations against foreign
embassies in Canada in 1991.  She recalled hearing conversations of
Canadinas employed there -- even one woman's phone call to her doctor.
  An appalled Shorten eventually confronted her boss, who assured her
the practice was legal.
  The agency is obligated to destroy information about Canadians it
scoops up in its electronic net, said Wark.  A rare exception might be
a phone call describing a terrorist plot.

Most people believe THAT a digital signature is evidence that I am who my

In fact, I think that thinking something is secure when it isn't leads to even more trouble, and could even lead to many tragedies.
In a nutshell, here's the problem.
If someone takes my pgp secret keyring and my password, then they can sign a message *digitally* so that people believe the spoofed message is really from me.  In fact, since most people tend to rely on a pgp message far more than a non-pgp message, most people would be absolutely convinced that the message was in fact from me.
Signing with PGP is just not a solution.

Calgary.  And Canada's ambassador to the United States, the Prime
Minister's nephew -- Raymond Chretien -- left Washington and spoke to the
Calgary Chamber of Commerce about NAFTA on Friday. Chretien was particularly troubled by remarks from Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole, about wanting to re-open Chapter 19 in the NAFTA.  Following his
Chamber of Commerce address, Chretien was quoted as saying, "For us,
Chapter 19 is the heart of NAFTA.  And this dispute mechanism has been put
in there to take into account the fact that we are a much smaller economy,
a much smaller country.  We have to rely on those tri-national panels to
defend our interests." Chretien for now is chalking up the threatening comments to political posturing in the run-up to the presidential election next year, otherwise he said, "we will have a serious problem."
Chretien also played down security concerns after a knife-wielding
intruder broke into his uncle's (the Prime Minister's) home at 24 Sussex. Despite living in Washington, D.C., Chretien said he doesn't fear for his

Sachs posts to misc.invest.stocks instead and says that the Goldman Sachs
Strip Coupon Fund is better than the one from Merrill Lynch -- that it's
safer and produces higher returns because Goldman uses cubic spline
interpolation methodologies to interpolate the yield curve, while Merrill
Lynch doesn't.  There is a difference here. In the first case, the poster is not commenting about anything to do with

problem. You really can't have it both ways.  You can't post officially and

going to take your comments as an official statement from Sun. You are
that product's spokesperson, whether you disclaim or not, and should act

RICO is very serious stuff.  Criminal prosecution under the terms of the
Racketeer-Influenced & Corrupt Organizations Act is reserved for very
serious situations indeed.  It's true "rubber hose" stuff. It was intended as a tool for use against mobsters, but US attorneys have
used it against white-collar criminals.  I think, you'd have to have
strong evidence of an ongoing "criminal enterprise", which I don't think
you have with junk e-mail. I doubt that there are many experts in RICO as it applies to computer law. I really don't know if the laws pertaining to breaches of computer
security would be applicable, or not, or how RICO really does work or fit. Although the armchair solicitor in me might speculate that you'd have to
show some form of organized collusion or somesuch to breach computer or
network integrity to prosecute under RICO.  And you'd have to show -- I'm
uncertain if the standard is beyond a reasonable doubt or not -- that it
was at some point willful and well-organized. I suppose that is a moot point though, when we're talking about pre-trial
forfeiture of all assets -- right down to the food in the refrigerator.  I
doubt at that point that a trial would be forthcoming.  It really does
reinforce the maxim, that it's best not to fight a battle that you cannot
win.  RICO is very persuasive that way. I'm certain that there will be those who would say that it's not
administratively possible to apply RICO to this situation.  Most legal
advisers would probably say that it can't be done, but I suppose then,
that would be the time for the clarion call, "Then get me a lawyer who
says it CAN be done." Personally, however, I'm unconvinced, and would defer to those much more
knowledgable in such matters.  Although, in all honesty, RICO and computer networks in the same sentence
literally scares the be-jeebers outta me. Alice de 'nonymous ...

services??  The foregone profits of today.  Or is this the future cash
flow opportunities which could arise from this type of activity.  The
future assets of tomorrow? Essentially, doesn't all of this reduce to "valuing" in present dollar
terms (i.e.  attaching a discounted present value through some appropriate
hurdle rate) to some level of future benefit. The real issue as I see it, is finding some way to actually "fund" that hazy discounted present value.
As long as it of course *obviously* excludes product like Netscape
Navigator -- the black-box code with significant security holes and flaws --
I'd have to agree that this is in fact a very good idea.
But it requires forward-thinking.  It's no different actually than paying someone for what they know, rather than paying them for what they do.
It sounds good on the surface.  In fact the liason officer / integrator
might even establish some valuable "working relationships".  I think that
this form of thinking is what will define who will be long term players in
this industry -- and who won't.  Those who are able to build "goodwill" will survive and flourish, while
the others will flounder. If I may paraphrase, I believe that Dan is speaking possibly of
loss-leader services.  Services which do not in actuality show presently
as "high value-added" under our antiquated systems of accounting and
measurement.  Services which might in fact reduce short-term "profits"
because they are "current-expensed" rather than being recognized as the
deferred assets, they in fact truly are. (Essentially, the same problem we've visited with R&D expenses.  The
problem where the "solution" is defined as cutting R&D expense, so that
there is increased "profit", although long-term health and corporate
competitiveness is actually weakened.  A true management accounting
There should be a re-focus onto a horizon that is somewhat longer than the
current quarter.  Or the current day, for that matter, or the current
moment.  Unfortunately, these types of "forward-thinking" plans and
projects all require current funds.  Money.  And lots of it, before they
start showing and generating "measurable" returns.  It really is the
laying and strengthening of foundations. And who has the authority to spend any money on "wasteful" foundations??
If no one funds these types of projects, either jointly or individually, then these projects and bright ideas invariably go absolutely nowhere.

The Stasi listening infrastructure wasn't solely in their
headquarters. Listening stations for terrestrial frequencies were
spread along the borders, notably here is the station on the Brocken,
a mountain in the Harz. The central station for interception of
satellite traffic (read: international telephone communication, even
when not entering or leaving the country) was located in Biesenthal, a
small town near Berlin.
It's hard to reconstruct what part of interception took place in the
Stasi HQ, my guess is that all international telephone traffic leaving
or entering the country was intercepted there. For technical reasons
it was impossible to intercept all domestic traffic from a single
central location, the telephone system worked on a purely mechanical
basis. It seems that almost all of the telephone surveillance
equipment was destroyed during the revolution or shortly after.
Things look different for the mentioned radio equipment. The Stasi
used a combination of Russian and self-made technology. The
top-of-the-notch Russian equipment is back in Russia. But most of the
Russian equipment was sold by the Russian guards (their pay is
_really_ low, even more so when compared to western money), the Stasi
equipment was forgotten about and eventually stolen. This equipment is
now mainly in the hands of about 3 or 4 individuals.

I'm confused.  Are you saying that the answer is hardware??  Why I think
someone already thought of that. It's called a MEDIC-ALERT bracelet. As someone who's blood type is rare, I can appreciate this.
I don't see the comparison.
High value "chips" have additional security precautions engineered into
them, over and above low-value chips, hopefully Schneier realizes this.  There are also regular "counts", in fact perpetual "counts" in all casinos. I mean pit bosses and managers have to do something to earn their keep.
(other than handing out comps, I mean.)
There's also an "eye in the sky" lording over you in a casino, and the
"chips" aren't actually "cleared" until you cashout.  I'm not sure how
Schneier got the idea that it was instantaneous clearing, but it isn't by
any stretch of the imagination. But then what do I know ... I don't even sign my posts with PGP.
Why bother with having records on the "Net".  What if the net goes down, then what??  Where are you left then?  Relying on technology, simply because something CAN be done is very bad practice, when its not needed. When I travelled in the States, I simply kept a copy of my travel documents in my wallet.  I never had any problem.  And I had a copy of my pertinent medical data, attached via a MEDIC-ALERT bracelet to my body.
Then again, the amount of information that you want a doctor reading over
when you do have an emergency is minimal.  You really want the doctor to
act, not to get to know all of the details which aren't relevant to your
treatment. There's no need to overload someone, you simply have to give someone the
resources they need in order to get the job done. And that is the critical point, isn't it??  Getting the job done, and giving someone what's needed to do so.

The remailer operators can't even agree on a standard header syntax.  Some
support one header to request remailing, while others support another. I remember some time ago, that I was using a non-compliant (i.e. unique)
remailer located in Berkeley.  I was trying to post some information that
would have helped to expedite the FDA approved study on medicinal
marijuana. The article detailed that Health & Welfare Canada was growing a bumper
high-potency crop to help teach the Edmonton city police about the wicked weed.  Especially, cultivation techniques.
I thought that this might be "helpful" to the medicinal marijuana study. I thought that since the Canadian Government was granting licenses to
help law enforcement, that they might not be opposed to studying its
possible health benefits as well. (Canada's government funded health care system, could use some cost saving
measures.  If there is something useful there, it could help redirect
funding, and indirectly ameliorate the current waiting lists and service
cuts for all Canadians.)
I thought that the study organizers in the United States, MAPS I believe
 -- the ones who had complied with all US laws and regulations and permits
and headed up by a guy named, Rick Doblin, a fellow who's apparently
writing a thesis on Public Policy at the Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard -- I thought that the study organizers might be able to get what
they needed from the Canadian FDA equivalent, Health & Welfare, Canada. (Disclaimer: Unofficially, of course, not speaking for Health & Welfare Canada.  I have absolutely no connection with anyone, anywhere or anything at all in any possible form whatsoever.  In fact this post may well be the product of random typing by a simian life form.)
Silly me.
The damn post never was posted.  It was either editted out of the data
stream, or something else nefarious occurred. I mailed the remailer-operator about this, and asked: "What's the problem?"
And the remailer operator didn't reply to the message. *Sigh* Now, no-one in Berkeley, not a cypherpunk of all people, could be opposed
to seeing marijuana legalized, now could they??  I mean not, California,
eh?? Maybe, I just couldn't figure out how to post, and how to use a remailer.  I don't know.  Or maybe I had one too many beers and should've
stuck to having soda's.

Consider it a demonstration of why you should do just what you are

It is the best way to ensure a persistent persona whilst retaining
For a purportedly security conscious impostor, you sure are reluctant
to make use of simple authentication tools.  Your risk assesment is
seriously out of whack too.
You do *not* need a secure machine to improve the level of
authentication of your posts: signing your posts would provide better
authentication than no authentication, even if the machine is not
tempest shielded, nor in a secure installation.
Finding your machine (we don't know remember), and installing a kernel
patch to catch your passphrase as it is typed in, or snag it from PGPs
core image is much harder to achieve, even if you are using a multi
user system.
PGP signing your post will give a much better authentication than
people who post from known email addresses; forgeries, and machine
breakins are not that hard to effect.
Oh so you do care about authentication :-)
An offer: you post your own key, and I'll post a revocation.
You might find that people take you more seriously once they know they
are talking to a persistent persona.

Sure. Two different situations.
If I take a message or a data tape and encrypt it with a one time pad.  And then I send the message out to someone via Greyhound or DHL.
And once they've confirmed that they have the encrypted message safely in hand, then I'll call them and ask them to call me with their public key
delivered by voice via telephone.
Which I then use to encrypt the one-time-pad, using the PGP key only once.
Then, I'm comfortable sending it (not the message, but the pad) over the Internet encrypted with PGP.  And I think at that point, I have Pretty Good Privacy.

Alice here ...
Sorry to follow up on my own post, but I made a boo boo.  A real, big
boo boo.
Actually, I made a big mistake here.  It's not good enough for me to
call them.  Usually I have them first call me, and then I call them
I learned to do this in real-estate when I had my property management
Very often, someone would call the office, and say something along the
lines of "This is Constable Acheson, from the Calgary City Police.
Could you please tell me the forwarding address of your former tenant,
Alice" (or Bob, or whatever).
My standard response always was to ask for whoever identified himself
as "Constable Acheson" to provide his division.  Then I'd hang up,
check the number for the main switchboard in the phone book and then
call him.  This way, I'd be sure it was actually him, and that he was
calling from where he claimed.
You'd probably be surprised (or maybe not) how many times, there was
no such Constable.  Luckily, I just didn't give out my information to
just *anyone*.
And the same stuff applies here ... with reading and verifying the key
over the telephone.  With the phone call there should be a hangup and then
some third-party authority to confirm that the channel of communication is
*really* a valid channel. Sorry, about leaving that part out.  It was a boo boo, eh?  But it's important, RL stuff.
Yep, it was the real me this time ... and no, I didn't add another
"signature" encrypted or not encrypted to the bottom of this post. Let me ask this though??  Would the "quality" of my post changed one way
or another, if this was signed, or not?? IMHO, the message should make sense (or not) either way.

Mountain Dew and Pizza??  Ohh, waita minutae ... this is California.
That means it's probably smoked salmon, with avocado and mayonnaise
pizza.  Yum.  Seriously though ... I'm green with envy.  I'd love to attend something like this, but logistics would be a
nightmare.  First, I'd have to get clearance from the US government
for that.  And I think I'm on their "undesirable" list, and would need
to get some type of waiver to clear immigration.  Problems, eh??
I tried to call the Consul-General this afternoon, actually to inquire
about that and got put on perpetual hold and forced to listen to some
long recording.  Then I was told that if I wanted any information at
all, I should call a 1-900 number.
A 1-900 number??  Too rich for my blood.
I guess that Foggy Bottom, really is worried about their budget
issues, aren't they?  I guess they really want me to use my quarter
for pretty much everything.
Oh, I hate large groups, unless I have prepared text.
Cool.  About reinforcements on the rostrum.  I know, I really wouldn't inspire any confidence in the audience, at all. I'd probably go off into some strange side track on the nuances of
something completely irrelevant and loose the entire audience while
talking.  I'm really one of those people that doesn't always have facts,
and figures, and symbols readily at hand.  It's a cognitive thing. Sort of like a database inquiry.
Alternatively, if I do focus on an issue.  YIKES!!  My Aunt Danielle
always warned me about my tendancy to use nuclear weapons when simple
artillery would suffice.  I tend to come on a "bit" heavy at times, unless
I actively self-censor.  It really is a constant battle on that front. I'm really not sure I'd necessarily want to break "bad news" to
people, reinforcements or not.  I saw this yesterday, at a
presentation that I was at.  It was horrible, and I wasn't even
presenting.  I was in the audience -- an invited guest.  I sorta kinda pissed on someone's campfire, and after that no-one
wanted to talk to me.  Shoot if looks could kill ...
I'd be worried about reputations and popularity, and what this all
means "long-term", beyond the time-line of the presentation.
I know that explaining some of this might severely limit future
opportunities.  I think I read that somewhere recently ... that
"consultants with blood on their hatchets" usually don't get very far. But it's your talk, I guess.  Just my $.02.

I read this article, and thought it to be quite a twist.  It's suicidal
from Netscape to say this. It's almost like a couple of stock promotions I was at yesterday at the
Calgary Petroleum Club.  Horrible nasty stuff.  Suicidal speeches. Especially the one guy from Neutrino Resources (an Oil and Gas Company)
who decided to explain what a Neutrino was before he started his "spiel"
and talking about how great his company was and how cashflow wasn't a good
measure of a company's worth.
Netscape could well learn from that.  (Unfortunately, I doubt that anyone
was there.) People in these audiences DO listen.  Press, investment
analysts, and the like who do pepper the audience didn't all just fall off
the turnip truck. Jim Clark, should have seen or heard this.  If he did, then he might be a bit more careful with what he says ... but
then again, I'm not sure how involved he is in daily operations.  But
nothing that Netscape does any longer surprises this writer ... look at
how they handled the revelation back on Friday, October Thirteenth that
the emperor's product had no clothes. Did they respond to the claims??  No.  All they did was spam this list with noise "unofficially, not speaking for
the company, but I work for Netscape" noise, and then continued
distributing their product.  Maybe these revelations will help to get the
Netscape product pulled from people's machines, but I'm not gonna hold my
breath on that one. The momentum which is behind their stock and product promotion now has a life of its own.  Stopping Netscape (and the stock from advancing) is like trying to stop a steam-roller.
But for now, I'm busy setting up an email account to allow people to send
replies to me, and to settle this "reputation" stuff once and for all.  I should be back to posting very soon. Alice de 'nonymous ...

Uhhm, I think that that depends on what "class" of stockholder you're
speaking of.  The short term "trader" whose idea of a long-term investment
is the one that gives a decent return by lunchtime, or the one who wants
to buy a good company, make a solid investment, and put their stock away
for five years, knowing that their capital is being put to good use. They really are different players with different approaches.
Netscape stock as an example has lots of momentum ... it's in a feeding frenzy.  And I'm pretty sure that someone with "very" deep pockets -- possibly even someone who's got their own printing press -- is busily
buying everything in sight, and crossing trades on every up-tick.
(Disclaimer: Just my opinion, not speaking officically in any capacity.)
I'm not sure who might be behind any of this, though.  I haven't the
desktop power, nor the data or tool-set to chart and flow-analyze the
trading record, and see what the play is.)
I wouldn't really be surprised though if it was offshore interests who
want to "cash-in" on high-tech.  Standard "Von Clausewitz" reader-types. People who subscribe to "Von Clausewitz's" principles on "other means". I base this assessment purely on price-movement, and on the "known" fundamentals.  To this writer, it's pretty transparent.  In the last six-weeks, Netscape has gone from the 60's to flirting with
150. That's one heck of a trend-line that some pseudo-technical
floor-trader types will jump on. Part of that is "market-forces", and part of that is definitely
"market-makers". The only way to counteract that is probably some Elliott Wave Theory
shakeout, or something similar.  It's the only way to stop 'em from
blowing up the balloon.  Or you need one killer scandal. Cheap advice, btw ... it's free ... and no-one even had to buy me a Gin &

@_subject: Re: [noise, personal reply] CBC address. 
A post from Alice, that might be worth reading twice ...
Uhhm, thanks ... I guess ... but I wasn't _really_ looking for the CBC web site.
I was actually looking for someone to HOST a website which might showcase one particular program from the CBC, a program broadcast
in Canada which highlighted how AECL (Atomic Energy of Canada, Limited)
fails to practice safe computing and then when confronted, implements
a calculated program of strategic misrepresentation.  (i.e.  they lie.)
I thought that someone who strongly felt that error-free protocols and
error-free methods were important -- especially in mission critical
applications like medicine, commerce, or nuclear power plants -- might
possibly contact the CBC, and either voluntarily donate some bandwidth
and a host site, or conversely build a site devoted to showcasing the
human tragedy that can follow in the wake of shoddily designed
I mean, good grief, we have Atomic Energy of Canada taking a cavalier
attitude towards computer code.  Not only is AECL involved in nuclear
medicine, in building wonderful radiological tools to help cancer
patients (theoretically) live, but they BUILD nuclear reactors worldwide.  The CBC broadcast documented how this international firm REACTS to
reports of computer software errors.  It documents how the firm reacts
to reports of people dying because of sloppily written computer code.
The program is NOT (unfortunately) on the  website, but
should be placed on the net and made available.  I'm not sure how, that was misunderstood.
But your next statement helped make it clear.
I wasn't really asking for an answer, my Ottawa friend.  I really wasn't
looking for _another_ email in my mailbox to answer and address in my
copious spare time.  I was looking for some assistance. No direct reply was necessary.  Someone could simply announce that they were volunteering to quarterback
bringing a host website online, and dealing with all the issues that are
involved with that (including liasing with the CBC.)
I'm not *quite* sure how you misread what I was hoping to achieve.
If however, you were looking to convince me to post to from a remailer
that allows replies ... one that might let you send me known plain text
back through it ... something traceable back to me ... then I *might*
really understand, and I might beg off for a bit. Bit premature, and such ...
I think I'll pass on _that_ offer, especially since I really wasn't
looking for a personal private reply to what I wrote. Maybe, if I requote myself, it will be a little clearer all around.
(That's, strike two, btw ... to my Ottawa friend.)
Now, how on earth, (after rereading what I wrote) did my words get
misunderstood??  And how on earth did someone figure that they needed to
establish a bi-directional communications channel with me?? I mean it's not like I'm atacking AT&T or Netscape, I'm simply trying to
coordinate a basic public service, and blow the whistle on bad code.

reliable ...  software which people expect (rightfully) not to cause any
human harm. Alice de 'nonymous ...

Alice here (the real one) ...
         [long exercise in character assassination deleted]
I think that this "writer" who felt that it was desirable to attach MY
name to this drivel deserves a good flogging. Clearly, someone is spending WAY to much time on //WIRES on the Dow Jones
News Retrieval Service, or wherever else they get to Canadian Press news
stories.  The matter Mr. mystery-writer detailed is in fact a Canadian
matter, a domestic affair, which has no concern to an international
audience. Taking three successive news stories from three days ... (press stories,
I've since pulled for my own reference) and pasting them together to
indicate some type of Machiaevellian?? (sp) exercise is simply "not done." I don't see this at all.  The CSE story has no connection to anything else which is occurring domestically nor internationally.  No relationship I think Perry has far more interesting fish to fry, than to worry about domestic Canadian affairs, and what occurs within another sovereign's borders.  Whether or not Canada has collected and analyzed communications traffic on
the activities of foreign states, corporations, and people is simply a
Canadian matter.  It's OUR affair.
Airing dirty laundry like this serves no purpose, whatsoever.  It's not
productive and is not focused to any particular policy objective. And in n any event, the Canadian Communications Security Establishment
does serve up "sloppy seconds" (as some other poster named them) under
intelligence sharing agreements with its counterparts in the United
States, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand.  In the same vein, it also is a recipient of same.  These agreements and
working relationships have historically benefitted all. Fella ... whoever you are ... please get your stories straight.
The Prime Minister of Canada was trying to call NASA, not the NSA.  There IS a significant difference between the two, as near anyone on this list can The Prime Minister was attempting to contact Canadian astronaut Chris
Hadfield, who is on the space shuttle Atlantis which is presently docked
with the Russian space station Mir.  He wasn't trying to call the NSA ...  it was the NASA. In fact, the Prime Minister's comments from the Commonwealth meeting in
New Zealand were most clear.  "This is an organization that works within
the law of Canada.  They do not report to me on a daily basis and I cannot
make any comments on if they are spying on anybody, I don't know.  But
they have a mandate to check a few things around the world." Please try reading the list for a bit, before posting and confusing
people. Your juvenile antics deserve no further comment.
I don't think that this is relevant.
And btw, it's giggle test ... it's not "GiGGle TesT".  I learned how to use a shift key long, long ago.  You oughta try it some time.
The CSE does not target its own citizens and has agreements with other agencies that they will not either.  If someone's communication is accidentally caught in the net, the CSE is obligated to destroy the information except in the rarest of circumstances. (i.e. foreign terrorists)
Your fleshed out story was very interesting ... especially the way you tied things together.  Did they teach you to do that type of thing But it's not appropriate for this list.  And this is a Canadian matter.
Cute ... really.  I'm certainly amused.  As I'm certain were all the Americans on this International list.  George Bush, simply had jet lag, when he threw up at Japan.  What does he have to do with anything?
Canada and Japan have a great deal to speak about.  Canada might even be a
good friend and help the US with the Okinawa problem.  Who knows?  We
never know how these things play. I really don't think that Canada will be marginalized by this, and I certainly hope that neither will I.  Your antics, notwithstanding, and your imagination of "tying things together" serves no purpose.
The people on this list can filter fact from fiction.
Like, I said ... very, very cute.
There's only one problem, mr mystery-writer, I only have one or two
interests on this list.  And politics is not generally one of them.  My
interests are simply and in order of personal importance,      - removing known Security Holes in existing software or removing the
       software, (e.g.  Netscape Navigator and Java), and
     - finding some secure way to implement functional international
       commerce via the Internet. Probably, something ECU based. Security and E-cash. Your attempt to create some type of political "brownie points" or desire
to gain some attention or notoriety simply destracts me from addressing
the real issues, and addressing my backed-up email. MALICE DE MONSTEROUS wasn't enough for you??  Please don't bother with any reply.  None is expected.

COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT
Canada spied on allies: ex-agent
Top secret security agency accused of eavesdropping
on South Koreans by former analyst
The Canadian Press   Canada's electronic espionage agency has spied on friendly countries
such as South Korea, Mexico and Japan despite Ottawa's denials, a
former agent has told CTV News.
  "I have lived with this information for so long and I just think
that it is time that Canada knows what CSE is doing, " Jane Shorten
said in a report for broadcast late Sunday.
  Shorten, 38, worked as an analyst from 1986 to 1994 -- when she was
laid off -- for the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), CTV
  A separate entity from the better known Canadian Security
Intelligence Service, CSE can be described as a technological peeping
tom.  It specializes in electronic espionage, monitoring radio and
other transmissions for useful information.
  The Soviets and their allies were once the prime targets of such
surveillance, but after the thaw in the Cold War, CSE shifted its
attention to friendly countries, Shorten told CTV.
  The agency spied on Canada's allies and trading partners,
eavesdropping on friendly embassies, consulates, diplomats in Canada
and around the world, she said.
  Ottawa denies it.  "Countries like Canada have understandings that
they don't carry out these activities against each other, " Solicitor
General Herb Gray said earlier this year in response to claims that
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had spied on the Japanese
delegation during auto trade talks in Geneva.
  Replies Shorten: "He does not know what's going on because CSE is
certainly doing that ... I spied on the (South) Korean government for
the Canadian government."
  CSE is part of the Defence Department but Shorten insists senior
officials at the Foreign Affairs Department were fully aware of its
activities and anxious for its information.
  "I know my reports went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs," Shorten
told CTV. "My reports were classified as Top Secret Umbra and that's
as high as you can get, and these people were cleared to get that kind
of information."
  Shorten, once described by a superior as a gifted intelligence
analyst, told CTV she was aware her revelations could result in
prosecution under the Official Secrets Act but felt the risk of prison
was worth it.
  "I feel so strongly that it's time that people learned what CSE is
all about," she said.

@_author: Netscape now has a market capitalization larger than Apple Computer. 
@_subject: Re: Talking to Jim 
Uhhm, what is his email address??  I'd love to ask him one or two questions, not just about key escrow, but
about Netscape's future prospects and its current stock valuation. (Netscape now has a market capitalization larger than Apple Computer.)
I've got some questions ...
Mathew Ingram, reported in the Investment Reporter that Jim has stock
holdings currently worth more than $1 Billion in Netscape, and yet Jim was
quoted as saying at a recent technology conference "you could argue
there's something of an Internet bubble developing."  The article also
quoted him as saying that if Netscape made a profit in the next year or
two it would only be "because we miscalculated." Miscalculated??  I'll say.
If he thinks that GAK will go down with great support, when they want to
split their stock, then they're really not quite aware of the mind of the
organization that they'll be up against. I wonder what people will have to say about Netscape, then. Right now, brokerage firm Hambrecht & Quist is estimating that in five
years the Internet will be a $23 Billion market -- equal to the size of
the _entire_ software industry today.  And a money manager at Franklin
Resources Inc. said, "some people are suggesting the big tech company in
the next century could be Netscape." Personally, I don't think so.  But then who am I??
Goldman Sachs just put Netscape on its "recommended" list.  And some
analyst called Michael Parekh was quoted as saying that Netscape could hit
$200 in the next two years.  That it was going to be the Microsoft of the
Internet -- dominating the software side of the World Wide Web.
I wonder if Parekh's valuation is a pre or post stock split evaluation. Shoot, if Parekh is talking about $200 post-split ... then Netscape could
well become a really big league play in this game far sooner than most
people think.  I'd love to hear how this fits with Jim's words of a
"bubble". The market seems to "think" that it's a better present judge of what
Netscape has than he does.  It's almost as though the "market" has
developed a "mind" of its own.  It's own particular neural network.  It
doesn't seem like the market is paying attention to any of Jim's warnings
or words.  His "opinion" -- like all corporate officers opinions are
strongly discounted and very lightly weighted. It's almost as though there is automated software at work. Some people might think about going short against the box on this one.  Although the article talked about a short "squeeze" which would generally
mean that this stock is going to go nowhere but up as the short sellers
try to cover, personally, I might start to take some money off the table
and not add anything to my position.  But all this depends on the depth of
someone's pockets, I guess.  And on some serious trading analysis. Then again, there is that old adage about never fighting the tape.  It's compared frequently to whizzing into the wind, I think.  Probabilities and such.
(Disclaimer:  This is not intended as and should not be considerred as
investment advice ... or for that matter as whizzing advice, either.)
I'd love to hear Jim talk some more about this. For me, all of this Netscape stuff is getting way too surreal.  It seems
really strange.  Some people are arguing that things are getting out of
hand, and yet it seems like this one is completely out of Jim's control. No one is listening to ANYTHING from Netscape at all.  The market is
simply listening to its own internal dialogue.  And that certainly is a
surprise to this writer.  It's a surprise to me, and it's probably a
surprise to Netscape.  Finance 501 is more complex than Finance 101. Maybe they should read up about the privatization of BP and the
involvement of the KIO.  Or learn a bit about Li Ka-Shing, or something
which adds to their knowledge base.  That might give some idea about what
is actually going on here. (Not that the Kuwaiti Investment Office or Li-Ka Shing has an interest in
this one.)

Well, of course! Markets are the most efficient integration of the minds of the participants, hands down.
Exactly. Literally. And huge, too.
There is: Wetware. Massive concurrent processing, heavy parallelism, inefficient I/O. Distributed, redundant memory. Inefficient but infinitely adaptable interprocessor routing. Capable of handling any degree of outage. All elements individually expendable. Self-replicating processors that have significant lead time but integrate smoothly into the net. Designs and builds its own outboard peripherals and interconnects. Best damned planetary computing system in this star system. But I diverge...
It's not always right (though self-fulfilling prophecy is often a big part of the equation), and it often misses the anolamies, but because it IS an integration is precisely why it may mean something different than you suggest.
It may in fact be the best barometer we have of the true depth of the exploding Internet phenomenon.  Completely aside from the question of whether or not the seeming Netscape overvaluation bubble bursts, etc., Netscape's share price more directly reflects the personal involvement and upward view of real people with respect to the Internet/WWW than anything else we have.
Remember, there are still naysayers out there, declaiming in places from books to columns to TV, while the reality is that computers are now outselling televisions, and a key new form of synergistic human communication is exploding in exponential growth.  Humans deal on a personal level only moderately well with linear processes, and poorly with geometric processes -- it's understandable that the growth of the Internet/WWW and the implications of thereof would be late in being recognized and be incorrectly understood until sometime AFTER the changes have rocked the society.
Markets, though, more accurately reflect what people are actually doing, what they are willing to do, and what they think "in their gut" will happen.  While they also reflect what people might LIKE to happen, they reflect, too, that what people WANT to happen, their desires often MAKE happen.  Capitalize ME to the tune of $5 billion, for instance, and I may be influential not only during the course of your life but the lives of your great-grandchildren.
Selling Netscape short may or may not be a wise move -- selling market processes short is usually a fool's exercise in self-delusion.

Hands down efficient integration??  Not especially.  First you have to really wonder what and who the "participants" in
this market are.  As an example, year-ends have certain particular
momentums.  So do capital gains considerations.  All part of the mind
of Buddha, as some of the fruitcake players might say ... and all part
of the known interplaying "participants".
Except that this one doesn't listen to any of its sensors or input
devices.  It's learned to ignore all of *that* information, because
all of *that* information is inherently untrustworthy, so it simply
listens to it's very own dialogue.
Sort of like feeding off of a feedback loop.
Just like October, 1987.  It simply listened to itself and kept telling itself that it was
"actually" making money all the way down.  Portfolio Insurance be
damned, it was doing "OK".
IMHO, there is very little wetware left in the market.  This is now
the 90's.  Time to get with the programs.
Oooo ... duelling programs ... especially one which is designed to
ignore the other one and not listen to any of its "blather" ... this
oughta be interesting to watch ...
Luckily, I'm outside this theatre of operations. "Personal" involvement and "real" people have very little to do with a
market that is driven by institutions and other vectors.  Institutions which have to "show" what their exposure to the
"technology and Internet" sector is when they file their portfolio
reports will want to show something on their book.  And they'll look
for a safety in numbers thing, and will flock to the "darlings".
"Real people's views" also won't count for much if Netscape defines
an entire new economic sector -- the ground floor of the Internet.  "Real people" don't factor in if it becomes part of the S&P 500 and
every index fund "has" to -- by definition -- buy it.  "Real people" also have very little impact on the blow crazed trader
who's on a run and actually actively managing and turning-over the
pension funds or mutual funds of some group.  (Or even a sector fund,
whose by-laws won't allow it to sit on cash, as it flows in the door.)
These guys have far more influence than the aggregate of individuals
who might buy or sell "small" lots at the market.
"Real people" don't impact nor control the communications networks of
block trading reports.  And they don't impact systems which *must* put
their money out, and put it to work.  Real people are really just
noise in the flow.
The idea that individual supply/demand is what moves prices is a
fallacy.  It's not the "reality" behind the shell game.
Buying or selling pressure doesn't ever function as a price mover,
because for every "buyer" there is a corresponding "seller".
Zero-sums type of stuff.  It no more reflects the inherent strength of
the Internet, than the Dutch Tulip craze reflected the inherent
strength of Tulips.
Nonsense.  (No offence, btw ...)  We're back to the man who simply closes his eyes to what's happening,
or the ostrich sticking its head in the sand.  We've already got the
experience to understand how these things work.  They've got the "play book", and are following it step by step. Capitalize how?  Balance sheet?  Or market?  A $1 Billion or $2 Billion  rights issue might be one thing, but this one is another.
It really depends on what and how you use that tool, doesn't it??  As an example, short sales are excellent ways of "creating" stock in
thin markets.  They can work to create a virtual share.  This might
sound strange, but it's a feature of the "market".
"Shorts" usually sell borrowed stock hoping to buy it back cheaper at
some later date.  A broker goes out and "borrows" the stock from
another broker, and then that stock is sold to a buyer.  The two legs
of the short sale actually work together to create a "virtual" share
of the corporation.  This creates "volume" by trading a "virtual
share".  At some point, these used to be called derivative plays,
before that word became dirty in and of itself.
To explain.
Let's say that XCO owns 100 shares of Spyglass.  And YCO "shorts" 100
Spyglass.  What actually happens is that YCO has simply signed a note
saying that they "owe" XCO's broker 100 shares of Spyglass.  If YCO
now sells that stock to ZCO, then there are actually now 200 shares of
spyglass out there.  100 actual ones owned by XCO, and 100 virtual
ones owned by ZCO.  (And a note to someone that says ... I owe ya, a
100 Spyglass.)
But the "virtual" stock is indistinguishable from the "actual" stock.
Of course the generally known risk is that with price movements that
YCO could loose a lot of money on its short.  Especially in a
"squeeze" play.
But if YCO and ZCO are actually "friendly" then all they have to do is
shift a lot of money around as the price gyrates.  Back-to-back credit
facilities usually suffice for this purpose, since all that they
really need is a "note" from their banker saying that they're "good
people" and are "good for the money", if something does go wrong.
That their credit is good in the casino.
(And mathematically in fact ... they are good for the money ... cause
they don't have a market "position" or opinion, even though they can
trade one heck of a lot.)
In this case, the short can't be "squeezed" cause he's actually covered.
But it can lead to some really interesting optics.  And these programs
do listen to optics.  Especially if YCO and his ZCO friend are up
against ACO and his BCO friend.
I think it's all just a virtual war at that point.  Something to watch
via Quotron.  But then you'd need a Quotron for that, wouldn't you??

Alice here ...
Everyone should ask this question.  AT&T can sign-on to a two-page ad,
calling on Congress to balance the budget -- to cut off veterans, and
cut-off women with dependent children just before Christmas.  It can
sign on to this, but it can't bother to even offer a scholarship to
the students who helped make its fortunes.  It would rather leave the
impression that it freeloads off of other's efforts.
It's shameful.
Luckily for those of us who don't live in the United States, we can
perhaps look at that country and truly wonder what is going on over
there, and what is wrong with America?
Where are the values amongst ALL Americans, not just Netscape and
AT&T?  What are the role models that all the leaders -- business,
sports, and political leaders -- show to the national youth.
Here is all I've seen (as a foreigner), over the last while:
Enid Greene Waldholtz blubbering in a news conference about how she as
a congress person certainly COULDN'T be expected to resign after
winning her election with stolen money.  Blubbering for five hours
straight (except when she had to stop to turn a page, I mean) ... She
certainly said that "leadership" is all about playing "victim".  Poor
little Enid. (And even worse, she was _defended_ by Susan Molinari.)
Bob Dole, deciding to go to Bosnia.  The former WW II veteran
willingly jeopardizing the lives of American boys -- boys who have put
their lives on the line in a _volunteer_ armed force -- all for a
lousy political photo-op.  The chance to say ... "hey look at me, I'm
here in Bosnia."  Someone who's willing to overrule the Pentagon's own
most diplomatic advice on how complex an operation this actually is.
And then there is AT&T.  A company who's Chairman can publish a letter
which calls on Congress to cut off checks to mothers with dependent
children and war veterans days before Christmas, all while stealing
and freeloading off of the work of some students.
Scrooge ... take heart.
Here's Holiday wish   Enid do the right thing ... resign.  Say the
"right thing" and say that your child -- the future and the delayed
gratification that the future brings -- is much more important than
your own personal PRESENT political aspirations.
Here's Holiday wish   Bob, lots of people worked their asses off to
make sure that the American fighter pilot, and the two French fighter
pilots could be rescued from Bosnia.  If you want to go and get some
photo-ops, go to Germany or Italy, and give one hell of a vote of
support to the boys that are there -- a support which could just as
easily have been given and should be given in Congress.  A _real_
strong unfettered commitment.
And here's Holiday wish   AT&T.  Do the right thing.  Reward those
people who help make you a fortune.  Stand tall as an example, rather
than as an embarrassment to the nation.  You've ignored this for so
long now, that you've almost dug your own grave.  But you still have a
chance to save face.  Have the courage to take the chance when it's
offered.  Simply say that the proposal to reward David Wagner and Ian
Goldberg -- some holiday mad money and scholarships -- was lost in
committee, and approval processes -- but it WAS in the works, and it
was recommended and can now be announced just before Christmas, as a
rightful reward.
Some holiday cheer.
Will people think it's a cynical attempt at manipulation?  Yep.  But
it's a darned site better than the alternatives -- especially when you
look at possible future outcomes.  Trust me, this is far better than
calling for veterans and single mothers with children to be cut-off
just before the holidays.
Perhaps, Enid, Bob, and AT&T will all learn when to use offense and
when to use defense.  They might also learn that the best offense is a
good defense.  They might even begin to look at what "courage" truly
is, and of how difficult it can be for anyone to do the "right thing",
especially when they think that they're surrounded by minefields.  Even when the "right thing" is in your own best interest, you not only
have to be shown the right path to take, but you have to have the
motivation and courage to make the move and take action.
Enid, Bob, and AT&T, take note.
Hopefully for the holidays, everyone finds the courage to neutralize
some portion of the vulnerability spectrum they've placed themselves

The fact that the CFS install programme deletes other security software

I don't agree with all of the "Gates" character's claims against

Greed, Greed, Greed.  Use their software and you support the giant.
Remember their theft from the Berkeley graduate students each

sports, and political leaders -- show to the national youth.
Here is all I've seen (as a foreigner), over the last while:
Enid Greene Waldholtz blubbering in a news conference about how she as
a congress person certainly COULDN'T be expected to resign after
winning her election with stolen money.  Blubbering for five hours
straight (except when she had to stop to turn a page, I mean) ... She
certainly said that "leadership" is all about playing "victim".  Poor
little Enid. (And even worse, she was _defended_ by Susan Molinari.)
Bob Dole, deciding to go to Bosnia.  The former WW II veteran
willingly jeopardizing the lives of American boys -- boys who have put
their lives on the line in a _volunteer_ armed force -- all for a
lousy political photo-op.  The chance to say ... "hey look at me, I'm
here in Bosnia."  Someone who's willing to overrule the Pentagon's own
most diplomatic advice on how complex an operation this actually is.
And then there is AT&T.  A company who's Chairman can publish a letter
which calls on Congress to cut off checks to mothers with dependent
children and war veterans days before Christmas, all while stealing
and freeloading off of the work of some students.
Scrooge ... take heart.
Here's Holiday wish   Enid do the right thing ... resign.  Say the
"right thing" and say that your child -- the future and the delayed
gratification that the future brings -- is much more important than
your own personal PRESENT political aspirations.
Here's Holiday wish   Bob, lots of people worked their asses off to
make sure that the American fighter pilot, and the two French fighter
pilots could be rescued from Bosnia.  If you want to go and get some
photo-ops, go to Germany or Italy, and give one hell of a vote of
support to the boys that are there -- a support which could just as
easily have been given and should be given in Congress.  A _real_
strong unfettered commitment.
And here's Holiday wish   AT&T.  Do the right thing.  Reward those
people who help make you a fortune.  Stand tall as an example, rather
than as an embarrassment to the nation.  You've ignored this for so
long now, that you've almost dug your own grave.  But you still have a
chance to save face.  Have the courage to take the chance when it's
offered.  Simply say that the proposal to reward David Wagner and Ian
Goldberg -- some holiday mad money and scholarships -- was lost in
committee, and approval processes -- but it WAS in the works, and it
was recommended and can now be announced just before Christmas, as a
rightful reward.
Some holiday cheer.
Will people think it's a cynical attempt at manipulation?  Yep.  But
it's a darned site better than the alternatives -- especially when you
look at possible future outcomes.  Trust me, this is far better than
calling for veterans and single mothers with children to be cut-off
just before the holidays.
Perhaps, Enid, Bob, and AT&T will all learn when to use offense and
when to use defense.  They might also learn that the best offense is a
good defense.  They might even begin to look at what "courage" truly
is, and of how difficult it can be for anyone to do the "right thing",
especially when they think that they're surrounded by minefields.  Even when the "right thing" is in your own best interest, you not only
have to be shown the right path to take, but you have to have the
motivation and courage to make the move and take action.
Enid, Bob, and AT&T, take note.
Hopefully for the holidays, everyone finds the courage to neutralize
some portion of the vulnerability spectrum they've placed themselves

Alice here ...
Everyone should ask this question.  AT&T can sign-on to a two-page ad,
calling on Congress to balance the budget -- to cut off veterans, and
cut-off women with dependent children just before Christmas.  It can
sign on to this, but it can't bother to even offer a scholarship to
the students who helped make its fortunes.  It would rather leave the
impression that it freeloads off of other's efforts.
It's shameful.
Luckily for those of us who don't live in the United States, we can
perhaps look at that country and truly wonder what is going on over
there, and what is wrong with America?

@_subject: Re: Do the Right Thing 
That's always a tough position to be in.  If Netscape or Microsoft
knew what was the "right" thing to do, I don't doubt that they'd be
doing it.
The problem is always that there is no crystal clear "right" answer
on lots of these issues.  Everything is always "fuzzy" because of the
possible consequence that flows from action.
Good quote, Tim.  I'll lift a glass of eggnog at the end of the "open door policy" as
well.  It really doesn't serve anyone's interests at all.  My concern
is the policy wind-down challenge.  It can call for a real strong
stomach sometimes, as Greenspan could probably attest.  It probably shouldn't be embraced except by the most foolish of fools.
Sure, this isn't news to anyone.  Time is now compressed.
There usually has to be some lead time to these things.  AT&T as an
example has been well rewarded -- in fact, some circles might suggest
that they were overly well-rewarded -- when they got a $1 Billion plus
preferential contract in the Middle East (Bahrain, if memory serves ...)
following Desert Storm.
Does this then mean that anyone should be surprised with Thomson-CSF's
alternate means against Raytheon?  Not this cowboy.  We're into a completely different altitude of engagement here.
Completely different.  And in this case, we not only face an enemy,
but we're surrounded with civilians who can get caught in the
cross-fire.  No different than the orphans who were used as human
shields in Bosnia.
These companies generally need to be briefed early on what the action
plan will be and on the possible range of consequences and the
attendant probabilities so that proper contingencies can be drawn up.
Unless of course, these companies are actually your adversary, while
posing as your friend, in which case it's best to keep them out of the
loop altogether.  Probably best just to amuse them, as you do a child in a crib, while
you go about your affairs.
Clark's voiced support for GAK is one of the most insane ideas I have
come across.  Does he have any idea of what he is tinkering with?
Does he know how to play his tune of Tommy the Tinkerer??
Somehow, I have doubts.  Serious doubts.
His GAK comments could trigger a very nice cascade throughout the
entire high-tech sector which could spill over and out.  "Friendly
Fire" could be deadly to some American financial powerhouses.  Not
only could Jim throw a monkey-wrench into the exit-strategies of
valley venture-capitalist's, but this whole scenario could well spill into other issuers if he's not careful.
To understand, the market truly is not looking at Netscape as a
"software" play.  It is the quintessential Internet play -- a whole
"new" economic sector.  The sector which many Dow firms (IBM, AT&T, and Disney) hope to
exploit as part of their mid to long-term business plans. Future earnings forecasts and indeed valuations up and down the street
are based around the assumption of Internet success.  Jim is playing
with fire, if the audience he's _hoping_ to address isn't listening to
him while _another_ audience in fact is.
Anyone who doubts this, or thinks that the markets aren't particularly
vulnerable and sensitive, shouldn't listen to me -- who am i -- they
should listen instead to the true "professionals".  Here's what Doug Casey, an investment adviser out of Baltimore is
    "We're at the tail end of one of the great manias of history,
    where value is thrown totally to the wind and everybody with two
    nickels to rub together plans on making a million with mutual
    funds.  I sincerely hope that all the best happens and the market
    goes to 10,000.  But I'm not planning on joining the party.  Since
    May, 1985, when the mutual fund assets market reached a $100
    Billion (US), asset growth has gone hyperbolic.  Half of all the
    money in equity funds has come in during the last TWO years.  It's
    a mania of historic proportions.  It's completely and totally
    insane."
I might go one step further, and ask the thorny question of how much
of that recent mutual fund investment -- the "hot money" that's come
in over the last two years -- is actually "leveraged money".  How much
of it is borrowed funds?  Probably a pretty fair chunk.
Then I might ask how many of these casino bets, are with money that
people truly can't afford to loose.  How many IRA's or college funds
are invested either directly or indirectly in Spyglass, or some other
darling??  Instead of prudent "blue-chip" stuff, that couldn't
*possibly* ever take a big hit -- parts of the Dow Industrials -- like
AT&T or Disney??  Again, probably a fair chunk.
Let's suppose that as a result of Jim's GAK comments, people loose
faith and ask to redeem their mutuals.  What's the cash-position of
these funds?  Do they have the liquidity to meet the redemptions or
will they have to engage in selling wave after selling wave -- selling everything regardless of "fundamentals"?  And then will the across
the board selling cause ever more redemptions as hopes and dreams fade and as reality sets in?
Maybe, I'll help answer that question, by quoting analyst, Leo Hood,
from Gainesville Florida, who spoke of some of the risks and attempted      "One by one, investors have moved their money out of conservative
     investments and into growth funds and high-tech stocks.  Many
     feel this concentration of power in the hands of a few is a
     safeguard against a horde of small investors selling all at
     once.  I think the opposite is true.  With funds down to very low
     cash levels, a panic by individuals is likely to make matters
     worse."
Hood is correct in this case, about the present state of mutual fund
liquidity.  It's next to non-existant.  And Hood raises another market
vector to contend with.  The so-called "safeguard" no longer resides
in broadly distributed wetware.  Instead, everything is auto-pilot.
The safeguard -- Mr. "Safeguard" Circuit-breaker investment fund
manager -- can't default on a client redemption.  If he doesn't have
cash in the bank, he has no option but to raise cash by selling.
In fact, he might not even have the authority or discretion to
determine what he'll sell.  He might be forced to follow the
Investment Committee's guidelines and formulae.  He might even try to
play hero, and over-sell near the perceived market "top" to meet his
anticipated future redemptions, and "beat the market", so that he and
his fund have claim to future "bragging rights".
Seeds for an anticipatory meltdown??
In addition to the historic mania for mutual funds, Alan Newman from
Great Neck, New York tries to help out and give us some historical
perspective on where our market sits, historically.  He looks back
     "The dollar value of all U.S. stocks now amounts to 85.9 per-cent
     of nominal GNP -- far and away the highest such reading of all
     time.  Prior peaks in August 1929 at 77.4 per-cent, December 1968
     at 79.3 per-cent and December 1972 at 80 per-cent were all
     followed by brutal bear markets that lopped off at least 21
     percent in value over the next twelve months.  Two of these
     times, 1929 and 1973-74 -- marked the start of the two worst bear
     markets of the century.
To understand and give Alan's words some context, especially his
observation that these nosebleed valuation levels were invariably
followed by spectacular historic corrections, let's remember that
his data reflected old fundamentals.  The old-style market.
This is not '29 nor '73-74.  Back then, we didn't have the compressed
ultra-sensitive global market we now face, where a sneeze turns into
an earthquake.
We also didn't use the complex financial instruments (many of which
are off-balance sheet) like we now do.  And we didn't have duelling
neural nets in charge of trading. The seasoned professionals with the experience and human reason and
judgment to manage these events are gone.  The ones who had the
authority in the past to exercise their "judgment" in managing new
"unlearned" events have had all of their authority stripped from them.
That authority now sits in other hands.  In silicon.
During '29 and 73-74, the markets certainly weren't facing the type
of optimism that we're facing today ... (well maybe, in '29 they
were.)  An optimism which has been fuelled by the media.  Including
such memorables as the Rolling Stones "Start me up" which I've heard hummed in elevators.  They weren't facing the "News" on the front
page of every major periodical and the near constant bombardment on
the "Internet".
And no one need mention that nifty icon in the corner of every
computer screen.  The coverage has set individual expectations to
unattainable levels.
All of the above, might well come together to form a "series of
factors" which act serially -- factors which will magnify market swings.
If all of this hasn't helped convince Jim, perhaps Paul Franke from
Kansas City might shed some additional illumination on the present situation.  Some recent history.
He tried to look at the current market within a narrower time frame
than Alan Newman's long-term historical.  He wanted to give some
     "In late 1994, skepticism and pessimism among investors were very
     high.  Mutual funds had cash levels of close to 10 per-cent.
     Some 60 per-cent of investment advisers were staunchly bearish.
     Interest rates were high after rising all year.  Inflation seemed
     to be picking up steam.  Today, the stock market is in the
     opposite position it was a year ago.  Futures traders are more
     bullish than they have been in several years, and mutual fund
     cash levels have fallen to near a record low.  Cautioning
     investors to watch their step may prove to be an understatement."
Some very good advice there from Kansas City about watching your step.
We have many other vectors to consider.  One, is the manner in which
mutual funds report unit-holder value.  Mutual funds do not present
and publish a "real-time" value.  The reported NPV lags the
calculation.  The value most people see published and what they will
react to, is not actualy where "it is" -- it's actually where "it was".
This information "air-gap" will tend to make the unit-holder reaction
time much longer and will tend to continue and give life to negative
news, as well as presenting exploitation opportunities to market
professionals who have an information advantage.
Domestic and International Pros will use this "feature" to calculate
and approximate the reported unit-holder value before the report hits the press.  On the basis of educated "guesses", they will likely trade through overnight or international markets to pre-position themselves prior to the general release of mutual fund values to the American public, again magnifying the raid.
This combined interplay -- between the public and the professional --
would respectively extend the reaction period and, magnify intra-day
market movements.  Or in plain English, it would last longer and be
more volatile.  Or much more succinctly, as Irwin Yamamoto said,
"_Mutual Funds_ will be an obscene expression."
The full impact would of course require a full analysis and model of
another vector, that of the entire futures market and that of
international arbitrageurs.  When they smell blood, they tend to
behave as piranha.  Arbs and "vulture funds" have the resources --
personnel resources as well as procedural resources to preferentially
position themselves such that they have an advantage of trading
execution and a preferential view of how market buy/sell orders flow
into the theatre of the exchange.  Both professional types are prepared at a moment's notice to jump in
or refrain.  They can assess track record's, determine
capitalization's, psychoanalyze the personalities of everyone involved
and phone everyone in their Rolodex looking for some clue and subtlety
to play.
(Arbs not only have Breaking News Co-ordiantors but are also privy to
particular intelligence.  They recall how the market-makers took it on
the chin in '87 and had to go to the window.  Many market-makers made
great sacrifices in attempts to maintain order during '87.  A
sacrifice they may not willingly make to ensure system-liquidity now.)
All of these factors (and many more) will tend to interplay in one big
international soup.
Clearly, Jim is not only in position to influence the future of GAK,
but he could cause a great deal of trouble throughout the chain of the
US financial system.  The market does not need a jittery Chairman,
going on about GAK.  No one is served by this type of play.
I doubt the President wants a market meltdown as we start to move
towards an election year.  Body bags and a bad economic front are a
bad mix and could swing the whole election with the dual near unsurmountable election obstacles.  Then again, Bob Dole probably wouldn't want to take hold of the Presidential reins in that environment, either.
As an endnote to something that really wasn't relevant to Jim's GAK
comments, something which veered off and almost assumed a life of its
own, I'd say that the probability of the foregoing is certainly in
excess of one chance in ten.
Yep, we're in "the shit" as they say.  Preparation can be a good thing.
I still think that coming out and saying what is being said, is risky
business.  It is a comment out of left field.  But then I'm not privy
to all the variables either, so take my comments with a grain of salt.
Yep Tim, I'll agree with you on this. I think Maurice Strong has also been saying something along these lines for some time.  Warning about systems and monocultures.  Sadly,
monocultures can develop without our even seeing it.  Or at least, I
think Maurice has been saying something along those lines in his own
Sure.  Just like Christmas in Bosnia will, undoubtedly.
'Tis the season ...
Hopefully, god-willing, we won't face any tragedies.

Soory ... beg to differ ... my real email is not registered in some database in Finland.  No offence, but you have no idea what I have registered in Finland.  Whatever lies behind the anon address is simply
something which is "reasonably" reliable.  It could be a dummy account, or it could even be a chain of remailers and processes.  Who knows??  Do you?
How difficult would it be to retrieve it from Finland?  I don't really

breaking or finding an appropriately encrypted key, doesn't *quite*
address the problem of people sending email to me without any hassle,
does it?? I think that the ISP who hosts my remailer has already had to deal with
a slew of mail over the "Alice" antics, and the spoofed posts.  This way, if someone wants to take issue with something which they've read, the ISP can simply ask them to write the author.
Great that's your choice and your perogative.  I don't see what on earth
you'd have to say to me in any event.  And before you go patting yourself
on the back about impersonations, have a look at my last post to this list. The one under the subject of "Do the Right Thing." Right at the bottom of the post is my signature, and ... ta dah ... my
penet address.  What does that *logically* tell you??  Maybe that the author of that post, the long-winded one that criticizes Jim Clark for his stand on GAK and his short-sighted views will accept email via penet.fi at an455120 I trust penet to do one thing for me.  I trust penet not to send me email
that is larger than 1 Megabyte.  And the reason I trust penet not to do that is that Julf's mailer won't handle it.  His mailer will choke on it.
That's it.
If you think that I'm relying on Julf to protect me, then you are sadly
mistaken.  Many, many people already share in the secret of who Alice is. That's a fact.  I'm not looking for anyone to keep my identity a "secret". I'm simply looking for some peace so that I can do some reading, some
writing, and some "thinken".  And Julf protects me from huge emails.
That's it.  And now, if anyone wants to establish a dialogue with me, they can.  Or if they don't want to (like you) then that's not a problem for me either.  My previous way of getting contacted (via postmaster or
postmaster didn't seem to be working well.  The two
companies weren't forwarding email to me.  Never got anything from them forwarded.
Now, not only AT&T and Netscape can talk with me, so can anyone else.
And if they want to have some "secure" super-secret dialogue with me, then
we can do that also.  I've posted a partial protocol on how to do that
already.  Not one that's for super-dee-dooper secret stuff, but one that's

Sure, I realize this.  I'm very aware of it in fact.  The art of persuasion is the science of selfish self-interest.  Once a

they generally do the "right" thing, what's in their interest.

...
      ...
This sounds like a capital idea.  I'm certain that the FBI and other law-enforcement officials might
also learn by living in a city where the East truly meets the West.
Budapest is a beautiful old city of bridges, not just literally but
figuratively.  It's where anyone in the world can find comfort.
Americans, French, German, Syrian ... all can use it for transit.
And the annual Grand Prix is one heck of a car race as well.  An
international grand-luxe congregation opportunity.  Burwitz probably
doesn't consider Budapest a hardship post.  Especially if he found
himself a shack up in the hills of Buda on Rose Hill.
If Burwitz is concerned with emerging democracies, he might profit
from reading some briefing papers, and leaving some of his
pre-conceptions at the door.  Especially, if he plans on getting full
value from his visit.  True bang for the buck, as it were.
Hungary has always been open to "free travel".  That's why they had a Hilton and an Inter-Continental in Budapest.  In
fact, the "collapse" of the Berlin Wall -- which was missed by most
intelligence agencies -- was a direct result of free travel on the far
side of the "Iron Curtain".
There was always travel freedom within COMECON.  There had to be.
Truckers as an example traveled throughout the East.  And there were
always family vacations as well.  What was missing was a way to have
large population movements from East to West.  Migration.
Hungary solved that problem when it opened its border with its
historic ally-cum-subjugator, Austria.  Hungary's boldness allowed
East Germans -- skilled East Germans -- to exit in large number to
Austria during their ostensible "vacations" to Hungarian resorts.
They transited Austria to West Germany where they had guaranteed
citizenship, and were assured employment because of their skill-set.
This massive population flow of skilled workers is what ultimately
lead to East German collapse and the subsequent German re-unification.
It was Hungarian and Austrian policy co-operation that allowed Germany
to re-join its two halves.  A co-operation that flowed from an
extended period of Austrian investment in Hungarian enterprise.
(I guess Germany owes Hungary one for that.)  But the "unification" does lead to some interesting problems, as the
non-migratory East German population -- the ones whose skills were not
as marketable;  or alternatively, those who had valuable skills but
were philosophically aligned with the old regime -- are absorbed into
the Western EU fabric. Assimilation can be a very difficult process when attempts are made to
integrate into the German economy those who choose _not_ to migrate
especially if they are either unfit for, or opposed to their
Liberators.  Eliminating communism did not eliminate the communists.
If Burwitz gets briefed on some history, I'm sure that many things
will fall into context for him, and there will be a greater
understanding of the enemy that he's teaching people to fight.  It's
always good to understand the scope of a problem before you attack it.
That can only help with gaol achievement.
I don't think that "investors" are ever reticent about exploiting
opportunities -- if they are in fact welcome to, and not locked out.  Unfortunately many opportunities are only extended by
invitation to a select group of friends and not to an open field.
This is true in Europe as well as anywhere in the world.  Politicians
as an example get access to certain opportunities -- Hillary Clinton's
futures investments, or the Canadian equivalent, Alberta Premier Ralph
Klein's wife's investment in Multi-Corp, as an example.
At it's extreme, Kaciban is correct, this can lead to rampant
corruption, something which is best prevented.  But that is not the
situation we are faced with in the East.  In the East, there is an
understanding that business is about relationships and understandings.
Working relationships.
Anyone that a firm would expect to have a contract with, isn't
probably someone you should be sharing a bed with -- as they say -- in
the first place.
Some teachings also probably don't translate well for the American
instructors.  Cultural differences and expectations, as an example,
which are born out of history.
While the idea of a Russian RICO is interesting, it's not overly
realistic.  RICO is meant for a region that has established rules of
engagement -- the breach of which calls for quick "rubber-hose"
justice to ensure the system continues to function.  RICO is best
reserved, in that sense for a litigious America, to make sure that
everyone remembers where their allegiance should lie.
It has very little applicability in a chaotic system.  Not only is
there nothing to "preserve" -- but it truly begs the question of who'd
administer a Russian RICO?  You can't expect someone who's earning the equivalent of $50/month
not to supplement their official "pay".
Yep.  This is a very serious problem.  Some circles have suggested that the Russian nationalist Zhirinovsky
is involved in some fashion in these syndicates; they've drawn a
parallel to Sinn Fein.
Others think that there is a utilization of KGB remnants (including
those former communists which have now been _absorbed_ into the
"unified" Germany, and continue to hold positions of power there).
They believe that these sympathizers wish to restore and rebuild
Mother Russia and the old social state.  Some believe that these elements -- those that have a political /
nationalistic allegiance -- are very friendly with the Eastern
European crime syndicates.  A reciprocal arrangement, if you will.
One thing is clear.  Whether or not any of the foregoing hold, or
whether or not this syndicate's motivations are capitalistic or
nationalistic -- their tentacles extend worldwide.  Not only through a
Moscow - St.Petersberg - Frankfurt - Brussels backbone, but even into
the heartland of the United States.
Hard to believe??
The FBI (I think) has identified about 220 "Eurasian" (mostly Russian)
gangs operating in 17 U.S. cities in 14 states.  And I believe they've
identified 5,700 crime gangs in the former Soviet Union (which is up
_significantly_ from the 785 identified in 1991).
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs has estimated that gangs in
the former USSR employ about 100,000 _full-time_ members and an
estimated 3,000,000 part-timers.
These gangs' tentacles even by FBI estimates extend worldwide.  The FBI (again) said that Russian gangs are entrenched in 29 foreign
countries and maintain contacts with nearly 100,000 criminal
enterprises worldwide ranging from illegal alien smuggling rings, and
drug gangs, through the child prostitution trade in China and
Southeast Asia.
If these enterprises are even somewhat loosely organized -- as Sinn
Fein was -- then they probably have access to good crypto.  Very good
crypto.  There can be no question of that.
The belief that this syndicate is composed solely of thugs is actually
The ISSA (Information Systems Security Association) has suggested that
these transnational gangs employ out of work or underemployed Russian
scientists, mathematicians and computer experts, who earn as _little_ as
$50 to $100 a month in their legitimate jobs because of inflation of
Russia's currency.  The ISSA, has written that these specialist scientists penetrate the
Internet's global web of more than 60,000 computer networks.  Radicals
even suggest that this group is unique in having access to their own
constellations and communications systems -- but I personally think
that could only be civilian speculation.
This group is well organized, well financed and has a breadth and
depth of manpower that has never before been confronted.
The idea that those Russians who now winter at St. Tropez and who have
joined Monte Carlo cafe society must simply be very effective
"capitalists" doesn't float.  They are true natural talents who
understand the financial system and its networks -- personal networks,
financial networks, and silicon networks.
The former Russian bankers who managed the countries Gold & Oil Sales,
the ones who achieved understandings with De Beer's, the ones who
managed Soviet international FOREX operations, and the ones who
visited with Armand Hammer, and learned from him personally, probably
had some sophistication in these matters.  They've "dirtied" their hands with matters of Western finance, before.
If they or their lieutenants have donated their talents to these
enterprises, then Burwitz truly has his work cut out for him in
educating and training at the new FBI School.  He's not just facing some Caspian caviar smugglers.  He's up against
some of the finest talent available.
A far worse scenario can come forward than Milan's.
Let's suppose that the other side not only has complete familiarity
with your arsenal of investigatory and evidentiary tools, but also has
a superior knowledge of your own systems and their vulnerabilities, --
a knowledge that is superior to that you yourself possess.
Let's assume that while you were building your systems, hard and soft
systems, the other side has been studying them -- looking for holes
and vulnerabilities, and quietly documenting them.  Taking an action, no different than your very own study of their
systems, actually.
Now lets suppose that you destroy the other side's system, and cause
economic collapse, social chaos, and national humiliation, while
preserving your own system.  An attempt at supremacy through "other
means".  Have you not invited a retaliatory attack?  Some might suggest that you have ...
Not that Eastern syndicate elements might wish to see the disease
which has effected post-Soviet Russia propagate.  A share in the taste of it.  They're too busy tasting what was promised to them by the Voice of America and living the life of a model capitalist -- one of the characters from Dynasty.
Groups such as the Congress of Russian Communities, and the decorated
Afghan war hero, Gen. Alexander Lebed -- who Yeltsin asked to resign
as commander of the 14th Russian Army following Lebed's criticism of
the Kremlin -- certainly would have nothing to gain by retaliating in
kind to the disease introduced into the Motherland.
Striking at the state's head, clearly didn't solve this problem.
The essential "talent" has simply re-organized into a new structure,
one which is not under any central command or control hierarchy or
authority.  Simple chaotic self-interests organizing and emerging.
Certainly upcoming Presidential Elections in June and November won't
play a part in this.
"I treat the word democracy with respect," fourty-five year-old Lebed told the newspaper Segodya recently.  "But I am sure democracy will not be established within my lifetime.  Our country is such that democracy will have to be built by authoritarian methods."
Luckily, for all of us, President Boris Yeltsin is firmly in control.  He has little to fear.  Some people might be looking for a parallel to
MacArthur / Truman, in this instance.  But I personally wouldn't hang
my hat on that hope.
Lebed certainly wouldn't subscribe to Douglas MacArthur's statement
after he was relieved of command in the Far East, in 1951, when he
said, "I find in existence a new and heretofore unknown and dangerous
concept that the members of our armed forces owe primary allegiance or
loyalty to those who temporarily exercise the authority of the
Executive Branch of the Government rather than to the country and its
constitution which they swore to defend.  No proposition could be more
The April/May ISSA Password had this to say.
     "Unless something is done by law enforcement and private security
     agencies on a global scale to deter these Russian criminals, they
     will be looting banks, corporations, and government agencies of
     billions of dollars -- without using guns or the traditional
     methods.  Their modus operandi will be to rely solely on computer
     keyboards and the Internet.
     In an article published in the February 6, 1995, issue of the
     "Washington Times," international security expert and former
     Times editor-in-chief Arnaud de Borchgrave said: (sic)
     "Cyberspace detectives" report that financial thefts by Russian
     organized crime hackers on the Internet last year exceeded an
     estimated $5 Billion in the United States alone.
     Furthermore, he reports that about $300 million in untraceable
     computer transfers have vanished during the past two months
     (Jan/Feb 95) from banks and securities firms based on the East
     and West coasts of the U.S.
I think in February (1995), the CIA and the National Security Agency
(NSA) warned in a joint security report that, "The security of
information systems and networks is the major security challenge of
this decade and possibly the next century."
Burwitz faces a challenge.  If you face talent, information, money,
and organization, while you can't even get your ducks lined up, if you
can't maintain team discipline, then you might pretty well surrender.
You've already ceded much of the high ground, as Burwitz can probably
To prevent the accusation of being a "red-baiter" perhaps, I might say
that Mao Tse Tung, himself once noted:
   "Some people are intelligent in knowing themselves but stupid in
   knowing their opponents, and others the other way round; neither
   kind can solve the problem of learning and applying the laws of war."
And to close, a return to de Borchgrave, who according to ISSA
     "And it's not juvenile hackers who are committing these crimes.
     "Those doing it for the sheer pleasure of causing chaos on the
     net -- usually very young super-hackers -- have rapidly become
     the minority," one cyber detective told de Borchgrave.
     "Transnational crime gangs operating on several continents at
     almost the speed of light are now the main problems."

@_subject: Re: [NOISE] Re: FW: websurfer 4.6 
Java was not designed from the ground up with security in mind. Not by
a long shot.  It was an incubator project.  I know that.  And the Java
team knows that as well.  And the ones who WERE raving about Java -- myself and others -- might
simply be attempting to speak to Sun through some non-public channels.
I, as an example, have tried to speak with my local Sun software
manager, Warren Strange, about Java and voice some of my concerns,
that way.
(Yep, that's his name ... "STRANGE" ... what else would you expect
with a company who's Canadian subsidiary is run by an "Everett", and
who has a Vice-President named "Tribble".)
Mind you ... I got absolutely _nowhere_ with Mr. Strange.  I think he said that James Gosling was WAY too busy (as was he), and
that the last time he had checked Gosling had 800 email messages in
his mailbox, and that I should probably post my questions to
comp.lang.java, if I expected any answers.  I really didn't have the heart to tell him, that I generally avoid
comp altogether, and stick primarily to the alt hierarchy --
especially alt.fan.alt.bigfoot.  Strange as that might seem.
Then again, I tried to have a bit of quiet time with Everett after
Monday's Christmas party, but he never had any time for me.  Too busy,
I guess.  He was running off to shoot snooker with some of the boys
from Oracle, I think.
I think that takes precedence over customer concerns.
But the party was a smash.  They even had a guy doing magic tricks.
Shame I didn't bring any business cards with me to a social occassion.
Guess, I just wasn't trained right.
But I _did_ get a nifty Java T-shirt and a snazzy pin.  So it was
worth it.  And the smoked salmon was an unexpected surprise in "It had
better be Beef" Alberta.  It was a very nice touch.
I also tried to talk to a Sales Representative (grin) about this --
about Java security.  Poor man.  I think he was almost tearful, when
he snapped at me, "Why don't you attack Microsoft instead??"
So, I guess I might just do that, here.
Does anyone besides me, see a sucker-punch in Microsoft's announced
support for Java??  Support for a competitor's product??  I certainly
do, especially from the way I saw the press presentations fly out over
the airwaves.  The media coverage seemed not to convey the "right" touch of
It seems like Gates wants to support and promote a product as being
appropriate for something that it isn't suited for, and isn't designed
for, while having his very own own fall-back position with VB.
A sucker-punch.  Or at least that was my perception of it.  I don't
know about anyone else, here.
I wonder whether anyone from Sun smells a rat in Microsoft going this
route.  It seemed grossly out of character, for Microsoft.  Major
paradigm shifts such as this are truly unusual for large firms.
Especially Microsoft's IETF comments.
The frosting was just a little too sugary and thick, I think.
It worries me when a company promotes another company's product
heavily, while only embracing it partially.  Then again, what would I know.  I can get suckered into writing about
Microsoft's puffery by a single tearful Sun salesman.
Well, that, and some smoked salmon ... guess that rules me out for a
security clearance, huh??

I've just released details of an attack many of you will find interesting since quite a few existing cryptography products and systems are potentially at risk.  The general idea of the attack is
that secret keys can be found by measuring the amount of time used to
to process messages.  The paper describes attacks against RSA, fixed-
exponent Diffie-Hellman, and DSS, and the techniques can work with many other systems as well. My research on the subject is still in progress and the current paper does not include many of my findings.  I will eventually publish a full paper, but am releasing a preliminary draft now to alert the community as quickly as possible.  A copy of the abstract is attached at the end of this message and the full text can be downloaded in PostScript format from:
  ftp://ftp.cryptography.com/pub/kocher_timing_attack.ps
  ftp://ftp.cryptography.com/pub/kocher_timing_attack.ps.gz
I've also made an HTML version which is accessible at:
  (The HTML uses subscripts and superscripts which aren't supported in older web browsers.  The PostScript version is the "official" one and looks nicer.)
The results have already been seen by Matt Blaze, Martin Hellman, Ron Rivest, Bruce Schneier, and many others.  While the full significance
of the attack is not yet known, I think everyone who has seen it considers it important (including Netscape who awarded me a $1000 bugs bounty prize).     ABSTRACT.  Cryptosystems often take slightly different     amounts of time to process different messages. With network-
    based cryptosystems, cryptographic tokens, and many other     applications, attackers can measure the amount of time used     to complete cryptographic operations.  This abstract shows     that timing channels can, and often do, leak key material.      The attacks are particularly alarming because they often     require only known ciphertext, work even if timing     measurements are somewhat inaccurate, are computationally     easy, and are difficult to detect.  This preliminary draft     outlines attacks that can find secret exponents in Diffie-
    Hellman key exchange, factor RSA keys, and find DSS secret     parameters.  Other symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic     functions are also at risk. A complete description of the     attack will be presented in a full paper, to be released     later. I conclude by noting that closing timing channels     is often more difficult than might be expected. Paul Kocher

Double Plus Ungood Thought Crime Regulations Unchallenged
By Asphyxiated Press, 02/08/96
PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The government's ban on sending "incendiary"
and politically explicit material to minors over computer networks
was unchallenged in court the moment President Clinton signed it
into law Thursday.
The Justice Department pledged not to initiate prosecutions for
a week, and a federal judge declined to temporarily block the
Decency Act, giving prosecutors until Wednesday to collect names
of subversives.
Thanks to a last-minute addition by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., it
also extends a rarely enforced, 123-year-old law into cyberspace, making it a violation of obscenity laws to use computers to
to teach evolutionary theory.
Supporters say the law will protect children from pornography,
drug traffickers, cryptographers, and evolutionists.
U.S. Attorney Anthony J. Coppolino, said restrictions are necessary
because computers have become increasingly pervasive and bring
thoughtcrime right into people's homes.
``It's not an exaggeration to say that many of these incendiary
ideas are available on a computer by ... a click of a mouse,''
said Coppolino.
Coppolino also told U.S. District Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter that the Justice Department will stand by its longstanding policy
``unchristian speech will be vigorously prosecuted.''
The Clinton Administration has also repeatedly raised concerns
about the constitutionality of the evolution provisions, as it
wasn't immediately clear how they conflicted with the teachings of
Adam Smith.
Vice President Al Gore dodged the question Thursday when asked by The Associated Press in Washington which side the Justice
department would support.
``We're obligated to follow orders, but we said from the
start this particular provision will not contradict NAFTA,''
Gore responded.
Coppolino said the contested provisions will not be enforced
until at least Wednesday, but gave no assurances that people who
use the Internet over the next few days would not be persecuted
in the future for freethinking.
The law prohibits all ``speech about sex other than "lie down and
think of George Washington".''  Sen. Jim Exon, D-Neb., who sponsored
the wide-ranging Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996, expressed
confidence in the anti-pleasure provisions.
``The Goldsteinists continues to raise red herrings that have nothing
to do with our proposal,'' he said. ``The legislation will not ban
works of Ingsoc or reminders to contribute to the Party.''
Cathy Cleaver, a lawyer with the Family Research Council in Washington,
compared the new act to the existing sedition law, which requires all
unbaptised persons to be tattooed with an identification number -
to keep minors from communicating with subversives.

Concerning the ITAR ...... what would happen if some Evil Hacker Dude in,

that ...... but if those ping packets contained little pieces of something
like PGP ...... would the host being pinged be breaking the law? Would
all the hosts in the route between that host and the host in England that

Impossible, maybe. But that doesn't mean it can't be illegal. Take the CDA, for example. Fuck. Oops, Exon will be displeased. Am I going to be taken to jail? Most likely not. Was it illegal? Technically, yes.

@_subject: Re: Internet Privacy Guaranteed ad (POTP Jr.) 
We can be generous and characterize this as a typo.  If N is the length
in bytes, then the number of possible such messages is of course 256 to
the Nth power, not N to the 256th power as the message says.  For N=1,
for example, 256 to the Nth is 256, while N to the 256th is 1, and of
course there are 256 possible one-byte messages, not 1.
The wording is a little unclear, so let me offer this proposed
clarification, and see if IPG would agree.  It is a slight rewording of
what they wrote but I think means the same as what they said:
I haven't followed the IPG discussion, but if their cipher actually does
satisfy this criterion it would be at least pretty close to a one-time
One definition of a OTP is that the output tells you nothing about the
input (except its length).  For any given output, all possible input
messages of that length are equally possible.
The definition proposed by IPG is similar to this; they say that for a
given output, the input could be any message of that length (at least, I
think that is what they are saying).  To be really as strong as a OTP
they should further have it that all these possible inputs are equally
probable.  However I suspect that if they can actually arrange that all
inputs are possible, then they will actually be equiprobable.
It follows from their definition that for a given plaintext message,
all possible cyphertexts of that length might result.  (Because if there
was some ciphertext that didn't result from a given plaintext, then for
that ciphertet message it would not be the case that the plaintext might
be any of the 256 to the Nth possibilities; it could not be that one.)
One thing I don't quite understand is whether keys are in fact reused
from message to message.  If the system is capable of encrypting, say, a
2K byte message such that all possible 2K byte cyphertexts might result,
then it should be capable of encrypting two 1K byte messages such that
the outputs are unrelated even if the inputs are the same.  So I don't
see why a system capable of satisfying the definition above would reuse
Can we agree that if the IPG system meets the definition they offered
(as clarified here) it would be as good as a OTP?

It's GAK (GAK!). Instead of one arm of the government
supposedly holding keys safe from unauthorized access by
another arm of the government, it will be a duly approved,
registered, regulated repository holding keys safe from unauthorized access by an arm of the government. Just like banks protect customers' funds and privacy... Gee! It sure sounds like utopia to me... utopia for government. Does anyone know of ANY regulated industry that exists at the pleasure of the government that also strenuously defends its customers' rights against government efforts? I think not.
There is no difference between the justification for this and what was offered to justify Clipper.  "Other adversaries," like those who want to keep their affairs private, or wish to live free in an increasingly unfree world? I think I'm gonna puke.
I AM gonna puke. Of COURSE most governments will go for this! The practical effect is essentially the same as if all paper mail were to be machine-copied and archived, only accessible with a "proper court order." Even though the government can go after your mail now, lawfully or UNlawfully, if they don't, it's gone -- it has no persistence in any system not under the control of sender or receiver, and as a practical matter ALL paper mail cannot be copied and archived by any third party. However, e-mail is rapidly replacing paper mail and some supposed advocates of crypto are helping the government ensure that MAIL of the future will have the potential to be a persistent "e-trail," something that paper mail could never be.
Yeah, I guess all the programmers in the world who DON'T work for Microsloth are just too darned stupid to have conceived of any such separation. Thank goodness MS made this possible! Now we can dispense with all those foolish delusions we once harbored and admit that all the DOS offline mail readers in the world that supported a configurable editor only *appeared* to interface to third-party crypto modules via editor interface layers... Now we can admit that we were mistaken in believing that Pegasus Mail was trivially equipped with a generic crypto interface and that an interface layer to PGP was released by another party within weeks...
What self-serving bullshit.
Yeah, this is a really good reason to flush privacy in communications down the toilet of subservience to limitless government. Really.
Of course. A remarkable arrogation of power rather than a concession: Laying the foundation for ALL communications to be available with a warrant, something the government has NEVER in its history enjoyed.
They were right and you are wrong in asserting that it would be "forever." These things solve themselves in time as
long as there is a plurality of political systems and national
interests on the planet. No government on earth can long
stand against irresistible forces.
Sure. So throw in the towel, eh? If you can't fight 'em, JOIN 'em. Right? That may be a compelling argument in favor of finding ways to send wakeup calls to the political machinery -- the kinds of calls that cause severe loss of sleep and the eruption of multitudinous beads of sweat -- but it is HARDLY an argument in favor of signing on, as it were, to GAK.
What you mean, "Us," kimosabe? This whole piece you've written
is a superficial rationalization for shitcanning principle when
it is placed in opposition to corporate survival by presumed
higher authority. If this is the "long-sought compromise"
that "gets us through this morass," it is a textbook example
of the "turd in the punchbowl" dilemma. How small a turd
will you compromise on before you will consider the punch fit
to drink? Rather a large one, evidently. Then again, this
could be because you see yourself more as a purveyor of punch
than an imbiber. History repeats itself. Endlessly.
What on earth gives you the idea that anyone outside
government wants to "ensure that governments have access when
justified?" Most individuals would prefer to have and use the
means to ensure that *no one* has access to their private
communications, "justified" or not. More death, torture,
mulilation, incarceration and confiscation have been
perpetrated by governments "justified" by laws valid in their
time and place than all the harm ever done by all the private
individuals in history. What is today's "justification" could well become tomorrow's crime against humanity.
If you're right, then maybe the whole thing needs to be dismantled and built again from the ground up. Really.
Yes -- the path of totalitarianism, apparently.
False. Suppose you and your spouse wish to remain inviolate but the guy in the ski mask wants to sodomize you both? To your way of thinking, "that path has to accomodate us all if we are ever to arrive at any mutually agreeable destination."  Good fucking luck.
Although it's possible this may never have occurred to you,
maybe those who want to see strong crypto freely available
would prefer that as long as the U.S. insists on maintaining
self-destructive crypto policies they impact U.S. industry and
provide incentive for foreign crypto development rather than
see U.S. industry crawl supine and subservient to lick the
shoes of bureaucrats who are, after all, our employees and
(supposedly) our SERVANTS.  What you are doing is going into agreement with the government and helping to take the pressure off the government, when what is really called for is a firm stand that keeps the responsibility for the consequences squarely where it belongs: on government hands. Caving while pretending to adhere to principle fosters that to which one caves. Standing firm is much more likely to force a change.  You've CHOSEN to be in a business whose market reach is at the pleasure of the government. Not satisfied with the reach allowed you, you jump through quite a few logical hoops to rationalize why it's ok to tailor principle to the necessities attendant to navigating the obstacles to which you voluntarily made yourself subject in the first place. Perhaps you can see why I wouldn't trust you with the keys to my car, much less my
The two have no natural connection. The unnatural connection

connection established by a kidnapper between failure to meet

As far as exportable crypto in [our] lifetime... that will
take care of itself without your help. What you are doing
will DELAY it by appearing to address important issues while
in reality severely damaging the principle of maintaining
freedom of encryption by helping to establish a system in
which that freedom will not exist. Thanks, but no thanks.
No way, Jose! Most people who want it have access to PGP now, and already are using it with their favorite applications. The future can offer only more and better, regardless of present government policies.
Pegasus Mail showed that integration is not a big deal if
the software originates outside the U.S., so the direction is
established and obvious: As the many millions of programmers
around the world develop more and more advanced applications,
those apps increasingly will tend to have crypto interfaces. Those interested in crypto will buy foreign products. In the ABSENCE of efforts such as yours, the pressure on the U.S. government would rapidly become irresistible.
Yes indeed, and I have not the slightest desire to help you help the government institutionalize a bad policy.

What is ONE-PHONE-CALL?
ONE-PHONE-CALL is a PC-based software product that enables you to transfer electronic information such as a program, a scanned fax, a word-processing document or a spreadsheet to someone, in a secure environment, with just one telephone call. It features a simple installation, user-friendly interface, mouse support, a menu system, and easy-to-remember commands.
First, Some Background
More and more of our correspondence is electronic in nature.  We use word processors to compose letters and reports.  We use spreadsheets to do budgets and financial analysis and we use accounting programs to keep track of everything from the corporate books to our personal checking accounts.
The power of these software tools is easily appreciated and the trend is to use our computers in meeting more and more of our daily needs.  What is lacking, however, is a simple, easy-to-use method of sharing our electronic information with each other. Using the facilities of fax, EMail or floppy disks has problems.  A fax can only transmit printed information, EMail is difficult to use and can be expensive, and mailing floppy disks is very slow.  Also, none of these methods is very secure.  The wrong people can read a fax, open business mail, or gain access to voice-mail or EMail Now with your modem equipped computer and ONE-PHONE-CALL you can addresses all of these issues.
Let's illustrate with three examples:
The first example demonstrates the simplest issue: sharing electronic information with someone else.
You are working on a report at home and need to confer with a co-worker in the office.  You place a telephone call to your co-worker and discuss the report.  You decide he needs to see a copy of the report.
Without ONE-PHONE-CALL it might go like this:
To fax a copy of the report you might:
... Print out the report on your printer
... Dial his fax number
... Fax the report
... Call him back to tell him the fax has been sent
... Wait for him to get the fax and call you back!
The result - at least three phone calls and who knows how much time wasted in printing, faxing, perhaps getting busy signals and so on.
Or perhaps you decide to send him an electronic version of the report, via his EMail account. You might:
... Format the document properly for the EMail service to accept
... Dial the EMail service, connect, log-in, and all the rest
... Transmit the report
... Call him back to tell him the report is on the EMail service
... Your co-worker connects to the EMail service
... He downloads the report
... He calls you back.
At least four phone calls!  And who knows how much money and effort?
Now with ONE-PHONE-CALL, you can accomplish the same task with your original phone call.  You and your co-worker can stay on the phone and transfer the information back and forth as many times as necessary, without having to make another phone call!
A second example demonstrates a more complex problem.  The ability to transfer information when you don't know exactly what information needs to be You have just received a copy of a great new shareware game from the XYZ Software Company.  Your brother shares your liking for this company's software and you have exchanged previous shareware games with him.  It's a great game and you're pretty sure he'll want a copy too.
Without ONE-PHONE-CALL, you have two obvious choices.  First, you could upload all the software to his EMail account (see above!) and maybe call him to tell him it's there, or you could copy the software to a floppy disk and mail it to him.  If you go the EMail route, you're out the upload time and several dollars. (So is he, on the other end.)  If you go with the Postal Service, you're out a buck or so for a floppy and some postage and the software gets there days later.
With ONE-PHONE-CALL, it's as simple as calling him, finding out if he wants the software, and sending it right then and there!  ONE-PHONE-CALL will even figure out what software he needs (perhaps several of the files are the same as in previous games) and will only send the new files that he doesn't have, and update any files that are out-of-date.
We can extend this example to many specific problem areas:
You own a software company that operates a customer service line for help with your products.  If your customer needs an updated version of the software, you can upload the new software to him immediately, sending him only what he needs, during the one phone call the customer has made to your company.  Result! a happy customer.
A friend is having a problem with his computer.  You suspect he may have a problem with one of his configuration files such as CONFIG.SYS,  AUTOEXEC.BAT or one of his Windows INI files. Without using the capabilities of ONE-PHONE-CALL he is either reading you the text of the file over the phone (yea, right!) or he is printing it out to fax it or mail it to you.  You get the listing (maybe days from now) and find the problem.  You need him to edit his CONFIG.SYS file to fix the problem. "How do I do that?"  he asks. You get the idea.
With ONE-PHONE-CALL, he simply sends you the files, you edit them on your computer, and send them back, he reboots, and the problem is solved.  All with ONE-PHONE-CALL.
Our final example highlights the security aspects of electronic information Have you ever sent a fax and wondered if it went to the wrong machine?  Did you dial that number correctly?  Or did you wonder if it was "eaten" by the machine? or was read by the wrong people? or fell into the "black hole" of cyberspace?  Have you ever wanted to send some confidential information but didn't "quite trust" your on-line service?  Have you ever wanted to make sure the right person and ONLY that person sees your communication?  Without ONE-PHONE-CALL, the electronic exchange of confidential information  can be very difficult.  With ONE-PHONE-CALL, your life just got much easier.
Here's a hyperbolic example but it makes the point:
You have been away at your summer retreat working on the company annual report and budget.  It is FULL of confidential information.  You need to send it to your CFO back at the office for review and the insertion of some background information that he has in his computer.  How do you get it to With ONE-PHONE-CALL, you call his office, get him on the phone, and send the document!  You KNOW you dialed the right number.  You KNOW you have the right person on the line. And by using the encryption feature of the software, you can even deter access to your information in the event of a wiretap.
How do you do that without ONE-PHONE-CALL?

Clinton worried Internet may help arm terrorists
TOKYO, April 17 (Reuter) - U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Wednesday he
was worried the Internet was aiding international terrorism by making it too
easy for sinister forces to learn how to make bombs or produce nerve gas.
"Are people learning, for example, from the Internet how to make the same
sort of trouble in the United States that was made in Japan with sarin gas?"
Clinton said at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in Tokyo.
"Isn't it a concern that anybody, anywhere in the world, can pull down off
the Internet the information about how to build a bomb like the bomb that blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City?" he added.
Clinton said Japan and the United States, both victims of home-grown
terrorism last year, should learn from each other about how to deal with the
In the United States anti-government groups are linked "like no rebel force
has ever been" by the Internet and fax, the Southern Poverty Law Center, a group which campaigns for civil rights, said in a report released last week.
Anti-government right-wing activism has been linked to the Oklahoma blast
in which a truck bomb destroyed a federal building and killed 168 people on
April 19, 1995.
Information on how to construct a similar bomb is available to anyone
around the world with Internet access.
Meanwhile in Japan, the doomsday cult Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth Sect)
was able to download from the Internet a formula for synthesising green-mamba
snake venom, according to a recent magazine report.
The sect is also believed to have been looking to procure samples of the
lethal ebola virus.
Cult leader Shoko Asahara goes on trial on April 24 charged with the murder
of 25 people, including 11 who died in a sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo
subway on March 20, 1995.
About 5,000 other commuters where taken ill in the incident.
     Clinton also told the news conference that in the next 20 years "every
great nation will have to face" the question of terrorist access to the
 Clinton called acts of terrorism, whether home-grown or international, "a
genuine threat not only to the lives of the innocent civilians who may be killed in them, but to the whole idea of an open, civilised society in a global economy."
Clinton's comments on the Internet were in response to a question about his
thoughts on terrorism.
He said nations must ask "how can we work together to learn with each other
about how to prevent these things before they occur, when they're purely
domestically driven, as well as sharing information and technology and law
enforcement about the international terrorist networks that are out there?"

[Page S3454-S3478]
              TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT
  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.
(A bunch deleted.  Here's one of the interesting parts  -AT)
  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, what I would like to speak to in an
indirect way covers this. We have had several votes on wiretaps, and
I know people are asking why am I introducing the other wiretap
provision that was taken out of the Senate bill. The reason I am is
I refuse to believe that, if you all hear this enough, you will not
eventually decide to do the right thing on this.
  The provision that I have proposed is not original with me. It was
in the Senate bill that we passed. The provision would add a
number--the bill we have before us, the conference report--would add
a number of terrorism-related offenses to the law. I will go into
those in a minute. What I have sent to the desk, if adopted, would
instruct the conferees to add the same number of offenses that we
are adding to the bill, to the law, to those categories of things
for which the Government, with probable cause, can get a wiretap. It
was in the Senate bill as introduced by Senators Hatch and Dole. It
was part of the terrorism bill reported out of Representative Hyde's
Judiciary Committee. Unfortunately, by the time the bill had made it
to the House, the provision was dropped.
  I think it is worth talking a moment about how a wiretap statute
works, the one that is in place now in the law, for it seems there
is a lot of misunderstanding about it these days. I am repeating
myself again to eliminate the misunderstanding. As some people tell
it, you would think the FBI and BATF and the local and State police
are tapping our phones left and right, that they are riding down the
streets in vans with electronic devices eavesdropping into our
windows and houses--which they have the capacity to do, by the way.

According to a report released by the prestigious Jane's Defense Weekly, the
new missile agreement between Israel and the United States is politically
motivated and does not hold water.
Mr. Christopher Fosi, an Editor of the Jane's Defense Weekly, and Mr.
Douglas Barry,  Aviation and Defense Editor of Flight International Weekly
Magazine,   stated the Nautilus Anti-Missile System is at least 4 years from
being ready. The report states the system is "a poor fit or just does not meet Israel's
needs". The report explains that since the Katusha rockets are launched from
mobile sites, they can be moved around in a pick-up truck and this is just
one reason the system is ineffective. Fosi discounts tests that were carried
out in Mexico as not accurate and stated the reasons behind the ceremony
surrounding the new missile deal appear to be political in nature, rather
than a military-defensive move to protect Israel from Hizbullah rockets. The report also explains that Israel's Arrow Anti-Missile System is also not
designed for Katusha rockets and is not an effective deterrent.  Despite
promises by President Clinton to supply Israel with an operational Nautilus
system by late 1997, the two experts state it is not reality. (UPI..4/30,

Financial Times, 6 May 1996
Internet provider to launch censorship
By James Mackintosh in London
Unipalm Pipex, the biggest provider of Internet access to
British businesses, has acceded to government calls for
voluntary censorship in a significant boost to ministerial
attempts to restrict access to electronic pornography.
Pipex is to block much of the worst child pornography from
subscribers and will also be supplying new software to allow
companies to limit the parts of the Internet - the international computer network - accessible by staff.
The decision is likely to have far-reaching implications for
the Internet in Britain because Mr Peter Dawe, managing
director of Pipex, is also political officer of the Internet
Service Providers' Association, the body negotiating a
voluntary code of conduct with the government.
Until recently Mr Dawe was opposed to any form of censorship.
But he has now decided to stop supplying discussion groups -
which are devoted to pictures of young children.
The software package will allow subscribers to block parts of
the Internet considered unsuitable, making them accessible
only with a password. As a result, parents will be able to
control which parts of the Internet are available to children,
and managers to ensure staff are not breaking the law.
However, Mr Dawe emphasised the impossibility of completely
blocking offensive parts of the Internet.
Pipex - the UK arm of UUNet of the US - does not expect a
backlash from users over the censorship. Mr Dawe said he was
sure Pipex's corporate users "would be horrified" at what is
available on the Internet. He said that if pornographic
pictures were found on office computers, companies could be
open to prosecution.
Cambridge-based Pipex, which claims more than 60 per cent of
the UK's corporate Internet users, selected which news groups
to block after seeking the advice of police at Scotland Yard
in London. The Obscene Publications Squad confirmed that child
pornography on the Internet had already become a serious
problem. "The majority of the people we deal with have used
news groups," he said. Child pornography had become available
to people who a few years ago would not have known how to find
The approach Pipex has taken fits with the government's
preferred option of a voluntary code of conduct for Internet
providers, leaving censorship matters to users.

Theories on cause of Colby death abound
By Christopher Ruddy
FOR THE TRIBUNE-REVIEW
WASHINGTON - The body of "the Old Gray Man of the CIA," William Colby,
has been found in waters near his
weekend home, but theories about his demise continue to thrive.
Colby, who served as CIA director under Presidents Nixon and Ford,
disappeared April 28. Maryland authorities found
his body Monday morning after it washed ashore. This followed an
intensive search of the Wimcoico River near Colby's
home in Rock Point, Md. Local police believe his body was lost in the
cloudy waters of the Wicomico while canoeing, a
favorite pastime of Colby's.
At 76, Colby was physically fit and, after surviving parachute drops
behind Nazi lines in War World II and stints in
Vietnam, he was a cautious, careful and cunning man who lived up to
his James Bond super-spy credentials. Last week, The New York Post's irreverent Page Six raised concerns
about Colby's disappearance and apparent death
with an article headlined "Conspiracy Crowd Snatches Colby." "The
theory among conspiracy-minded, cloak-and-dagger
buffs is that Colby was assassinated so he wouldn't spill any more
agency secrets," the gossip page began. Agency
insiders reportedly resented Colby for talking to Congress about the
"family jewels" - supposed illegal operations the
agency conducted in the decades before Watergate. As a result, Colby
lost the support of agency insiders and the Ford
administration. President Ford fired Colby on Halloween 1975.
Some theorists point to the similar circumstances surrounding the 1978
death of CIA deputy director John A. Paisley.
Paisley's sailboat was found adrift in the Chesapeake Bay just 15
miles from Colby's home. His body was discovered
days later. He died of an apparent gunshot behind his ear. His body
had been weighted with diving belts. Since no blood
was found on the boat, authorities theorized Paisley first jumped into
the water and then fired the shot into his head.
However, murder was never ruled out in the case.
While some refuse to believe 20-year-old grudges could have led to
Colby's demise, others, including Fred Davis, the
Maryland county sheriff in charge of the probe, still find the death
suspicious and haven't ruled out foul play Already, the
death has been the buzz of talk radio and the Internet. Pittsburgh's
Jim Quinn on WRRK-FM joked that Colby's body
will rise to the top as soon as "someone cuts the concrete slabs tied
to his feet."
New York shock-jock Don Imus, whose recent roast of the Clintons
caused a stir, started off one of his morning
programs wondering what the "Whitewater" connection was with Colby's
death - a reference, no doubt, to the high
number of deaths likened to a web of Arkansas scandal. Even though
Imus didn't realize it, Colby did have a Whitewater
connection. For the past two years, he has been a contributing editor
with a monthly financial newsletter, Strategic
Investment. Co-edited by James Dale Davidson and former Times of
London editor Lord William Rees Mogg, Strategic
is read by more than 100,000 subscribers worldwide and has been
closely monitoring the Whitewater scandal. Davidson has written in the newsletter that Vincent Foster, former
White House deputy counsel, was murdered and that
significant evidence links the Clintons to drug trafficking, murder
and organized crime in their home state of Arkansas.
Foster was found shot to death more than two years ago in Fort Marcy
Park near Washington, D.C. The Wall Street
Journal editorialized that it was glad to see James Davidson "pushing
the envelope" on the Whitewater scandal.
Colby began taking a more active role in the newsletter in February,
writing a weekly column on geo-political matters and
their effects on investments in Strategic Weekly Briefings - a
facsimile newsletter tailored for high-income investors. Colby
traveled with Davidson several times to Asia, leading groups of
In his columns, Colby never touched upon the Clintons or the
Whitewater affair. His name and former association with the
CIA was no doubt a real credibility boost for the newsletter and was
touted throughout the newsletter and its promotional
brochures (which often detailed the newsletter's reporting of the
darker side of Whitewater). "I find the death suspicious
for a lot of reasons," Davidson told the Tribune-Review. He does not
link his Whitewater coverage to the death, but
points to problems associated with Colby's disappearance. "It's not
clear how his life jacket and paddle, which he always
took canoeing with him, disappeared,''he said. Davidson also is disturbed by an early Associated Press report quoting
Mrs. Colby as having spoken with her husband
on the day of the death. The AP reported that Colby said he was not
feeling well, but planned to go canoeing anyway. In
a statement this week, Mrs. Colby, who was in Texas when she spoke to
her husband for the last time, said he was
feeling fine, and never mentioned any plans to go canoeing. Davidson described Colby as a "charming and fit" man who had great
stamina traveling. "He was a New Deal Democrat
like many who started in the OSS (the forerunner to the CIA),"
Davidson remarked. According to Davidson, one of his
staff members contacted local police who said they were perplexed as
to where the AP got the original report on Colby's
conversation with his wife.
Some old Cold Warriors recollect Colby's longstanding feud with James
Jesus Angleton, the longtime head of the CIA's
counterintelligence division. Angleton believed the CIA had been
infiltrated by KGB moles; Colby believed Angleton had
become symptomatic of Cold War paranoia and forced his ouster in 1974.
After his dismissal, a bitter Angleton told
associates he believed that Colby had been recruited by the KGB and
was a long-term asset of the Soviets. Angelton's
supporters noted Colby's association with far left committees -
including ones supported by the Institute for Policy Studies
- after Colby departed from the CIA. Colby also called for near
unilateral disarmament - an immediate 50 percent
reduction in the American defense budget during the height of
East-West tensions.
One friend of Colby's scoffed at such notions and suggested that his
espousal of unorthodox views were not based on a
longtime hidden ideology, but may be explained by his desire to live
down an undesirable reputation he acquired in
Vietnam for heading up the controversial Operation Phoenix, a program
to eradicate peasant support of the Viet Cong,
for which Colby had been branded by war protesters as a war criminal.

@_subject: Report on Smart cards 
Financial Times, 13 May 1996
Smart cards poised to mark revolution in data protection
The poor image of the technology as "Big Brother's little
helper" may be altogether undeserved, says Alan Cane
The smart card -- a piece of plastic the size of a credit card
with a computer embedded in it -- offers numerous benefits,
but will force a re-evaluation of attitudes to privacy and
data protection, says Demos, the independent think-tank.
Its report, one of the first to analyse policy issues raised
by the rapid proliferation of smart cards in areas such as
finance, health and public administration, warns that the
benefits will only accrue when people are confident the
technology will not become "Big Brother s little helper", as
the authors put it.
Helpfully, Demos suggests policies to sidestep what it sees as
a "sterile confrontation" between civil libertarians and
authoritarian government and business interests in promoting
the benefits of smart cards.
"We have argued that people will trust in these technologies
when they can choose anonymity where they want it and have
greater control over the use of personal information held
about them," say the authors.
What distinguishes the smart card from other information
technologies and gives it its power is the capacity to
concentrate and manipulate a huge amount of information in a
tiny space.
A reading device is necessary to view the information, but
smart cards compute as well as store data. Software can be
incorporated to encode the data, rendering it unreadable to
anyone without the right key.
What can smart cards be used for? Their main use now is as
telephone cards for public pay-phones, but they have the
potential to identify individuals, to act as an electronic
wallet for cashless shopping, and to provide a secure and
portable information store. Medical histories could be stored
on a smart card, for example, ready for recall by a doctor.
Visionaries talk of virtually unlimited amounts of information
distributed through society in a variety of forms -- the
credit card model has been adopted for convenience rather than
because of limitations inherent in microcomputers. Badges,
pins and jewelry could all become "smart" accessories in the
However, this sort of crystalgazing raises questions. For
example, what information should be stored on a smart device?
Who should be able to read it? The Demos researchers are
critical of suggestions by Michael Howard, Britain's home
secretary, that a smart card could be used as a national
identity card: a government-issued, multi-functional card,
with the populace having little or no choice about which
applications were available on the card -- and perhaps no say
about the privacy system employed.
Regulation of the privacy system -- encryption -- is
important. It is comparatively easy to devise encryption
methods which are almost impossible to break within a
reasonable period. That worries governments fearful of being
unable to unpick communications from terrorists and the like.
The US has attempted to forbid the export of the more powerful
US cryptography systems.
The Demos researchers argue that such tactics are
counter-productive. They favour a private "key escrow", a
system where cryptography users deposit the key to their
system with a trusted private registry, approved and regulated
by governments. "Government law enforcement agencies would
have to obtain a court order on the basis that they had strong
reason to believe that an individual or company that had
escrowed their keys ... was guilty of some crime".
The report proposes a radical reform of data protection
legislation through some 10 supplementary conditions. Data
users, for example, would have to get express consent from
individuals for the use to which they would want to put the
data. Rules on disclosure to third parties would be tightened,
so that data users would have to receive specific permission
from a data protection registrar in order to gain access to
specific information.
It argues that individuals should be able to choose the card
they want, and decide what information and applications will
be loaded. "Where [Michael Howard's] card is an essentially
authoritarian instrument, our proposal is for a more
market-based instrument in which the role of government is to
align the incentives within the market to ensure privacy,
trust and individual access and control," says the report.

Elie Wiesel, guru of Humanism from Boston U., was more direct and explicitly called for an international police force to protect us from nuclear terrorists and other bogeymen.

This scenario is beginning to sound suspiciously similar each time
it happens:  an anonymous individual or individuals utilize a
remailer in a way that's deemed abusive, certain individuals
complain loudly, and the remailer (or mail2news gateway) either
shuts down or blocks the affected newsgroup.  Thus far I've seen it
happen with the alt.religion.scientology, alt.smokers, and
alt.syntax.tactical newsgroups.
This is setting a bad precedent.  It sends the message that you
merely have to fabricate a little "abuse" through one or more
remailers to get what you want -- the elimination of your opponents'
platform to dissent without fear of retribution.  Whether the abuse
in any of the aforementioned instances was actually fabricated or
not is immaterial.  If it wasn't, it very could have been, with
identical results in either case.  The problem being, with an
anonymous attack through a remailer and/or mail2news gateway, how do
you identify the intended victim?  Was it the NG or the
remailer/gateway itself?
The first two NGs have one striking similarity:  both involve a
product or service where those who stand to profit from it have
recently been plagued with "whistle blowers" and "defectors" from
among their ranks -- the CO$ and the tobacco industry.  In both
cases, those who've come forward and divulged secrets have reported
I'm at a loss to understand the blocking of the third NG,
alt.syntax.tactical, however, unless the intent was strictly
punitive.  I can't imagine anyone from a.s.t. coming forward to
complain about "abuse"!  That would be like complaining about foul
language on alt.blasphemy.

The Maryville-Alcoa (TN) Daily Times, June 3, 1996.
`Calvin' Decals Catching Some Heat
Auto displays may be deemed `obscene'
By Justin Cress
Tennessee motorists might need to be more discriminating in the
future about the statement their automobiles are making.
A recent warning issued to a South Carolina woman for displaying
an "obscene" bumper sticker has caused some controversy about
that state's obscenity laws.
Decals portraying Calvin, of Bill Waterson's popular "Calvin and
Hobbes" comic strip, urinating on assorted objects of ridicule
are sweeping the Southeast.  The decals' increased visibility
prompts the question:  Is it obscentity or simply bad taste?
Patti Redden of McConnells, S.C., was surprised to find, while
being stopped at a highway patrol checkpoint, that the
reproduction displayed in her rear window was considered
offensive and illegal according to state ordinances.  Her version
depicted the letters "IRS" receiving the Calvinesque treatment.
Like South Carolina, Tennessee's obscenity laws prohibit the use
of "patently offensive" stickers, window-signs, or other markings
on a motor vehicle.  An opinion handed down in 1989 by the state
defines patently offensive as "that which goes substantially
beyond customary limits of candor in describing or representing
such matters," especially when pertaining to excretory functions.
Sharon Curtis-Flair, public information officer of the Tennessee
Attorney General's Office, expects to see renewed interest in the
state's laws.
"We went through this before in 1988 with (another questionable
bumper sticker)," said Curtis-Flair.  "The law has really not
been tested yet.  It's just never been challenged."  (...)

Something like 10% of ALL public school students in Tennessee are on
Ritalin.  Presumably, the percentages are similar in other states.  I have trouble believing there are so many kids suddenly suffering from a disorder that wasn't even discovered until a few years ago.
The following rant from a Ritalin user may be of interest (though not too relevant to cryptography):
Occasionally I will see something about the practice of giving kids
RITALIN for alleged attention-deficit disorder. I can't think of better
evidence that the owners of the schools and the world are trying to
destroy the kids in this country.
I was big drug-taker. I've also had occasion to receive medication by
prescription. I wil admit that I took a lot of amphetamines. Speed that is. I liked it and took it frequently, so I can attest that it has some very attractive char-acteristics that anyone taking it could not help but like at the time.
It also has a gigantic letdown that is nearly intolerable. This
discomfort leads ANYONE to do something to alleviate it. It's probably
a matter of personal preference as to whether the discomfort of the
letdown outweighs the positive feeling of the high. If not, people
will keep taking speed.
Now for reasons, I also had a prescription for ritalin. You know
it's a controlled substance. The fact is it's an amphetamine
derivative and imparts nearly the exact same experience, though
not as sharp-edged. It has the high and the letdown. And people
undoubtedly make the same kinds of decisions as is the case with
They say that ritalin has a paradoxical effect on kids - meaning,
I suppose, that the reasons that make it a controlled substance
for adults doesn't apply to kids. Then they say in the same breath
that ritalin treats disorders in the ability to concentrate or to
pay attention, which are the exact things that speed and ritalin
accomplish in adults.
Both of these allow someone to focus exclusively on one task in
an enjoyable state of mind and body and accomplish it. Any
nervousness is just left over from the channeling of all the
generated energy into one task. What is created is not only the
false sense of security but the false ability to accomplish
things. As time goes on, one aspect of the letdown is the now-
understood knowledge that speed is generating false successes.
This is a depressing realization that can have detrimental
ramifications beyond anything to do with the drug.
In college, say, false successes on exams are acceptable and
desired because this is one occasion in which performance is
measured. But when someone's life consists of false successes,
false interactions, and false experiences - and the fact that
these are false is well-realized - the result can be a very
unhealthy individual self-conception whose validity is proved
and reproved constantly as amphetamine use continues.
I heard recently that now educators and other quacks find that
ritalin enhances performance for everyone (I just said that),
and they're thinking of prescribing it for that reason. This
kind of poisoning of the self-concepts being developed by kids
will create a generation of suicidal invalids. The idea is
This has gotten extremely long, and I wasn't planning on it.
But this ritalin thing is so insidious and is so OBVIOUSLY

What our biggest problem is, is that people want the
government to protect them from the oh so evil terrorists,
and they will willingingly have shackles put on them,
and rejoice when it is done.
I know people who WANT the government to take away their
rights for security, and its a lot of people, and its
far too many people.
Example:  "I don't care if the government has my keys
for encryption.  I don't do anything wrong, and if it
helps FBI enforce our just laws, I am all for it.  Since
anyone who tries to get keys without legal means will end
up in Leavenworth for the rest of their life, there is
no problems with people getting access to those things."
When I try to refute the logic:
"I don't care about the bill of rights... I don't want to
have to split my family up on separate flights so there is
a chance of some of them arriving without dying.  I want
the security of knowing I can fly okay without being
blown up, thank you very much.  Signapore has little or
no crime since the people give up their rights for a common
Problem with freedom is people don't use it... and like
a limb, will wither and fall off if not used.
Our basic item should be trying to get the masses to figure
out that freedom is important and should not be construed
as a gift from the government.

Tips for reporting this 'clandestine' list to the FBI (and it's contributors)
1) Be sure to speak slowly and use small words when contacting the FBI.
2) If you can, be sure to work the words 'Pipe Bomb', 'Olympics', and/or
'TWA' into your sentences.
3) Remember to unsubscribe from the list before reporting it.
4) Try not to be belligerant when the talking with the FBI -  RE: tracking
down cpunks; they're laughing at you, already.
5) Try not to use the word 'inbred' in your report..they seem particullarly
sensitive to this...for some reason.
6) When meeting FBI in person, do not wear shiny objects or bright colors -
it distracts them.
7) When calling the FBI hotline, don't ask to speak to someone about
munition smuggling AND computers crimez - this will put the operator into
8) Be sure to ask for special agent 'Fox Mulder' and 'Dana Sculley' -
they're 'the best'

Assoc. Press, 28-Jul-1996
Federal investigators reported "very good leads" Sunday in
the hunt for the Olympic bomber, and the Georgia National Guard mobilized fresh troops to add muscle to the force protecting against a repeat attack. Huge crowds, including more than 80,000 at the stadium, seemed undeterred by tougher security screening and fears of terrorism. "The more they check us, the happier I am," Nancy Hudgins, of Stone
Mountain, Ga., said at a handball game in the Georgia Congress Center. The Georgia state government said it would dispatch by Monday morning an additional National Guard infantry battalion, the 121st from Macon, to
supplement the civilian bag-searchers, metal-detector operators and guards at Atlanta Olympic sites. About 4,000 guardsmen are already deployed on any one day here. The
battalion would add "a few hundred" to that contingent, government spokesmen said. The civilian, police and military security army on hand here totals some
30,000. The White House said Sunday about 900 FBI agents are now assigned to Olympic duty. The Olympics turned into an armed encampment Saturday, police and soldiers and bomb-sniffing dogs everywhere, all athletes and fans

buildings from basements to rooftops. Officers conducted meticulous searches of vehicles, checking under them with extended mirrors the way a dentist probes for cavities. Security, already on high alert since the TWA Flight 800 explosion, became

A man from rural north Georgia says the FBI searched his home for clues to the weekend bombing at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park, a newspaper reported on Sunday.
The Daily Citizen-News of Dalton quoted 41-year-old Terry Roper of Rocky
Face, Georgia, as saying that investigators showed up at his remote country home on Saturday and searched the house, the yard and his vehicles with bomb-sniffing dogs.
The federal agents left after the search, telling the man they would be in
touch, the newspaper said.
"I was home here all night long. I haven't been to Atlanta in a year or
so," it quoted Roper as saying. He said he knows nothing about bomb-making.
The newspaper said police were acting on an anonymous tip phoned into its
circulation department by an unidentified caller.
Roper told the newspaper he believed the call stemmed from a workplace
conversation about precautions against terrorism at Olympic venues.
"I never have mentioned nothing about making a bomb, blowing anything up or anything like that. I don't know how to make a bomb," he was quoted as saying.

Short review of the Fedz show at DefCon.  Most of the San Francisco Computer Crime squad was in attendance.  SA Black and Butler's presentation was classic good cop/bad cop (respectively).  Nice quote by them in the Vegas paper about how all hackers aren't bad.  They were even doing recruiting, and had the little hacker puppies eatting out their hands for a mug, t-shirt, or minature badge. It wasn't determined whose surveillance goodies were being installed in the drop ceiling of the conference room at 4:30 AM.  The "hotel maintenance" guy certainly hauled ass when one of the official DefCon Goons showed up (classic textbook time for raids, black bag jobs, etc).  Tsk, tsk.  And me without any TSCM gear.
Points to the Fedz for great psy-ops (especially the quote about how the "new" FBI is more sensitive).  Points off to quite a few hackers who don't have a historical context of government abuse and are pretty damn easy to manipulate.
All in all, probably more entertaining than most shows on the Strip.
Obligatory comment on hackers compared to cypherpunks.  Zero to no  political savvy.  Extremely poor organizational and communication skills.  Nearly clueless on social issues.  These would be the hackers.  Yeah, yeah.  I know there are exceptions.  But all in all, I'd rather hang with C-punks.

The Prime Minister's Social Security Number
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's US Social Security Number is
172-42-6111, according to the Boston  Consulting Group in Massachusetts,
which employed Netanyahu for about one-year during 1979-80.=20
The number indicated by the marketing firm contradicts information contained
in a credit report by  the US federally-regulated Transunion Company, pulled
from company files during the first days of July.  According to that report,
Netanyahu and an American named   John J. Sullivan both used Social Security
number 020-36-4537.
Questions were raised in the reports as to whether  Netanyahu had attempted
to create a false identity or had used a number which was not his.
Publication of the credit report findings, and later  reports indicating
that Netanyahu's name had suddenly been deleted from Transunion's files,
raised additional questions about possible computer break-ins into the
company's records.
Netanyahu aides have repeatedly claimed that the prime minister does not
remember his number. In order to untangle Netanyahu from the issue, aides
three weeks ago,   asked US officials to provide his number. According to
the Prime Minister's Office, that request has yet to be answered.

  County Accuses Four of Using the Internet to Access Child Porn
  --------------------------------------------------------------
By Ronald K. Fitten
Seattle Times Staff Reporter
Four men, including two former Microsoft employees, have been charged
with allegedly using computers to access child pornography on the
Internet, said King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng.
"Traditional law-enforcement efforts against child pornography have
focused on magazines, movies, and tangible materials," Maleng said
yesterday.  "But law enforcement faces new challenges with the
emergence of new technology.  The Internet, with its millions of
international web sites, has become the new underground highway for
illegal child pornography."
The two former Microsoft engineers, Michael Seaman, 37, of Kirkland,
and Ronald Rosul Jr., 31, of Seattle, allegedly used Microsoft
computers to access and copy child pornography from the Internet,
according to prosecutors.
Microsoft said both were fired after Microsoft discovered the alleged
crimes in October 1995.
Seaman is charged with possession of child pornography.  He allegedly
used his Microsoft computer to collect more than 2,500 files of
photographs of young children in sexual poses or being sexually
Rosul is also charged with possession of child pornography.  He
allegedly used Microsoft equipment to manufacture a CD-ROM disk
containing child pornography.
Both Seaman and Rosul will be arraigned next week in King County
Superior Court.  If convicted, both could receive up to one year in
Maleng, who said police and prosecutors worked cooperatively with
Microsoft throughout the investigation, said law-enforcement officers
had confiscated computer hard drives, CD-ROMs, and printed materials
as evidence.
Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said the company found out about the
activities of its two former employees last year and alerted police.
"We provided the police with the computers to pull up the evidence,"
Murray said.
In an unrelated case, William D. Powell, 52, or Renton, and Dwight
Hunter, 48, of Bellevue, are charged with possession of and dealing in
child pornography.
Powell, an unemployed engineer, is accused of using his home computer
to exchange child pornography with Hunter.
If convicted of both offenses, Powell, who has a warrant out for his
arrest after failing to appear at his arraignment three weeks ago,
could be sentenced to between 21 and 27 months in prison.
Hunter, an unemployed salesman, is accused of using his home computer
to exchange child pornography with Powell and of having photographs in
his computer disks of children engaged in several types of sexual
activities with adults, other children, and a dog.
Hunter will be arraigned next week.  If convicted, he could receive
almost three years in prison.

You guys are confused.  The actual telephone call may cost only 2
cents/min, but the accounting and billing procedures are way more
expensive.  As long as they are doing any kind of usage-based
charging, that actual act of charging will continue to cost
considerably more than the data transmission.

@_author: "Pretty Good Privacy" 
@_subject: Real or Not ? 
I snagged this off a news group this AM.. comments??
A lot of people think that PGP encryption is unbreakable and that the
NSA/FBI/CIA/MJ12 cannot read their mail. This is wrong, and it can be a
deadly mistake. In Idaho, a left-wing activist by the name of Craig Steingold
was arrested  _one day_ before he and others where to stage a protest at
government buildings; the police had a copy of a message sent by Steingold
to another activist, a message which had been encrypted with PGP and sent
through E-mail.
 Since version 2.1, PGP ("Pretty Good Privacy") has been rigged to allow the NSA to easily break encoded messages. Early in 1992, the author, Paul Zimmerman, was arrested by Government agents. He was told that he would be set up for trafficking narcotics unless he complied. The Government agency's demands were simple: He was to put a virtually undetectable trapdoor, designed by the NSA, into all future releases of PGP, and to
tell no-one.
 After reading this, you may think of using an earlier version of PGP. However, any version found on an FTP site or bulletin board has been doctored. Only use copies acquired before 1992, and do NOT use a recent compiler to compile them. Virtually ALL popular compilers have been modified to insert the trapdoor (consisting of a few trivial changes) into any version of PGP prior to 2.1. Members of the boards of Novell, Microsoft, Borland, AT&T and other companies were persuaded into giving the order for
the modification (each ot these companies' boards contains at least one
Trilateral Commission member or Bilderberg Committee attendant).
 It took the agency more to modify GNU C, but eventually they did it.
The Free Software Foundation was threatened with "an IRS investigation",
in other words, with being forced out of business, unless they complied. The
result is that all versions of GCC on the FTP sites and all versions above 2.2.3, contain code to modify PGP and insert the trapdoor. Recompiling GCC
with itself will not help; the code is inserted by the compiler into
itself. Recompiling with another compiler may help, as long as the compiler
is older than from 1992.
