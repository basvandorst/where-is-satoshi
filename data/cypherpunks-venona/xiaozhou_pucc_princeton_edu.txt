1) Any publicity is good for us. These guys need controversy, and we've got it.
2) There's the 'international competitiveness' issue.
3) These guys hate Clinton to Schiminton.
4) Even if they pick the other side, we look good.
5) Larry King would of course be better, but is he returning your calls?
