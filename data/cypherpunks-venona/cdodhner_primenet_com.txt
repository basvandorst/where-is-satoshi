The NSA algorithm involved didn't use keywords. It was way more powerfull than that, able to sort text samples into arbitrary catagories based on examples of text that you give it. It doesn't use any keywords or grammer recognition, it doesn't even matter what language you feed it.
They refused to give me a copy, they are trying to make a buck by licensing it commercialy. I tried to ask about what it costs to get a license, and they asked what company I was representing, and I told them I was representing myself, and they stonewalled me. Looks like they don't think I have the money they want. (they're probably right about that btw...)

[good stuph left out here..]
For a long time I've wanted to set up a remailer that instead of just re-mailing the input mail would telnet to port 25 on a specified machine and spoof the headers exactly like you tell it to, or that would anon-ftp upload the "mail" message to a specified site, or that would continualy check a local (or remote) ftp directory for filenames that match a certain wildcard, processing them as inbound mail... I can think of a couple of situations under which having a mailer pick up off a newsgroup would be very usefull... send a pgp encrypted, nested message through a chain of four remailers... one is a standard-ish remailer which peels off the first layer of encryption and posts your message to a certain newsgroup. The second one, whos address remains a mystery, spoofs or remails the message it found in the newsgroup to a different newsgroup, where it is again picked up and decrypted by the third remailer, which uploads it to an ftp site watched by the fourth, again anonymous remailer, who picks it up and remails it to the recipient. It may all be an excercise in futility, I'm not an expert on that kinda thing, but it sure /seems/ more secure to me...

I personaly feel that anybody who bothers to go 'trashing' at my house already knows my name, S.I.N., address (obviously), phone number, and the status of my bank account. Anything more sensitive than the above does indeed get destroyed before disposal, and on days that I am feeling particularly paranoid, I add some 'interesting' fiction to my trash before I take it out...

Not to point out the obvious or anything, but 99% of the people on this list are inteligent enough to tell if a post is signed or not, and a spoofed sig can be one of two things: a) the actual sender trying to 'give a good impression' or 'see if anyone checks', or b) a third party trying for whatever reason to mislead people into thinking he/she is really somebody else that we know/trust. Situation 'a'? I don't give a damn, let them do what they want. Situation 'b'? Well the person they are spoofing is likely to yell loudly that they didn't write the post in question, and also there have been many times in the past where a signed message goes by and a few hours later several people have posted 'did anyone else get a bad sig check on XXXXX ?' messages... Why should we splater the list with 'flagged' messages so that the small percentage of us who don't (ever) check sigs will have some way of knowing that something was signed?  As my father used to say, "The lord helps those who help themselves. Let us go now and do likewise." This seems a little too much like a bit of net.welfare approaching. Added to that, it would be easy enough to hack toad, or somewhere just 'upstream' of toad, and edit out the 'bad sig' flags from selected messages, unless toad.com signed all outgoing messages after flagging them, which considering the list volume would slow that machine down to a crawl. All in all, I think it's too much trouble (for the list admins mostly, but also for those who wouldn't sign their posts but now feel compelled to do so) for a false sense of security.

It seems strange that people would be expected to trust a key to sign other keys, just because somebody (even Derek, whom I have a measure of respect for) asked them to. I trust a key to be an introducer if and when I am sure that a signature by that key means that the signed key belongs to the identity (be it "real" or a 'nym) it claims to represent. Authentication via Kerbie may or may not indicate this. Such a signature would give some information that I might use to make decisions on whether or not to trust the new key, but it certainly would not be trusted if it was the only signature.

I understand the difference and was not attempting to equate the two, just save a few words.. :)
That's the point I was trying to make, only you said it a little better.
*THAT* is the usefullness that I hadn't realized. Thanks for pointing it out.
