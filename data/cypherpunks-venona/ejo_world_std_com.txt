@_subject: Selling Pointers to Privacy 
WARNING: The following post, I realize, assumes that we all agree that we
should all have the right to buy and sell and take any chemicals we damn
well please. In Extropians, you don't have to mention this. In the world
at large, this elicits wide eyed stares, and sputtering noises of disbelief.
( I recall someone being willing to give up some privacy for 'less crack
in the schools.' Sorry. Not a good enough reason to give up one whit of
SELLING 'OFF THE SHELF' PRIVACY TO THOSE THAT WOULD PAY FOR IT...
(Providing Pointers, that is...)
I've been thinking about this PGP thing. Playing with it has been
a lot of fun, (The ultimate secret decoder ring!) and has made me
wonder, who *needs* this kind of security that doesn't have it
already? Who would pay for it? Who wouldn't care too much about
the legalities? Mid to large scale drug dealers, that's who!
I began to think of things I could do with off the shelf hardware
and software. Ease of use is important--I don't think many drug
dealers are going to want to mess around with command line
interfaces--So I started playing with the idea of a
voicemail/answering machine type thing, using macs with built in
microphones, modems, telecom software, etc. Maybe use hypercard to
create a single application with a phone book, so that they would
just double click on someone's name, and talk into the microphone.
Hit a button to end the message, and then hit, SEND. The hypercard
stack compresses and encrypts using PGP the voice file, which is
decompressed and encrypted automatically at the other end, maybe
producing a blinking button with that persons name on it, and the
time of the call. The interface design would be fun, actually.
Asynchronous, but perhaps useful enough? (With a 1.44 modem and
the 6/1 compression rate of my shareware voice recorder, it would
take about 2 minutes to modem a minutes worth of message--not too
bad, really.) I think it might be interesting to typeset a booklet
describing how to do this, and try to sell it in the back of
magazines--maybe Rolling Stones and High Times. The booklet might
just be pointers to the hardware and software needed, and the few
skills the client would have to acquire. You could sell the "ease
of use" hypercard stack through the booklet, too. You could wait
and see if the thing takes off before actually making the stack.
I've also thought, that you could sell phone support to people who
are trying to get this type of thing going. I'm less enthusiastic
about this; it seems like this would be a good way to get busted.
Of course, the legality of this hinges on the legality of PGP.
I've read some stuff about the copyright infringment aspect, and
have seen on Extropians, a legal action threatened against someone
who was advertising PGP in a big way.
Any thoughts? I'm halfway serious about this. Perhaps it could
exist in the same sort of quasilegal half-life as bongs,
psyloycybin spore logs, and automatic weapon conversion
kits--sure, it's illegal to use this stuff I'm selling, but I'm
not selling illegality...I'm just selling the stuff!
First Draft of Ad:
PHONE WITHOUT FEAR Did you know that personal computers can be
used to communicate with others with absolute privacy? That free
public domain software exists that cannot be cracked? Not even by
the CIA? For plans for a user friendly, voice-mail encryption

Maybe. If I don't chicken out. ;-)

Yeah, I heard that she had to do some gymnastics to explain how gay male
porn degrades women, too. ;-)
Is this true, or am I also a homophobe? ;-)
I hate Dworkins arguments. There are plenty of pro porn
lesbians/feminists. At least, I've read stuff by several, (bright/Annie
sprinkle, etc) and I've read some stuff by various porn stars that call
themselves feminists... Identifying feminism with censorship annoys me...I
wish I had some data on how many women who call themselves feminists are
pro censorship... if its the majority, I guess I'd have to allow it... ;-)
The problem for intellectuals is how to protect 'erotica' and somehow
squash 'pornography.' The difference is amusing to me. One mans erotica is
another womans porn...
All right thinking people would agree that the only thing that could be
wrong in the sex trade is coercion, be it of women or children or horses
or hamsters... I have some problem with the idea of the coerciveness of
the 'free market' though, as does Dworkin, so I guess we do have some
things in common... I'd like to know that no one is in the trade to pay
for a drug habit...of course, I think that drugs, like food and shelter
and air, should be free...
But I'm a nut. ;-)

I work at a graphic arts service bureau, and someone told me that they had
seen a canon representative, with a straight face, say at a trade show
that there was a chip in these machines that detected the pattern created
by currency, and blocked out the image. Easy to test. Of course, not true--at least, not the canon clc 300 I run.
The control panel of the canon has a list of things you are not supposed to
copy. That is the extent of the restriction. For some obscure reason I
follow these rules. I'm not sure why.
The chip thing made me laugh. What is amazing to me is that canon would
try to create this easily disprovable myth. Has anyone else heard this
story? My friend was adamant that he had heard this spiel (and not a
friend of his) but I suppose this could itself be an urban myth. I suppose I could call canon...but attracting that kind of attention to
myself seems really stupid...

It's true.  Canon did indeed create such a chip.  It's the same chip
that's used in vending machines to scan dollar bills.  They built a
prototype copier which prevented copying money, but I don't know if they
actually decided to install the chip in all their assembly-line
production copiers or not tho.

One could also imagine a 'symantic scrambler' analogous to the word analysis program, but designed to defeat it, by randomly altering the syntax of a post. The output might have to be tweaked afterwards, in order to restore some sense to it, but it would be a sort of ascii version of the cutting the words out of magazines style of ransom note.
It might just be a huge lookup table of canned phrases that get swapped in to replace your 'unique,' identifiable sentences. It seems like a dedicated global search and replace, combined with some sort of die throw to dictate sentence structure might be enough to screw up word analysis, Actually, the scrambler wouldn't have to be random--it could always produce output with the same word analysis signature. As long as a bunch of people were using it, or had access to it, you'd have deniability.

@_subject: Re: ID of anonymous posters via word analysis? 
I've seen a few programs which do this, but they were mostly for humor
value.  The program would pick out certain words or phrases and swap the
with other words of phrases in its database, mostly cliches and other
strange word usage.  (such as "Like, wow, gag me with a spoon" etc...)  The output was rather humorus, but most of the meaning was still
preserved.  I saw several of them used awhile ago during the Jon Fether
fiasco on the usenet (If any of you saw that - a little 14-year old got
daddy's modem and found a free internet site, and then started flamewars
on several usenet groups.  A few people took his flame posts and ran
then thru their "filters" and then re-posted them.)
Anyway, it probably wouldn't be too hard to just swap words with
synonyms or reorder or replace certain prepositional phrases.

The new models, the 350 and 550 do indeed have a currency recognition feature based on color. I was talking to a serviceman--interestingly, as with all crippling features, this one creates problems, as certain images become uncopiable if the color they use is upsetting the canon. The service man said that often the offending object may be copied simply by placing a sheet of acetate between the imaging area and the sheet to be I used to be skeptical of this feature--someone here conjected that it would be based on color. they were right. Smart.

THis dovetails with what the service guy told me about using some sort of piece of plastic to make stuff copy...but that was when we were working with the color theory--he said he could interpose this piece of clear material to make stuff that was the 'wrong color' copy. HE didn't say what it was.
