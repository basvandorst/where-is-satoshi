I found the whole thing boring and very tiresome.  People here need to grow
up.  Get a life.  While some start and perpetuate flame wars, and take great
delight in screwing with other people, the NSA/FBI/NIST is sitting back and
laughing their heads off.  Stop wasting your energy fighting each other and
concentrate on the REAL threat.

I thought this was rather tasteless.  MP is real.  My SO is MP.  It's not
very funny.  Do you know what causes MP?  Childhood sexual abuse.
Please think about it the next time you target a group for tasteless humor.

Err, actually, no.  She has memories of at least one other personality
from the age of 4.  Her memory is quite good...she has memories of sexual abuse
(I won't go into details) at age 3.  :( :(
