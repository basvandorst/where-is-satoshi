that back to Alice who also encrypted the ranno.)

Some of you may remember that I was promoting triple-DES-CBC using three
feedback loops rather than one, claiming that is was clearly at least as
secure as triple-DES with one feedback loop, while being faster for
pipelined operation.  It is clearly faster in a pipeline but Eli Biham has
shown me his attack on inner-loop triple-DES and it's quite good and I was
quite wrong...at least for chosen-ciphertext attacks.  The inner loops
weaken the resulting cipher drastically, under those attacks.
I might still use the inner loops to get longer brute force attacks (as
noted by Burt Kaliski in a posting here a while ago), if I knew that
chosen-ciphertext attacks couldn't happen, but my original claim is clearly
wrong and I thank Eli for pointing that out.  Meanwhile, there are probably
better ways to get the longer key for avoiding brute force (eg., XOR with a
single secret value or with a simple (fast) PRNG).
I'm told that Eli has a paper in preparation explaining his attack in full

publish their own RSA keys (big ones, presumably), and all the good little

include those keys as recipients when they encrypt messages.  If there are
to be multiple agencies which have to cooperate, the PGP or RIPEM software
would have to change to split the message key by XOR with ranno pieces,
but in the meantime, you could just include the FBI in your list of recipients

In fact, this has always been a possibility, unless you believe that all
hotel rooms, bus stations, city parks, farmer's fields, men's rooms,

meetings can be overheard).
Now, the next step for the NSA and FBI is to get on the stick and discover
ways to counter this threat.  Now that PCs permit criminal organizations to

telecommute cheaply, interaction among criminals for planning purposes will
be enhanced just as interaction among businesspeople and computer designers

That isn't hopeless.  However, it requires thinking in new ways and I don't

Maybe the result is that there is no security.  For example, we should not
expect to achieve more protection from plans laid during electronic

..and, no, I don't believe there should be a law prohibiting private
physical meetings.  There will *always* be some insecurity.  There is
always a nut with a gun out there.  There are also car accidents.  I am not
totally safe and would not want to live in a world in which the police are
powerful enough to make it that safe.
What I kept suggesting to Dorothy Denning, as this flap was building, was
1. the gov't should immediately drop the Clipper proposal because it's
alienating people who need to be on the gov't's side;
2. the gov't should actively promote encryption of cellular calls with
an untappable algorithm, for the over the air link (with conversion back
to clear voice once it hits the cellular office) -- providing the public
with trustworthy security, addressing the public's biggest security threat
and therefore reducing the market demand for encryption which interferes with
wiretaps; and
3. the LE and intelligence community should recognize that the world has
changed beyond the point of no return, thanks to the PC and to
communications technology, and there is no way to prevent criminals from
using totally secure cryptography to aid in their plans.  Criminals have
always had access to strong cryptography for their communications (cf.,
Kahn talking about the rum runners, for example (Elizabeth Friedman's
efforts as a cryptanalyst)) and the world hasn't fallen apart yet.
However, the PC and high speed digital communications mark a slight change
in the landscape and these changes need to fuel some good, creative,
technical work -- not a bureaucratic running-scared retreat to an impotent
"there oughtta be a law".
I don't know if it's too late, thanks to the FBI and NSA serious alienation
of people (like us) who matter.  It might be.  Once they declared war on
us, it's unlikely to expect us to suddenly look at them as good guys.
However, if they followed my 3 step plan right now, they'd have a chance
still -- at least, I believe they would.

That seeds a PRNG (currently subtract-with-borrow, but it could be made

@_subject: let's help law enforcement 
How come people in law enforcement are calling for us crypto junkies to
help them by giving up crypto (especially when that's useless, since
criminals don't need us for their crypto) ?
I've heard DERD and Co. ask us (me) to come up with a compromise stand.
Well -- here's mine:
NSA can do cryptology in secret and we won't try to pry it out of them.
We'll do cryptology in public and publish it, give away code, etc.
We'll be good citizens and join the local Neighborhood Watch, etc., calling
the police to report lawbreaking which we witness.
What more could possibly be expected of us?  What better way is there to
support law enforcement?

@_subject: "If you're against unreadable encryption, don't use it!" 
It's probably time for us to remind the security services (over and over)
that they're within their rights to pass rules like "if you have access to
classified information, then you're required to include the info's owning
agency as a recipient in every encrypted message you send (since PGP and
RIPEM both allow multiple recipients and there's nothing to stop the Dept
of Energy, the CIA, the NSA, etc., from generating PGP and RIPEM keys to be
used for this purpose.)
This might have a chilling effect on whistleblowers, but it should keep
those agencies from claiming that PGP and RIPEM are a security threat via

ich habe das auch gesehen.  Aber, manchmal kommen die urspruengliche Mails
*nach* den Replien (sp? :-).  Vielleicht ist das immer das Problem.

@_subject: Re: the rest of the key 
..but what of at least the original description which had the key generated
by a function within the sacrificial laptop (a PRNG driven by the two
key pieces supplied by the escrow agents)?
K_i = PRNG( E_1, E_2, i ) ;
If PRNG is secret (a high power NSA algorithm), it might be a *truly* high
quality one-way-function -- which happens to be independent of E_1 and E_2.
No one would be the wiser -- and the NSA's job would be a lot easier, in
the event that some chips get stolen or someone bombs the escrow center
and its backup sites.

@_subject: remailers for kids 
In article  you write:
Funny you should ask this.
I had a conversation just yesterday with a relatively new parent who is
really scared about the Internet because it leaves kids exposed to wierdos.
Rather than ask for elimination of anonymity for weirdos, he was asking for
anonymity for the kids -- not just the e-mail address hiding of various
remailers but also an automatic filter on postings to remove (or translate)
names, addresses and phone numbers.
I know of no one who has done anything beyond hiding e-mail addresses but
that software exists, at least.  (I've cc:'ed them here.)
Perhaps some will have thoughts on the rest of the problem.

I wonder whether exchange of encrypted e-mail with a foreign national

was a foreign agent....

Still -- good article.  Thanks.

P.S. We need to establish that publishing an article on an FTP server or
via an e-mail newsletter is, in fact, publication according to the first
amendment.  This may be the wrong case to establish that precedent but it
needs to be established.

@_subject: PGP 2.5 working on UNIX 
Note -- I built it for my UNIX machine but I needed to edit the rsaref2
makefile in 3 places to specify gcc.  cc barfed on the make.
The instructions say to make your own directory, but you need to edit
the makefile and run make in place in the rsaref2/install/unix directory
or the pgp makefile won't find it.
You should make rsaref2 first.

P.S.  I'll sign my new 1024 bit key with my old 1264 bit key later.

@_subject: Gelernter's piece 
I wish I could stop each person advocating Clipper and get them to explain
how this will give access to criminals' conversations before they
Even DERD backed way down from there on Science Friday last week -- saying
that Clipper *wasn't* for giving access to criminal conversations -- just
for making sure that the gov't standard didn't shoot the gov't in the foot.
Given that more reasonable stance, the next step is to eradicate from the
record (before the jury sees it) any mention of criminal behavior or
wiretaps of criminals as a justification for Clipper.
From that point, I think we could have a reasonable debate.

When we engage in debates with the forces of the Dark Side, we should be
careful not to let them talk about criminals as a single class.  It bothers
me to see people on that side do bait-and-switch: talk about the evils of
major Coke importers to get people worked up then admit that the big ones
won't be affected by Clipper but 'some criminals will be'.
