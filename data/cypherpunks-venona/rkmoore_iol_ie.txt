@_subject: white noise remailer 
I'm new to all this so please pardon my ignorance, but are you guys
consdidering the following approach:
The remailer transmits a constant bandwidth of outgoing messages of all
about the same size to a uniformly distributed range of target addresses.
Incoming messages are randomly dispersed within this stream, packed out to
the standard size.

Not that difficult for an intelligence agency.
Can be tapped.
rate, the probability of anyone or any organization having the
capacity to monitor and process ALL of Internet traffic should be
very small and decreasing.
That's what super-computers are for (besides chaos modelling).

@_subject: "bad" government 
the right of the individual to make choices for themselves.
Quite untrue. It's society which provides you with an environment in which
you have choices. And its government which orders that society. It's
because government has served you so well, that you have luxury to
fantasize you don't need it. You're being duped.
do with the empowerment of the individual.  Some seem to not recognize that.
The "Third Wave" -- if you take the PFF's Magna Carta definition (and
Toffler is one of the authors) -- is a power grab by corporations to return
the world economy to status of the USA economy in the 1880's. You so-called
libertarians might like the theoretical, abstract formula of "unregulated
capital", but if you'd put down your Friedman long enough to read history,
you'd know that it was a disaster. Unregulated capitalism is incompatible
with a civilized societiy.
disinformation, have always attempted to keep true power from the hands of
the people.
So why are you on the wrong side?
PS> If this list would like to see the full Magna Carta, or my
analysis/review of it ("Electric Dreams" sent you a few clips), please let
me know.

@_subject: the moderation principle 
From: alt (Al Thompson)
    If strong government resulted in liberty and freedom, then the
    most intrusive, all-encompassing governments would result in
    its citizens having the most liberty.  Is this the case?  I would
    look at the (former) Soviet Union, Iran, Cuba, East Germany, etc.,
    for your answer.
In all things, moderation. If I like salt on my steak, that does not mean
the most salt is the best.
Thinking in fundmentalist extremes severely limits your room for creative
problem solving.
You don't do that when you discuss cypers -- you don't take rigid sides of
"subway" vs "mixmaster", and paint the other side as fools becauase their
system would be silly if taken to its extremes. You learn from one another.
Be as creative about political possibilities.

@_subject: Re: ITAR double standards? 
So true.  When I worked in Silicon Valley firms, I noticed how
International Air Courier services were used entirely like
Interdepartmental Mail, with no concern for export laws or import duties,
etc.  If we travelled overseas, _of course_ we took our laptop with all
it's software (including encryption), and _of course_ we'd leave software
copies on colleagues hard disks, after doing demos and such.  All with a
sense of total righteousness -- we were tax-paying wage-earners just doing
our job.
        There's a real irony here, if you think about the Barlow-expressed
sentiment that cyberspace is a new free domain, having achieved escape
velocity from terrestial anachronisms.  While Barlow's critics, it seems,
demolished _that_ thesis as wishful thinking, there's a parallel thesis
that may actually be true: that _corporate environments_ have achieved
escape velocity from civil jurisdiction, and now live in a world where
rules & ethics are relative only to corporate culture, and "parochial"
national laws are to be quietly ignored, knowing there's a highly-paid
legal staff to deal with occasional embarrasments.
        We dream and they implement.

That's what I assumed in the first place.  Thanks, Peter, for doing
the math.  Do you have a solution as satellites cross the horizon, or for
very-distant spoofing?  ...co-conspirator nodes tightly-coupled via laser
or wire?

@_subject: Re: Protocols at the Point of a Gun 
IMHO, the technical problems can somehow be solved, whether we like
it or not, although it will probably be botched intentionally or otherwise.
It's tougher than most protocol upgrades, but easier than was designing
X.400 (just to give some GROSS bounds to the problem).
        My (simplistically presented) suggestion in such a scheme would be
that we don't want a "flag" on packets: we want two "fields":
        - content-classification field in packets:
                _roughly_ analogous to a dewey-decimal number -- says a lot (?)
                about the content, not merely which end of the library it
                goes in
        - user-classification field appended to user-id's:
                a micro-bio of the user -- says something
                about age, languages known, interests
        Before you flame -- I'm not thinking about the potential abuses,
I'm thinking about the useful applications: more useful filtering based on
such fields can be installed as agents on:
        - user machine
        - "dial-in" network node
        - retrieval engines
        - database engines

Ha ha!  The U.S. and Panama probably exceed all of the above in

"in the family".
