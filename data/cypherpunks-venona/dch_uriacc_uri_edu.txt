@_subject: LACC: PC Phones Home? 
I came across a blurb in the local paper today and was interested if
someone here could provide some substance to the story:
"Software to the rescue:
If somoeone steals your PC, you may be able to get it back because of
software that acts as a kind of tracking device. Home Office Computing
magazine reports that the software CompuTrace TRS will automatically dial
the office of its creator, Absolute Software, if a thief hooks up a stolen
PC's modem to a phone line. The software reveals the location of the PC and
Absolute Software will call the police" - Providence Journal-Bulletin -
March 12, 1996.
Any Comments?
