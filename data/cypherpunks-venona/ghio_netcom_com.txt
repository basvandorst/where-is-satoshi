Man, this place is like a bunch of guerilla fighters preparing for war.
People are really on edge.  Make one wrong move and everybody starts
shooting.  I'm afraid that sooner or later it could be real bullets too.
BTW, Netcom splits its newsfeed between two servers.  Currently the
netcom.*, comp.*, and rec.* are all on one, and everything else is on the
other, although they move them around every few months.  Occasionally one
or the other server starts acting up, causing the respective heirarchies
to be temporarily inaccessable.

One way to speed up RSA is to compute the series m^2, m^4, m^8, m^16...
on one processor and then multiply together the values for each one bit
in the decryption exponent on the other processor.  It's only about a 33%
speedup tho.  The other possibility is to compute the two 'halves' on
seperate processors when doing decryption.  I don't know of any way to
parallelize it to more than two processors for encrypting or more than
four for decrypting.
Discrete log systems are a bit more interesting in this respect - you can
precompute the series g^2, g^4, g^8...  (I think cryptolib does this)
then the initial parameter in a Diffie-Hellman exchange is simply the product of some elements of that series.  The multiplications can be
carried out in parallel in a hierarchial fashion which can be completed
in O(log(log(m))) time, where m is the modulus (assuming you have enough
processors).  However, for the second half of the exchange, you can't
precompute anything so you are stuck with the same problem as with RSA.

I tried this site using Mosaic 2.7b2 and was told:
     Your computer is a X11;Linux 1.2.13 i486.      Your Internet browser is NCSA Mosaic.      You just visited the Anonymizer Home Page. With Arena it gave me:
     Your Internet browser is Arena/0.96s libwww/.
Lynx came up with even less:
     Your computer is a Unix box.
     Your Internet browser is Lynx.
I did manage to completely confuse it with:
This time it actually took a stab at the user name, and got it completely
wrong, although the hostname (netcom20.netcom.com) was correct.  I suspect
it used finger and took a wild guess.
The rest of the information is obvious from the User-Agent header, though I
find it unusual that the new Mosaic reports the cpu/os type:
 User-Agent:  NCSA_Mosaic/2.7b2 (X11;Linux 1.2.13 i486)  libwww/2.12 modified
Mosaic 2.4 reports only:
 User-Agent:  NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System/2.4 (L10N-2.4.0)  libwww/2.12 modified
Lynx reports:
 User-Agent:  Lynx/2.2  libwww/2.14
The statement "Your computer is a Unix box." seems to be just a likely
guess, but it could be wrong, because there is a version of lynx for MSDOS.
What suprises me is not the information this got, but what it *DIDN'T* get.
It never managed to figure out my username, despite the fact that netcom
runs identd, and all three web browsers give it my username when they opened
the FTP connection.  It only reported the hostname in one instance, and
seems to be ignoring the info from the ftp session.
This "snoop" script isn't getting half the information it could!

Maybe the courts will rule that if people put an X-rated header flag on
their web pages then it's legal because concerned parents can have SurfWatch
block it.  The result of that would probably be that a large percentage of
sites would mark their content X-rated just so they are off the hook
legally, whether or not they really have anything pornographic.  But I can
live with that.

alt.binaries.warez.crypto has existed for a long time (at least on Netcom),
although I haven't seen any posts lately.  I suspect many sites deliberately
exclude alt.binaries.warez.* to save disk space.

anon.penet.fi actually used a 486/66 running FreeBSD.
: ! I suggest the following configuration: a IBM 486 PC with 16MB of
: ! RAM and 28.8 modem, running qmail instead of sendmail and Linux,
: How is qmail better than sendmail?  The default BSD sendmail since 8.00+
: has automated ident requests built in.  It can easily be compiled without
: that default option, for greater efficiency.
Disable reverse-DNS too...
: ! on a dedicated 28.8 PPP line. The cheapest used VGA display from
: ! the nearby waste dump will work just fine.
: Hell, any monitor should work!
You don't need a monitor at all.  Since we're assuming that the remailer
is a dedicated machine, and you'll do your real work on another computer,
just plug a null modem cable into the serial ports and use a terminal
program on your other computer.
: ! Estimated cost: $700-1000 for the system, $50-100/month for the
: ! connection, and 3 hours per day to deal with mailbombing from
$500 tops.  8MB is probably okay, 16 might improve resistance to mailbombs
a bit tho.  You can get 486 motherboards for under $100 nowadays.
Do the math: used 486 MB+CPU: $100
                    16MB RAM: $150
            case+powersupply: $50
                    100MB HD: $20
               HD Controller: $15
      Dual 16550 Serial Card: $15
              28800bps Modem: $150
                             ------
                              $500
And if you really want to run a remailer, I can sell you most of the above,
and I'll even throw in a 340MB IDE HD with Linux+remailers preinstalled!
(Yes, I'm serious.)

Yes, yes, and no... Arbitrary government decisions are not unconstitutional
in general; however, arbitrary discretion in prohibiting publications is
most certainly a voilation of the First Amendment.
They get you through their paradigm of standardless discretion.
