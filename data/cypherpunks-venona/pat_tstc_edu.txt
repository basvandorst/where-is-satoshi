I thought about this yesterday at lunch, at about the time the fire
started in the Davidian compound.  Only as it applies to the overthrow
of a government or such.
Agree on the initial frequency and time, then send the next frequency
and time encoded in the message text to avoid jamming.

Of all the lists I'm subscribed to, this is the only one that I read
*every* article in.  Even the "noise" articles.  Humans being what
they are, the noise is needed to help decide the direction of the
group.  Besides, for those of us who are just starting on our journey
through crypto-underworld need the noise to help familiarize
ourselves with how crypto works.  I've learned more from the informal
ramblings than I've gathered out of all the formal and/or mathematical
postings to date.
I don't mind tech... but let's not do away with the noise either.
One persons opinion.

Why not have the device driver create a file (possibly of varying sizes) on the hard drive which the encryption device driver then makes look like another
drive?!?  This is how the compression programs work, seems to me a pretty
viable way to solve the encrypted drive problem as well.  A good place to start
on this would be something like DOS's VDISK device driver, it maps a portion
of RAM into a RAM-disk... a good way to understand how a DOS device driver should map something that has no disk-like characteristics into disk-like

Actually, no it wouldn't.  A yagi antenna at 800 Mhz is not very large
at all.  A 16 element at that frequency would probably be less than 5
feet long.  Beans for a satellite to carry into orbit today.  Of
course the problem then is the beam will provide a fairly wide "spot"
on the surface of the Earth that will still cover several cell sites.
Although come to think of it, narrowed to area to adjacent sites
you'll not have to contend with hearing two sites on the same
frequency due to coordination.

Could someone please define a 'data haven'?  I understand digitial cash, it is exactly what it sounds like.  However, in the context I've heard
data haven used in, then there is much more than simply keeping one's data encrypted on your local hard drive.
Still learning and trying to understand all of these things.

@_subject: Re: Tax Evasion and SASE. 
I was thinking about this just yesterday...
However, rather than rewrite an entire mailer system from scratch, might I propose that we ad an extra command to the cypherpunks remailers that
would allow a person to tell the remailer NOT to throw away the the header information.
This would allow a person to create an encrypted block to put at the top of their message telling the remailer to pass all header
information through to the recipient.
Remailer-Command: Header-Intact
Request-Remailing-To: pat
The user encrypts this whole block and tells the remote user to put this at the header of thier reply message.
== place at the top of your message text and remove this line ==
Encrypted: PGP
== place message text below this line and remove this line ==
In effect, a self-addressed envelope.  Half of the functionality
is available in the remailers currently.

@_subject: Re: Super Phones? 
Essentially this is correct, but as Phil Karn already pointed out... spread
spectrum is easy to de-spread.
However, Motorola has a cordless phone called the Secure Clear phone that
operates at 46 to 50 MHz (standard cordless phone freqs.) that has "encryption" between the handset and the base.
After calling motorola I am not impressed... they use frequency inversion.
Their support person stated that the goal is to "stop casual eavesdroppers that might use baby-monitors or police scanners."  Which is fine and good.
I know, from personal experience, the problems that can arise from cordless
telephones being monitored and the information used against a person.
The Motorola and Cincinatti Microwave phones can help with the casual listeners
that are out there (and there are quite a few of them!), but neither will
stop an interested party with resources to spare.  :)

I'm looking to find out about the ITAR regulations on export of crypto to
the West Indies.  A company that I do consulting for sends out demos that
contain some database crypto stuff and they are concerned now that they have
a request from outside the United States.  Any pointers to where I can find information on this would be extremely helpful.  Thanks.

@_subject: Re: pseudospoofing ad nauseam 
Actually, I still do not think he knows the answer.
However, the second part of the question is more relevant.  No, the
bank, my associates, or the government does not have the right to know
who I am simply because I exist and do business with them.  Those
entities should only know what I tell them, nothing more.  The current
trend towards Big Brotherism in the *real* world is why I'm a
cypherpunk.  I wish to control my own information, not some faceless
bank, credit beaurau, or other possibly wrong information provider.

@_subject: HUMOR:  Timothy C. May is the CONSPIRACY! 
In the grand style of the infamous L. Detweiler, here is proof that Timothy
C. May is the real culprit behind all this.
Tim's penchant for creating boiling cauldrons has "caught" him in this case.
He states that he keeps all the messages for archival purposes to create a book at a later time.  Notice that another Cypherpunk subscriber from the same site points out that LD is merely baiting the Cypherpunks and the world into situations for book material.  Tim obviously urged Harry into sending
the second message above.
This is the final proof.  I do not believe that Tim actually creates the text that apparently comes from LD.  It is Tim's cat!  This is why
the link between LD and Tim has not come to light sooner.  Tim has conspired with his cat to create this "uproar" for material for his
upcoming book.  Since Tim and his cat are two seperate entities their
message text does not correlate, however the inclusion of a piece of "Detweiler Text" inside of one of Tim's messages proves beyond a shadow of
a doubt that Tim must somehow be responsible for LD's posts.
I submit to you that it is Timothy C. May is actually L. Detweiler and
he has fooled us all!  I just hope it makes a good book!

@_subject: Re: EFF Op-Ed from the NY Tim 
This is beginning to kill me!  This guy comes from the cmu.edu domain
and obviously has never tried to get an account on a system outside of
his institution.  Much less on one of the "expensive on-line
services", as he put it.
Here's some news!  Currently the Delphi service offers full Internet
connectivity (e-mail, FTP, Telnet, Gopher, News) for $20 a month for
20 hours of access.  Delphi can be accessed through SprintNet which
means that most metropolitan areas will have a local dial in point.
In the near future America On Line has stated that in the near future
they too will go full connectivity, they charge $9.95 a month for 4
hours worth of access.  AOL currently has e-mail available.  That's
just two of the services that can be accessed from just about any city
of any real size in the states.
Now, let's talk about those sysops that want to get connected to the
Interet.  Here in Waco, Texas (a city of about 150,000 people...
250,000 people if you count all the outlying cities) to get a 56K
dedicated Internet connection would cost something like...
    	$  600.00	Local Loop Termination/Installation
These figures are ballpark, and some are gueses based on experience in
dealing with the regional networks here in Texas.  I know several
sysops here that would easily spend $5000.00 on their board in one
shot, and could easily spend the $300.00 a month for the connection.
On top of all that, it is a proven fact that people will *pay* for
Internet connectivity.
These costs are based on a dedicated 56K connection.  A 14.4 or 19.2K
SLIP connection would probably be *much* less!
And, as Duncan and so many others are so fond of pointing out.  If the
gummint would get out of the way and let competition happen for the
local loop these prices would drop dramatically.

@_subject: Re: Crypto not being used where needed 
Technically it is that easy.  Cellular phones only "hop frequencies"
when they are mobile.  In other words as I am driving along the
highway my phone is changing frequencies as I change cells.  If I am
stationary, however, my phone will most likely stay on one frequency
within that cell.  However, the MTSO (Mobile Telephone Switching
Office) may command my phone to change to a different frequency if
another user moves into my cell and the MTSO "decides" that my current
frequency would be better allocated to the other user.
In any case, there are two solutions to tracking the frequency of a
particular cellular user.  First, and most expensive.  Get the users
ESN (Electronic Serial Number) from the phone and listen in on the
control channel.  I do not know how the control data is modulated on
the control frequency, but once you can decode that data you can "see"
the MTSO command the phone to change frequencies and cells.  Secondly,
simply get a frequency counter and a yagi antenna.  By pointing the
antenna at the cellular antenna you should be able to get the
frequency the phone is currently on.  When the phone switches
frequencies, simply follow the same procedure.  Labor intensive, but
cheap!  Note, these are general ideas based on what I know about
cellular.  I am most definetely *not* an expert on cellular technology.
I would be willing to bet that it would be "fairly" easy for the
average techie to be able to intercept and decode your PD's data.  And
only a "little" more difficult to spoof one of the mobile data
terminals.  If they are using off-the-shelf hardware then you can
assume that you could buy the same hardware!
