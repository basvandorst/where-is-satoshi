@_subject: Crypto Games 
I'd like to float a few ideas on this, generated by cutting right back
to fundamental objectives.

our objective is to raise awareness of crypto -- not only for the
obvious purposes of sending secret messages, but as a basic, useful,
and necessary tool for many other applications. Ideally, it should be
a game which simply cannot be reasonably played without the use of
crypto, a point Tim was driving towards earlier. Additionally, the
actual use of encrypted messages must be visible to all parties (and
outsiders) as Kent pointed out in his original posting.
Without intending to rain on anyone's parade, I think that the choice
of a card game is probably not the best vehicle, for a number of
reasons. Firstly, most card games are too close to realtime. While
that is no great problem technically given internet-connected
machines, it severely reduces the visibility of the underlying crypto

An off-topic aside: this is already done. Check out the NetBSD and
Linux projects sometime. NetBSD is about to release 1.0, the first
fully-working unencumbered release of bsd 4.4 for several
platforms. Linux is well known by now. I have both, they are far
superior for my needs than any MS product.

Choose whatever picture you like... the *real* symbol is encrypted and
stego'd into it :)
