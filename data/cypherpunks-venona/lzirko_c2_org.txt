Now if we could get John to get it to work with the 32-bit version it would be even better.

Pronto Secure, currently in beta 6.16, is shaping up as a fine all-inclusive mail package that supports PGP.  You might want to take a look at it at:
Beta Testers residing in the USA are invited to download the beta from:
        Non US residents should download from:
        I have been with it since beta 1 and it definately has come a long way.  Platforms supported are the MS GUI.  It is a 16-bit app.  I currently run it under NT 3.51 w/ 32-bit PGP executables.
Take a look.

They have started mentioning the product on their web pages and provide a link to the beta site for sign-ups etc.  Since 6.x I have not yet experienced a product crash, except with a disk full condition which was reported to them earlier today.  BTW, would you be interested in setting up a secure channel for testing?

The policy implemented about 10 months ago was for a $100 fee to register new domain names.  This was good for two years.  Current domain holders were to be billed $50 each year to maintain their domain names.  The billings for the current domain name holders are now just beginning to be Lou Zirko                                (502)383-2175

You could have all 1000 sync with the same time server.  There are plenty of standard time servers available on the net and timer daemons are available for most platforms.

Following is an article from PC Week that some might find of interest.  Also available at this URL -         Secure Computing Corp. has signed a $15 million deal with the
        National Security Agency to develop the agency's secure
        network server system for Department of Defense employees'
        E-mail.
        Officials of the St. Paul, Minn., company announced that
        Secure Computing will take about a year to complete the
        project, which will ensure security within the Defense
        Department E-mail system.
        The agreement is an extension of a deal Secure Computing first
        signed with the National Security Agency in 1992, according to
        company officials.

Thanks for the info.  Downloading now and it appears to be going more smoothly than the time I got beta 6.  No delays and good throughput.  And I have yet to talk with someone that has successfully downloaded the `other guys` 128-bit version.  I sure have not been able to!
