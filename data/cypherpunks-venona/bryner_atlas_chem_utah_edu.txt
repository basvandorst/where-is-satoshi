There are two curves you have to worry about, one is computation, the other is advances in mathmatics.  Even if some great advance was made in factoring, a larger key *might* remain safe.  This is the reason, not increased computational power.  That is, unless you have proven some verry interesting things about factoring numbers and algorithmic complexity.

I would say this can be extended and made a general rule.  You should always take some reasonable ammount of time(say 5 min) to encrypt your most sensitive messages, even if you have a 12 crays and a connection machene.  The algorithim can be viewed as giving you an economic advantage, and worying over spending $.01 vs $.0001 is not just stingy, it is dangerous.

Lets say you pick these from a set of books.
All this does is give you a larger dictionary, with say 10^6 vs 10^3 entries.
It could be even longer if you use fragments of sentences.
This means you will need half the number of sentences you needed words for.
Some one might be clued in by the fact that your books show considerable use at certain pages.
The mixing up stuff adds bits, but not that many, perhaps 10 if you really do a good job.
so I would say you have 10^5(4 digit number) *(10^6)^2(two sentences) *10^3(choosing the nth letter, or stagering) or about 10^20.
Seems ok to me, about 60 bits.
If I bust you and look at your books, though, you could be screwed.
This is not much of a concern in a reasonably free country, but....
Also, if you don't have your books, you can't get into your computer.

@_subject: MD5 is 1=>1? 
I have had this question also, has it been shown that the transformation of 128bit words through md5 is *theoretically* invertable, as if it is not, iterating it 1024 times could actually make you *LOOSE* entropy.
(say it was a random transformation, it would not contain each of the 128 bit outputs, ie some inputs would map to the same output.)
I am not aware of any such result.

The ALGORITHIM also contains information.  If the ALGORITHIM is part of a secret key, so much the better.  To say exactly how much information an algorithim contains is, to say the least, formatable.  In the case of functions, it is simple.
Lets put the question to addition, how much entropy does + have when applied to bits.?

@_subject: Re: MD5 is 1=>1? 
No.  Again, the only way that MD5 can keep the entropy of a string is for every single 128 bit string to map itself onto a unique 128 bit string, for if two 128 bit strings produce the same output, then you loose entropy.
The question is, when md5 is restricted to 128 bit values, does it loose entropy, and if so how much?  As much as a random mapping?  if so, the 1024 bit itteration in secure drive HARMS security.

This is incorrect, with a large memory, this is the birthday paradox in action, and it takes about 2^64 tries, which puts SHS right up there at 2^80 same as skipjack.
Even with less memory, you can still improve on this though not as much.

@_subject: Re: Password entropy 
This is not correct.  You still have the same problem that you don't know if the transformation is 1=>1.  You have added a lot of "psudo-random" stuff but unless you keep this in your head, it is laying around for your oppenent to grab(assuming non-secrecy of the algorithim).
Assuming a random function for MD5, it is simple to calculate the loss of entropy by calculating the number of collisions on adverage(intigrate the probilility of n collisions) and assumeing indipendence between rounds.  I might point out that a better "buisy work" function would be to use to output of a RNG as a key for multiple idea incryptions, or some such scheme as this, as you are guarenteed of not loosing any entropy if you can (theoretically) decrypt the result.
The problem with such a "buisy work" function is that it sould be hard to simplify, ie xoring with the sequence 1010101010101010101010101... is easy to calculate dirrectly, without going through all the steps.  This, I would guess, gets into a whole other ball of wax.

@_subject: Re: MD5 is 1=>1? 
Hmm, I read this as reverting is imossible, as it genrealy is when you start with 1MB and hash it to 128 bits(or compression would be neat!), then that finding two messages that hash to the same value is as difficult as brute force, which is not really true, if taken literally.
Perhaps my original question about cycles and entropy loss is beter in the context of a broken system such as MD4.  Are there 128 bit messages in MD4 which hash to the same value, and if so, what insight into the cycle leingth vs string leingth would it give us.
lets say each dot is a 128 bit number, a string could feed a cycle, such as shown below.  When this occurs, you loose entropy, as it ceases to be sequentially dependent on a 128 bit number, and instead a subset of the cycle.
                  .   .
                  .....
Here is an example hash function, for two 64 bit words, a, b;
now hash^2(a,b)=2a,2b.
so here you have lost 1 bit of information when  you start to itterate the hash function, and will be left with exactly 1  option after 128 iterations of this function in every case.
This is why I won't use securedrive with the 1024 option, as I view it as a SERIOUS NEGITIVE THREAT TO SECURITY OF THE SYSTEM.  Changeing this to encrypting 1024 times with idea and a key generated by a PRNG has no such security hole possible, and is what I would view as a proper "buisy work function[TM]" althought nothing has been said about its ireducibility.
I would recomend replacing that option or discarding it, that is unless hash functions never throw away bits in sizes smaller than their output size.
(again, that was my question)

This refers to the secure drive 1024 iterations of MD5.  Without a proof that md5(128bit number) is a one to one transformation, my statement about looseing entropy is possibly.  I don't think that it has been demonstrated that md5^1024 is more secure than md5.
NOBODY HAS IMPLIED THAT SUCH A PROOF, or equivilent proof, exists.

Gee, thanks for leting me play, do I get a consolation prize?:-)
Let me think, I still don't see any proof that this does not loose entropy, and it could, as if the two parts are not independent of each other.
As soon as you start making a feedback machene, you have no guarentee that this is a maximal unless there is no state that is imediatly preceeded by two other states.
Simply throwing a lot of stuff at a password is no substitute for a proof that the transformation does not loose entropy, which is available if you use an encryption algorithim for the last 1023 transformations, and a hash function only for the first one.
Sorry to be a pain.

You can prove that there is no such interaction if you use two different algorithims on two halfs of a one time pad message, even with the SAME key.

How about a different tack, having all branch instructions feed in some number from the program, generated from the state of the program, to a lookup hard-key.  The program then branches to the appropriate site.
If the number of branches/states of program  was great enough, this might be secure(of cource, they can just watch it and recode, but they could probably re-write the code for this ammount.)
