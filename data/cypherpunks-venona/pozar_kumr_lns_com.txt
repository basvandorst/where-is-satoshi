Thanks for your input.  If anyone else wants to feed back to the
program, they can send me email and I will pass it along to the producers.
I am also the technical consultant to the show, so your mail will not be
falling on deft ears...

Geez... What happened to the idea of using a reversed-biased diode?
That into a cheapy A/D and into a UART, should do the trick...

@_subject: Re: So you want a wide-spectrum signal analyzer ? 
We use them all the time to track down pirate stations and wierd
emissions (spurs, harmonics...).  BTW... If you have an O-Scope that has
X-Y inputs, it isn't that difficult to design and build a low-end, front-end for the scope that will provide the same functions as a spectrum analyzer.
   I think they partially do this 'cause the catalogs are so bloody
expensive to produce.  They are an education if you get one.

I should add, it needs to be formated properly or it will not be read
into the record and just tossed.   Some where around here I have an
example folks can use.  I will dig it up and post it in a day or so.

I just got a call back from Dave Wilson of the FCC and told me that
there is a minor change in the form I sent out. Everything after the
"INTRODUCTION" line should be double spaced.

Using something like a FOSSIL driver (a replacement serial port driver
that many BBSes use) you could do this.  I would imagine that it would
only encode when carrier is up and the BBS software sends an INT14 AX=xx
instruction to turn on encryption.

I mention this 'cause I am the Technical Contact for fidonet.org.  The
fidonet.org domain is served out of ieee.org, and with some of the
gating that Burt is doing, the fidonet.org domain is not being appended
to the fidonet address and ieeee.org is.  The ieee.org domain is not
something I would guarentee as working all the time or permenate.  You
would have less potenial problems if you used fidonet.org.
