Who the heck are the Dork Slayers? Do they use guns/ swords/
explosives/ other deadly stuff ?? to eliminate Dorks? ;-)
Or maybe they should be called, "The Slayers of Dork Inc."... :-)

And I can't find a stupid computer and a printer in one place that
prints postscript so I still haven't been able to give in my

@_subject: Re: open-pgp / s/mime interoperability 
Abstract: "Should I buy PGP or S/MIME?" Well, I just want to remind something, something that someone else has
mentioned not so long ago, and it's this: PGP is Open Source, while
S/MIME is not.
This means PGP and it's algorithms have been scrutinized over, while
S/MIME has not... Although this might not be enough to decide weather
to use PGP or S/MIME, I would give a '+' to PGP for making an effort
to be accountable, and a '-' for S/MIME for being secretive.

DSA is a signature-only algorithm. Consequently, you aren't doing a
"decryption" with it when you evaluate a signature. I recommend you
look in
a crypto source book, like Schneier's "Applied Cryptography" or
van Oorschot, and Vanstone's "Handbook of Applied Cryptography" for
of how DSS is done. There is also source code available from a wide
of places.

@_subject: Polish Telecommunications 
Polish Telecommunications [Telekomunikacja Polska, TP S.A..]
I went to Polish Telecommunications on the 21/12/1998 [na ul. Zamenhoffa w Warszawie - on Zamenhoff St. in Warsaw] and inquired what was being done about the Millennium Bug. What I got from a medium important chief was that there was an article not long ago about it, the name of the journal escapes me. She seemed pretty angry that I even asked about it. What made me angry was that she didn't know what was the bloody problem. Total ignorance. But I guess Polish Telecommunications are going to get a kick out it when the year 2000 finally does arrive.
