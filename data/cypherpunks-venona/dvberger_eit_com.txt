Just read through the stack of news this was based on (comp.security.unix)
The Berkeley folks rightly point out that if I trust an NFS to send me a
binary, then an interaction with the server sans authentication/encryption
can leave me with a compromised binary.  This is valid when I get my binary
from out on the net.  This seems much less valid when I live behind a
firewall and trust my fellow workers who have access to the server, the
wires coming out of my cube, and my whole machine for that matter.
As a result, the only thing I think this article should say is that we need
secure ftp.  Isn't this being worked on?
As for the article - 9/10 scaring people, 1/10 semi-fact.  Be serious?  NFS
is not the basic structure of the Internet.  I'm embarrassed that an article
so weak in its explanations and so high on fluff appeared on the front page
of a well respected newspaper.

No I don't think the community missed the point.  While both NFS and FTP are
equally weak in the way you point out, I think you should have used FTP as
your main example because if we presume that the file server where the
binary lives is reasonably trustworthy (like the guys at Netscape haven't
inserted a trojan horse into their own binary and placed it up for FTP) then
the way the file will propogate throughout the net is FTP and not NFS.
Nonwithstanding, the NY Times writer took an otherwise reasonable point and
blew it up into a "War of the Worlds" style article.  I'd make sure he
writes a decent article before quoting me in it.
