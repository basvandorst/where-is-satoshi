Was this a real message, or is someone having us on? I mean, come on, who seriously describes themselves as "MacGuru" AND puts in their anonymous
email address as well :)
Not very anonymous now is it?

@_subject: HTML "printenv" 
Hi all,
A while back, there was mention of a WWW URL that gave back all the details passed between one's client and a server.
Can anyone remember the URL? I remember it ended in "printenv"
Thanks for the help.
