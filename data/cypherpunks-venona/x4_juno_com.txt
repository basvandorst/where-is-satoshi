Last night, ABC news once again stroked the fires of fear and raised the
boogieman of "Hackers" destroying the goverment, banks, power plants, ad nauseum.  Of course, the main guest was from the US Govt's new trumpeter of CyberTerrorizm, "the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure
Protection".  A full transcript is available.
Revolution in a Box -- Cyber Terror -- AIR DATE: Monday, Dec. 8, 1997
ABC technology correspondent Gina Smith investigates the vulnerability of
our nation's computer systems and what is being done to protect them from
the threat of hackers.
Guest: Jamie Gorelick, co-chair, Advisory Committee of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection
Jamie Gorelick: Well, there are a number of things we can do. I mean, the
effort that has been started already is one to build a partnership
between the government and the private sector to work together to know when we're being attacked, to share information, to ensure that we have the right research and eventually to be in a position to respond to an attack
with the best efforts we can.
