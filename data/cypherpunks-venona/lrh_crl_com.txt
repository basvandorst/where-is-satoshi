OSC has already used their modified L1011 to launch a Pegasus.  Last month they launched a stretch Pegasus from the plane for the first time.  Unfortunately they are using new control software in the Pegasus and it did not properly take into account the difference in the Phugoid frequency of the stretched bird.  The result was positive feedback in the yaw control loop causing failure of the main wing.  A self destruct charge was detonated from the control facility aboard the L1011.  They are due to try again sometime soon.

I, too have gotten a similar message, and only after sending my first message to the cypherpunks mailing list.  I most certainly *DID NOT* send any message using the anonymous contact service and I DEFINITELY want that code name killed.  I'll send the code number to Julf in a separate message.  Jim, you are not alone!

No, and I don't either, but now someone else can use those accounts and LOOK like they are you or me (or anyone else here).  Now suppose some twit decides to use one or more of those accounts to send threatening messages to the president or some other stupid thing... who are they going to come after, do you suppose?  NOT a nice scenario!

@_subject: Re: "Anon" fake... 
Perry (and other c'punks),
  I don't think the mechanism employed by the hacker is using "who" at all.  Rather, it is someone who is subscribed to the list and has a program which looks at the author of each message to see if it is someone already in their database.  If it is someone new, it automatically sends a message for that person into the anon service.  If not, it simply ignores the message.  There are LOTS of silent listeners on the list and it could be ANY of them.  Stoping this is not going to be easy.  I don't suppose Julf would be interested in recording the name of the site where all these requests are originating?  Any other ideas?

@_subject: Adding PGP capability to Majordomo 
This sounds great, though I am somewhat confused about the mechanism and effect... just giving Majordomo a keyset would not (at least to my understanding) cure the problem of an??? recipients resulting in new an??? accounts.  Perhaps I am missing something fundamental here, but what would this buy us?

@_subject: Direct Satellite phone service 
I am currently working on the IRIDIUM(r) effort.  IRIDIUM is an international consortium which will fly 66 (+spares) satellites in polar orbits to achieve a global space-based cellular phone system.  It is significant that *ALL* government involvement from *ANY* government or agency is being avoided by the IRIDIUM consortium.  This is just good business: Who in another country wants to use a system that they know will
be monitored in some secret way by their own or some other country's intelligence service?  Instead, no encryption will be included in the mission (telephone) data portion of the IRIDIUM system.  If a subscriber wants to use their own crypto-system on top of the basic communication service provided by the system, that is up to them.  On the other hand, if no encryption is provided by the subscriber, anyone can listen into their conversations.
As to preventing unauthorized use of the system, I know less.  While it would be relatively easy and cheap to use any of our well known authentication protocols with strong crypto to prevent such crimes, I don't know if its use as a standard part of the system is planned.

@_subject: Re: Satellite Cellphones 
Your understanding of how IRIDIUM(r) will work is incorrect.  It most certainly WILL be the NORMAL operating mode for a subscriber unit (cell phone, if you will) to talk to another subscriber unit by only going through satellite links.  The caller will be authenticated via a "home" equivalent to the MTSO switch, but the call itself will NOT go through the switch (or any other) unless it is to a phone number which is not a subscriber unit. ONLY in that case will the call be routed through the MTSO equivalent.
  Your thoughts about caller authentication are correct.  I don't know if IRIDIUM is planning to do this correctly or not.
