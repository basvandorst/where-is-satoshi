the workers to protect their immediate interests against the
 employers.
         In addition to organizing industrially, the workers will need
 a political party to spread the idea of social ownership, and to gain
 the supprt of the majority at the polls.  When this is achieved, the
 workers will assume control of their workplaces, and manage them
 democratically through their New Unions.  An elected Congress of
 delegates from each industry will plan and manage the national
 economy, and will replace the present political Congress as the
 nation's government.

No, you didn't.  "Convicted" is not the same thing as "innocent", how does
that grab you?  Conviction logically follows being proven guilty.  And guilty
is the opposite of innocent, at least on my planet.

Dolty is very predictable.  While it looked like Mr. Pat was going to pull
ahead, his spew was directed at him.  Now, that Mr. Bob is forging ahead,
expect Dolty to start ranting against Mr. Bob.  You wait, in a few months
he'll be saying nice things about Mr. Pat.  Mark my words.  This loser is not
really interested in anything factual to discuss.  He is so deathly afraid of
Mr. Bill being sent back to Arkansas, that he would blaspheme even against God
himself, if he was running on the Republican ticket.
Wrong.  You are rarely right on anything.
