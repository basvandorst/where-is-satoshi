Voter's Telecomm Watch (Shabbir J. Safdar ) told me the vote was unanimous.  Their recent "Wiretap Watch" lists a bunch of Senators who voted to let it leave the committee, but none who wanted to kill it.  The Legi-Slate Congressional database service says only that it was approved by a voice vote.
