Depleted uranium is used in armor piercing rounds for three reasons:
1.  High density
2.  High hardness - not quite that of tungsten, but its up there.
3.  Upon impact it ignites (like magnesium) and burns.  The burning uranium
melts steel and also produces uranium oxide in the process.  If this isn't
"violent" enough, try fission.
