I traveled by train all the way to Florida from Rhode Island once.  24
hours straight it took man and I swore I would never do it again. 40-50 people per car and basically one bathroom per car.  Come morning
time man, the lines for the bathrooms stretched out of the cars. Screw that, I could have flown and made it in 3 hours. Plus it's
easier for the gov't to stop trains and search them, I'd rather go
with the flight.

That's cool man, I see your point.  Guess I shouldn't knock it when
I've only had one experience.  It's true, I got on the train quicker
than I've ever gotten on a flight and didn't face any harrassment. Actually, I faced more harrassment from my Gestapo math teacher in
high school trying to board a bus than getting on the train.  He
looked at me and told me I was trouble and searched every crevice of
my bag, personal being and space.  "But doctor, both your hands on my
shoulders. . ."you get the point and that's exactly what's happening
to us each and every day.   24

Who knows for sure anymore.  Because of the "Anti-Terrorism" bill, it
is required that security be beafed up.  When they scan the ID, it is
to check against their records that you are who you say you are. . .so
they say.  In actuality, they are tracing movements of people, so if
the shit comes down, they will know where everyone is, no matter where
you flew to.  Even with trains, all's it will take is one bomb and you
better believe security will be pumped up as high as it is with
airlines.  Who knows anymore, there's so much going on at every
spectrum of this globe that the probability of keeping up with a minor
fraction is hard enough.  The gov't control's all major transportation
routes, which control's movement and where everyone is at all times. Soon, there will be no where to run to.

Sorry guy, no gettingout of dodge on this one.  There are no
utilities, no programs, no way out.  The only way to do this is to
copy the "mail file" which will be in the c:\notes\data directory and
blow away the id and recreate it.  Then after this, copy the mail file
back into the data directory.  This will recreate your desktop view
with the original folders and messages that you had.  Otherwise,
you're screwed.

Interesting, I like that.  It makes sense.  Bill Clinton knows all
about putting things in fromt of trains, like the two kids who found
his secret cocain dumping ground in Arkansas when he was governor, so
he dumped their two bodies on a train track and the train (spotting
them, like you said Ken) tried to stop but hit them.  Further
investigation found that they had died of a massive hemorage, but
Clinton's honest people told the public that they had "fallen asleep
on the railroad tracks and were accidently hit by a train." Convenient, if I've ever noticed.
    I guess the thing with trains is that they are fun and a nice
ride, but modern societies push to get there quickly escalates about
as fast as inflation, so the demand to fly is becmoming more popular
as time goes on.  I think in the future, the only need for trains will
be for shipping us cpunks off to the concentration camps, seeing as
most are only accessible by train or helicopter anyway.  We'll see
though.   causing a

They say education is power abd naybe they were correct.  I agree with
the fact that more people need to use encryption, the problem (as you
stated) is that people do not understand how to use it, or even know
it exists.  Unfortunate for us, fortunate for big brother.  While the
only way we can counteract this debate is through empowerment, the
question remains, how do you spread the word to up to a million
people, enough to get their interest and keep it, enough to take the
time to teach them how to use the tools.  I work for an IT department
and the users I train rank from intelligent to "where the hell did you
come from?!"  Teaching people who have no want or need is the hardest
part, just ask Christians, they know what it's like.  Our greatest
problems lie within our inability to train and make use of what lies
in front of us, if people don't see the need, then why would they?
  Another point, some people feel that if they have nothing to hide,
then why use it.  An acquaitance of mine has the same stubborn
attitude, what steps do you take to thwart that?  That excuse bothers
me beyond belief, but it is a common thought that if you need to take
the steps to hide something, then it must be wrong.  God help us. . .

I wonder sometimes whether or not there is hope for us to ever stop
this tyrrany.  I've seen a bunch of us diss the strike saying it was
an outlandish and foolish idea, but I hadn't seen anyone of you come
up with something better.  That act of protest, no matter how small,
serves to raise awareness.  Whether it's five minutes after finding
out that a war has errupted, or ten years into the war, each serves
its purpose.  At least it was na idea, it was a start.  We're never
going to be able to do anything at all if we don't start somewhere and
the strike seemed as good an idea as any.  Hopefully we can follow in
the footsteps of our ancestors who fought and died for freedom, true
freedom not this crap we see displayed on the tube everynight.  I hope
we don't fall into that catagorie of the kinds of people that talk and
talk and never do, for if this is the case, then we have already lost
and might as well drive ourselves to the concentration camps.  Ogre bounces like sonar. . .Peace.

It only took one to turn India around.  Ghandi nearly starved to
death, used nothing but passifism and won the race man.  You can't
discredit the labors of a few, wonderous things can happen when 3
people bond together for a common cause.  To much negativity in this
world already, I don't wish to add to it.  We've got nothing left but
hope and what a large flame a small spark can ignite.
