I'm looking for info, articles, archives, book and journal leads on
info related to applied cryptology in the 20th century... for a senior

Specifically, I'm looking for
o Clipper chip archives of articles
o Articles on Phil (PGP) and RSA disputes
o Articles on the export of cryptology
I'd also like info on cryptology in the Cold War or leads to
such info.
Please send info to: genghis

Don't mail those case studies to genghis
It was a dormant account my brother used to keep in touch with
friends from work (when he worked there).
He said he could forward mail to me from there... well, it looks like
they've closed down that account.
Sorry, send mail to goebelc1
