Hal is at  .
I have a prototype PGP-encryption implementation in Java, which I was
intending to build into a remailer _client_ (I think remailers
themselves will be better written in C for performance reasons, or at
least the crypto portions); at first, for 'type I' remailers, then
perhaps for mixmaster.
The prototype, which just encrypts to a public key, has been put at
 .  I'd appreciate people
looking over it, particularly the random number generation.
[The prototype is actually somewhat useful. It's about as secure as
downloading PGP in binary form... ]

If you glance at reg. 13b, under 'software', you'll find that it
specifically says '"software" means [program(s)] fixed in any tangible
medium of expression'.

@_subject: Anonymous remailer client in Java 
I have set up a Java client for type 1 anonymous remailers at
The client features a simple type-and-click interface, PGP encryption,
automatic remailer chaining, and a 100% java implementation---no
native code required. It has been tested under Netscape and Sun's
AppletViewer on MacOS and Solaris. It will let you create simple reply
blocks (those which don't encrypt the message).
This is intended as a better way to post mail anonymously via the
web (especially since Community ConneXion's https service seems to
have shut down).
- Persons in the US will not be able to use it unless they have a
license from RSA (which is unlikely).
- It doesn't do Mixmaster remailers yet (but it will soon).
- It can't actually send the mail if you're behind a firewall, but it
will PGP encrypt a message for you to send.
- It has to send all its mail via the HTTP server's machine because of
applet security restrictions---you can fix this by making a local
copy, or (if you're brave) giving it more permissions. The mail is
encrypted from your machine, so this isn't insecure, just slow and a
waste of bandwidth.
Ideally, it would run from a web site on the same machine as an
anonymous remailer, and use that as the first hop in the chain. If
anyone (outside the US, of course) would be interested in setting this
up, please e-mail me at the address below.
