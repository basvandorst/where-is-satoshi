@_subject: Re: ID of anonymous posters via word analysis? 
For the past few years I've looked at this issue (author identification
through text content analysis) a bit from a psycholinguistic point of view.
 According to an occasional electronic digest coordinated by a woman from
the UK named Blackwell (I apologize that I don't remember her name or have
her email address handy), a technique that sums the probabilities of
various word occurrences (CUSUM) has come under fire recently and, if I
remember correctly, is not accepted in UK courts.
A 1983 paper (which I also do not have the cite handy for) by Dr. Murray
Miron of Syracuse University gave his equations for analyzing two texts (of
roughly similar lengths) and establishing a probability that the two
writings were produced by the same individual.  In his paper, Dr. Miron
related the story of a trial where he was summoned as an expert witness and
was not allowed to testify as to whether an extortion note was authored by
the defendant based on analysis of the note vis a vis a known letter from
the defendant.  However, the jury ended up finding the defendant guilty
based on identical misspellings of a word in each message.  Dr. Miron noted
that the jury's decision agreed with the overall findings of the computer
analysis; however, the jury returned a guilty verdict based on a single
coincident misspelling that could happen (with relatively high probability)
in any two random messages.
The same idea applies here - for CUSUM or similar analysis to be valid, an
analyst needs large volumes of messages where one of the authors is known
(an anonymous id counts) and the documents compared are of similar lengths.
 One note a while back indicated that matching anonymous id's could be done
through tracing misspellings and uncommon word usage.  Definitely not true
without a large base of known messages from both id's and a high score on
an evaluation function as described in the literature.

Extending off Tim's comments:
Absolutely true, though the question is whether or not this analysis
provides a *unique* style signature for a given individual.  Note how
quickly jargon is passed around and how quickly you, in conversation,
acquire new phrases from your surroundings.
This is where I begin to disagree.  Suppose one or two individuals wanted
to conduct a debate on a subject and steer the discussion to a
predetermined issue space.  By creating multiple identities (as Peter and
Val did in _Ender's Game_ by Orson Scott Card, *shameless plug:  GREAT
BOOK*), one could achieve this or another goal by varying the ideologies
expressed in the writing and foil this style of analysis.  Also, there is a
question about the reliability of context-sensitive text analysis engines. If the engine is knowledge base-driven, it is unreliable outside its realm
of expertise; if it's a neural net-based package, the training collection
is very important.
The Net doesn't place a lot of emphasis on spelling and most posts/messages
aren't spell-checked, increasing the noise in the system.
Again, the "unique signature" problem.  Perhaps one could determine
regional background (New England, Deep South of the US etc.) from this
reliably, though I'm not sure how much farther the analysis could be
I would believe that these caveats are a significant barrier to establishng
a unique signature.
There is also the question of whether or not current text analysis programs
are capable of making these distinctions/correlations and whether or not
these distinctions can be communicated to the program overseers once they
are established.  My basic position is that text analysis packages are probably not advanced
enough to reliably analyze more or less extemporaneous utterances
transmitted in the form of email or posts.  However, I second Tim's call
for a text analysis on various messages, beginning with those of single
authors to check the reliability of the system.  I'm just an amateur and of
no real help technically, but there's bound to be someone in one of the
CS/AI departments around the world that could provide us with a reasonable
text analysis engine.

True, though the probability that two individuals would (over)use a
particular word or phrase is high enough where "heating things up" would be
unjustified, especially if spoofing were involved.  Consider the reverse of
the analytical process -- I want everyone to believe I'm Joe X, so I do a
text analysis of his messages, write my own, analyze my message in
comparison with Joe's, and modify it until the (or an) engine's algorithms
spit out a score indicating that I'm Joe.  Spoofing deluxe!
I don't mean to say that informal analysis doesn't have its place, but we
need to be careful about jumping to conclusions and potentially "heating
things up" for innocent individuals or "convicting" them in the Court of
Net.Opinion absent sufficient proof.  I would agree that these analyses
might form the basis for a reasonable suspicion that a particular
individual is resposnible for bothersome anonymous posts, providing grounds
for sysadmin notification.

One element of the "right of privacy" debate I've seen is the distinction
between a "right _of_ privacy" and a "right _to_ privacy".  Linguistically,
"right _of_ privacy" == "privacy right", indicating that this particular
right would be enumerated somewhere.  In the case of a "right _to_
privacy", the concept is a bit more vague and allows the penumbral
(implied) construction given by Stanton.  Since there is no specific mention of a "right _of_ privacy" in the
Consititution, one must fall back on the implied construction and interpret
Constitutional privacy as defined by other amendments.  What this
construction of the "right _to_ privacy" allows is for appellate courts to
weight enumerated rights as more important than implied rights.  Thus, in

Strong words that, IMHO, put way too much faith in the argument that a
"restrictive" work environment inevitably crushes individualism and
creativity.  Any organization, .gov or !.gov, that:    *  recruits the best and the brightest and pays them well;   *  gives access to substantial computing/financial resources and academic         knowledge;   *  fosters team-building, creativity, and competition *within the group*;   *  rewards achievement and provides status *within the group*; and   *  provides other movitivation, be it patriotism/pride/whatever, will produce more than its fair share of advances in a field.  Given a
concentrated environment and an advanced set of tools, it seems improbable
that any group, regardless of organizational affiliation, could be
outperformed *on an evolutionary basis* by a loose band of academicians and
private researchers with irregular contact.  Revolutionary change is impossible to predict, though I feel that no
organization with sufficient resources would throw away promising methods
without thorough investigation.  Even so, I do personally believe that
private individuals may have an edge in revolutionary research. Unfortunately, both statements are unverifiable.
The key point to remember is that motivation is relative - regardless of
our personal opinions, if someone seeks status within a group then more
"restrictive" environments are not a hindrance to creativity.

While I'm not intimately familiar with the workings of the NSA, I would
guess that folks w/ Ph.D.'s and no/little work experience are probably
brought in near the top end of that range, though the advanced degree would
allow for quicker advancement to senior technical or management positions
and correspondingly greater pay.  Also, be sure to include the labor
surplus, government benefits and job satisfaction as factors in considering
salary adequacy.
MITRE pays me significantly less than what they would pay a Senior VP,
which is about the level where I would feel comfortable stating that I
"speak for" MITRE.  As for the team-building observations I made above,
they are made from a general management perspective and are open to debate,

A thought struck me yesterday (minimal damage as I saw it coming):  we
should collect references to/copies of Cypherpunks-related cartoons to have
on hand as a tool for spreading the word about electronic privacy.  For
example, I saw a Calvin & Hobbes (last week?) where Calvin's dad bought a
book by cash so the store couldn't track his purchasing habits; Hobbes'
comment in the last frame was something like:  "He's being dragged kicking
and screaming into the information age, eh?"  There's also the _New Yorker_
one with "On the Internet, no one knows you're a dog." and a few Bloom
County's from 1987(???) that feature "secret writing".  This set is perhaps
best summed up by the following (paraphrased) exchange between Opus and
Portenoy, the ground hog:
Frame 1:  Portenoy:  Opus, you're an UKRL head.
          Opus:  (Looks startled.)
Frame 2:  Portenoy:  (Looks happy/relieved)  I've always wanted to say that!
Frame 3:  Portenoy:  This freedom to say what we want is the true meaning of

Fellow C'punks-
This is a copy of a posting I made to comp.eff.org.talk and other groups.
In article  Robert I. Eachus,
David does raise a valid point that I don't think Robert deals with - how
does fighting Clipper help us in the struggle to prevent the outlawing of
all non-Clipper crypto?  If the CPSR and other organizations spend their
political capital on a losing fight, does the credibility loss kill
effective future resistance?
While the Clipper proposal *as it stands now* is most likely a done deal,
there are ways to keep up the pressure to make sure it doesn't snowball:
  o  Mount effective resistance against the Wiretap proposal and *link the
two issues* in the eyes of the public.  This shouldn't be done completely
up front - instead, the association should begin to build after a few weeks
or months to ensure that the original message is received and is not
blocked out by the "you already lost Clipper" signal;
  o  Quote export sale figures of Clipper technology often and loud - I
don't see how any foreign company would let such suspect equipment on their
property, let alone use it to transmit anything sensitive.  I truly hope
I'm not wrong on this count - if the tech sells, the case against Clipper
becomes darn near unwinnable;
  o  Track Clipper equipment purchases by US entities that do not have
government contracts;
  o  Maintain close vigilance over the law enforcement community.  How many
mid-level drug dealers would be willing to use Clipper technology to
implicate their bosses in exchange for lighter sentences?  Expect this
tactic and similar ones to be used;
  o  Compile a list and analysis of all crypto software and equipment
available overseas and compare it to commonly used US techniques.  If the
exported stuff has identical or near-identical functionality to the US
tech, there's no case for Clipper.  Combine this analysis with the export
figures and industry is bound to take notice, with their Congressional reps
following. There should be a follow-up analysis on foreign purchases before
and after Clipper is introduced.  THE FIRST PART OF THIS DOCUMENT SHOULD BE
PREPARED IMMEDIATELY!!!  If someone hasn't already begun this survey, I'll
volunteer and will put out a call for information shortly.
This battle needs to be fought on our ground - the Administration is
defining how the argument is being carried out, for now. Do we know what
our ground is?  What strategy we'll take to counter the Administration's
initiative?  The list I just gave is a series of tactical devices that
could produce specific effects, all of which are USELESS without a coherent
strategy to apply the information gained.  Do I have any suggestions? Nope, not beyond the tactics I discussed above.  I am, however, going to
start some serious cogitating and hope to come up with something.
That last bit shouldn't be seen as a slam on the EFF or CPSR as I don't
know what level of planning they've invested in strategy.  What I do know
is that we've lost the initiative and need to regain it; these newsgroups
are a great place to start, but most of us agree on the basic principles
that information should be free etc. etc. etc.  Why should Middle America
care what happens to terrorists and dope pushers?  How long until
"electornic privacy advocates" join that elite group?  It isn't time to
push the PANIC BUTTON yet, but there needs to be a heightened sense of
urgency in everything we do to fight against the possibility that the
Administration wants to ban all non-Clipper crypto.
That possibility scares the hell out of me and is enough to make me act

On March 8, Dr. Dorothy Denning was a guest speaker for LRNG 572 - Taming
the Electronic Frontier, a course at George Mason University.  The
professor, Dr. Brad Cox, is a veteran software developer who has turned his
attention to developing models for electronic commerce and
"student-centered education".  The latter is my own term for his concept of
students, through a demand-based process, having much more control over and
interaction with the university education process.  Brad has expressed strong opinions on several issues regarding personal
privacy and the Clipper/Digital Telephony proposals; I don't presume to
speak for him, but I should note that our homework includes installing PGP
2.2 or 2.3a on our personal machines, generating key pairs, distributing
our public keys, and broadcasting an essay encrypted with everyone else's
public keys.
The lecture was broadcast on the George Mason University channel, 48 on
Media General Cable Systems in Fairfax County, VA, and other channels
around the DC Metro Area.  Tapes are available in the GMU Library and, I
believe, may be copied and distributed freely.  If any of you would like a
copy of the session, I'll look into what has to happen to get it done.
I do not have a VCR at home and am not referring to the tape as I write
this summary, so there may be some inaccuracies.  Further, as I was not
taking careful notes, my own comments and questions are most prominent in
this summary.  In my note to the class, I'll ask them to contribute their
own views of the proceedings.  I am forwarding this note to Brad, Dr. Denning, and the class to ensure all
parties have the opportunity to correct any misrepresentations or
***The Presentation***
Dr. Denning was clearly nervous -- she indicated that she had never worked
with the combination of television, overhead projector and computer-cueing
system in the video classroom.  Also, I surmise that Brad had warned her
that she wouldn't be facing the most sympathetic audience in the world. Each student had written an essay about Clipper and emailed it to Brad,
cc'ing the rest of the class.  Most of the class didn't think
Clipper/Digital Telephony was a hot idea, but there were several
supporters. After a brief intro describing Clipper as a "voluntary" standard, she
quickly described the key initialization and two-party decryption
processes.  This part of the lecture was notation-laden and somewhat hard
for me to follow, and I've read most of Schneier's _Applied Cryptography_! The folks around me seemed to be lost in the particulars of how the various
keys were generated and interacted (especially the session key).  However,
I believe the basic points got through clearly enough - the class is mostly
professionals and is sophisticated enough to pick up anything that's
explained well.
After Denning indicated that NIST and Treasury were to be the two escrow
agents, I asked about VP Gore's 9 February remarks on the potential
problems of both agents being in the Executive Branch etc.  She glossed
over the issue by replying that the process was still being examined and
that she didn't see a problem with the two agents residing in the same
branch of government.  The theme that "the key escrow system prevents
abuse" resonated throughout her presentation.  A few minutes later, I asked Dr. Denning whether she her earlier published
(on Usenet, anyway) statements to the effect that if Clipper were made
mandatory she would probably withdraw her support for the standard.  She
did not dispute the basis of the question but did not answer it per se,
either.  Her final response (paraphrased) was that she could not foresee
all possible outcomes and did not want to commit herself to a position
without observable results.
After further questions, Denning described the Digital Telephony proposal,
stressing that the idea was to maintain the current level of wiretap
capabilities despite technological advances.  She was very careful to
delineate the goals for Clipper and Digital Telephony as follows:
  o  Clipper is designed to provide US citizens strong cryptography that
won't threaten US national security;
  o  Clipper is *not* designed to catch crooks;
  o  Digital Telephony is designed to maintain the current level of wiretap
capabilities and gives law enforcement officials no new abilities.
The first statement is hard to dispute on its face, despite the invocation
of that vague concept called "national security".  As many others,
including Tim May, have said, the government is fighting an imaginary enemy
which is, by virtue of it being imaginary, capable of anything.
If cellular phones, baby monitors (!) and regular telephones used
Clipper-like technology, many citizen-to-citizen privacy worries would be
solved since ham radio and scanner operators would be unable to monitor
these transmissions.  However, the idea that the standard is voluntary, an
idea she defended even when pressed that everyone in the government (except
the judiciary) answers to the same guy raises a question as to how
voluntary the standard is.
The second statement goes against much of the rhetoric Clipper supporters
have used to link the proposal to the War on Drugs and the general fear of
crime.  It's interesting to note that, even while she was disavowing
Clipper's link to catching crooks, she read anecdotes from the back cover
of a book entitled something like _The World's Dumbest Criminals_ and
opined that, if someone is dumb enough to call hotel security and report
$1000 of cocaine missing from his room, they just might be dumb enough to
use Clipper.  After all, they talk in the clear now!
I think this argument has gotten short shrift on Cypherpunks and does
deserve more attention.  If the price of ClipperPhones comes down enough so
that they're affordable _and_ there's no market competitor of note, why
wouldn't drug dealers use the equipment?  After all, even assuming the full
search warrent process is bypassed, the government needs to know what's
happening before they tap the line.
The solution, of course, is to market alternative crypto-boxes that can fit
between the phone unit and the wall socket.  Price competition against high
volume manufacturers will be a serious obstacle to successfully
circumventing the escrowed technologies.
The difference in the rhetorical significance of crime-fighting when
Clipper is presented to technical and non-technical audiences is
The final theme, that Digital Telephony adds no new law enforcement
capabilities, was not something anyone in the class seemed to have the
knowledge to dispute on technical grounds.  When I raised the issue of
phone calls being directed to central law enforcement sites instead of
requiring agents to move to a remote location, Dr. Denning indicated that
wiretaps are done by directing calls to a central location now.  While J.P.
Barlow challenged related issues in the America On Line debate, I have not
seen a refutation of this particular point.  Can anyone elaborate?
***Personal Notes and Editorials***
o  None of us brought up the government ability to request and examine
phone usage information without a warrant or pointed out that law
enforcement agencies currently do this more than 100,000 times per year. [I wasn't aware of the number until Barlow cited it on AOL.]  o  I would hope that the ability of government to accumulate behavioral
dossiers on private citizens through the information mosaic and link
analysis tools is something that would appear in _Time_ right beside the
Clipper and Digital Telephony expository articles in the future.  If
Digital Telephony makes this ability stronger, there is a greater danger of
the fishing expeditions and data matching exercises the 1974 Privacy Act is
designed to prevent.
o  In my opinion Dr. Denning sincerely believes these proposals will make a
positive difference; however, the sincerity of the advocate does not give
credence to the position advocated.

           Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., used the recent death of Senate
gym attendant Troy Brown as an opportunity to discuss his own much-noted
waistline problems. Brown, Kennedy told his colleages in late March, helped
him monitor his tendency "to gain a few pounds on occasion." While reassuring
the Senator that it had been OK to graze on eggs Benedict that morning, Brown
discreetly recorded Kennedy's weight in the back of the gym book so that no
other Senator could see them. "I knew he was on my side," Kennedy added, "when
he volunteered to keep my numbers in code."

Just as a bit of humor, not meant to be taken seriously.  I left out the

I guess all the publicity from the Time article, which cited the same
survey as CNN (by Yanklevich Partners), deadened the response.
I've begun to see reps of Yanklevich interviewed about public opinion on
CNN quite a bit recently.
