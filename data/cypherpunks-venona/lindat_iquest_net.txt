@_subject: Software Glitch FYI 
A Congressman's aid called me today to explain that if you send email to all
the Congressmen's offices at one time, the software at their end causes each
Congressman to receive 50 copies.
Please be sure everyone is aware of this glitch.
To prevent 50 copies from being sent to each Congressman, it is necessary to
break the mailing list into 5-10 addresses at a time.
Every list I've ever received of Congressional Emails has annoying spaces
and formats, so my list doesn't have that.  It can be copied directly into a
nickname box in Eudora or to a Bcc: list on a message.

During the Waco Hearings, Charles Schumer said he'd seen Foster's missing
file and all it had in it was a memorandum about "Linda Thompson and THAT tape."
Now, put that with the "sources say Foster's files dealt with legal
questions bout national emergencies . . . ." and I will presume that "THAT
tape" and I constitute a "national emergency."
At any rate, we've (AEN News) had a number of military-based sniffs here.

They asked for it:
"To secure Net communications, the government will need to
have access to private data exchanges using what is known as a key escrow
security system," -Netscape Communications chairman Jim Clark, arguing for
a security system called key escrow that would require you to give the
government access to your private messages.

 Netscape has a webpage at   There is a "toys" area and any
message you leave in that area goes to an ELECTRONIC MARQUEE SIGN at
Netscape that all the employees can see.  SPAM THAT SIGN.
(2) SPAM NETSCAPE

   Remember Waco.  The Murderers are still free.
The Army is going to courtmartial Spc. Michael New for not wearing a U.N. uniform, but the Army won't
courtmartial the members of the 160th and 158th
Special Operations, 82nd Airborne, Ft. Hood Cav
Members, and 10thMountain Division members who helped MURDER CHILDREN at Waco.
What's wrong with this picture?
