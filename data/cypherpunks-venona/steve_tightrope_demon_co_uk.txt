The signature file is too long and contains lame ascii? :)

Ummm why reinvent the PGP wheel in an exclusively Win32 form?  PGP (at
least 2.x) has undergone peer review and seems secure.  Is that true of
your system?
I don't wish to sound too negative and there are interesting features
(small EC keys for one and smaller signatures).
Another interesting and similar program is Pegwit which is portable code
and also has these advantages.
But there is an intrastructure of PGP key servers and most people have
PGP keys, already.  Maybe we should be building on standards rather than
building new ones.
Of course PGP isn't GPLed but we will have g10 soon which will be
real freeware and developed outside the USA to avoid legal problems
ftp://ftp.guug.de/pub/gcrypt/g10-0.1.3.tar.gz Its *very* prebeta but maybe will become the cypherpunk program of
There is also a freeware SSH ("Psssst") planned I think by someone else.

Hmm this is a very good point which may explain the limited use of PGP
on this list anyway.
I also wonder whether the low uptake of PGP is more due to it being too
hard to use between different mailers and too hard to use generally for
the nontechnical.
SMIME of course despite bad cypherpunk karma is easy and maybe even works between mailers.

Does anyone have any economic studies (or stories) which compare
the effectiveness of these approaches?

I wasn't impressed.
That main tent was an old circus tent and was huge with enough room for
one thousand people.  Unfortunately it had the effect of focusing and
amplifying the already excessive heat on the sweating and dehydrated
victims sitting in it.  By the final day an attempt had been made to
open it up a bit more and to spray cold water on it.
The first thing I saw was a demonstration of the "Van Eck effect".
The idea was to pick up the screen display of someone's monitor at a
distance to read the information off it.  The lecturer was a German
professor and spoke heavily accented English.  He was very much as a
German professor might be shown in a film.  He spoke a lot about "Ze
Incriminating Emissions", which seemed rather funny at the time.
He had an aerial, which looked like an unconvincing Dr Who prop,
attached to a standard TV.  The circus tent atmosphere led somehow
to the impression that he was a stage magician performing tricks.
Also the audience's habit of cheering after each trick didn't help.
On the target PC screen were a few words in a very large font and he was
able to display this up on the TV.  He also put a device around the power
 supply lead and could pick up a better picture this way.  There were
mutterings from the audience, many of whom seemed unimpressed.  At the
question session the poor chap got a rather hard ride.  The gist of it
being "What we have been shown is twenty years old, there are modern
digital techniques that are much better".  His reply was "They are very
expensive and we have only just got the equipment and the results aren't
finished yet."  The counter measures were Tempest shielding.
In short if your password is visible on your monitor in letters three
inches high and there is a van outside your office with a large aerial
and German plates this might mean trouble.  Or maybe the NSA can pick
 it up anyway from America using the "newer techniques".

I would recommend PERL as a powerful, compact language, which has many
crypto modules available.

This is probably bullshit since the source is available to open view...
However, given that few have the technical skills to audit this source
I wonder how easy it would be to insert a backdoor and what form it
would take?

are you sure?
according to
 PGP 6.0.2i available soon
The PGP 6.0.2 source code books have arrived in Europe, and work is
going on to scan them in and create an international version: 6.0.2i.
However, there are 25 volumes and over 12,000 pages, so it will
probably take a while to finish.

"The Machinery of Freedom" far from being published in the early '80s
was published in 1971 and is based on writings from the late '60s.
It is very much aimed at 60s alternative types a with relaxed writing
style, anti-drug law and pro freedom line.
This book when I read it through FCS in the early '80s convinced me I was a libertarian.  I didn't come across cypherpunk theory until much later and, when I did, I saw it obviously followed libertarianism.
I am sure Friedman was well aware on how technological advances could
weaken the state and to accuse him of "copying" is facile.
