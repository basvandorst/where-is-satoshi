This Californian now living abroad hears a great deal about what a violent place America is largely because we have the right to bear arms.  Of course, I remind these cretins that no other place on the world has a greater degree and respect for civil rights than does America.  Amazing when you consider that America is also the ultimate melting pot too.  Sure a lot of ethnic and racial tension still exists in America, but let's tour Europe:
1) Northern Ireland, where you have two groups who speak the same language and basically are cut from the same cultural cloth but religions differ
2) The Bosnia region:  different languages and religions, possibly different cultures although the years under Tito must have forced the people represented here (the Catholic Croats, the Eastern Orthodox Serbs, and the Muslims) to understand a little of each other's culture
3) Cyprus:  different languages and religions for sure, but Greeks and Turks are really brothers and sisters under the skin (i.e., are more alike than they care to admit to)
Look at the savagery and genocidal activities of the groups involved in those conflicts now and historically.
The kind of ethnic/subcultural strife and difficulties in America  pales in comparison to the kind of savage killing and cold-blooded enmity that these "Europeans" have for one another.  That'll be the day when any European gives me a sanctimonius lecture about civil and human rights as they oughta be!
Don't tell me about the Americans who have left their homeland--maybe moved to Europe ;-) --and said, "Man, am I glad to be rid of my motherland and glad to be here."  You will always find the anecdote here and there.  And sure for some Americans it will be a step up from whatever hell they thought they were living in the States.  But don't expect in the next 10 generations to see Americans in a mass migration to get away from all urban violence ("because of our stupid gun freedom laws") to move to the relative police states that exist everywhere outside of America (with the possible exception of Canada--I love those Canadians).  You European snobs should really get a grip yourselves!

Painting America with a rather broad brush, aren't you?  I never went to a school--and I attended public schools for ALL of my education--which had a metal detector.  But comparing America and Canada is pretty much apples and oranges again.  Do you [in Canada] really have our ethnic mix?
America's violence problem is not one bit related to guns everywhere in the street.  There are much deeper problems, including distrust between ethnic groups.  The O.J.Simpson was a real eye-opener on black-white relations, for example, and I think the Native Americans have yet really to speak about the shitty way they have been treated over the years.  By the way, have Canada's European descendants come to proper terms with its native American neighbors?

[much interesting exposition on the police as servants of government I have a question:  has any jurisdiction (local, state, federal) in the U.S. resolved the hyprocrisy--maybe better to phrase "double standard"--wherein citizens who commit crimes against persons who perform duties under the color and badge of authority--namely the police--are charged with additional offenses specific for crimes against govt officers--but govt officers who commit crimes against citizens while in the performance of duties under the color and badge of authority would suffer the same penalty as citizens who commit crimes against "just" citizens?  (hope you can follow that perhaps awkward question)
It is my opinion that if I am charged with felony assault on a police officer, and the judge gives me 2 years for the assault + 1 year for doing it to an officer, that if that cop gets rough with me beyond what is legally necessary (excessive force?) or does it in the commission of other crimes and does so having informed others that the officer is performing his duties (this resolves disputes between the concept of "on-duty" and "off-duty"), then he should get 2 years for the crime + 1 year for having violated the public trust vested in him (i.e., doing while "under the color and badge of authority").  I don't know why I think this way, but it's a concept I call FAIRNESS or maybe JUSTICE.

Since radioactive decay is first-order, the following equation       N = N  exp(-kt)
           0
where N=amount of material at time 't'; N = amount of material at time
t; k=decay rate constant; t=time of interest.
The decay rate constant (k) for first-order decay processes can be
expressed as k = ln(2)/half-life.
Hence the equation can be expressed as follows:
    N / N  = exp(-[ln(2)/half-life]*t)
         0
N / N  will express the amount of substance remaining as a percentage      0
of the original.
Plugging in the numbers:
      exp(-[ln(2)/250,000y]*6y) = 99.998%
Hence, ca. 0.002% (actually less than that) of the material has decayed.  It may be the case that even this minute amount of "impurity" could poison something like weapons-grade material, but I
am not a radioactive materials expert.

commented thusly:
The question is why she shook the baby at all.  If you have a sick baby, you call the emergency medical services, period!   And especially if the child is not your own.
This 19-year old was way out of her league and not at all fit for child care activities.  I am a firm believer that baby care for 3 year olds and less should be licensed.  The requirements for the license would be minimal.  It just merely shows that you understand that babies less than 1 year of age often cry--some hardly at all, others damn near all the time--and that 97% of the time there is a reason that can be found and the solution implemented, and the other 3% of the time the reason is beyond our understanding, but things will just seem to take care of themselves.  The licensing procedure might also be a way of checking if you have the minimal temperment to deal with infants and small children.
I frankly think the 19 year-old is guilty of negligent homicide (that is, causing the death of the baby because of ignorance of proper baby care).  I could go on and on about my idea of proper parenting (and baby care), but I don't think the people on this list would like the drift.
Having lived on the outside of America now for some time, I know that those who are not Americans have a hard time figuring out our justice system.  But although each state has its own set of penal codes, they are pretty much uniform in their agreement about trial procedure regarding disposition of felonies.  I think there is a reasonable argument that the prosecution should be interested in justice or in being a representative of The People of the State of ...:  does the prosecutor really believe that the accused committed the crime, or is there a district attorney election coming up and this murder rap has to go down soon?
What about the judge?  His first purpose is to make sure the law is followed, especially with respect to trial procedure.  But with the law is JUSTICE!  It has always been my belief that the ultimate goal of these sacred occasions is justice.  In California--from where I come and a state which often leads in setting standards of jurisprudence--the judge has the absolute right to overturn a guilty verdict or modify it in some way rather than let it go to an appellate court and make those guys mad.
The judge in this case never overturned the verdict (an action appealable in any case) but said she was guilty of the crime of shaking the baby to death, but not intentionally.  Since the 19 year old doesn't deny shaking or "rough handling" the baby, there is no reasonable doubt.  In my state, she is guilty of voluntary manslaughter.  I also would have sentenced her to receive instruction on how to be a better parent and how to "chill out" whenever a baby cries.  gawdhelpusall, but one day this woman may be a mother!
I am rather curious to know where public opinion lies in the UK, just to get a fix on cultural differences.

commented thusly:
I'd say it was entirely the question (or perhaps you can tell me the specific question you are addressing).  She was in court because there are certain people in this world whether it is appropriate to be physical in any manner--even when attempting to be (medically) helpful--with an infant, small child, perhaps even a minor.
Don't get me wrong...I am no socialist who is saying that govt is there to do everything for us.  You didn't read in any of my messages that I took away the ultimate responsibility from the parents, who are the last word in securing the best interests of their children.  I currently live in a society which might be an anarchist's dream in certain respects:  there is virtually no licensing whatsoever of the things you take for granted:  child care, operating a motor vehicle.  (Actually there is a licensing system for drivers, but a law is only a law if it is enforced, and since enforcement is virtually nil or at the least haphazard).  I will support a mandatory licensing scheme for child care as long as the govt involves itself with licensing other less important matters that themselves supposedly require licensing:  such as the practice of medicine or the practice of law or the practice of plumbing.  Licensing--in my eyes, is but a simple barrier to leap yet tough enough to show that you are serious about getting into this business.  I care less that barbers & surgeons & physicians & various other bloodletters, as well as the guy who knows that shit runs downhill and Friday is payday (the common electrician's joke about plumbers) are licensed than that someone (or some nongovt organization) has taken the first step for me and is willing to endorse the smiling face at my door who is to be entrusted with my spawn.  Throw out ALL licensing schemes and then I'll consider de-regulation of barriers to child killers and molesters.
I was overreaching when I said that the licensing procedure would involve a psychoanalysis or something like that.  The licensing procedure would only involve a simple test wherein you are asked questions about baby care and how you might respond to certain situations.  It might not even flunk the test-taker who said "If I see an incessantly screaming baby, I am most like to throw it through the wall."  The licensing procedure would be a way of informing or reminding someone about to undertake this task just what their liabilities are if something goes wrong and they were ignorant of the things they should have done.  In this case, the "check" on temperment is an inquiry into "how much do you really understand about what you are going to do?"
The licensing of medicine and law and plumbing is really nothing but an acknowledgement that you know how to conform to standard practice and are aware of the heresies of tradition and convention.  You might undertake to do something radical and unacceptable to your colleagues or the standards set by your professional society, but you are warned that you assume the blame if something goes wrong.
Are you saying wisdom and justice can only be had when we put the decision to a larger number of people, presuming an appellate court is not itself the purview of a SINGLE appellate court justice?  Some anarchist on this list must have mentioned the principle of AMERICAN justice:  it is better to let nine guilty men go free than let one innocent man go to prison.  For better or worse, that is the American way.  You will note that an American judge (Roy Bean excepted) can overturn a guilty verdict, but not an acquittal.  It is rarely done anyway, since CNN's cameras are not in every courtroom and few foreign nationals get led in chains to American docks.
Do I think justice was done?  How the hell should I know!?  I was not in the courtroom, although I do admit to having made a judgement (guilty of involuntary manslaughter;  I correct an earlier statement where I said 'voluntary manslaughter').  The burden of this entire matter is now on the judge's shoulders, and if there is a God, may this God show as much mercy to the judge as he showed to Woodward.  (The parents can go to hell.)
The answer to the poll question probably is meant to reflect:  "did she shake the child TO DEATH?" and the masses are probably replying in this Despite what foreign nationals might believe, 99.9% of American judges (i.e., those not in the United States Supreme Court and in the federal court system) make it their duty to insulate themselves from public pressure on these matters.  Most of them truly don't give a damn what the American public thinks about them or that they may be reversed on appeal, assuming the judge truly believes in what he/she is doing.  I think the judge in the Woodward case saw through all the public relations campaigning and press offensive.  He knows how media-intensive the open American criminal and civil justice has become, especially if he has been on the bench 10 or more years, and he knows that the baby is dead and cannot be resurrected and he wants to see Woodward understand what happened and realize if she had any responsibility and also important, whether she is remoresful if she is to shoulder some of the blame.
I suspect he looked for all these things, and figured that Woodward has been sufficiently punished, truly guilty or not.  As for Americans not quite impressed with the "stiff upper lip":  I know quite a few Englishmen here who think that the reserved one is me.  I think "the stiff upper lip" is something the British tourism industry likes to promote, and that Prince Charles is told to maintain despite it going against his nature.
I wasn't privy to the media blitz in the states (I can't even get CNN International here!) during the trial, but I rather suspect this crap also sickens quite a few Americans.  Not every black person in America wanted to set OJ free just because he was 'a bruh thuh goin' agin' the system.'  And not every white guy wanted to hang the double murderer either.  I know in the end however, that a British jury would set their minds on the case of an American defendant, not voting innocent just 'cause the parents want to preen before the national press (and make book deals), and not voting guilty just cause American culture, if it exists, turns their stomach.

[news clip  regarding new Deadbeat Parents federal law excised]
I have a strong feeling that this new law is going to turn around and bite the Great Society II (GSII) advocates in their federal ass.  Considering some of the minimum limits regarding child support sums in arrears, it really won't take any time for prominent members, subscribers, and believers in GSII, including Friends of Bill and Friends of Hillary, to find themselves on the other side of a federal arrest warrant.  The $5000 limit could be reached in a matter of a few months, it seems, for quite a few of even the "middle-class" child support payers.  (Anyone reading this who pays child support willing to divulge how many months it would take for them to reach that limit?)  I don't believe that deadbeat parents should evade their responsibility, but this law pretty much is the wrong way to deal with it.
Prosecutors of any stripe are not going to bother with making a judgment regarding 'intent', which they probably don't consider their duty anyway. They will have a formulae all worked out in concert with the presiding judge--whose duty should be the 'justice' end of any bum rap, deciding the issue of 'intent'--to nail anyone who violates the letter (and disregard the question of the violation of the spirit) of the law.  The poor will necessarily cop a plea and probably do some federal time AND/or find themselves assessed federal fines that will essentially make them indentured servants to the state for years.  The rich will work a deal to stay out of prison since the feds don't want to waste time with the delaying tactics of their savvy lawyers.
Perhaps at some point, after thousands of well-meaning but misfortunate parents find themselves considered felons in their society because they got behind in the support although there was no clear intent to do so, the law or certain elements of it will be sensibly repealed or reformed to target those whose intent to evade is really indisputable.  There are probably as well "minor" provisions and clauses in the law not reported in the news clip, but which certainly make life impossible for the well-
meaning to obtain complete rehabilitation;  those parts of the code would need attention as well.
