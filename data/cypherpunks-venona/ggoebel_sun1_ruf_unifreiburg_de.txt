@_subject: Add Me to the List 
I have tried many a time, to send mail
asking to subscribe to cypherpunks-request
I have never received any list mail.
I think I have been added to the announce list...
but I would greatly appreciate it if someone would add me on to the main list.

@_subject: cypherpunks vs. cryptoprivacy 
} I agree with those who think that "CypherPunks" is a bad name for the list.
} It brings up negative associations in the minds of outsiders, who are, after
} all, the people who we want to influence against the Big Brother wiretap chip
Is anyone against changing the name from cypherpunks to cryptoprivacy?
Seems to be the general consensus... that cryptoprivacy would be more PC.
Unoriginal Thought:  couldn't the list/group name be changed to "CP"?
o  For outsiders, and formally, it could stand for CryptoPrivacy
o  To insiders... it could still stand for CypherPunks
o  CP is the opposite of PC (I like that).
back to lurking,

Hi,     I was also the "anonymous" poster of the Mykotronx information :)
      ^^^^
It is genuine.
Don't ask me how I did it. It's a secret.  Besides, you probably
wouldn't believe me anyways :(
See ya,
(thanks for the confidentiality)
