@_subject: Re: MAIL: chained remailing strategy 
I was curious about the pros and cons of anonymous remailers holding and randomly sending outgoing mail.  It seems to me that the risk of a third party determining the original sender of an anonymous piece of mail through the use of timestamps is less pressing than the risk presented by the physical storage of that mail on someone's machine for extended periods of time.
Of course, with chained remailing, these risks dramatically decrease, but would I rather have the first remailer in a chain storing my mail until midnight or immediately bouncing it to another anonymous remailer?
