Vladimir's post was very good.  I only take issue with the last bit.
So long as you remember that when these things come out we still need to scream and yell about them.  The Rimm Job is not a victory simply because Rimm was crazy.  It's a victory because many people took the time to criticize it and many others took the time to inform the masses of that criticism.
These attacks may go in our favor, so long as we direct them in the right direction.  There's something Zen in that as well.  Don't punch your charging opponent.  Instead misdirect hir energy a bit and let hir run into that wall behind you...
