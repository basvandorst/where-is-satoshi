[note: i'm not the original 'anonymous user' in this thread]
I, for one, pay very little attention to the author of any
given message on this list, and messages stand on their own
merit. I take everything I read (here and elsewhere) with
a grain of salt, and pay close attention to factual references
if they are supplied to I can do my own investigating and
draw my own conclusions, if the topic piques my interest.
An anonymous posting has exactly the same 'integrity quotient'
as any first-time poster; the reader has no historical perspective
on the author, and the message should be  accepted or discarded
on its own merits, not by a blind "he's usually clueful" or
"who the heck is this?" attitude.
[erm.. I'm not attacking anyone here, just spewing some thoughts
 I haven't bothered to express yet..]
[Obligatory _Ender's Game_ reference grudgingly suppressed]
This happens in 'real life' all the time. I hide the details
of my geeky job from my Friday-night friends, and don't bring
up my recreational pharmaceutical use with my business associates.
Either group would have different feelings about me if they
had a 'combined picture' of my lifestyle. Personally, I find the quest for employment of any True Name scheme
hogwash, simply because of the multifaceted nature of human existence
(see above), where pseudonimity (virtual or social) is a part of everyday life.
True Names are logically almost impossible anyway. What base criteria
would a government, company, or other organization use to assign
and make use of a True Name? Driver's license? (fake) .. DNA fingerprint?
(cloning) .. any attempt to pin /me/ down to a single facet of existence is doomed to failure, given how adept the bad guys are
at keeping ahead of the good guys.
We all have hidden agendas; personally, until I reach godlike status
(btw, anyone have any spare eye of newt laying around?) I'll have
to be content with judging most things I read with a healthy dose of cynicism, and squeeze what 'truth' I can out of it. I've been surprised too many times by hidden goals and 'double agents' to put
much stock in /anything/ sent down my pipe.
There's also an argument that the most prolific pseudonyms and 'real'
account-holders have Something They Want Us To Believe and should be
trusted no further than they can be thrown .. analogous, in my book,
to politicians .. perhaps the anonymous are the /only/ entities we
can trust...
Oinker - anonymous today in case any of you are my clients :P
