I've got Hal's PGP mods to the remailer code installed on rebma.
The remailer is remailer and the PGP key to use is:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.0
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
See Hal's previous messages for how to use the remailer, or write me, and
I'll dig his messages up.
I liked Fen's idea about bartering remailers.  I'm all for it.

I got the metamail stuff running on my machine.  I think it's a good way to
get the multimedia mail job done.
Does anyone on the list have a better .mailcap entry for pgp than the application/pgp ; pgp < %s ; label="PGP encrypted text" ; compose="pgpcompose %s"
where pgpcompose is a quick hack that looks like:
rm /tmp/pgpcompose
vi /tmp/pgpcompose
echo What key?
read key
pgp -mae /tmp/pgpcompose $key
mv /tmp/pgpcompose.asc $1
exit 0
I've just been fooling around with metamail for a couple days, and I don't
know what the best way to include PGP is...  This seems to work, but I'm
guessing I'm missing something more elegant.
