I will be taking off early this week so I can get a good start on the holiday this weekend. Happy 4th of July!!
New Spread Spectrum Surveillance Modules
There are some new spread spectrum products coming into the US by way of China, and are starting to show up in Spy Shops on the West coast, Chicago, and Miami area. Two sided, four layer, surface mount PCB, several RF and audio IC's, several pots, coils, etc. Device is a raw module, designed for covert installations in an office or SOHO environment.
SM connector for antenna, micro molex connector for power and computer/serial interface.
PCB is 1.5 mm wide, 3.25 mm long, and .5mm thick.
Products are all based on a cordless telephone chip set, 780 Mhz to 980 Mhz, Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (BPSK/QPSK?). Analysis of RF section indicates good response from 610 Mhz to 1090 Mhz.
Serial data rates between 56 kb/s and 784 kb/s (12 full audio channels capable).
Devices have a two way RS422 serial port to facilitate setup prior to field usage.
Programmed RF power levels range is spec'd between 50mw and 250mw, suspect the circuits will operate as low as 5mw. Evaluation of the RF amp indicates that RF section should support a full watt of power with no problem.
Recommended voltage is 3/6vdc, but circuit should work fine on 9 or 12vdc.
Connections for two or three wire transducers. Audio path is thru pre-amp, compander, CODEC, and controller. Looks like it can support two elements, each with its own tunable preselector.
Large amount of 60 hz filtering, suspect they were originally designed for installation into power strips (APC, Best, Woods, etc).
Look for the low level multihump signature on the spectrum analyser, and take a REAL hard look at all surge protectors. Be sure to "box" all electrical artifacts encountered on a TSCM sweep.
Well engineered, suspect cost to manuf. is under $35, should be popular, most of the spy shops are selling these for $1500 to $3000.
More details to follow after the holiday, should have an update by that time regarding the VLF devices being built by Thompson, and E-Systems.

Several weeks ago I had a chance to examine a number of spread spectrum microwave bugging devices.
Since that time I've conducted some analysis and
gathered further intelligence on the circuit.
Here are a few of my observations.
=======  C O N F I D E N T I A L  ========
1) Most of the products use a high bandwidth QPSK/BPSK
modulator, multi channel audio CODEC, and a RISC
micro-controller chip (all components are either
surface mounted ICs or multiple dice potted in epoxy).
2) RF Circuit seems to be a simple homodyne audio
transmitter (6 Ghz Gilbert Cell Mixer) which is driven
by a single CPU/microcontroller (with a clock speed of 180 Mhz).
3) Frequencies used for the ultra low power device are
clean from 130 Mhz to 4 Ghz, circuit starts to fail
above 5.5 Ghz (but is still operable to about 8 Ghz).
4) Emitter is driven directly from vector modulator chip,
with no power amp circuits. PIN diode found on output
appears to provide gain control or disconnect of
circuit, but provides no amplification of signal.
5) Noise floor of circuit is -135 dBm (below 2 ghz),
-142 dBm (2-4 ghz), and -150 dBm above 4 Ghz.
6) Signal has a variable bandwidth which varies between
350 Mhz and 900 Mhz. Appears to be designed for a 900 Mhz bandwidth signal. Device operates "deep" inside the noise floor. 7) Virtually impossible to detect at close range with a
conventional RF spectrum analyzer (492/494/8566/etc).
8) Detectable with most wideband systems (with IF BW
above 300 - 900 Mhz, 700 Mhz ideal).
8) VCC = +3.0 VDC, all circuits functional 2.3 to 6.8 VDC
9) Output applied to PIN diode ranges between -28 and
-42 dBm (depending on frequency and span)
10)  Device enters some type of sleep mode when power
is present but audio level is low (seems to auto
squelch). Total current draw when in sleep mode is 12
µA. Device does not emit RF energy when in sleep mode.
11) One of the devices has no type of connection for
external power, but instead uses a uses a network of
Schottky diodes and capacitors which constitute an
effective RF to DC converter.
12) The RF to DC circuit requires an un-modulated 10-15
Ghz RF signal, and seems to respond well to X-Band
microwave motion detectors used for many corporate
alarm systems.
13) Device also has a small microphone built onto the
circuit, microphone measures 4.5mm * 1.6mm * 4.1mm.
14) Entire device measured 3.2 cm * 5.2 cm and about 3
mm thick (or about the thickness of a standard
business envelope).
15) Device contains some type of adhesive on both
sides of a foil backing. Suspect it's applied as some type
of "sticky label". Once the device is installed any attempt to remove results in its total destruction (unless you freeze it off).
16) The French government has been know to use a similar device in some of its "Diplomatic" activities.

TSCM-L Mailing List       Wednesday, August 30, 1997	    Volume 1997
I've been a bit busy over the last few weeks and have been unable to get TSCM-L out until this week.
Making good progress on the TSCM textbook, should have a draft copy available around the end of the year as planned.
Here is an extract of a DOE report regarding the various technical surveillance devices and other technical security problems found at DOE facilities within the United States recently.
Bugs Recently Found in U.S. Department of Energy Facilities
A telephone discovered in a DOE laboratory office was passing room audio while in the on-hook position. The phone was removed from the room by telephone maintenance personnel before an investigation could be initiated.
During a TSCM survey of an office site for a DOE Operations Office, (previously occupied by DOE contractor management), a technical surveillance device was discovered. Workers removing the suspended ceiling tiles discovered a clandestine hardwired installation above the ceiling.
A contractor employee that police arrested was sitting in an illegally parked van equipped with electronic eavesdropping equipment. The man was seen using earphones and monitoring activities in the area of three restricted DOE buildings.
A LLNL research assistant was discovered in a restricted area after hours. An investigation revealed that the employee was installing a wired microphone system into the office of a scientist. The installation consisted of several hundred feet of wire carefully concealed behind a carpet tack strip along the floor.
A telephone repairman removed the cover of a telephone set to adjust the ringer and noticed a microphone mounted on the interior base of the phone. After the cover was removed, he also noticed a diode next to the lug terminals on the network block. Tests conducted on the instrument demonstrated that with the diode on the network circuit board, the telephone passed good quality audio with the handset in the cradle. A similar telephone instrument was was also found that was passing very clear audio. This telephone was not connected to a line when discovered. There were no indications that classified discussions took place within the office identified.
Covert video cameras and microphones were found in a DOE womens shower and locker room area. An investigation revealed that video tapes from the cameras (of nude female employees) were being sold in local video rental stores in South Carolina. Investigators found that the recordings were being edited and sold by a DOE contractor employee. System was in place at least eight months.
Sensitive meeting information at a DOE facility conference room was being passed to unauthorized personnel, possibly by way of a manipulated telephone or a listening device. Evidence at the site indicated the possibility that a hardwired microphone or tape-recording device had been removed just prior to examination.
During a meeting with a DOE contractor employee, a Japanese national attempted to surreptitiously record the meeting. He was discovered with a body-worn tape recorder. The meeting, which was scheduled to cover reasons a specific Memorandum of Agreement was abruptly placed on hold.
A listening/recording device was discovered in a building at a DOE facility. The device was found in the administrative office of a shop manager, a contractor to the General Services Administration for DOE. The device was inappropriately removed by the office manager. Personnel involved in the discovery of the device thought it had been installed by a coworker who believed he was under investigation for possible theft of government property.
A DOE employee reportedly installed a telephone intercept device in a friend's apartment to determine if a privately owned countersurveillance detector was functioning properly. The device was hidden in the back of the living room couch located in front of the wall telephone jack. The DOE employee who resided in the apartment was unaware his friend had placed a device on the telephone line. He discovered the installation and immediately called the local police department, who responded and removed the device.
During an physical audit of a classified DOE Local Area Network a spread spectrum repeater was found which was passing classified data between two SRS buildings without any type of encryption. The device had been inappropriately installed by a DOE scientist 18 months prior to allow access to "his old LAN from his new office".
This material has been reviewed, and has been deemed not to contain any classified information, nor does it contain any SNSI/WNINTEL material.

@_subject: Fraud Alert - Frank Jones - Spyking 
I regret to inform you that you may have been the victim of a serious hoax
foisted by Frank Jones (aka: SpyKing).
Many people, including the members of the media, have been swallowing what
Frank Jones has to offer, simply because they neither understand the
science or won't do even simple research on a vendor (hint: the TEMPEST,
DATASCAN and similar products are an utter hoax).
You may be interested in the following information regarding Frank Jones
which we have listed on the Threat Profile Library.
We would encourage you to examine the materials in the Threat Profile
Library, and then to review your own dealings with the subject.
We also recommend that you carefully review the documents, and then contact
those agencies directly yourself (they would be happy to talk to you).
Each of the agencies (such as NY PI Lisc. Board, and NY Police Department)
will gladly provide you with authentication of the documents we present and
will gladly send you copies of the original documents (just ask them). They
will verify the documents are indeed genuine and were generated by their
agencies. Of course Frank claims that all of the documents in the library
have been forged and are counterfit (which is a hilarious claim).
Please feel free to verify the documents, in fact we strongly encourage it!!!
You may seriously want to reconsider your attendance at SpookTec98 as
several of the victims (and "Guest Speakers") who attended last year were
not at all amused (some of whom where burned when their promised "limo and
free hotel room" never showed up).
Good Luck,

A telephone eavesdropping system was recently encountered which is being sold by a company in Pomezia, Italy. The system is for use on AT&T System 25, 75, and 85 PBX systems (other versions are available for 1030, 3070, Merlin, and Partner systems).
The first element of the system consists of a station card which has been built from scratch and appears almost identical to the original cards built by AT&T. There are no modifications on the card, and all components appear legitimate
The only visual difference between the cards is several additional integrated circuits, and discrete components. Additionally, on the silkscreen side of the card is a small logo consisting of an upper case letter E followed by a 7xx type of number (such as E-728). The logo will appear diagonally across the card from the serial number. Each station card will support 8 digital phones, and one outgoing circuit.
The second element of the system is the printed circuit board that goes into the actual telephone. Much like the station card the printed circuit board appears original but closer inspection will reveal a small number of extra components and PCB traces which go to the four pair position.
Suspect telephones will present an anomaly on the power and/or 4th pair. The signal is a digital data signal (usually 160 Kbps). Vector signal analysis will indicate a QAM/BPQSK cats-eye (a digital audio signal via a seven stage parasitic polynomial 1+x6+x7 algorithm). Waveform is a serial data stream, bipolar signal at roughly 700mV (680-715 mV depending on instrument). Power drain is fairly high (average of 136% over normal), but station card will not indicate an over-current condition or station error. Serial data stream is constant, and only affected by application of power. Signal stops if power is removed for more than 15 milliseconds. Disconnection of handset does not effect signal. Signal is present in both on-hook and off-hook conditions.
The third element of the system is a small modification to the PBX back plane which consists of two small wires which are tacked into place between the station card and the line card. This bridging circuit allows a T-Carrier signal to pass from the station card to an unused cable pair for an outgoing signal path (usually the 25th pair). This modification will appear to be a legitimate factory modification to the The fourth element of the system is the transmission path back to the listening post (which will appear to be a T-1 signal, but will only use one cable pair). A RF transmitter could be used, however; such an emission would increase the possibility of the system being detected if used inside or near the target facility. A RF transmitter could be used once the signal is well outside the facility.
The transmission path will normally consist of a T-Carrier signal that can be traced to a facility demarcation point and then to an external cable pair. The signal will typically terminate at (or just prior to) an off-site SLC box. At this point the T-Carrier signal will be bridged back to a listening post either by hardwiring or an RF transmitter (though the use of a bridging capacitor to isolate the DC components of the circuit).
Faked power outages in the PBX or server room will typically be used to cover the installation activities. The installation consists of swapping the station card, and then installing the jumper wires on the back plane. While the power is still off the special printed circuit boards are installed into the target phones. Optionally, the telephone may simply be swapped with an instrument that has been modified in advance. Power is then restored with the event being logged as a short power outage (usually during bad weather or construction work).
French Magistrate Targets Official Wiretapper
PARIS, May 28 (Reuters) - A man who headed France's official wiretap
unit has been placed under investigation in connection with illegal
eavesdropping carried out on orders of the late President Francois
Mitterrand's office, judicial sources said on Thursday.
Army Brigadier General Pierre Charroy, 63, was ordered placed under
investigation for complicity in invasion of privacy in his capacity as
head of the discreetly named Interministerial Control Group (GIC) under
Mitterrand, the sources said.
The GIC is officially entrusted with carrying out wiretaps on the orders
of magistrates in cases of espionage or serious crimes. The body is so
shrouded with secrecy that it is not known if Charroy still heads it.
Former Mitterrand aides acknowledged last year that the late president,
who ruled from 1981-1995, had ordered security officers attached to his
office to carry out illegal wiretaps on the telephone lines of lawyers,
journalists, politicians and at least one movie actress.
The justice sources said magistrate Jean-Paul Vallat suspected Charroy
of having aided the presidential wiretappers who acted without the
permission of magistrates, making their actions illegal.
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin pledged in last year's general election
campaign to end an era of "monarchical secrecy" if he came to power and
to lift the lid on cases like possible illegal wiretapping under
Mitterrand, with whom Jospin was on poor terms.
Jospin has since been accused of dragging his feet on the promise since
he became prime minister and judge Vallat has written to ask for his
help in his probes.
Some 15 former Mitterrand aides are under investigation and could face
possible trial in the case.
Mitterrand died in 1996, seven months after leaving office.
