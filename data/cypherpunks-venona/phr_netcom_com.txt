@_subject: ride to crypto 94 (santa barbara) available 
The person who I planned to drive with made other arrangements.
Anyone interested, send mail to phr ASAP, or phone
510-843-8236.  Leaving Berkeley preferably Sunday midday,
but flexible about departure time and route.  Probably going
to take 101 all the way down for speed, but might be willing
to take highway 1 back for the view.

@_subject: sci.crypt archive? 
Is anyone on cypherpunks archiving sci.crypt?  I'd be interested
in getting hold of some articles from some years back... thanks
