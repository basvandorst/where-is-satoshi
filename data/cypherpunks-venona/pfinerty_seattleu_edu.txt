-warning banner deleted-
this is a mesg that appeared in the may/june 1993 InfoSECURITY NEWS "Legal Beat" column.  it is supposedly recommended by the U.S. Justice Department to avoid violation of the ECPA.
i got this info from the docs that came with UltraSHIELD, a security program for Macintoshes.
the warning also 'showed up' one day on this acct which i found a bit disturbing but then realized where it came from after getting the mac security program.
oh, i suppose i should say who the hell i am. my name is patrick finerty.  i'm a fourth year grad student in biochemisty at the university of utah.  this is an alum acct i have through seattle university and i can also be reached at the accts below.

@_subject: Re: PGP for VMS 
i have successfully compiled pgp2.6.2, pgp2.5, pgp2.6.1 etc on a VAX.  there are some modifications that usually need to be made when building rsaref (modifications to the rsabuild.com file i believe) that simply comment out a couple lines that are not required to build pgp but that are required to build the whole rsaref library.
i think the important lines to remove or comment out with a '!' are
$ call compile md2c
$ call compile md5c
please write if you need more assistance than this.

@_subject: dr. dobbs - where? 
i'd like to know where i can find dr. dobbs.  i came up with a lot of stuff
(52 hits actually) using gopher but i'd prefer some sort of mailing list or
even better, a WWW page for it.  of course, if there is a std ftp site i'd go
for that as well.  basically, i'm easy to please.  i just want to read the
crypto articles mention by bruce.
life, you see, is not meant to be enjoyed.

@_subject: VAX pgp uploaded to the cypherpunks site. 
i have uploaded pgp compiled for a VAX running VAX/VMS to the cypherpunks ftp site.  here is a copy of the readme file i included with it.  i should note that the reason i did this was primarily to provide pgp to people who do not have access to c compilers or a PC/DOS machine.  this is, of course, not meant to substitute for checking the source and compiling pgp yourself.
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
VAXPGP262.TAR.Z is a compressed tar file containing the following docs.  NOTE!! - this is _not_ a complete pgp distribution.  only the following files are included!

i was able to get to hks.lists.cypherpunks group quite easily using NCSA Mosaic.  i set my news server to nntp.hks.net and then told Mosaic to go to a URL with this format, news:hks.lists.cypherpunks  surprisingly, this worked quite well.

you need to enter the proxy address in your preferences.  this is not a site to http to.
in your prefs there is a section on proxies.  put the address and port number in there.  this is already set for NSCA Mosaic, all you have to do is click on the button next to USE CERN PROXY SERVICE.  for netscape, just enter  in the http proxy section and 911 as the port number.
