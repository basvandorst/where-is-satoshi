Could anyone direct me to some other mailing lists dealing with either computer security or current communication technology, routers,modems etc.  Thank you ahead of time.  Also could anyone direct me to some good beginner books on cryptography of computer security. When referring books could you make them recent so that they would be regularly available at Barnes&Noble or Borders.

@_subject: Internet Information 
Iwas wondering if anyone could pint me to a DETAILED description of the internet routing system.  Basically how a message gets from my computer to another lets say in Europe.  No need for simplicity I would like a real description.  Dont worry abpout protocols just where my message goes.  Also does anyone have a list of where the net's routers are located and who runs them.  Also their respective routing speeds at the current times.
Thank You ahead of time!
