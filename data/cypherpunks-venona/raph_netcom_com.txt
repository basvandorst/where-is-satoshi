@_subject: Premail and transparent email 
It's quite gratifying to see that people are actually using premail
and like it.
I see premail as a prototype for _real_ transparent email encryption.
A lot of people are intimidated by the need to get premail off the ftp
site, unzip/untar it, and set all the configuration variables to get
it running right. This "intimidation factor," of course, only applies
to *x people. Everybody else is completely out of luck.
I think the same problems hold with most of the scripts that are out
there. Every time I've gotten something to play with, I've had to
diddle with pathnames, or the makefile, or whatever.
The real solution, I think, is to get all the needed components for
transparent email encryption into the standard releases of the tools.
I'm currently working on exactly this project.
In rough outline, PGP will run as a "server" process. Mailers would
connect to the server, and pass all incoming and outgoing mail through
it. One advantage is that clients would contain _no_ crypto content,
so there would be no problems with exportability. The server would
contain much of the functionality of premail. I showed an early
prototype at the last cpunks meeting.
Initially, I am doing all the work in *x, just because that's what I
have tools for, but ultimately it should work for Windows and Mac as
My intent is to get large numbers of people to use PGP to encrypt all
of their email, including casual stuff. This won't happen until
encryption and decryption are _totally_ transparent.

@_subject: Re: Brands excluded from digicash beta 
I also have had no luck getting a beta client from digicash. I
"registered" through their WWW forms page, and got no response for
about a month. Then they sent me mail saying that they would be
sending a client, but that they were unrolling it in stages. That was
about a month ago. Perhaps this means I will get my client soon.
This does not speak well for digicash. If they were not ready to beta
their stuff, they should not have announced it. As it is, it makes
them look like a flake.
BTW, I am beginning to amass NexusBucks. I would _really_ like to buy
something with them, just to prove their viability. They are
exchangable 1-for-1 for US$, but only in terms of services on Sameer's
system. If anyone has a t-shirt or somehting similar that they'd like
to sell, please let me know.
Perhaps we should make the Cypherpunks motto a bit less ambitious.

@_subject: PGP MIME type (was Well now that we're signing...) 
Where? Which RFC?
I just checked the IANA media-types directory (at
ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types), and there
was no PGP type listed. I also searched through recent RFC titles, and
found nothing appropriate.
There is of course a draft by Nat Borenstein et al, but it is not an
official RFC yet. Therefore, it is not valid MIME. Last I heard, it
was taking a fairly low priority. The draft doesn't address the fact
that a clearsigned message is readable text, and therefore should be
text/pgp rather than application/pgp. He is planning to fix this.
My premail software generates the application/x-pgp type, which _is_
valid MIME. So is text/x-pgp, which I don't support yet because
premail 0.30 doesn't do clearsigning (hopefully, the next release
will). I am eager to switch to the official MIME type as soon as it is
If anyone knows better, please let me know.

@_subject: Time to exhaustively break 40-bit RC4? 
The SSL documents say that exhaustively searching 40 bits of RC4
keyspace takes 64 MIPS-years. When I brought this figure up at the
cpunks meeting, it was roundly derided. However, I think it might be a
sound estimate.
The key schedule operation in RC4 does 256 "swap" operations. Let's
say it takes four instructions to do each swap. So, it's 2000
instructions per key. A one-MIPS processor can search 500 keys a
second. There are about 30 million seconds in a year, so that's 15
billion keys a year. 40 bits is a trillion keys, so it works out to 66
years, which is well within the Pentium-style accuracy of the
calculations I've done.
Am I missing something here?
On the second floor of Soda Hall are about 100 HP Snake
workstatations. I think they're about 100 MIPS each. During the winter
break, they will be sitting mostly unused. If the math checks out,
they should be able to search keyspace in two and a half days. Anyone
wanna do some cracking?

@_subject: Re: Time to exhaustively break 40-bit RC4? 
This doesn't quite work. As I understand it, the RC4 key scheduling
algorithm repeats the key to fill 256 bytes. For a 128-bit key, this
is 16 times. Thus, you can only win on the last repeat. Perry also
mentioned some "optimizations" but I believe RC4 is resistant to this
sort of thing. The inner loop is about as simple as you're going to
get it.
Oh, just to clarify one point. 40-bit RC4 in fact uses a 128 bit key,
it's just that 88 bits of the key are sent in the clear.
Your idea does help in searching the 128-bit keyspace. Unfortunately,
it reduces the time needed from about 10^45 to 10^43 operations. Mazel

@_subject: More 40-bit RC4 nonsense 
If I recall correctly, the first byte out of the RC4 stream has
about a 40% chance of being the first byte of the key. Thus, if the
40-bit "secret" part of the key is the _beginning_ of the full 128-bit
key, then the keyspace is effectively reduced by about seven bits,
meaning that I would be able to crack a key on my PC in a couple of
days or so.
   Of course, if the "clear" 88 bits went first, there would be no
advantage whatsoever. The SSL document very carefully does not say
how they combine the two key parts to form the 128-bit key. Does
anyone know?

@_author: Raph Levien 
@_subject: Re: More 40-bit RC4 nonsense 
Wrong. It _is_ true that the first byte of the key has a 40%
probability of being the first byte of the initial state vector. It is
_not_ true that the first byte of the initial state vector is the
first byte out of the RC4 stream. Next time I will check the (alleged)
source code before making a fool of myself.
Thus, my attack shortcut will not work.
Kipp Hickman informs me that the salt is concatenated with the secret
part in such a way that the secret portion is least significant. This
seems wise because of the key/statevector characteristic, but wouldn't
make too much difference either way in practice.
Sorry for the confusion.

I just got off the phone with Peter Lewis, reporter for the New

but then again if there was one, I don't think they'd tell him.
   His piece that ran Saturday was badly mangled by the editorial
process, especially since it ran on page one. Those articles get to be
mangled by a whole new set of people who otherwise wouldn't get to
touch it. I think Lewis has basically good intentions, and does do his
homework before writing a story.
   Yecchh. Now I know why I don't rely on daily newspapers for my news
(the Internet keeps me up on the fast-breaking stuff, and the
Economist fills me in on the rest). The fact that most people rely
papers and the even worse TV news does not bode well.
   Martha Siegel is just fucked up enough that she will probably push
for legislation regulating the nets. Congress is just fucked up that
they might pass it.

@_subject: Draft of editorial to SF Chronicle 
Chaos and Anonymity keep the Internet Vital
I could not let Martha Siegel's editorial ("Anarchy, Chaos on the
Internet Must End", 2 Jan 1995) go unchallenged. To the uninformed
reader, her arguments may seem plausible. However, her distortions
give a picture of the Internet quite at odds with the true nature of
the Net. Her views are by no means representative of those who
actually use the Net. Of the dozens of messages I saw in response to
the editorial, not a single one was in favor of her proposals.
As Ms. Siegel correctly points out, the Net is not governed by any one
individual person or organization. Rather, it is collectively run by
those who use it as part of their daily lives. The operation of each
Internet node is subject to the individual judgement of the people who
own it. Ms. Siegel is wrong, however, in believeing that such a state
of affairs is intolerable. Rather, this state of affairs has brough us
a remarkable flowering of discourse, ideas and culture, which is just
now beginning to be recognized in the mainstream press.
In a lawyer's dream world, there is a rule covering every action in
every situation, along with a well-functioning system to enforce the
rules. This is the exact opposite of the spirit of the Net, and of
Usenet in particular. Rather, there has evolved an informal set of
guidelines for promoting open, civil discourse, collectively known as
"netiquette." These guidelines may seem arcane to newcomers, but
basically they simply ask people who use the Net to be considerate of
other people, their time and their resources. A violation of
netiquette brings on not legal action, but responses pointing out why
the action was inconsiderate. Continued violation brings on ridicule
and scorn -- people who engage in this are considered to be either
sociopathic or just obnoxiously self-promoting.
The single most infamous breach of netiquette in Usenet history was
almost certainly the "green card spam," in which thousands of
advertisements for green card services were posted to completely
unrelated message areas, or "newsgroups." Advertisements presented in
a way considerate to others are tolerated and even welcomed on the
Net. Posting thousands of copies, though, is just going too far.
Negative response was immediate. The perpetrators were asked to stop,
but they refused to. One Norwegian hacker took it upon himself to
track down and "cancel" the offending messages. Most people on the Net
considered this to be entirely appropriate.
A number of other self-promoting hucksters have sensed an opportunity,
and have performed similar spams. In response, the Net evolved a
defense mechanism to counter these spams and minimize the damage. The
person currently serving this role is known by the pseudonym
"CancelMoose." Almost everyone on the Net supports this effort, and
agrees that it improves the overall value of Usenet.
Who was responsible for the original green card spam? Why, Ms. Siegel
herself, the same one who is complaining about "chaos and anarchy."
Chaos, anarchy, and anonymity are a large part of what keeps the Net
so vital.
Particularly galling is Ms. Siegel's appeal to free speech. Usenet in
its present form is perhaps the most conducive forum for free speech
in history. The threat to free speech is not from chaos or anonymity,
but from the sorts of changes that Ms. Siegel proposes.
Usenet is astonishingly effective in getting around the practical
barriers to free speech. These barriers come in many forms, including
libel, trademark, and copyright laws, fear of retribution, etc.
Because of its decentralized, communal nature, Usenet resists direct
attempts to censor. The main tool for circumventing more these more
indirect barriers is anonymity.
As an example of such barriers, take the t-shirt commemorating the
green card incident. It was emblazoned with the words, "Green Card
Lawyers - Spamming the Globe" and a fist clutching a green card.
Shortly after the shirt was proposed, Canter & Siegel threatened to
sue if the shirt was in fact produced. It was only after several
outraged lawyers promised to defend against such a case pro bono that
I and others could be proud owners.
Or take one of the sexual abuse recovery newsgroups, where anonymity
is the norm. If someone were to post a message asking for support,
saying "my uncle did it" under their real name, they would be
vulnerable to a libel suit from said uncle. On the other hand, if they
used an anonymous service such as the one in Finland, they would not
simply escape punishment for the libel, but prevent it from happening
at all.
In many countries (and even China is on the Net these days), writings
critical of the government, such as exposure of human rights abuses,
are illegal. The authors face imprisonment, torture and death. By
posting anonymously to the Net, the information can be brought safely
to the attention of the world.
Not all anonymous messages are pleasant or popular. Unpopular speech
is a necessary consequence of free speech. At least to the founders of
this country, the benefits of free speech outweigh the discomfort. Our
founding fathers were also comfortable with anonymity -- the
Federalist papers were originally published under the pseudonym
Publius, because the authors felt the ideas should be evaluated on
their own.
Judging from the materials already published by Ms. Siegel, an
Internet built according to her vision would free of such disturbing
ideas, but would readily support five hundred channels of green card
ads, impassioned pleas to purchase American flag plaques, and, yes,
anonymous testimonials for radial keratotomy specialists.
