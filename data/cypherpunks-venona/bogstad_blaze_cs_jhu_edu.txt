write-only media the default state of a bit is X and you write by changing
some of the bits to Y.  This being the case, you could conceivably zap part
of the disk by writting them as all Ys.  This would require everyone to have
a CD-ROM writer not just a reader.  Another problem is even if the media
itself has this capability the standard writer devices are going to want to
write block checksums etc.; which is probably going to fail.
