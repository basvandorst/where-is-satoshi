This is a good idea - certainly a nice way to emphasize (sp) signing posts. Having majordomo verify signatures automatically and add message content if either (as sandy suggests) signature is missing or bad.
One question would be whether majordomo should add content upon verification of a signature, or upon failure to verify a signature (missing or bad). Depends on which would have most 'positive' appearance, and (more importantly) would generate least extra volume in the long term. Personally I think that flagging the messages with bad or missing signatures is a better idea - as more people sign articles on the list there will be less flagging volume sent out by md.
Nice idea Sandy.
... only snag is that md has to be modified again. Has Eric the time and desire to fit this in. I can't help with the perl - still not grokked it   Jonathon Fletcher
