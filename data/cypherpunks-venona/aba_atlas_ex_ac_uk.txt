Not sure that would be a good idea, then the news group would *be*
cypherpunks, and the cypherpunks list would have effectively become a
USENET newsgroup (albiet with some mail2news stuff behind).  For me
part of the fun of cypherpunks is that things get discussed here which
don't get discussed anywhere else, things happen here 1st, rc4 leak,
that kind of thing, if it's happening crypto wise, it's on
You might lose some of the community feel to it if it was gated
straight to a USENET group, I mean at that point the majordomo list
server would have become a news2mail gateway.
I was thinking more that you would have a separate newsgroup, but
perhaps my feelings are more of the elitist stuff Peter was referring
to, still I see no need to change a good thing, can't the two co-exist
separately, Peter's stated aims didn't co-incide with my perception of
the cypherpunks lists goals.  ie the list (modulo cpunks write code
wars) seems to me to be about people who share the common goal of free
crypto for everyone, discussing how to go about this, writing code to
help it happen, and analysis of what the government is up to where it
infringes on cypherpunk goals.  I think Peter's goals sounded more
amenable to a forum which was a) easily accessible, and b) had a
stated aim of a kind of cypherpunk technology transfer forum.
Perhaps I am being eliteist, so shoot me, but I like cypherpunks the
list the way it is!
For your convenience reading cpunks there are a couple of solutions to
the deluge of mail problem: there used to be a nntp server at
nntp.hks.net which nntp served cypherpunks as a newsgroup (I haven't
used this in a while as it appeared to be down or empty or somthing
for a while), there are filters which you can set up to put all cpunks
traffic in a separate mbox, and there are a couple of digest forms of
cpunks around also.  The filter won't help your down load time, the
digest (I think Hal offers / was offering an encrypted digest which
would also be compressed) and the nntp server might.
Me, I quite like the cypherpunk name, I reckon it would be best from a
distribution pov to get a big8 group, as you discuss.
I'll let other people argue about newsgroups names.

@_subject: Re: CJR returned to sender 
On the T-shirt which some poeple are starting to view as an overplayed
I'd agree that we on cypherpunks have probably heard enough on the
subject, to the extent that it was creating a lot of noise a while
back, but the idea I think is to create publicity wherein ITAR is
ridiculed by demonstrating that the State Departments ITAR related
decisions are inconsistent, and arbitrary.
This I think is a similar tactic to that used by Phil Karn, with the
Applied Crypto case, and by MIT with the MIT PGP source code book and
CJR on that.
Also the SSL 88+40 brute force was mostly a political demonstration,
most anyone could have predicted the approximate MIPs required, and
that it was ridiculously weak.  Yet much of the media attention widely
ignored the fact that it was a simple fact, 40 bits isn't enough, and
chose instead to play on wording such as "French Student Hacker breaks
Netscape", which of course is wildly inaccurate on numerous counts.
As to the accusation that a T-shirt is silly, sure, I absolutely
agree, but it's *supposed to be* silly, the point being to get a
decision from the state department, and say, look the decisions these
people are making with extreme weight of law ($1,000,000 fines &c) are
ridiculously inconsistent, and arbitrary, and cost the US software
industry 100s of millions of dollars each year in lost trade.  With a
silly example, I would have thought you would be more likely to get
positive editorials from the press.  I mean if you say PGP, some
people are sucked in by the crypto scare stories Freeh and co put out.
If it's a T-shirt you'd have a hard time saying it was a dangerous
item, or that the info was dangerous.
If unclear fabric printing is the issue, put it on a floppy disk
(would take less than one sector), print the program on the disk label
and try that too.  Also my uk printed shirts, and Don Henson's (other
US supplier) have a simply huge barcode (Joel's is around 1/2 the
size) the aim being to remove all doubt about readability.  See
pictures (mine (UK), and Don's (US) respectively):
You could probably transcribe that barcode by hand the stripes are
that fat.  The ITAR docs themselves don't seem to make the case that
machine readability is significant, that was to my understanding just
an arbitrary decision they displayed with Phil Karn's Applied Crypto
disk set.  No to the disks due to being more machine readable than the
book, or something.  The reason for the barcode was to try to
encourage banning of the T-shirt by pandering to thier apparent
prediliction to ban machine readable forms of things freely available
in print form.
On the "has been declared a munition by State Department", this is
clearly incorrect.  Don Henson used this in his earlier ads, and I
corrected him on this wording, and he now says something different.
The wording on the shirt (Joel Furr's shirt which is what Raph mailed
I understand) the caption is:
and you can see a picture of this shirt it, here:
I don't think saying this shirt is a munition is that misleading.  It
is arguable, and of course no decision has been obtained from the
State Department, but if anyone is so sure about it I'd invite them to
make a public demonstration of exporting it in any medium they fancy
(paper, disk, internet, T-shirt).  Another candidate: export snuffle
without asking permission.  I hear that it is only 10 lines of C code.

The "has been classified" was wording that Don Henson used in his

If you haven't, you should read Doug Barnes recent postings on the current state of money laundering regulations.
Chilling stuff.  You can bet they are not going to like the payment
system you described, it's it's methods of transfering funds to and
from US bank accounts would be open to many of the anti-money
laundering attacks.
It would put a lot of strain on the remailer nets to have the likes of
FinCen, FBI, CIA, NSA etc. after them.  It is the legal impliciations
which are the problem, if they don't like what you are doing, and can
hold that it is illegal, they will come after you with excessive
Even it you could get away with it, a purely anarchistic system has
the disadvantage of lack of take up: if no one is accepting your
e-cash, you can't buy things with it.  It could be made illegal for
people to accept your e-cash, at this point only people acting
anonymously will be using it.  I think a possible approach is to work in two stages: to first work
towards wide use of ecash, as privacy preserving as feasible with
government imposed restrictions, and then in the future work on
improving the level of privacy.
The two stage approach I think is more likely to succeed because while
there is no payment infrastructure, the hard-line blacknet style
operations run counter to the aim of speeding the uptake of ecash.
It seems to me that payment systems that escape jurisdictions by being
in cyberspace protected by strong crypto, whilst perhaps inevitable
long term, are still some way off.
I think it is useful to explore what could be achieved by getting
something less abitious working first.
I like the distributed anarchic approach too, but lets first find
peoples opinions on what is possible within the system, and see if
anything useful would be possible with these constraints.  I would like to hear views on whether the best that can be achieved
with such constraints would be a step in the direction of a more
desirable system (with better privacy guarantees), or whether it would
instead be detrimental to the cause, say perhaps by contributing to
getting a non-privacy preserving scheme immovably fixed as a standard.
There are several approaches to ecash systems that I am aware of:
1. no anonymity - most current systems
2. "trust me" the schemes which claim anonymity, but in reality rely
   on your trust in the bank. eg Mondex
3. clipper-cash (Jakobsson) here you get to trust a (supposedly
   independant) third party
4. blind signatures (Chaum, Brands)
5. or agnostic server (Doug's paper)
   (blinding as well, just avoiding Chaum's patents)
6. anarchy - remailer net, blacknet type operation
I would discount 1 & 2 as outright undesirable, and already available
anyway.  6 would cause the regulators to throw a fit.
Of the remainder 3, 4 & 5, I think the most likely to be acceptable to
regulators is 4: clipper-cash.  Next come 4 & 5.  Chaum's blinding,
and Doug's agnostically blinding proposals.
What do people think of clipper-cash?
Basically it sets of a scheme where you have an ombudsman who is
supposed to be acting on the consumers behalf.  Revoking privacy
requires the cooperation of both the bank and the ombudsman - the bank
on it's own can't strip your privacy.
Down side: to get such a scheme past regulators the ombudsman would
probably end up being a government body, or one beholden to
government, such as banks are with all the current banking regs, re
Doug's last two posts on the subject.
The problem with clipper-cash see is that it is just as the name
implies: private until you are investigated, or until the regulators
decide to go on a fishing spree.  But better than no anonymity.
Technologically it would be possible to have multiple ombudsmen, or
even have the recovery key be secret share split amongst ecash users
in such a way that some chosen percentage of agreement would be
required before cash could be traced, or revoked (made worthless).
I would presume that the more ombudsmen there are, and the less
amenable they are to government pressures, the less likely the payment
scheme would be to be acceptable to the banking regulators.
Does clipper cash satisfy any cypherpunk goals?  Or is it the ecash
equivalent of the hated clipper, and clipper II initiatives?
A blinding agnostic or openly blinding signature based server would
obviously be preferable, but could you get such a system approved by
the regulators?
These are just questions, to see what people think are the optimal
configurations from a cypherpunks perspective, and how close to these
ideals a payment system could be and still get past the regulators.

Having your company legally based outside the US, with just a US
office (on paper) would seem to get around this.  If all your code is
shipped from Sun Corp, Russia (and actually you get CDs in the mail
from Russia literally if you order software from them), then it would
seem to avoid the problem.  They'd probably have to make sure that no
programming at all occured in the US otherwise they'd be susceptible
to the claim that they were violating ITAR by their US development
team exporting software with a hole for crypto to their main
development team in Russia.
Multinationals could juggle that much easily.
The other problem is that multi-nationals don't like stepping on the
govts toes, because the govt might retaliate by not buying Sun, or Sun
mysteriously losing contracts.  Sound right?
However this is the real problem, the don't want crypto no matter
what.  They'll do their damnest to stop it by whatever means: legal or
illegal, monetary pressure, threats, FUD, overbroad ITAR, selective
enforcement, etc.
Something that is puzzling me is how DigiCash is doing.  Their
software I think is ITAR regulated (or would be if it were shipped
from a US ftp site).  OK, so they get around it by shipping their
software from Digicash, Bv, Netherlands.
But, somewhere on their pages it mentions that: "Digicash, Bv is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Digicash" (which *is* based in the US).
Does that make them a counter example who is currently getting away
with it?  Just to complicate things further David Chaum is a US
citizen, right?  Maybe he himself is ok because he doesn't write the
code himself, the digicash development team does.  Is Digicash (US)
hiring (collectively) Digicash, Bv if it is a wholly owned subsidiary,
in US legal terms?
Reckon the long term message is for companies to just pull out of the
US.  Moving to a suitable jurisdiction would be possible for Netscape,
and would be a coool blow against ITAR.

Note it says _technically_ above, as there was much discussion on the

classified as a munition due to the impracticality of using a shirt as
a distribution media, and silliness factor.  We shall see wrt the
shirt when and if Raph recieves a determination from his CJR for the
shirt.  (I would note that someone posted a while ago that they did
manage to get the barcode to scan, on I think one of Joel Furr's

stipulates that a software item can be shown to a foreign national in
the US seems open to debate (some say ITAR strictly interpreted does
say this, others say not).

opener for me was that I took a look at Phil Karn's export page to do
with his ongoing battle against ITAR as applied to crypto, with the
Applied Crypto disk/book case:

       enforcing ITAR.  They consult with the NSA, the NSA has the
       last word on what gets export approval.
1    History of crypto as it applies to PGP
1.1  The year is 1976 a cryptographer, and privacy advocate named
     Whitfield Diffie, together with mathematician named Martin Hellman
     discovers public key cryptography.  (DH key exchange is still a
     commonly used key exchange protocol -- DH = Diffie-Hellman).
1.2  1977 Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman discover another more
     general public key system called RSA (after surnames Rivest,
     Shamir, and Adleman).  R, S & A were researchers at MIT
     (significant later, because MIT had part ownership of patents.)
1.3  NSA tells MIT and R, S & A that they'd better not publish this or else.
1.4  Amusingly Adi Shamir (A from RSA) isn't even a US citizen, he's an
     Israeli national, and is now back in Israel at the Technicon (is
     he, anyone know his current affiliation?)  Who knows what the NSA
     would have done about him if they had succeeded in supressing RSA
     - not allowed him out of the US?
1.5  MIT and R, S & A ignore NSA and publish anyway in SciAm July
     1977. Comms ACM (feb 1978, vol 21, no 2, pp 120-126 in case      you want to see if it's in your library - it's in Exeter Univ
     (UK) library).
1.6  Because the publication was a rush job due to the NSA, R,S & A
     and the later formed PKP and RSADSI lose patent rights
     to RSA crypto outside the US.  This is because most places
     outside the US, you have to obtain a patent *before*
     publication, where as in the US, you have one year from the
     publication date to file for patents.  This also had implications for
     PGP later
1.7  IDEA was developed by Xuejia Lai and James Massey at ETH in Zurich.
     (Relevant to PGP because IDEA is the symmetric key cipher used
     together with RSA in PGP).  Also crypto politics relevance in
     that it is another (of many) examples of the fact that crypto
     knowledge and expertise is worldwide, ie why export restrict
     something which is available both sides of the ITAR fence, or
     even originated *outside* it?  (Strangely, ITAR applies to
     importing and then re-exporting a crypto system, even if no
     modifications are made).  There are lots of other symmetric key
     ciphers, IDEA is one with a good reputation (no known practical
     attacks better than brute-force to date, and a good key size), and
     is just referenced here because of its use in PGP.
(some years pass...)
2    Birth of PGP
2.1  PRZ wrote PGP
2.2  PRZ gave PGP to some friends
2.3  some friends up loaded onto a few bulletin boards (US only)
     One friend (allegedly Kelly Goen) went around pay-phones with a
     portable, an acoustic coupler, and a list of BBS phone numbers
     uploading and then driving on to another area.  This cloak and
     dagger stuff was because at the time the USG had some draconian
     sounding proposed law on the books which sounded like it was
     going to outlaw crypto.  The intention was to ensure that PGP was
     available before this law came into effect, and to avoid being
     stopped if the USG took interest.
2.4  somehow PGP leaked outside the US via the internet.  Information
     wants to be free, as someone said: `trying to control the free
     flow of information on the internet is like trying to plug a
     sieve with a hole in it'.  Also Tim May's quote 'National borders are
     just speedbumps on the information superhighway' expresses the
     point very nicely.
2.5  people all over the world (yeah outside the US too) start using PGP
2.6  RSA complains to PRZ that PGP violates their PK patents
2.7  PRZ tells RSA to get stuffed, says its the users problem to get a license
2.8  PGP is considered potentially patent infringing because of 2.6
2.9  Illegality taint increases the spread of PGP, generates news, more
     people get a copy to see what the fuss is about
(some time passes, PGP gets real popular...)
3    USG decides they don't like PRZ
3.1  US govt decides that they don't like PRZ because the NSA can't
     tap all those internet mail messages anymore.  (the NSA part is
     speculation, but in my opinion likely true).
3.2  US govt begins investigating PRZ for alleged aiding with ITAR
     violation.
3.3  Phil Zimmermann legal defense fund set up to cover his legal
     expenses
3.4  still on going...
4    PRZ, MIT and RSA sort out earlier patent issues
4.1  MIT and PRZ work with RSA to sort out patent issue.
4.2  A solution is obtained in that RSA agree that PGP can use RSA
     provided that their RSAREF library is used.
4.3  PGP2.5 is written which uses RSAREF in place of MPILIB (also
     has backwards compatibility with older versions impaired to discourage      use of older allegedly patent infringing versions - to keep RSA happy)
4.4  RSAREF may be slower, but at least with some negotiating by PRZ
     and MIT, PGP is now 100% legal in the US
4.5  MIT begins acting as official US distributor of PGP
4.6  As usual, a few milli-seconds (well okay, minutes) after the
     official release of a new version of PGP, it gets exported from
     the US.
4.7  The deal with RSA over RSAREF has fixed the patent related
     problems in the US, but it has created a copyright related
     problem outside the US, (recall 0.6).  RSAREF is a software
     package copyrighted by RSA, and RSA is not allowed to export it
     because of ITAR, and their license agreement says as much (ie it
     says that you must not export it, and if you do export, you, and
     the subsequent users of it, are in breach of license).  It is
     therefore supposed that RSA could if they wanted complain about
     this (who knows that they would want to, or what conceivable
     benefit it would give them if they did).  This isn't enough to
     bother most people, but commercial users, and big organisations
     have lawyers, and are wary of such things.
4.8  Staale Schaumaker put together pgp26i to avoid this problem.  Main
     difference between pgp26x and pgp26xi is that pgp26xi uses PRZs
     original big integer library MPILIB, which is any case faster than
     RSADSI's RSAREF, and the lack of the legal kludge noted in 3.3.
5    Current legal status
5.1  PGP is legal both inside and outside the US.  You just need to use
     pgp26 versions inside the US, and pgp26xi versions outside the US.
5.2  In the US if you are using PGP in a commercial setting, and care
     about patents, you should purchase a copy of ViaCrypt pgp2.7
5.3 Commercial use outside the US: RSA is free, in the PGP docs (pgp262i
    & pgp262) Ascom-Tech are quoted as saying that currently no license     is required for commercial use of PGP outside the US as far as they
    are concerned.  Ascom-Tech are the patent holders of IDEA (see
    1.7), the symmetric crypto system used by PGP.
6    ITARs viewed from inside the US
6.1  ITAR means that if you are in the US you should not export PGP.
     (Yeah it's already available on a few thousand ftp sites around the
     free world, so another export isn't going to make any difference, but
     the NSA and the ODTC might not see it in that light).
6.2  Even though controlling the export of freeware software available
     worldwide might seem incredibly stupid (not to mention
     pointless), you should bear in mind that the penalties for
     getting successfully prosecuted for violating ITAR are rather
     steep.  Up to $1,000,000 (US$) fine, and and up to10 years
     imprisonment per count of export.
6.3  They'd probably never do anything to you, PRZ is just a scape goat
     (someone they can symbolically persecute to discourage others).
     I have personally seen several people from US sites post crypto

No need for any new laws or regulations, all that needs to be done is
to add crypto to the import list (the opposite, and currently not so
widely discussed counter part to the export list).
In fact I wouldn't be suprised if the ODTC and NSA could interpret
ITAR and the current import list to allow this.  (Anyone have an
electronic copy of the import restricted list?)
Of course this wouldn't be a very popular move, so I'd guess that it
wouldn't be tried until a) foreign crypto apps become a significant
obstacle to the NSA, and b) other methods have been exhausted.

@_subject: Re: Stealth PGP work 
Derek Atkins  writes on cpunks:
I presume he means stealth, and the functionality that it provides, as
a filter for pgp versions 2.x.  The question in the minds of users of
this utility (for steganography applications) I think will be will
stealth still work with pgp3.0, and would it useful to include as
built-in functionality for pgp3.0.  I raised this question myself to
the pgp3 development team some time ago, and the reply I got was
essentially that it would still be possible to have as an add-on, so
there was no need to clutter the pgp3 functionality.
Henry Hastur's stealth 1.3 is included with pgp2.6.3i in the
contributions directory...
For steganography applications both are required (actually a
transformation formulated by Hal Finney, or an equivalent by Bodo
Moeller is necessary to add more than casual strength to the degree of
plausible deniability due to the fact that the rsa encrypted header
will always be less than the rsa modulus).
I haven't looked at the PGP3 API, but why will a stealth option not
fit?  If stealth can perform the operation as a separate program, why
is it infeasible or difficult for pgp3 to support a stealth option,
and another to support unstealth to a particular recipient.  (With
stealth on decrypt the user provides the user id they think the
message will be addressed to).
On encrypt, the stealth operation should be real easy to implement
inside PGP, it is just another post-filter operation like ascii armor,
stealth instead.
On decrypt, it is more tricky because firstly you loose information
about what kind of data it was, and secondly because you loose the
recipient user id if it was encrypted data.
However, if you provide an API call to unarmor with out decrypting,
and a call to decrypt with out uncompressing, etc then a call to test
for a particular user id on the assumption that it is addressed to
that user id and is an encrypted message would fit in a similar way?
Also note that the rest of the information, once this operation has
suceeded is retained inside the encryption envelope - the length tag,
signature, whether it is further compressed, and so forth.
The stealth operation as implemented in Henry's 1.3 is not all that
secure, and I had an attempt at implementing Hal Finney's algorithm to
produce a stealth 2.0.  My attempts are at:
This is beta code, and I presume the reason that Stale included
stealth 1.3 rather than stealth2.01b with pgp263i was either that 2.01
is beta, or because he did not know it existed.
The reason that the code is beta, is that I had a problem in
implementing stealth as a standalone.  The problem is that Hal's
algorithm has a requirement for cryptographic quality random numbers.
It seems silly to duplicate all this code inside stealth when pgp
provides it internally.  And the (+makerandom=n file) option is not
convenient, because stealth is invoked as a filter with pipes, and
invoking pgp twice doesn't seem like a good idea.  It might even be
dangerous (interferring with the normal sequence of randseed
stirring)?  Besides I had gone to some pains in stealth2.0 to ensure
that nothing hit the disk at all if sufficient memory was available to
do without.
stealth allows you to specify encrypt or decrypt, if decrypt the user
id to insert.  It also supports conventional encryption.
That would be a useful functionality from stealths point of view.
He expressed his request in terms of customer demand...
PGP was started on idealogical grounds, my argument for including
stealth, or as much stealth compatible options as fit within the API
model, is that there are countries where crypto is illegal.  It is not
100% certain that the US won't one day join them (what do you rate the
odds of a mandatory GAK appearing in the US?).  I'd view it as part of
PGP's guerrilla privacy features, and a precaution against such worst
case scenarios.  Besides stego applications have their own set of
uses, albeit they are not in mainstream use in the same way that pgp
I'd prefer to see the discussion on the list, or at least cc me in
such discussion.  Any reason for private email?  The topic is

Some corrections: I (Adam Back) wrote the www page you refer to, the
attribution to Paul Leyland  on that page is
refering to his implementation of a OTP in 1 line of C which I
included with permission:
Neglecting the misattribution, some comments on IPG's claims are in
order.  My page mentions that OTPs are provably secure:
: "OTPs are provably unconditionally secure"
BUT, I also go to great pains to make clear that the security of OTPs
rests critically on the true randomness of the PAD:
: Generating OTPs
: : It can't be stressed enough how important it is to have a truly random
: OTP.  Just using the random() function provided with C
: libraries is nowhere near good enough, these typically have a seed of
: one 32 bit word, so that even if you used the millisecond of your
: clock as a seed the whole system could be broken with a brute force
: keysearch of all possible seeds.  In cryptographic terms a 32 bit
: keyspace is tiny, and would take a negligble amount of compute time to
: break.
: : : : Basically if you use pseudo-random number generators they are going to
: be the weak point in the system, unless you have external input like a
: radio-active decay card, or timings of the milliseconds between
: keystrokes with proper entropy estimation as used by PGP.
I'm sure everyone reading understands ad nauseum about OTPs etc, but I
would like to take the opportunity to distance myself from any claims
being made by IPG, and to state categorically as the author of the www
page quoted that I do not agree with IPG interpretation of what one
can legitimately call a secure OTP system.
I think (and this has been pointed out repeatedly to POTP in the past)
that you would go a lot further if you made realistic claims, and used
standard nomenclature.
If you have a new stream cipher using a PRNG, say so, publish the
algorithm for peer review, and go from there.  It is the calling it
something which it is not which generates criticism out of hand.
People look no further.  I'd suggest replacing marketing at IPG with
some one who can at least sound convincing.  As lots of people have
said: publish the algorithm.

I think this is the crux of the problem - they are simply misnaming
their proprietry algorithm.
I don't see any stigma attached with IPG admitting they have a PRNG
seeded with a key, and XORing the PRNG stream with the data - this is
exactly what RC4 does.  But of course RC4 (now) has the advantage of
open review, and before that it had the advantage of Ron Rivests
reputation associated with it.  Simply change all the literature to
replace "OTP" with "PRNG", or "seed" in appropriate places.
So, submitting your PRNG for open peer review would be a good start.
But I don't think the fact that IPG generates the keys for their
clients is good.  I don't see this as a viable key distribution
But you *really* must stop equating your system with a one time pad,
it absolutely is NOT a OTP.
I do hope IPG will take the trouble to consider comments such as this,
and Perrys comments above, if they are at all serious about their
system every gaining any reputation.

On the ITAR issue, and whether this is a big deal for someone living
in the US, it seems to me that the major annoyance of ITAR is that it
slows down development, and commercial uptake of crypto because the
internet is a worldwide market place.
ie I would have thought that getting rid of ITAR would be beneficial
to internet commerce in general, and likely advance uptake of
electronic cash (by several years?)  For whatever reasons (best known
to themselves) even big fish like netscape, and microsoft don't seem
to have any stomach for taking on the USG in any meaningful way over
the issue.
I'd view widely deployed electronic cash to be a step in the right
direction opening the way for more interesting crypto applications.

@_subject: Re: Opiated file systems 
For plausibility it would probably be best if very few people used the
duress key feature.
If PGP had an infrequently used duress key feature, it would provide
quite a bit of plausible deniability: lots of people have PGP.
This was the basis for comments earlier in this thread about it being
desirable to have a very popular file system with these features
included.  The more users (mostly for it's normal features) the less
suspicious having the software on your system becomes.
One problem is that some of the additional requirements to do a good
job of obscuring whether or not there is data in the unused part of an
encrypted file system add overheads.
For example re-encrypting the unused data with random IVs so that it
doesn't appear stale even if the duress key feature was not requested.
If that overhead is too great it will be annoying for people who do
not wish to use the duress key feature.  It might possibly be a good
idea to do re-encrypting of the blocks anyway as it would obscure
usage patterns.  (eg I am thinking when the disk starts up it will be
cold, as it warms up the heads will be positioned fractionally
differently, and from this kind of analysis it might be possible to
make inferences about the amount of data used in the file system,

@_subject: DES brute force? (was: Re: Borders *are* transparent) 
Hmm, 56 bits is a lot of bits... Here's some calcuations of my own for your criticism...
using libdes-3.23 running the "speed" application, on a 100Mhz SGI R4000 Indy, I get
~600k key shedules / sec.  (With the ~Mb/s throughput for encrypt, the
bottle neck for simplistic brute force is going to be key scheduling).
56 bits = 72057594037927936 worst case
So ideally for a break you would like the whole thing to be completed
in say 2 weeks wall clock time, which gives rise to the need for
~100,000 machines of similar throughput, full-time for two weeks.
As far as cash prizes go how much could cypherpunks and friends
generate for such a purpose?  I'd guess individuals could come up with
a fair bit of money... 1000+ list members x 10$ = 10k (or whatever).
Also perhaps there are some commercial backers with interests in
seeing ITAR squished who might be persuaded to donate?
Somebody would need to spend a fair bit of effort publicising it on
USENET, to get a good response.
There may be problems associated with offering prize money... what if
some employees at DES hardware vendors `borrowed' some time on their
top of the range DES cruncher?  Perhaps this doesn't matter, as it
would just make the point even more strongly :-)
Also I can't help wondering if there isn't some lateral thinking we
can do to reduce the cost...
Are there cheap (<100$) PC DES cards which would help significantly?
What DES modes are used in typical banking situations?  (I am
presuming a challenge involving a widely used banking funds transfer
protocol would be a suitably juicy targets, based on a criteria of
demonstrating the greatest financial risk).
Are there any practical published attacks on DES which have space /
time trade offs which improve on simplistic brute force whilst still
having relatively low memory requirements for each node, and very low
communication requirements?
