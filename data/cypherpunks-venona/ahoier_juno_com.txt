is!!!!!  I f somebody could please e-mail me some more info on crypto and

@_subject: PGP Key or Public Key Block 
Which do I put in my e-mails to the list my PGP KEY OR PUBLIC KEY
BLOCK?????????????????  The PGP Block I got off thr NET on some1's web
site on this list and somebody gave me the PGP KEY!!!!!!  Will that
help????  Or do I use the Public Key to decrypt PGP Messages??  N E wayz
here they BOTH R!!!!!
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
Version: PGP for Personal Privacy 5.0
MessageID: HyRMcbGm8DN7BxUVL/6EunpyDLmTX8Wj
-----END PGP SIGNATURE
----------BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6.2
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Did I just make a mistake?  BTW, How  _DO_ I decrypt messages (PGP)?
Because I just Copy $ Paste the Keys to my letters because I dont have a
PGP PROGRAM!!!!!!!!!  Hope I didn't make a mistake!!!!!!!!!
