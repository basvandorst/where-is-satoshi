@_subject: Groups of prime order 
Hi CP's!
Hope someone would be so kind to help me wiht this:
Is it weaker to use arithmetic mod (p-1), and hence all Zp, when suggested to work in a group of prime order q?
This question is connected with discrete log signature protocols such as that in Pedersen's "Improved privacy in Wallets with Observers" or I would appreciate any help ASAP, since I'm in a hurry.
Please, answer me by personal mail since I'm not subscribed to the CPs list now.
Thanks and best wishes from Poland.
            Joanna
