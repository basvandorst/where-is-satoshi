Cryptograms on Gold bars from China
The following mystery was brought to IACR by the curator of a museum in the US. I don't have the complete story, but it seems that seven gold bars
were allegedly issued to a General Wang in Shanghai, China, in 1933. These gold bars appear to represent metal certificates related to a bank deposit with
a U.S. Bank. The gold bars themselves have pictures, Chinese writing, some form of script writing, and cryptograms in latin letters. Not surprisingly, there is a dispute concerning the validity of the claim for the deposit. It may
help to resolve the dispute if someone can decipher the cryptograms on the bars. Nobody has yet
put for the a theory as to their meaning. I am also unable to recognize the script writing. The
Chinese writing has been translated, and discusses a transaction in excess of $300,000,000. It also refers to these gold bars which weigh a total of 1.8 kilograms. To assist in your investigation, I have compiled the cryptograms and their arrangements. Below are images of the bars, available in two sizes. The ones shown here are about 20K each, and clicking on any of them will download a larger version (about 200K). The gold bars were photographed against a blue or green background that appears around some edges. Unfortunately, neither I nor IACR can provide any further information regarding this. If you are
seriously interested in trying to solve the mystery, I advise you to contact one of the following

Two reports lagging the attack on tamperproof devices
 post last night from the Info Sec Group of NUS (which
 we've put at:  10-22-96. Reu:
 "Singapore scientists invent secure Internet system"
 The new system, developed by the NUS team in
 collaboration with several banks for Singapore at a cost of
 Singapore $500,000 (US$355,000), used smartcard technology
 which allowed the transmission of hidden digital signatures.
 Sponsors of the new system include Singapore's four large banks

 Corp Ltd, Overseas Union Bank Ltd, United Overseas Bank Ltd

 Biometric Technology Firm Refutes Reports of Vulnerability  to Smart Card
 A biometric facial recognition protects smart cards from tampering  by denying access even if digital codes are obtained. According  to the company's president, recent  reports from U.S. and Israeli  researchers on ways to crack encryption codes are needlessly  alarming security managers in government and industry.
