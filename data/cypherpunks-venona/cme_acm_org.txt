Clint Brooks of NSA repeated this assertion, at least once.  He said it
during the August 17, 1995 meeting as well.
I find this interesting, not least as a violation of security.  This
amounts to an open declaration that NSA can break through 64-bit keys.
Could it be that NSA was miffed at being upstaged in the announcement of
breaking through a 40-bit key and wanted to up the ante? .... :-)

You're right, of course.  That's why I, personally, would trust my key
backup only to (k of n) TIS DRCs in Earth orbit or farther out.
People keep assuming that TIS will run a commercial DRC.  We do not plan
to.  We did the design and will sell DRC hardware and security consulting
(physical, policy, ...) to companies wanting to set up their own for
internal use.  That's the only mass DRC market we envision.  This could
change, but that's the current plan.
Meanwhile, the real question is GAK -- whether the DRC you choose to use
goes along with it or not.  You might check my home page for my views on
GAK.  It is possible to have a Corporation running a DRC which refuses to
play along with GAK.  They won't be blessed for attachment to exportable
crypto, most likely, but it's entirely possible for this to exist.  Tim May
may run one, for example.  (I'd still want it to be in orbit.)

It could be even worse.  I was on a panel last year with Scott Charney (sp?)
(I believe from DoJ) during which he commented that if you give your secret
key to anyone -- e.g., your own company -- then you have given up the
presumption of privacy.  That leaves the police open to get that secret
without a warrant.  This claim should be checked by a real lawyer.

This assumes that the purpose of the ITAR restrictions is to keep a secret.
To the extent that the gov't argues that, they have no case as you point
However, the ITAR is there specifically to frustrate US businesses if they
should want to sell or give away crypto overseas.  The rules, despite their
illogic, achieve that goal.
I would like to believe that the Supremes would rule that the Gov't has no
right to use what amounts to a secrecy provision just for harrassment --
but they might not.
I had Mike Nelson say to my face, 1.5 years ago, that he knows good crypto
is available to foreigners -- he just wants to make damn sure it doesn't
come in shrink-wrapped packages from US companies.  I can't judge the
constitutionality of that position but it holds together logically.

@_subject: Re: Clipper III analysis 
There were a number of flaws in that paper, but perhaps the most glaring to
me is that there are actually 3 classes of key:
the two you mentioned:
Of these, you want key recovery *only* for storage keys.  You want to make
sure no one can get to your signature key.  Even the IWG paper notes that.
But the only use for a PKI of any form is for a signature key.  Once you
have your identity established somehow for a signature key, you can
generate and sign comm or storage keys at will.  Furthermore, if you lose a
signature key, there's no big loss.  You generate a new one and get a new
cert for it.  So there's *NEVER* a reason for key recovery for a signature
key -- the only keys for which there is a need for a PKI.
I find myself wondering.
Did some very clever crypto-theoretician plant this idea in their heads
(sig key database giving GAK) knowing that the structure had termites?
I first heard this from Micali...and here I always thought he was on their
side.  I may have misjudged the man. :)

The NRC gets points for putting out a report that will become useful in
the months to come.  The White House gets an 'F' for their handling of
encryption policy.  Even in the face of two expert studies on their policy,
they continue to stick to a failed, unpopular policy.
I was at the EPIC conference yesterday (6/3) -- where Whit Diffie, BTW, presented the same argument Steven Cherry gave in this BillWatch  -- but at the end of the EPIC conference we had Scott Charney of DoJ on a panel about what the OECD is doing (pushing Clipper internationally) and we kept going round with him on the administration's pushing of Clipper (N). [One attendee described this as "forum shopping" -- looking for a friendly place to push Clipper.]
There were people battling him over his alleged representation of the USA at the OECD -- claiming he was misrepresenting the country by pushing Clipper.  His response was that the Executive is empowered to do all international meetings/negotiations/....
After the meeting ended it hit me what the problem is and I mentioned it to PRZ.  We're complaining that the Executive has gone rogue -- is disobeying the will of the people.  PRZ likened it to Nixon's war in Cambodia.
So, maybe it's nothing new -- just a new playing field for the same old game.

@_subject: Re: Federal Key Registration Agency 
If the plaintext is ASCII text, the time is the same but the machine is a
little more expensive.  What you do is process 8 or more blocks of
ciphertext in parallel, matching the high order bit of each byte to 0.
With 8 blocks, you get 64 high order bits -- more than the number of key
bits -- so you're not likely to guess wrong.
If the signal is audio instead of text, I don't know what you look for.
That depends on the compression algorithm.
If the signal is compressed text, again I would need to see the comressor
If all you have is one or two blocks of text (e.g., a bank transaction) you
decrypt and decide whether the result is just impossible.  If it's possible
(and there will be many) you send the trial key on to a second processor (a
more general one) to try that key on the whole message to decide if the
message is still possible.
If that processor likes a given key, you send the result to a human -- who
chooses among all the possibles.
In other words, this doesn't have to be one-step-to-success.  All you're
doing is pruning the keyspace to something more manageable.

@_subject: Re: Reasonable validation of a software package 
["this" being the possibility that someone would generate lots of signed
public keys with your name on them]
However, there's nothing to stop generation of many certificates from
trusted CAs with your name on them.  In fact, if you have a name like
Michael Smith, and if a CA is successful, there *will be* lots of
certificates with your name on them, even without anyone's trying to do
anything crooked.
The problem people overlook is that a CA binds a public key to a name but
the name is in the CA's name space.  For me, a verifier, to derive any
value from a certificate binding (key,name), the name has to be in *my*
name space.
If there were such a thing as a global namespace meaningful to everyone,
then we could both use it.  That's the X.500 falacy/pipe-dream.
The fact is, no global name space could be held in one human's mind, so
there's no way a global name space could be meaningful to me.
So, to use a certificate from a CA, I need to map a name from its name
space (DN) into a name in my name space (nickname).  Every time I've looked
at that process, I've had to have a secure channel over which to learn from
the person I call by that nickname what DN he goes by.  If I have that
secure channel, then he could tell me his public key fingerprint ove that
cnnel -- and I wouldn't need the CA.

The mistake is to think of using ID certificates (like those from Verisign)
in the first place.  They don't mean anything.
You want an authorization certificate, such as produced by SPKI.  You need
to know what a key is authorized to do, not what name is associated with
the key.

You're right.  SPKI doesn't solve the whole problem, by itself.  You do
need to avoid ID certificates in the first place.  They have no use here
because he wants anonymous authorization.  He also wants it blinded.  SPKI
includes a construct for passing some authorization to anything signed by a
given public key.  That gives him his blinding.
However, he has an additional problem.  He's trying to set up what amounts
to a voter registration.  Rather, he appears to hope that someone else will
do so.  AFAIK, there is no currently proposed PKI which will do the (one
body:one valid cert) mapping he's looking for.  However, if he finds some
organization willing to do that, then he can use the SPKI certs to transfer
authorization (e.g., to log in on his service) to a key used for that
purpose by that organization.  Certainly, ID certs from VeriSign or GTE or
anyone else I've heard of don't fill that role.
As a native Chicagoan, I can attest to the difficulty of performing (one
body):(one vote) mappings   :)  [I know -=- slander of my beloved home town]
I'm also not sure we want anyone setting up such a service except for
voting.  There can be very bad societal drawbacks to a service like that.
It might be able to achieve all the evil which we decry when the idea of a
national ID card comes up.
