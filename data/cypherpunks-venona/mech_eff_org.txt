@_subject: Re: Cypherbusts, etc. 
Great!  One thing to do would be to do editorials for as many papers as
possible.  The greatest problem facing "us" (meaning anyone opposing the
clipper fiasco), is that the general populace are ignorant, by and large
of the following things:
1) what encryption/cryptography is, and why they should care.
2) that any successful attempt to squash public cryptography and replace it
   with govt. spy-mechanisms sets a really terrible precedent.  In following
   decades we would likely see the removal of more rights and privacy, and
   the approval of ever more invasive "law enforcement" techniques.
3) what the history of agencies such as NSA and the SS is, and why they
   are not to be trusted (noting that Treasury controls not only Customs, who
   are responsible for enforcing many of the laws affecting crypto, but
   the SS, and BATF, could be of use.  We are supposed to trust some
   unspecified Treasury sub-bureaucracy [not to mention NIST] to hold the
   keys to our privacy in the right hand, while menacing users of private
   cryptography via subpoenas and grand juries with the left hand?)
4) that BILLIONS of dollars every year are lost by US businesses to the
   industrial espionage of foreign competitors, who are under no ITARish    restrictions on how they protect what they hold.
5) that the ITAR and the Clipper/Capstone/Clipjack scheme threatens to destroy
   the US market for cryptographic applications, while this market, with a    potential easily in the billions of dollars per year, goes to other
   nations.  With one exception of course: PKP/RSADSI, who have a virtual    monopoly on crypto in this country due to patents on algorithms (aka
   "ownership" of properties of mathematics, "possession" of natural
   processes of the universe.  What next?  Will GE get a trademark on
   sunlight?)  Ask the hard question: What is the relationship between PKP/RSA
   and the US Government?  Why is RSA granted these patents?  Why does
   NIST insist on giving exclusive license on DSA encryption to RSA, despite
   the fact that DSA was developed with YOUR tax money, not the capital of a
   private business entity?
6) that it is painfully obvious that the "to stop drug dealers, child
   molesters, and terrorists" rhetoric is a very lame and transparent excuse.
   Not even a stupid criminal would use crypto that the govt. freely admits
   was designed with wiretapping in mind.  The ONLY way that Clipper could
   be useful is if all other forms of cryptography that the govt. cannot crack
   are BANNED outright.  Given that it seems clear that the targets are
   not nebulous Bad Guys (TM), but the US citizenry at large.  Lest this sound
   paranoid, note that even when directly asked, the govt. has yet to deny
   it is NOT considering banning non-Clipper cryptographic applications.
   Beyond this, the original proposal hinted strongly that the "key escrow
   agents" would not be govt. agencies.  So much for that.  NSA's lackey,
   NIST, on one hand, and our friends the Treasury on the other.  Boy, I sure
   feel safe, don't you?
There's plenty of other issues, but that's a good place to start.  As has
been adequately hashed out here, there's not much for J. Random Citizen to do
about the subpoenas.  This does not hold true of the entire Clipper
scheme, nor of the NIST/PKP scandal.  Make it plain to your readers that
crypto is important, and is for them.  Make it obvious that they DO have a
stake in what is going on right now, and they can play a part.

Sorry to respond to such an old post, but I can't let this one slip by.
Why not encourage people to be responsible for their OWN mail/news?
Relying on moderators to wipe noses and spank boodies is not going to help anyone in the long run.  FidoNet has had a great deal of difficulty
with moderators, and there is no need to spread this problem to UseNet.
The responsibility for you reading or not reading anon posts lies on YOUR
head.  If you do not like them, then learn to use the filtering
capabilities of your software.  If you don't have a news reader that will
do elaborate filters, try strn. At any rate, it is my firm opinion that moderation belongs in academic and
hard-science conferences, and those that require a very firmly focussed
range of topics to be of use.  The encouragement of more moderation, and
more moderator "jobs" like filtering out anonymous postings is a very bad
idea, and in particular, the inclusion of special headers for this purpose
will simply suggest to moderators that they filter all such mail by
default, and not even bother to try to determine relative merits.  It's
counterproductive to the entire idea of anonymous posting.

Which will result in newgroups banning anon mail wholesale.  There are
other filtration methods besides using the full address of the remailer.
Simply filtering out all mail from userIDs "anonymous" and "nobody" will
kill most anon mail as it is.
But of course it is related to banning anon postings in whole groups. They can already filter out this stuff without that much of a hassle as
can anyone.  Really, the idea of standardizing the anon remailers is not
that big a deal, I just see it as a step in the wrong direction, at least
until anon mail is more  accepted.  It will just make it slightly more
easy to filter out anon mail, and at a time when lots of admins and
moderators are frowning up anon mail, is this such a good idea?
Hahahah, I'm not trying to stop a [useful] technological development, just
slowdown a potentially worse-than-useless one until anon mail is more
accepted, at which point standardizing would be a good idea.  Your last
sentence above...when do I ever advocate otherwise? :)
This argument I really don't follow.  I don't see how standardizing this
mailing software to produce a specific header line will change anyone's
opinion or remailers or anonymity on the net.  Well over a year ago, some
Fido-tech software authors came up with a similar idea for marking
encrypted mail (specifically they created the ^enc PID kluge line, which
is pretty much analogous to a type of mail header).  The result was that
no one's opinion of crypto in FidoNet appears to have changed, and the
debate rages on just as before.
Well I'm temp. out of Fido, for a week or so, due to the move, but if you
mean the CP argument, I'm still sorting through it (again, due to moving,
I have a major backlog, like 600+ emails). If you mean the general idea of
le crypto en Phydeaux, well that's been raging for a year or 2 or 4. Quite a few of us decided 'heck with it', and started a secondary hub
backbone system called the SecureMail system, which WILL carry encrypted
mail.  Just search the nodelist for the UNSMH and URSMH flags (that's Net
SecureMail Hub, and Region SM Hub.)  The EFF-BBS that's coming soon will
likely been one such hub.

@_subject: Re: Virtual City (tm) and Virtual Capitalism 
Well, this is true of MOOs in general but not MUDs most of which are D&D-style
combat games, wherein virtual money already plays a strong role; many
muds have banks, which have fees, interest rates, etc., and loan sharks
abound.  RL money does not come into it, and barter is usually quite
acceptable.  I agree that the whole idea is rather trivial, but it would seem to be a
good test, at least: see if MUDdom will cooperate enough to have a
networked form of MUDbucks.  I don't think most MUDs would go for the
players being able to buy power(s) outright, but goods should not be a
problem.  Anyway, the difference between the typical MOO and typical MUD
community is very great in many ways and it doesn't do to conflate them.
The capitalists here probably think that's a great idea, though the LPF
fans here would disagree.  This strikes me as remarkably similar to a BBS-
based idea that went around for a while, to have BBSbucks, that one could
spend to get online time on any participating BBS.  One got the bucks by
uploading to file oriented boards, posting on msg. oriented boards, etc.  Of
course, sysops in general slammed the idea, since it was immediately
obvious to most of them that people would manipulate the less popular and
more open (by necessity) boards.  People would call some newbie board, and
upload garbage to it, knowing that the sysop would not say much about it,
being in the process of trying to get new users and keep them, then take
the electricash to the popular boards.  If one looks at BBSs like
countries, it would be as if they were 3rd world nations being farmed for
their cheap resources and labour, and all the money goes out of the
country to the Big Empires.
Well, one can remove the necessity, for now, that RL money be paid.  What
then is the real objection?  I can see nothing keeping the idea from working.
As for the RL for digicash scenario, well *I* wouldn't play, having better
things to waste money on, but if some will, why not?  Why should MUD
programmers and site providers have to do it all for free, while their
game-programming counterparts in the online services rake in good salaries?
At times I shudder to think what it's costing in bandwidth to keep all
these NeTrek players going, night and day.  Make them PAY a little for it
(not much, but enough that they notice), place the financial burden where
it belongs. Note: my commentary on MUD/MOO practices dates from 92, so it may be
outdated by this point, seeing how fast that virtcom changes.

Hi Stanton.
Duncan asked:
The case to which Duncan is referring is U.S. v. X-Citement Video, Inc.,
decided last December in Pasadena, CA.  The Ninth District Court didn't
hold that the transport and sale provisions of the federal child porn
statute were unconstitutional.  What it did hold was that the statute was
unconstitutional in that it did not require knowledge by the prosecuted
individual of the age of the depicted youth.  The court was clear to
distinguish the lack of a knowledge requirement of the age of the depicted
youth (which was unconstitutional) from the lack of knowledge that the
files were sent (in this case mailed, which the court held was not really
an issue.)  My warning to sysops simply said that these files were listed
on a federal indictment, so the "lack of knowledge of the age of the
depicted people" defense remains -- I did not identify the people depicted
as being under the age of 18.  (I couldn't have done so -- I haven't seen
the files.  I was only passing on the info contained on the indictment.)
In addition, provisions of a federal statute are not officially
unconstitutional in all jurisdictions until the U.S. Supreme Court declares
them to be so.  (In other words, the court's decision is only binding on
the 9th Circuit.)
P.S. Say hi to the 'punks for me.  I really enjoyed the list, but the

I won't speak for CPs at large on what is important to them, but I think
several things are a little off here.  To keep it short, and hopefully end
this marginal thread, the important difference between the "warnings" from
EFF and CERT [the old one, not the recent one about the security tester]

the message in question was rather big brotherish.  Does anyone here

The EFF on the other hand posted this material specifically to help people
AVOID being trapped in a situation that may result in prison terms.  The
other side of the fence entirely.  As I've explained to Lance in email,
it's like the difference between a cop saying "I don't think you should be
drinking", and a person warning their friend drinking in the park,"Better
ditch that beer, here come the cops."
That, and I really don't think that the TONE of "voice" of the messages in

I don't think that's quite the point.  The point that's just one instance.
This is part of the problem of our current govt. and current law being
obsolete.  The recent child porn BBS busts are another good example.  The
law is clear on kiddie porn.  If you have it, and don't know it it doesn't
matter.  All someone has to do is upload a child porno file to your BBS in
the middle of the night and immediately call the cops and report you, to
get you arrested and quite possibly convicted.  All I have to do to shut
down your remailer, or your anything, is *tell* the SS that you want to kill
the president.  By policy, they treat all threats as real, so you WILL
probably get a visit from them (as I understand SS operating procedures,
Given the SJG case, I think they'd be much more cautious and thorough in
their preparations, and would not repeat the mistakes that would lead to
supposing outcome a). I don't think the SS would even understand what b). is.
The NSA, on the other hand... >:)
Probably because the phone service is regulated, national, well established,
while BBSs or Internet sites are not.  This does not mean that the lack of
common carrier status is just, by any means, but I think this is the
rationale that would come into play, like it or not.
Count on it.  Things are moving much too slowly on "our" side.  Entities
like AT&T, Warner, etc. stand a good chance of controlling much of what
becomes "the net" in the future, if much of this technology is not:
1) in place and functional
2) easy to use by the clueless and lazy as well as techies
3) accepted for use within the network, indeed considered *part of* the
   network both as "flavour" and technical specifications
4) impossible to remove - no govt/corporate turning back of the tide
VERY soon.  In addition the populace has to become aware of:
1) the fact that computers are not to be feared, but are an empowering tool
2) the fact that a computer that cost $2000 10 years ago costs $200 now.
3) what networking is, what it is good for, and how they can get in on it
4) HOW to do all of this - easy "newbie" software is needed - plug-n-play
5) that privacy is possible.  Most have forgotten this.
6) what good privacy and control over their electronic acitivies is for them
7) that it's easy
8) that the govt/corps/media do not like it and are not to be trusted to look
   after one's own rights.  They need to see that it is exactly this misplaced
   trust that has yielded wiretapping, work place monitoring, TRW, the
   ment to use SSN for almost everything, non-secure purchasing (credit
   cards, etc.)  Media falsehood, inaccuracy, and ignorance of important
   topics, even deliberate ignoring of relevant facts, in media "service"
   that is one-way, dictated, censored, and unexpandable.

that psychopaths are generally dysfunctional enough that they will not do
well in a medium like this.  And if there were a lot of them around, we'd
already be seen decidedly psychopathic abuse of the net; instead we get
immature spam, and other wastes of bandwidth but nothing particularly serious.
I think we need to draw some distinctions between what is a possible
threat or problem and was is a likely threat or problem.  I certainly side with you on this one.  I know quite a few people who do
this, both on "the" net, and in BBS-based networks (as if there's much
difference these days.)
What is "reasonably secure"?  I can't think of any "reasonable" definition
of that.  Something secure from YOU, with your 386 or Mac, that is NOT
secure from the US govt. is not reasonably secure to me.  In fact it is
woefully insecure, IMNERHO.

human nature to have multifaceted personalities, and I for one don't see
any real difference between wearing black and being glum one day while
wearing colours and being cheerful the next, and using 2 different online
pseudos.  It may not be CONVENIENT for the reader, but is it really
anyone's business if I am who I say I am, and if someone else that they've
been conversing with is also me?  It is unusual, but it's not evil.  It's
really no more strange that halloween or a masquerade ball.
In the case of forged identities stolen from someone else, yes that could
be a problem, but the problem is not the technology that allows it, but
the ATTITUDE that allows it.  Guns don't kill people, people do.
This is patently false.  I say this on the grounds that in ALL cases of
ALL email, people know that the message can be from anyone.  Period.  End
of story.  If you do not authenticate the message w/a digital sig, and if
the recipient does not verify it, that is NOT the fault of the
technology that makes "pseudospoofing" possible, it is the fault of the
users, if they believe that mail that says it's from X must perforce
necessarily be from X.  If people do NOT know this, it is again not the
fault of the net or of anonymous services, it is the fault of the
clueless.  What you advocate seems strikingly like suggesting that we
eradicate emacs, because someone somewhere might not RTFM and might cry
and whine about not being able to use it right. You most assuredly cannot confidently attribute any non-signed (and
unverified-by-you) message to any unique person, by the definition of what
email consists of and how it is produced.  Simply the existence of
"pseudospoofing" makes this so.
This also makes no sense to me.  How can one be said to be
"quasi-accountable", particularly since there is no way for you to
acertain that they DO only have one pseudo?  To be accountable, someone or
something must make you account.
Not to mention the rather stale (and, someone would say sooner or later,
racist) psychology at work here.  I don't argue from the "PC" side of
things, but "black and white"?  Come now.  The real world, whether virtual
or otherwise is a very very grey place.  This Tolkienism is simply
impractical.  How is this destructive?  If I see a man on the street, and later that
night go out to a local concert, and am entertained by a "woman" singer that
is actually the man I passed that morning, in drag, what damage has been
done?  Has my life suddenly been shattered, the fabric of society ripped
apart, because I've see the same physical person in 2 outfits, and was
none the wiser?  If I "meet" 2 "individuals" virtually on the net, and
they are the same person, how have I, or the net, been harmed?  Provided
no one is trying to defraud me, what have I lost?  What have you lost? And whoever it is behind the multiple idents may actually GAIN, if they
are the sort of person that cannot fully express themselves without
playing a role (which is a signifcant proportion of the people in the world).
Who are YOU to take that away from them?
This whole line of argument strongly reminds me of the the one that goes
like this: online communication is a bad thing, because people don't
behave like their true selves, and misrepresent themselves.  We should ban
computer mediated communcation, because it is a heartless sham, a cold
fraudulent falsehood, and will be misused by the schizoprenic and the
Puh-leeeeze.  I discard this conspiracy theory on the basis that you
accuse them of what you would yourself do: keep people from using the
capability [whether it's true or not is irrelevant].
I take that back, this isn't Tolkienish, it's Lovecraftian.  I would like
to remind you that "evil" is a term from "morals", which are baseless and
have no universality outside the closed group.  If you wish to discuss
whether using pseudonymy in this manner is *ethical* or not, then by all
means please do so.

At my peak, which I am reaching again, about 25 or more; counting
newsgroups, Fido echos, and the like, I follow several 100 online

With UUCP, Fido <-> UUCP gating, or pure Fido or QWK mail, I can generate
as many personae as I wish. To a large extent, and growing, though probably less than 1% of personae

To be serious again, who knows?  I think it highly likely.
Certainly.  Not that often, but it comes in handy.

fraudulent use of another's name or reputation (i.e. posing a non-existent
big-wig at IBM) is a phone call.
I am neutral on it, just as I am neutral on the issue of what anyone does

support if of (the tool, not the attack).
I think so.  I think it is immediately apparent to anyone that uses this
medium more than casually and for a short time that all is not as it seems
and that forgery of postings is not particularly surprising.
Anything is feasible.  The question is what price will you pay to remove
this capability from the system? (incl. human costs, not just monetary ones.)
No one needs you to protect us from ourselves or eachother.
What is an "internet policy in general"?  I have yet to see such a thing. There would appear to be no RFCs on the subject if that is what you mean,
and netiquette doesn't seem to mind, it THAT's what you mean.  I'm not
sure the next questions under section 12 have any relevancy to anything. Please define "should".  Who get's to decide what "should" be done?  It
might be better to ask "what is feasible" and "is there any reason NOT to
allow psuedonymity in whatever form it takes, provided one does not step
on the rights of others?"  Thing is I don't think you could stop it,
unless you completely restructured the net, at all levels from the
mail software to the societal structure.
Have none for you, probably because it's a non-issue.
Sorry to seem like I'm going off on you, but I just don't see the reason
in this entire line of rambling and fingerpointing.  There are certainly
more important things to get excited and active about.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY ROUNDTABLE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                CONTACT:  Jeff Chester

     New Coalition Unveils Public Interest Blueprint
   for America's 21st Century Telecommunications Highway
Washington, DC -- A new coalition, the Telecommunications
Policy Roundtable, is calling on Americans to make their
voices heard on seven vital issues of communications
policy.   The coalition's goal is the creation of new
approaches to building our nation's emerging information
        The Telecommunications Policy Roundtable is a
public interest coalition of more than seventy
organizations.  Its statement of principles comes less
than a month after the Clinton administration released
its own blueprint:  "National Information Infrastructure:
Agenda for Action."  The Clinton program envisions a
national network linking computer, telephone and
television technologies.
        The statement also follows dramatic developments in
the telecommunications industry, including the planned
merger of Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications
Incorporated (TCI).
        The statement, entitled "Renewing the Commitment to
a Public Interest Telecommunications Policy," outlines a
series of  principles, and introduces them with this
credo: "We believe that the following principles must
guide policymaking in order to ensure that future
generations inherit an information infrastructure which
enhances the quality of life for everyone."
The seven principles are:
o       Universal access -- In our information age,
everyone has a right to affordable news, education
and government information.  Information that is
essential to the functioning of citizens in a
democracy should be free.
o       Freedom to Communicate -- Information is a two way
street.  The design of the new networks should aid
two-way audio and video communication from anyone
to any individual, group or network.
o       Vital civic sector -- The new networks should allow
all groups and individuals to freely express their
ideas and opinions.  The new networks should
include a way for us to build communities.
o       Diverse and competitive marketplace --  No one
should ever control both the wire or wires into our
home and the content of the programs that go over
those wires.
o       Equitable workplace -- workers must be valued and
protected in the new electronic workplace.
Nondiscriminatory practices must form the core of
the new information marketplace.
o       Privacy protection -- Privacy should be carefully
protected and extended.
o       Democratic policy making -- Every American deserves
to be heard on this complex set of issues.
        The coalition meets monthly in Washington, DC.  A
complete list of member organizations is attached.

New EFF Open Platform Statement Online
The recent spate of telecommunications mergers -- Bell Atlantic/TCI, US
West/Time-Warner, AT&T/McCaw, plus numerous others in the works -- raise
the stakes for information policy makers and those of us who are concerned
about the development of an open, accessible information infrastructure.  EFF has just released a major new statement on our Open Platform Campaign,
which explains EFF's approach to infrastructure policy.  Our big concern is
encourage Congess and the Administration to do the right thing and set out
a new, positive communications policy that is ready for the information
age.  We believe that this policy must achieve the following goals:
*       Diversity of Information Sources:  Promote a fully interactive
        infrastructure in which the First Amendment flourishes,
        allowing the greatest possible diversity of view points;
*       Universal Service:  Ensure a minimum level of affordable
        information and communication service for all Americans;
*       Free Speech and Common Carriage:  Guarantee infrastructure
        access regardless of the content of the message that the
        user is sending;
*       Privacy:  Protect the security and privacy of all
        communications carried over the infrastructure, and
        safeguard the Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights of all
        who use the information infrastructure;
*       Development of Public Interest Applications and Services:
        Ensure that public interest applications and services
        which are not produced by the commercial market are
        widely available and affordable.
Our policy proposal, available by anonymous ftp on ftp.eff.org in
concrete legislative recommendations on how to accomplish many of these
goals.  Here are a few selected paragraphs from the main paper to give a
flavor of our positions, but we hope you'll read the whole thing.
        "Regulatory changes should be made, and mergers approved or barred
based on specific, enforceable commitments that the electronic
superhighways will meet public goals and realize the potential of digital
technology.  That potential arises from the extraordinary spaciousness of
the broadband information highway, contrasted with the scarcity of
broadcast spectrum and the limited number of cable channels that defined
the mass media era.  Properly constructed and administered, the information
highway has enough capacity to permit passage not only for a band of
channels controlled by the network operator, but also for a common carriage
connection that is open to all who wish to speak, publish, and communicate
on the digital information highway.  For the first time, electronic media
can have the diversity of information we associate only with the print
But we can't rely on the promises of industry or the wonders of the
competitive marketplace alone to create this infrastructure.  We need
legislative benchmarks to ensure that all citizens have access to advanced
information infrastructure.  We will achieve this goal not by having
government build the whole thing, but by finding a new communications
policy framework that works for the market and brings benefits to
We've expanded the concept of "Open Platform Services" from just narrowband
ISDN, to include any switched, digital service, offered on a common
carriage basis, by any provider.
        "To achieve the full potential of new digital media, we need to
make available what we call Open Platform services, which reach all
American homes, businesses, schools, libraries, and government
institutions.  Open Platform service will enable children at home to tie
into their school library (or libraries all around the world) to do their
homework.  It will make it possible for a parent who makes a video of the
local elementary school soccer game to share it with parents and students
throughout the community.  Open Platform will make it as easy to be an
information provider as it is to be an information consumer."
        "Open Platform services provide basic information access
connections, just as today's telephone line allows your to connect to an
information service or the coaxial cable running into your home connects
you to cable television programming.   This is not a replacement for
current online services such as America Online or Compuserve, but rather is
the basic transport capacity that one needs to access the multimedia
version of these information services.
        "Specifically, Open Platform service must meet the following criteria:
*       widely available, switched digital connections;
*       affordable prices;
*       open access to all without discrimination as the content
        of the message;
*       sufficient "up-stream" capacity to enable users to
        originate, as well as receive, good quality video,
        multimedia services.
"Open Platform service itself will be provided by a variety of providers
over interconnected networks, using a variety of wires, fiber optics, coax
cable, and wireless transmission services.  But however it is provided, if
it is affordable and widely available, it will be the on-ramp for the
nation's growing information superhighway."
Rather than a narrow focus on stopping or delaying the proposed mergers,
policy makers should use the leverage of the moment to create a new
Communications Act that serves the public interest.
        "The Administration and Congress can create an prompt the
deployment of open platforms by using the political leverage at its
disposal.  Bell Atlantic, TCI, Time Warner, US West and others involved in
recent mergers are all promising to build open platforms. Telecommunications giants are asking policymakers for permission to enter
new markets or to form new, merged entities.  Rather than per se opposition
to current mergers, or mere reliance on competition to build the data
highways, make the mergers and other accommodations conditional on
providing affordable open platform services.  The terms of this new social
contract should be written into a new Communications Act, revised for the
information age.  With a real "social contract" in hand, we just might
realize the Jeffersonian potential of the data superhighways. "
        "Together with a coalition of public interest groups and private
industry, the Electronic Frontier Foundation is working to establish Open
Platform objectives in concrete legislation.  Open Platform provisions,
which would cause near term deployment of Open Platform services, are
present in both the recent Senate infrastructure bill and the latest draft
of House telecommunications legislation, soon to be introduced.  We are
also working with the Administration to have Open Platform policies
included in the recommendations of the Information Infrastructure Task
Force.  In addition to federal policy, critical decisions about the shape
of the information infrastructure will be made at state and local levels. Since 1991, EFF has been working with a number state legislatures and
public utility commissions to have affordable, digital services offered at
a local level.  As cable and telephone infrastructures converge, we will
also work with local cable television franchising authorities.  We invite
all who are concerned about these issues to join with us in these public
policy efforts."
We hope that everyone will have a look at our new proposal, and join in to
help us.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE OPEN PLATFORM CAMPAIGN CONTACT:

@_subject: Suggested mod to PGP 
An interesting suggestion was passed to me from a FidoNet node, suggesting
a way that might get PGP accepted in BBS-based networks a little easier:
A new commandline switch that will cause PGP to produce it's clearsigning
info, digital signature, etc, as part of a FTSC kluge line, most of which
are "invisible" unless you really try to get at them (in much the same
way that elm will filter out most of the headers, and you have to hit "h"
to see them all).  This would assuage fears of Fidomail becoming
cluttered and unreadable with PGP output.
This reminds me strongly of another recent proposal to have PGP use the
headers, rather than the body of messages, for PG information in
Internet/Usenet messages.  Considering that these 2 similar ideas came
from totally independent sources, this may be a good idea for developers
to look at, since it seems to occur to a lot of people.

NEED STATISTICS ON LOST CRYPTO SALES
The Software Publishers Association (SPA) has been working to bring
about the liberalization of export controls on mass market software
with encryption capabilities.  SPA's much-publicized study of the
foreign availability of cryptographic products has clearly
demonstrated the widespread and easy availability of encryption
that is stronger than what U. S. firms have been able to export.
However, NSA claims that software companies have not demonstrated
sufficiently the economic harm they have suffered from export
controls.  Congress has told us that without better economic harm
statistics, our chances of liberalizing the export laws are slim.
Therefore, WE NEED YOUR HELP.

@_subject: Re: Should we oppose the Data Superhighway/NII? 
That's certainly part of it, though not part of the immediate EFF Open
Platform initiative, which is more national in scope.  This "franchise"
problem is a local matter, and would best be handled by local
organizations.  If you are really concerned with this, try contacting the
Society for Electronic Access (SEA), since you live in NYC.  They may
already be working on this, though I cannot of course vouch for them.
Mailing simona or simona should put you in touch with
them. Why would a "natural monopoly" be any better?  This is a rather moot
point. The problem here is that such monopolistic entities, whatever their
provenance, don't give a rat's ass for whether or not you want a lot of
bandwidth for multimedia email, or whatever.  Left to their own devices,
they'll happly feed you 5000 channels of tv, plus perhaps some
oh-so-interactive teleshopping clubs and the like.
Part of the effort that must be made is to knock some sense into the
rapidly merging entertainment/information/telecom conglomerates, and try
to at very least keep a large section of the "data highway" (or whatever
one chooses to call it) an Internet-like many-to-many communications
medium, if not fused with Internet itself.  Convincing the govt. of this
is will also take some doing.  One certainly can't IGNORE the govt.  No
matter how much we may wish it'd just go away, it won't, and has to be
dealt with.

@_subject: Re: Should we oppose the Data Superhighway/NII? 
[re: EFF NII proposal, ftp.eff.org, /pub/Eff/papers/op2.0]
Why should that be the main focus?  I for one consider modelling the
coming "data highway" on an Internet-like model to be of more concern).  I
have precisely zero use for cable tv (or broadcast tv for that matter),
and very little use for the phone system except as a convenience and a way
to transport FidoNet mail.  Since FidoNet-via-Internet is soon to be a
reality in all likelihood, even that begins to fade. Over 90% of my
communicating is done on Internet or in person.  This is not to say full
privatization of the phone system would not vastly improve Internet, but
at least the net is fairly stable and works.  It's a good place to start.
The creation of a new "infrastructure" (rapidly becoming my least
favourite buzzword) that is modelled on TV rather than many-to-many
networking, would appear to me to be a much more grave danger than the
temporary perpetuation of the current telecom and cable system, which can
be the next thing to work on, once we are ensured the coming BigNet will
be worth the lines it's carried on.

I have pointed this out numerous times to L.D. in private mail, but he
doesn't seem to get the fact that "obvious" is completely subjective. The most recent example I gave was that "James Bond" would appear to be
an obvious pseudo.  Unless your name really IS James Bond (which is
actually not that rare of a name), or you happen to be someone that's
never seen a J.B. movie, or read an Ian Fleming book, such as, say, a guy
from Norway or Japan, in which case it would be quite reasonable to
presume that the person you just got mail from really is named James Bond.
Detweiler's entire proposition hinges on this distinction between
pseudonymy and "pseudoanonymity"/"pseudospoofing".  The distinction does
not actually clearly exist, and his premise (or I should say "its"
premise, since Detweiler has lately claimed to be female) collapses.

just keeps posting and mailing away.  What can ya do?  I for one may just

From the 1st Amendment to the US Constitution:
"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech..."
Mike or another with legal expertise can correct me, but I believe it has
been shown more than once that privacy can be a necessary condition for
freedom of expression.
From the 4th Amendment:
"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,
and effects, against unreasonable seraches and seizures, shall not be
This does not spell out the word "privacy", but the implications would
appear to be plain.
From the 8th Amendment:
"cruel and unusual punishment [shall not be] inflicted".  This MIGHT be grounds for the conclusion that privacy is a right, in such
cases where violation of that privacy may be construed as cruel, or [more
likely] unusual punishment.  Theoretically.  I make no pretense at being
an attorney, or having a wide knowledge of caselaw, I'm just arguing from
a philosophical and logical position.
The 9th Amendment:
"The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."
Looks pretty cut and dry right there.
The 10th Amendment:
"The powers not delegated to the Unites States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or
to *the people*" [emphasis added.] Again, pretty cut and dry. From the 14th Amendment:
"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges
or immunities of citizens of the United States;"
This takes care of the state level as well as federal it would appear.
I make no claim that this is a perfect analysis, but it is food for thought.
It would appear to me that unless one takes privacy to be neither a right
in any manner at all, ever, under any circumstance, nor to be:
a) a power not delegated to the federal govt. or
b) a power not forbidden to the states or specifically delegated to the states
then privacy must perforce be a right or power of the people.
Tell that to the wolf who will happily kill you for invading it's territory.
Tel that to the same wolf who drags your corpse back to it's private, and
jealously defended, private burrow or other shelter. I'm not a proponent of natural rights, just pointing out a gaping hole or
2 in this line of reasoning.
This would appear to be a pretty good analysis.
I think the reason is closer to propaganda.  If the media at large told
people they should want privacy, the odds are they would want privacy. Right now shooting coke dealers is more "sexy", and I think it a fair
assessment that most Americans take their social cues, and much of their
ethics, priorities, and other important aspects of personality from tv and
other media, for better or worse.
This is the reason that getting pro-crypto media attention is essential.
Only when the people realize that drug dealers and largely imaginary
terrorists are a far smaller threat than loss of privacy and other rights,
will the pendulum swing back.
Please explain to me then the presence of laws against peeping tomism,
trespassing, interception of wire communications, etc.  It appears clear
to me from these laws that privacy, of one sort or another, is considered
to be a right, at least in certain applications and circumstances.
The law that created the SSN was not intended to violate privacy.  It is
in fact primarily the states, and especially the private sector, that misuse this tax number to violate privacy.
This is vague.  If you mean the IRS has a right to poke around in your
records to make sure you are not cheating on your taxes, this is not a
right but an entitlement (i.e. a priviledge that restricts a right.)
Similarly a court can demand that you show this document or that.  This is
indeed a violation of your right to privacy, but in it's position as an
entitlement, it is no different that civil forfeiture, searches, emergency
confiscation of a vehicle by police for use in a chase, or the forcing (at
gunpoint if necessary) citizens from their own property in situations of
impending disaster, subpoenas, etc. etc. etc.  This is not a new tale.
Only under certain, very limited, circumstances, and again this is not a
right but an entitlement, since it by definition infringes a right.  If
you don't "get" the distinction, try on this simple example: you have a
right to swing your arm (and please note that it, like the right to
privacy, is another of those rights not specifically enumerated, but
covered by the 9th Amendment), but I have an entitlement to not be hit in
the face by your swinging arm.  My entitlement supercedes your right, but
only under certain circumstances (e.g. when my face is in imminent danger
of being struck by your arm, or has already been struck - assault, and
battery respectively, if intentional - but I cannot use my entitlement to
demand that you _never_ swing your arm).
The FBI's attempt to make their very limited entitlement to wiretapping
into a duty of the populace and the market failed dismally, when their
"Digital Telephony" proposal collapsed.
There is no such duty, except under the limited circumstances where an
entitlement of the govt. requires it.  Cryptography is not likely to
change this any.  Try encrypting all of your records, and refusing to
decrypt them or surrender the key despite a court order to do so.  Unless
you can make a convincing case that to do so would be self-incrimination
(see the 5th Amendment), you'll likely find yourself slapped with a
contempt of court charge.
This is certainly reasonable.  I would like very much to see a new
Amendment that specifically enumerates privacy as a right.
One can hope so, but when the Swiss numbered bank account, the canonical
example, vanishes, I begin to have doubts.
You're welcome, and ditto.

This may have something to so with the large number of cable stations that
don't allow advertising, and have not since day one, because people are
willing to pay extra for ad-less tv.  This also has to do with fact that the most popular shows are on network
broadcast TV, not cable, for a number of reasons.  Advertisers go where
the people are.  Your entire point seems to be that because advertisers
decide that the cable is a lousy market, it does is not "major".  The actual
relationship is quite the opposite.  For many reasons the cable market was
kept from being a "major market" for advertisers, and so advertisers do
not advertise via cable as much as they do via airwaves.  This is all
quite peripheral.
? This is a nonsensical statement.  You seem to presume that a
computer-net market must perforce directly compete with a tv-net market,
when there is room for both.  The slothful and apathetic will happily vege
out in front of the new supertube, and fortunately be mostly selected out
of the memepool, while those with a glimmer of imagination and
intelligence are likely to find a use for interactive communications and
information services.  It's certainly the first time I've ever heard
someone say that 21 or even 9 million people is not a mass market.
Who's talking about doing so?  Companies are *fighting* to put in data
services right now; why should this stop?  The issue is one of access and
expense, not of will it happen or not.
What evidence have you that fact that the absence of basic service
regulation was the source of growth in the cable industry, particularly
when other heavily restrictive regulation was affecting it, and preventing
it from being a free market?
These are not logically comparable categories.  Coax cable, as a conduit,
is certainly better than phone wire.  But why should it be better for
cable companies to offer voice and video services?  I'd think the evidence
points in the other direction.  Cable programming has heretofore been 80
or whatever channels of one-way garbage.  At least telephone communication
is 2 way, relatively private, uncensored, and can be used to reach online
services with many-to-many information exchange.  TCI may say they want to
bring that about via "CableNet" too, but I wouldn't hold my breath if I
were you.
No, clear proof that people wanted cable tv. Period.  No more, no less.
Until I see an attempt to bring data (which should not require any new
cabling for a while) to everyone, and see the people from the service
providers being told to beat it and being chased off with brooms by
enraged renters and homeowners, I feel fairly confident that there is a
very worthwhile market for data services, and that at very least it would
be a far more worthwhile experiment that cable ever was.  Seems funny that
you claim that free market theory would yield this 90%, when the cable
"market" is not much of a market at all, but simply a collection of
govt-supported local monopolies.
There are good points, but I still question whether cable (or any other
form of) tv has any business being a "basic service".  Personally I find
tv to be a basic disservice and an utter waste of time (others probably
disagree, but oh well.)  What rationale is there for including it with
POTS as something to be subsidized?  If you firmly believe that govt.
subsidization/regulation will harm a medium, then say so.  But as it
stands I get the feeling that you think it will be good for the provision
of "basic services"; but when challenged you point to the good that
comes from *lack* of regulation.  Which is it?  If the govt. *does* need to
subsidize [useful service X] because it should be a basic service, then
let's see data included.  If subsidization (and the regulation that comes
with it) are lousy and screw up the market, then let's not see *anything*
subsidized (unless we actually want to damage it; might be a good idea for
tv >;)

Recognizing that in the very rapidly unfolding "data highway" plan (if
anything this chaotic and free-for-all can be called a "plan"), the
govt WILL play one role or another, like it or not, is not joining the
govt's clientele.  Much as I'd like to see no govt. involvement, it is
inevitable in the current socio-political climate. 5 EFFs could pop up,
with twice our funding each, and all scream bloody murder about govt
involvement in the "national information infrastructure", and all 5 of
them would be utterly ignored.  Working more carefully, rather that
pursuing an all out barrage, can be more effective in some cases, and we
think this to be one of them.
I think it's wise to look at the realities of the situation, whatever
one's outlook whether libertarian or otherwise, and recognize that
sometimes unpleasant things like an unwieldy state simply have to be dealt
with.  Whether govt involvement is wrong or not is really irrelevant,
until cp tech, and cp/libertarian attitudes are in a position to DO
something about it.  It's like being confronted by a mugger: you can point
out that they have no right to rob you and are using coercive force to
violate your civil liberties, but it's not going to make them go away if
you don't have the physical power to defend yourself.
The time's just not right for a cypherpunk "War on Govt".  Cypherpunks will
lose. As the NII is coming on fast, the govt has to be dealt with NOW, to
reduce their impact and involvement, rather than hope that, w/o DigiCash,
w/o a large base of support in the culture at large, w/o our own
infrastructure, CPs will convince the govt to just give up and go away. They'll trample that idea into the dirt, because they have the money and
power to do so, right or wrong, and you'd end up with a net.fcc and 5000
channels of crud, metered out byte by byte, requirements for a net.license
to be a provider rather than consumer, and taxed into oblivion.  I'd like
to point out also that it's much easier to prevent large scale govt
involvement and reduce small scale involvement later, that fight against
ANY govt involvement, lose, and a be faced with trying to get rid of it
later after it's become law and granted the govt all sorts of powers.  Try
to eliminate the FCC.  Good luck!  This stance does of course presume
vigilance to prevent the govt from expanding their small base of power
into a bigger one.
I look forward to seeing the power of the govt wane in coming years, and I
am certain that it will happen, but I don't think it's going to happen
this month, or next year.  When we've got a DigiCash-based banking system,
when the majority of the population are computer-literate, when
cryptography is fully legal and unstigmatized, when CP tech is easy to use
for the non-techie and built in to applications and hardware, when
anti-authoritarianism returns as the focus of the country's political
thought, and when the govt begins to collapse under the weight of it's own
failures, then we'll see the changes come.  But, I tend to expect that
things will get worse before they get better, in the big picture. People
aren't mad enough yet to get up off their commercial-brainwashed,
apathetic couch potato butts and DO much of anything yet, but would rather
go to the mall or play with their Game Boys.  "Give Me Convenience or Give
Me Death" as Jello Biafra mocked.
Have a look at the stuff EFF's doing - to reduce/eliminate ITAR restrictions,
to combat unjust laws, to defend people who's civil liberties have been
violated by "law enforcement" that doesn't even seem to know what the law
is, to educate about privacy and encryption, to make using the internet
easy for "Big Dummies", to encourage grassroots real-world networking on
the local level, and to ensure that whatever the "superhighway" will be,
it provides for full-bandwidth, open platform, and openly accessible
many-to-many participation - before tossing us on the garbage heap as govt
lubbers. :)  I don't think anyone here LIKES the idea that we have to
haggle and play the game w/the govt, but that's just the way it stands,
and any step that reduces govt interference in any way even if it doesn't
bring on the glorious anarcho-capitalist revolution, is still a step in

Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee Chairman Edward Markey
(D-Mass.), Minority Chairman Jack Fields (R-Tex.), and other cosponsors for
introducing the "National Communications Competition and Information

Chairman, stated:  "The sponsors of this bill are to be commended for
proposing legislation that incorporates a truly democratic vision of the
emerging data highway.  Open platform service can end channel scarcity once
and for all and make it possible for any information provider to offer
voice, data, and video services on the data highway.  Every citizen will be
able to access a true diversity of information and programming."

        Under the Markey/Fields bill, open platform service is designed to
give residential subscribers access to voice, data, and video digital
telephone service on a switched, end-to-end basis.  Information of the

customer.         The bill directs the Federal Communications Commission to

affordable rates.  To ensure affordability, open platform service would be
tariffed at reasonable rates. ENTRY OF TELEPHONE COMPANIES INTO VIDEO CABLE SERVICE
        The bill promotes the entry of telephone companies into video cable
service and seeks to benefit consumers by spurring competition in the local
telephone and cable television industries. The bill envisions that
telephone companies, cable companies, and others will be interconnected and
have equal access to facilities of the local telephone companies.  The bill
would rescind the ban on telephone company ownership and delivery of video
programming that was enacted in the Cable Act of 1984.  Telephone companies
would be allowed to provide video programming, through a separate
subsidiary, to subscribers in its telephone service area.         Telephone companies would be required to establish a "video
platform" upon which to offer their video programming.  Telephone
companies, on a nondiscriminatory basis, would be required to allow other
providers to offer video programming to subscribers using the same video
platform.  Other providers would be allowed to use up to 75 percent of the
video platform capacity.  Telephone companies would be prohibited from
buying cable systems within their telephone service territory, with only
tightly drawn exceptions.  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
would be required to establish rules for compensating local telephone
companies for providing interconnection and equal access.
UNIVERSAL SERVICE
        To ensure that universal digital services are available to
residential subscribers at affordable rates as local telephone service
becomes more competitive, the Markey/Fields bill would establish a joint
Federal-State Board to perpetuate universal provision of high-quality
telephone service.  The Board would be required to define the nature and
extent of the services encompassed within a telephone company's universal
service obligation.  The Board also would be charged with promoting access
to advanced telecommunications technology.
        The FCC is required to prescribe standards necessary to ensure that
advances in network capabilities and services deployed by common carriers
are designed to be accessible to individuals with disabilities, unless an
undue burden is posed by such requirements.  Additionally, within one year
of enactment, the bill requires the FCC to initiate an inquiry to examine
the effects of competition in the provision of both telephone exchange
access and telephone exchange service furnished by rural carriers.

case you don't already have it:
This is the Cypherwonks mailing list
Below is The Cypherwonk Charter, by L. Detweiler, Cypherwonk Janitor
The cypherwonks are a splinter group from the cypherpunks also
interested in promoting and implementing cryptographic technology.
However, we have unique ideas on how to successfully implement these
radical new capabilities to ensure privacy without encouraging criminal
behaviors like forgery and `online predation'. We are also interested
in a far more ambitious goal of `technological progress' that
transcends a mere obsession with privacy and anonymity. The cypherwonks
believe that many aspects of a identification and government are
necessary and crucial for any social stability (particularly related to
judicial and law enforcement systems), and are quite alarmed at talk
about a `cryptoanarchy' resulting from the mere implementation of
software protocols -- although we realize that radical new forms of
government may appear with these new technologies, embodied in one term
`Electronic Democracy'.
We believe that while sometimes the `majority' can become a `tyranny',
in general the idea of voting as a civilized way of resolving proposals
and `one person, one vote' are sacred, and we are interested in
implementing systems that promote interaction and collaboration among
motivated and enthusiastic members, whether within the cypherwonk
organization or within their nations (cypherwonks, of course, try to
think free of local prejudices, and globally).
Cypherwonks understand that *trust* and *honesty* are inherent in all
human endeavors, *particularly* communication. We recognize that people
trust others not to reveal our private email unless given permission,
we trust others not to use information from our mail or about their
identities to adverse aims, we trust that systems delivering mail will
not be corrupted by criminals, or if they get caught there will be
serious consequences, and many other explicit and implicit variations.
We know that there are many ingenious ways of minimizing the amount of
trust required in unknown components such as with the use of
cryptography or pseudonyms, and we seek passionately to invent and use
them, but at the root level, email is an exchange between human beings
who trust each other. Therefore, we hold a sense of ethics and morality
in strong reverence, and even though we're not always precisely sure
what they entail, we know that they exist and we strive for the right
ideal. We abhor the idea that `it's not wrong if you can get away with
it' or other variations of moral relativism.
Cypherwonks are also extremely interested in promoting and implementing
`digital cash', but believe that while invariably the state's taxes
tend to become burdensome, few civilized, technological societies are
free of them, and certainly we do not advocate tax evasion, `black
marketeering', or any other subversive or illegal activities through
cryptographic techniques, and even beyond this we seek design protocols
that discourage these subversive aims in general, because of their
toxic, fragmentary effect on social unity.
Cypherwonks recognize that our mailing list is extremely critical in
coordinating our movement and our fellow members. It is our central
nervous system. While the list is informal, we demand a professional
atmosphere, and will privately object to people who are publicly rude
or belligerent. But we are also extremely careful about what we say to
each other in private, because people can be extremely influenced by
what they receive in mail. We would be aghast and horrified to find
that somebody viciously criticized someone in private mail based on
public postings, for example. We place high value on being courteous to
each other and minimizing disagreement where possible, forging
consensus, and the art of diplomacy in surmounting political barriers.
We trust each other on the list and in personal email. We wish to have
an open, uplifting, inspiring, honest, representative, polite,
respectful, egalitarian dialogue. We will never use the mailing list
for personal or selfish reasons -- we strive to serve our fellow
cypherwonks through our postings. We are what we claim to be. We abhor
secrecy, `security through obscurity', and conspirational cliques.
Cypherwonks are extremely interested in promoting some forms of
anonymity. However, we do not necessarily believe that others are
required to read anonymous postings. To the contrary, we believe that
the individual should have the tools and freedom to filter his or her
own mail based on real identities. In particular, we condemn the
practice of `pseudospoofing,' the dangerous deception where a person
builds up a pseudonym and misrepresents it as being that of a real
person's identity. We police each other on the list to prevent it, and
require a promise that our members refrain from it. While our trust can
be betrayed, only those that are honest are true cypherwonks, and
anyone who betrays our trust we consider a dishonist hypocrite, or worse, a tra
  *itor.
Cypherwonks are extremely interested in building tangible systems.
Engineers who love to discuss the nitty-gritty details of some scheme
are at home on the cypherwonks list. We like to impress each other with
our knowledge but at the same time state it in relevant and humble
terms. We are not trying to win popularity contests with our postings.
We are trying to accomplish ambitious endeavors. We are especially
ecstatic to make connections with other cypherwonks interested in the
same projects we are, and cooperating to build useful tools. We like to
give status reports of our intermittent real-world meetings and

NOTICE: This is the letter from the Digital Privacy and Security Working
Group sent to the White House 12/06/93, urging the Administration to lift
export controls on DES, RSA and other mass market encryption without
requring legislation.
Some erroneous press reports have said the DPSWG (see letter
signatories) were making a Clipper/Skipjack "deal". This is not true. The letter makes it clear that Clipper as originally proposed is not
viable, and that in any form it is to be implemented only if it's use is
completely voluntary and ONLY if current restrictions on mass market
encryption software are removed, so that the right to choose one's own
methods of privacy and security is retained, and American businesses can
effectively and openly compete in the expanding international market for
encryption products.

@_subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: EFF Statement on Cryptography & Policy 
EFF ANNOUNCES ITS OFFICIAL POLICY ON CRYPTOGRAPHY AND PRIVACY
        Strongly opposes original Clipper/Skipjack plan,
        reiterates the need to lift restrictions on encryption
December 8, 1993
The Electronic Frontier Foundation is pleased to announce its
formal policy on encryption.
This is particularly timely, because yesterday the New York Times
announced that the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group had
proposed to trade support for the administration's proposed Clipper
Chip for a lifting of the long-standing export embargo on robust
domestic encryption.
This was a misunderstanding of what the DPSWG offered the
administration in this proposal, leading to the belief that both the
DPSWG (a coalition of over 50 computer, communications, and privacy
organizations and associations) and it's principal coordinating
organization, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, have offered to ease
their opposition to Clipper.
We see it as a pragmatic effort to get the government to wiggle on
these issues: one step in the right direction, with many more to
follow.  This step is that we insist that use of Clipper and key
escrow must be completely voluntary.  It's not voluntary if users of
the Skipjack algorithm are forced to use key escrow.  It's not
voluntary if users who do choose escrow are forced to use the
government's choice of escrow agents.  It's not voluntary if
manufacturers such as AT&T are pressured into withdrawing competing
products.  It's not voluntary when competing products can't be sold in
a worldwide market.  It's not voluntary if the public can't see the
algorithm they are "volunteering" to use.  It's not voluntary if the
government will require anyone to use Skipjack or escrow, even when
communicating with the government.
The Working Group chose to state this in a diplomatic fashion by
applauding "repeated statements by Administration officials that there
is no intent to make the clipper chip mandatory".  They were diplomatic
for two reasons.  First, they believe the Administration has gotten this
message.  Clipper was announced in April and was supposed to be
available in the Summer.  It is December, the escrow system is still
uncertain, and the Administration is still drafting a report which was
due in July.  If they still don't get it, the coalition has a 100 page
white paper documenting the case against clipper and the case for
lifting export controls, which they will release in response to any
Administration position favoring Clipper.
The second reason is that the coalition was trying to use the
introduction of the Rep. Cantwell's bill eliminating many export
controls on crypto to try, one more time, to urge the Administration
to make voluntariness meaningful by unilaterally lifting export
controls.  Even if the Working Group and the Administration can't
agree on Clipper, EFF and the Working Group needed to continue
pressing the export issue.
But NSA is digging in, and a legislative fight looks more likely.
If diplomacy fails, EFF must fight for our rights.  Thus, we are
going to need all the allies we can find, from IBM, Apple, Lotus,
and Sun, to cryptographers, cypherpunks, and folks on the net.
EFF wants the public and the Administration to know (as we have
frequently stated to them face to face) that the Electronic Frontier
Foundation would fight to the end any attempt by the Administration to
do any more than let companies use Clipper if they want and to let people
buy it if they want -- and only in a market which has other strong
encryption schemes available because export controls have been lifted.
Under truly voluntary conditions, the EFF would be proud to say, "We
have expressed ... tentative acceptance of the Clipper Chip's
encryption scheme ... only if it is available as a voluntary
alternative to widely-available, commercially-accepted encryption
programs and products."  We would applaud the Government for employing
NSA's substantial expertise to devise improved encryption schemes --
like DES and Skipjack -- and deploying them to improve our society's
privacy and security.
We hope that the Clinton Administration can agree to take this single
step.  Here is the whole journey we'd like to begin.  If you share our
path, we need your help and support -- please join EFF.  Send the end of this document for details.
        Electronic Frontier Foundation Policy on Cryptography & Privacy
        (Approved November 11, 1993)
Digital technology is rapidly rendering our commercial activities and
communications -- indeed, much of our personal lives -- open to scrutiny by
strangers. Our medical records, political opinions, personal financial
transactions, and intimate affairs now pass over digital networks where
governments, employers, insurance companies, business competitors, and
others who might turn our private lives against us can examine them with
increasing ease and detail.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation believes that Americans must be allowed
access to the cryptographic tools necessary to protect their own privacy.
We will work toward making the following principles the official policies
of the U. S. Government:
1.      Private access to cryptography must be unhindered:
   *    There must be no laws restricting domestic use of cryptography.
   *    There must be no restrictions on the export of products, services,
or information because they contain cryptographic algorithms.
2.      Cryptography policy and technical standards must be set in open,
public forums:
   *    All participants in the policy debate on these issues, particularly
law enforcement and national security agencies, must submit their arguments
to public scrutiny.
   *    Any civilian encryption standard must be published and exposed to
rigorous public challenge.
3.      Encryption must become a part of the information infrastructure to
provide security, to protect privacy, and to provide each individual
control over his or her own identity.
   *    Each user must be free to choose whether or not to use key escrow,
and who should have copies of their keys, if anyone.
   *    Government at all levels should explore cryptography's potential to
replace identity-based or dossier-based systems, such as driver's licenses,
credit cards, checks, and passports with less invasive technology.
4.      New technologies must not erode constitutional protections,
particularly the right to speak, publish, and assemble, and to be free from
unreasonable searches and seizures .
   *    There must be no broadening of governmental access to private
communications and records, through wiretap law or otherwise, unless there
is a public consensus that the risks to safety outweigh the risks to
liberty and that our safety will actually be increased by the broadened
                                ***
The Electronic Frontier Foundation recognizes that the combination of
digital communications and encryption technology does indeed threaten
some of law enforcement's current investigative techniques.
We also recognize that encryption will prevent many of the online
crimes that will likely occur without it.  We further believe that
these technologies will create new investigative tools for law
enforcement, even as they obsolete old ones.  Entering this new
environment, private industry, law enforcement, and private citizens
must work together to balance the requirements of both liberty and
security.  But technology halts for no one, not even the law.

@_subject: ALERT: FBI's Wiretap Bill is Back! 
Digital Telephony Threat Returns
According to FBI Dir. Louis Freeh, the development of sophisticated digital
telecom and networking technology threatens the ability of the Feds to
wiretap.  In a Dec. 8 speech at Washington's National Press Club, Freeh
annouced a renewal of the FBI's 'Digital Telephony' legislation scheme:
the return of the controverial 'Wiretap Bill'.  The bill is strongly
opposed by organizations and individuals concerned about privacy, as well
as the telecommunications and computing industries at large.  The FBI's
'need' for this legislative action is under review by the Administration
as part of it's examination of security and encryption issues.
The reappearance of this Bureau effort contradicts statements by Special
Agent Barry Smith of the FBI's Congressional Affairs Office, who stated
less than a month ago that the 'Wiretap Bill' had been tabled.
According to classified documents released under the Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA), the FBI and the Electronic Communications Service
Provider Committee or ECSPC (an ad hoc industry working group, which
formed in March), are attempting to decide if technical solutions can
be found to satisify law enforcement. According to a Nynex representative
co-chairing the group, Kenneth Raymond, no solution has yet been found, but
that FBI has yet to prove any solution is needed at all.  Raymond likened
Freeh's tactics to "yelling out the window" - an attention-getting move
that needs some sort of clarifying followup.
Though the ECSPC claims to be attempting to evaluate the problem and to
solve it "in some reasonable way that is consistent with cost and demand",
Raymond indicated that the group considers one 'solution' to be building
wiretap access into future telecom hardware - like the  Clipper chip
backdoor, but a 'feature' of all switch specifications for phone and data
This news was just received, and a more detailed analysis and statement
from EFF will follow soon.

asked to do so, and before the cops even knew an alleged crime had or
would occur.
Just so.
I think the crypto-anarchists among us would say that's the nature of the
beast.  I honestly think most of the 'law and order' rhetoric is
heartfelt.  I'm pretty sure that most control-freaks really do believe
they are doing it 'for your own good', and see themselves as knights in
shining armor.  I guess I've just never had much faith in conspiracy
theories.  This is not to say such people are to be trusted, however.
Two old sayings come to mind here: never ascribe to malice what can be
adequately explained by stupidity or ignorance; and, if you ever meet
someone who says they want to 'protect' you or want to do something 'for
your own good', run away as fast as possible - this person is dangerous.

         Electronic Frontier Foundation - Austin (EFF-Austin)
          EFF-Austin was formed to protect constitutional guarantees of free
          speech and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure for
          users of computer networks. Experience has taught us that these
          freedoms must be fought for if they are to survive in the online
          world.  EFF-Austin was created as an experimental local chapter of
          the national EFF but became independent in 1993 while retaining
          contacts with the parent organization. We're heavily involved
          in public speaking, education, and advocacy of constitutional
          rights in cyberspace. We're Austin's forum for discussion of all
          concerns related to the cutting edge where society meets technology.

           The Cypherpunks mailing lists exist for those interested in
           cryptography and it's political rammifications, programming
           encryption software, creation of digital cash and electronic
           banking via secure (and anonymous) crypto tech, local crypto-
           oriented activism, hacking cypher hardware, and more.  There
           also tends to be much libertarian/anarcho-capitalist
           debate as well.  The main list is VERY high-traffic.  The
           UK branch generally goes by the name of UK Crypto-Privacy Assoc.
           The CypherWonks list is a split-off that is generally opposed to
           the anarchic stance of some on the main list.  There are also

@_subject: Brock Meeks summary of Gore speech 
[This report from Brock Meeks first appeared on the WELL, and is
redistributed with permission.  Further redistribution/republication
should be cleared with the author first, at brock
__________ begin forward _____________
 Jacking in from the Policy port:
 Vice President Gore today outlined the Administration's plan for
 revamping the regulatory regime that will guide the converging
 telecommunications industry into the next century.
 Gore said the Administration will propose lifting all
 restrictions on local telephone companies imposed during the
 breakup of AT&T, allowing them to enter the long distance and
 manufacturing markets.
 But buried deep in his speech, in a single ominous sentence, Gore
 made a pledge that is sure to a chill into privacy advocates
 everywhere: "We'll help law enforcement agencies thwart criminals
 and terrorists who might use advanced telecommunications to
 commit crimes."  In laymen's terms:  We're fucked.
 Gore didn't elaborate on his statement, but his comment hinted
 that the White House will throw its full behind two of the most
 controversial policies the Clinton Administration inherited from
 the Bush presidency:  The FBI Digital Wiretap Proposal and the
 so-called "Clipper Chip," government mandated encryption program.
 Both policies have been publicly trashed by the computer and
 telecommunications industry as well as civil liberty groups.
 The White House is currently working to overhaul the entire U.S.
 security policy.  Earlier this year, in a little noticed speech,
 FBI Dir. Freeh renewed his push for the ill-conceived Digital
 Wiretap proposal.  It now appears that the White House will
 back that proposal when it issues new security guidelines due
 sometime in the Summer.
 Changing the Playing Field
 ==========================
 Gore also challenged the nation to bring every classroom and
 library online by the year 2000. He outlined 5 broad principles
 for restructuring the telecommunications industry, leading to a
 National Information Infrastructure:
 -- Encourage private investment
 -- Provide and protect competition
 -- Provide open access to the network
 -- Avoid creating information "haves" and "have nots"
 -- Encourage flexible and responsive government action
 Gore said the Administration's plan would "clear from the road
 the wreckage of outdated regulations and allow a free-flowing
 traffic of ideas and commerce."  Administration plan would allow
 telephone companies to get into cable business and let cable
 companies into the telephone business, preempting state
 regulations that for the most part ban such businesses.
 Although the White House plan allows local telephone companies to
 provide video, they must also allow any programmer access to
 those video delivery systems on nondiscriminatory basis.  The
 plan also seeks to stop telephone companies from buying cable
 systems in the areas where they offer telephone service.  But the
 plan also gives the FCC the authority to revamp that rule within
 5 years if "sufficient competition" has risen.
 The plan also would implement a new flexible regulatory regime
 called Title VII that encourages firms to provide broadband,
 switched digital transmission services.  Like the Cable
 reregulation act, the FCC will have the ability to provide for
 rate regulation on these new companies until "competition is
 established."
 One of the trickiest issues facing the Administration was how to
 define and ensure the concept of Universal Service.  The White
 House plan proposes to make that policy "an explicit objective
 the Communications Act" in order to make sure that advanced
 information services are available to rural and low-income urban
 areas.  But the Administration bailed on how to insure the
 concept, opting to lay that burden at the feet of the FCC.  Also,
 all telecommunications providers, not merely telephone companies
 as is the current policy, will have to start contributing to
 universal access subsidies.  But the FCC will be responsible for
 determining a kind of "sliding scale" for how much each company
 will be required to pay.
 In fact, if smaller firms can't pony up the cash to help out with
 the universal service commitment, they can make "in-kind"
 contributions instead.  This might be in the form of free service
 to school, hospitals, etc.

@_subject: White House crypto briefings: Clipper, FIPS, escrow agents, export 
Briefings on Federal Encryption Policy/Telecommunications Security
Today (Feb 4), the Administration will hold 2 briefings about cryptography
and the Clipper chip.  The briefings will "report on a review of federal
policies and procedures for encryption and telecommunications
security-related products and technologies."
The first briefing, at 11am EST (i.e., in less that half an hour of this
posting), will update Congressional committee staff, and the second will
address concerns of industry reps, public interest groups, privacy
advocates and other non-government parties.  EFF will attend this second
meeting, at 1pm EST.
EFF will share what it learns about the results of either briefing
as soon as possible.  An early "heads up" from the the Administration indicates that the main
subjects for the briefings will be:
        Administration will announce Clipper/Skipjack Federal Information
          Processing Standard (FIPS)
        Justice Dept. key escrow procedures to be announced
        Announcement of Treasury and NIST as Escrow Agents
        Decisions on encrytion products that fit under current export
          standards announced.
Other topics also likely to be addressed (unconfirmed):
        State Dept. will, surprisingly, streamline procedures for           export of Clipper
        Administration not going forward with DSS licensing agreement
          with PKP/RSADSI.

@_subject: NIST - PKP settlements not over yet 
[from Gregory Aharonian's Internet Patent News Service]
A hostile response to a tentative agreement to settle a patent dispute
over the proposed Digital Signature Standard has forced the National Institute
of Standards and Technology to return to negotiations.  Last summer, NIST
officials thought they finally settled the DSS public key patent dispute by
granting Public Key Partners (PKP) of Sunnyvale, California, an exclusive
worldwide license for the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) on which the DSS
is built.
In exchange for sublicensing rights, the PKP group agreed to endorse
NIST's DSS proposal.  But F. Lynn McNulty, associate director for computer
security with NIST's Computer System Laboratory, said a majority of potential
DSS users balked at the deal.  NIST published the settlement terms for
comment, and McNulty said all but 10 of the 270 comments were critical.
[as many of you may remember, EFF coordinated the transmission of these
comments to NIST, who did not widely announce the request for comment at all.
The uncharitable might call that an attempt to sweep the matter under the rug.
The naive might call it an oversight.  At any rate almost all of the comments
NIST received were routed via EFF, who were happy to publicize it "for" NIST.]
Many DSS critics have argued that another algorithm promulgated by RSA
Data Security (Redwood City, CA), is a de facto industry digital signature
standard and that it would cost too much to comply with a separate government
Now NIST is attempting to hammer out a new settlement based on the
comments, McNulty said.  "The real hang-up continues to be the patent issue",
McNulty said.  "We're still trying to resolve it".
Scientists at CSL designed the CSS to serve as a standard agency tool for
verifying the senders and contents of messages transmitted electronically.
CSL also prescribed the public key Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA).
But PKP, which holds the rights to public key patents on behalf of
Stanford University, MIT, and most recently, German professor Claus Schnorr,
charged that CSL's proposed algorithm infringed upon these patents.  NIST
originally sponsored DSA research, and agencies are exempt from any licensing
fees.  PKP, however, has maintained that vendors that incorporate the
standard into their products should pay royalties.

@_subject: FLASH: Vice President Gore Questions Current Key Escrow Policy! 
National Information Infrastructure Advisory Committee met today in
Washington at the Old Executive Office Building.  In comments made after a
question and answer period,  Vice President Al Gore said that key escrow
policy announced last Friday (2/4/94) had serious flaws and that he hope
the issue of who holds the keys and under what terms would be given more
serious, careful consideration.  Gore made it clear that some amount of control of cryptography technology
was necessary for national security.  However, the key escrow policies
announced by the Departments of Justice, Commerce & State, and the NSA,
were "low level decisions" that got out before thorough analysis.  In a
conversation with Mitchell Kapor, Esther Dyson, and Mike Nelson (of the
White House Staff), Gore said that he would prefer that the keys be held by
some part of the Judiciary branch, or perhaps even by trusted, private
escrow agents.  He made it clear that he believed that the escrow agents
named in last Friday's announcement (National Institute of Standards &
Technology and the Treasure Department) were no appropriate key holders. Mike Nelson also indicated that there was real interest in a software-based
escrow system instead of the hardware-based SKIPJACK standard
Those of us who heard Gore were quite surprised.  His remarks suggest that
the key escrow policies to date do not have full support of the White
Still, Gore was quite firm in asserting that some control of encryption
technology is essential to national security.  "Encryption and codebreaking
have determined the outcome of world wars.  He stated (incorrectly) that
most our industrialized allies place must stricter controls in encryption
that the US does.  In fact, almost all COCOM countries allow the export of
DES-based products, though some do not allow DES to be imported.
The whole question of encryption was raised when Mitchell Kapor told the
Vice President that over half of the Advisory Council members had serious
reservations about the current Clipper/Skipjack policies.  Gore and Kapor
agreed that the Advisory Council should be used to have a serious dialogue
about encryption policy.  Given Gore's departure from the current Clipper
proposals, there might actually be something to talk about.
NOTE: This DOES NOT mean that Clipper is going away.  Part of stopping
Clipper is to lift export controls on encryption and enable US companies to
start producing products that enable all of us to protect our privacy with
strong encryption.

On January 11, I managed to schmooze myself aboard Air Force 2. It was flying out of LA, where its principal passenger had just outlined his vision of the information superhighway to a suited mob of television, show-
biz, and cable types who  fervently hoped to own it one day - if they could ever figure out what the hell it was.
From the standpoint of the Electronic Frontier Foundation the speech had been wildly encouraging. The administration's program, as announced by Vice President Al Gore, incorporated many of the concepts of open competition, universal access, and  deregulated common carriage that we'd been pushing for the previous year.
But he had said nothing about the future of privacy, except to cite among the bounties of the NII its ability to "help law enforcement agencies thwart criminals and terrorists who might use advanced telecommunications to commit crimes."
On the plane I asked Gore what this implied about administration policy on cryptography. He became as noncommittal as a cigar-store Indian. "We'll be making some announcements.... I can't tell you anything more." He hurried to the front of the  plane, leaving me to troubled speculation.
Despite its fundamental role in assuring privacy, transaction security, and reliable identity within the NII, the Clinton administration has not demonstrated an enlightenment about cryptography up to par with the rest of its digital vision.
The Clipper Chip - which threatens to be either the goofiest waste of federal dollars since President Gerald Ford's great Swine Flu program or, if actually deployed, a surveillance technology of profound malignancy - seemed at first an ugly legacy  of the Reagan-Bush modus operandi. "This is going to be our Bay of Pigs," one Clinton White House official told me at the time Clipper was introduced, referring to the disastrous plan to invade Cuba that Kennedy inherited from Eisenhower.
(Clipper, in case you're just tuning in, is an encryption chip that the National Security Agency and FBI hope will someday be in every phone and computer in America. It scrambles your communications, making them unintelligible to all but their  intended recipients. All, that is, but the government, which would hold the "key" to your chip. The key would separated into two pieces, held in escrow, and joined with the appropriate "legal authority.")
Of course, trusting the government with your privacy is like having a Peeping Tom install your window blinds. And, since the folks I've met in this White House seem like extremely smart, conscious freedom-lovers - hell, a lot of them are Deadheads -  I was sure that after they were fully moved in, they'd face down the National Security Agency and the FBI, let Clipper die a natural death, and lower the export embargo on reliable encryption products.
Furthermore, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology and the National Security Council have been studying both Clipper and export embargoes since April. Given that the volumes of expert testimony they had collected overwhelmingly opposed  both, I expected the final report would give the administration all the support it needed to do the right thing.
I was wrong. Instead, there would be no report. Apparently, they couldn't draft one that supported, on the evidence, what they had decided to do THE OTHER SHOE DROPS
On Friday, February 4, the other jackboot dropped. A series of announcements from the administration made it clear that cryptography would become their very own "Bosnia of telecommunications" (as one staffer put it). It wasn't just that the old  Serbs in the National Security Agency and the FBI were still making the calls. The alarming new reality was that the invertebrates in the White House were only too happy to abide by them. Anything to avoid appearing soft on drugs or terrorism.
So, rather than ditching Clipper, they declared it a Federal Data Processing Standard, backing that up with an immediate government order for 50,000 Clipper devices. They appointed the National Institutes of Standards and Technology and the  Department of Treasury as the "trusted" third parties that would hold the Clipper key pairs. (Treasury, by the way, is also home to such trustworthy agencies as the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.)
They reaffirmed the export embargo on robust encryption products, admitting for the first time that its purpose was to stifle competition to Clipper. And they outlined a very porous set of requirements under which the cops might get the keys to your  chip. (They would not go into the procedure by which the National Security Agency could get them, though they assured us it was sufficient.)
They even signaled the impending return of the dread Digital Telephony, an FBI legislative initiative requiring fundamental reengineering of the information infrastructure; providing wiretapping ability to the FBI would then become the paramount  design priority.
INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS
Actually, by the time the announcements thudded down, I wasn't surprised by them. I had spent several days the previous week in and around the White I felt like I was in another remake of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers. My friends in the administration had been transformed. They'd been subsumed by the vast mindfield on the other side of the security clearance membrane, where dwell the  monstrous bureaucratic organisms that feed on fear. They'd been infected by the institutionally paranoid National Security Agency's They used all the telltale phrases. Mike Nelson, the White House point man on the NII, told me, "If only I could tell you what I know, you'd feel the same way I do." I told him I'd been inoculated against that argument during Vietnam. (And it does  seem to me that if you're going to initiate a process that might end freedom in America, you probably need an argument that isn't classified.)
Besides, how does he know what he knows? Where does he get his information? Why, the National Security Agency, of course. Which, given its strong interest in the outcome, seems hardly an unimpeachable source.
However they reached it, Clinton and Gore have an astonishingly simple bottom line, to which even the future of American liberty and prosperity is secondary: They believe that it is their responsibility to eliminate, by whatever means, the  possibility that some terrorist might get a nuke and use it on, say, the World Trade Center. They have been convinced that such plots are more likely to ripen to hideous fruition behind a shield of The staffers I talked to were unmoved by the argument that anyone smart enough to steal a nuclear device is probably smart enough to use PGP or some other uncompromised crypto standard. And never mind that the last people who popped a hooter in the  World Trade Center were able to get it there without using any cryptography and while under FBI surveillance.
We are dealing with religion here. Though only ten American lives have been lost to terrorism in the last two years, the primacy of this threat has become as much an article of faith with these guys as the Catholic conviction that human life begins  at conception or the Mormon belief that the Lost Tribe of Israel crossed the Atlantic in submarines.
In the spirit of openness and compromise, they invited the Electronic Frontier Foundation to submit other solutions to the "problem" of the nuclear-enabled terrorist than key escrow devices, but they would not admit into discussion the argument that  such a threat might, in fact, be some kind of phantasm created by the spooks to ensure their lavish budgets into the post-Cold War era.
As to the possibility that good old-fashioned investigative techniques might be more valuable in preventing their show-case catastrophe (as it was after the fact in finding the alleged perpetrators of the last attack on the World Trade Center), they  just hunkered down and said that when wiretaps were necessary, they were damned well necessary.
When I asked about the business that American companies lose because of their inability to export good encryption products, one staffer essentially dismissed the market, saying that total world trade in crypto goods was still less than a billion  dollars. (Well, right. Thanks more to the diligent efforts of the National Security Agency than to dim sales I suggested that a more immediate and costly real-world effect of their policies would be to reduce national security by isolating American commerce, owing to a lack of international confidence in the security of our data lines. I said that Bruce  Sterling's fictional data-enclaves in places like the Turks and Caicos Islands were starting to look real-world They had a couple of answers to this, one unsatisfying and the other scary. The unsatisfying answer was that the international banking community could just go on using DES, which still seemed robust enough to them. (DES is the old federal Data  Encryption Standard, thought by most cryptologists to be nearing the end of its credibility.)
More frightening was their willingness to counter the data-enclave future with one in which no data channels anywhere would be secure from examination by one government or another. Pointing to unnamed other countries that were developing their own  mandatory standards and restrictions regarding cryptography, they said words to the effect of, "Hey, it's not like you can't outlaw the stuff. Look at France."
Of course, they have also said repeatedly - and for now I believe them - that they have absolutely no plans to outlaw non-Clipper crypto in the US. But that doesn't mean that such plans wouldn't develop in the presence of some pending "emergency."  Then there is that White House briefing document, issued at the time Clipper was first announced, which asserts that no US citizen "as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product."
Now why, if it's an ability they have no intention of contesting, do they feel compelled to declare that it's not a right? Could it be that they are preparing us for the laws they'll pass after some bearded fanatic has gotten himself a surplus nuke  and used something besides Clipper to conceal his plans for it?
If they are thinking about such an eventuality, we should be doing so as well. How will we respond? I believe there is a strong, though currently untested, argument that outlawing unregulated crypto would violate the First Amendment, which surely  protects the manner of our speech as clearly as it protects the content.
But of course the First Amendment is, like the rest of the Constitution, only as good as the government's willingness to uphold it. And they are, as I say, in the mood to protect our safety over our liberty.
This is not a mind-frame against which any argument is going to be very effective. And it appeared that they had already heard and rejected every argument I could possibly offer.
In fact, when I drew what I thought was an original comparison between their stand against naturally proliferating crypto and the folly of King Canute (who placed his throne on the beach and commanded the tide to leave him dry), my government  opposition looked pained and said he had heard that one almost as often as jokes about roadkill on the information I hate to go to war with them. War is always nastier among friends. Furthermore, unless they've decided to let the National Security Agency design the rest of the National Information Infrastructure as well, we need to go on working closely with  them on the whole range of issues like access, competition, workplace privacy, common carriage, intellectual property, and such. Besides, the proliferation of strong crypto will probably happen eventually no matter what they do.
But then again, it might not. In which case we could shortly find ourselves under a government that would have the automated ability to log the time, origin and recipient of every call we made, could track our physical whereabouts continuously,  could keep better account of our financial transactions than we do, and all without a warrant. Talk about crime Worse, under some vaguely defined and surely mutable "legal authority," they also would be able to listen to our calls and read our e-mail without having to do any backyard rewiring. They wouldn't need any permission at all to monitor overseas calls.
If there's going to be a fight, I'd rather it be with this government than the one we'd likely face on that hard day.
Hey, I've never been a paranoid before. It's always seemed to me that most governments are too incompetent to keep a good plot strung together all the way from coffee break to quitting time. But I am now very nervous about the government of the  United States of America.
Because Bill 'n' Al, whatever their other new-paradigm virtues, have allowed the very old-paradigm trogs of the Guardian Class to define as their highest duty the defense of America against an enemy that exists primarily in the imagination - and is  therefore capable of anything.
To assure absolute safety against such an enemy, there is no limit to the liberties we will eventually be asked to sacrifice. And, with a Clipper Chip in every phone, there will certainly be no technical limit on their ability to enforce those  sacrifices.
WHAT YOU CAN DO
GET CONGRESS TO LIFT THE CRYPTO EMBARGO
The administration is trying to impose Clipper on us by manipulating market forces. By purchasing massive numbers of Clipper devices, they intend to induce an economy of scale which will make them cheap while the export embargo renders all  competition either expensive or nonexistent.
We have to use the market to fight back. While it's unlikely that they'll back down on Clipper deployment, the Electronic Frontier Foundation believes that with sufficient public involvement, we can get Congress to eliminate the export embargo.

BOYCOTT CLIPPER DEVICES AND THE COMPANIES WHICH MAKE THEM.
Don't buy anything with a Clipper Chip in it. Don't buy any product from a company that manufactures devices with Big Brother inside. It is likely that the government will ask you to use Clipper for communications with the IRS or when doing business  with federal agencies. They cannot, as yet, require you to do so. Just say no.
LEARN ABOUT ENCRYPTION AND EXPLAIN THE ISSUES TO YOUR UNWIRED FRIENDS
The administration is banking on the likelihood that this stuff is too technically obscure to agitate anyone but nerds like us. Prove them wrong by patiently explaining what's going on to all the people you know who have never touched a computer and  glaze over at the mention of words like Maybe you glaze over yourself. Don't. It's not that hard. For some hands-on experience, download a copy of PGP - Pretty Good Privacy - a shareware encryption engine which uses the robust RSA encryption algorithm. And learn to use it.
GET YOUR COMPANY TO THINK ABOUT EMBEDDING REAL CRYPTOGRAPHY IN ITS PRODUCTS
If you work for a company that makes software, computer hardware, or any kind of communications device, work from within to get them to incorporate RSA or some other strong encryption scheme into their products. If they say that they are afraid to  violate the export embargo, ask them to consider manufacturing such products overseas and importing them back into the United States. There appears to be no law against that. Yet.
You might also lobby your company to join the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group, a coalition of companies and public interest groups - including IBM, Apple, Sun, Microsoft, and, interestingly, Clipper phone manufacturer AT&T - that is  working to get the embargo lifted.
Self-serving as it sounds coming from me, you can do a lot to help by becoming a member of one of these organizations. In addition to giving you access to the latest information on this subject, every additional member strengthens our credibility  with Congress.
.org. CPSR is also organizing a protest, to which you can lend your support by sending e-mail to clipper.petition with "I oppose Clipper" in the message body. Ftp/gopher/WAIS to cpsr.org /cpsr/privacy/

In his LA speech, Gore called the development of the NII "a revolution." And it is a revolutionary war we are engaged in here. Clipper is a last ditch attempt by the United States, the last great power from the old Industrial Era, to establish  imperial control over cyberspace. If they win, the most liberating development in the history of humankind could become, instead, the surveillance system which will monitor our grandchildren's morality. We can be better ancestors than that.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=PLEASE REDISTRIBUTE THIS MESSAGE WIDELY!!=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
-=-=-=-For copyright information, please see the end of this file.-=-=-=-=-
Electronic Privacy -- A Call to Action
This is a pivotal moment in history. The national security state, with the backing of the Clinton-Gore administration, is attempting a stealth strike on our rights. If they succeed, we could shortly find ourselves under a government with the automated ability to log the time, origin, and recipient of every call and e-mail message, to monitor our most private communications, to track our physical whereabouts continuously, and to keep better account of our financial transactions than we do -- all without a warrant.
Fact: On Friday, February 4, 1994, the Clinton administration announced support for the Clipper Chip and SKIPJACK encryption scheme as national Fact: Federal security agencies have been meeting with telecommunications companies to design back doors into the entire National Information Infrastructure (NII), including every telephone and data network, even including fax machines. In other words, any system connected to the NII would be required to include a "back door" in order to facilitate monitoring by government agencies.
We at WIRED Online believe that the adoption of these administration initiatives could result in a profound infringement of individual freedom and privacy, ours as well as yours. We urge you to read the rest of this letter, to examine the available materials, to consider these important issues for yourself, and to act to preserve the Bill of Rights in The proposed encryption scheme, which uses the SKIPJACK encryption algorithm and the Clipper Chip, relies on a "key escrow" system with a built-in "back door" so that security agents can decrypt and monitor even supposedly "secure" communications. While the administration claims that there will be "safeguards," the technology was developed by the virtually insular National Security Agency, and its algorithms remain classified.
The scope of Clipper is significantly broader than any previous surveillance strategy. The Clipper Chip will be installed directly into telecommunications devices such as telephones, computers, and digital set-
top boxes for interactive TV. Since the system can be used to encrypt any communications that pass across telecommunications lines (including text, sound and images), ANY AND ALL communication that passes through your system has the possibility of being intercepted. In addition, the administration's Information Infrastructure Task Force Working Group on Privacy is attempting to "front load" the NII with trapdoor technologies that would allow security agencies easy access to digitial conversations, including capturing electronic communications midstream. No communication system would be exempt from this effort, from the national telephone network to your local office computer network.
Of course, the administration claims that these trapdoors will be used only to catch criminals and that your privacy will be protected. But, as John Perry Barlow has put it, "trusting the government with your privacy is like trusting a Peeping Tom to install your window blinds." These government inititatives, taken together, constitute one of the most grievous threats to our constitutional liberties in modern times. The security agencies and the administration are involved in a stealth strike at our freedoms that could effectively abrogate the Bill of Rights in cyberspace, where we and our descendants will be spending increasingly larger parts of lives.
The Clipper initiative and the plans to require "back doors" throughout the NII immediate critical assessment. WIRED encourages you to seriously consider how these proposals might affect you. To help inform your decision, WIRED Online has set up a Clipper information archive through our Infobot mail server, Internet Gopher, World Wide Web, and other online The WIRED Online Clipper Archive features crucial essays written for WIRED by John Perry Barlow and Brock N.

The new Executive Director will work collaboratively with EFF's current
Executive Director, who is moving over to become the Director of Policy in
order to provide full time leadership to EFF's intensive and expanding
public policy activities.
EFF was started in 1990 by Mitchell Kapor, founder of Lotus Development
Corporation, and John Perry Barlow, an author and lecturer interested in
digital technology and society.   Both founders remain active in the
EFF identifies significant issues related to information and communication
technologies, and creates activities that seek to understand how they will
affect society, and change the way that people think, work and interact.
Current EFF activities focus on public policy, civil liberties, and public
The new Executive Director will develop EFF projects which integrate the
current array of policy initiatives, and will be designed to study and add
value to the discourse around particular problems or ideas by bringing
together information, resources and individuals outside of EFF who are
already working in key areas.  Other activities will be intended to promote
strategic dialogue and education about specific issues, to encourage the
development of new tools and paradigms, or to promote action for social,
political, or economic change that expands EFF's current work related to:
-  information infrastructure;
-  the development and application of law;
-  evolution of new technology; and
-  protection of civil liberties.
In addition, new projects will may address topics such as:
-  changes in social fabric and the meaning of community;
-  opportunities and effects on commerce/economics; and
-  international issues.
Activities may include conducting research, creating forums to encourage
discourse, inventing technical solutions, framing and reframing issues,
convening working groups, promoting education and public awareness,
persuading, organizing, lobbying and advocating, coalition building,
dissemination and publications.
About the Electronic Frontier Foundation:
EFF's current programs are designed to explore how civil liberties and the
practices of democracy are affected in the unique domain created when
individuals use electronic media to communicate.  EFF has been involved in
public interest litigation, providing on-line legal information for
computer users, electronic conferencing and broad public education through
print and electronic publications and communications activities.  EFF has
led the public debate on communications privacy, and supports efforts to
force broad access to government information.  As advancements in
technology have stimulated investment in a national information and
communications infrastructure, EFF has devised and promoted policy
proposals, formed public interest/private sector coalitions, encouraged
legislative reform, and organized grass roots support to ensure that the
emerging national network is affordable, democratic and widely accessible.
EFF also has explored issues related to privatization of the Internet, and
information privacy.
Management and Administration
EFF presently has 8 full time professional staff, and a ten member Board of
Directors who meet quarterly.  Board members at EFF are committed, active
and visible.
EFF is a membership organization with a current enrollment of several
thousand.  The membership program has potential for involving thousands of
technology users who are concerned about the future of communications
networks, and want to participate in influencing the evolution of the
networked world.  Membership will be an increasingly important component of
EFF's funding and advocacy base in coming years.
 In  1994, will have an annual budget of $1.6 million.  Funds come from
corporations, individual donors, grants, and membership.  An important goal
for the next few years will be to diversify EFF's funding base through a
variety of fundraising methods, including major donor programs, membership,
foundation grants, and earned income.
Responsibilities of the Executive Director:
o       Management and Administration:  The Executive Director sets the
tone for a vital and positive organizational culture at EFF, orchestrates
the activities of the staff, and ensures that EFF's strategic and
operational planning, fiscal practices, and daily administration run
smoothly and efficiently.
o       Resource Development:  EFF is in the process of developing and
expanding a comprehensive fundraising program  Over the short term, the
Executive Director will directly identify and secure funding from a variety
of sources, including individuals, corporations and foundations.  Over the
longer term, the Executive Director will be responsible for planning and
overseeing the implementation of a fundraising strategy that supports
current activities and lays the groundwork for expansion into project areas
defined by the Board and staff.
o       Membership Development and Member Relations: The Executive Director
will develop and oversee the implementation of an expansion plan to
increase EFF membership that integrates EFF's goals for fundraising, public
awareness, and programs, and will work with staff to define and maintain a
roster of member services and opportunities for activism.
o       Project Development and Management:  The Executive Director will
work with EFF's Board and staff to define, fund, and launch projects, then
will oversee their smooth operations.
o       Board Development and Relations:  The Executive Director serves as
an ex officio member of the Board of Directors, and is responsible for
leveraging the resources represented by the Board and other advisors to
benefit the organization.
o       External Relations and Public Awareness  The Executive Director
will be in charge of planning and delegating responsibility for a cohesive
program for external communications and public awareness that advances EFF
through media placement, speaking engagements, and publications.
The Executive Director must be skilled at organization building, program
development and staff management, with at least ten years of proven
experience in a responsible senior executive position.  Candidates should
enjoy seeing through a range of projects from initial vision through
planning to implementation, and attending to the details of staffing,
funding, project oversight and evaluation. Qualifications must include a
track record of successful, creative fundraising and revenue development.
This position is suitable for someone who enjoys engaging in lively
exchange of ideas, but who also leans towards the pragmatic application of
ideas to problem solving.  Applicants will be asked to demonstrate an
interest in EFF's work in law and public policy, civil liberties, computer
and communications technology, opportunities for commercial development,
and social evolution.   Candidates must be able to represent the
organization in public, so excellent communication skills--including the
ability to write and speak persuasively to a range of audiences--are
This position requires a flexible and organized individual with advanced
interpersonal skills, high energy level, problem solving approach, and the
ability to generate and sustain multiple activities.  Applicants should
enjoy and be effective at negotiating collaborations and partnerships with
other organizations and individuals.  Diplomacy, political sensibility, and
a sense of humor would come in handy.

@_subject: CPSR "explains" why Cantwell bill doesn't matter much - a rebuttal 
I'm finding myself, unfortunately, needing to respond to a widely
distributed article of sorts from the 3.05 issue of CSPR Alert.
The article was unsigned, so I can't address it to anyone by name.
The article states:
Avoiding the passive verb structures, this can better be rephrased as
"Some people have assumed that..."  People are not given impressions, they
_form_ impressions themselves.
It is indeed important to clarify information.  However the attempt to do
so that I see here does not in fact clarify.
To wit:
To my knowledge, no one in the know has suggested that the purpose of the
Cantwell bill is to "recind" the Clipper EES.  It is plain from a
reading of EFF's material on the subject, Cantwell's own commentary on the
bill, and, of course, the bill itself, that HR 3627 is not intended to
directly challenge Clipper (unlike Senator Leahy's proposed hearings, also
supported by EFF), but is intended to liberalize export restrictions,
pulling an important rug out from under Clipper/Skipjack's metaphoric feet.
If one cares to read the mass of Feb. 4 documents issued by the White
House, Dept. of State, and other agencies, it is abundantly clear that
clamping down export restrictions on all cryptographic products, except
those supporting the Administration's EES, is a major part of the proposed
Clipper deployment plan.  It's been more than adequately debated over the
last several months that the such a clampdown is necessary if Clipper is
to be a so-called success.  The measure is aimed at making it difficult
for any non-EES crypto application to compete with Clipper, thereby
establishing Clipper as a de facto standard.
Given this, _any_ attempt to reduce export restrictions is a positive move
for privacy-advocates to support, and serves as a strong, though indirect,
countermeasure against Clipper.
The writer of the message I am replying to here is well aware that this
entire matter has been thoroughly dealt with and fully explained.  I've
done this so many times, I am hesitant to do so again, but these recurring
misinterpretations leave me little choice but to clarify one more time:
From EFF's Dec. 8 Cryptography and Policy Statement:
If one actually reads this, one finds that our definition of "voluntary",
which has been made _very_ clear to the Administration in repeated
face-to-face meetings, stipulates:
  1) no forced key escrow, and no forcing of governmental-only escrow for
     even those that _want_ key escrow
  2) no governmental pressure on the marketplace
  3) no export restrictions
  4) no classified algorithm   5) no FIPS standard, and no forcing _anyone_, even govt. agencies, to      use it.
In other words, if the entire Clipper scheme were reworked such that
Clipper was nothing more than the open, _truly_ voluntary, publicly
examinable successor to DES - a quite innocuous govt. crypto standard -
then and only then would EFF and the Digital Privacy and Security
Working Group offer it's "tentative" support.
Please keep in mind that, barring secret NSA backdoors, there is nothing
inherently "bad" or "wrong" about the Clipper/Skipjack encryption.  Only
the methodology involved is reprehensible and unAmerican.  Please note that EFF also signed this letter.  Any opposition to CPSR
being perceived here is 100% illusory.
At any rate, I'd also like to point out that the DPSWG letter and the EFF
'93 crypto-policy statement are at this point old history.  They are no
longer applicable (an example line: "It is December, the escrow system is
still uncertain, and the Administration is still drafting a report which
was due in July" - how timely does this sound?)  Dragging such a dead
horse out for another beating is quite unfathomable to me.  I sincerely
hope this will the very last time I have to clarify this matter, partly
because I'm tired of repeating myself, but mostly because this sort of
inter-organization baiting is counter-intuitive and counter-productive for
all organizations and individuals involved, and could cost us (by which I
mean those opposing Clipper, in general) a lot of credibility.
To continue with the present matter, however:
This is false on its face.  Please support the notion that crypto which,
somehow, becomes illegalized in this country would be allowed to be
manufactured for export purposes only.  That's absurd; it's like imagining
a "gun control" law that banned using firearms in the US, but encouraged
everyone to buy guns and ship them to other countries.  At any rate, EFF intends to help see to it that Clipper does _not_ become
mandatory, nor that non-Clipper crypto is outlawed [pretty much the same in
effect].  No ifs, ands or buts about it.  Even beyond this, this scenario
is completely unrealistic, not least because the best crypto in the world
is _already_ available outside the US.  No amount of lawmaking is going to
stop it, short of destroying every computer, phone line, fax machine and
printing press in the country. Even this will not put the crypto genie back
in the bottle anyway.   Fact is, some of the best crypto in the world
wasn't even made in the US in the first place.  Ever heard of IDEA?
On this much I think we can be in complete agreement.
Of course it isn't.  Please quote anyone saying that it is.
Export control reform is indeed central to the issue.  Without export
controls, the major market-leverage crutch of the entire Clipper scheme is
ripped away, revealing the "poor lame beggar" act to be a scam.  Law
enforcement doesn't "need" the "protection from terrorists, drug dealers
and child pornographers" supposedly to be provided by Clipper, any more
than the American people need another hole in their privacy.  But you know
that.  If all you mean to say is that the Cantwell bill is not the only way
fight Clipper, and will not solve all of the problems, you'd be right.  But
why don't you just say so, instead of taking this as yet another opportunity
for grandstanding?  It's unbecoming of an organization on the same side as
the rest of us.
In closing, I'd just like to say that everyone realizes that Cantwell is
not the be-all and end-all of pro-privacy, anti-Clipper action.  You can
bet I added my signature to _your_ petition, and I hope everyone does,
whether it will work or not.  Better to have tried and failed that never
to have lifted a finger.  With that, I must ask you, have _you_ sent in
your letter of support for the Cantwell bill yet?  If not, it's real easy:
State your reasons for supporting the bill, and send them to
cantwell  The results, already numbering in the thousands, are
regularly printed out and delivered to Rep. Cantwell personally.
With high regard, but a fair amount of exasperation,

accompli" out-of-sight of democratic processes.
The sanctity of coded messages from Starfleet are meaningless if cybercops

This is a battle that cannot be won if fought solely in cyberspace.
Outside forces can restrain what transpires and control the dilithium
crystals that power the net. The implementation of draconian measures calls for innovative counter measures.
Opposition to Clipper is largely confined to net users.  We propose to
take arguments against the Clipper proposal to the public with
a video. Fighting with the traditional weapons of mass media  will get
the attention of the wider net-disinterested audience (most of whom
will intersect with the net in the future), than relying on the net
alone to conjure the necessary outcry to make Clipper an issue of public

stations, key legislators, and also be made available to the general
Submission guidelines:
-Send us a video of you containing your most cogent thoughts and
  passionate statement regarding Clipper.
-Please limit your comments to privacy issues in general and
  Clipper in particular.
-Send original tapes (we'll return them) in any format, 8mm, Hi8, VHS.
      ~~~~~~~~
  Hi8 is the best.
-Because of both the nature of video and the nature Clipper,

March 10, 1994 online debate between John Perry Barlow of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, and Dr. Dorothy Denning, over the Clipper Chip
scheme, from the Time Online forum of America On Line.
3/10/94 8:49:41 PM Opening "Chat Log 3/10/94 CLIPPER" for recording.
OnlineHost  : Good evening and welcome to the Time Online Odeon! Tonight we
look from both sides at the Clipper Chip, a semiconductor device that the
National Security Agency developed and wants installed in every telephone,
computer modem and fax machine.
OnlineHost  : In his article in the current issue of TIME, Philip
 "The chip combines a powerful encryption algorithm
with a ''back door'' -- the cryptographic equivalent of the master key that
opens schoolchildren's padlocks when they forget their combinations. A
''secure'' phone equipped with the chip could, with proper authorization,
be cracked by the government.
OnlineHost: "Law-enforcement agencies say they need this capability to keep
tabs on drug runners, terrorists and spies. Critics denounce the Clipper --
and a bill before Congress that would require phone companies to make it
easy to tap the new digital phones -- as Big Brotherly tools that will
strip citizens of whatever privacy they still have in the computer age.
OnlineHost: "Lined up on one side are the three-letter cloak-and-dagger
agencies -- the NSA, the CIA and the FBI -- and key policymakers in the
Clinton Administration (who are taking a surprisingly hard line on the
encryption issue). Opposing them is an equally unlikely coalition of
computer firms, civil libertarians, conservative columnists and a strange
breed of cryptoanarchists who call themselves the cypherpunks."
RPTime: Lined up on our stage tonight are John Perry Barlow, Dr. Dorothy
Denning and Philip Elmer-DeWitt. Barlow is co-founder of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, which promotes freedom in digital media. A recognized
commentator on computer security, he is arguing against the Clipper Chip
Dr. Denning is the chairperson of the Computer Science Department at
Georgetown University. A leading expert on cryptography and data security,
she favors the adoption of the Clipper Chip. Philip Elmer-DeWitt, TIME's
technology editor will lead the questioning of our guests. Audience
questions may be sent up using the Interact with Host function....Phil?
PhilipED: Dr. Denning, could you *briefly* make the case for why we need
the key escrow encryption system.
DDenning: The government needs a new encryption standard to replace DES.
They came up with a very strong algorithm called SKIPJACK. In making that
available, they didn't want to do it in a way that could ultimately prove
harmful to society. So they came up with the idea of key escrow so that if
SKIPJACK were used to conceal criminal activity, they would be able to get
access to the communications.
PhilipED: THanks. Mr. Barlow, could you briefly make the case *against*
Clipper. We'll see if I can be brief. We oppose Clipper in large part
because of the traffic analysis which it makes possible. We believe that it
is in the functional nature of the chip as designed to greatly enhance the
ability of government to observe who we are calling, when, and from where,
all fairly automatically and centrally. We also oppose Clipper because of
the many way in which we believe the escrow system could be compromised, by
people and institutions both inside and outside of government.
PhilipED: Dr. Denning, what about John's contention that Clipper makes it
easier to detect calling patterns.
DDenning: I don't buy this. First off, for law enforcement to access any
communications, they need a court order. Even if the communications are
encrypted. Second, with a court order, they can get access to call setup
information and find out what other lines the subject of the investigation
is talking to. This is of much more use than anything in the encrypted
PhilipED: John, is Dorothy right that you need a court order for call set
up info?
Barlow1: Dorothy, the government asked for and received over 100,000
calling records last year without a court order. I see nothing in the
Clipper documents which indicates that they would require a court order to
get this kind of information, which each chip would make readily available
to the entire network.
DDenning: You need a court order to do implement pen registers and dialed
number recorders in order to find out who is talking to whom.
Barlow1: Furthermore, my faith in court orders has been eroded by 30 years
of government wiretap abuse.
PhilipED: Aren't we talking about three different hurdles here, one for a
Barlow1: But that's only with the present system where putting a pen
register on a line requires physical entrance to a phone company site.
PhilipED: One for a pen register (to track calling patterns in real time)
and one for phone records.
RPTime: Let's take a question from the audience... How would you guarantee
that this facility will never be misused? If you can't make that guarantee,
why should a democratic society, with a prohibition against prior
restraint, consent to this? John Barlow?
Barlow1: There are three different sources of information, as you say. But
there are not three "hurdles." That sounds like a question for Dorothy. I
don't think we should, obviously.
RPTime: Dr. Denning?
DDenning: First of all, there has been no evidence of widespread abuse of
wiretaps since passage of the 1968 and 1978 wiretap statutes. Second, there
are a lot of security mechanisms going into it to protect against abuse.
Third, it will provide much greater protection against illegal wiretaps
than we have now, since almost all phone conversations are in the clear. It
will make virtually all illegal wiretaps impossible. Fourth, if for some
reason it doesn't provide adequate protection, we can destroy the key
databases and everyone will have absolute privacy against government
wiretaps. I don't think our society will tolerate that kind of abuse.
PhilipED: John, isn't Dorothy right that you're better off with compromised
encryption than none?
Barlow1: Gee, where to begin... First of all, there was plenty of abuse
after 1968. Remember Watergate, Dorothy? Second, I believe that Clipper in
the Net will dramatically *enhance* certain powers of...
DDenning: I was talking specifically about wiretap abuses. And there hasn't
been any evidence since the 1978 law.
Barlow1: surveillance over current technical abilities. One of the reasons
that wiretap hasn't been more abused is the bureaucratic overhead of
current practices. Make it so that it doesn't require 50 agents to conduct
a wire tap and you'll see a lot more of it. And Watergate included quite a
number of wiretap violations. Indeed, the burglers were caught trying to
install one. As to the assertion that we can always back up and destroy the
databases if we don't like it, I can't imagine that someone as bright as
yourself would believe that this is possible. Technology and power ratchet
into positions which almost never retract without a complete change in the
system of authority
RPTime: Care to respond Dr. Denning?
DDenning: Clipper would prevent the watergate burglars from getting
anywhere since they wouldn't have a court order. Clipper will not make
wiretaps cheaper or easier. Wiretaps are becoming more diffiults. And there
will always be more agents involved becasue they have to follow exacting
procedures, including minimization (throw out all conversations that are
not specific to the crime at hand).
Barlow1: Dorothy, they were from the *Government* remember? I can't imagine
that Nixon wouldn't have been able to find a sympathetic ear from somebody
at NIST and somebody else at Treasury. Further, you're not talking about
the truly insidious element of this, which is dramatically improved traffic
analysis. Content is less important than context, and most agents will
support this.
RPTime: Another question from the audience. JCMaille asks... Does the
government have a constitutional right of access to my personal
communications? Dr. Denning, why don't you go first?
DDenning: The Supreme Court ruled that wiretaps with a court order are
Constitutional. At one time, communications were not even protected under
the 4th Amendment. The government could wiretap without a court order! Now
a court order is required.
PhilipED: To put the question another way, do citizens have a right to use
powerful encryption?
DDenning: Right now there are no laws preventing the use of any encryption.
Clipper is voluntary. You can still use something else.
RPTime: We have to apologize. John Barlow has temporarily lost his
PhilipED: Dr. Denning, in your opinion... would a law outlawing powerful
encryption be unconstitutional?
DDenning: I don't think so. But that doesn't mean it will happen.
RPTime: John Barlow is back with us. Sorry for the interruption! Barlow,
Denning just said she didn't think a law banning powerful encryption would
be unconstitutional What do you say? Hi folks. Don't know what happened.
Gald to be back Gald indeed!
Barlow1: Actually, I believe that our current export embargoes are a
violation of the 1st Amendment which specify speech without regard to the
manner of speech. If we could restrict manner of speech, it would be
constitutional to require that everyone speak English. Which of course it
PhilipED: John, can you make the case why ordinary law-abiding citizens
need powerful encryption?
Barlow1: Because it is in the nature of digitally networked communications
to be quite visible. Everytime we make any sort of transaction in a digital
environment, we smear our fingerprints all over Cyberspace. If we are to
have any privacy in the future, we will need virtual "walls" made of
RPTime: Another audience question... Isn't this like the gun argument? If
guns are outlawed only criminals will have guns? Well, if clipper is
standardized, won't criminals be the ones NOT using it?
RPTime: Dr. Denning? If Clipper becomes the de facto standard, then it will
be the chief method of encryption. That would be what you'd get at Radio
Shack. What criminals use will depend on what is readily available and what
their cohorts are using. Both parties of a conversation have to use the
same thing. Criminals also talk to a lot of people outside their immediate
circle - e.g., to buy goods and services. Also, they can be quite stupid at
times. But the main thing is that criminals will not be able to take
advantage of the SKIPJACK algorithm as a way of concealing their
conversations. This is the whole point. It is not to catch criminals. It is
to allow people access to a really high quality algorithm in a way that
someone cannot use it to conceal criminal activity.
Barlow1: The gun analogy is excellent up to a point. I can't for the life
of me imagine why we would think that even a stupid criminal would use
Clipper if something else were available. And when I talk to people in the
administration their big hobgoblin is the "nuclear-armed" terrorist. Any
fanatic smart enough to assemble and detonate a nuclear device is going to
be smart enough to download PGP from a bulletin board somewhere. Also, I'd
like to point out that the gun analogy doesn't go the whole distance.
Crypto is by its nature a purely *defensive* technology. You can't shoot
people with it.
PhilipED: Speaking of PGP, Dr. Denning, is that encryption system secure,
in your opinion?
DDenning: I don't know of anyone who's been able to break the IDEA
algorithm that it uses.
RPTime: Back to the audience for a question from Steve HW.. This is for Dr.
Denning. What is the evidence of harm if the Clipper proposal is not
DDenning: The harm would be to the government. They would not be able to
use it and would have to resort to something less secure. Also, Clipper is
part of a larger project to make hardware available for encryption and
digital signatures. This will be used, for example, in the Defense Message
System. The goverment needs a new standard. I personally believe that
making really powerful encryption like SKIPJACK available without key
escrow could be harmful to society. Wiretaps have been essential for
preventing and solving many serious crimes and terrorist activities.
Barlow1: Why on earth would the government have to use something else if
they failed to get the rest of rest of us to buy into this folly? Hey, they
are already using SKIPJACK. It's a government algorithm and has been in use
for a...
DDenning: CPSR and others are asking the government to drop Clipper.
Barlow1: long time. There are plenty other algorithms which we can use
which are truly protected... unless of course, this is only the first step
in a process which will outlaw other forms of crypto. And I believe that it
must be. Makes absolutely no sense otherwise. EFF is not asking the
Government to drop Clipper, though we would vastly prefer they did. We're
merely asking that no steps be taken to require it either by law or
practice...as, for example, would be the case if you had to use a Clipper
chip to file your tax return.
PhilipED: Dr. Denning, do you think this is the "first step in a process to
outlaw crypto"?
DDenning: No I do not. The government has not been using SKIPJACK to my
knowledge. The Clipper initiative represents the first time that the
government has put one of their really good algorithms out there in the
unclassified arena. They are trying to do this in a way that won't backfire
against the public. Other NSA developed algorithms are not available for
purchase by the public.
Barlow1: I appreciate their willingness to make some of that crypto
research available to a public which has paid so much for it, but I'm
afraid that I would never trust an algorithm which was given to me by any
government. And I certainly don't trust a classified algorithm like
Skipjack, even without a back door which everyone can see. I think I'll
stick to systems which have been properly vetted to be clear of such
compromises, like RSA. I hope others will do likewise and that RSA will
become the standard which Clipper shouldn't be.
RPTime: Time for one more question from our audience... To John Barlow.
Isn't society becoming increasingly vulnerable to concerted
criminal/terrorist disruption, requiring *stronger* law enforcement tools?
Barlow1: Gee. I don't know. It's a scary world. However, I'm willing to
take my chances with the few terrorists and drug lords there are out there
rather than trusting government with the kind of almost unlimited
surveillance power which Clipper and Digital Telephony would give them.
It's a touch choice. But when you look at the evil perpetrated by
government over this century in the name of stopping crime, it far exceeds
that done by other organized criminals.
RPTime: Dr. Denning, hasn't remote listening technology enhanced police
abilities to eavesdrop to the point... where the loss of a few wire taps
won't mean much?
DDenning: No. They need to get the cooperation of the service providers to
implement a wiretap. The loss of some wiretaps could be costly indeed. As
an example, wiretaps were used to help solve a case that involved plans by
a Chicago gang from shooting down a commercial airliner. There have been 2
cases where they helped save the lives of kids who were going to be
kidnaped for the making of a snuff murder film. They helped solve a case
where a man's house was going to be bombed. I could go on. If we take
John's arguments about law enforcement to their logical conclusion, we'd
just get rid of law enforcement. I think it's better to have it. The people
in law enforcement hate it as much as the rest of us when some member of
the community does something wrong. And they correct it, design new
procedures and laws where necessary, and go on.
Barlow1: Oh, please. I'm not proposing eliminating police. I'm opposing
giving them unlimited powers. Also,these are the same cases cited over and
over by everyone from you to Judge Freeh. Surely, we aren't going to
fundamentally change the balance of power in this country because of these
two (undocumented, to my knowledge) stories.
DDenning: Clipper is not going to change the balance of power. It does not
give law enforcement any additional authority to do wiretaps.
Barlow1: Well, this is where we basically disagree, Dorothy. If we could
continue the same level of LE capacity we presently have, I'd have no
objection. But I believe, for reasons I'm not sure we have the bandwidth to
discuss here, that we are talking about dramatically enhancing their
abilities. For one thing, we would greatly reduce the bureaucratic overhead
involved in wiretap, which is what keeps it under 900 cases nationwide at
the present.
RPTime: And that will have to be the last word on the matter for tonight...
DDenning: The overhead of a wiretap is more likely to increase, not decrease.
PhilipED: Not quite! Maybe not! ;-)
RPTime: THAT will be the final word!
Barlow1: Well, let's get together and talk, Dorothy.
RPTime: TIME thanks Dr. Dorothy Denning and John Perry Barlow for being
with us tonight... along with Philip Elmer-DeWitt. Thank you all, and
goodnight! Thank you both. This was very interesting.
DDenning: Thank you for the opportunity to be here!

BACKGROUND: The Clinton Administration is backing a proposal by law enforcement
agencies that could make the entire communications infrastructure
susceptible to surveillance.  The Digital Telephony Proposal, reintroduced
this year after being successfully thwarted last year, would require
communications service providers to include "back doors" in their software
through which "wiretapping" can be done.  In addition, the proposal would
give law enforcement officers access to records *about* communications,
such as who you call, how long you talk, what online services you
frequent, who you send email to and where: if it's something you do
online, it is to be laid bare for inspection. Such traffic analysis can
reveal vast amounts of information about you, and the potential privacy
invasion is far more revealing than past techniques of traffic analysis. EFF is extremely concerned about this proposal and has prepared a
detailed summary to explain it and the harm it could do.  See:
EFF has received a draft of the FBI's new, proposed "Digital Telephony"
bill.  After initial analysis, we strongly condemn the bill, which would
require all common carriers to construct their networks to deliver to law
enforcement agencies, in real-time, both the contents of all communications
on their networks and the "signalling" or transactional information.
In short, the bill lays the groundwork for turning the National Information
Infrastructure into a nation-wide surveillance system, to be used by law
enforcement with few technical or legal safeguards.  This image is not
hyperbole, but a real assessment of the power of the technology and
inadequacy of current legal and technical privacy protections for users of
communications networks.
Although the FBI suggests that the bill is primarily designed to maintain
status quo wiretap capability in the face of technological changes, in
fact, it seeks vast new surveillance and monitoring tools.
Among the new powers given to law enforcement are:
*  Real-time access to transactional information creates the ability to
   monitor individuals "live".
*  Access to communication and signalling information for any mobile
   communication, regardless of location allows tracking of an individual's
   movements.
*  Expanded access to electronic communications services, such as the
   Internet, online information services, and BBSs.
*  The power to shut down non-compliant networks
Several documents, including the full text of the proposed bill and a more
detailed section-by-section analysis are available via anonymous ftp on
EFF's ftp site, as well as an archived copy of this announcement, and

GORE URGED TO PUSH DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARD FORWARD
Electronic security firms call for resolution of cryptographic
March 21, 1994--Eight leading data security firms have written
Vice President Albert Gore requesting that he prod the adoption
of the proposed Digital Signature Standard. A patent dispute
between the government and Public Key Partners is holding up the
standard, which would provide a way of verifying documents used
in electronic commerce.
     The companies--AT&T, among them--are frustrated that they
are missing business opportunity through government inaction. The
original standard was proposed in August 1991.
     PKP owns most of the critical U.S. cryptographic patents. It
negotiated an agreement with the National Institute of Standards
and Technology that would give PKP the right to earn royalties on
products using the government's digital signature standard. That
agreement, which was published in the Federal Register last June,
raised a ruckus in industry among vendors who did not want to pay
     Gore bent to that opposition on February 4, when his office
announced that the standard would be royalty free. While that
pronouncement greatly pleased industry, it has created a thicket
of sticky, interwoven problems that defy quick resolution.
     The federal government must either assume the royalty
payments, which would likely total millions of dollars; try to
invalidate PKP's patents in court; or come up with a new
standard. The first option is politically explosive and the
second and third are time consuming.
     "Many of us have invested tremendous time, effort and money
in developing systems and products" built to the proposed
standard, the letter said. A new standard would also encounter
royalty demands from PKP and delay commercial development by four
to five years. "Further delay would only delay product
development, frustrate the user base, fragment the market and

[cribbed from a pair of press releases]
House Subcommittee on Science Hearing on Internet Security
Chaired by Rep. Rick Boucher (D-VA)
March 22, 1994
9:30 a.m. - 2318 Rayburn House Office Building
The Subcommittee's interest in the issue arises in part because the
Internet is a prime method of communication between researchers in academia
and industry.  It is also a major means of communication for federal
researchers at agencies under the Subcommittee's jurisdiction.
Recent break-ins on the Internet prompted the federal Computer Emergency
Response Team to issue a special alert to Internet users on February 3, and
suggest that the system may be more vulnerable than generally acknowledged
to deliberate destruction or alteration of computer files.  The hearing
will evaluate the status of security on the Internet today and will
examine measures currently available to enhance security, assess the
effectiveness and degree of implementation of such measures, and identify
obstacles to enhancing Internet security.

Certainly, but as I recall it was "to detweil", rather than "to

submit it for the Jargon file.  I think some old posts using the term

[NB: I have a far less dim view of LD that most of you, since I've seen
him do useful work, so it's nothing personal.  The word detweil, however, is
an honest-to-goodness incidence of a new term arising in the language of
it's own accord, regardless of how anyone feels about it, so it ought to
be recorded for posterity.]

@_subject: password matrix thing for Windows: 
This was uploaded to us.  I'm wondering 2 things:
1) is it worth archiving - that is, is it a good idea, or a security risk
   for anyone that used it, and
2) would it qualify as an ITAR export-controlled crypto product.
I have my own ideas about this, but am interested in 2nd opinions.
Here's the readme for it (the package is psswrd30.zip)
Password Matrix 3.0
Written by Thomas Hassler
This Windows utility was written for my personal use and I then decided that
it might be marketable.  The basic concept of this program is fairly simple:
        It was created to be used in conjunction with an encryption
        utility like that of Norton Utilities and other shareware
        versions around.  This program allows people in a group to         pass encrypted files around with the password embedded in         the filename.
        Let me explain.  This utility uses a matrix (you get to make
        your own) to encode a filename from a password.  This would
        be incredibly complex if one used any old characters... so
        I used only numbers in my matrix.  this simplifies things
        and still allows a HUGE number of possible matrices.  Version
        3.0 will generate a random password and its corresponding
        filename, decode a filename, or encode a filename to or from
        a password.
        Once you see it in action you will see exactly what I mean.
        In the fully registered version ($10) there is a functioning
        filefinder (directory tree) that you can double-click on a
        filename and it decodes the password instantly.  If you
        use this program consistently, please register and you will
        have full benefits.
Future versions (registered users get prior notice) may contain:
                Random matrix generation
                Drag and drop (file to program and decrypts)
                Multiple user defined matrices
Thank you for supportin Hossware!  _________ end _________

@_subject: new PGP tool - your opinion on ITAR regs? 
Someone just sent me this, encrypted, via anon remailer yet asking for it
to be distributed.  Go figure.  Anyway, the author thinks it may be ITAR controlled, but from the looks of it it's not crypto at all but simply an
incidental utility that contains no crypto code.  I'll leave it up to y'all
to figure that out though.  Here's the doc, and I'll pass on the binary to
any US or Canada folks that want it to examine it.  Don't just ask for it
because you want it, wait till it shows up for ftp somewhere, eh.  I have to
manually send it to you, and am severely limited time-wise.  Thx.
_______ begin _________
This is a hack to the pgp source files random.h and random.c to support
a hardware random number generator. Please distribute these file as widely as possible in the U.S.
But be aware of the following problem. The U.S. governmemt is
trying to say that the export of files relating to cryptography
is illegal. In spite of the first ammentment to the U.S. constitution
and the inalienable rights of all peoples. They might say that
ranodm.h and random.c are subject to export controls in spite of the
fact that they have non-croptographic applications. So be aware that
if you export these file from the U.S. the govnmnt may try to
prosecute, persecute or otherwise screw you! I am sure that you are
aware of this problem. As a result I can not recommend that you
export this file out of the U.S.
The hacked files are under the GNU public licence same as the original
unhacked files.
This allows a program using random.h random.c to use a hardware random
number generator. Thus one need not type in all those stupid keyboard
timing strokes. The source files from 2.3a have been hacked.
The hack has been "ifdef"ed so that the hacked files compile the same as
the unhacked files unless certain "DEFINE"s have been defined.
I have tested this hack under MSDOS and OS/2. I do not know about other
machines compilers.
This hack supports the following combinations:
A hardware RNG supported by a OS drive.
It is assumed that the driver can be opened as a character
oriented device. Each byte read is a random byte.
(Tested under OS/2)
This hack attempts to directly read random bytes directly
from a bus hardware RNG. It is assumed that for each
inb instruction that you do on the port you get one random byte.
If necessary a spin wait can be done that enough time has passed
to insure random indpandance. (RANDHARDWAIT)
This has been tested under the MS-DOS program loader.
RANDHARDPORT and TESTCFG
same as above except that OS/2's IO driver TESTCFG$
is used to get random bytes from the port.
(Tested under OS/2)
is defined if you have a hardware RNG.
is defined to be the filespec of the random number generator if you have
a software driver.
is defined to be the port number of the random number generator if random.c
is to directly access the random number generator.
is the number of timer0 clicks that must be waited for  to assure that
the next random byte will be independant from the last. is defined is you want to use OS/2's TESTCFG driver to read a bus RNG
with the port address spedified by RANDHARDPORT.

@_subject: Clipper (Tessera, to be exact) laptops already being made 
NOTICE:  Tessera PCMCIA card laptops are already being
manufactured, as of at least one week ago.  For those new to the issue, the Tessera is an encryption device for
PCMCIA-capable notebook computers, being a cartridge bearing a hardware
encryption chip.  The chip is based on the Skipjack algorithm, just like
the Clipper chip (for phones), and it too features so-called "key escrow"
(key surrender, to police/intelligence agencies). See ftp.eff.org, /pub/EFF/Issues/Crypto/ and subdirectories thereof for
more inforation.  Or call the EFF BBS at +1 202 638 6120 (N81) and look
in the "Privacy--Clipper" file area. I spoke 2 days ago, informally, with a friend who works for a PC
manufacturer.  He told me he was thinking of quitting, and was looking
for a new job.  He was asked by his employer to help resolve a technical
problem for a customer.  The customer turned out to be none other than
the NSA, and the problem product was a notebook PC manufactured by this
company.  Specifically, there was a serious design flaw that rendered it
incompatible with the Tessera cards they were installing in the laptops.
This "batch" were being made for internal NSA use, not commercial
distribution, and it appears that the NSA will go looking elsewhere unless
this bug can be fixed, so Tessera deployment is temporarily stalled.
I have no reason to doubt this information, and believe it to be genuine.
All this aside, I personally couldn't give a hoot whether the superspooks
cripple their own security.  However, this is yet another indication that
Executive branch agencies are ready and willing to deploy Skipjack-derived
product, and are unlikely to give it up w/o even more of a fight.

For immediate release: April 18, 1994
For additional information:
Bill Winter, Director of Communications
        (202) 543-1988
Libertarian Party Announces Opposition to Digital Telephony Act
        Calling it a "serious infringement of civil liberties and a gross violation of property rights," the Libertarian Party National Committee unanimously voted to oppose the Digital Telephony and Communications Act of         At their quarterly meeting in Kansas City, Missouri, the governing body of America's third-largest political party charged that "the Digital Telephony Act would make furnishing the FBI with easy wiretapping capability the overriding priority for designers of telephone equipment and related         "It is a lie to call this legislation a 'Privacy Improvement Act,'" said Bill Evers, the National Committee member from California who sponsored the resolution.         The Digital Telephony Act, noted the resolution, "requires telephone, cable television, and computer network companies to ensure that the government
can conduct surveillance while private communication is going on. It requires the installation of surveillance-facilitating software in telephone switching equipment to expose personal information - such as telephone-calling patterns,
credit card purchases, banking records, and medical records - to the view of the government."
        "Such personal information should be the private property of either the company that assembles it or the individual to whom it pertains," said         Libertarians also oppose the Digital Telephony Act because it "would require a fundamental re-engineering of the communications infrastructure at great expense to American taxpayers, and to the owners of private communications systems," said Evers.
        The Libertarian National Committee also unanimously voted to oppose the National Security Agency's Escrowed Encryption Standard - the so-called Clipper Chip system - or any "government policies promoting or requiring specific encryption methods for civilian use." The party also urged the "repeal of the U.S. ban on export abroad of Clipper-free encryption devices produced by American companies."
        "Government-mandated encryption standards will foster indiscriminate surveillance of private communications by the government," charged Evers.         The resolution said "the Clinton Administration plans to induce American manufacturers to install government-readable encryption devices in every telephone, fax machine, and computer modem made in the United States."
        "The Clinton Administration is explicitly denying that the American people have the right to communicate in private," said Evers. By contrast, he said, "The Libertarian Party has long upheld the civil liberties of the American citizen."
        Approximately 120 Libertarians serve in elected and appointed office around the country, including four State Representatives in New Hampshire and two mayors in California. The Libertarian Party platform calls for vigorous defense of the Bill of Rights, free enterprise, civil liberties, free trade, and private charity.         #          #          #

For Immediate Release      4.20.94               *Distrubute Widely*
This is a request for submissions of video testimony regarding Clipper.
The public is increasingly becoming aware of the Clipper. Hearings are
scheduled to held on April 27 and May 3, 1994 by Sen. Patrick Leahy's
(D-VT), of the Senate Judiciary's Technology and the Law Subcommittee,
the subject of which will be the Clipper initiative and the FBI's
draft Digital Telephony surveillance bill.
Momentum is building, get involved. Unless the conquest of cyberspace
goes unchallenged by the public-at-large, First and Fourth Amendment
rights will be abrogated in a "fait accompli" out-of-sight of
democratic processes.
This is a battle that cannot be won if fought solely in cyberspace.
The implementation of draconian measures calls for innovative counter
measures. We propose to take arguments against the Clipper proposal to
the public with a video. Fighting with the traditional weapons of mass
media  will get the attention of the wider net-disinterested audience
(most of whom will intersect with the net in the future), than relying
on the net alone to conjure the necessary outcry to make Clipper an
issue of public
We need your collected clips to put together a composite
argument. It will be distributed to public access television
stations, key legislators, and also be made available to the general
Submission guidelines: - DEADLINE MAY 8TH
-Send us a video of you containing your most cogent thoughts and
  passionate statement regarding Clipper.
-Please limit your comments to privacy issues in general and
  Clipper in particular.
-Send original tapes (we'll return them) in any format, 8mm, Hi8, VHS.
      ~~~~~~~~
  Hi8 is the best.
-Because of both the nature of video and the nature Clipper,
  guerrilla theater is encouraged.
-Submissions of arguments in favor of Clipper will also be considered
  for inclusion.
-Contributions from outside the U.S. are welcome.
-Suggestions about content and/or format welcome.
-Please send your video as soon as possible, but no later than May 8th
 for consideration.

@_subject: John Perry Barlow - Euology for Cynthia Horner 
Forwarded message:
I know that news of her death is circulating the Net and I'm getting an
incredible outpouring of shock and sympathy. For any good it might do, I
hope you will post this to some of the places where news of her death has
appeared. I mean it to stand as her gravestone in the virtual world.
Cynthia Horner's Eulogy
read by John Perry Barlow at her funeral April 22, 1994 in Nanaimo,
Vancouver Island, BC..
I don't know most of you, and I envy the many among you who were graced
with Cynthia all her life. I only knew her a little while.  We spent the
last glorious year of her life together. It was the best year of my life
and, I firmly believe, it was the best year of her life too.
Last Sunday morning, during the last hour we spent together, we were
playing with a cat which strangely green eyes.
She looked at me with her own beautiful green eyes and said, "You know,
James Joyce said that green eyes were a sign of the supernatural." The way
she said it seemed pointed and meaningful. And hope makes me want to
believe it all the more meaningful now.
I don't know that I believe in the supernatural, but I do believe in
miracles, and our time together was filled with the events of magical
unlikelihood. I also believe that sometimes angels live among us, hidden
within our fellow human beings. I'm convinced that such an angel dwelled in
Cynthia. I felt this presence often in Cynthia's lightness of being, in her
decency, her tolerance, her incredible love. I never heard Cynthia speak
ill of anyone nor did I ever hear anyone speak ill of her. She gave joy and
solace to all who met her.
I feel her angel still, dancing around the spiritual periphery, just beyond
the sight of my eyes, narrowed as they are with the glare of ordinary
light. Her graceful goodness continues to surround me, if less focused and
tangible than before.
With a care that was appropriately reverential, Cynthia and I built a love
which was an inspiration to all who came into contact with it. We felt,
quite consciously, that it was our gift to the world. We wanted to show the
hesitant the miracle that comes when two people give their hearts
unconditionally, honestly, fearlessly, and without reservation or
judgement. We wanted to make our union into a message of hope, and I
believe we did, even though we knew that hearts opened so freely can be
shattered if something should go wrong. As my heart is shattered now.
So among the waves of tragedy which have crashed on me with her death is a
terror that our message of hope has been changed into a dreadful warning.
But I am here to tell you that had I known at the beginning that I would be
here today doing this terrible thing, I would still have loved her as
unhesitatingly, because true love is worth any price one is asked to pay.
The other message we wished to convey was one of faith in the essential
goodness and purpose of life. I have always felt that no matter how
inscrutable its ways and means, the universe is working perfectly and
working according to a greater plan than we can know.
In the last few days, I have had to battle with the fear that everything is
actually just random, that the universe is a howling void of meaningless
chaos, indifferent to everything that I value. All hope has at times seemed
unjustified to me.
But groundless hope, like unconditional love, is the only kind worth having.
It's true name is faith. As it is a shallow faith which goes untested, so
it is that if we can keep our faith through this terrible test, we will
emerge with a conviction of incredible and enduring strength. And this
faith will become Cynthia's greatest gift to us. If we can build with our
lives a monument to her light and her love, she will not have died in vain,
and her death will become as much a miracle as was her life.

implications for privacy and First Amendment rights, are to be held
May 3, 1994.
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), of the Senate Judiciary's Technology and the Law
Subcommittee, has expressed skepticism of the Clipper encryption scheme,
and has called for hearings to examine the problems of this proposal and its
implementation.  This effort is due in part to all of you who responded to
EFF's grassroots campaign to raise fundamental questions about security and
free speech issues in relation to the White House proposal.
The Senate hearing will be held on May 3, 1994, 9:30am EDT, Hart
Building Rm. 216, and should feature testimony from Trusted Information
Systems' Steve Walker, Whitfield Diffie of Sun Microsystems, Asst. Atty.
Gen. Jo Ann Harris (Justice Dept., Criminal Div.), NSA Director Adm. Mike
McConnell, and Raymond G. Kammer, NIST Dep. Dir.

Following the Senate Hearings, the House Science, Space and Technology
Subcommittee on Technology, Evironment and Aviation will be holding a
hearing to address related civil liberties issues of both the Clipper
scheme and the FBI "Digital Telephony" proposal, which so far remains
unsponsored. The hearing will be chaired by Rep. Tim Valentine (D-NC), and
is scheduled for May 3, 1994, 1pm EDT, Rayburn Building Rm. 2318.  Witnesses
will include Dep. Dir. Raymond G. Kammer of NIST, NSA's Dr. Clinton Brooks,
representatives from industry in a panel that will include USTA and TIA,
expert witnesses Dr. Dorothy Denning and Dr. David Farber, EFF's Jerry
Berman on behalf of DPSWG, Chmn. Willis Ware of the Congress/NIST System
Security and Privacy Advisory Board, and in a last moment change, the
FBI will be represented after all, by James Kallstrom.
The House hearing is being held "to review the Administration's policies
and legislative proposals dealing with electronic survellance, privacy
and security, ...the adequacy of the Computer Security Act in protecting
goverment computer systems", and "the Administration's proposed Digital
Telephony legislation and decision to promulgate a voluntary federal
encryption standard".

@_subject: DOJ Clipper documents scheduled for summer release under FOIA 
Forwarded message:
As you know, there has been much debate about the Clipper Chip initiative, but relatively little hard information.  John Gilmore, member of the board of directors of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, filed FOIA requests to numerous government agencies last April after the Clipper plan was announced.  In June 1993, he filed a FOIA lawsuit against the Justice Department ("DOJ") and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI").
Gilmore v. FBI, et al, C-93-2117, U.S. District Judge Charles
Legge, Northern District of California.
As a result of this lawsuit, the Justice Department has agreed to a staggered release of some documents about Clipper and Digital Telephony.  The Justice Department and Gilmore signed a joint stipulation and agreement on Friday, April 29, 1994, in which the Justice Department and several other federal agencies agreed to release documents over the next several months:
          a)     DOJ's Office of Information and Privacy ("OIP")  will
transmit all documents recovered in its search for responsive
documents that it has identified as requiring referrals or
consultations to the appropriate agencies or DOJ components by
May 31, 1994.  OIP will complete processing of all documents that
it has identified as not  requiring  referrals  or  consultations  to
other agencies or DOJ components by June 20, 1994.
          b)     DOJ's Justice Management Division ("JMD") will
complete processing of all documents  recovered  in  its  search  for
responsive documents, excluding documents which have been
referred for processing to other agencies, by July 30, 1994.
          0)     The Office of Management and Budget ("OMB") will
respond to all DOJ consultation  requests  which  OMB  had  received
as of April 20, 1994 by May 20, 1994.
          d)     The National Security Agency ("NSA") will  respond  to
all DOJ consultation requests which it  had  received  as  of  April
20, 1994 by July 18, 1994.  NSA  will  complete  processing  of  all
documents which had been referred to it by DOJ as of April 20,
1994 for direct response to plaintiff by July 18, 1994.
          e)     The National Security Council ("NSC") will  respond  to
all DOJ consultation requests which NBC had received  as  of  April
20, 1994 by July 29, 1994.
          f)     The Department of Commerce and National Institute  of
Standards and  Technology  (collectively  "Commerce")  will  respond
to all DOJ consultation requests which  Commerce  had  received  as
of April 20, 1994 by August 7, 1994.  Commerce will complete
processing of all documents which had been  referred  to  it  by  DOJ
as of April 20, 1994 for direct  response  to  plaintiff  by  August
7,   1994.
The documents being processed by the NSC include the Presidential Review
Directive and Presidential Decision Directive which started the Clipper
initiative.  We have been informed that NSC is processing the two
final versions as well as 68 draft versions.  We have also been informed that documents produced in the course
of the OMB legislative clearance process for the Digital Telephony
Bill are being processed.  This should provide insight into how the
government decided to proceed with this bill.
We have also been informed that there are approximately 25 documents produced in the course of the government's solicitation
of industry views on Clipper.  Obviously, we do not know how much useful information will be
released.  It is probable that the documents will be heavily redacted.
Given the recent directives from the President and the Attorney General
that all possible discretionary disclosures of information should be made,
we hope, optimistically, that these disclosures will prove illuminating.
Unfortunately, the FBI is not a party to this agreement.  We are in
the process of attempting to obtain the release of about 3000 pages
of FBI records.  FBI has told the Court that it will be approximately
2 years and 8 months before it will even begin processing Gilmore's
request, and that actual processing will take about a year, if not more.
We believe that this delay is unlawful and cannot be countenanced.  Lee Tien
Attorney for John Gilmore

EFF SUMMARIES
May 4, 1994
* Senate Subcommittee on Technology and the Law holds Clipper Hearing
* House Subcommittee on Technology, Environment and Aviation holds              Executive Director Jerry Berman and Board Member David Farber              testify
SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE HOLDS CLIPPER HEARING
Tuesday proved to be a busy day for Clipper on the Hill, as the House Science, Space and Technology Subcommittee on Technology, Environment and Aviation also considered the Clipper and Digital Telephony proposals.  Witnesses on the panel included James Kallstrom of the FBI, NSA's Clinton Brooks, NIST Deputy Director Ray Kammer, Dr. Dorothy Denning, Dr. David Faber, EFF Executive Director Jerry Berman (on behalf of DPSWG), and Chmn. Willis Ware of the Congress/NIST System Security and Privacy Advisory Board. The discussion centered mainly on the Clipper issue.
Unlike the Senate panel, there seemed to be some support for the Clipper proposal on the House Subcommittee.  Rep. Dan Glickman (D-KS), Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, declared his "cautious support", for the proposal, and stressed law enforcement's need for strong surveillance abilities.  Subcommittee Chairman Valentine (D-NC), as well as Reps. Morella (R-MD) and Rohrabacher (R-CA) all expressed reservations.  James Kallstrom urged full support of both the Clipper and Digital Telephony proposals on behalf of all law enforcement, citing the need to counter the increasing sophistication of digital communications technologies.  Kallstrom painted a picture of a network populated by criminals, terrorists, and drug dealers which would pose a great danger to public safety, unless law enforcement is given the ability to intercept illegal communications.  EFF's Jerry Berman countered this assertion by arguing that Clipper would only solve law enforcement's problems if criminals use it.  The only way to do this, Berman added, would be to mandate the Clipper standard, something which the Administration does not claim to want to do.  The only solution is for Congress to deny appropriation for Clipper and send the Administration back to the drawing board, Berman argued.
Dr. Farber, appearing as an expert witness,  stated that solutions to the Clipper issue will not come easily and will not come in one big step.  Rather, a carefully considered and open approach is required.  While stressing the need for encryption standards on communications networks, Dr. Farber cautioned against "smoke-filled-room standards" of encryption which are, in his view, likely to bead mistrust.  Dr. Farber also argued for the removal of export  controls on encryption NSA's Clinton Brooks expressed support for Congressional Consideration of the Clipper issue.  He argued that Clipper is a sound technological solution to a legitimate law enforcement and National Security dilemma, and that a public debate on its merits would eventually remove the misinformation and mistrust of government, and would prove Clipper to be in the public interest.  Dr. Farber offered a strong caution to this, expressing the concern that a future administration may find it necessary to mandate the Clipper standard.  Dr. Farber suggested that at the very least Congress weld into law a guarantee that Clipper remain voluntary, that the Judiciary be an escrow holder.  He cautioned, in the words of Benjamin Franklin, "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety"

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a public interest membership organization dedicated to achieving the democratic potential of new communications and computer technology and works to protect civil liberties in new digital environments.  EFF also coordinates the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG), a coalition of more than 50 computer, communications, and public interest organizations and associations working on communications privacy issues.  The Working Group has strongly opposed the Administration's clipper chip and digital telephony proposals. interest in these issues.  It is our belief that Administration policy developed in this area threatens individual privacy rights, will thwart the development of the information infrastructure, and does not even meet the stated needs of law enforcement and national security agencies.  A fresh and comprehensive look at these issues is needed.
I.	Background on digital privacy and security policy
and the desire to ensure law enforcement access, the Administration has proposed that individuals and organizations who use encryption deposit a copy of their private key -- the means to decode any communications they send -- with the federal government. undermines the need for security and privacy without resolving important law enforcement concerns.  It is up to the Congress to send the Administration back to the drawing board.

[according to the author, this may be redistributed at will; for print

The Clipper Chip:
Government Monopoly in the Making
or Ineffective Law Enforcement
Charles Lewis         On April 16, 1993, the White House released an official
announcement of a new encryption technology called the Clipper Chip.
Developed by the National Security Agency (NSA), and implemented by the
National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), the Clipper
initiative was intended to satisfy the private sector's need for secure
encryption of data, specifically telephone communications, and at the same
time allow law enforcement agencies to tap into these encrypted
communications when such actions were approved by the Attorney General.
        The needs of private industry for secure lines of communication
have long been left unfulfilled, primarily because of obsolete legislation
that considers encryption algorithms to be a munitions for export purposes.
For fear of the potential uses of such algorithms in the wrong hands, the
export of technology implementing said algorithms has been virtually
impossible.  Industry leaders have been reluctant to incorporate encryption
into their products because munitions laws would require that the versions
made for export would have to be significantly different from the ones sold
for domestic use.  Meanwhile, industrial espionage remains a significant
risk for many private companies.
        The government maintains that introducing secure encryption for
public use could have disastrous effects for law enforcement agencies.
"Unfortunately, the same encryption technology that can help Americans
protect business secrets and personal privacy can also be used by
terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals," (The White House, Office of
the Press Secretary, April 4, 1994).  The Clipper initiative was meant to
satisfy both the needs of the public sector for privacy, and the needs of
law enforcement agencies to conduct legitimate electronic surveillance.
        To this end, the government proposed the controversial Escrow
Encryption Standard (EES), of which Clipper is the first implementation.
The concept is simple:  Clipper will provide encryption of telephone calls
between two Clipper equipped phones.  This encryption will be unnoticeable
at either end of the connection, but the signal in between will be
scrambled to prevent monitoring by unauthorized parties.  The scrambled
signal can be decoded by using two data 'keys,' each held by a different
government agency and released only when the Attorney General approves a
request for them.  By using this back door in the encryption algorithm, law
enforcement agencies will still be able to conduct surveillance.
        Following the Clinton Administration's announcement of EES, there
were concerned responses from many industry leaders and organizations.  The
primary cause for their anxiety was the power of the government to override
the encryption provided by Clipper.  This was defended as being a trade-off
necessary for the compromise between the availability of encryption to the
public and the needs of law enforcement agencies to effectively do their
jobs.  EES proponents argue that it does not make it any easier to obtain
approval for electronic surveillance.
        The issue of whether the government can be trusted to hold the keys
to this system is wide open for debate.  Essentially, the government is
asking us to trust them in this issue, and many aren't sure that this is
wise or necessary.  These arguments have far reaching implications for the
future of personal privacy in America.  It is very important for Americans,
both in and out of the government, to consider how these issues affect us
all.  In the case of the EES, however, there are much more clear cut
reasons why this initiative is both ineffective in satisfying the purposes
for which it was devised, and damaging to those who would develop or use
        Even if we are to trust that the government is acting in our best
interests by allowing law enforcement agencies to compromise the encryption
standard, and even if we trust that the EES will provide adequate
protection of the keys that can be used to bypass this encryption, many
have asked just how effective the algorithm implemented in Clipper, called
the SKIPJACK algorithm, is in the first place.  The answer to this is
impossible to ascertain first hand, unless you are one of the privileged
few who were responsible for the development or testing of the algorithm.
Secrecy is necessary in order to preserve the law enforcement functions ofs
the algorithm.  According to the NIST approval of EES, this ensures that no
one can develop communications devices which use the algorithm without the
law enforcement features (NIST, 2/9/94).  That is to say that if the
algorithm were made public, it would be no problem for a company to produce
telephones which were capable of having encrypted communications with
Clipper equipped phones, but would be impervious to decryption by law
enforcement agencies, defeating the purpose of the algorithm.
        This secrecy comes at a cost.  There is universal concern about the
adequacy of an algorithm which cannot be revealed.  In order to allay these
concerns, the government had SKIPJACK examined by a panel of independent
experts, who found it to be secure.  Even so, it is difficult for many to
simply take the word of this panel rather than to test the algorithm
themselves.  Dorothy Denning, a member of this panel, has little patience
for outsiders who want in: "Nothing can be concluded from a statement
questioning the technology by someone who has not seen it regardless of
whether that person is an expert in security," (Denning, 2/9/94).  By
making this claim, she uniformly ignores the questions of the entire
cryptography community.
        The attitude that no one outside of a government agency or
government appointed panel is worthy of developing or testing SKIPJACK is
echoed by Stuart Baker of the NSA in defending the secrecy surrounding the
algorithm: "There are very few institutions other than government that are
willing to devote both the kind of energy and resources that it takes to
eliminate the last few bugs in encryption software or machinery," (Fourth
Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy, 3/24/94).  Denning and Baker
would have us believe that there is nothing useful to be had from
consulting with the many industry and academic experts doing research in
this field.  In truth, it has often been the case that innovations in
cryptography have come from non-government sources.  There are many private
companies providing encryption services professionally, as well as computer
scientists doing important research in the field.  Ignoring the opinions of
these professionals not only damages the study of cryptography, but
potentially hurts the EES by not taking advantage of what these experts
have to offer.
        Even the sacrifice of a publicly available algorithm for the sake
of law enforcement is in vain.  Whitfield Diffie of Sun Microsystems, a
veteran researcher in cryptography, tells us that "the Clipper system, as
it has been described, is not difficult to bypass," (Diffie, 5/11/93).  If
Clipper chips do become as widely available as the government suggests, it
will be possible for them to be used in such a manner as to defeat the law
enforcement features of the chip.  Also, what is to stop one from simply
using a different sort of encryption that does not have the back door that
Clipper does?
        According to official press releases, nothing.  Government
spokespeople repeatedly state that the use of the Clipper chip is entirely
voluntary.  But there are some drawbacks to not using it.  For one thing,
it is expected that the first big customer of Clipper equipped devices will
be the government itself.  Not only will this create many users of the EES
right off, but it will also force companies that do business with the
government to fall in line with the initiative.  Another drawback to not
using the government standard will be the old munitions laws restricting
the export of encrypting devices.  While the government is planning on
loosening these restrictions for products using Clipper, "...the
Administration will continue to restrict export of the most sophisticated
encryption devices," (White House, Office of the Press Secretary, 2/4/94).
It appears that the government hopes to simply squeeze out Clipper
competitors economically.
        There are two possible results of the Clipper initiative.  In the
first scenario, competing encryption standards will arise.  Without the
government stepping in to make sure that the Clipper chip is the only form
of telecommunications encryption available, this is inevitable.  Alternate
encryption standards will sell to the segment of consumers who would rather
not trust the government to listen in on their phone calls. If this
happens, Clipper will become completely ineffective for law enforcement
because of the people using encryption that doesn't conform to the EES.  At
best, Clipper will fail.
        The only possible way that Clipper can not fail is if U.S.
government successfully eliminates competitors selling encryption without a
back door.  Again, the government has repeatedly stated that this is not
part of their game plan.  If we are to believe that they will not try to
create a Clipper monopoly, the first scenario is the only one possible.  On
the other hand, if the government does in fact force competitors out of the
market using economic and legislative pressures, it would be extremely
damaging both for the agencies outside of the government which work in the
cryptography field, and for individuals using cryptography.  The NSA would
become the only agency in America with access to the workings of the system
which the entire industry would be dependent upon.  Additionally, only the
NSA would have a say in keeping the EES competitive by incorporating new
advances in encryption.  Because of this choke hold, private research and
innovation in this field would be brought to a halt.
        Either the U.S. government is prepared to take draconian measures
to ensure that the EES is used universally, or the Clipper chip will be
unable to keep the phone tapping business alive in the Information Age.
The fact that these are the only possible outcomes is reason enough to
oppose the Clipper initiative.

                                   INITIATIVE STRESSED BY NIST
                                   OFFICIAL IN TESTIMONY
     A government-developed technology to protect the security of
telephone conversations and other information communicated over
telephone lines is meant to be used by both the government and
the private sector on a strictly voluntary, as-needed basis --
and is not intended to be mandated in the future, a National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) official said today
in congressional testimony.
     In statements to both the Senate Committee on the Judiciary
and House Subcommittee on Technology, Environment and Aviation,
NIST Deputy Director Raymond Kammer stressed that the "voluntary
key escrow" coding system "first and foremost, was devised to
provide solid, first-rate cryptographic security for the
protection of information held by the government when government
agencies decide such protection is needed for unclassified
government communications."  He cited as examples the protection
of tax records, Social Security records, census data and other
proprietary information when transmitted over telephone lines.
     At the same time, Kammer pointed out the importance of
strong encryption protection for citizens and U.S. companies. Encryption "protects the individual privacy of our citizens....
Private-sector organizations can also benefit from encryption by
securing their product development and marketing plans, for
example.  It also can protect against industrial espionage,"
Kammer said.
     But the increasing proliferation of encryption techniques
also is expected to make the law enforcement community's job more
difficult, he said, and the voluntary key escrow approach
provides a way for law enforcement authorities -- when legally
authorized -- to decode messages sent over telecommunications
systems using the key escrow technique.   The initiative is
intended to strike a balance between the needs of law enforcement
and national security with the needs of businesses and
individuals for security and privacy.      In every instance, Kammer stressed, the system is being made
available on a strictly voluntary basis.  Each federal agency can
use the key escrow technology to protect its information on an
as-needed basis.  Companies can choose to use the system when
they need excellent security -- or they can use any other
encryption technologies available in the marketplace.  "Let me be
clear," Kammer said.  "This Administration does not seek
legislation to prohibit or in any way restrict the domestic use
of cryptography."

Forwarded message:
(I thought you might be interested in this.)
New Cyberspace TV Program
I am developing  a new program on cyberspace in conjunction with WGBH-TV,
PBS' Boston affiliate.  The show is intended to be a window onto the world
of computer networks for the television viewer, whose point of  view is
that the world of on-line communications is interesting because of what
people do there, not because of the digital plumbing which enables it.
We will be focusing on the human aspects of networking and the individual
and social aspects of being on-line.  Cyberspace will be portrayed as a
not-so-really strange territory after all, where all of us will
increasingly come to live and work.  My role is to guide people through
this new territory, introducing the audience to its native culture, its
scenic attraction, and its sights and sounds.
We assume our audience is motivated by curiosity to learn more about what
goes on in cyberspace, but we do not assume they are knowledgeable or, in
general experienced with it.  On the other hand, we will not trivialize the
subject matter by reducing it to a least common denominator.
We will give the show a look and feel which is approachable and
down-to-earth.  Interview guests and roundtable participants will be drawn
from the net community itself.   There will be plenty of demos of cool net
stuff from Mosaic, CU See Me, and other cutting-edge applications and
We are taping two test shows in mid-June which will be shown in Boston and
other cities and hope to have some sort of national distribution (to be
determined) in the fall for a regularly scheduled program.  We are also
going to create a WWW server for the show, the segments of which will be
downloadable.  The server will be have on it additional material which
won't fit into the show format.
An Invitation:
We would like to include some video clips of net citizens expressing their
greatest hope and worst fear about the future of the net which we will edit
into an on-air piece for our regular feedback session.
It's important to me to have the voices heard (and faces seen) of people
already on the net.  This is an opportunity for those  of us who enjoy
appreciate the decentralized and democratic character to express that
sentiment to a mass audience.  I hope you'll take advantage of the
Since an individual on-air clip will run at most 20-30 seconds, please keep
your statement succinct.
In shooting the clip, please feel free to pick a location which says
something about yourself, whether it's your computer, your pet, or the
great outdoors.
We can accept Quicktime movies, VHS cassettes,  or 8mm tapes.  If you
enclose a mailer, we will return your tape.   We can also pick up digital
submissions from any FTP site, etc.

@_subject: PGP 2.5 available from Electronic Frontier Foundation ftp site 
With the early May announcement of the availability of the new version of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) a free encryption program for email and other
files, EFF has decided to provide PGP and other cryptographic material to
users of the Internet.  EFF applauds and congratulates the PGP development
team, MIT (who initially made PGP 2.5 available), and RSA Data Security
(patent holders of the RSA and RSAREF encryption code) for coming to an
agreement and providing this new version of the most popular email encryption
program in the world - a free version that is finally legal in the US.
Previous versions of PGP arguably violated US patent law, with the
exception of ViaCrypt's commercial PGP 2.4, but the new 2.5 is built upon
the free RSAREF encryption functions, rather than the previous RSA functions
which required a special licensing arrangement for use in applications
like PGP.  Despite the patent & licensing issues being resolved, PGP is still not legally
exportable from the United States (except to Canada), due to ITAR export
restrictions which categorize cryptographic materials as weapons of war.  Thus, EFF can only make PGP and other crypto tools and source code available
to US and Canadian nationals currently residing in the US or Canada and
connecting to EFF's site from a US or Canadian site.
PGP and similar material is available from EFF's ftp site in a hidden
directory, and only to Americans and Canadians.  Access to this directory
can be obtained by reading and following the instructions in the README.Dist
file at:
ftp.eff.org, /pub/Net_info/Tools/Crypto/
gopher.eff.org, 1/Net_info/Tools/Crypto
PGP can only be obtained from EFF via ftp currently.  Gopher and WWW
access to the material itself is not supported at this time.
Only the DOS and Unix versions of PGP 2.5 have been released so far.
The Unix version is in source code form, and so can be readily ported to
VMS, NeXT and many other operating systems.  A Macintosh version has yet to
be released. If you would like to see US export restrictions on cryptography removed,
please send a message supporting Rep. Cantwell's export reform act (bill
HR3627) to cantwell ask your Representatives to co-sponsor this
bill, and ask your Senators to co-sponsor Sen. Murray's companion bill
(S1846) in the US Senate.  Congress contact information is available from

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
A little further along in the AP story on the record level of Clinton
Administration wire taps, Micheal J. Sniffen states:
This microphone recorded conversations in the office, not the telephone.  As
I stated to Dr. Dorthy Denning of Georgetown University, escrowed encryption
is unnecessary for surveillance.  In addition to "bugs", intellegence agencies
also provide long range listening technology to the enforcement agencies like
the FBI and DEA.  Organized criminals don't use the phone to discuss business,
it can be tapped.
This sort of blows a hole in Stuart Baker's arguments for escrowed encryption
being necessary in law enforcement.  The next time he offends someone with his
tired trig joke, I would hope that he is ask to rebut this.  As well as to estimate how many conversations and participants are actually involved in the
given figure of 333 1993 "wiretaps."
Long range listening was found to fall under federal "wiretap" rules in the
Smalldone case in Denver during the summer of 1982.  Try to FOIA that info.

@_subject: More FOIA docs online at EFF 
A few new arrivals at ftp.eff.org that may be of immediate interest.
The first is a recent bill, scheduled for markup very soon.  EFF urges you
to ask your Senators to co-sponsor and support this bill.  Those following
EFF Boardmember John Gilmore's FOIA battle with NSA, the Justice Dept. and
other recalcitrant agencies will know why this is so important.  For those
that don't, the issue in a nutshell is that the original FOIA (Freedom of
Information Act) did not adquately cover records that are not in hardcopy
format, such as computer files; it granted overly-broad excuses to not
release documents, and provided for few penalties for violating FOIA.
As a result, secretive agencies have been breaking the law with impunity, vastly exceeding the mandated times in which the law requires them to
respond to FOIA requests from citizens, and have been using
technicalities, vague passages, and filmy excuses to withold important
information that belongs to the American people.
This new bill, supported by EFF, aims to correct these problems, and
ensure that FOIA works the way it should.
The other file is adequately described by it's entry from our
05/12/94  - added important recent bill supported by EFF:  Electronic

As someone involved in the telephone industry on the level of security
and data integrity... I would like to inform everyone that uses modems
and/or are bbs operators of some information.
The first thing that everyone that uses a modem should know is that
every time you fire up your modem your activating monitoring equipment
somewhere in the U.S.  I have worked for several large telephone
networks that routinely monitor and reroute modem and fax transmissions
through devices that allow them to view what is being transmitted and
even decodes encrypted data and fax packets used by major corporations
and governmental agencies.  This is allowed under the heading of
"Maintenance Monitoring" and may be continued for up to 6 months without
the need of any legal paperwork being generated.  Under an obscure
pre-WWII ruling by the agency that is now the FCC... "No information may
be encoded or transmitted over PUBLIC or PRIVATE forms of telephony or
radio with the exception of those agencies involved in the National
Security" a further designation goes on to say "with the exception of
the MORSE system of 'transmittal', any communication that is not
interpretable by the human ear is forbidden and unlawful."  The
information gathered goes to 3 seperate database facilities...1 is
codenamed Diana and is located in Brussels, the 2nd is named Fredrick
and is located somewhere in Malaysia, the 3rd is named Elizabeth and is
located in Boulder, Colorado.  The information stored in these systems
is accessable by the US Government, Interpol, Scotland Yard and various
other such agencies.  Your credit rating is also affected by your modem
usage... if you ever get a copy of your credit history and find a
listing that has HN06443 <--= this is a negative risk rating. or a code
87AT4 <---= an even more negative risk rating.... these will usually
have no description on them... and if you inquire about them they will
tell you that it just comes from the system that way. I am currently
working for another major carrier as a consultant and have been able to
watch these systems operate...at one unnamed long distance carrier here
in Columbus Ohio in their NCC, Network Control Center, you can see
several rows of computer terminals which have approximately 30 to 40
separate windows in each... these windows have data transmissions that
are being monitored... banks of 9 track tapes are going constantly to
record everything.  Everyone should realize that even if a sysop posts a
disclaimer at the beginning of his bbs about no access to governmental
agencies or law enforcement...that it isn't worth the time it takes to
type it in... looking forward to hearing reactions to this.

@_subject: ALERT!  *one day* to save crypto-privacy provisions of export bill! 
ONE DAY DEADLINE!  The House Intelligence Committee will probably make their
decision on this vital issue tomorrow afternoon, Wed. June 15, 1994.  If
you've not had your say on whether the State Dept. & NSA will be allowed to continue to restrict the flow of public cryptographic products, write, call
and fax *today*.  Updated fax information for the entire Intelligence Cmte.
is below.  The Committee seems receptive to hearing alternatives to the extreme position
held by the National Security Agency - what you have to say does matter!
        House Intelligence Committee holds key to Crypto Export
         ask     June 14, 1994      *DISTRIBUTE WIDELY*
Today, the U.S. State Department controls the export of most
encryption, working closely with the National Security Agency (NSA) to
limit products that provide real privacy, from cell-phones to PC
software.  A bill introduced by Rep. Maria Cantwell would instead give
authority over non-military crypto exports to the Commerce Department.
Commerce has much more reasonable regulations, with "First
Amendment"-style unlimited publishing of publicly available software,
including PGP, Kerberos, RIPEM, RSAREF, and mass-market commercial
software.  The bill also prevents the Commerce Dept. from tightening
the regulations even if NSA somehow gets its tentacles into Commerce.
A few months ago, you-all sent over 5600 messages to Rep. Cantwell in
support of her bill, H.R. 3627.  As a result, on May 18, the bill
passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee by being incorporated into
the Export Administration Act of 1994, H.R. 3937.
Now the battle has become more intense.  This portion of H.R. 3937 has
been referred to the House Intelligence Committee with the intent to
kill or severely maim it.  We need your help again, to urge the
Intelligence Committee to keep crypto export liberalization intact.
The House and Senate Intelligence Committees, the only watchdogs for
the NSA, tend to follow the agency's wishes when they wave the magic
"national security" wand.  They need plenty of input from the public
that tells them that the nation will be *more* secure with good
encryption, even though the NSA will be less happy.
Not just computer users, but all users of telephones, cable TV, health
care, and credit information systems would benefit from this change.
The security of these applications is built on the foundation laid by
the operating systems and network protocols on which they run.  If
this bill is passed, you will see high quality encryption built into
Microsoft Windows, into the MacOS, into major Unix workstations, into
the Internet, into cellular phones, into interactive television.  The
software already exists for confidentiality, privacy, and security of
local and networked information, but it's not built-in to these
systems because of the export ban.  Today, each company could build
two operating systems, one gutted for international use, but this
would be costly and confusing for them and their customers, and would
not allow international networks such as the Internet or telephones to
be made secure and private.  With this bill, these limits disappear.
Furthermore, the Clinton Administration plans to permit high volume
exports of Clipper products, while continuing to require tedious
paperwork for truly secure encryption products.  The bill would give
Clipper and other crypto software more even-handed treatment.
The bill also eliminates a senseless situation on the Internet.
Today, crypto software can only be freely distributed from non-U.S.
archive sites.  It would eliminate that problem as well as the threat
of prosecution against U.S. freeware authors of crypto software.
This is the dream we've all been working toward.  Here's how you can
help to make this dream a reality.  The Intelligence Committee must
make its decision on the bill before June 17, so time is critical:
1) Fax a short letter TODAY to the chair of the Intelligence
Committee, Representative Dan Glickman (D-KS).  Ask him in your own
words to leave the encryption provisions of H.R. 3937 intact.  Use a
positive tone ("Please support...") rather than a flame or a rant.
One paragraph is fine.  State your title and organization if you will
look more important or better informed than the average citizen.  Rep.
Glickman's committee fax number is +1 202 225 1991.  This is the best
option, since individual letters are given the most weight by members
of Congress, particularly when sent on letterhead paper.
2) If you are unable to fax a letter, send an e-mail message to Rep.
Glickman at glickman  Software or staff at the Electronic
Frontier Foundation will either fax it in, or print it out and
hand-deliver it for you.
3) Send a copy of this message to everyone you know in Kansas, and
personally urge them to write to Rep. Glickman today.  Letters from
constituents get a lot more weight, since they are from people who
could actually vote for or against him in the next election.
4) If your own Representative is on the Intelligence Committee, send
him or her a copy of what you sent Rep. Glickman.  There's a list of all
such Reps. below.  Even if we lose this battle, you will have started
educating your own Rep. about crypto policy.
5) Become a member of EFF.  Our strength comes from our members' strength.
Send a note to membership asking how to join.

Dear Representative Glickman:
I realize that tomorrow your committee will probably act on the encryption
provisions of H.R. 3937, the Export Administration Act of 1994.  I urge
that you allow them to remain as they were introduced in Rep. Cantwell's H.R. 3627, and subsequently incorporated into H.R. 3937. Privacy is the
basis for my concern, and I support the ability to use secure encryption. Additionally, prohibiting the export of secure cryptography from the United
States puts the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage internationally, for who
would choose to use crypography known to be insecure (such as the "Clipper
Chip", or products intentionally weakened to pass excessively stringent
export restrictions)?  Please, support privacy and security by preserving
the cryptography export language of H.R. 3937.

Floor Statement of Congressman Jack Brooks
U.S. House of Representatives
re:  Encryption Export Controls
June 15, 1994
ENCRYPTION POLICY ENDANGERS U.S. COMPETITIVENESS
IN GLOBAL MARKETPLACE
        For some time now, a debate has been raging in the media and in the
halls of Congress over the Administration's intention to require U.S.
corporations to use and market the Clipper Chip, an encryption device
developed in secret by the National Security Agency.
        The Clipper Chip will provide industry and others with the ability
to encode telephone and computer communications.  The use of the Clipper
Chip as the U.S. encryption standard is a concept promoted by both the
intelligence and law enforcement communities because it is designed with a
back door to make it relatively easy for these agencies to listen in on
these communications.
        The law enforcement and intelligence communities have a legitimate
concern that advances in technology will make their jobs more difficult. But the issue here is whether attempts to restrict the development, use and
export of encryption amounts to closing the barn door after the horse has
already escaped.
        The notion that we can limit encryption is just plain fanciful. Encryption technology is available worldwide -- and will become more
available as time goes on.
        First, generally available software with encryption capabilities is
sold within the U.S. at thousands of retail outlets, by mail, even over the
phone.  These programs may be transferred abroad in minutes by anyone using
a public telephone line and a computer modem.
        Second, it is estimated that over 200 programs from some 22
countries -- including Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Japan,
India, and South Africa -- use some form of encryption that the government
currently prohibits U.S. companies from exporting.  And this is just the
beginning.  According to the May 16, 1994 issue of _Fortune_ , not only
are U.S. companies willing to purchase foreign encryption devices, American
produces of encrypted software are also moving production overseas to
escape the current U.S. export controls.
        Third, encryption techniques and technology are well understood
throughout the world.  Encryption is routinely taught in computer science
programs.  Text books explain the underlying encryption technology. International organizations have published protocols for implementing high
level encryption.  Actual implementations of encryption -- programs ready
to use by even computer novices -- are on the Internet.
        The only result of continued U.S. export controls is to threaten
the continued preeminence of America's computer software and hardware
companies in the world markets.  These restrictive policies jeopardize the
health of American companies, and the jobs and revenues they generate.
        I support, therefore, the immediate revision of current export
controls over encryption devices to comport with the reality of worldwide
encryption availability.
        I believe law enforcement and the intelligence community would be
better served by finding real, and targeted ways to deal with international
terrorists and criminals rather than promoting scattershot policies, which
restrict American industries' ability to design, produce, and market
        Now -- more than ever -- we cannot afford to harm our economic
competitiveness and justify it in the name of National Security.

Puh-lease.  Lets excerise a little basic logic here, Boxx.  If the

lot of them there?  And if, perchance, the cypherpunks are not an
overwhelming majority of the net.population, don't you think you'd expect
them to be "diluted" on the net at large?  Come now, the same dilution

See current (July 1994) _BoardWatch_, pp. 60-63.  There's an article on an
e-money scheme called NetCash.  Unfortunately it is utterly stupid, but
BW is giving it a semi-endorsement.  Some of you d-c afficionados might
like to disabuse them of some notions. Some of the flaws:
1) not cryptographically secure
2) someone can randomly guess the ser. # of your digicash and go spend it
3) non-anonymous
4) the person transferring the netbucks to you can actually spend it
before you validate it with the central server (e.g. it would only be of
use in cases where product/service has yet to be rendered, and customer
gives you the netmoney, which you verify and only then serve them. Completely useless otherwise.)
There are more, but those are the main ones.

WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1994 JUL 11 (NB) -- The US Customs Service
has picked Information Resource Engineering (IRE) of Baltimore, Md.,
to supply encryption technology to protect Drug Enforcement
Agency information traveling on telephone and computer networks in the
Pacific Rim.
But Customs won't be using the Clipper encryption technology the
Clinton Administration and the National Security Agency is pushing.
"Clipper simply is not available," Anthony Caputo, chief executive
officer of IRE told Newsbytes. "Clipper has been approved for
government agencies, but there just isn't much equipment out there
So the US Customs will be using IRE's technology, which uses its
proprietary Atlas encryption algorithm and meets the National
Institute of Standards and Technology's Digital Encryption Standard
or DES for short.
"DES products are the only thing you can buy today," said Caputo. "We
expect to see Clipper become fairly widely used and we will have
Clipper versions of our systems available when that happens."
IRE was founded in 1983 by former crytologists at the National
Security Agency who wanted to develop technology to make encryption
easy and inexpensive. The company has focused on the banking industry,
providing security for corporate wire transfers.
Caputo says that Citibank, J.P. Morgan & Co., Chase Manhattan, Bankers
Trust and Banc One are using IRE systems, as are AT&T and the US
Treasury Department.
"The government is far ahead of private industry on electronic
commerce," Caputo said. "Banks are just getting around to it. One way
people will use the information superhighway is for electronic
commerce, and we are the best positioned company in the world for this

 SPACE TECHNOLOGY INVESTOR/COMMERCIAL SPACE NEWS -- No. 24
[edited for brevity]
 3- US COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING POLICY FINALLY SET
    On 9 March, the Clinton administration finally released the official
 administration policy on commercial collection and sale of high-
 resolution satellite images.  This policy allows the US Department of
 Commerce to license U.S. companies to operate private remote sensing
 space systems and sell images from those systems to domestic and foreign
 customers.  Notably, it sets no limits on the resolution of imagery that
 can be sold.
    Under this policy, US firms desiring to operate such space systems
 must apply for a license from the Department of Commerce, in accordance
 with the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992.  To get a license, each
 firm must:
    - maintain a record of all satellite tasking for the previous year
 and to allow the US government access to this record.
    - operate the satellite in accord with the characteristics submitted
 in the license application (although changes can be submitted for
 approval)
    - obtain appropriate export licenses for foreign sales of data or
 hardware.  This specifically includes transfer of export sensitive
 components, subsystems, and information concerning remote sensing space
 capabilities which are on the US Munitions Control List.  Transfer of
 such sensitive technology can be made available to foreign entities only
 on the basis of a government-to-government agreement.
    - use only approved encryption devices, since the US government
 retains the right to deny unauthorized access to this data to others
 during periods when national security, international      obligations
 and/or foreign policies may be compromised (as provided for under the
 LRS Policy Act).
    - use a data downlink format that allows the US Government access and
 use of the data during periods when national security, international
 obligations and/or foreign policies may be      compromised (also as as
 provided for in the Act).
    - allow the US government to limit data collection and/or
 distribution when national security or international obligations and/or
 foreign policies may be compromised.  Such a limitation may only be
 imposed when the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of State, and the
 Secretary of Commerce agree to this.  Any such decision can be appealed
 directly to the President.
    - Pursuant to the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992, licensees
 must notify the government of intentions to enter to significant
 agreements with foreign customers.
    Under these policy guidelines, a license to Lockheed for a high-
 resolution space remote sensing satellite was granted on 22 March.
    [Commentary:  I was starting to wonder if any more of the commercial
 remote sensing licenses would make it through the licensing system.
 Lockheed originally submitted their license application back in June of
 1993, and under the statues which govern the licensing process, they
 were supposed to have had a ruling on their license within 120 days.
    The policy apparently hung up until the National Security Council (in
 particular the State Department, DoD, and CIA) could come to an
 agreement about how to handle such data in times of crisis.  The concern
 expressed was legitimate -- similar data could have compromised US and
 allied forces during another situation like Saddam's War in Kuwait/Iraq.
 During that crisis, SPOT and Landsat voluntarily limited access to data
 from the Middle East -- but everyone involved recognized some procedure
 needed to be agreed upon and put in place rather having to work the
 situation on an ad-hoc basis.
    The commercial firms planning for high-resolution commercial remote
 sensing systems seem to fairly pleased with the new policy, and other
 announcements of license filings are rumored to be in the works.  (See
 below.)]

@_subject: Administration Buys Off EES Patent Holder (fwd) 
CyberWire Dispatch // Copyright (c) 1994 // July 11 //
Jacking in from the "Blank Check" Port:
Washington, DC -- The Administration will today announce it has
sidestepped the threat of patent infringement lawsuit involving its Escrow
Encryption System, commonly known as Clipper.  The solution: Toss the
original patent holder a blank check and buy him off.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the agency
walking point for the White House on its proposed encryption Clipper
encryption standard, has agreed in principle to license two key patents
relating to the technical workings of the key escrow system from patent
holder Silvio Macali, an MIT professor.
The government's key escrow system depends on the capturing of digital
"keys" that allow authorized law enforcement officials to unscramble
Clipper encoded speech or Capstone encoded data, including electronic mail.
Macali, as it now turns out, thought up the idea and had the moxy to patent
his scheme.   Macali's inventions detail the process whereby a digital key
is divided into pieces.  Those pieces are then held by separate "key escrow
agents" which now turn out to be hand picked government agencies;  one is
NIST the other a division of the Treasury Department.  Those keys must be
combined to successfully unlock the code that allows law enforcement
officials to listen in.
The license agreement effectively eliminates "concerns Macali raised about
possible infringement of his patents," said NIST spokeswoman, Anne Enright
Shepherd.  It also sidesteps a potentially ugly lawsuit in which Macali
lawyers could have uncovered all sorts of currently  unknown information
about the Clipper program.
According to sources familiar with the negotiations, the government's
agreement with Macali grants the Administration a nonexclusive license to
the patents for use in current implementations of Clipper and Capstone and
for future implementations, Shepherd said.
It's not known whether the government will make a single payment to Macali
or pay royalties.  "The procurement phase of the agreement is still
continuing," Shepherd said.  Disclosure of the amount paid to Macali and
details of the license agreement are expected to be made public sometime
early next month, she said.  That agreement, however, wont result in any
user fees, Shepherd said.
Questions Raised
Although the government's action today nullifies a pesky problem, it also
continues to raise serious questions about the Administration's --  and
more pointedly -- about the National Security Agency's ability to ramrod an
encryption policy that has been elevated to the status of a national
security issue.
Surely the NSA or NIST can dial up the U.S. Patent Office and query its
database, looking for patent conflicts.  Apparently the clock and dagger
crowd was too busy with other matters.  Arrogance or oversight?
"Macali made the existence of his patents known during the public comment
period," Shepherd said. "He let the government know he had some patents
that he felt were similar to some technology used by the key escrow system.
So the discussions kind of began at that point," she said.
Unfortunately, the "public comment" period was launched only after the
White House trotted out its Clipper policy as set in stone.  Nobody
expected Macali to piss the parade.
Privacy and civil liberties groups have roundly criticized the government
for developing Clipper in secrecy, not allowing public debate on the issue.
If that debate had taken place, Macali would have come forward years ago.
Despite the Administration's continued efforts to push Clipper into the
deep waters of the mass market, there are rumblings that it may not be
christened after all.  At very least, it may not be the only encryption
standard blessed by the government.
Several groups are now floating their own alternatives to the Clipper
program.  And although the National Security Agency is working behind the
scenes to sink such efforts, NIST, at least, is making the appearance of
Earlier this year, NIST put out a call for the Cooperative Research and
Development Agreement (CREDA), which was an effort to draw publicly
interested parties into a cooperative venture to develop a key escrow
Those that came forward have now thrown off working formally with CREDA,
but have instead formed their own working group, government sources said.
Those efforts are being heard and taken seriously, according to several
government sources familiar with the discussions.  "Encryption isn't a
front page issue, but those [inside the Administration] working on this
issue are tired of being beat up over it," said a White House official.
Discussions on Clipper alternatives "are continuing," Shepherd said.  "And
we're still open to other alternative ideas and we're working with the
people who have presented their own ideas at this point."
Meeks out...

Themes and Goals:
The development of CSCW applications generally implies new ways of
recording and transmitting detailed information about individual users'
behaviour.  Frequently,this is associated with new forms of interpersonal
access.  This is the case for those working in settings as diverse as team
based manufacturing environments and the "media spaces" of corporate
research labs.  Even routine use of email poses still unresolved questions
about who has access to messages and under what conditions. Such new
communications capabilities pose the possibility of unwelcome intrusion and
exposure.  More generally, they can undermine the ability of individuals
and groups to negotiate control of information about themselves.  Personal
privacy may be threatened and the potential for CSCW technologies to support
collaboration impaired.
This workshop builds upon the experiences with the privacy workshop and
panel sessions held at CSCW'92 (see reports in SIGCHI Bulletin, October
1993, and especially, SIGOIS Bulletin, August 1993).   Whereas the former
workshop focused on identifying privacy issues, this one will emphasise
remedial responses.  In particular, it will explore theoretical and
practical considerations in developing various forms of communications
spaces under the control of the individuals and groups concerned.
The specific goals of this one day workshop are:
   - to further develop a network of researchers and practitioners who have
     an ongoing interest in the privacy and related implications of
     CSCW technologies
   - to explore the theoretical and practical aspects of defining
     manageable personal and group information spaces
     within CSCW applications
   - to consider possibilities for diverse forms of participation (and non-
     participation) in the use of communications media and technologically
     mediated workspaces
   - to elaborate a general framework to guide CSCW developers and
     implementors in creating applications that are sensitive to
     personal/collectiveinformation control concerns.
Planned Activities:
In the morning session, participants will explore in detail several
realistic scenarios involving privacy/accessibility issues.  These will
reflect a range of common/plausible situations by drawing upon prior
research and participants' written submissions. Discussions of each
scenario will focus on identifying the sources of concern, their basis in
technologies and/or social relations, and the ways in which potential
privacy violations may be avoided or diminished.  Design options
will be highlighted.
The afternoon session will identify and elaborate the general principles
that underlie the scenarios analysed earlier.  These will cover
recommendations and appropriate rationales that can guide the design of
technologies and inform working practices. The main product will be a set
of key ideas to incorporate in a report suitable for publication in
SIGCHI/SIGOIS Bulletins.
Organizer Backgrounds:
Andrew Clement's research has been on the social and organizational
implications of workplace computerization.  A central theme of this work
has been the ways in which users exercise control and are controlled
through computing technology.  He has written several papers on the subject
of electronic workplace surveillance and, as a participant in the Ontario
Telepresence project, is currently researching the privacy aspects of
media spaces.  He organized the privacy workshop at CSCW'92.  He is vice
chair of IFIP WG9.1 (Computers and Work).
Lucy Suchman's research concerns the social relations of computer systems
design and use, including studies of cooperative working practices in
technology-intensive workplaces.  Through her involvement in the CSCW and
Participatory Design communities, she has worked to develop more
use-oriented practices of systems design.  She was Program Chair for the
Second Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and is engaged in
ongoing dialogues with the PARC/EuroPARC media space and ubiquitous
computing projects.
Ina Wagner is the Director of the Centre for CSCW at the Technical
University of Vienna.  Her recent research has focused on the political and
cultural aspects of software development practices and on time management
issues in medical teams. She was the principal organizer of the recent
IFIP WG9.1 NetWORKing Conference ("Connecting Workers In and Between
Organizations") and serves as the Working Group's chair.
Participant Selection:
Prospective participants are asked to submit a short position statement
(2-5 pages) describing their background, nature of interest in the workshop
themes (e.g. privacy, CSCW application development, what they consider to
be the primary issues and promising remedial approaches).  As part of this,
prospective participants are also encouraged to submit a brief scenario
description (2-3 pages), suitable for discussion in the workshop.  These
should describe a situation, preferably based on experience, which explores
a privacy concern in connection with the use of CSCW technologies. The
richer and more detailed the better.  Identities of individuals and
organizations should be suitably disguised.  Position statements and
scenarios will be distributed to participants in advance of the session.
Participants, to a maximum of 20, will be selected to promote a stimulating
mix of researchers, developers, implementors and users of CSCW
Four copies of the position paper/scenario should be sent by August 15,

EFF Analysis of Vice-President Gore's Letter on Cryptography Policy
July 22, 1994
Two days ago, Vice-President Al Gore signaled a major setback in the
Administration's Clipper program, and a willingness to engage in serious
negotiations leading to a comprehensive new policy on digital privacy and
security.  Many questions remain about the future, but one thing is
certain: Clipper is a dead end, and those of us who are concerned about
digital privacy have won a new opportunity to shape a better policy.
The Vice-President's letter to Rep. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) made it clear
that while Clipper might have a small place in the telephone security
market, it has no future in the digital world.  "...[T]he Clipper Chip is
an approved federal standard for telephone communications and not for
computer networks and video networks.  For that reason, we are working with
industry to investigate other technologies for those applications....  We
welcome the opportunity to work with industry to design a more versatile,
less expensive system.  Such a key escrow system would be implementable in
software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof, would not rely
upon a classified algorithm, would be voluntary, and would be exportable." Clipper does not meet most of these criteria, so, according to the Vice-
President, it is a dead end.
END OF THE LINE FOR CLIPPER -- LONG-RUN EFFORT TO DRIVE MARKET WILL FAIL
The premise of the Clipper program was that the government could drive the
market toward use of encryption products which incorporated
government-based key escrow agents.  A series of subtle and not so subtle
government actions would encourage private citizens to use this technology,
thus preserving law enforcement access to encrypted communications. Clipper was originally announced as the first element of a family of
hardware-based, government key escrow encryption devices that would meet
security needs for both voice and data communications on into the future. Clipper itself was purely a voice and low-speed data product, but other
members of the Skipjack family, including Tessera and Capstone, were to be
compatible with Clipper and were intended to lead the way from escrowed
encryption in voice to escrowed encryption for data.  Plans are already
announced, in fact, to use Tessera and Capstone in large government email
networks.  At the time, the hope was that government use of this technology
would push private sector users toward key escrow systems as well.
Now, the announcement that the Administration is re-thinking plans for data
encryption standards leaves Clipper a stranded technology.  No one wants to
buy, or worse yet, standardize on, technology which has no upgrade path. As a long-run effort to force the market toward government-escrowed
encryption standards, Clipper is a failure.
WE STILL MUST WORK FOR VOLUNTARY, OPEN, EXPORTABLE STANDARDS
The fight for privacy and security in digital media is by no means over. Though the Administration has backed away from Clipper, and expressed
willingness to talk about other solutions, we are pursuing serious progress
on the following issues:
        * Improved telephone encryption standards
For the reasons listed by the Vice-President, in addition to the inherent
problems of making copies of all your keys available, Clipper is a poor
choice for telephone encryption.  Industry should develop a standard for
truly secure and private telephones, make them available from multiple
manufacturers worldwide, and make them interoperate securely with audio
conferencing software on multimedia PC's.
        * Truly voluntary standards
Any cryptographic standard adopted by the government for private sector use
must be truly voluntary.  Voluntary means, to us, that there are statutory
guarantees that no citizen will be required or pressured into using the
standard for communications with the government, or with others.  No
government benefits, services, or programs should be conditioned on use of
a particular standard, especially if it involves government or private key
        * Open standards
Standards chosen must be developed in an open, public process, free from
classified algorithms.  The worldwide independent technical community must
be able to create and evaluate draft standards, without restriction or
government interference, and without any limits on full participation by
the international cryptographic community.
        * No government escrow systems
Any civilian encryption standard which involves government getting copies
of all the keys poses grave threats to privacy and civil liberties, and is
not acceptable in a free society.
        * Liberalization of export controls
Lifting export controls on cryptography will make the benefits of strong
cryptography widely available to our own citizens. U.S. hardware, software
and consumer electronics manufacturers will build encryption into
affordable products once they are given access to a global marketplace. Today's widespread availability of "raw" cryptographic technology both
inside and outside the United States shows that the technology will always
be available to "bad guys".
The real question is whether our policies will allow encryption to be built
into the fabric of our national and international infrastructure, to
provide significantly increased individual privacy, improved financial
privacy, increased financial security, enhanced freedom of association,
increased individual control over identity, improved security and integrity
of documents, contracts, and licenses, reduced fraud and counterfeiting,
the creation of significant new markets for buying and selling of
intellectual property, and a lessened ability to detect and prosecute
victimless crimes.
These benefits are not free, however.  EFF does recognize that new
communications technologies pose real challenges to the work of law
enforcement.  Just as the automobile, the airplane, and even the telephone
created new opportunities for criminal activity, and new difficulties for
law enforcement, encryption technology will certainly require changes in
traditional investigative techniques.  We also recognize that encryption
will prevent many of the online crimes that will likely occur without it. We further believe that these technologies will create new investigative
tools for law enforcement, even as they obsolete old ones.  Entering this
new environment, private industry, law enforcement, and private citizens
must work together to balance the requirements of both liberty and
security.  Finally, the export controls used today to attempt to control this
technology are probably not Constitutional under the First Amendment; if
the problems of uncontrolled export are too great, a means of control must
be found which does not restrict free expression.
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP TOWARD COMPREHENSIVE POLICY FRAMEWORK IS CRITICAL
The efforts of Congresswoman Maria Cantwell, Senator Patrick Leahy, and
other members of Congress, show that comprehensive policies on privacy,
security and competitiveness in digital communication technologies can only
be achieved with the active involvement of Congress.  Unilateral policy
efforts by the Executive branch, such as Clipper and misguided export
control policies, will not serve the broad interests of American citizens
and businesses.  So, we are pleased to see that the Vice-President has
pledged to work with the Congress and the private sector in shaping a
forward-looking policy.  We see the Vice-President's letter to
Congresswoman Cantwell as an important opening for dialogue on these
The principles of voluntariness and open standards announced in the Vice-
President's letter, as well as those mentioned here, must be incorporated
into legislation.  We believe that under the leadership of Senator Leahy,
Reps. Cantwell, Valentine, Brooks and others, this will be possible in the
next congress.  EFF is eager to work with the Congress, the Administration,
along with other private sector organizations to help formulate a new
policy.  EFF is also pleased to be part of the team of grass roots
activism, industry lobbying, and public interest advocacy which has yielded
real progress on these issues.

Quebec City, Canada, August 3, 1994--The U.S. Postal Service has
dramatically increased its commitment to the security of
communications on the NII, with the announcement of Postal
Electronic Commerce Services ("Postal ECS"), which will offer a
nationwide public key certification service for the authentication
of digital signatures used in paperless electronic commerce.  Richard Rothwell, Senior Director of Technology Integration for the
USPS, officially released the news today in Quebec City, in a paper
delivered to an international working group of the Information
Security Committee of the American Bar Association's Section of
Science and Technology, which has been developing guidelines for
public key certification authorities.
"Our initial implementation is based on the Digital Signature
Standard (DSS) Algorithm set; but our plan is to support other
cryptographic options such as RSA in the near future," Rothwell
Public key digital signatures serve to authenticate the originator
of a digital communication, validate the integrity of the message,
fix the time and date of the message, and prevent the sender from
subsequently repudiating the communication - all features which are
critical to increasing trust in electronic commerce.
The full text of the USPS announcement on Postal ECS follows, which
may be duplicated and disseminated widely, so long as the entire
text is included.       Address to Information Security Committee, EDI/IT Division

GOOD AFTERNOON
MY NAME IS RICHARD ROTHWELL.  I AM SENIOR DIRECTOR OF TECHNOLOGY
INTEGRATION FOR THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE.
I DOUBT THERE ARE MANY GROUPS MORE AWARE OF THE SWEEPING CHANGES
TAKING PLACE IN COMMUNICATIONS THAN THIS ONE, OR HOW THOSE
CHANGES AFFECT THE WAY THAT ALL OF US WILL DO BUSINESS IN THE
FUTURE.  TODAY I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU MY THOUGHTS ON THE ROLE
OF THE POSTAL SERVICE IN THIS NEW AGE, AND PARTICULARLY, THE ROLE
THAT WE ARE BEING ASKED TO ASSUME IN HELPING TO FACILITATE THE
EMERGING WORLD OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE.
THE POSTAL SERVICE WAS ESTABLISHED, AT THE BIRTH OF THE UNITED
STATES, WITH THE MISSION OF BINDING TOGETHER A DIVERSE AND FAR-
FLUNG NATION THROUGH THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE PEOPLE.  IT WAS,
AND IS, A BROAD-BASED MISSION.  OVER A CENTURY AGO, THEN ACTING
ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT WROTE THAT "THE MAKERS OF
THE CONSTITUTION ... HAD IN MIND THE COMPREHENSIVE VIEW WHICH
REGARDED POST OFFICES ... AS INSTRUMENTS FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF
INTELLIGENCE,"  A MISSION THEY EXPRESSED "IN VERY COMPREHENSIVE
TERMS..."   TODAY WE ARE BEING ASKED BY OUR CUSTOMERS TO CONSIDER
NEW WAYS OF CARRYING OUT THIS MISSION.  TODAY WE LIVE IN A
COMPLEX, COST CONSCIOUS, INTERDEPENDENT SOCIETY WHICH IS
DEVELOPING NEW ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AND RE-INVENTING
COMMERCIAL PRACTICES.  FOR MANY APPLICATIONS, THE NEW
EFFICIENCIES OF ELECTRONIC DATA COMMUNICATION, THE BENEFITS THAT
IT HAS PROVIDED TO ITS EARLY ADOPTERS, AND THE COMPETITIVE
PRESSURES THAT THIS EVOLUTION HAS CREATED ARE DRIVING
CORPORATIONS, GOVERNMENTS, AND INDIVIDUALS TO EXPLORE NEW WAYS OF
CONDUCTING BUSINESS, AND SERVING THEIR CUSTOMERS AND
YET, AS MANY EXPERTS HAVE NOTED, INCLUDING MANY OF YOU IN THIS
ROOM, DIGITAL FILES AS A RULE ARE NEITHER AS SECURE NOR AS
RELIABLE AS THEIR PAPER COUNTERPARTS.  DIGITAL FILES ARE DESIGNED
TO BE EASILY MANIPULATED BY USERS ON DIFFERENT COMPUTERS.  THIS
IS, OF COURSE, AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE EFFICIENCY THAT
ELECTRONIC COMMERCE CONVEYS.  BUT WITHOUT SOME METHOD OF SEALING
A DIGITAL FILE TO ESTABLISH ITS CONTENTS, AUTHOR, AND TIME OF
TRANSMITTAL, THE BENEFITS OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE WILL INEVITABLY
BE LIMITED TO HIGHLY STRUCTURED TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN PARTIES THAT
KNOW AND TRUST ON ANOTHER.  SUCH LIMITS WILL SEVERELY CONSTRAIN
OR WIPE OUT THE BENEFITS OF ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE.   A
RECENT ARTICLE IN GOVERNMENT COMPUTER NEWS NOTED THAT THE USE OF
TRADING PARTNER AGREEMENTS TO STRUCTURE EDI AGREEMENTS COULD
REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF HUNDREDS OF LAWYERS TO NEGOTIATE, WRITE,
AND ARGUE ABOUT THE AGREEMENTS JUST FOR GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT.
THIS IS EVIDENCE OF THE GREAT DEGREE OF TRANSACTIONAL FRICTION
THAT MUST INEVITABLY ACCOMPANY SUCH AN APPROACH. IF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IS NOT GOING TO BE LIMITED TO HIGHLY
STRUCTURED TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN WELL KNOWN AND TRUSTED PARTIES,
OTHER SOLUTIONS MUST BE DEVELOPED TO CREATE AN EFFECTIVE LEGAL
FRAMEWORK AND ELECTRONIC INFRASTRUCTURE.  ELECTRONIC
COMMUNICATION MEDIA CANNOT BECOME A RELIABLE BASIS FOR WIDESPREAD
BUSINESS USE WITHOUT A TRUSTED METHOD OF SEALING DIGITAL
CONTENTS, VERIFYING THE PARTIES INVOLVED, AND ESTABLISHING AN
OFFICIAL DATE AND TIME FOR THE TRANSACTION.  GOVERNMENT HAS SIMILAR NEEDS.  TRUST AND SECURITY ARE ESSENTIAL
TO THE SUCCESS OF THE NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE, THE
REFORM OF GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE, AND A NUMBER OF OTHER CRITICAL
FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTH CARE REFORM.
PERSONAL, EDUCATIONAL, LITERARY, AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE
TRAVELING ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY MUST BE ELECTRONICALLY
GUARDED SO THAT ALL CITIZENS ARE REASONABLY ASSURED OF THE
INTEGRITY OF THEIR RECORDS.  THE TIMELY DELIVERY OF IMPORTANT
ELECTRONIC INFORMATION, AND THE IDENTITY AND AUTHORITY OF THE
PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY COMMUNICATE ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT.  WITHOUT
TRUST AND SECURITY, ALL OF THE SUPERCOMPUTERS AND ALL OF THE
HIGH-SPEED NETWORKS IN THE WORLD CANNOT MAKE THE N.I.I. SUCCEED
ON THE BROAD FUNCTIONAL BASIS FOR WHICH IT WAS CONCEIVED.  AS ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS, THE UNITED STATES
POSTAL SERVICE SHARES MANY OF THE CONCERNS OF BOTH BUSINESS AND
GOVERNMENT.  THE POSTAL SERVICE MUST MANAGE TRANSACTIONS WITH
THOUSANDS OF ORGANIZATIONS ON A DAILY BASIS IN THE PROCESS OF
ANNUALLY DOING $49 BILLION OF BUSINESS MOVING 171 BILLION PIECES
OF MAIL.  BUT OUR CONCERNS ARE NO DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF ANY
LARGE ENTERPRISE IN THE WORLD TODAY TRYING TO MAKE ITS OPERATIONS
MORE EFFICIENT.
THERE ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE MANY IN THIS ROOM WHO DO NOT BELIEVE
IN THE NEED FOR A MECHANISM FOR ESTABLISHING THE RELIABILITY OF
AN ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION, AND BINDING AN INDIVIDUAL TO IT. I
THEREFORE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO CONDUCT A
DETAILED EXPLORATION OF THE ADVANTAGES OF BUILDING A PUBLIC KEY
INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SOLUTION TO THE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS OF
PROVIDING SECURITY FOR ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS.  WHAT I WILL TALK TO
YOU ABOUT IS THE ROLE THE POSTAL SERVICE CAN PLAY IN PROVIDING
THESE TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED.    THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY THE POSTAL SERVICE IS DEVELOPING
PLATFORMS FOR PROVIDING SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS.  FIRST, OUR
GENERAL DUTY TO "BIND THE NATION TOGETHER THROUGH THE PERSONAL,
EDUCATIONAL, LITERARY, AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE OF THE PEOPLE"
HAS TAKEN ON NEW MEANING NOW THAT A HYBRID INFORMATION HIGHWAY,
PART PAPER AND PART ELECTRONIC, HAS BECOME A REALITY AND WILL
CONTINUE TO BE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT DECADE.  SECOND, NOT
SURPRISINGLY, OUR CUSTOMERS ARE ASKING US TO PLAY AN EXPANDED
ROLE IN FACILITATING PAPER AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE BECAUSE WE
HAVE UNIQUE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES TO ACCOMPLISH THE
TASK.  AND THIRD, WE HAVE TO DEVELOP ELECTRONIC SERVICES TO MEET
OUR CUSTOMERS' NEEDS FOR FASTER, MORE EFFICIENT HANDLING OF THEIR
PRODUCTS. A CORE FUNCTION OF THE POSTAL SERVICE WILL REMAIN THE
TRANSMISSION OF HARD COPY MESSAGES TO AND FROM RESIDENCES AND
BUSINESSES IN AMERICA.  AS I'VE NOTED, THAT FUNCTION FLOWS OUT OF
OUR CORE MISSION TO BIND THE NATION TOGETHER.  THE POSTAL SERVICE
HAS OTHER MISSIONS AS WELL.  WE ARE TASKED TO PROVIDE SERVICE ON
A UNIVERSAL BASIS TO PATRONS IN ALL AREAS AND TO ALL COMMUNITIES.
WE ARE REQUIRED TO USE EVERY EFFORT TO PROVIDE EFFICIENT AND
EXPEDITIOUS DELIVERY OF CORRESPONDENCE.  WE ARE CHARGED WITH
PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF POSTAL CUSTOMERS AND MAY NOT MAKE
AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC BY ANY MEANS OR FOR ANY PURPOSE ANY
MAILING OR OTHER LIST OF NAMES OR ADDRESSES, PAST OR PRESENT, OF
POSTAL PATRONS OR OTHER PERSONS.  AND WE ARE CHARGED WITH
MAINTAINING THE SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE MAILS, AND
INVESTIGATING POSTAL OFFENSES AND CIVIL MATTERS RELATING TO THE
POSTAL SERVICE.   AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THESE MISSIONS, THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS AT
LEAST THREE ASSETS WHICH MAKE US A LIKELY CANDIDATE TO PLAY A
ROLE IN THIS EMERGING FIELD.  FIRST, THE POSTAL SERVICE ALREADY
HAS MUCH OF THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY
TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF WIDESPREAD ELECTRONIC COMMERCE.
SECOND, OUR SIZE AND WIDELY DISTRIBUTED RESOURCES GIVE US THE
PRACTICAL TOOLS TO PROVIDE A MUCH-NEEDED SERVICE ON A UNIVERSAL
BASIS.  THIRD, WE ARE UNIQUELY SITUATED TO PROTECT CORE VALUES
SUCH AS SECURITY AND INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY AS WELL AS UNIVERSAL
ACCESS TO THE TOOLS OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE.
LET ME DISCUSS THESE ONE AT A TIME. FIRST, THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS THE LEGAL STRUCTURE TO PERFORM THE
DUTIES OF MANAGING A CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY.  THE POST OFFICE WAS
ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED BY THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS AS THE UNITED
STATE'S FIRST INFORMATION HIGHWAY.  FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS, A
SOPHISTICATED REGIME OF STATUTES, REGULATIONS, AND POLICIES HAS
DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH ENABLES SECURE,
EFFICIENT, AND INEXPENSIVE TRANSMISSION OF PAPER COMMUNICATIONS.
FOR 200 YEARS, THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE HAS CERTIFIED
MAIL, SEALED IT WITH THE POWER AND AUTHORITY OF LAW, PROVIDED
RESPONSIBLE AND TIMELY MAIL DELIVERY, AND INSURED PATRONS AGAINST
LOSS OR THEFT.  A RELIABLE AND TRUSTED MAIL SYSTEM REMARKABLY
FREE OF CORRUPTION OR ABUSE HAS ACCOMPANIED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A
SYSTEM OF COMMERCE IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS SECOND TO NONE
IN THE WORLD.
FOR HARDCOPY COMMUNICATIONS, THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK IS ALREADY IN
PLACE TO HANDLE ISSUES SUCH AS LIABILITY, INDEMNITY,
CONFIDENTIALITY, FRAUDULENT USE, THEFT, DEFINITE DATING, ETC.  A
SIMILAR FRAMEWORK WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT ELECTRONIC
COMMERCE.  CUSTOMERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE MAY
BE IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO PROVIDE PART OF THAT STRUCTURE.  FOR
EXAMPLE, SOME CUSTOMERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THEY ARE CONCERNED
WITH THEIR OWN CAPACITY TO HANDLE LIABILITY ISSUES, AND THAT THE
POSTAL SERVICE PROVIDES A READY-MADE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.
OTHERS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE CONFIDENTIALITY PROBLEMS
INHERENT IN DEALING WITH OTHER COMPANIES, WHILE STILL OTHERS HAVE
ASKED FOR A REGIME FOR CONTROLLING FRAUD WHICH IS AS STRONG AND
CONVENIENT AS THAT IN PLACE FOR MAIL FRAUD.  THUS, THE STRONG
LEGAL FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED FOR HANDLING PAPER COMMUNICATIONS CAN
PROVIDE SIMILAR BENEFITS FOR ELECTRONIC COMMERCE.  SECOND, OUR CUSTOMERS ARE ASKING FOR OUR ASSISTANCE IN THIS AREA
BECAUSE WE HAVE UNIQUE PRACTICAL ASSETS, INCLUDING:
    THE 40,000 RETAIL FACILITIES DISTRIBUTED NATIONWIDE
    UNIVERSAL PRESENCE AND THE CAPACITY TO ACHIEVE
          SIGNIFICANT SCALE
    THE RESOURCES OF AN EXISTING NATIONAL INFORMATION
          INFRASTRUCTURE
    A VERY STRONG VERIFICATION PROCESS CURRENTLY USED FOR
          PASSPORTS, THAT INVOLVES PROOF OF ID AND OTHER
          INFORMATION TO A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE.
    THE EXPERIENCE, POLICIES, AND ABILITY TO ARCHIVE
          RECORDS WITHOUT RISK THAT THEY WOULD BE USED FOR
          COLLATERAL COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.
THE POSTAL SERVICE IS ALSO A REMARKABLY LONG-LIVED ORGANIZATION,
AND THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE STRUGGLED WITH ARCHIVING POLICIES WILL
RECOGNIZE THAT TO BE AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE.  AS BOB JUENEMAN HAS
SAID ON THE INTERNET, "CERTIFICATES 'R US" MAY BE GONE TOMORROW.
IF YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT A CERTIFICATE WAS REGISTERED ON A
CERTAIN DATE, AND YOU ARE SEEKING AN APPROPRIATE ARCHIVING
FACILITY, YOU CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE THE POSTAL SERVICE WILL STILL
BE AROUND TO SUPPORT YOUR REQUEST.
A THIRD STRENGTH THE POSTAL SERVICE BRINGS TO ENABLING ELECTRONIC
COMMERCE, AND ANOTHER REASON THAT OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE ASKED FOR
HELP, IS OUR CAPACITY TO CREATE CERTIFICATE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
THAT CAN REACH VIRTUALLY EVERY COMMUNITY IN AMERICA, BECAUSE WE
ALREADY HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL PRESENCE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.  WE CAN
THEREFORE PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO THE QUESTION OF HOW TO PUT THE
TOOLS OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE, SUCH AS CERTIFICATES, INTO THE
HANDS OF EVERYONE.  THERE ARE MANY OBSTACLES TO PREVENT CITIZENS
FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE BENEFITS OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE.
CURRENTLY THERE ARE TECHNOLOGICAL, GEOGRAPHIC, ECONOMIC, AND
KNOWLEDGE BARRIERS WHICH PREVENT PEOPLE FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE
BENEFITS OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE.  TO PROVIDE UNIVERSAL SERVICE TO
ELECTRONIC COMMERCE WE MUST PROVIDE ACCESS WHICH IS UNIVERSALLY
USABLE AND UBIQUITOUS AND SCALABLE.  BY PROVIDING A SOLUTION TO
SOME OF THESE ACCESS PROBLEMS, THE POSTAL SERVICE MAY HAVE AN
IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN ENSURING THAT FUTURE COMMUNICATIONS IN
AMERICA PROVIDE A CONTINUING FRAMEWORK FOR SUSTAINING A
DEMOCRATIC, PARTICIPATORY SOCIETY. THUS, MANY OF THE INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES NEEDED BY AN ENTITY
WISHING TO TAKE PART IN CERTIFICATE ISSUANCE AND MANAGEMENT
ALREADY EXIST IN THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE.  THE POSTAL
SERVICE WAS ESTABLISHED TO PROVIDE VERY SIMILAR SERVICES FOR THE
SUPPORT OF CORRESPONDENCE WHEN THE PHYSICAL FRONTIER WAS CHAOTIC
AND HARD TO REACH.  IT IS READY TO PROVIDE SIMILAR SERVICES ON
THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER.
AS THE POSTMASTER GENERAL HAS INFORMED CONGRESS, WE ARE ACTIVELY
SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE N.I.I. TO FACILITATE THE
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR OWN BUSINESS AND TO HELP US CARRY OUT OUR
MISSION.  ON MARCH 24, THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TESTIFIED BEFORE
THE SENATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE THAT "WORKING WITH OTHER FEDERAL
AGENCIES, WE MAY BE ABLE TO DEVELOP AN ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
SYSTEM."  HE ALSO NOTED THAT, THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A KIOSK
PROGRAM THAT MIGHT CARRY OUT POSTAL TRANSACTIONS AND PERHAPS ALSO
DISSEMINATE INFORMATION FROM OTHER AGENCIES, OUR POSTAL LOBBIES
COULD BECOME "ON-RAMPS" TO THE ELECTRONIC SUPER HIGHWAY. THE POSTMASTER GENERAL HIGHLIGHTED TWO IMPORTANT AREAS IN WHICH
THE POSTAL SERVICE MAY BE HELPFUL: SERVING THE REQUIREMENTS OF
OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND PROVIDING UNIVERSAL SERVICE TO
THOSE CITIZENS WHO ARE IN DANGER OF BEING LEFT OUT OF THE
INFORMATION REVOLUTION.  TO THESE HE MIGHT HAVE ADDED A THIRD,
EQUALLY IMPORTANT AREA:  PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF AMERICAN
CITIZENS.  THIS CONCERN IS DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN POSTAL TRADITION
AND STATUTE.  WHEN WE SPEAK OF THE SECURITY OF ELECTRONIC
COMMERCE WE SHOULD NOT MISS THE WAY IN WHICH COMMERCIAL SECURITY
AND INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY ARE INTERCONNECTED CONCEPTS. WHILE IT IS TOO EARLY TO KNOW WHAT PRECISELY LIES AHEAD, LET ME
SHARE WITH YOU A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEMS WE ARE
DEVELOPING, BOTH FOR OUR OWN USE AND FOR THAT OF OUR CUSTOMERS.
THE POSTAL SERVICE IS USING PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY, AND
RELATED TECHNOLOGIES, TO DEVELOP A PUBLIC KEY CERTIFICATION
AUTHORITY AND A SET OF ASSOCIATED TRUSTED THIRD PARTY SERVICES
WHICH WE CALL POSTAL ELECTRONIC COMMERCE SERVICES (POSTAL ECS).
WHEN INITIALLY DEPLOYED, POSTAL ECS WILL PROVIDE A BASIS FOR
ELECTRONIC ASSURANCES WITHIN AND AMONG GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND
BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS.  IN
PARTICULAR, THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS DEVELOPED THE ABILITY TO:
    ISSUE PUBLIC KEY CERTIFICATES AND STORE THEM IN A
          PUBLIC DIRECTORY;
    PROVIDE FOR THE "SEALING" OF SELECTED DOCUMENTS OR
          OTHER ELECTRONIC OBJECTS AND ASSOCIATING THEM WITH A
          DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND A TRUSTED TIME AND DATE STAMP;
    PROVIDE SERVICES FOR PUBLIC KEY CERTIFICATE PUBLICATION
          AND REVOCATION; AND,
    PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO ENCRYPT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
          MOVING BETWEEN THE USER ENVIRONMENT AND THE POSTAL ECS
          MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
    FINALLY, PROVIDE NEAR REAL-TIME ACCESS TO CERTIFICATES
          AND THEIR STATUS.
THE CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY WILL ISSUE AND MANAGE X.509 PUBLIC
KEY CERTIFICATES CONTAINING A PERSON'S X.500 DISTINGUISHED NAME,
PUBLIC KEY, AND OTHER IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.  USERS CAN THEN
RETRIEVE A CERTIFICATE FROM THE POSTAL SERVICE, AND USE ITS
PUBLIC KEY TO AUTHENTICATE A DIGITAL SIGNATURE GENERATED BY THE
COMPLEMENTARY PRIVATE KEY. THE CORRESPONDENCE SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE SYSTEM IS THE POSTAL
ECS SEAL WHICH PROVIDES USERS WITH A VALIDATION OF THE ORIGINATOR
BASED ON HIS OR HER DIGITAL SIGNATURE.  WE ALSO PROVIDE A POSTAL
SERVICE DIGITAL SIGNATURE ON THE DIGEST OF AN ELECTRONIC OBJECT
THAT ASSURES THAT IT CANNOT BE CHANGED WITHOUT DETECTION.  WE
ALSO PROVIDE THE POSTAL SERVICE DIGITAL SIGNATURE ON A DATE AND
TIME STAMP THAT WE SUPPLY TO ENABLE PROOF OF EXISTENCE AT A POINT
IN TIME AND WE PROVIDE ARCHIVING FOR THOSE DATE AND TIME STAMPS.
FINALLY, WE PROVIDE NEAR REAL-TIME ACCESS TO CERTIFICATES AND
THEIR STATUS.  THIS ALLOWS A USER TO GET UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION
ON THE VALIDITY OF CERTIFICATES, AND REMOVES THE NEED FOR USERS
TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN CERTIFICATE REVOCATION LISTS.
THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS IMPLEMENTED THE CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY
SERVICES, THE CORRESPONDENCE SERVICES AND THE SUPPORTING
DIRECTORY ON A HOST COMPUTER SYSTEM IN ONE OF OUR MAJOR
PRODUCTION DATA CENTERS.  WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED THREE POSTAL
SERVICE-LICENSED USER AGENTS AS REFERENCE MODELS TO BE INSTALLED
ON END USER WORKSTATIONS THAT WILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO POSTAL ECS
SERVICES.  THEY RUN ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS-BASED PC~S AND ACCESS
POSTAL ECS SERVICES VIA E-MAIL (EITHER INTERNET OR X.400).  WE
ARE ALSO WORKING ON AN INTERACTIVE DIAL-UP COMMUNICATION
ALTERNATIVE AND EXPECT THIS TO BE AVAILABLE SHORTLY.
THESE USER AGENTS CONTAIN STANDARD PROGRAMMING INTERFACES THAT
LINK USER APPLICATIONS, CRYPTOGRAPHIC ROUTINES, AND ECS SERVICES
TOGETHER.  OUR INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION IS BASED ON THE DIGITAL
SIGNATURE STANDARD (DSS) ALGORITHM SET; BUT OUR PLAN IS TO
SUPPORT OTHER CRYPTOGRAPHIC OPTIONS SUCH AS RSA IN THE NEAR
WE ARE NOW MOVING FROM DEVELOPMENTAL WORK TO ACTUAL PROOF OF
CONCEPT PILOT TESTING OF THESE SERVICES BOTH INTERNALLY IN THE
USPS AND WITH OUR GOVERNMENT AGENCY PARTNERS.  OUR PLANS WILL
EVOLVE AS WE GAIN EXPERIENCE FROM THESE INITIAL PILOT TESTS AND
CONTINUE TO TALK WITH CUSTOMERS, AND EXPERTS IN ENCRYPTION,
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, AND COMPUTER SCIENCE.  WE HAVE SHARED OUR
PLANS WITH CONGRESS, THE ADMINISTRATION, AND THE MEDIA.  AND WE
HAVE ASKED OURSELVES THREE KEY QUESTIONS:
    IS THIS INITIATIVE CRITICAL TO OUR MISSION AND OUR
          RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC?
    DO OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE A NEED FOR OUR PARTICIPATION?
          AND,
    WOULD THE COSTS OF PROVIDING THESE SERVICES BE BALANCED
          BY POTENTIAL REVENUES?
CERTAINLY THE RESPONSES THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED TO DATE MORE THAN
JUSTIFIES OUR VIEW THAT THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH WE SHOULD
CONTINUE TO BE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT.
BEFORE CONCLUDING, LET ME DIRECTLY ADDRESS A CONTROVERSIAL
PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION ABOUT CERTIFICATE MANAGEMENT SO YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE SEE AS THE FUTURE WORLD OF ELECTRONIC
COMMERCE.  THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF DEBATE ABOUT THE
RELATIVE ADVANTAGES OF HIERARCHIAL VERSUS PEER-TO-PEER OR ONE-
LEVEL MODELS FOR MANAGEMENT OF DIGITAL SIGNATURE.  TO SOME
EXTENT, I BELIEVE THIS DEBATE MISSES THE POINT.  THE SYSTEM FOR
MANAGING X.500 CERTIFICATES THAT WILL EVENTUALLY BE ADOPTED WILL
BE ADOPTED ONLY BECAUSE IT MEETS THE BUSINESS NEEDS OF THE USERS.
BECAUSE THE COMPLEX COMMUNICATION NEEDS OF THE FUTURE WILL
REQUIRE FLEXIBILITY TO MEET INDIVIDUAL DESIRES, SOME MIX OF
HIERARCHIAL AND PEER-TO-PEER OR FLAT MANAGEMENT SCHEMES WILL BE
WHAT THE RECIPIENT OF AN ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT SIGNED WITH A
DIGITAL SIGNATURE NEEDS TO KNOW IS HOW MUCH WEIGHT TO GIVE THAT
SIGNATURE -- OR, IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT ACTIONS TO TAKE BASED ON AN
EVALUATION OF THE SENDER.  THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME THING THAT IS
DECIDED EVERY DAY BY PEOPLE -- SHOULD WE SELL SECURITIES TO A
VOICE OVER THE PHONE?  SHOULD WE PLACE AN ORDER WITH A NEW
SALESMAN?  GIVEN THE INFINITE VARIETY OF POSSIBLE TRANSACTIONS
AND ENCOUNTERS, THERE IS NO POINT IN TRYING TO IMPOSE ON
ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS A SINGLE PARADIGM FOR AUTHENTICATION.
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ASSURANCE, AND DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES, WILL
BE NECESSARY FOR DIFFERENT USES.  WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THE
PARTIES TO THE TRANSACTION ARE AWARE OF THE LEVEL OF ASSURANCE
PROVIDED. THE POSTAL SERVICE CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE IN FILLING SOME SPECIFIC
NEEDS IN THE CERTIFICATE ARENA, BUT IT HAS NO INTENTION OF
CONTROLLING OR DOMINATING THAT ARENA.  FOR THE NEAR FUTURE THE
UNIVERSE OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE MANY
DIFFERENT GALAXIES.  MANY VARYING CONCEPTS AND SERVICES WILL BE
ABLE TO MAKE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS.  MANY OTHER ENTITIES WILL
PROVIDE SERVICES IN THIS AREA: AS VICE PRESIDENT GORE HAS NOTED
IN NUMEROUS SPEECHES, THERE IS A ROLE FOR BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC
ENTITIES.  WE PLAN TO PROVIDE SERVICES BASED UPON IDENTIFIED
NEEDS, WHICH CUSTOMERS WILL DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL USE.
IN KEEPING WITH THE PHILOSOPHY I HAVE ARTICULATED, LET ME SAY
THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE, IN ANY DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PRODUCTS,
INTENDS TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE CRYPTOGRAPHIC PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET
PLACE.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL NOT COMPETE WITH NETWORK SERVICE
PROVIDERS, NOR WILL WE BECOME A NETWORK OR CARRIER.
IN DEVELOPING THESE SERVICES, WE ARE KEENLY INTERESTED IN THE
WORK OF THIS GROUP.  WHILE THE TECHNOLOGY AND SCALE ISSUES SEEM
TO US TO BE MANAGEABLE, WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE STILL MANY
LEGAL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE DESIGN OF A
PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT SERVICE MIGHT BEST WORK.
THE LIABILITY ISSUES ARE NOT YET COMPLETELY CLEAR, AND THE DUTIES
OF EACH ENTITY IN SUCH AN INFRASTRUCTURE NEED TO BE ARTICULATED.
AS CUSTOMERS SEEK OUR SERVICES, WE WILL HAVE TO FACE QUESTIONS OF
SCALABILITY, INVESTMENT, AND THE REGULATORY ISSUES ASSOCIATED
WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW SERVICE.  CAN THE SERVICE BE
MANAGED?  WHAT INVESTMENT WILL BE REQUIRED?  HOW WILL REGULATORS
HAVE US PRESENT THE SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC AND AT WHAT PRICE?
WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE EXCHANGE OF VIEWS THAT THIS FORUM MAKES
POSSIBLE.  WE ALL HAVE MUCH TO LEARN IN THIS AREA, AND I BELIEVE
WE SHOULD WELCOME THE FACT THAT WE LIVE IN SUCH INTERESTING
TIMES.

EFF HEARING SUMMARY                                     September 14, 1994
HOUSE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE CONSIDERS DIGITAL TELEPHONY PROPOSAL
On Tuesday September 13 the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on
Telecommunications and Finance held a hearing to examine the Digital
Telephony legislation.  The bill (H.R. 4922/S. 2375), introduced in August
by Representative Don Edwards (D-CA) and Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT),
would require telecommunications carriers to ensure that advanced
technology does not prevent law enforcement from conducting authorized
electronic surveillance.  Tuesday's hearing focused mainly on questions of
cost.  More specifically, whether all future costs associated with law
enforcement surveillance capability should be borne by private industry or
the government.
Witnesses appearing before the panel:
Louis Freeh,      FBI Director                 Tom Reilly,       Middelsex County (Mass) District Attorney
Richard Metzger,  FCC Common Carrier Bureau Chief
Daniel Bart,      Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) V.P. Jerry Berman,     Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Policy Director Roy Neel,         United States Telephone Association (USTA) Pres. & CEO   Thomas Wheeler,   Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA)
                  Pres.                     TIA's Dan Bart and USTA's Roy Neel joined EFF's Jerry Berman in questioning
the necessity of any digital telephony legislation, expressing concern that
the FBI has not adequately substantiated its case that its surveillance
efforts are being frustrated by advanced telecommunications technologies. However, all agreed that the Edwards/Leahy bill is substantially improved
over previous FBI proposals, noting its increased privacy protections,
prohibition of government design authority, and requirements for public
processes.  On the issue of cost, TIA's Bart, USTA's Neel, and CTIA's
Wheeler all argued that forcing industry to incur compliance costs may slow
technological innovation and the development of the NII.    EFF's Berman also argued for government reimbursement, adding that,  "if
the telecommunications industry is responsible for all future compliance
costs, it may be forced to accept solutions which short-cut the privacy and
security of telecommunications networks".  He further noted that linking
compliance to government reimbursement has the benefit of providing public
oversight and accountability for law enforcement surveillance capability.
FBI Director Freeh stated that passage of the digital telephony legislation
this year is a "drop-dead issue for us", and praised the telecommunications
industry for their cooperation and good faith efforts to craft a balanced
compromise.  While acknowledging that the costs associated with meeting the
requirements of the legislation remain a significant issue, Freeh indicated
that this question should be left to Congress to determine.
Many Subcommittee members, apparently swayed by the FBI's intense lobbying
campaign for the bill (which included many personal visits by the FBI
Director), praised the privacy protections in the legislation and committed
themselves to working through the remaining issues in order to pass the
bill this year.  As Subcommittee Chairman Edward Markey (D-MA) stated in
his opening statement, the task of the Subcommittee is to "come up with a
policy that 1) protects the privacy interests of our citizens, 2) is
mindful of the limited financial resources of taxpayers or ratepayers, 3)
meets the legitimate needs of law enforcement, and 4) does not unduly
interfere with our telecommunications industry, which is racing to the
future with advances in communications technology".
COST -- WHO PAYS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITY?
At issue are the provisions in the legislation that require
telecommunications carriers to deploy features and services which enable
law enforcement to conduct authorized electronic surveillance.  The current
bill authorizes $500 million to cover the cost of upgrading existing
equipment during the first 4 years after the bill is enacted.  Carriers
would be required to modify their equipment, at the governments expense, or
face fines of up to $10,000 per day for each day in violation.  Although
the FBI maintains that $500 million is enough to cover all upgrade costs,
the industry has repeatedly stated that the costs will be five to ten times
higher.  The industry is requesting that their liability under the bill be
linked to government reimbursement -- that the government should get what
it pays for and no more.
After four years, the bill stipulates that carriers must ensure that all
new features and services meet the wiretap requirements.  The FBI has
argued that future compliance costs will be minimal, because these costs
will be addressed at the design stage and will be spread throughout the
industry.  The industry maintains it is impossible to estimate compliance
costs for technologies which are not even on the drawing boards.   If the
costs are substantial, as industry believes, forcing industry to incur
those costs may slow the deployment of advanced technology to the public. Therefore, the industry believes that the government should be responsible
for all future compliance costs.
PUBLIC ACCOUNTIBILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SURVEILLANCE COSTS IS ESSENTIAL

Any more info on this appreciated.
From EduPage, 09/14/94:
"PAYDAY ON THE INTERNET
A new company called CyberCash hopes to break the impasse in conducting
commercial transactions over the Internet by offering a secure electronic
payment system. "We want to make the Internet safe for commerce... and
provide safe passage from cyberspace into the banking world," says the
company's president and co-founder. CyberCash will allow users to ask their
banks to set aside money in a "digital purse." The funds are then
transferred to the merchant when an item is purchased. CyberCash would
receive a small fee for each transaction. The company is still working on
security measures, and must persuade banks that the system protects privacy
and is tamper-proof. (Wall Street Journal 9/13/94 B1)"

Forwarded message:
    Here's a situation in which "profiling" by a government agency is
    already causing a problem.      Recall that recently on <eff-activists) there was brief discussion
    regarding the use of "profiles" in advertising efforts, in the context
    of interactive TV.
    Some participants favored what was perceived as a probable improvement     in the efficiency of such advertising.  Others saw distinct dangers,
    especially if profiles were marketed or traded among private sector     entities, or if government became more involved.     This particular situation is quite disturbing because it involves a
    state tax agency, and as everyone can appreciate, here is an example
    of where one is effectively presumed guilty until proven innocent, and
    is subject to asset seizure pending resolution as well as possible
    forfeiture.
    A correspondent is trying to defend himself against some aggressive     actions by the AZ Department of Revenue.  He has discovered that AZ     Revised Statutes section 42-117 permits the DoR, at its discretion, to     assess a personal income tax which is based on a "statistically valid     sampling method."  Although this option is seldom used, it is being     applied in his case due to partial loss of records during a move.      In other words, your AZ tax can be based on your profile, irrespective
    of your income or expenses.
    Worse, AZ DoR cites ARS 42-113 through -115 as requiring one to keep     records for four years after filing.  Yet it asserts that there is no
    statute of limitations for audits - it can audit a filing at any time,
    and can presumably apply the statistical sampling method retroactively
    if it so desires.
    Obviously, this situation goes well beyond profiling to determine who     to audit.  These and other, equally onerous provisions comprise a pit
    of despair.  Ironically, DoR asserts that "all laws are presumed to be
    constitutional."
    The U.S. military is also involved in profiling, which is probably not
    much of a surprise because the military is often used as a test bed
    for social engineering experiments anyway.
    New ID is being issued to retired and current members of the military
    and their dependents, and to commissioned officers in the U.S. Public
    Health Service.  The new ID is replete with a digitized photo, two bar
    codes and what amounts to a kind of PIN linked to the SSAN.  It is
    intended to be machine-readable and linked to local and central
    databases.
    It's also a bit of an eye-opener to note that it is expected to     replace ID used for -other- than official business as well, like club
    cards and health care access cards.  If it's not in your profile or if     the money is not in your account, you can't do_it/have_it.  Moreover,     you'll probably get automatically reported for followup investigation     to determine willfulness and intent.     Does unrestrained profiling start to look a little ugly by now?  It     ought to.  If there's money to be made, or power to be wielded,     neither Constitutional law nor existing statutory law holds much sway.

We've not "bowed out" on this bill, it's just not significant enough a threat (yet) to warrant stirring up a lot of activism about it - which would detract from the focus on the CDA and it's clones.
We'll be tracking this bill and will certain help form a campaign against it if it looks to be going anywhere. In the mean time, we're issuing an analysis of it, and will keep the net informed.

I'd agree with the gist of Shabbir's entire message, except the last sentence, which I think needs some qualification.  Trying to fight every useful fight right now *is* counter-productive, because we're not at a stage yet where any of our organizations, or our coalitional meta-organization, can handle the load.  And the grassroots activist
infrastructure of the net can't handle it either.  But, that's not the way it should be.  We need to, and if we all work at it, we will, get to the state at which we can handle the load, and can fight all the good fights.
Part of what's needed is, frankly, for folks like those reading this message to take a little time out from endless arguments on newsgroups and mailing lists, from all the entertainment and fund, and become a little more politically active so we can preserve the possibility of having any fun at all.  How many of you are organizing groups like EF-Houston or VTW or SEA on a local or state basis?  I don't imagine many virtual hands are raising.  Hop to it folks.  This is no a one-dimensional fight, it's three dimensional.  You've got lobbying and national-level policy work being done, but local grassroots organizing via the net is still in a larval stage, and needs to be advanced. So does coordinated response to crap journalism and lack of serious coverage of the issues we find important.  Get in touch if you're interested in helping start local groups.  I'll keep a geographical list and try to put fairly close matches in contact with eachother.            Stanton McCandlish

Sure you do: Goodlatte's more direct prohibition on the Exec. branch mandating Key Escrow.  What's the problem here?  We know Goodlatte's version, on this provision at very least, is better. Why can't we just agree that it is, and support that?  Goodlatte's bill isn't competing with Leahy's, they were introduced simultaneously in different chambers, and are intended to get the same message across. I can't see a problem with saying "we like this particular phrasing better, let's have it in both versions."  The entire point of all this is to have the same bill on both sides of Congress anyway.  It can either happen early, or (on the off chance it ever gets that far) in conference committee. Here we have a large say. In conf. cmte. we have almost no say.  Again, what's the problem?
What are we arguing about?
I disagree.  A better thing we can write into law is to simultanously have rights reaffirmed, and send a more direct message to the Admin that it cannot tread here.
Let's not hard sell flawed parts of it, when fixes are not just available but already introduced as "live" legislation.
No kidding.
I expect either an attempt to mandate escrow, a worsening of the export controls, and/or an all-out assault on American's rights to encrypt at all, or without some kind of worse-than-GAK registry or licensing.  If not all of the above.

As our statement on the bill made clear, *EFF does not support the Leahy bill*, nor do we endorse it, like it, find it useful or any other synonym.
We're happy to see the issues raise again, a la Cantwell, but we specifically recommended simple and complete deregulation. As our co-founder John Gilmore points out, the Leahy bill as written pre-supposes Congressional authority to legislate in this are, and Executive authority to regulate under that legislation. These are notions that we, and Phil Karn, are challenging in court with Constitutional tests we are throwing at the ITAR export regs.

A problem here is that the *same* services and capabilities that permit anonymous speech in private permit anonymous speech in public. Compromising the latter compromises the former as well.
Unless chaining of remailers is made manadatory and automatic, this is unlikely to work. CoS had little difficulty getting anon.penet.fi's logs, and getting a preliminary ruling against online anonymity from the Finnish courts.
You have to have an anonymizing system that crosses a dozen or so national boundaries to make such an attack infeasible for most large organizations.  You'd need a system that crossed 50 or more widely disparate jurisdictions to make it infeasible to large intelligence or law enforcement agencies, and even then you'd have to NOT have broad international agreements, such as you'd called for or it would be trivial to force all the remailers in the chain to cough up personally identifiable information.
This is already true.
That's what bugs me - if there are some kind of sanctions coming from a governmental body (I may be misinterpreting you here), that's probably enough to kill private and well as public anonymity on the Net.
Incidentally, if something does happen from a governmental direction to kill online anonymity, it will probably be readily broadenable to all other media.

Black Unicorn typed:
I didn't say you were more mistaken than anyone or anything else. I'm not aware of a mistakenometer with which to make such a measurement.
I pointed out your assumption that "It is clear that the personal beliefs of those involved in EFF are those of compromise, present day politics, and a general lack of moral fiber" is not in fact "clear" at all, because you have insuffient information to make such a statement.
You don't even have to belive my remark that others in EFF have very pro-anonymity positions - you categorization of EFF is still logically bankrupt, because you don't have enough facts to make it.
The board is not almost 100% pro-anonymity.  There are widely differing opinions on the topic, and many board members have not directly wrestled with this issue before at all. I've seen some opinions shift in the space of a few messages.  This should clearly illustrate why there is no
official position yet. Some EFFers are not only not in agreement with eachother on this, but aren't sure where they stand at all.  This is the first time the issue has come up for the board as a whole since early 1995, and the board's composition is very different now.  This is the same process EFF goes through every time an issue comes up on which we have no position. Sometimes a position is agreed upon, and there we are, but sometimes no position is taken, as is still the case with intellectual property. In cases like that, we look at what happens on a case by case basis, rather than categorically.  (That is to say, even on stuff where we have no position, if something happens that harms the public interest we do not feel any obligation not to act simply because we lack a position on the meta-issue.)
It will take some time to formuate a position on it. Personally, I am confident that if EFF takes a position on online anonymity, it will be the positive stance you would expect from us.  It is also likely to be tempered with a discussion of responsibility issues, just like every other EFF position. This is not a "sellout" or a "compromise" just a recognization of fact: anonymity does have costs associated with it, such as the ability to defame without the defamed party having much recourse other than contradiction. Such costs should be stated openly, not lied about or ignored.  If EFF or other organizations pretend there are no costs or belittle concerns about costs, we undermine everything we are working for - we undermine the public interest and individual liberty.
That's fine. I do think you should wonder. But wondering and making unfounded accusations are different things.  It's one thing to say, "I wonder if Black Unicorn has good moral fiber whatever that is, and in fact I suspect he doesn't" (hypothetically, mind you), but it's quite another to say "Black Unicorn has no moral fiber!" (whatever moral fiber might be.)
Don't be surprised if it happens.  Also don't be surprised if it doesn't happen.  In EFF's 6+ years, no clear consensus on anonymity has yet evolved within any version of EFF's board and staff.  DO be surprised if you see EFF take an official position against anonymity. If that happens, I'll start looking for another job.  I'm confident it won't happen, or I'd probably already be looking for another job.
I'd like to see that too, but it may be a while in comming. That's a very good question.  EFF has, the entire time I've been with it, and before that the entire time I was observing it (that is, ~1992 to present) been quite supportive of anonymity, in ways that range from relying on facets of the NAACP case in our own CDA challenge, to defending online anonymity when being interviewed by the press, to providing publicly available materials (e.g. at  on anonymity including remailer lists and FAQs, to having a link on our "other interesting sites" page to the WWW remailer gateway, to permitting anonymous posts to all of our public mailing lists.  I can't think of any EFF statement against anonymity,
and even Esther's personal statement is not against anonymity, just advising caution and noting that there are many unresolved concerns in this area.
It's certainly your right to not support us.  I'm sad that you won't, but it is beyond anything I can do anything about. Positions on issues take time to evolve.  Again, I think you're making unfounded assumptions. The fact that Dyson has questions about the balance of the value and cost of online anonymity does not indicate a "statist bent". Hell, *I* have questions about that balance. For myself, I've found adequate answers, and have come to the conclusion that even if anonymity on the net were abused 1000x more than it is now, it would still be better to have anonymity than to not have it.
But I have to let other people come to that conclusion themselves, with my help when appropriate. I can't find any value in demonizing others who've not come to that conclusion, even if if I do find value in severely criticizing people who have taken a completely anti-anonymity position, which Dyson has not. Dorothy Denning, different story.  I will happily criticize her positions into the ground, because they are what they are.
EFF's position does not exist yet, and the only not completely pro-anonymity individual opinions I've seen out of the board are not anti-anonymity, they're just full of questions. I can't slam people for having questions.

EFF has done none of that either.
Compromise: 1. a settlement in which each side gives up some demands or makes concessions. 2. a) an adjustment of opposing principles, systems, etc., by modifying some aspects of each   b) the result of such an adjustment. 3. something midway between two other things   4. a) exposure,
as of one's reputation, to danger, suspicion, or disrepute   b) a weakening, as of one's principles, ideals, etc.) as for reasons of 1 did not occur. EFF yielded nothing on any of the issues you mention.
On Digital Telephony, which you clearly allude to, EFF opposed implementation of the wiretapping provisions of the CALEA bill from start to finish, and was instrumental in stripping most of them out, replacing them with new privacy protections.  2 did not occur. Our mission remains unedited from the day it was adopted, and EFF is just as committed to those
principles now as ever.  We don't have a system, in the relevant sense, as such.  There was no such adjustment, ergo no result of one.  3 does not apply in any relevant sense (our steadfast assault against the CDA is a "compromise" under such a definition because it was neither a total victory, nor a total loss - yet I'm certain this is not the definition of "compromise" that you intend).  4a is not relevant (that's the security/secrecy-related definition, a nonsequitur in this context).  4b
is simply a restatement of 2a - simply didn't happen.  Our results speak for themselves on this.
I would put forth that the public factors of EFF's efforts are quite public, but that you know nothing of the internal factors of those efforts, and ergo lack sufficient knowledge to make the allegations you make.
I'm at a loss to think of any time in which EFF did otherwise.  I don't think you have any concept whatsoever what a fight EFF put up over Digital Telephony.  I would strongly advise a reading of the original version of the DT/CALEA bill, and the version that passed after EFF took an axe to it. You'll find a world of difference.  You're welcome.
We make no bones about the fact that the DT bill passing at all with wiretap provisions in it was a defeat.  Defeats happen.  Being defeated is not the same thing as bowing, as yielding the fight.
In other words you propose an alternate EFF that censors its own boardmembers.
I'm not aware of any logical consistency that could adhere to an organization that simultaneously says it supports free speech, yet demands that its board of directors never speak except in agreement with the organization's policy.  You are asking for a mini-dictatorship.  EFF has no position on anonymity.  We also have no position on abortion or on whether roast duck is better than fried chicken. You are in essence demanding that EFF impeach any boardmember that offers an opinion in public or in private about whether or not chicken is good stuff, or states
a belief about right to choose v. right to life positions.  I'm sorry that we are not totalitarian enough for you.
Incidentally, Dyson made no such proposal as you refer to, but simply expressed questions and doubts about the misuse of anonymity, and made a clear and correct statement of fact ("you need to be able to get at somebody's identity to enforce accountability") without offering any value judgement about whether that was a good idea. She concluded that "the question is how do you also enforce freedom of speech and freedom from prosecution for unpopular opinions," clearly indicating as much doubt about the value of any attempt to force identifiability and accountability.  Even Dyson's lead statement that "the damage that can be done by anonymity is far bigger" online that offline is factually correct,
and does not consist of any kind of value judgement. It's simply an honest and, IMNERHO, necessary observation.  If we lie to the public, or lie to ourselves, we lose, because the opposition will have arguements we have not even looked at much less wrestled with.
I'm sorry we are not self-delusional and dishonest enough for you.
I have news for you: We are human.  Incidentally, two points: 1) "cohesive political persuasion" is not the be-all and end-all of civil liberties work, just a part of it; and 2) the political cohesion you want to see is very hard to accomplish, because civil libertarians are loath to march in lockstep. Compare the Christian Coalition and their allies -
authoritarians all. It is no surprise, on a moment's consideration, that their spot on the politics-of-rights-and-authority axis has everything to do with their ability to suspend disbelief, to embrace blind faith, and to act in unison.  BUT - a lot of progress is being made.  EFF, ACLU, CDT, VTW, EPIC, et al., are all coordinating like never before, new global-scale civil liberties coalitions are forming, joint legal cases being filed, joint press releases and action alerts, being issued, conferences organized together, etc.  What you are looking for is evolving as we type.
EFF has that. We have not proposed to influence anonymity issues, and we do not have a policy on that issue.  When we have a policy on it, we'll probably propose to influence it.
We have all of these elements, but we have a lot more to do than engage in legislative influence. You've all seen how well that worked.  The process is very corrupt, so we have to use it sparingly, and only when nececessary.  The bulk of our work has to be done in other areas like supporting technical development, fighting cases to the Supreme Court,
direct grassroots action campaigns, public education, media exposure, etc.
All of these things directly affect the Hill, but EFF is not solely a lobbying organization.  Even CDT and other DC-based groups are not solely lobbying organizations.
What's shocking to me is that you'd state as fact "that a given organization does not support [your] interests" when you have no actual knowledge of whether that's true or not, just a vague perception based on clearly insufficient information, and misapprehensions of fact that are easily refutable.
Certainly not. And please note that the person you are responding to does not speak for EFF, so your question is a nonsequitur.
[Some stuff skipped, since irrelevant.]
That says that the board of that organization has yet to come to consensus on the issue.  Happens all the time.  Ask the ACLU - there are all kinds of issues that someone somewhere thinks is "key to its mission" that ACLU has not yet evolved a position on, and won't until they need to due to some event or impending event such as legislation or a court case.
Personally I agree with you that this issue is key to our mission, and I hope that EFF has a position on it soon.  But I'm not the chairman of the board, so I wait, and I speak my mind. I have no problem with you speaking your mind, or even being less willing to wait. But I have no respect for unfounded accusations and fingerpointing. I don't even have much respect for well-founded fingerpointing when it's not helpful.  Cypherpunks are supposed to write code. This is a waste of time. Neither are on our board.  What's your point?
About a thousand. Probably more.
What a laugh. Just an example: At least 12 US state have passed or are considering passing CDA-like state legislation.  Even after we kick the CDA's unconstitutional butt, each one of those state bills, with one or two exceptions if we're lucky, will have to be individually dealt with all the way to the state supreme courts in all probability, and quite possibly to the US Supreme Court in some cases.  None of these bills are direct clones of the CDA, and it's doubtful that a whole lot of the CDA ruling will apply to them, necessitating individual constitutionality challenges.   Now think on how many other jurisdictions there are in the world, from the local to the multinational, and consider how many of them have or are in the process of getting their own CDA-alike.  And this is before we even think about censorship of online "hate speech" or "dangerous information". This is just the anti-porn bills.  AND, when all is said and done the majority of these jurisdictions, especially the US federal Congress, are very likely to come right back and try it all again, with slightly modified bills that attempt to get around previous rulings.   This is complete aside from privacy issues which are even less clear-cut than free speech issues.  If you think there are a handful of issues to wrestle with, you are very, very sadly mistaken. There's an ocean of them.
I must surmise you don't read much about us.
 [EFF has
  a position on intprop in as much as the fair use rights of the public
  are involved, and we work with DFC on this issue.]

See URLs above. Consider it a suggested reading list.
 The list of "cypherpunk" accomplishments in terms
Indeed it is.  I do not think it possible to quantify what EFF have done or what CPs have done, and then weigh the two against eachother. I have yet to see an accomplishometer. I also can't think of any point in doing so. This is not a contest.  We are on the same side.
EFF is not a discussion forum (though we provide, in some sense, a pretty lively one at comp.org.eff.talk in Usenet. We also started alt.politics.datahighway, which sees some traffic, mostly about US govt "info superhighway" hype and b.s.   Comp.org.eff.talk is more general, and tends to focus on civil liberties issues and cases.)
Again, see above. See in particular:
 - PA court rules CDA unconstitutional
 - CA court rules  software - both source and object code - protected expression under the  First Amendment Both cases are headed for the Supreme Court.
NB: I think your criticism is valid at least in the abstract. It is certainly fair to ask what we've done, not how we sound or feel.  I think the refereces I've provided will answer that question adequately.
Then you know absolutely diddley about what we are doing. Beware lecturing about that of which you know little.  If our legal cases win, we win all of the above concerns you just articulated. And both cases look very much like they will win hands down.  And, these are hardly the only fronts we are working on. Notably I have not. Indeed, I mentioned to the board here that the fact that I've met you in person, signed your PGP key, had you and other DC CP's over to EFF's DC office for CP meetings, was a testament to anonymity/pseudonymity - I didn't need to know the name the government calls you buy, just needed to see enough evidence that you as a body are attached to Black Unicorn as a nym, and to have an idea of the reputation of the nym.
[non-relevant (to me) comments skipped.]
I tend to suspect the criticism had more to do with "all talk and no action" and other such concerns. Just my interpretation. The main flaw in this reasoning (which I'm not sure at all is actually Tim's reasoning, but appears to be the reasoning here) is that these efforts are not contradictory, but complementary. As a practical matter, the entire question is meaningless since neither effort can be measured, and there is no point in doing so in the first place, since no issue of whether or not the CPs or the EFF is 'better' has arisen, and no such issue makes sense.
Uh, no, that was someone talking, who has an individual opinion on the subject. One that I don't share and that I don't think anyone else shares at EFF either.  In particular, the litigatory pressures are likely to be groundless, at least in US law. There is a hell of a lot of caselaw supporting the rights to anonymous and pseudonymous speech and publication.
As for the spam problem, that can be rather trivially fixed with filters (or reduced, at least. Clever people will always find a way to break or abuse any given system.)
EFF has never "bailed" from any issue to preserve image.  If we'd been concerned with image, we would not have taken the tactic we did with DigTel - a tactic that worked incompletely but better than shouting "boo" from the sidelines, but a tactic which harmed our image very much. Such is the price we pay. Our mission is not "to look cool to the public", much less to Cypherpunks, our mission is to protect the public interest
and individual liberty.
I have to agree wholeheartedly.
No thanks, we have no use for it.  We also have no use for pointless ankle-biting. Please, go write some code. That's what you guys are best at, and it's why you're here ("here" = cypherpunks).  If you are in need of a project, how about an anon remailer that runs on Windows 3.x, NT, and 95, and another for Mac?  There are what, maybe 20 operational chained remailers right now?  That's not going to cut it. There need to be more. (This is MY PERSONAL opinion, not an EFF statement of policy. For the time being anyway. :)
PS: No hard feelings are held here, on my part, and I intend to convey none, even if I do argue forcefully. I am not your enemy. Consider this a workout, some mental sparring to get the blood flowing.

who is no longer on the board
Democrat v. Republican is largely irrelevant here, though more relevant when you get into infrastructure, universal access, and intellectual property issues - stuff that EFF has touched on here and there, but which is not at the heart of our mission.  There are other democrats on our board and staff, as well as Republicans.  Even Kapor, however, is very strongly for competition, for entrepreneurs, for markets, and ergo differs from a lot of Democrats in that regard. And no one at EFF that I know of is an extreme liberal or conservative on social issues (both extremes are very censorious - the right of "ungodly" things, and the left of "un-p.c." things).  So, again, I'd like to suggest that political party affiliation is approaching meaninglessness. The political axis that counts isn't l. vs. r., but civil libertarian v. authoritarian. No one at EFF is an authoritarian.
That was quite a bit more than a year or two ago. :)
There were no compromise positions. We have 100% opposed implementation of such legislation.  In the case of the Digital Telephony Bill (the later version of S.266, drafted by the FBI), we were simply unable to stop it, and instead had to try to strip as much FBI wish list out of it as possible and insert privacy protections.  That's not a compromise, that's emergency action. We did everything we could.
We are too, for numerous reasons.
Such a position is likely to be the one EFF takes if it takes one, which is probable.  EFF in generally does not issue extremist position statements, but is careful to examine the risks as well as the benefits, and look for pro-liberty solutions to those risks. Just as an aside, in case anyone's interested, what Voltaire actually said was, "I never approved either the errors of his book, or the trivial truths he so vigorously laid down. I have, however, stoutly taken his side
when absurd men have condemned him for these same truths."  The "defend to the death his right to say it" paraphrase is an embellishment. :)

I agree with the general sentiment behind this, but I think it may go a bit overboard. For example, it is worthwhile to support Pro-CODE and SAFE (the two crypto bills now floating around in Congress). On the surface they both appear to threaten the viability of the Bernstein, Karn and Junger cases, but in reality neither of these bills have a chance in hell of passage.  "What's the point then?", you may ask. They slow down the Administration, which is pushing *very* hard and fast to get GAK adopted internationally, and to get US software companies to knuckle in to GAK in exchange for slightly relaxed export controls.  Make a lot of noise about the bills, and you screw up the administration's plans, since they have to divert at least some energy to fending the bills off or they *will* pass.
You do that, but keep the legal staff working solely on the cases, and you have more breathing room to get the cases through the Supreme Court before it's too late. And, in the event you lose the cases, you still have slightly less than a chance in hell of getting one of the bills passed and salvaging *something*, or simultaneously or alternately, just deploying more crypto tech such as S/WAN (which EFF is committed to as of the most recent board meething), since the Adminstration has been slowed down.  The more tech deployment you have, the more irrelevant the Administration's noises are.
The point being: Don't let disgust of a process or thing deter you from milking that process or thing of all it is worth, provided you sacrifice nothing significant in the process.
It has to be a judgement call. On some other issues this tactic does not work. Any legislation about porn on the Net needs to be slammed down, because any such legislation will get gutted by theocrats and turned into a censorship bill, as an example.
Choose action based on careful thinking, not kneejerk reaction, that's my motto, for what it may be worth.

Certainly. EFF regularly compromises with our allies, e.g. on who will run a particular web page, what a campaign icon will look like, where an event will be held, etc.  We're just not in the habit of compromising on legislation, since we are not in a position to give or sell anything, particular the rights of the public and of individual citizens.

Recognition of the right to anything without recognition of the ethics that need to be observed in excerising that right, is an extremist position just as much as is a demand people give up liberty so that "responsibility" can be enforced. It's probably far less dangerous in most cases, but it's still rather indefensible.  That's all.  We certainly do NOT advocate what you may be misinterpreting as our position: that rights should or must be taken away when people behave unethically, or due to the fear that people will behave unethically. That's precisely the opposite of our opinion on everything we have an opinion on.  We hold that liberty must be preserved *in spite of* inevitable abuses.  But we also hold that it's important to know the ethics that come with rights, to adhere to them, to educate other people about them. Otherwise the rights aren't worth much.  What is the value of free speech if every message you receive is a threat, defamation, spam, or private information stolen from someone else? (to give a fairly extreme example).
I believe we are talking about precisely the same position, just in different terms.  Let's not argue. :)

Yes! Exactly! Of course!  Precisely the example that has come up in EFF's own statements on anonymity (which, in absence of a policy on the topic have been strictly factual, reporting both sides of the issue).
That's a common view here, to say the least.  And it's one with which I am in 100% agreement.
We don't either, even those of us with questions and conundrums to think I do think its extremist to not be willing to even address the questions and conundrums, but we're in agrement on that, so not much to argue about,

I grok. Hadn't been on the list for a while, and a lot of lists have set up non-subscriber filters to block spam these days.
I appologize to CP readers, who rightfully question my Ccing the list when I'm not on it (lately, anyway).  I'm just responding to where the message I'm responding to has been.  So far no one's seem particularly upset at this, just irritated, so it seems prudent to continue doing so, unless/until this gets to be a pointless thread.
I've talked to her personally about this.  She's not thinking along those lines, she just perceives a potential problem in the accountability/ethics area, and is wondering how that can be solved, if it can be solved, and what the price of such a solution is.  Honest, she's not *advocating* restrictions on anonymity, just asking if any are necessary, in who's opinion, with what rationale, at what cost, and by what mechanism.
Another CP reader I've been talking to suggests even asking such a question is dangerous because it puts ideas in the minds of anti-freedom legislators.  I tend to disagree on this, since such people already see anonymity as a problem. They come from a world in which every citizen minus a few "weirdos" has an ID card, who's check and credit transactions are traceable, who's money is marked and numbered, whos medical and other records are readily available. And their campaigns are funded by companies with a vested interest in identification (credit bureaus, banks, insurance companies, etc.) The *already have* the idea.   But, that may be neither here nor there.
I would agree when it comes to things that legislators have not even thought about yet. In cases like that, better to work quietly with activists, with industry, etc., to deal with it behind the scenes so it never even appears on congressional or regulatory radars.
Highly unlikely.  Who gets to be a boardmember is decided by a board vote.
Freeh's anti-freedom history, and his obnoxious nature would, in my guesstimate, give him less that a .0000000000001% chance of ever making it onto the EFF board. And that's being nice. :)
Dyson has no such history, and does have a history of careful thought (even if disagreed with by quite a few people) about networks, online commerce, negative effects of regulation, and civil liberties issues.
More the former 3 than the latter 1.  Not everyone on the board is there because of strong work directly in liberty areas, but often for other stuff, as long as they seem consistent with the civil liberties issues. Otherwise we might as well just have one boardmember. The diversity is necessary, as long as it doesn't get divisive.  It has gotten divisive in the past, and there are some boardmembers who are not on the board any more as a result (none that I know of were "canned", they just understood it wasn't working and moved on.)
 > pro-anonymity, and free speech, and later turned out to be having I'll generalize that to "if you had any boardmember who expressed doubts about the value of free speech and privacy, would the board keep them?"
I think not. But Esther's taken no such position. She's asking questions about the mechanics of a system, and the effects of the system on society.  These are valid questions.  It'd be helpful to see some short Cypherpunks-generated answers, if they are available.  Stuff about reputational systems, etc.  I know this stuff in a vague way from reading CP for years, but I don't have or know of any specific documents on the topic.  Something like that to pass around internally here would be of value in helping EFF settle remaining issue, adopt a policy position, and get on with it.
That is unlikely to ever be a concern.  If any boardmember's views proved a liability for EFF mission and work toward that mission, that's when the board would considering asking for a resignation, or kicking someone off the board directly.  We're mindful of PR and image, but the mission comes first. That will never happen.  EFF would tear itself apart in a matter of hours if that happened.  The worst that will happen is that EFF won't adopt a policy on this issue. I tend to doubt that will happen either. As I was telling BU, I think we're closer now than ever before to having an anonymity policy.  That's mainly why I'm asking for pointers to any superb documentation on the topic. It's genuinely needed to resolve a few remaining issues.
Just to be clear: There is no disagreement on the board, or the staff, of EFF that anonymity is a vital component of privacy. If that's what the worry is, lay it to rest!  Actually coming up with a statement on the issue is something that's taking a bit longer due to some concerns and questions that haven't been assessed yet (by the boardmembers with these questions & concerns).
I think that's your inferrence, not her implication. :)  I've talked to her personally about this, and that's not what she's saying.
There's no shortage of candidates in general, but finding ones that add something useful to the mix, get along with everyone, work cooperatively, are not interested in being a board member to add a line to their vitae or for other purely personal reasons, who have enough time and resources to do this, are willing to do fundraising, etc., etc., is somewhat more difficult. (I answer the question since it was asked. I refute, from a personal level, the implication that Esther's not fit to be on the EFF board.
She's been here almost from the very start, and EFF would not be here right now at all if not for her.)
  This long after the fact I have no way of knowing what she said verbatim, in what order, with what stress, etc.  Having been interviewed a lot of times, and seen a mangled result, I know that interviewers often take liberties with the ordering of statements, and remove material, and juxtapose one statment with other stuff it was not referring to originally, etc.  Any of that could have happened. If it was an oral interview, which is likely, keep in mind that many people don't speak well off the tops of their heads.  I can't believe some of the things *I*'ve said in situations like this. They just didn't come out right.
Interviewers often get attribution incorrect too, as in this case.
I think this is a mountain out of a mole hill problem.  Like I say, if EFF comes out with a policy against anonymity, THEN get out the rope.
It just won't happen.  Certainly. All of us do. I know I do.  I still remember the time I slammed the FCC for being "the largest censorship body in the western world", at a time during which EFF was trying to get them to back off from deciding to push for regulatory authority (which, as we've seen, Congress is only too willing to grant).  Needless to say, they would have been less willing to listen to EFF after that, had they seen the comment
(probably didn't, it was in a small local newspaper; had a lot of dangerous potential though.)
Agreed. I'm sure the board agrees too.  We just like, and need, to have answers to the immediate authoritarian attack that will come on what EFF says, before we say it.  The saying about being silent and being thought a fool, vs. speaking up and removing all doubt applies here in an interesting way. If we have unprepared arguments, opponents will make us look like fools. It's only a secondary concern that this hurts EFF's image. The real problem is that things like that undermine the credibility of the whole "cyberliberty" camp.
Any e.t.a. on a Mac one?  Sometimes I wish I could write code worth an exon so I could help move this along. Like I have any time to do programming anyway...     Stanton McCandlish

Rather unlikely, actually. Dyson is far better known, everywhere but the

Who many people outside of the civ-lib crowd know Jane Metcalfe from EFF, vs. from Wired? Even Mitch Kapor is better know as founder of Lotus than of EFF. A lot of press coverage she gets never even mentions EFF at all!

James A. Donald typed:
Faulty logic.  A does not follow from B.  I have news for you: Most nonprofits get most of their funding from businesses.  In some cases, corporations offer funding because the organization exists to represent their corporate donors (such things are variously called industry associations, trade groups, and in some cases PACs.) Others give to organizations that are centered on a written mission statement, rather than on the flexible interests of the donors, and the give because it 1) improves their market or customer base in various ways, and 2) allows them to claim philanthropy and charity, which are marketable traits.
There's a very large difference between organizations that exist to represent the interests of members and donors, whatever those interests happen to be at the moment, and organizations with specific mission statements. It doesn't do well to confuse the two.  It's the difference between the Business Software Alliance and the Free Software Foundation,
between the Telephone Association of America and Voters' Telecom Watch.
This is assumption not fact.  The facts are that EFF accepts donations from companies that support our mission. If they expect to get some kind of trade association style "representation" for that, they are deluded.
What they get is our work to help the Net grow and flourish, which is good for their business. That's the perq they get. Nothing else. If you don't believe this, I invite you to ask all of the RBOCs whether they give us money any more. They used to, but didn't listen and expected us to act like their PAC, particularly on Digital Telephony. Instead of fighting for RBOCs' "rights" we fought for YOURS. They don't fund us any more. We don't care.  Our mission doesn't bend to attract funders. It's stayed the same since day one.  You may think EFF didn't do a good job on DigTel, but we didn't do Bell Atlantic's dance, that's for sure. And why don't you ask our boardmember Tim O'Reilly whether EFF has asked him to stop combatting MicroSoft attempts to license how many IP connections people can make with NT Server, because it hurts our chances of getting money from Bill Gates.
EFF has certainly be *pressured* to behave like a PAC, and this was one of our many reasons for leaving DC. It became increasingly difficult to fund a DC-based organization that was *not* a membership-controlled lobbying organization.  We're betting on one thing: That the software, online commerce, and related industries, centered on Silicon Valley, can be
dragged into the politics that are threatening to stomp them.  It's been observed multiple times by several commentators that some key differences between this industry and older industries are 1) lack of philanthropy - almost no charitable organization support is seen from the computer industry at all, and 2) participation in the political process - there really hasn't been much action of any kind from the computer industry in legislative or legal issues in general, only on specific stuff like their
particular intellectual property rights, even though some of the political issues cropping up on the Hill threaten their entire market.
Most analysis concludes that these two lacking features are due to youth of the industry, and lack of anyone pushing them into action. So, we're pushing. If we fail, we won't be here in 1997.
EFF does not want to be a PAC. We *can't* be a PAC. We don't have the necessary skill set (we have a membership coordinator, we have civil liberties attorneys, etc.  We do not have professional lobbyists, nor do we have an on-staff media and PR communicator, as some examples.)  We'd like to see the industry recognize that what we're doing is vital for them, and to support it, but also to get their own trade associations going and working and actually engaged in the political process (for one thing, that further reduces any desire to try to get EFF to play that role, which we will not do. Less wasted time and effort pushing us, and less of the same from us pushing back.)
I hope this explains the situation fairly clearly.
EFF isn't interested in being "a successful lobby group". That's CDT's job.
You may have missed some of the history here: CDT's core staff is our former policy staff. They split off because they wanted to do lobbying work, and EFF didn't.
That's absurd.  I suppose you think ITAR and the CDA are good things? If not, then our work to defeat them is mutual good.
That's absurd, too.  I suppose there's a hidden grain of logic there: EFF would have little or no reason to exist without some kind of bad action on the part of government when it comes to the Net.  This is true. We all would be really happy if that weren't the case and there was no need for an EFF. The day the government stops censoring and EFF can go away will be the happiest day of my life if it ever happens.  Hell, I could be making 3x my current salary in the commercial sector. If you think I do this because I enjoy working 12 hour days fighting the largest government on earth, for a paycheck that only barely covers the bills, you have another think coming. At any rate, there is no logical connection whatsoever between the grain of truth here, and your conclusion (that EFF must be working to *increase* government control to keep itself alive).  There are many assumptions that one is required to make before arrival at
that conclusion from the data, and some of these conclusions are not only contradictory, but precluded by other observable facts.
In other words you are claiming EFF authored the Communications Decency Act?
In other words, you are claiming EFF is not really behind the Bernstein v. US Dept. of State suit to get rid of the only existing US "legislation that requires case by case approval of software"?

will have on consumers.  Specifically, the team will look at how these
technologies will affect lower-income Americans, and assess standards for
consumer protection.  The task force also will come up with non-regulatory
measures that can be taken to protect consumers while allowing the market to
develop.  "I want to be certain that we make the right decisions as we begin
this new era so that the benefits of these developments are broadly shared
and have a positive impact on our economy," says Rubin.  (Investor's

   DECLARATION OF SHARI STEELE
   County of Charles )
   State of Maryland )
   1. My name is Shari Steele. I am employed as staff counsel for the
   Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nationwide, nonpartisan
   nonprofit civil liberties organization of approximately 3500
   individual members. EFF works in the public interest to protect
   privacy, free expression, and access to public resources and
   information online, as well as to promote responsibility in new media.
   EFF is committed to defending civil liberties in the world of computer
   communications, to developing a sound legal framework for that world,
   and to educating government, journalists, and the general public about
   the legal and social issues raised by this new medium. The facts set
   forth in this declaration are based upon my personal knowledge and
   upon the business records of EFF. I submit this affidavit on behalf of
   EFF.
   2. EFF is a nonprofit organization incorporated under the laws of
   California, with our principal place of business in California. EFF
   has members throughout the United States, including Georgia.
   3. Since our inception in 1990, EFF has devoted considerable resources
   to educating the public about civil liberties and other legal issues
   as they arise in the context of online computer communications, or
   "cyberspace." Throughout EFF's existence, we have initiated and/or
   moderated several online forums, including forums on the World Wide
   Web, the WELL (a California-based conferencing system and Internet
   Service Provider), and USENET discussion groups. These forums are
   primarily interactive discussion groups, but EFF representatives also
   frequently participate in online "chat" rooms and in special online
   events that allow users to discuss and debate a variety of legal and
   constitutional issues.
   4. In addition, EFF has our own computer site on the Internet, and our
   name (sometimes referred to as a "domain" name) is "eff.org." EFF's
   public education efforts include the maintaining of extensive online
   resources, both on the forums we run with online service providers and
   on our own Internet site. These resources include articles, court
   cases, legal papers, news releases, newsletters, and excerpts from
   public discussions related to EFF's legal, legislative, educational
   and advocacy work. EFF also publishes web pages on the World Wide Web,
   which can be accessed at    5. EFF maintains eight online mailing lists, both for specific
   civil-liberties and activist activities, and for informing the public
   about our activities. Our primary mailing list has a subscriber base
   of approximately 7500 individuals, including many located in the State
   of Georgia.
   6. On average, EFF's web page is accessed by Internet users more than
   300,000 times every day. Through our web site, EFF transmits between
   1.2 to 1.5 gigabytes of information per day. Roughly speaking, this
   means that EFF's web site transmits the equivalent of 250 to 350
   million words, or two entire encyclopedias' worth of information, over
   computer networks every day. A substantial volume of this information
   is transmitted into the State of Georgia or through wires located in
   that State.
   7. Although EFF's web site and many of our online resources are based
   on a computer in California, those resources are accessible to EFF
   members and other interested individuals throughout the world and in
   every state of the United States, including the State of Georgia.
   Similarly, the EFF resources and forums that are maintained on other
   national commercial online forums can by accessed by those systems'
   subscribers throughout the United States, including the State of
   Georgia.
   8. EFF routinely advises individuals and groups about their legal
   rights and responsibilities in the online world. In addition, EFF
   advocates positions, and promotes discussions, about what those rights
   and responsibilities should be. Since virtually all interactions on
   the Internet and other computer networks are at their essence
   communication and expression, EFF's policy positions and the
   discussions we foster strongly emphasize freedom-of-speech concerns.
   Similarly, because free flow of information made possible by this new
   online technology creates the possibility of extraordinary intrusion
   into the privacy of computer users, EFF's policy positions and the
   discussions we foster strongly emphasize the issues of protection of
   online privacy, including the right to communicate anonymously over
   computer networks and the right to use encryption software to prevent
   unauthorized interception and viewing of private communications sent
   over computer networks.
   9. As a part of EFF's efforts to protect the privacy of on line users
   and in furtherance of free speech, EFF routinely assists our members
   and members of the general public in protecting their privacy when
   communicating over the Internet, while at the same time emphasizing
   the importance of using these privacy rights responsibly. EFF
   facilitates responsible anonymous communication over computer networks
   in several ways. For example, many participants in online discussions
   and chats sponsored by EFF use "handles," i.e., assumed names, rather
   than their actual names. EFF also provides links on our web page to
   so-called "anonymous remailers," which are computers on the Internet
   that will forward Internet e-mail anonymously, allowing an even
   greater level of privacy for online communications than can be
   obtained by the use of pseudonyms alone. EFF is aware of and
   facilitates the responsible use of online handles or pseudonyms, and
   of communications via anonymous remailers, because the ability to
   communicate over online networks in this way allows users to
   participate in chats or discussions groups without abandoning their
   privacy. It permits users to participate in these discussions without
   revealing their name to strangers, and without fear of retaliation for
   the expression of unpopular or controversial viewpoints. This
   protection of privacy furthers the public interest by facilitating
   freer and more frank discussions, especially on controversial issues
   such as questions of online privacy and encryption software.
   10. Similarly, EFF wants to make the information that we pub lish on
   such issues freely available to computer network users who seek it but
   who want to obtain it anonymously, i.e., by requesting it over
   computer networks using a pseudonym or handle. Again, EFF believes
   that by protecting the privacy of users by allowing them to obtain
   information of public interest anonymously, information on these
   issues can be disseminated more fully and freely over computer
   networks.
   11. In addition, nearly all of EFF's approximately 3500 mem bers use
   online communications. EFF members both receive and transmit
   information through a variety of online communications, including the
   World Wide Web, online mailing lists, discussion groups, chat rooms,
   computer bulletin boards, and private e-mail. Many of EFF's members
   use handles or pseudonyms to protect their privacy when communicating
   over computer networks. Many of these communications pass through the
   State of Georgia.
   12. I have reviewed the language of O.C.G.A. 16-9-93.1, and neither I
   nor EFF can determine from its language whether commu nication over
   computer networks using a pseudonym or assumed name constitutes the
   use of a name that "falsely identifies" the user for the purposes of
   the criminal sanctions imposed by this statute. Because EFF actively
   facilitates and encourages the responsible use of pseudonyms in online
   communications for the protection of privacy, however, and because
   virtually all of the anonymous communications over computer networks
   facilitated by EFF are as easily accessible in Georgia as anywhere
   else in the world, EFF is fearful that our activities could be viewed
   by a Georgia prosecutor as aiding and abetting violations of the
   statute. Similarly, EFF is concerned on behalf of our members that
   those members who communicate over computer networks using pseudonyms
   or handles could be violating this criminal statute. EFF, both on our
   own behalf and on behalf of our members, therefore fears prosecution
   or other enforcement in Georgia under the statute, and seeks guidance
   from the Court as to the effect and scope of this vague law. Although
   EFF is concerned about the risk of prosecution, EFF views any such
   restriction on our activities in furtherance of the public interest as
   patently unconstitutional, and we fully intend to continue our
   activities in support of online privacy and free speech despite the
   passage of this law.
   13. In addition to the many other services that EFF provides to our
   members and to the online community in general is the online
   publication through EFF's web site of an extensive archive of articles
   and other information of interest to the online community. EFF's
   archives include information on government and legislative activities,
   legal issues and cases, academic freedom, censorship, free expression
   and other civil liberties, the infor mation infrastructure and network
   resources, intellectual property, privacy and encryption, net culture
   and the online community, and social responsibility in the use of
   online resources. Included within these archives are hundreds of
   hyperlinks from the EFF web site to other information and resources
   made available by others on the Internet on related topics. Many of
   these links use the trade names of the companies, organizations,
   government agencies or other entities to whom the link is provided. In
   some cases, EFF uses the logos or other graphical symbols of the
   organizations to whom we are linking on our web site. EFF does not
   obtain prior permission from other web publishers before providing
   links to their web sites in this manner. Given the sheer number of
   links, EFF could not as a practical matter do so. EFF does not intend
   to falsely imply that we have obtained such permission or that we are
   formally affiliated with any of these other entities. EFF is aware
   that individuals and companies that maintain their own web sites want
   others to link to their sites as a matter of course. EFF is concerned
   that its use of these trade names and images could violate the Act and
   subject EFF or our members to criminal prosecution, when it is the
   Act, not our actions, that is in defiance of the customary usage and
   spirit of the Internet.
   COMPUTER NETWORKS AFFECTED BY THE RESTRICTIONS OF O.C.G.A. 16- 9-93.1
   The Global Internet
   14. The largest computer network in the world is the Internet. It
   links a large number of smaller networks set up by universities,
   industry, nonprofit organizations, governments, and individuals. While
   estimates can only be approximations due to rapid growth, the Internet
   is believed to connect at least 59,000 computer networks, 2.2 million
   computers, 159 countries, and 40 million users. By some estimates,
   there will be as many as 200 million Internet users by the year 1999.
   15. No one owns the Internet. It is a decentralized global medium of
   communication and expression in which governments, universities,
   institutions, corporations, and millions of ordinary people can
   communicate with each other, express opinions, share ideas, educate
   themselves, and seek, exchange or publish information on every
   imaginable topic either to specific recipients or to the entire world
   almost instantaneously and at minimal cost.
   16. Virtually anyone can now use the Internet to communicate with
   other online users. Anyone with a personal computer, modem, and
   telephone line can obtain access to the Internet through an Internet
   Service Provider ("ISP"), usually for a fee. Many businesses,
   universities, and other institutions have computer networks that are
   directly connected to the Internet and give their employees, faculty,
   students, etc., free or low-cost Internet access accounts. For those
   without a computer or access through work or school, many communities
   have establrnet to communicate with other online users. Anyone with a
   personal computer, modem, and telephone line can obtain access to the
   Internet through an Internet Service Provider ("ISP"), usually for a
   fee. Many businesses, universities, and other institutions have
   computer net works that are directly connected to the Internet and
   give their employees, faculty, students, etc., free or low-cost
   Internet access accounts. For those without a computer or access
   through work or school, many communities have establternet can travel
   any number of different paths to get from its origin to its
   destination. Persons transmitting information over this international
   computer network have no control over the route their messages take.
   Any data transmitted over the Internet could potentially travel
   through the wires or airspace of Georgia.
   18. There are hundreds of thousands of Internet users in the State of
   Georgia, all of whom can communicate with or receive information from
   any other user on the network anywhere in the world.
   Commercial Online Services
   19. In addition to the global Internet, communications over the large
   national computer networks known as "commercial online services,"
   including Prodigy, America Online and CompuServe, are also affected by
   the Act.
   20. These services enable their customers to communicate with other
   customers, access the Internet, and access other proprietary
   information and services available only to subscribers. There are more
   than 12 million subscribers to major commercial online services in the
   United States and overseas; each of these services have customers in
   Georgia, who use the service to communicate with others throughout the
   United States (and in some cases, the world).
   Local Bulletin Board Services ("BBSs")
   21. The Act also affects communications over thousands of local
   dial-in computer services known as Bulletin Board Systems, or "BBSs."
   With a relatively small investment, anyone with a phone line,
   computer, modem, and proper software can establish a BBS to allow
   friends, neighbors, customers, or members of the general public to
   dial in and communicate with each other on topics of common interest.
   There are several hundred such BBSs in Georgia, operated by
   individuals, nonprofit organizations, advocacy groups, and businesses.
   In addition, there are thousands of additional local BBSs in other
   states, which can be reached from Georgia over long distance telephone
   lines or through a network of BBS systems, which allows BBS
   subscribers to communicate with subscribers to other BBSs in Georgia
   and throughout the country.
   THE NATURE OF COMMUNICATION OVER COMPUTER NETWORKS AFFECTED BY THE ACT
   22. Computer users communicate with each other over the com puter
   networks described above in many different ways. The content of all of
   the following types of communications are restricted by the broad
   language of the Act.
   E-Mail
   23. E-mail is the basic method of communication over computer
   networks. It allows one user to send a message to any other user or
   users on the network.
   24. Because mass mailings via e-mail are relatively easy and
   inexpensive, e-mail enables any user to publish and distribute
   information on any topic simply by compiling a mailing list of online
   users and sending the newsletter to everyone.
   Discussion & Chat Groups
   25. One of the most popular forms of communication over com puter
   networks are "discussion groups." Discussion groups allow users of
   computer networks to post messages onto a public computerized bulletin
   board or to an automated electronic mailing list of subscribers, and
   to read and respond to messages posted by others participating in the
   discussion group. Discussion groups have been organized on many
   different computer networks and on virtually every topic imaginable.
   26. On the Internet, the bulletin board discussion groups are known as
   the "USENET" newsgroups and are arranged by subject mat ter. There are
   currently USENET newsgroups on more than 15,000 different subjects,
   and over 100,000 new messages are posted to these groups each day. In
   addition, there are many thousands more Internet discussion groups
   organized through automated mail ing lists to subscribers. There are
   still thousands more organized on the various commercial online
   services and on local BBSs. All or virtually all of these discussion
   groups are accessible by computer users in Georgia.
   27. Similar to discussion groups are "chat groups," which allow users
   to engage in real time conversations with each other by typing
   messages and reading the messages typed by others participating in the
   "chat." Chat groups also occur over the Internet, commercial online
   services, and local BBSs. These groups are often set up by particular
   organizations or online services, but any individual user can form an
   online "chat." Some chat groups are organized for social
   entertainment, and others are organized by a particular sponsor on
   particular topics to provide a specific forum for discussion of issues
   or ideas.
   28. Online discussion and chat groups create an entirely new public
   forum -- analogous to the village green -- in which individuals can
   associate and communicate with others who have common interests and
   can engage in discussion or debate on every imaginable topic.
   Publication and Access to Information: The World Wide Web
   29. A third major category of communication on computer net works
   involves the publication and retrieval of information. Computer
   networks, and especially the Internet, give individuals of ordinary
   means a remarkable new power to publish ideas, opinions, poetry,
   stories, images, video, and sound to the world. This information can
   then be retrieved by anyone in the world who has access to the
   network.
   30. The World Wide Web is the most popular way to publish and retrieve
   information on the Internet. Anyone with access to the Internet and
   proper software can publish "web pages," which may contain text,
   images, sound and even video. The web is comprised of millions of
   separate "web sites" that provide content provided by a particular
   person or organization, and each web site may include one or more
   different web pages published by the author of the site. Any Internet
   user anywhere in the world can view the web pages published by others,
   read their text, look at their images and video, and listen to their
   sounds.
   31. The web was created to serve as the platform for a global, online
   store of knowledge, containing information from a diversity of
   sources, and accessible to Internet users around the world. Though
   information on the web is contained in individual computers, the fact
   that each of these computers is connected to the Internet through web
   protocols allows all of the information to become part of a single
   body of knowledge. It is currently the most advanced information
   system on the Internet.
   The Importance of Links on the World Wide Web:
   32. The web also provides web authors with the unique ability to
   "link" different web pages on the Internet together. These "links" can
   be text or images in a web page that, when selected by the reader,
   automatically transfer the reader to a different location on the
   Internet. For example, a particular link might transport the reader to
   a different part of the same web page or to an entirely different web
   page stored in an entirely different computer anywhere in the world.
   33. The author of any web page can create a "link" that points to any
   other web page published on the Internet, without having to contact
   the creator of the document. In fact, Internet custom and usage does
   not require a web author to contact a document creator, and those who
   create documents expect and hope to have their pages linked to. Many
   of the plaintiffs publish such links in their web pages.
   34. Many pages on the web are published by corporations or
   organizations that operate under trade names. Links to those web pages
   are routinely identified by the trade name of the organization or some
   other logo or trademark that readily identifies the company or
   organization to whose web page the link is directed.
   35. "Search engines" and "directories" on the web are ser vices that
   collect and organize millions of different links to web pages. "Search
   engines," such as Yahoo, Alta Vista, and Webcrawler, allow users to
   search the entire World Wide Web for particular words or phrases. The
   search engine then provides a list of web pages that contain the
   search term and allows the user to "link" to the web page of their
   choice. "Directories" are large databases of web sites arranged
   according to subject matter, similar to an online card catalog.
   Directories provide "links" to relevant web sites on particular
   subjects.
   36. Without these search engines and directories, it would much more
   difficult for Internet users to locate and retrieve information of
   interest on the web. Thus, these search engines and directories
   provide an essential service to all Internet users. They routinely
   provide many "links" to web pages using the trade names or logos of
   the companies or organizations to whom they are linking.
   37. This critical linking feature is the defining character istic of
   the web. The web is comprised of all web pages in the world, stored in
   millions of different computers around the globe. The web is the
   interlocking system of links created by individual users in each
   individual page. Linking is encouraged on the web, because it ties
   different web pages on related topics together into a coherent system,
   even though the individual web pages themselves might be stored in
   different computers in different parts of the world.
   38. "Cyberspace" refers to the combination of all of the online
   communications systems described above.
   WHY PEOPLE COMMUNICATE ANONYMOUSLY IN CYBERSPACE
   39. For many of the same reasons that people have histori cally
   communicated anonymously through other media like print and the
   telephone, online users frequently communicate anonymously or
   pseudonymously in cyberspace.
   40. Anonymity allows online users to voice unpopular ideas without
   fear of retaliation. Citizens can engage in political speech without
   identifying themselves to the party in power. Victims of crime or
   disease can request help and advice without stigma.
   41. Anonymity also eliminates the potential for discrimina tion and
   harassment according to factors like gender and ethnicity. Many women
   communicate online under gender-neutral pseudonyms to avoid harassing
   e-mail. This practice is similar to women who list their telephone
   numbers under their first initials in order to avoid harassing calls.
   Similarly, online users may wish to use a pseudonym in order to avoid
   discrimination or harassment based on names associated with particular
   ethnic groups.
   42. Anonymity also helps online users maintain their privacy. People
   communicating about unpopular or sensitive issues might suffer
   unwanted invasions of privacy, both online and offline, if others had
   access to their real identity. Anonymity also allows famous people to
   communicate online as "average people," without fear of a privacy
   invasion.
   43. In some cases, anonymity is a necessary security measure. The
   personal safety of human rights dissidents, domestic abuse victims,
   and whistle-blowers would be compromised if they could not communicate
   anonymously.
   44. Anonymity also assists users in preventing the collection and
   potential misuse by third parties of personal information about them.
   Online communications can be easily tracked, downloaded and stored by
   anyone; anonymity can prevent unauthorized third parties from tying
   that information to a particular person.
   45. In addition to the advantages of speaking anonymously in
   cyberspace, online users have many reasons for wanting to access
   online information anonymously. Many users would be inhibited from
   accessing controversial, embarrassing, or sensitive information if
   they first had to reveal their identity. Political information, safe
   sex information, and information on stigmatizing diseases are just a
   few examples of content that some users might wish to access
   anonymously. In addition, because most web sites collect information
   about visitors, many online users fear that using their real
   identities would threaten their privacy whenever they access the web.
   HOW INDIVIDUALS COMMUNICATE ANONYMOUSLY IN CYBERSPACE
   46. As a general rule, communications over computer networks typically
   include identifying information, such as the sender's return address
   and message routing information. This default identification of the
   speaker differentiates online communication from communication by
   print and telephone.
   47. Online technology, however, provides users with a variety of ways
   to communicate over computer networks without revealing their
   identity.
   Online Communications Using Pseudonyms or "Screen Names"
   48. Many Internet Service Providers, commercial online ser vices, and
   local BBSs allow users to set up pseudonymous accounts, permitting the
   user to communicate online using a "screen name," "user name," or
   "handle" that is a pen name rather than the real name of the account
   holder. When a user sends mail, publishes newsletters, or participates
   in discussions or chat groups using this screen name, the message sent
   is identified as coming from the screen name adopted by the sender.
   49. Many service providers allow their users to set up multi ple
   "screen names" or "user names." This feature allows users to use
   different names for different purposes. For example, a user might use
   her real name as a "screen name" when communicating by e-mail with
   someone she knows personally, but use a pen name as a "screen name"
   when communicating with strangers.
   50. Pseudonymous accounts allow users to have a consistent identity in
   cyberspace without having to reveal their true identity to the people
   with whom they are communicating.
   Anonymous Internet Access Accounts:
   51. The use of "screen names" alone, however, does not pro vide
   complete anonymity to the user, because the user's service provider
   knows the true identity of the subscriber. To provide additional
   privacy, some Internet Service Providers and local BBS operators offer
   anonymous access accounts. That is, they do not require any
   identification in order to set up an account for communicating over
   the network. These accounts provide additional privacy and security to
   the user because even the service provider has no way to identify the
   true identity of the user.
   Anonymous and Pseudonymous Remailers:
   52. In addition to the use of screen names or anonymous ac cess
   accounts, there are special services that allow online users who
   normally communicate online under their real names to send particular
   messages anonymously or pseudonymously over the Internet. These
   services are known as pseudonymous and anonymous remailers, and they
   consist of software programs that run on computers connected to the
   Internet. When an online user sends e-mail to the remailer address,
   the remailer strips the identifying information from the message and
   then forwards the mail to its destination. The recipient receives mail
   that has no evi dence indicating its point of origin. Remailers can be
   used to send individual e-mail and to post messages to mailing lists
   or USENET newsgroups.
   53. "Pseudonymous remailers" are remailers that set up ac counts for
   repeated use. The operator of a pseudonymous remailer knows the
   account holder's real e-mail address but provides the account holder
   with a secret numeric identifier that is used whenever the account
   holder sends a message through the remailer. Other anonymous users,
   each with their own secret numeric identifier, can then reply to the
   anonymous message. This allows users to create a double-blind
   situation where two or more users can have an ongoing exchange without
   ever knowing the identity of the other users.
   54. Anonymous remailers do not require setting up any account with the
   service. Any Internet user can use these services by sending an e-mail
   message to the remailer, which will forward it anonymously to its
   final destination.
   55. Currently, there are over 20 public remailers that any online user
   may use free of charge.
   56. To prevent abuse of such remailers, there are programs available
   to the public, known as "kill files" and "bozo filters," that provide
   online users with the means to screen out anonymous messages if they
   desire. These programs reduce the likelihood of harm from misuse of
   anonymous remailers.
   Online Publishing Under Pseudonyms or Anonymously
   57. As in the case of e-mail, many publishers in the online medium
   choose to do so using pen names.
   58. For additional anonymity, some Internet Service Providers also
   allow persons and organizations to set up and maintain web pages
   anonymously.
   Anonymous Access Services:
   59. Conversely, many online users seek to receive information
   anonymously over the Internet. As a general rule, however, obtaining
   information anonymously over the Internet is difficult because every
   time an online user visits a web site, she leaves a digital "calling
   card" that reveals the address of the computer from which she is
   linked to the Internet, the address of the web site she last visited,
   the kind of computer she is using, and other details. Most web sites
   keep logs with this information on all of the visitors that access
   their sites.
   60. Many online users fear that their privacy will be invaded if data
   collected by web sites is misused, particularly where the user has no
   knowledge of the amount of data being collected by various web site
   operators.
   61. To assist online users in protecting their privacy, there are now
   services that allow online users to access information anonymously on
   the Internet. These services, called "anonymizers," serve as middlemen
   between the user and the par ticular pages he wants to retrieve. An
   anonymizer strips all references to the user's e-mail address,
   computer type, and previous page visited before downloading the web
   page to the user. If the user follows a link from a page accessed
   through the anonymizer, the linked page is also accessed anonymously.
   I, Shari Steele, declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing
   is true and correct.
