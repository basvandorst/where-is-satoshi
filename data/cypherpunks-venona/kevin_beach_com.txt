@_subject: Traceless Calling 
For anyone interested in private communications:
We have a way to make untraceable phone, fax and modem calls!
We've negotiated with a reseller to pre-pay a (huge)chunk of minutes at a set
price. No information is taken. My company simply gives them the money and
they give us an 800 number and a ton of random access codes to get into their
network...from anywhere in the world(it can also be used as a travel card). We
then make the number and codes available with no record of ownership. As well,
by the time we distribute the access codes, they have been sequestered through
3 levels of distribution.
Payment is made up front in cash or by money order and no record is kept of
who gets which access code. No records, no invoicing, no auditing by Uncle
Sam. Just complete communications privacy.
Access codes are available in blocks of 100 minutes for $75. Volume discounts
are available. FYI, another company is providing this same service at 90
minutes for $99.
