I have often thought that in spite of the raw numbers of commercial
Windows platform, the freely redistributable distributed computation
harnesses often end up doing much "more" of the computation.  If this is
the case, it would seem that some sort of Java VM system--such as that
which exists in all Netscape 3.0 with JRI--would be the more natural "target" for development efforts.  The recent licensing agreements from
JavaSoft for JDK source make me nervous about the use of Java though.
Can anybody point to a source which details Hardware/Software
combinations used in distributed cracks?  Maybe I can put some numbers
