@_subject: REF ... GCHQ 
Ref the GCHQ question,
I have posted to this group previously, ie yesterday, details on GCHQ,
and I wish to take issue with
Original Question >>>What does GCHQ stand for, and what does it do? Is it similar to the NSA?
Duncan replied
THIS IS WRONG .....
GCHQ stands for the Government Communications HeadQuarters. They are part of
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. They have NOTHING to do with the
Ministry of Defence.
The Royal Signals Establishment, when it existed, it closed in about 1970
was located at Christchurch. It amalgamated with the Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern to form the Royal Signals & Radar Establishment
(RSRE) with the prime site being at Malvern.
They were once more reformed 2 years ago to become the Defence Research
Agency, which includes the prime non-nuclear research establishments in the
UK. FYI these are RSRE at Malvern, at Fort Halstead the Royal Armaments Research & Develeopment Establishment, at Farnborough the Royal Aircraft Establishment and at Portland, the Admiralty Research Establishment
(They upset the monarchy about the turn of the century and as a result have never received the Royal Charter)
Let me say again that GCHQ or it's groups have nothing at all to do
with the MoD and that the Royal Signals Establishment (or even the Royal
Signals & Radar Establishment) are not located at Cheltenham and are
not associated with GCHQ!!!!

@_subject: Ref Strong Encryption 
am I missing something ....
How can the case be made for strong encryption, based upon the worries
of people over viruses???
I fail to see how the worries over viruses can be countered, channelled into the need for strong encryption. ???
