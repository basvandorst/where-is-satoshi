Knowing who is pulling Verisign's strings, I sincerely doubt that
a thinly-veiled character assassination of Phil Zimmermann is out
of line with their corporate policy.
It's a little early to start cumming in your pants over PGP's loss
of reputation capital, P[s]hill.
When the dust is finished settling in the battle deciding whether we
will live in a total surveillance state, or not, Verisign is likely to
end up at the bottom of the dust-bin (unless, of course, you accomplish
your aims at the company very, very quickly--which is highly unlikely).
