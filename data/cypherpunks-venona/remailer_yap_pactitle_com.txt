    Coman said [police] officers can use "CDLISCheck" to access commercial
    driver license status, history and AKA information. She noted that
    the new service was developed in response to a Congressional mandate
    that requires access to commercial carrier and driver information by
    at least 100 roadside sites by 1996 and at least 200 locations by 1997.
There's a congressional mandate for nationwide online id???

Mailcrypt support for type 2 remailers doesn't really work very well.
You can't specify more than one recipient.  You can't post to a
newsgroup with the "post: news.group" destination.  And somehow not
all the right headers end up making it into the next message.
A better emacs interface to mixmaster remailers is definitely needed.

Where do I get PGPlib?  An Altavista search of PGPlib turned up
nothing, and it's not on net-dist.mit.edu, which I thought was the
canonical distribution point?

Can someone explain what, if any, effect this might have on domestic
use of encryption?  When they say relaxing export restrictions in
exchange for escrow, that still just means escrow for exportable
products (which they are hoping will be almost everything), right?
Is there any danger of domestic encryption without escrow being

What do you mean very interesting?  It was a total let down.  It
counted down for ten minutes and then that was it.  I was hoping to
get syn-bomed or bombarded with IP fragments or something.
Very disappointing.

Sorry, but the government generates all keys.  Otherwise people might
mess up and choose insecure keys.

Have you heard any reports of anyone successfully downloading it
period?  Netscape always times out in the middle of a download.  I
think the server is so overloaded that it's actually impossible to
download the software.
I sure wish there were an ftp site overseas somewhere, then I could
actually get the damned thing.

Sorry, RC4 only works in OFB mode.  It is not a block cypher.
