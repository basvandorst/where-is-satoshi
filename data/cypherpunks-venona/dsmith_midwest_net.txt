It's a nice idea, really.  The problem is - how do you verify the
absolute time?  For instance, by resetting a PC's internal clock
you can instantly circumvent that measure.  Possibly by forcing
the application to consult a "reliable" clock like one of the
cesium clocks, but that could be hacked.
   Unless you can absolutely, reliably, and without fear/danger of
being hacked around, verify the correct time, self-destruct crypto
probably won't happen.

@_subject: [NOISE] Review: GoldenEye 
Just got back from the new Pierce-Brosnan-as-007 flick.
It had a few typical "hacker" stereotypes, and a couple
of interesting crypto relevant references.
* Boris, the stereotypical hacker, was hacking through American
banks.  A screen had the words "Department of Justice" and the
DoJ logo; underneath were the words "Clipper Chip" and a list
of banks.
* The archvillian's plan involved a massive money transfer and
an EMP pulse; he very briefly explained the effects of what
would happen if every computer in London were rendered non-
functional.  Possible crypto-anarchy bits.
* Boris should learn the value of strong passphrases.  His
password for the massive mainframe which will be used in the
archvillain's scheme is a five-letter dictionary word, which
didn't change (and it was used on two different computers),
and he revealed it indirectly (it was a word puzzle).
* A few on-computer-screen references to "encryption".
* Boris and the mastermind kept bantering about "breaking codes."
* Boris' computer in Russia - in his apartment - has a domain
ending in ".comp.math.edu"; when his screen lights up with
the words "INCOMING EMAIL" he goes into a live chat (complete
with graphics).
Above-average action/adventure flick.  The technical mistakes are
forgiveable in the interest of dramatic license.  Don't watch
it for the techno/crypto bits, though.  Watch it because lots
of things blow up :)

Does it necessarily matter whether the random delay time is true-random?
The idea is to obfuscate the time of the whole computation.  As long
as you don't base your random numbers on the system clock, it should
serve its purpose.  (I omit the system clock because timing seems to be
the nexus of the whole attack, so we can safely assume that the clock's

That's more of what I was looking for.  I suppose that (I'm still using

myself, where only the two of us know the passphrase, with a keyid of
"David Smith  on behalf of Helen Jones "
or something similar.  The obvious problem is that in sharing the pass
phrase the security is weakened.  (Paranoid threat model: at some point
we have to decide on the pass phrase, and we are videotaped/bugged/spied

Firstly - and don't take this personally - how much computer
knowledge do you have?  The PGP sources use all sorts of
 and other kludges.  A fair amount of C coding
ability is needed to get the damn things to do much of
anything.  (Hell, I can't read most of it - my precompiled
MSDOS version does what I need it to do.)
If you make PGP more user friendly... well, PGP 3.0 is still
coming Real Soon Now (TM) and it will include an API that
will make hooking into it ridiculously simple.  Beyond that,
there are already a number of good DOS and Windows shells
for it, and nobody on unix-flavoured systems expects a clean
user interface anyway :)  (Well, except for XWindows...)
But, if you write it - and I'm cautioning you to be sure
you don't reinvent the wheel - you can distribute it freely.
I suggest using the terms of the GNU GPL.
And the key values - well, you can give it 32k bits, but 1.
generating a key pair could take a prohibitively long time;
2. nobody else can use it (the default PGP distributions
are capped off at 2047 bits).
Good luck.

 eliminates dead email and inactive ftp, www and gopher sites, allows for
 a better-working and faster Internet.
 This year, the cleaning process will take place from 12:01 a.m. GMT on
 Feb. 29 until 12:01 a.m. GMT on March 1.  During that 24-hour period,
 five powerful Internet-crawling robots situated around the world will
 search the Internet and delete any data that they find.
 In order to protect your valuable data from deletion we ask that you do
 the following:
 1.  Disconnect all terminals and local area networks from their Internet
 connections.
 2.  Shut down all Internet servers, or disconnect them from the Internet.
 3.  Disconnect all disks and hardrives from any connections to the
 Internet.
 4.  Refrain from connecting any computer to the Internet in any way.
 We understand the inconvenience that this may cause some Internet users,
 and we apologize.  However, we are certain that any inconveniences will
 be more than made up for by the increased speed and efficiency of the

Unless Alice will automatically rotate between some random set
of Bob1, Bob2, Bob3... It also wouldn't be too difficult
to set up a message that goes through several points before
emerging at a randomly-chosen exitpoint, including a
completely independent remailer.
Actually, there's an Idea.  Set up a single address; use added
headers in the style of:
Remailers-To-Chain: 7
Remailers-To-Avoid: remailer
Final-Destination: tcmay
Each remailer could construct a message that decrements the
remailers counter, preserving the other headers.  The
usual caveat on encrypting at each step would apply; but since
remailers' pubkeys are available, that's a trivial concern.
A lot more could be done with this general concept.  One immediate
problem is that the frontend address is a target, even though
it can't be obviously connected to any objectionable messages.
Packet sniffing is always a concern, etc etc...
Flame away.

Well, I freely admit that it was just a notion that sort of came
to me whilst at the terminal, with a beer on the desk.  The sort
of thing that often impairs my already-limited judgment :)
Although... is this a possible way to lessen remailer-operator
liability?  If it is known that every remailer along the
way chooses another remailer at random, it might become
less likely to hold any given last-hop remailer liable
for the CO$ documents spewed forth from it.  It would
become necessary to keep track of the final destination and
to decrypt at every stage, unless there's a set Last-Hop:
header; but that would defeat the whole purpose.  Having
traffic going all over the place randomly might be useful
to defeat traffic analysis, though.
I think I've just argued myself out of the whole idea.
Never mind :)
