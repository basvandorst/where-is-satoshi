Can the same sort of standards as per the U.S. CDA be applied? The first
draft of the
CDA would have held ISP's responsible for, e.g., porn transmitted using their services. Isn't this the same sort of thing - that is, that remailer
operators provide
a service, and they cannot be held responsible for people who abuse that
service? I
think that this line of thought is reasonable.

I believe I understand the basic concepts of AP - perhaps not the far-reaching
implications, but the fundamentals. I've thought about it, and I am against this
system. What will happen when you've killed off all of the politicians/gov't
who haven't quit? Do you really think this will make things better? Anarchy
won't work with people. Have you ever read Lord of the Flies? I'm sure some
haven't. I will explain my reasoning.
In Lord of the Flies (a novel by William Golding) a group of British
schoolboys are
deposited on a desert island. They have been evacuated from England because
of a nuclear war. There are no adults. A responsible few try to maintain the
rules and
order of society to which they all are accustomed, but they are symbolically
out of power when the anarchists of the group break away and form their own
To make a long story short, they revert to animal sacrifice, and human
before the story closes. Very unsettling, no? The defects of society can be
back to the defects in the individual. A direct quote from the author, who
is not
infallible, or even a reputable authority on the flaws and merits of
humanity, but
still, who is to say that once our notably corrupt governments are gone, the

They had to come from somewhere - the public, obviously. Have any of you AP
considered that perhaps our oh-so-corrupt government officials are simply
the best that our amoral, decaying populace has to offer? What would we gain by
rubbing them
The point I make is that in elected governments (and I realize, not all are
so lucky)
the elected people are, most likely, the best of what the public has to
offer. Who
can blame them for being corrupt? Doesn't all power corrupt? I believe so. Maybe
the current form of government isn't perfect, or even great, but it is still
better than anything that could possibly result from anonymous terrorism,
which is
really what AP is, isn't it? Peace can only be achieved by understanding,
not through
force or fear.
Oops. Well. It's too late now... :-)

Once your secret key has been compromised, then all that prevents a Bad Guy

aside from grabbing keystrokes a la TEMPEST, the only way to get this passphrase
is by brute-forcing it, or maybe searching your house for the little piece

to compute the security of your passphrase and also passphrase generators - I don't know if either are any good, though.

@_subject: hacked version of PGP - win95 long filenames 
I suffer from the great misfortune of a dos computer, and despite my
anti-micro$oft efforts, I still am stuck, most of the time, with Windows
95. This OS assigns long filenames (the sensible kind, that is) to the
old-style eight-character and three-character separated by a dot. However,
they did it in such a way that old filenames still work. So if I have a file I want to encrypt, PGP will mess up this system.
oldname.txt -> oldname.asc
This is the normal way PGP would encrypt. However, f I have assigned the oldname.txt file a new file name under the win95 system, it will look
something like this.
"Old File" (oldfil~1.txt)
This conforms with the new scheme. If I PGP encrypt, this happens:
oldfil~1.txt -> oldfil~1.asc
Thus, the new filename is lost, both for the ciphered file, and for
the file once I decrypt. Is there a way (aside from not using long
filenames) such as a hacked version of PGP that has a workaround for
this problem? Also, is this an issue on the list of improvements for
future official versions of PGP?

@_subject: Re: Remailer Operator Liability? 
This is the problem I have with the whole issue. Obviously, since nyms
use reply blocks, the remailer operators that are inside the reply block
have no control over what is sent (PGP-encrypted) through their remailer.
If I was to go out into the city, and tack up some porno on a building,
maybe something where kids walk by, then someone would take it down, most
likely, but there would be no tracing it to me, because I would be already
long gone from the building. We should make the best efforts we can to
make remailers fully anonymous. My ideas are more that accept PGP, and
(has this already been suggested and/or rejected?) automatic chaining.
That is, remailer  could automatically encrypt and send to   ...
 before going on to its destination. The number of added remailers and
which were used could be made random. (ie, have a list of remailers and
pick from it each time...) Would this work?

Since HTML uses the < and > (less-than and greater-than) characters in
