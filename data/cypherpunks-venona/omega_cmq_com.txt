Family.  Friends.
What basic services are you referring to?
The money won't be "floating around," it will be in the pockets of
individuals instead of being paid out as taxes.
You should do more examining of Libertarian resources on the net.  And
do some thinking on your own.  Start with the presumption that
individuals and private organizations can operate more efficiently than
the government.

No.  Cypherpunks *expect* it will be outlawed.  And it will be yet
another largely uneforceable restriction.
Sure you can run around and trumpet about how bad it is that your
government is going to outlaw cryptography.  You can rant at the
fundamental unconstitutionality of it.  You can try to convince
legislators who don't even know what a mouse is that outlawing crypto
is a bad idea.
If it makes you feel good and you think its a valuable effort, knock
yourself out.
Personally, I'd like to see more disposable remailers, more
stego,continued development of the eternity server and similar ideas,
and an implementation of untraceable anonymous digital cash.  (We have until Jan. 1, 1999)
Phil Z. didn't release PGP to show how much he disliked Clipper or
join in some unified opposition.  He released it to beat the
government's efforts to the punch and get unrestricted strong crypto
into the hands of anyone who wanted it

"distributing"  Does that include paper copies of source code?  How
about slowly and carefully reciting source code to an audience? Writing it on a blackboard, perhaps?
What if I respond to Adam Back and accidently forget to snip his .sig? (if that's not prior restraint, I don't know what is!)
This, of course, is what remailers are for.  More prior restraint, of
course.  Who's being saved?
Fuck 'em.

And the longer the wait the better.  Some have complained that the
status quo situation of export restrictions was unacceptable.  Yet
the spread of crypto has largely been unrestrained -- a stay of
execution so to speak.  The longer the status quo remains, the more
ubiquitous crypto becomes and future legislative efforts are
That said, I think these organizations made a strategic error.  Had a
draconian bill been introduced first, opposition probably would have
played out differently in the press.  We saw this with Clipper.
I believe commercial interests played a large part in the push for
Just another player in the game, I suppose.
You almost sound surprised.  Did they really think Congressman would
understand crypto?  Congressmen _do_ understand law and order and
protecting poor defenseless children from porn.  They understand
preventing "another Oklahoma.   And it's an easy sell to their
constituencies, too.
The average schmoe may indeed *want* more freedom, but he also he wants
to be protected.  And he also has a limited understanding of the
equation.  The easiest explanation wins, of course.
Some people just don't get it.  You'll never gain more freedom through
more legislation.

Sort of like TCFS (Transparent Crytpographic File System) for Linux? Is there such a thing for Windows?  NT?  Mac?
If so I've heard of none.
