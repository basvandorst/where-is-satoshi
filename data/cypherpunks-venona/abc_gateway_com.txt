And to add to the exchange, I'm offering a US$50 [real] discount for any
client of Gateway Communications that deposits $5 [cyber] via my web page. The reduction hurts me very little, and the exchange of cyberbucks is fun. Isn't that why we do this stuff anyway?       It's time to stand and cry             |  Alan B Clegg

@_subject: Digest [full] version available 
I have setup an un-moderated digest of the Cypherpunks mailing list and it
is now available for everyone..
My main goal on Cypherpunks is to lurk and the digest version lets me do
that without being forced to read each one as it comes in.. [or filter the posts into a mailbox that I have a bad tendancy to leave for long periods of time...]
Digests will be created every 40K bytes.

@_subject: While browsing the IRS ("Electronic Certification") 
While poking around at  I found the following:
The first paragraph reads:
The Financial Management Service is implementing an Electronic
Certification System to permit fast, secure, and accurate transmission and
certification of payment data. The system has been approved by the General
Accounting Office for satisfying the signature certification requirements
of 31 U.S.C. 3325 and 3528. Would anyone like to comment on what is being used to provide signatures?  Reading on down a bit, we get to this:
It uses a microcomputer to generate voucher schedules,
electronically certify the vouchers, and transmit them via a dial-up
telephone line to a mainframe host computer at the servicing Regional
Financial Center. The electronic certification process provides positive identification of
the certifying officer who authorizes the voucher for payment and ensures
the authenticity of the transmitted data. It also detects any deliberate or inadvertent manipulation, modification,
and loss of data between the time the voucher is certified in the Federal
Program Agency microcomputer and the time it is verified at the servicing
Regional Financial Center host computer.

@_subject: Mailing lists down for 48hrs, now coming back up. 
The bsdi-isps, bsdi-users, bsdi-users-d, xconq, humor, cheapnet, and
cypherpunks-d mailing lists have been down since Saturday night at about
8:00pm Eastern. The systems handling these mailing lists are now trying to get out from under the load, and normal operation should resume within 24 hours (I hope).
(The primary mail machine for gateway.com is currently running at a load average of 19.8 and still puffing)

@_subject: Mailing lists moving site!  (list outages may occur) 
The physical and network location of the machine doing mail service for gateway.com will be moving some time around March 31/April 1.  Hopefully, service will not be interrupted for more than about 3-4 hours, but I can't promise anything (the system will be moving to my side of an ISDN circuit instead of living on-site with one of my clients).
This move will affect the following mailing lists:
There may also be an impact on other lists as routing for the gateway.com domain is moved from its current 192.x.x.x network to a CIDR block under another provider.  The other lists involved will be:
Sorry about this, but over-all, service will be better after the move (I will once again, be the master of my network's destiny [or something like                                       \             Alan B. Clegg

@_subject: machine moved, mailing lists intact. 
Update:  cypherpunks-d, bsdi-users(-d), unix-lizards.
The system running the mailing lists has now been physically moved from
one place to another (phew, didn't drop it!), and all seems to be OK.  A
couple of DNS changes still remain to be made, but things seem to be
working pretty well. I will be moving a couple of things around and updating some systems OS soon, so we're not all done yet... Please let me know if you see any additional oddities.  Just for the record: ISDN really IS cool.  I just can't wait to get that other B channel running.. yowza.. 128k to the house!

There are 40 million 'attack capable' systems connected to the Internet and over 120 countries have developed or are developing 'attack software'.
[BTW, there will be a BUNCH more attacking systems when 'a new protocol is deployed because they are running out of addresses']
