What would happen if I flew out of the US with a portable
computer that has crypto software (like PGP) installed ?
Assuming that I had no intention of distributing the software
abroad, would I be violating some US export law ?
Matt Blaze (?) had written about his humorous experience
in trying to do the right thing.  It seems that the US Govt.
does not seriously enforce its own export policies.  But
they may start doing so any time.  I am sure that today many
people regularly fly into Europe with crypto software,
without intending to break any laws.
At one point, I had heard that some sort of exception was
planned for export of crypto for personal use.  Does anyone
know if this is real or just a rumor ?

So, refuse to buy their money.
Demand open systems.
If you feel like being more terroristic, get Markoff to write an article
on how a cypherpunk expert feels that the Mark Twain Bankshares system
'may' be insecure.

Yes.  But...
I deal with the security infrastructure for a large corporation.
I want only security administrators to configure the list of acceptable CAs.
I specifically do not want our users to be able to add new CAs
to the list of trusted "approved" CAs.
The concern is that some users who are not crypto enthusiasts may be
"social engineered" into adding a very liberal CA to their list.
Once this happens, the browser's signature verification capability
is totally compromised.
This is one of the reasons why PGP has not been adopted by many large
companies.  In response, Viacrypt now seems to have a product that
can restrict user modifications to the public keyring.
