    Much better, look at rfc822.  (I wouldn't consider *anything* that
has the word "sendmail" in it a good reference).
    Hostnames will match the regexp [-A-Za-z0-9.]; those are the only
legal characters in the hostname portion.  Usernames
("domain-dependent local string") are much harder to what is and isn't
legal.  Read rfc822.

    Umm, no.  I work for the Foundation in my copious free time.  This
has never happened.  And I just asked Richard about it to be sure.  He
was amused.
    It would be *very* difficult to pass this by anyone.  People at
FSF diff the source code a lot, and we're far from the only ones.
