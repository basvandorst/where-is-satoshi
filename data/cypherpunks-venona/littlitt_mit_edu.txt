Check out SMART, which was originally developed by Gerard Salton at
Cornell. (He is one of the pioneers of IR.) The current release is
maintained by Chris Buckley (chrisb Check out:
If you don't feel like installing the whole thing but are interested
in testing it out on some spam, then I could run some tests for you.
Here are some literary references for SMART:

You are thinking of the article in Scientific American about the
Vision and Modeling group at the MIT Media Lab. For face recognition
stuff, check out:
Crypto and privacy relevance? Lots, I imagine.

@_subject: USPS electronic postmark 
Today I was at the Internet Expo in Boston and I sent myself a
postmarked email from the USPS booth. It is enclosed below for all to
Here is an excerpt from the literature they had:
  "The United States Postal Service has entered into a limited market
  test phase for the Electronic Postmark, Archival, and Authentication
  Services. This is a fee for service test.
  The Electronic Postmark applies a time and date stamp to an electronic
  document, hashes it, and digitally signs the document with a Postal
  Service private key.
  ...
  The Electronic Postmark Processor time and date stamps the message,
  hashes it using the SHA hashing algorithm and digitally signs this
  with the Postal Service DSA 1024-bit private key. For the market trial
  we will use CCITT X.500 Section X.509 V3 certificate public/private
  key technology with the federal standard Digital Signature Algorithm."
I will also paraphrase something that was said by one of the people at
the booth:
  "We always send the message itself as an attachment. The message that
  you see at first shows the postmark, and warns you not to open the
  attachment if you are not the intended recipient. Just as with normal
  mail, it is a federal crime to double click on the attachment to view
  the contents of the message if the message is not for you."
Further BS of this nature can be found at:
My favorite line from that web page is:
  Postal ECS plans on regularly changing the Postal Service private key
  as recommended by cryptography experts, which will only require the
  redistribution of the VERIFY.DLL file to Mail Reader users.
Wow, it _only_ requires distributing a new public key to all users!
As stated above, here is the message in its entirety, exactly as it
arrived in my mailbox. Below that is the base64 decoded for your
