@_subject: New Paper: Covert Channels in the TCP/IP Protocol Suite 
I have released a new paper entitled: Covert Channels in the TCP/IP Protocol Suite
This paper demonstrates several methods of encoding secret data into the
headers of the TCP/IP protocol. Main topics of interest include:
- Encoding data into IP headers.
- Encoding data into TCP headers.
Specific areas of focus allow encoding of data into the IP
identification fields and TCP sequence number fields for clandestine
transmission of data to a remote host. Packets of data appear normal to
network sniffers and packet filters, yet can contain hidden messages in
either plaintext or ciphertext.
Other methods revealed include a new technique where forged packets can
be "bounced" off any Internet connected site to establish a
communication path that appears to originate from the "bounced" host. Additionally, several methods are discussed regarding bypassing of
packet filters with encoded data for communication with hosts inside a
protected network.
This paper contains actual demonstrations as well as source code for
Linux 2.x systems to allow encoded transmissions between sites to be
