@_subject: ip: Freeh: Kiddie Porn was Encrypted (fwd) 
In an address at the International Cryptography Institute
conference in Washington today, FBI Director Louis Freeh
revealed that the Bureau encountered encrypted material during
the course of its "Innocent Images" investigation.  That
operation recently led to dozens of nationwide arrests for
alleged trafficking in child pornography via America Online.
Freeh also disclosed that encrypted files were found during the
course of a terrorism investigation in the Philippines involving
an alleged plot to bomb a U.S. airliner and assassinate Pope
John Paul II.
The FBI Director characterized encryption as a "public safety"
issue and stated that the FBI and law enforcement agencies
around the world "will not tolerate" a situation in which the
wide availability of encryption may impede those agencies'
"public safety functions."  While noting that the current U.S.
government policy is to encourage the "voluntary" adoption of
key-escrowed encryption techniques, Freeh raised the specter of
a mandated "solution."  Freeh stressed that the FBI "prefers" a
"voluntary approach," but likened the encryption issue to last
year's Digital Telephony debate, where the FBI first attempted
to achieve voluntary compliance but eventually sought and
obtained a legislative mandate to assure law enforcement access
to digital communications.  Freeh indicated that "if consensus
is impossible" on the encryption issue, the FBI "may consider
other approaches."
Following his prepared address, Freeh was asked why the FBI
needs key-escrow when it has apparently been successful in
decrypting information encountered in the cited investigations.
His response to this question was somewhat vague, leaving
unanswered the question of whether or not the Bureau was, in
fact, able to decrypt the encrypted files seized in the
"Innocent Images" investigation.  More information on this
point is likely to emerge as these cases come to trial.

@_subject: Timing Attacks 
I'm not so sure I see the great usefulness of this attack.
I've taken a cursory glance at Mr. Kocher's paper on-line and what it comes down to essentially, if I undestand it correctly, is that you need to be as sure of the timing as you can be.
Now, on a distributed system, you can't measure those timings, because any latency  could come from the originating computer, the links in the middle or any combination of them.
Also precise timings can be limited by fluctuating load averages amongst other things in a time-sharing computing environment.  While this might work in a lab, with the current advances in computing speed, the differences between a fast and a slow calculation can easily be opaqued by network lag.
Am I missing something, or does this attack only work in a lab?

@_subject: Re: Timing Attacks 
It appears to be more practical than 99 percent of the "weaknesses"
that get published.  Not bad, I'd say.  It's also a very cute attack;
I'd never have guessed a priori that you could get that many key bits
from timing data.
"Random delays added to the processing time may increase the number of
ciphertexts required, but do not completely solve the problem since
attackers can compensate for the delay by collecting more
measurements.  (If enough random noise is added, the attack can
become infeasible.)"  [extended abstract, p. 5]
Sufficient network noise *might* make the problem go away, in some
cases, but that's a weak sort of claim to make about a cryptosystem.
(What if the attacker tries at six in the morning, or cracks a machine
local to you, or just gets lucky?)  You might put your server behind a
time-quantizing firewall...
Also, it's not just networked machines.  Smart cards may have a hard
time defending themselves against hostile card readers.  They're slow
already; the user may not appreciate the extra time spent for
obfuscation.  (This depends critically on the numbers, of course.)

And those theoreticians sit behind their desks and keep scribbling on their pads.  There's not much going on the ground with theory.  Plus, if you knew anything about theory, a lot of theory has very little immediate practical importance...complexity theory is good to make sure that one-way functions actually do exist, but in progress, there's not much way to implement it.

Release time.
And I guess I finally get to add my name to the roles of Cpunks that 'write code'.  I finished a release of a simple Zero Knowledge Authentication system that uses the GNU Multiprecision Library to implement a modified Fiat-Feige-Shamir ZKIPS.  It is written in C on FreeBSD 2.1-R but should run on anything that uses BSD socket code.  I tried to write it fairly It is a very early release with little bounds checking or any of the hardening that would be required in a secure environment--hell in a secured environment, you'd want to write the bignum package yourself.  But in any case, its just to get some practice writing this sort of code as well as amuse myself
My latest project is to write a HTTP anonymizer--sort of like a bit launderer.  The plan would be to allow a server to be browsed without actually giving away its real address by using a proxy.
The client would have an encrypted URL that would be passed to the proxy.  The proxy, using its own private key would decrypt the real URL and make the  HTTP request to the server.  This would opaque the server's identity from the client.
While this sounds all well and good, unless there are multiple proxies deployed a-la Mixmaster with encapsulated encryption, there is the threat that the proxy would be able to match up server-client pairs.
In any case, I'm open to suggestions on this project--its very open ended and should be done in a couple of months.
If anyone would like a copy of the work done mail me and I'll send you a PS: Does anyone know of any French COMPUSEC firms that I could contact?  I'd like to try to get a job there for next year.

Transfer of credentials is a big problem in terms of computer based Authentication is traditionally carried out in one of three forms:
*	Authentication by knowledge(passwords)
*	Authentication by posession(key cards)
*	Authentication by being(biometrics)
With the first two, which are overwhelmingly popular and cheap, the transfer of credentials is trivial.
Even if they're not anonymous credentials, the fact that I can hand someone my driver's licence to swipe through a card reader next to a machine is a simple example of transfer of credentials problem.
