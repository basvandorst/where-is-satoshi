@_subject: Newbie question on PGP 
I had heard about PGP and have been meaning to get and use it Real Soon Now for a few weeks.  When I heard it was an endangered species, I started looking around seriously.  Haven't found it yet, but I did find cypherpunks (I'm not sure if this is a blessing or a curse, but it is entertaining).  Anyway, can someone point me to an ftp site that still stocks PGP?  I'm running SunOS4.1.1 if that matters.

Thanks all for the pointers (I came back from a meeting to find > 20 messages telling me where to go!  Now that's response).
Thanks all who responded.
