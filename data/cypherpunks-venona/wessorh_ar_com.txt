I liked your description of Brans Cash. I'd like to turn your description into psudo-code or Perl whichever comes first and you are more comfortable
with reviewing. Anyone lese interested in developing a bit of perl as an
example of Brands cash in action?

@_subject: Brands cash in perl 
Below are two Perl psudo-Functions as I see Brands Cash as described by Hal (hfinney Am I comming close or am I way off,
Personally I understand code better than the written word and I can
loose lots in the translation. If this is on the "right track" then where does $g come from, can I take it from the modulo of a PGP # mPrime(m') is passed as $CASH with the two submitter generated # Check values $A and $B. &GetChallenge returns the random challenge # we requested as $c0, the two additional ones ($c1 and $c2) were
# supplied by the depositor.
sub Deposit{
  local($CASH, $A, $B) =   if(($A*$B) == $CASH){
      ($c0, $c1, $c2) = &GetChalenge
      $Catch = $A*($B ^ $c0);
      $Check = $Amt^$c1*$g^$c2;
      if($Catch == $Check){
         sql("insert into account Balacne=Balance+$CASH");
         print "ALL OK; CASH Accepted\n";
      }else{
         print "Double Spender!!\n"
         &CatchCriminal($CASH);
      }else{
         print "You Lie!!!\nStop making up stuff\n";
         &CatchCriminal($CASH);
   }
# Supplied with a users account number, however this happens via a form
# or E-Mail, we generate m' and sign and deliver it... sub mPrime{
   local($Acct, $Amt, $g) =    $RandomNumber = &GetHugeRandomNumber
   $Acct = sql("Lookup $Person's Account");
   sql("update Balance=Balance-$Amt where AccountID=$Acct");
   $CASH = $Amt**$RandomNumber * $g**($Acct*$RandomNumber);
   sql("Intert $CASH into outstanding insterments");
   return(&Signed($CASH));

I'm in the process of adding the mpi library that comes with PGP in perl,
Perl is fairly extensible... I just figured that it would be a good common ground for codeing...

@_subject: Perl interface to GNU MultiPrecision lib 
I'm putting the finishing touches on the perl <--> gnu (gmp) multi
precision package. If any are interested in the source drop me a note
and I'll fire off the source to you... I'm not going to implement the lowlevel functions or the Berkeley compatability routines, this is just the integer functions...
While playing with this stuff I was wondering if transfering binaries in base 36 would offer any compression/mime enableing features, It was the
first time I'd seen something in base 36. Allong these lines would base(ASCII) do me a bit of good? guess I've just had too much coffee...
It's not too bad on the preformance thing and looks great for prototypeing
some of these protocols that call for big int's.
At anyrate I should expect my first version ready for public consumption
on monday or tuesday if any are interested....

@_subject: Re: Cash, cheaters, and anonymity 
I've finished implementing the GNU mp library in perl of which I've already extended to work with an Object Relational Database. All this together gives me very fast access to numbers in the order of 8192
digets in base 36, geesh I have no clue as to how many base 10 digits that is but I feel that its proabably enough to play with some digital cash
So those that want to start formulating some REAL implementations of protocols of digital cash I'm offering to run the "virtual bank" and implement the server side protocols. I'd like to see how some of these theries realy work in practice, yes I'd encourage double spending as soon as we can get some apps up to accept whatever we decide upon for the cash protocol. I'd like to see if all the discussions about digital cash
can realy work!!!
would anyone else like to put their (virtual) money where their mouth
(or keyboard) is ?

@_subject: ?-line cash 
It seems that off-line cash is dead or so the latest posts assure me,
is there a way to incorporate some of the anonymity with off-line cash
into on-line cash? I've stoped tring to code up an off-line experenemt unless anyone thinks it worthwhile. The last on-line cash system I tried to work up didn't
have a drop of anonymity to it, and I don't know how to blind the bank to the transactions but keep the thing reliable and secure...
I liked brands cash untill some of the holes were poked into it, so
any suggested on-line systems to model?
As far as crypto not being promoted you may want to check out the RFC
on Secure HTTP which uses PGP or RIPEM. CommerceNet is codeing the stuff
up and is supposed to give a finished implementation to NCSA late in sept.
CERN has come out with a nother spec thich uses the SecureDE implementation
of Public-Key crypto... As far as the WWW goes it's full steam ahead on
using crypto for business transactions. See the electronic check writing
demo at commerce net (

@_subject: Golbal Econ. 
With topics like buying a car with digital cash make me think some
may be missing my point. I don't want to replace all currencies world wide with some implementation of digital cash, be it an on or off-line
system. I would like to help get an internet economny going! For the internet
to become a source of greater revenue I'd like to see a system that can securely make business transactions that we are all happy with. The amounts should be small transactions compaired with selling a car, I'd like to know how I can pay for some online information without having to have an account based with the information supplier. For
starters how can I pay for some HTML page or purchase a physical product
via CURRENT technologies on the internet.
Lets first start an internet cash system before you go off and let our
ego's make all other forms of hard currency obsolette.

UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
              CONSTITUENT ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEM
        We welcome your inquiry to the House of Representatives
Constituent Electronic Mail System.  Currently, fortythree Members of
the U.S. House of Representatives have been assigned public electronic
mailboxes that may be accessed by their constituents.  The nature and
character of the incoming electronic mail has demonstrated that this
capability will be an invaluable source of information on constituent
opinion.  We are now in the process of expanding the project to other
Members of Congress, as technical, budgetary and staffing constraints
        A number of House committees have also been assigned public
electronic mailboxes.  The names and electronic mailbox addresses of
these committees are listed below after the information about
participating Representatives.
        Please review the list of participating Representatives below,
and if the Congressional District in which you reside is listed, follow
the instructions below to begin communicating by electronic mail with
your Representative.  If your Representative is not yet on-line, please
be patient.

                    INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONSTITUENTS
     The list above includes the electronic mail addresses of members
who are participating in the program.  However, if your Representative
is taking part in the project, we request that you send a letter or
postcard by U.S. Mail to that Representative at the address listed above
with your name and internet address, followed by your postal
(geographical) address. The primary goal of this program is to allow
Members to better serve their CONSTITUENTS, and this postal contact is
the only sure method currently available of verifying that a user is a
resident of a particular congressional district.
        In addition, constituents who communicate with their
Representative by electronic mail should be aware that Members will
sometimes respond to their messages by way of the U.S. Postal Service.
This  method of reply will help to ensure confidentiality, a concern
that is of upmost importance to the House of Representatives.

purpose of this mailbox is to support public inquiry about the
House Constituent Electronic Mail System.  Messages intended for
Members of Congress should be sent directly to the appropriate
Member of Congress at their electronic mail or postal address.
UPDATES AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
         From time to time, you may want to send another e-mail message

        Thank you again for contacting the House of Representatives'
Constituent Electronic Mail System.  We are excited about the
possibilities that e-mail has to offer, and will be working hard to
bring more Members on-line and to expand our services.

I thought you guy's would enjoy this...
I found out Nicholas Negroponte, the author of "being Digital" encoded a message in the spine of the book
all ones and zeros. It's a decent book, and not much about crypto except for the spine. I made a text file mof the 1260 bits on the spine.
a sample perl script is included to grab the bits.
Next mont's issue of wired is supposed to have a discussion about the spine and the encrypted messages.
the only hint I've got is:

I know how you guys love this stuff, he says it's (the code) is unbreakable...
