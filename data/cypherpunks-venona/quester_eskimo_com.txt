The author of this editorial is the Siegel of Cantor and Siegel fame, nicht wahr?
Perhaps someone with detailed knowledge of that brouhaha should write the Examiner and point out that they allowed their editorial page to be used for ex parte pleading by one of the worst offenders in the history of the Internet -- and without informing their readers they were doing so.

I don't know about the rest of these suggestions, but I am reasonably sure that using a fake social security number is a violation of federal law -- no matter what the user's motivation may have been.

"A letter to the editor is like spitting into the wind", you say.  Well, yeah...but with enough spit, the wind may change.  So everyone should write letters to the editor....and make copies for your congressman while you're at it.  This is absolutely the most effective action you can take for 64 cents.

After reading the lawyer's threatening letter I tried to check out the two newsgroups mentioned, and was told they do not exist.  (This is not a local filter here; Eskimo does not censor newsgroups.)  So have they been deleted?  If so, by whom and how? What is 'rmgroup' and who has the authority to remove alt. groups?

So....once we get past what seems to be your utter refusal to consider the possibility that government could ever do anything right ....how do we ensure that those skyscrapers don't fall down on us?  That the surgeon who is going to open me up knows something about surgery?  That my money is at least somewhat safe in the bank?
If you are willing to trust your life to Adam Smith's 'invisible hand', then good luck to you.  I prefer to see the hand out on the table.

I'm afraid that  `nobody' is imperfect.
This reporter, who probably knows little about the Internet or any of the issues under discussion except what he has read in the press, has posted a presumably sincere request for information.  He is  *asking* to learn

This is an example of reasoning by extremes, which always becomes reductio ad absurdum.
Unrestricted individual freedom leads to unrestricted freedom of `private' corporations.  Private corporations uncurbed by society's law are autarkies: internally totalitarian, externally predatory, as amoral as Is this the shape of the future you seek?

Very good point.
Not very good point.  Monsters come in many hues and `totalitarianism' is rarely total.

Yes, and some years ago a State legislature (I forget which) passed a
resolution setting the value of pi at exactly 3.  I'm not sure how they
planned to enforce their will.  Do you know how the Texas judge means to
enforce his?

I guess you don't know anyone who expects to do extensive business in
China during the 21st Century.
Right now everyone in China who can do so is frantically trying to learn
English, the international language.  But as China lumbers massively back
to its historic place among the world's greatest powers, its deference to
foreign tongues may be expected to decline.

The fact that you choose not to charge for your time does not make your
time worthless.  The value your voluntary efforts add should be assigned
due compensation even if you choose to waive it.
The failure to take such contributions into account is one of the most
serious flaws in all current economic paradigms.  I think this will become
more apparent in decades to come, as old concepts of `work' and `jobs'
