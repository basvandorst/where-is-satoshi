Corporate espionage is very common in todays business world.  This is very well known and documented in the press.  If I was the head of a corporation, I would be VERY interested in encryption technology in order to safeguard my corporate interests.
For individuals, it's sorta like the difference between standard snail mail envelopes and post cards.  The post card can be read by anyone whom the card passes, while an envelope makes the message inside somewhat private.  (I.E. it takes law enforcement to legally open the message)  While this only works on a very basic level to explain to a lay-person, perhaps it is a way for them to begin to understand.
Another way of looking at it is the difference between private phone lines like we have today (yes, I know, not TRUELY private, but you get the point) and party lines of old.
 -->3.  Why we have a right to strong encryption.
Actually, our constitution does not say we have the right to private communication.  It would be nice, but it's not a right.

 -->4.  How the Clipper implementation infringes on our rights.
See  above.  Clipper is just plain a bad idea.  Unfortunately, I suspect everyone's a bit late on this one.  Newspapers have already written about a huge purchase by several large government agencies of technology with the chip in place.
Funny thing is, it may end up being only our govenment who's security is comprimised by this action, since no one else wants anything to do with it.  Especially after the current mole uncovering, I begin to wonder if it's yet more moles who are pushing this technology forward.  After all, if there is a backdoor, you KNOW every country in the world will try to get in.  Of course, this defeats the entire purpose of security.

Sorry, didn't get a chance to finish in my previous message...
 -->4.  How the Clipper implementation infringes on our rights.
 -->
As previous message, it's not a right according to our constitution.  However, the argument could be made that public encryption is allowed under free speech in a couple of ways:
1) by preventing "the government" from listening in, persons are able to speak freely where normally they would not.  This would, of course, be superseded by the government's ability to protect itself from treason.  In addition, it could be argued that encryption allows people to unlawfully speak against others, or to incite riots, etc.
2) it could be argued that an encrypted message is nothing more than "another language".  Just because someone can't understand it, does not invalidate it.
 -->5.  Arguments for/against Clipper, key escrow, and DoJ implementation.
 -->
"Law enforcement" will always be in favor of having the ability to listen in.  That has and always will be of utmost concern to them.
 -->6.  Why public (read congressional) hearings are needed.
 -->    e.g. Administration rationale for clipper.
 -->         Abuse of key escrow.
 -->         Guarantee to alternative encryption.
 -->         Guarantee to import/export of encryption.
 -->
Import/Export.  This one gets tricky.  I can understand the reasons WHY the agencies don't want any tech exported.  Any encryption that's exported gets in the hands of "enemy agents" and will be worked on to be broken.  The more that's out there, the more that's being cracked.  What makes sense to me would be for each agency to develop it's OWN proprietary algorithms, which already exist, or develop a mix between encryption and virus software such that the encryption algorithm actually modifies itself over time.  This may ultimately be the "unbreakable" code.
Everything becomes touchy when you speak of national defense.  It is, of course, of vital importance.  On the other hand, it's often the most guarded "secrets" which are "fake" just to throw off the enemy.  Perhaps this clipper thing is just a trick to pull out some more moles.

Perhaps so, but the Supreme Court saying something does not a "right" make.  Free speech is a right which does NOT allow anyone to say anything they wish, and it does not guarantee privacy from government interferance so long as there is probable cause for law enforcement to interfere.
Remember as well, you must ASK the government for permission to sue it, which is how something gets to the Supreme Court, after possibly years of Not to mention that many agencies don't NEED ANY approval to take actions.  Notice the FBI/CIA recent mole... they have not been found guilty, yet every belonging has been forfeited.  Of course, everyone's "pretty sure" they're guilty, but ...

Sandy, please re-read what I said... "private communication".  If this were a right, then wiretapping AT ALL would be illegal, and it is not.
Don't get me wrong.  I am all for private communications.  I'm very much against restricting the public's access to encryption technology.  What gets me is when everyone runs around saying "this is a right".

Good question... what exactly is a "right"?  To me, a right is something that cannot be removed from any citizen.  I would like to see privacy as a right.  However, at what point do you draw the line?  When does privacy interfere with someone else's rights?
Freedom of speech has never been a right.  A lot of people think it is.  But go out on a street corner and try to incite a riot.  See what happens.  Or threaten someone.  Or commit treason.  Speech is not a right.
I don't pretend to have all the answers.  But I see a lot of folks very mis-informed about the difference between a right and a benefit of                lyled
