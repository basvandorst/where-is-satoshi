This is exactly the sort of information manipulation that can create a chain reaction on the net.  The infamous modem tax is a good example of this sort of cascade effect.  Use of "hot button" terms can product astonishing effects.
Yawn--this is the same old crappy broadcast paradigm that every govt drone that has looked at the net insists on regurgitating out of their craw.  The nature of the net is that everyone is a broadcaster, and the concept of a band of Newt-clones spamming the net is annoying.  It's good that these people are this clueless--someone that selectively and judiciously inserted a few posts here and there on appropriate newsgroups could have quite an effect, given an understanding of the language manipulation techniques mentioned above.

This gets right down to one of the fundemental differences between Usenet news and the WWW.  The Web is essentially a broadcast model for information exchange, even though everyone can publish their own Web page.  News & mailing lists, OTOH, give everyone involved an opportunity to respond and point out stuff that is complete bullshit.  Until you can hang responses off of Web pages, it will never give the value of the newsgroups and mailing lists, despite all the fancy fonts and glitzy graphics on the Web pages.

Still, messages intended for the DH could be identified by the publically known mailer address.  Some sort of protocol where each message to the remailer results in a new and different encrypted send-to block being returned to the sender would seem to be required.  Avoiding traffic analysis on these messages would require you to place a new and different encrypted reply-to on each message chunk.
I was assuming this--on the basis that the DH would not want its location know to the presumeably large number of clients.

Perhaps I missed this, but why?  If someone is going to plant kiddie porn or whatever on you, does it really matter if they encrypt it first or not?
If the purpose is simply to generate additional encrypted traffic to obscure stuff that needs encryption, that goal might be better served by simply encrypting files for their recipient as they pass through, in those cases where a public key is available and the msg isn't already encrypted.
I forget the name of the cypher (Vigere, perhaps--the one that uses a series of Caesar-like cyphers keyed by a password), but you could just run it through that with a password of abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz and you'd flatten out the distribution enough to get it by casual inspection.

This seems overly complicated.  If Dave has a known public key, then Alice should be able to hash her file, sign the hash, encrypt (the hash, her public key, and the file) with Dave's public key, and (anonymously) sends the result to Dave's (encrypted) address.  Dave then decrypts, verifies the sig, and stores the file, hash, and PK together, indexed by the hash.
When Alice wants the file back, she signs (the hash and her encrypted return address), encrypts the result with Dave's key, and sends it off.  Dave decrypts the request, fetchs the public key based on the decrypted hash, verifies the signature, encrypts the file with Alice's provided public key, and sends it back to the encrypted return address. To avoid Dave's knowing the file contents, Alice can encrypt it before the described protocol and decrypt it afterwards.  The protocol is subject to a replay attack, but the result of the replay would cause the file to be sent to the original sender and not to the replayer.
The signed hash in the first step prevents people from spamming Dave with files that have Alice's public key.  Alice only requires an encrypted address and public key for Dave, and Dave validates the retrieval request against the public sent in the first step.

True enough.
The big problem I have with mandatory encryption for remailers is that it thwarts one of the two major purposes of remailers.  Basically I see remailers serving two goals:
        1)  Defeating traffic analysis of point-to-point communications.
            Mandating encryption for this is redundant--anyone who wanted this
            would be encrypting their mail to begin with.  Also, I don't                    believe this mode of operation generates many complaints.
        2)  Anonymous broadcast transmission.  This one can generate a lot of
            complaints, but it is also very important for things like *.recovery
            newsgroups.  Mandating encryption renders this mode useless.
There is a third use, which is anonymous point-to-point transmission.  While this is of some benefit for anonymous tip line, it makes things like mailbombs and hate mail very easy.

The whole point of a "data haven" is that the site of operation is in a jurisdiction where these things are not legal problems.  If you operate a DH in a location where child pornography/copyright laws are vigorously enforced, I really doubt that encryption is going to make any difference.  As Robert rightly points out, a DH probably will become a location of massive copyright violation, etc ad nauseum.

I wasn't referring to requiring encryption using the remailer's public key.  I was referring to the stuff discussed here, where the remailer operator insists on ensuring that the traffic is encrypted over and beyond the remailer's public key, in order to give the operator plausable deniability.
Really, all inbound remailer traffic should be encrypted with the remailer's public key if any significant level of security is desired.

Quite possibly the timestampers would be in trouble, the risk for them is the same as the risk for the remailers and the DH operators.  As long as some piece of info is considered to be a thought-crime, everyone who accepts info from a wide range of sources is at risk.
That would still be a useful service, however, but it does transfer the risk from the DH operator to the encryptor.  Since he isn't leaving evidence on a hard drive, his window of vunerability is somewhat less.

I'm not sure how encryption chages the equation if that van on the street can read the data off your screen and/or printer.  Just as cryptanalysis is a necessary component of good cryptography, some sort of VanEck analysis would seem to be required in order to evaluate the utility of methods to block it.
What exactly would one need to do to block Van Eck monitoring?  I've seen computer rooms that were completely lined with copper sheathing.  Is it really necessary to go to that extent?

[6] IRS Initiates Massive New Database
On December 20, the Internal Revenue Service announced in the Federal
Register that it was planning a new database to monitor compliance of
taxpayers in a project entitled Compliance 2000.  The database would
contain information on all individuals in the U.S. who conduct certain
financial transactions and would be segmented by different criteria:
The new database will combine private and public sector databases in a
single searchable entity.  A number of federal financial databases
from the IRS will be enhanced with state, local and commercial
sources. The Federal Register notice describes the non-tax databases:
Finally, even though the proposed system would use frequently
inaccurate "commercial databases" such as direct marketing records,
taxpayers would not be able to review their records to ensure that
they are accurate and up to date:  "This system is exempt from the
access and contest provisions of the Privacy Act."
EPIC is filing comments asking the IRS to reconsider its use of
commercial databases and to ensure that there are greater safeguards
on the collection and use of personal information.
A copy of the Federal Register notice is available at cpsr.org
Comments on the proposed system must be received by January 19, 1995,
and sent to Office of Disclosure, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Conn.

Y'know, after some thought, some of the concepts I made regarding data havens with anonymous locations might well apply to making exit-point remailers that are relatively immune from outside pressure.  Given a network of entry-point remailers with well-known public keys, you could advertise an exit-point remailer by only giving out encrypted address blocks for use with various well-known entry-point remailers and a public key.  The exit-point remailer could then substitute some random From: address and path entries to spoof the exit-point remailer's location.  The remailer's actual location would only be known by the entry point remailers, and since their involvement is stripped by the exit-point remailers, no one would know who they are to complain to them.
The spoofed exit-point remailer location could be handled by disposable MX entries, of the sort discussed here earlier, if it is deemed desireable to make the From: address valid.  The remailer operator could get the actual complaints, to deal with as he would.
