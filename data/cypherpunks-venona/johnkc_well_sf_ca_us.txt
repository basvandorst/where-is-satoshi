I'm an engineer at a TV station, one of our microwave receivers
at the 800 foot level of our broadcast tower has been getting an
odd  signal for almost 3 weeks, it's  black and white video of a
house and it's on 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Out of curiosity
I decided to find the house, it wasn't too hard I knew the
bearing and I knew exactly what the house looked like.
It turns out the house is in a middle class neighborhood in
Miramar Florida (about 30 miles north of Miami). The tiny
camera and antenna are crudely mounted with duct tape on a
telephone pole across the street , it looks like it taps into
the power lines for electricity. Nobody would ever notice it
unless you knew precisely where to look and what to look for.
We are receiving the signal at 2458 megacycles but I think
that's a second harmonic, the primary signal must be at 1229 meg, a government frequency, known to be used by the DEA.

@_subject: Khufu 
In the April Dr. Dobb's ( page 20 ) it say's that Khufu is
insecure because the key is only 64 bits long ; I was always
under the impression that Khufu was 512 bits long ( 64 BYTES ).
Have I been misinformed?

@_subject: BOYCOTT AT&T 
It seems that the Government of the USA has been interfering
with the free market to reward AT&T , I don't know how much
AT&T's support of the Clipper Chip had to do with it but I'm
sure it didn't hurt.  In the May 13 New York Times:
        >The AT&T Corporation's winning bid for a $4 billion contract to
        >modernize Saudi Arabia's phone system ,WHICH HAD BEEN SUPPORTED
        >BY HEAVY CLINTON ADMINISTRATION LOBBYING , was hundreds of
        >millions of dollars higher than other bids [...] The huge-scale
        >deal, which was announced on Monday is the biggest
        >telecommunications contract in history.
I think it's important for company's to realize there is also a
downside for supporting Clipper. As a start ,I don't see how any
self respecting Cypherpunk or Extropian could use AT&T as their
personal long distance carrier . AT&T 's not the only company in
bed with the government over Clipper (INTEL) but it is the most
visible and the easiest to boycott, MCI and Sprint do a fine
job. If  5% of the Internet users quit AT&T it would make other
companies think twice before they endorse Clipper.

I found this in the May 6 issue of Science:
        >At the same press conference where Lenstra and company announced
        >the defeat  of RSA-129,he promised a "surprise" for the next

        >perhaps a test involving a number with quite a  few more digits

Then I found this in the May 7 issue of Science News:
        >In a startling theoretical result that could call into question
        >any  cryptosystem based on factoring, Peter W Shore of AT&T Bell
        >Laboratories in  Murray Hill, N.J., has just proved that

By "easy" I presume they mean solvable in Polynomical time. I'm
not saying the writing is on the wall or anything but it might
be prudent to start thinking about Diffe-Hellman, perhaps using
elliptic curves.

@_subject: Shore on Quantum Computers 
I found this in sci.crypt, its by Peter Shore, the mathematician
who caused the resent excitement by finding a way to program a
quantum computer to factor numbers AND find discrete logarithms
in polynomial time. I realize nobody has even made a quantum
logic element yet, much less a working computer but the
implications are breathtaking.
