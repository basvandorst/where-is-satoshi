The Secret Service also refer to devices that record incoming phone numbers as pen registers.

I believe that they do.  I dialed tons of extraneous  when I thought I was being DNRed.  I also discussed various bogus murders with some of my friends.. it was quite interesting.

My local Bell in (810) has a free system called "touch-4."  It's just a voicemail system but it has airline schedules and the cheapest rates if you give it a destination and a date.  You need to listen to a couple commercials but it's a free call for me.  I don't know if any of this information is on the net.

Perhaps mandatory encryption will be struck down by a court.  It seems to me that if the government portrays this as a "safe" method of encryption criminals can make the claim that they would not have committed crimes if they didn't feel that their encryption was secure.  Since the government promotes this false sense of security the government may in fact "create" additional crime.
I am not saying that I believe this argument.. it is, however, one that can be made.
