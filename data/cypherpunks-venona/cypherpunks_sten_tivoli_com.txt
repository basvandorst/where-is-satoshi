record for sten.tivoli.com, but any incoming email to me is
intercepted by proxy.tivoli.com, as is all other incoming traffic to
the internal tivoli.com network on port 25.  Since 'incoming' is only
a matter of definition, it would be trivial for an ISP to set up a
firewall that passed all other ports through transparently, but
redirected connections with a destination of port 25 to their own SMTP
government goons requiring ISPs to do this, but don't sit back and
relax with the notion that 'it can't be done'.

are free to do so (constrained by their own constitutions).  For that
matter, the federal government shouldn't be involved in the business
of affecting the specific welfare of individuals, so it should be a
moot issue.  But they cover everything by the commerce clause ("A bird
landing on your roof will travel between states during migration, so
we can regulate the construction of your house."), so they do it

Rebellion', 1791-4, western Pennsylvania.  Mr Washington, one of those
framers, sent American troops (militia, under federal control) against
American citizens on American soil.  And I don't recall Mr Washington
being impeached for violating the Constitution (although Jefferson did
resign as Secretary of State, in part, over this).  A page with some
discussion of this is ,
but I think it's too optimistic on one point.  It says that without
the 'Rebellion' "the government of today might be the aristocratic
monarchy that Hamilton and the Federalists tried so hard to install".
It may have delayed it, but our government certainly seems to rule
based on the Divine Right of Bureaucrats.

regardless of what uniforms it's dressed in.  I forgot that it's so
much nicer to be shot by the New Jersey National Guard than the US
Marine Corps.  And Washington sent in the militia only because he
didn't have enough 'regular' troops.

Congress giveth, Congress can taketh away - and did.  I don't recall

the military as police, domestically or abroad, is a bad idea.  I'm
just not certain which is worse.

response of Congresscritters who have been gotten to is "If you only

implies someone choosing what algorithm to be the standard.  Better is publicly known formats and algorithms, so that the strengths of the
algorithms can be tested, and multiple products can implement the same formats and algorithms, and compete on the basis of features and
usability, rather than FUD-based claims of security.  This may result
in multiple formats and algorithms being used, and that's all for the
best, so that when one algorithm is compromised, others are available
to be switched to.

"There's nothing we can do for you."  The dismissive doctor's words
echo in the old vagrant's head as he's ejected from a hospital.
Moments later, the other voices return.  They're about to take him on
a journey to the dark heart of America in UNCLE SAM, a two-issue
Prestige Format VERTIGO miniseries, fully painted by award-winning
painter Alex Ross (KINGDOM COME) and written by Steve Darnall (the
Eisner Award-nominated Empty Love Stories).
Clad in star-spangled rags, a man named Sam wanders city streets,
struggling to remember his true identity.  As the voices in his head
begin to make a terrible kind of sense, they set off time-traveling
visions that drag him through the worst of his nation's history, while
hinting that he may have a violent past of his own.
Is he Uncle Sam - or one of U.S.?
Through it all, a mysterious woman keeps appearing, staying just out
of reach.  Is she Sam's lover, ally, or just, in the end, a madman's
dream?  He won't have all the answers until he reaches "a white city
by the unsalted sea" - and a most formidable foe.
Darnall and Ross team up for a multilayered look at the failed dreams
and fallen heroes of a nation under siege...from itself.  Told through
a mystery man's eyes, UNCLE SAM sweeps from the Revolutionary War to
the Dust Bowl and beyond.  In his VERTIGO debut, Alex Ross takes his
remarkably realistic style to new heights, using spectacular splash
pages and a wide-ranging palette to bring America's darkest historical
moments - as well as a hallucinatory parade of other American icons -
to life.
