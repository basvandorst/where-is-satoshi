Theft could be from thoes who do not protect there property and from thoes who do not respect others property, so can it also be said that 'bad government' can be from people not protecting there rights and people who have no respect for the rights of others? Michael Conlen

Some belive that human action is automatic, while semming to be by choice, that the past of this persones life defines how they will react to a certin situation. I do however agree that someone does decide on there own that they will commit a criminal act, however if people protected themselves would they be acted apon? If you use PGP does someone else read your E-Mail? If not what happens? (assumming that you are writing something that someone else will want to intercept, ect.)
I have known many people to be this way. They will and DO take every advantage of any situation they can. The United States is made up of ignorant people who know what they need to get by in life, and do not want to take the time to do what it takes to improve themselves, ie. vote. As for morality, I feel it is somthing that we all wish to be but find it hard to be. I know I find it hard to be moral.

Lets say a place wont hire blacks, and you happend to be black, and wanted to work for such a company. Would you do what you can to hide your color, if possible, to get hired, then let them try to fire you over it, or would you decide that you wouldnt want to work for this company at all? What if MOST companys had this policy... ...and the ones that didnt, wouldnt pay anyone what they are worth. What then?
If one or two companys would be the ones deciding what to do based on this information then I wouldnt see much problem in it, I would choose to do buisness with other companys based on there ethic, however I dont think many companys that I will do buisness with are the likes that wont use anything they can get there hands on. Assuming this to be true, it could be very difficult to live if every company knew I was such and such. Groove on Dude

Only ment as an example... ...not as an accuatual pratice. I agree that a company that praticed thoes polices would not make it far. The Minority is enough to pull a company down on there own. The Minority has friends that are not minority. Enough to quickly bankrupt the comany. Hiring pratices based on things other then the quality of work produced is another thing. Groove on dude

They have your current name and current address... ...anyone who has worked with credit reporting services can tell you that thoes two things are enough to get your Social Security number. The person getting the informaiton may have already had the number in front of her. With your name and address someone can find out what your date of birth is. In many states that is enough for a drivers licens... ...name and dob... ...anyway they also have your SSN and everyone you have owed money to in the last ten years. From your Drivers licens the story goes on. Groove on dude

For digital Encryption you would need a 900Mz phone. Finding one two lines, depending on where you are might be a bit of a search. No 40-50Mz phone I have worked with (Motorola, Toshiba, Panasonic) has used digital encrytion. I would recomend ATT (no I'm not crazy) or Panasonic.

Thats what that thing was susposed to be. I got the same things with pine, which I know is susposed to be mime aware. Anyway all this talk about it gave me an idea. A PGP mime extention, where your mail says that you have a PGP encoded message, enter secret pass phrase to contiue. I think this would do a couple of things

@_subject: Re: MIME (again) 
True, I never want to foce people to use something, however an application so universily used such as e-mail would make a good place to present PGP and allow people to have access to it without downloading and compiling PGP for their selves, for each computer that uses PGP, ect. If PGP remains as obscure to thoes not intrested in crypto, then I think the program will not reach the people it is intented for, the masses. Not everyone knows how to compile a program, or has the intrest in it enough to read the docs that come with it to set it up. this is the reason I have not used it yet, beacuse of just getting it set up.

As I understand it, the government owns a portion of the internet. What they want to regulate about that is their business. What I want to know is how can they regulate what private business and citizen's do with there Fiber Optic's, ISDN lines, telephone lines, and computers. If the government was to ban anything on the net, it would shurly seem to me to be in violation of the first ammenment. Things like pirated software, being illegal already, is one thing, but our mail, conversations, ect. is diffrent. plan to use for legislation? If they do pass laws regulating the 'net I hope someone comes up with a no-spamming law, then I am getting a ticket on Jon Coopers plane out of the country.

A big difference between the 'net and some of the above, is that the net has been around in a very large presence (internatonaly) before the laws are being introduced, where as paging and cellular service didnt exist. As far as lawyers and doctors and lawyers, one of the big things the government does is protect agianst quacks. Not to many people are going to argue with this. The government wants to protect us from speech in the case of the 'net, well there are quite a few people who are going to stand up for their first amenment rights. If you want your own communication service, you can buy it. weather you use fiber based WAN's or go straight for satalite service, used by companies such as Holiday Inn, or Circuit City. You can exchange any information you want. I think the important thing to remember is that net access is not a right. My service provider has the right to give service to whom they please, as long as race, sex, or creed are not deciding factors. What goes across .gov and .mil computers is one thing, however what commes across sprintlink's computers to my service proveder to my computer is up to sprintlink, Intnet.net and myself. I dont care to read racist comments, so I dont view them. If I want to download nudie gifs, its my business, and right as stated under the First Amenment.

I think the worst is that the government never seems to be in the mood for giving your computer equipment back to you. Hiding your phycal location, being out of the question, (old thread), all the government has to do is drum up suspision and enough information for a warrant for your computer equipment, then your screwed out of a system. If you had a system good enough to efectivly handle DH's or even remailers, your out of a good sum of money.

I for one would not want to go in to more debt. I am in debt up to my neck due to a auto accident. I can not afford to go in to more debt. I am barely making it beacuse I owe on two loans, insurance, and money borrowed from relatives. This beacuse I thought I could afford X dollars a month more. I could if I wassnt out of work for as long as I was. When I have everything paid off, I belive I will not be borrowing anything else for a while. My question to you is, "Why borrow, if 1. you can afford to pay cash now, and 2. when you are going to have to pay more in the long run."

Thats the business of banking. In any case most business run tight net margins. Over half of the gross margin in Retail Electronics dissapears, and in some markets like Los Angeles, its as low as 6 or 7 percent.
The Credit card companys dont have a whole lot to worry about other then public image, and only a few like American Express worrys about this alot. A large portion of phone calls paid for by credit cards are declined for payment. Its the establishment that didnt check the person using the card that looses out. Mail order business take the loss when a computer is carded, beacuse they dont have a signature on hand to back up the charge. The credit card company dosent take the hit at all. American Express is the toughest of all the companys that I have delt with. While I can steal a card in the mail, sign it, and use it, at which case the person who the card was intended for can be held liable for the bill, AmEx requires that teh person who's name is on the card sign for the charge. Basicaly what it comes down to is, card companys and banks dont take the hit unless they want to for public image and customer service. What do they care if their card is being used by someone who shouldnt have it. They can decline payment at will without a signature. I in some ways hope using credit cards on the net takes off, is abused, and people go back to using cash, and checks, and buying things in person.
