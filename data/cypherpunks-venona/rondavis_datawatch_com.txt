The LC does lack a FPU, but you can get one on a card.  I'm not sure if
this would help though, because it would depend if your compilier would
generate FPU code.  I know you can with Think.  You also might need to take
into account which compiler you are using for this kind of program, there
seems to be a vairation in efficency between Mac Compilers.
As for using toolbox calls, using Apple's SANE library might help. I
haven't had much experience with it, but it would probably take advatage of
the FPU.
E-mail me if I can help anymore. (I'll run the program on my Q700 if you
just need a quick speed test.)

        It is my understanding that you can be compelled to at least
provide                    decrypted information.  In other words the court can say, "We want
        your PGP e-mail, deliever it to us in an unencrypted form."  A question
        may be how they could prove you didn't alter the information while
        decrypting.  This could be acomplished by supervising you while you
        decrypted the info, with attorneys for both parties present.  Of course
        an attorney could still argue you could change it and want the court
        to do the actual decryption, therefore demanding you turn over your key.

I just recently got MacRipem and find it much easier to use than PGP,
        and was wondering why I should use PGP over Ripem.  The above seems to
        indicate that Ripem isn't as secure.  Why is this?

@_subject: d3des code question 
Has anyone had any experience using the DES code by Richard Outerbridge
that appears in the back of Applied Crypto, and is available via ftp from
ripem.msu.edu?  Specifically can someone send me an example of how to call
the functions?

I find this to be a strange statement.  Do we have no interest
        in non-public key methods?  Seems the Cypherpunks should have
        an interest in all forms of crypto.  Most users don't currently
        use public key becuase they just want to keep thier boss from
        sitting down at thier computer and reading the resumes they wrote
        for other companies.  This can be accomplished with symetrical
        crypto just as well, if not faster than PGP.
        Cryptomatic does come with Triple DES which is still a very
        strong method.
        Unfortunatly MacPGP's biggest draw back is that its interface
        is poor and it is hard to use.  There is also MacRIPEM which is
        written by Raymond Lau, author of Stuffit, and is much easier to
        use, but weaker than PGP (but legal).
        Can't stop without mentioning that my company make a product
        called Citadel which does DES encryption.

Depends on what the required reading list for this group is.
        I thought that our purposes were to promote the privacy of
        individuals through the use of cryptography.  This can be done
        in the contexts I talked about with symmetric as well as PK crypto.
        Maybe I have the wrong idea about "our purposes", please correct me
        if I'm wrong.
        Rumor has it that Kent Marsh is working on an IDEA module for         thier products as well.
        You're right its free.  If something is free you can't really complain
        about it.  If it does anything its a bargan.
        I can live with disagreement.  Of course hopefully you would admit
        that Cryptomactics ability to select a file in the finder, pull down
        a menu and Boom encrypted file is easier than PGP's methods.

I wasn't saying that PK wasn't important, or the most important.
        I agree it is a great thing.  I was just saying that I thought
        cypherpunks was also about non-PK crypto.  I also ventured to think
        it wasn't just about PGP, but all crypto used for purposes of
        insuring individual freedom and privacy.
        I read the Wired article.  I've also read the FAQ.  Missed May's
        manifesto is it available via ftp?
        But isn't hiding things from your boss important in the
        cypherpunks worldview, even if people choose not to use
        PGP?
        Seems to me that the fact is many, if not most, people will
        not use PGP because of is outlaw status.  Many of us are attracted
        to it because of that, but many people aren't.  We can still
        advocate methods that people are comforatable with that will
        further our goals.
        If I'm wrong about the very basics of the list, then I guess this
        discussion is good, because I've been around for a couple of months
        at least and this is the idea I got.
