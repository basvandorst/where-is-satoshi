I was sympathetic to your argument up to this point. Now I need a polite way
to say "You haven't a clue as to what you're talking about.". These magic,
vest-penetrating, Teflon coated bullets are on of the gun-controllers favorite myths. But they don't exist in this reality.
That's not to say the cops don't have a problem. Pretty much any rifle will penetrate a standard vest. But then, very few of the druggies in real life have rifles.
Reading your last few paragraphs and then you tagline causes a real cognitive dissonance. Clipper is intended to make it easier for the police to catch criminals, and I have yet to hear a serious argument that it won't do that. All of the arguments are that it infringes on the legitimate rights of non-criminals.
So here you are, perfectly willing to toss out rights that ARE enumerated in the Constitution in the 2nd and 4th Amendments, yet trying to defend a much more nebulous "right to privacy"
Since you've so well defended the principle that the individual's rights are subordinate to the rights of the "innocent people" to be "safe", what rational basis do you have for opposing Clipper?
Sorry, the Constitution isn't a cafeteria. You can't pick and choose the rights you like and trash the rest.

the So if a majority of your neighbors voted to have you executed and your property divided among them, then that would be OK by you, yes?  After all, you say that "the majority can't be wrong".
The problem here, as illustrated by the quote from 'A Man for All Seasons' is that rights must be maintained and enforced *especially* when it is difficult to do so. If the government is allowed to violate rights "because they have no other option", then such violation becomes routine, and soon no right exists. It's rather like being pregnant.

I've often felt that the solution to this problem is that citizenship should not be given by birth. Everyone, whether born in the US or abroad, should have to go through roughly the present process to be granted citizenship. I'm explicitly including required study of US history and taking an oath to support the Constitution.

Same as minors who are resident aliens have now. That's quite a lot.
No. They would be treated as minors and could travel abroad only when accompanied by a citizen who is taking responsibility for them. Much like minors at present.
Yes, it's inconvenient for these new non-citizens. It's supposed to be. I agree with Heinlein that citizenship should be earned.

@_subject: Delayed self-encrypting messages 
I have a need to distribute some information fairly widely, but it's critical that it not be openly revealed before a certain date. Consider the model of an embargoed press release.
Can I do this with crypto technology? Can I send someone a message, and possible a program, such that the message can only be decrypted after a predetermined date?

You could do the simple way, distribute the message, then a key at the
later date.  To make sure the encrypted message is genuine, sign the message
encrypt it, then sign it again, to ensure that people know that the
encrypted text is okay.

@_subject: Delayed self-decrypting message 
I have a need to give several people an information file that is secured until a given date. Think of an embargoed press release for a model.
Can I do this with crypto technology? Is there a way I can send out a file and perhaps a tool such that the file can be decrypted only after a given date?
