from: john.nieder
As is the case with a good many other gov't. agencies, one can be sure
that all the crew are not 9-to-5ers showing up at one office.
It has been a good many years since I traveled in the lower strata of
these circles, but it was my information that the NSA, at least at that
time, had a manpower pool "hugely greater than the CIA's."  It is my
understanding that the NSA budget is highly classified - unavailable
even to most members of Congress.
I believe you'll find that the NSA also is involved in SATINT & ELINT
as well.  Never Say Anythings are busy little bees.
It is my belief from personal experience that the NSA requests &
receives operational assistance from those innocuous agencies in
positions to gather information of use to the NSA in the course of their
routine duties.
I've tried to read this famous tome a couple of times, but have been
unable to hack its turgid prose.  Someday. perhaps...
Excuse me, Tim?

from: john.nieder
I should like to see the body of case law on which this opinion is
based, if any.
.   Recently this question came up in another forum on encryption & an
"authority" on communications law claimed the probable scenario would be
that the arresting agency would have the encrypted material decrypted by
a competent government or academic agency & the costs of said decryption
would eventually be recovered from the defendant through civil suits,
presuming the defendant had sufficient assets.  It is my memory of the
thread that he claimed this had been done in previous cases.

From-Mail: john.nieder
From-Name: commenting on the strategy of "taking the 5th" on the matter of
# Since none of us have ever been inside the NSA, we cannot underestimate
# their power and resources.  For all we know...
This is somewhat beside the point.  In actual fact, much of the seized
encrypted evidence in criminal cases employs built-in encryption
programs in major software packages (WordPerfect is a good example)
rather than obscurer stuff like PGP/IDEA/RSA.  Even highly-touted
commercial programs like Norton Utilities DiskReet w/DES use simple
passwords of a maximum ten-character size.
.   Much of this decryption may be trivially accomplished, though many
"experts" charged law enforcement agencies stout fees for the service.
It is now known that those specializing in WordPerfect files were using
a simple program available on most BBS file bases which will crack the
"secret" WordPerfect password in seconds on an old XT.
.   Apparently, the consulting fees for breaking bad crypto in most
cases is not prohibitive.
.   Tim's objections about high-end decryption are indeed valid, at least
theoretically, but we can not tell if a given encryption program has been
backdoored or if a fatal flaw has been uncovered that reduces the
security of the cyphertext.  If any cryptanalysts might find such flaws,
they would probably be those in no position to reveal their findings.
.   Jean-Loup Gailly [an original PGP team member in France] informs me
that the same general criticisms of PGP soundness voiced in the Moscow
State University report have been independently suggested in sci.crypto,
though he is aware of no instance of these alleged weaknesses being
exploited to break a PGP message.  The jury is still out on PGP's
ultimate security, I suppose.
.   Personally, I am not counting on PGP's brute-force decryption being
a task of the magnitude Tim suggests, though I _hope_ he's right.  I
sure wish some well-equipped crypto labs like Marty Hellman's would turn
their attentions to an evaluation of PGP...

The White House E-Mail gambit is a gimmick without substance.  One -
according to a previous Cypherpunks post, the e-mail isn't getting
through; two - they want mailing addresses for acknowledgement, which is
absurd for any number of obvious reasons (take your pick or come up with
your own); finally (this is the _real_ kicker), tonight's news informs
me that the Clinton White House is making a "symbolic" cost-cutting
gesture by reducing staff "up to 25%."  Where will these reductions come
from?  "The reductions will come mostly from staff whose job is to
respond to mail from the public."
     This hoax is the biggest joke since Rush Limbaugh gave out his

There is also the problem of those (like me) who access the internet
from outside, through gates.  The messages are not only marked with the
point of origin automatically by the originating BBS's software, but are
also subject to monitoring by any number of systems operators en route
to internet.  When all of the headers (including passwords for the
anonymous servers) are in plaintext, the entire anonymous system seems
compromised.  While some servers I haven't tried yet seem to be PGPed,
this doesn't seem to be the case with penet.fi.

I just had a chilling example of why last month.  Someone who made my

discussion in a tech newsgroup and sent me a "yoo-hoo!" e-note.  I could
have gone a long time without that.  My identity was irrelevant to the
discussion, but was unfortunately very relevant to making this nasty
little surprise possible.
As the penet.fi helpfile mentions, one of the concerns was for the
privacy of those participating in theraputic discussions on such
touchy subjects as incest and abuse.  In that many theraputic
disciplines stress a confessional mode of treatment, the security
required for persons to "open up" must be (or appear to be) absolute.
These electronic therapy groups may not appeal to you or me, but they
have large followings and seem to serve a useful purpose for some.
Maximum anonymity is desirable for those participants.
I can think of several other very serious reasons for persons to desire
untracable communications, but they go beyond the scope of the matter at
More to the point, in my experience I have found very little to be
gained by revealing my true identity.  The less known about me, the
better for my personal security.  That's the whole point of the privacy
"movement."  Who I am is nobody's business but mine.

I'm surprised that you haven't had 53 replies to this already, but in
that you haven't I suppose I ought not let this go by unchallenged.
        In a _MicroTimes_ article by Jim Warren of the EFF, the
unreliability of DES was discussed at length.  In a nutshell, Marty
Hellman of Stanford broke the "unbreakable" 54-bit DES _prior to its
adoption as a standard_.  He promoted the idea of a 64-bit DES instead,
but was _opposed by the NSA_ for reasons we can all speculate upon at
length.  This opposition is the basis of the rumors (?) of DES being
backdoored by the NSA.  The upshot was that DES was adopted _after_
being demonstrably compromised.
        The postscript to this is that Hellman's proposed "unbreakable"
64-bit DES variant was later cracked as well.
        The post-postscript is an apocryphal story I personally got from
an Israeli communications tech and minor spook.  He claimed that DES was
broken by the cryptanalytic arm of Israeli intelligence _in two hours_.
        It is relatively certain that a DES-encrypted cyphertext can be
easily decrypted by well-equipped agencies.  Whether decryption is now
trivially accomplished by private parties is another question.

It must seem a thankless task sometimes, I'm sure.  One thing I noticed
about penet.fi's processing of messages is that it at least scrapes off

Please, there's no need for abuse here.  I was referring to a published
column by Jim Warren of the Electronic Frontiers Foundation in
_MicroTimes_, a Bay Area computer paper.  I do not know if you consider
Warren or the EFF to be reputable.  I assumed Warren's statements were
factual.  The assertion that Israeli intelligence made short work of DES
was presented as I got it - an interesting rumor from someone who has

I was merely relating published assertions by the EFF.  If you believe
these to be incorrect, then I'd advise you to take the issue up with
Warren.  I have no "opinion" in the matter, only suspicions.  A great
many people with academic background superior to mine also share these.
My own background is in applied rather than theoretical security.  I
defer to academics in academic matters, but know that in matters of top
security it is difficult to invest confidence in any mechanism as mired
in continuing controversy as DES.  That's all.

The problem I found was that the file was not only compressed with the

PGP22.ZIP could not be unZIPped with _either_ version's simple PKUNZIP
command, but required the 2.04 version with the -d switch in the command
   I finally got the file unZIPped, but rezipped it as a simple .ZIPfile
- without the ridiculous subdirectory - with v 1.10, which will unpack
with either version.  It's this package that I'm passing along.
