@_subject: Call for Papers 
January 31, 1996
                  Attention: Information Warriors:                 ***** CALL FOR PAPERS *****
        Please feel free to distribute this widely.
I first want to thank the thousands of people who have been so incredibly supportive of my work over the last several years, and who have helped the public debate on Information Warfare gain and sustain the momentum we have all As a result of the continued interest in the subject, my publisher has asked if I would create a 2nd. Edition with substantial updates to the original "Information Warfare" which was published in 1994. I told them that the new revised edition should include much of the thinking that has evolved on the topic in the last couple of years. Believe it or not, they agreed!
So, I am asking (begging? :-)  for a couple of things.
and bibliographic information for those already in and for those entering the field. We would greatly appreciate any and all types of references that you feel will be useful for students of Infowar today and in the future. The kinds of material we hope to include are:
and a one sentence commentary.
We will also add a credit/acknowledgments page for all of the Information Warriors who have assisted in this effort. Please supply name, title (or rank) contact info, and affiliation as you want it to appear in the book. (If you don't want your name or affiliation to appear, please so indicate and we will honor your request. (Honest . . . .)
Ideally, we will need to have a hard copy of the materials that we reference.
PLEASE RESPOND TO BETTY
facets, I am also looking for short commentaries on your particular take on Infowar - and heavens knows there are so many  . . . perhaps googols! I would like to include a large number of 500-800 word overviews, or executive summaries of topics of interest to you, comments on my work, or perhaps on the efforts that you or your org are putting into the field. I am hoping to find a balance between the civilian viewpoints and military and international ones so that students and readers can see just how much work in occurring in the field. Organizations like AFIWC and DISA (and so on) are invited to submit a similar overview of their efforts in addition to individual submissions.
It is not necessary to agree with me (that would be heresy in some cases :-)) but let's be civil about it, OK? The purpose is to get the neurons vibrating and moving the field forward. If you take issue with, or relate to specific items/topics/comments in "Information Warfare" please note page number so we can tie it all together thematically. There will be suffixes to each chapter, and I am hoping that many of the responses will comment on or add to each of the chapters.
As for credit, we will list your name, contact info, affiliation etc., along with your particular contribution. With each submission, please just say something like, "I hereby give Winn Schwartau, Interpact, Inc., and Thunders Mouth Press non-exclusive permission to use this work." That keeps the publisher happy and still lets you own your own words. If it's a personal opinion, and not an official one of your organization, a simple disclaimer like, "these are the opinions of the author, and not necessarily those of my organization." We will provide a general suffix disclaimer to that effect anyway. If it is the official view of your org, then please indicate so clearly, so we may make an accurate distinction. If we decide to edit your piece substantively, we will run it back to you for approval before printing. All we will ask is a timely return.
To get your brain thinking on the kinds of topics I am looking for:
Please consider all three Classes of Infowar when deciding what you want to say. Since you only have 500-800 words to say it, I suggest that it be clear, concise and to the point. Controversy is good. But just as good is if your comments are thought provoking and stimulate additional discussion about your subject. For each contribution we accept, (and there will be a lot we will!) we will provide a free copy of the new revised "Information Warfare: Revised Edition" (or whatever they decide to call it.)
PLEASE RESPOND TO:  BETTY
quotes" of one or two sentences for the cover and inside covers where we give full attribution. If anyone is so inclined, we are looking for a few more that comment on the existing works. PLEASE RESPOND TO BETTY
together a "Who's Who" of Information Warfare. Please supply names, contact information and brief biographies to him at CEO
Again, I want to thank everyone out there for their support, and I look forward to seeing what everyone has to say. Please send your input to
BETTY no later than February 29, 1996.
Feel free to distribute this widely and/or post as you see fit.

I can't tell which of the two authors of ths following conversation is the more paranoid, but clearly at least 1 1/2 of them are totally wrong with their assumptions about 'agenda' and 'receptiveness' and 'one-upped.' It's so obscure, I don't know whether to take it seriously or not.
BUT - if you are serious about submitting, to an international audience, I suggest that you first:
and then make informed opinions and decisions.
We openly ebncourgae and welcome controversial subjects; that's why InfoWarCon's are so successful Fromthe sounds of it, no one else would have you.   Make it intersting, cogent, contributory to the field, and meaningful. We will then take you seriously.

Class III Information Warfare: Has It Begun?
The June 2, 1996 Sunday Times from London front page headline reads:
"City Surrenders to L400 million Gangs"
And HERF Guns, Electromagnetic Pulses and sophisticated logic bombs may be At InfoWarCon II, Montreal Canada, I made reference to investigations I was conducting regarding concerted and organized attacks on up to 43 financial institutions in Europe and the US; an example of Class III Information Warfare. This issue of London Sunday Times brings a glimpse of the story that will eventually be told.
The first attack in my files dates to January 6, 1993. A trading house in London was blackmailed into paying L10million to unknown extortionists who demonstrated they could crash the company's computers at will. The next incident in the Times article is also in my files: January 14, 1993 where similar demonstrations and demands were made for this time L12.5Million. And so is the next, January 29, 1993 and another L10Million siphoned off by the bad guys. According to my figures and those in the Times article, hundreds of millions of pounds have been paid ransom in what is clearly an example of Class III Information Warfare.
According to officials in Washington, Whitehall, London, City of London Police, the National Security Agency, Kroll Associates, Bank of  England and others (in the article) the threats are credible. The attackers have the clear ability to bring trading and financial operations to a halt - exactly when they say they will. "Banks, brokerage firms and investment houses in America have also secretly paid ransom to prevent costly computer meltdowns and a collapse in the confidence  among their customers," sources said in the article.
The article discussed the advanced information warfare techniques used by the perpetrators. "According to the American National Security Agency (NSA), they have penetrated computer systems using 'logic bombs' (coded devices that can be remotely detonated), electromagnetic pulses and 'high emission radio frequency guns' which blow a devastating electronic 'wind' through the computer systems." [For a complete description of HERF Guns (coined by Schwartau in 1990), see "Information Warfare: Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway," Thunders Mouth Press, 1994] The perpetrators have also left encrypted messages, apparently bypassing the highest security levels of the systems, leaving messages such as "Now do you believe we can destroy your computers?" The NSA and other officials believe that four gangs are involved; probably one from the US and probably one from Russia. But, because the crimes are international, national borders still prevail, making investigation more difficult. Investigations and official inquiries have been in progress for some time according to the article.
Now, for a few things you will not see in the articlem, but will hopefully [if I am lucky] come out in the near future. The number of attacks is way above 40. They have been known about for almost three years, but only recently have people been willing to come out of the closet and discuss this highly sensitive issue with the media. Long briefs and analyses of these events have been submitted to high level officials and select business persons for at least a year, but to no avail. [Security by obscurity reigns all too often.] Banking is not the only industry that has been attacked and the attacks have been spread around Europe as well as Australia.
As an industry many of us have said that the only way something will really be done is if we experience a Computer Chernobyl [Peter Neumann Phrase as I recall] or as I first said in Congressional Testimony, An Electronic Pearl Harbor. Are these events the harbinger of strong reaction by the community at large? As events unfold and more information is permitted to be disseminated over the next few days and weeks, we will see.
We have essentially solved the issues of confidentiality and integrity. But, I have maintained that the real problem is going to be Denial of Service. These events are unfortunate, but clear examples of that reality. A Bank of England official also said of the incidents, "it is not the biggest issue in the banking market."  Hmmm. I have to think about that.

Class III InfoWar              Part 2                 Report from Europe
FEEL FREE TO DISTRIBUTE WIDELY
I am ostensibly  on vacation with my wife and two children ages 11 & 5 :
Here we are in Venice, Italy  but I can't ignore what seems to be going on in England. American media does not appear to be  following it.  So  here 's  what is happening.
Headline of  June 9, 1996  Sunday  Times in London reads:
"Secret Inquiry into Cyber Terror."
This is a follow-up of last Sundays story about alleged extortion attacks against British financial institutions using Trojan Horses and /or HERF Guns.
According to today's article, the British government  is holding  secret investigations into the "attacks" for more than two years involving the Dept. of Trade and Industry  (DTI), government communications headquarters (GCHQ),  the Brits NSA, The Defence Research Agency (DRA), and the Bank of England.
On June 8, the DTI issued a public statement which included : "We are very interested in the allegations of extortion directed at City of London institutions which were brought to our attention in 1994.  We responded then by involving many government organizations ... so far we have not been presented with any hard evidence from victims.  We would urge those threatened to come DTI Director of Technical Affairs, David Hendon wrote a letter in May 1995 saying they took the extortion issue "Extremely seriously."  The Times' reporter's say they have seen some of the evidence that was submitted to DTI and GCHQ which includes  a chart on 46 of the attacks. According to the article DRA Senior  Director,  Professor David Parks, his agency is  " especially interested in the "weaponry" deployed by the cyber terrorists."
The Tmes continued  : "The agency (DRA) believes high intensity radio frequency "HIRF" guns may have been used to black out trading positions in City finance houses.

Class III InfoWar              Part 2                 Report from Europe
FEEL FREE TO DISTRIBUTE WIDELY
I am ostensibly  on vacation with my wife and two children ages 11 & 5 :
Here we are in Venice, Italy  but I can't ignore what seems to be going on in England. American media does not appear to be  following it.  So  here 's  what is happening.
Headline of  June 9, 1996  Sunday  Times in London reads:
"Secret Inquiry into Cyber Terror."
This is a follow-up of last Sundays story about alleged extortion attacks against British financial institutions using Trojan Horses and /or HERF Guns.
According to today's article, the British government  is holding  secret investigations into the "attacks" for more than two years involving the Dept. of Trade and Industry  (DTI), government communications headquarters (GCHQ),  the Brits NSA, The Defence Research Agency (DRA), and the Bank of England.
On June 8, the DTI issued a public statement which included : "We are very interested in the allegations of extortion directed at City of London institutions which were brought to our attention in 1994.  We responded then by involving many government organizations ... so far we have not been presented with any hard evidence from victims.  We would urge those threatened to come DTI Director of Technical Affairs, David Hendon wrote a letter in May 1995 saying they took the extortion issue "Extremely seriously."  The Times' reporter's say they have seen some of the evidence that was submitted to DTI and GCHQ which includes  a chart on 46 of the attacks. According to the article DRA Senior  Director,  Professor David Parks, his agency is  " especially interested in the "weaponry" deployed by the cyber terrorists."
The Tmes continued  : "The agency (DRA) believes high intensity radio frequency "HIRF" guns may have been used to black out trading positions in City finance houses. The weapon disables a computer by firing elctromagnetic radiation at it and is  a "Black Programme" at the Defence Ministry, one of the highest security classification levels."
In Dec. Of 1995, the DRA and Parks approached a company who specializes in information warfare and asked them to "arrange a demonstration of a portable HIRF weapon in Germany."
The article further states that details on the HIRF systems and their use in the City of London have been compiled by a British computer magazine and are being passed onto government officials.

Attacks on the Financial Sector: Reprise
I've spent the last two weeks in Europe, five countries, an avarage of 2.6 countries per day. Two kids and a wife along for a 'family vacation' which I have concluded is a modern day oxymoron. I'm thankfully back on the road to DC and Atlanta, sans kids, in a few days for a well earned rest.  :-) (Love you honey, really do, but I do need a break . . . .)
But what you care about is the attacks that the Sunday Times has been talking about for the last couple of weeks. I've received incredible volumes of email on this story asking for more details - mostly very supportive - so here goes
I met with the Times in London's Trocadero (while the kids played Virtual Games upstairs in an incredible arcade). I also spoke with them at length while at the top of Le Tour Eiffel, at Euro-Disney (Space Mountain violently pivots you end over end in complete darkness: a definite PG-13 ride), on the Chunnel Train and at Legoland. First, the errors in their reporting that annoy me:
event had *nothing* to do with the alleged attacks as the June 2 article alleged attacks,
financial community. It is a NATO SHAPE security group and most of it is quite Despite the protestations of the Net community, masses of media folks and my own criticisms of their writings, the Sunday Times is sticking by their stories with dedicated vehemence. In some ways they seem confused and chagrined that their reporting is suspect. They really do believe what they are saying. I argued that they gave no names of their sources and they responded that it wasn't  necessary since they used the word 'spokesman' in several places. We have to remain disagreed on that point. If it's a rumor, then say it's a rumor. If it's a well placed source who wants anonymity, say so. If it's a spokesman, name him in writing. As a result, the U.S. media has been calling Kroll Associates and the NSA and the British DTI and so on and getting rebuffed at every turn with firm denials of having ever had conversations of the nature claimed in the Times' articles. According to the media with whom I've spoken, this is a giant red flag. Curiously, though, according to the Times, when they call back the very sources used for the articles in the first place, they too are being met with cold shoulders and 180 degree attitude shifts. Curiouser and curiouser.
The Times swears by the validity of the story, and is putting on additional pressure to those people who they claim are in-the-know and will come out with the real details which could be further corroberated. I will be receiving, hopefully this weekend, (not here yet) an updated article that is being published in the UK on this story. From what I've heard about it so far, it will include some comments from Russian Admiral Pirumov (ret) and others on the In the next couple days: Someone in Basel corroberates the tale.

More on the London Attacks: Part IV
The International Banking Information Technology Forum seemed like an ideal location to get a reading on whether the Times' articles held any water or not. I sent the family to Germany for two days while I spoke and schmoozed and asked some of Europe's and America's top bankers about the articles. (See my last three reports [June 1 - 23, 1996] on the alleged attacks as reported in the (London) Sunday Times
I browsed and wove in and out of this esteemed financial community and asked anyone and everyone in the banking field: "Do you know anything?" "Is any of it true?" "Do you know any victims?" "Was your bank attacked?" "Please, tell me!"
Of course I didn't scream this out to all four hundred of the world's top bankers in the public forum of my keynote speech; rather I asked quietly and discreetly, hoping for a discreet and honest answer. I got lucky and received Both people who did agree to speak about the events in question do *not* want to be identified. They are both in the very senior ranks of European banking and only asked that I do not divulge their companies, their positions, backgrounds or names. They both feel that the *real* story should get out - at least as much as they know - and that the leaks are inherently good for the banking industry. [They do not agree with security by obscurity.] Further, they both told me, at separate times during the two day conference, stories that were nigh on identical  (and I never told either one that I spoke to the other).
The bottom line is they both know about _four_ 'attacks' against financial institutions, although it was unclear as to whether they were all in the UK or not. I am left with the distinct impression at least three of them were. [Not the 40 or more that the Times suggested or that I have heard about since April of 1994.] However, unlike the Times article, there was no question as to the method of attack, and both sources were very clear in the use and the meaning of the word attack. Here is what they said as to how the technical extortion was accomplished. The perpetrator(s) would first place a call to the upper management of the intended victim announcing his/her intention. "We will take down your bank (or financial organization) unless you pay us a lot of money not to." The intended victims each sluffed off the threats. Shortly thereafter (within a day or two) their financial systems would seemingly collapse for no reason at the prescribed time and as promised by the caller. Banking services and/or trading would come to a halt, for about an hour or so, and then the affected systems would come back on line. Backups were ineffective; typical disaster recovery methods, I was told, just didn't work.
Thereafter, a second call would be made to senior executives of the victim firms, and the extortion demands for payment made again. In these cases, electronic payments to Switzerland were made, and the monies were then secreted from their temporary Swiss home within seconds - destined for places unknown or unannounced. No repeat attacks to paying institutions has occurred according to my sources.
I was told unequivocally that all of the four attacks used the same methodology: malicious software was somehow injected into the systems but neither was either forthcoming or knowledgeable about the specifics. They specifically denied that HERF techniques were used. But many questions remained, and I was unsuccessful at getting what I would call good answers to these and more queries:
My questions flowed but both people either didn't know the answers or wouldn't talk. With both of them, there was a clear discomfort as I pushed and prodded for more details. Despite having so many questions still unanswered, I do feel fortunate to have found at least two people who were willing to support at least aspects of the Times' story.
One of the two banking people in Basel went even  further with detail. He/she says the actual dollar figure extorted in these four cases using the software techniques, was L63 Million (UK), which is just about US$100 Million. According to him/her, a lot of meetings have been taking place amongst the banks and financial institutions to deal with the situation but they have agreed and thus made a conscious effort to avoid government and law enforcement.
So, no, none of this fully supports the Times' story, but it does support aspects of it, and aspects of the rumors and stories I've been hearing since April of 1994. No HERF Guns, although another of my contacts who will not let me use much of his/her information yet, swears that the software attack stories are merely obfuscating the higher technology methods.
I certainly don't know all of the facts, but as more people come forward with bits and pieces we may be able to siphon through the maelstrom of noise and rumor and find out what's really been going on.
Back at you as soon as I have something more.

 Historically, civil defense has meant to protect citizenry against hostile
military actions. Today, with the specter of Information Warfare representing
new challenges to late-industrial and information age nation-states, the rules
have radically changed. Societies are rapidly migrating to increased dependance
upon four critical interrelated infrastructures and adequate methods of
protection must be developed:
 	- The Power grid is the basis of most of modern society. With it gone,
not much else happens.  If you think this is just a matter of building more
generators, think again--what happens if the factories that *make* the
generators are taken down, too?  	- The Communications infrastructure: land, sea, air and satellite. 95% military communications go over the public networks, and 100% of all financial
and industrial communications. Is it worth protecting?
 	- The Global Financial structure depends upon the first two
infrastructures, and is perhaps the most vulnerable to theft and denial of
service attack.  99+% of all "wealth" is digital--what happens if it vaporizes?
 	- Transportation systems rely upon the other three. The air traffic
systems require both power and communications to manage the thousands of
airplanes in the sky.  What happens to the thousands of airplanes in the air
if air traffic control across an entire country goes down?
 Without all of these infrastructures properly and reliably functioning, the
private sector and the national security community cannot function. No heat, no
air conditioning, no food distribution, no light, no radio or TV, no Internet.
Are we prepared?  Do we have a a crisis response for the day money as we  know
it vanishes?
 Electronic Civil Defense will soon become a critical component of any nation's
well being while the needs of both the private sector and government converge.
The convergence of military and civilian interests that Mr. Schwartau predicted
two years ago is happening before our eyes. Defensive and commercial postures
have so intertwined as to make them indistinguishable.
 This Fifth International Conference on Information Warfare is an unclassified,
open source forum, and will examine the myriad questions of Electronic Civil
Defense from the US, International and multi-cultural perspectives.
 Our seasoned experts will work with InfoWarCon5 delegates to outline a
framework for the vulnerabilities, threats, risks and solutions for Electronic
Civil Defense.  From this conference participants will be able to draw critical
insights which will improve their own legislative, regulatory, financial, and
operational readiness and security.  Last year's Washington InfoWarCon brought
together over 600 people and was covered by CNN among other major media
organizations. This year key world players in information warfare from the
economic, military, and law enforcement communities of over 30 countries are
expected to participate.    Be prepared for highly interactive sessions with
plenty of audience participation.  Please bring  your opinions and be ready to
discuss them with us all!

(New York, NY):  The Internet had been called the world's largest Enterprise Zone -- a place where small business people and entrepreneurs can compete with corporate giants.  But to make it work, a business must master the ways of the Net -- how to target on-line customers, how to present products and services with style, and how to keep sites and transactions secure.
That's why  Winn Schwartau and Chris Goggans, internet experts with first hand knowledge of both the potential and dangers of the Internet, have created The Complete Internet Business Toolkit ($34.95, Van Nostrand Reinhold, ISBN 0-42-02222-0) -- the first comprehensive manual for setting up, operating and defending a business in Cyberspace.
In The Complete Internet Business Toolkit, two of the digital age's savviest cybernauts offer all the information and tools needed to establish, maintain, expand and protect Net enterprises. This complete resources includes information
on common pitfalls, security measures, and payment methods needed to open up shop on the Internet.
card transactions and use Cybercash, Schwartau and Goggans provide businesses with a step by step approach to creating a secure, functional and user-friendly on-line business.  The Complete Internet Toolkit will:
* Outline how a business can easily expand by taking advantage  of the Internet and its myriad resources.
* Demonstrate how to design a web page that will capture the  attention of cyber-customers.
* Review all of the current major security software for conducting   financial transactions on the Internet.
The Complete Internet Toolkit also includes a bonus CD-ROM with more than 5,000 files. In a matter of minutes, it can download Web browsers, SLIP/PPP drivers, digital cash and encryption programs, graphics and animation viewers, compression utilities, and other key programs for navigating the Internet. THE BOOK CONTAINS CRYPTOGRAPHY TOOLS BANNED OUTSIDE THE U.S.
Far from another dry, reference book, The Complete Internet BusinessToolkit is written in clear and entertaining style and is designed for the small business owner or the individual poised to overcome any challenge in order to stake out their claim in Cyberspace.

INFORMATION WARFARE: CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONIC CIVIL DEFENSE
September 4-5-6, 1996
Crystal Gateway Marriott Hotel
1700 Jeferson Davis Highway
Arlington, VA 22202
August 14, 1996; Carlisle, PA.  International security experts,
including military general officers responsible for C3I, intelligence
and security professionals from government agencies, and corporate
information assurance and security executives will review
state-of-the-art techniques in countermeasures necessary to combat
information warfare attacks against the information infrastructures of
the United States and allied nations.  Leaders from industry,
government and the international scene will also discuss policy options
for defense as well as response to attacks.
Information Warfare is likely to influence both military operations
other than war (OOTW), and the violent peace with which both law
enforcement and corporate security professionals must concern
themselves. Electronic Civil Defense for the 21st Century is the focus
of this conference.
Information Warfare represents a direct threat to governments,
financial and business information systems of corporations and private
businesses, and the personal privacy of ordinary citizens.  Information
Warfare is a relatively low cost method for less- developed
nation-states or underground organizations and trans-national gangs to
acquire technology, along with tactical and strategic economic
information, from more-developed nations, governments,
corporate/business entities, and individuals.  Information Warfare is also a means for terrorists, criminals, or
politically-motivated splinter groups to attack their enemies.  Methods
for launching Information Warfare attacks can be done anonymously and
remotely, circumvent laws and detection, and employ an array of
clandestine electronic and human intelligence techniques.
Electronic Civil Defense is the guiding concept which unites all
aspects of a nation's information infrastructure into a unified
mindset.  It's purpose is to prepare for, and where necessary,
counteract the effects of organized and unorganized attempts on the
part of individuals, terrorist elements, criminal enterprises, or rouge
nations to subvert friendly nations, commercial institutions, and armed
forces through malicious destruction of critical information systems
assets such as banking, medical, or defense-related systems. The conference is sponsored by two internationally known experts: Mr.
Winn Schwartau (author of INFORMATION WARFARE: Chaos on the Electronic
Superhighway); and, Mr. Robert Steele (author of various works which
focus on the common theme of "Smart People, Dumb Nations: Bad
Business"), and by the National Computer Security Association (NCSA),
Carlisle, PA.
