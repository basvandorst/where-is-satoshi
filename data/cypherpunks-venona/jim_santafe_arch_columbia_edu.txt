This is far over-simplified.  Most BSD derived Unices provide the _option_
for single-user mode not to be password protected (depending on whether the
console is marked secure in /etc/ttys).  A few default to this behavior,
but on all it is either a configuration choice or a password is always
required (as it is in USG'ish unices).

Only if the machines you are trapping from were silly enough to turn off

to trap from your display, BTW.

Please back this statement up.  The fact is, contrary to our grand self-image,
America has one of the lowest rates of class mobility in the world.  Just shy
of forty percent of the wealth (in land and capital) in the U.S. is possessed
by one percent of the  population.  This far outstrips, for example, Great Britain, where the top one percent of society holds 18% of the nation's
wealth.  Continuing down the line, the top 20% of the us population hold more
than 80% of the nation's wealth.  [Source New York Times, April 17. 1995, p.1]
_However_, that's not what I came here to talk to you about tonight:
An oversimplification.  Cypherpunks are in favor of people using technology
to take their own privacy into their own hands.  Anything outside the scope
of this issue is an aside.  Cypherpunks tend toward anarchism / libertarianism
as a result of their strong bent toward personal freedom, but this generalization
obscures the fact that cypherpunks is a _pragmatic_ group, addressing issues
of importance to both left-leaning and right-leaning anarchist / libertarian
types.  To split the group on lines of economic principle is to undermine the
value of this shared ground.  Let's face it -- when it comes to privacy, the
US and the world are in a state of crisis right now.  It would be a serious
mistake to let our disagreements on economic policy drive us from the fight
for liberty.

You are confusing the difference between capitalism and socialism with that
between authoritarianism and anarchism.  If you think that money isn't taken
at gunpoint in this society, try not paying taxes for a while...  Or more
subtly and more brutally, try not paying for food and shelter for a while...
Conversely to suggest that all socialist economies rely on state enforcement
contradicts generations of communal life among groups such as the Amish...
A more accurate division, if you are looking for sweeping generalizations,
is to say that all statist systems (and it is immaterial to me whether the
state calls itself a `government', a `collective', or a `corporation')
sustain themselves by theft, while in a free society, a more open system
is possible.
Were a truly free society to exist, you or I could choose our own economic
system, rather than being coerced into whatever system is profitable for
those currently in power.  I tend to believe that a communal existance
under such circumstances would be ideal.  I suspect you would seek for
capitalism.  So be it.  Of course, whether a system such as ours could
survive without the national guard, an army, and a police state to keep the
lower classes in line is another question...
Each year a smaller percentage of the population controls a larger percentage
of the wealth, while the income and holdings of the average citizen drops.
Wealth certainly is being transferred...  In the wrong direction.
I doubt you'll find very many (any?) on cypherpunks who would contest this.
Again, you are confusing the difference between socialism and capitalism
with that between statism and anarchism.
Actually there are plenty of beneficiaries.  Mostly corporate.
You do realize, I assume, that three times as much of your tax money goes
to corporate welfare than to actual welfare...

Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe the Geneva conventions do not apply
to nations acting upon their own citizens...  This showed up in the legal
wrangling over whether the brutality in Bosnia-Herzegovena was part of a
civil war or a war between nations, and hence whether an international
tribunal had authority...

But Tim, you've just hit on the perfect solution!  How 'bout each year the
CPunks lobby for another language to be protected?  When no law can be
passed without being first translated into over 1000 languages, lawmaking
will be impossible, and our work will be done.
Seriously, though, most of the discussion of the Ebonics issue on this list
has been based on a dangerous misconception.  At no point has _anyone_
suggested that courses be taught in Ebonics, that Ebonics be taught as a
language, or that all faculty be fluent in Ebonics.
What _has_ happened is that Ebonics has been added to the list of languages
which some students are coming into the school program speaking better than
they speak English.  Ebonics just goes alongside Spanish, several dialects
of Chinese, and a number of other languages whose native speakers may get
help from the school district in learning English.
I think this approach is foolishness, as it stigmatizes and seperates a
group who are not already cut off from the rest of the community, unlike
speakers of other designated languages.  (Unlike Laotian or Spanish, a
`native speaker' of Ebonics can understand `standard' english).  This is
a far cry from the `mandataed speaking of Ebonics' which CPunks seem so
up in arms about.  No such program exists or has existed.
At any rate, as someone already pointed out, the main reason for the
designation of Ebonics as a language is that it overnight doubled the
number of students whom Oakland can count towards federal matching funds
for ESL...
