Encryption should be the default. Err on the side of caution.

@_subject: PGP BUG/FEATURE: multi-platform keys 
Recently I have received two keys that were unusable without modification (from wonderer and Sameer) because they were not prepared using canonical text. I had to replace all the carriage returns by hand (this is the workaround for mac users who receive PC keys). Why is non-canonical text even an option in pgp? Who would use it except by mistake?
As long as I'm at it, here are some more macPGP2.3 bugs, for those who care. Trying to decrypt a message signed by a key I don't have causes a serious crash requiring reboot. Trying to select cancel in a signature dialogue just raises the same dialogue box instead of cancelling. I'm running on a powerbook 145 under system 7.0.1.

@_subject: Hazard of encrypt to self? 
I always encrypt stuff when I send it to the remailers. I always encrypt to myself along with the remailer, in case I need to look at the message again. But since trying to decrypt a message reveals the id's of the keys that can decrypt it, this reveals information about the sender of the message that wouldn't be available if I only encrypted to the remailer.
A partial solution - I generated a new key pair to use for the encrypt-to-self function (a nice short one). I put some meaningless nonsense in the id, so anyone who observes my message on its way to the remailer will no know it is from
