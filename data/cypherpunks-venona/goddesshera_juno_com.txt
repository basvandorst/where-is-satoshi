I take a certain sad pleasure in reminding people that among my first
posts on this list I warned that cypherpunks had better design a
commercial key recovery system, or one they didn't like would be
forced down their throats.  Attila now spouts my line exactly, Adam is
busy designing (though he still can't bring himself to use the term
'key recovery', being meme-dominated as he is), and Tim nods
approvingly. Good luck, gentlemen -- you should have been doing this a year ago.

You have this wrong.  In fact, NSA *supplies* keys for classified
encryption equipment.  They never told me whether they "escrowed"
copies of the keys they supply -- what do you think?
In fact, it's much more complex.  People with real classified data
don't trust encryption at all, and they only use it if they absolutely
have to.  They, unlike many cypherpunks, remember well that there are
other ways to get information besides running big computers, and if
you have protections against those in place already, crypto doesn't
buy much. But classified data isn't really interesting.  Though by any measure
there are huge amounts of it, it is dwarfed by the amount of
government data that is not classified.  To protect that data
government agencies will use comercial crypto, and "key recovery"
*will* be required in any commercial product purchased by a government
agency.  As use of crypto becomes commonplace business practice, the
government market will be huge, and consequently, commercial products
with key recovery *will* be prevelant.  Any company that doesn't supply it will be relegated to niche markets, and, if legal winds blow the wrong way, eliminated.

Neighbor 1: "Let me give you and example. I see you have a dog house out
back. By that I deduce that you have a dog."
Cypherpunk: "That is right"
Neighbor 1: "The fact that you have a dog, leads me to deduce that you
have a family"
Cypherpunk: "Right again"
