Re. government radiation experiments, radium dial painters, & Marie Curie.
Many of the radium dial painters received _stupendous_ doses.  So, I
surmise, did Marie Curie.
Marie Curie, unlike many of the dial painters, lived to a relatively ripe
old age.  She might done better if she hadn't added the dose of a zillion X-rays to the dose from her internal radium burden.

DRUG DEALERS EXPORT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO EVADE LAWS
ON CURRENCY REPORTING - Wall Street Journal 4/7/94
Washington - Drug smugglers are evading U.S. currency-reporting laws
by shipping billions of dollars out of the country, according to a
report released by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on One of the most reliable methods used by the smugglers, according to
the report, is the U.S. mail.  Over 25 criminal organizations have been found mailing cash through a single, unidentified East Cost
airpor. U.S. Customs officials have been wrangling with the U.S.
Postal Service for almost two years on ways to get at the money by
changing the law so outgoing packages can be randomly inspected. But
the issue remains unresolved. [...]          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The report states that a recent, more agressive search experiment by
Customs, using dogs trained to sniff cash and other methods, more than
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
doubled the amount of cash seized during a five month period. [...]
"At the very least, the report's findings suggest it is time for all law-enforecement agencies to work together to plan and execute a
coordinated, long-range approach to address the money-laundering
problem," concluded Sen. Nunn.  The report was prepared for his
subcommittee by the General Accounting Office.

PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY by Walter S. Mossberg
"Keeping Your Kids Away From Creeps As They Play Online"
(...Talk about striking up electronic friendships online ...)
But there's a dark side to this exciting phenomenon, one that's too rarely understood by computer novices.  Because they
offer instant access to others, and considerable anonymity to
participants, the services make it possible for people - especially computer-literate kids - to find themselves in unpleasant, sexually explicit social situations (Sex-ed sessions led by Joycelyn Elders?)
The online services all have rules banning bad conduct and,
fearing possible government-imposed restrictions, have stepped up the policing of online abuse. But parents could do more to
protect kids from these disturbing situations.  And I've gradually
come to adopt the view, which will be controversial among many online
users (!), that the use of nicknames and other forms of anonymity
must be eliminated or severly curbed to force people online into
at least as much accountability for their words and actions as exists in real social encounters.
(.. More talk about how your kid might [gasp!] download a "hardcore
pornographic photo" [This guy should see the stuff on the newstands
in Amsterdam!]...)
Beyond that, I think it's time now for the services to jettison the
long tradition of allowing members to hide behind "handles" or nicknames.  In general people should conduct themselves online
under their real names, or not at all.  IN THE SAME VEIN, I THINK THE
SERVICES SHOULD DELAY GRANTING NEW MEMBERS ACCESS FOR 24 OR 48 HOURS
...WHILE THEY VERIFY THAT THE APPLICANTS ARE REALLY WHO THEY SAY THEY
ARE ... (emphasis mine). (And some folks thought that Brady-style fascism would only be applied
to "gun-nuts"!  Won't be long before you have to have a license to drive on the information superhighway.)
(Article continues with more of same.  Lambasts AOL. Talks about "the most dangerous forms of communication," etc.)
I didn't comment on NSA threatening Bidzos because dog bites man is
not news. If you annoy the Nazis in power and they can get away with it they will kill you.  BTW: The current _New Republic_ contains a story about an Oxford student being threatened by the Secret Service over a much more trivial matter.

Yeah, I know it's not about crypto but it sure is about privacy ...
1984 COMES ONE DECADE LATE
July 12, 1994
On CBS News tonight, the lead story announced a government plan
to require all of us to carry a national identity card.  This card will contain your picture, a fingerprint, your social security number, and other "electronically encoded" information.
You will be required to present this card to obtain employment
or "receive government services."
CA Governor Pete Wilson and Sen. Alan Simpson were featured explaining how this was a really great idea, necessary to
"stop illegal immigration."
If Americans accept this, as I expect they will, we will
see the following:
Cops doing card-scan roadblocks, ostensibly to find drunks and
A requirement to present your card and have a computer record kept
after every financial transaction over, say, $100.
A requirement to present your card to get medical care.
Adoption of these cards as drivers' licenses.  Just a magnetic / electronic data entry to indicate if you are authorized to drive.
Same thing for professional licenses.
Card-scan to buy guns or ammunition - if you are allowed to buy
them at all.
Card-scan to buy potentially subversive tools, chemicals, books.
Card-scan on entry to or exit from the U.S.  Instant database check to see if you are authorized to enter or leave the U.S. Card-scan on entry to or exit from "special" areas:  an extra
little security check before  you enter places the government
is taking an extra interest in. Mandatory presentation of card to get access to an internet-
attached computer account.
Card-scan at your kids' school.
Linked databases of parents and kids, to correlate child support
payments, vaccination histories, academic performance, truancy, antisocial attitudes, you name it.
I could go on, but why bother?  As an exercise for the reader:
The federal government currently is encouraging states to revoke drivers licenses and professional licenses of "bad" people who use drugs, drive drunk, don't pay child support, etc.  What will happen to you in the future if you displease the state?

Associated Press reports today:  Officials at one the nation's three nuclear weapons laboratories discovered their computers were used to store pornography, the Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday. Computers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory contained more than 1,000 pornographic images, said Chuck Cole, deputy associate director of computing at the lab.
The computers were shut down after an investigation uncovered software piracy on the Internet, a network of thousands of computer networks originally designed to connect computers at universities and government research labs. It is now used by millions of people.  "We are currently tracking over 1,600 pirate sites on the Internet in a joint investigation with the FBI," said Peter Beruk of the Software Publishers Association, which represents major software manufacturers. "It is a very serious and costly problem."  [...]
Some people might consider the second paragraph a nonsequitur to the first. However, if one doesn't think too clearly about things, one

[discussion about basement bomb building deleted]
Well, I wouldn't want to snort the stuff daily, but its toxicity
has been overrated in the popular press.
Epidemiologic studies of workers [even wartime workers with impressive
body burdens/ exposures] in a number of uranium bomb-making centers have found ~ no health effects.
I haven't heard much about Pu-workers.

@_date: 1994-08-25 14:38:43
@_author: Brad Dolan 
@_subject: U & Pu is good for U 
I grant you that "impressive" is not too specific but "body burden" is a common way of referring to the material which is taken into the body and retained.  Typically, most material inhaled or ingested is quickly
exhaled or excreted out of the body.  Some exposure (and dose) accrues
during this time.  If some material remains deposited in the body,
exposure continues.  By the standards of the time, workers during WWII were pretty well
protected.  By our standards, which may be overly conservative, some
WWII-era workers received large doses and/or body burdens.  Because these workers (1) had exposures and (2) were monitored, they are the
group of choice for epidemiological studies.
I would be happy to hold a kilo of unshielded plutonium in my hand.
I would probably think it wise to wash it later.  Pu is an alpha emitter.
Its radiation will not penetrate the dead layer of the skin.
I have held pieces of uranium in my hand.  I'm still here.
I would bet that you could get a lot more effect for your terrorist
dollar with aerosols of any number of other, more commonly available substances (like gasoline).
I don't have ready access to a good library right now to go pull
references but if you follow up on the references to these three
papers, you should find more than you will ever care to read on
the topic:

J.F.; Reyes M.; Voelz, G.L.; Waxweiler, R.J.   Mortality among plutonium and other radiation workers at a plutonium weapons facility.

Cohort Study of Lung Cancer, Ionizing Radiation, and Tobacco Smoking
Among Males at the Hanford Site.  Health Physics, 58:3-11; 1990.
Loosely put, the studies say, "Workers at facility X whose exposures
varied from {small} to {large} showed/did not show increased death rates from {long lists of diseases}."
Well, these studies are about all we have to go on right now.  The
wartime residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki do provide a large set of folks exposed to "radiation intended to do the maximum possible harm" but, darn it, none of them were wearing dosimeters.  People do study these groups, making educated guesses about doses, but it's hard to
draw precise conclusions on that basis.
To draw this off-topic topic to a close, I recommend the following to
help bring the various risks into perspective:

These fingerprints could transmitted digitally to obtain instant identification and "criminal history" information about
the hitchhiker.  Criminal history information would include information from federal, state, and local authorities.
Mr. Martin also observed that, while existing Justice Information
databases are now used only for law-enforcement, firearms licensing, and "national security purposes,"  he envisions that the new database could be expanded in its uses to include "non-criminal justice" Why should I have to provide fingerprint identification on demand to What are the "national security" applications of existing databases?
Imagine all the potential "non-criminal justice" applications for the

  For Immediate Release                January 24, 1995
  TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:
       Pursuant to section 204(b) of the International   Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b) and   section 301 of the National Emergencies Act, 50   U.S.C. 1631, I hereby report that I have exercised my   statutory authority to declare a national emergency   with respect to the grave acts of violence committed   by foreign terrorists that threaten to disrupt the   Middle East peace process and to issue an Executive   order that:
  	    Blocks all property, including bank             deposits, of foreign persons or             organizations designated in the Executive             order or pursuant thereto, which is in the             United States or in the control of United             States persons, including their overseas             branches; and
  	    Prohibits any transaction or dealing by             United States persons in such property,             including the making or receiving of any             contribution of funds, goods, or services             to or for the benefit of such designated             persons.
       I have designated in the Executive order   12 foreign organizations that threaten to use   violence to disrupt the Middle East peace process.  I   have authorized the Secretary of State to designate   additional foreign persons who have committed, or   pose a significant risk of committing, acts of   violence that have the purpose or effect of   disrupting the Middle East peace process, or who   assist in, sponsor, or provide financial, material or   technological support for, or services in support of,   such acts of violence.  Such designations are to be   made in coordination with the Secretary of the   Treasury and the Attorney General.
       The Secretary of the Treasury is further   authorized to designate persons or entities that he   determines, in coordination with the Secretary of   State and the Attorney General, are owned or   controlled by, or acting for or on behalf   of, any of the foreign persons designated under this   order.  The Secretary of the Treasury is also   authorized to issue regulations in exercise of my   authorities under the International Emergency   Economic Powers Act to implement these measures in   consultation with the Secretary of State and the   Attorney General and to coordinate such   implementation with the Federal Bureau of   Investigation.  All Federal agencies are directed to   take actions within their authority to carry out the   provisions of the Executive order.
       I am enclosing a copy of the Executive order   that I have issued.  The order was effective at 12:01   a.m., eastern standard time on January 24, 1995.
       I have authorized these measures in response to   recurrent acts of international terrorism that   threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process.    They include such acts as the bomb attacks in Israel   this past weekend and other recent attacks in Israel,   attacks on government authorities in Egypt, threats   against Palestinian authorities in the autonomous   regions, and the bombing of the Jewish Mutual   Association building in Buenos Aires, as well as the   car bomb at the Israeli Embassy in London.
       Achieving peace between Israel and its neighbors   has long been a principal goal of American foreign   policy.  Resolving this conflict would eliminate a   major source of instability in a part of the world in   which we have critical interests, contribute to the   security and well-being of Israel, and strengthen   important bilateral relationships in the Arab world.
       Attempts to disrupt the Middle East peace   process through terrorism by groups opposed to peace   have threatened and continue to threaten vital   interests of the United States, thus constituting an   unusual and extraordinary threat to the national   security, foreign policy, and economy of the United   States.
       Terrorist groups engaging in such terrorist acts   receive financial and material support for their   efforts from persons in the Middle East and elsewhere   who oppose that process.  Individuals and groups in   the United States, too, have been targets of   fundraising efforts on behalf of terrorist   organizations.
       Fundraising for terrorism and use of the U.S.   banking system for transfers on behalf of such   organizations are inimical to American interests.    Further, failure to take effective action against   similar fundraising and transfers in foreign   countries indicate the need for leadership by the   United States on this subject.  Thus, it is necessary   to provide the tools to combat any financial support   from the United States for such terrorist activities.    The United States will use these actions on our part   to impress on our allies in Europe and elsewhere the   seriousness of the danger of terrorist funding   threatening the Middle East peace process, and to   encourage them to adopt appropriate and effective   measures to cut off terrorist fundraising and the   harboring of terrorist assets in their territories   and by their nationals.
       The measures we are taking demonstrate our   determination to thwart acts of terrorism that   threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process by   attacking any material or financial support for such   acts that may emanate from the United States.

[I've cut out 90% of this.  E-mail me if you want a complete copy -bd]
[...]	     On October 24th, at his speech at Georgetown University on the peace process, Secretary Christopher mentioned our concern about this and said that we are looking at a number of options to address both the funding threat and to strengthen our counterterrorism activities in other ways.  And this executive order and the package of laws are a result of that.
administration has been making to counter terrorism around the world.
The executive order will also support the efforts which we have been making now for a long time to encourage similar efforts by foreign governments to prevent funding from their countries to these terrorist organizations.  By blocking transfers to these terrorist groups and individuals and by freezing accounts, while we are not certain about the volume of funds that we will seize or stop, we know that we are sending a very powerful message to potential donors by criminalizing this activity.
terrorist organizations.  We have a very large body of public and intelligence information which documents terrorist acts by these organizations going way back.  And it also designates 18 individuals who are associated with these groups.  The process provides an opportunity to designate additional groups and additional individuals as we work our way through this.  [...]
afternoon.  The legislation that has been drafted is designed to strengthen our ability not only to deter terrorist acts, but to also punish those who engage in such terrorism.  It is a comprehensive bill that we have compiled.  It is still being worked on.  We will be working closely with the Hill to perfect it, and it has multiple provisions, but I'd like to highlight, at this point, essentially five broad areas, many of which are designed to ensure, among other things, that this country is not used as a base of operations for terrorist acts abroad.
would provide clear federal jurisdiction for any international terrorist act committed in the United States.  As many of you know, this has been a particularly critical point, especially in light of various events in the United States and highlighted the question of the existing scope of federal jurisdiction.
conspiracies in the United States to engage in terrorist acts committed outside the United States.  This is an extension of the Material Support Act and is critical, I think, for ensuring that the United States is not, as I said, used as a launching pad for terrorist attacks anywhere in the world.
provide expedited deportation proceedings for aliens who engage in terrorist activities and to expedite their removal from the United States.  preventing fundraising in the United States in support of international terrorist activities overseas.
investigation of matters involving explosives, and implements recently concluded international convention for ensuring that explosives contain "taggets," if you will, insertion of chemical agents into plastic explosives, which will make them more detectible and facilitate investigation.
are critical.  They're more of a technical nature, and would, in fact, greatly facilitate investigation, prosecution and enhance the range of the sanctions that can be applied.
[SENIOR ADMINISTRATION ASSHO...er...OFFICIAL...]	     	     if you will, to facilitate the investigations. will be certain provisions.
I mean, appreciate that we have a variety of existing, statutorily approved mechanisms.  We are trying to, consistent with constitutional requirements, be able to afford ourselves the widest range of enforcement opportunities.  Now, that is not being designed to, in any way, circumvent or deprive people of constitutional protections.  But on the other hand, to the extent that wire-tap authority would facilitate investigations in this area, yes, we would like authority.  But I'm saying that this is just one opportunity, if you will, for dealing with the problem of fundraising. [...]
the judge's prior approval?
somebody to have a hearing before he's deported, are you going to try to shortcut that?  And, third, what about the right to associate so far as going to a mosque and contributing to a -- you're really touching on constitutional rights, and you know it as well as I do.
your characterization.  No, we're not touching -- obviously, the legislation in this area has to be drafted with tremendous sensitivity to those issues, and I think we have.  We have, in fact, brought to bear great concerns about civil liberties of Americans and non-Americans in this country, and what we have designed, I would suggest to you, you will see is consistent with those constitutional limitations. Constitution is not a suicide pact.  It does permit us to move aggressively in this area consistent with the Constitution to be able to protect ourselves and our vital national security.
suggesting, among other things, is to take existing authority, which now has an articulation of a whole range of offenses, that permits legal wiretapping, and add terrorism to it.  Okay?  connection with terrorism is a methodology consistent with constitutional limitations to enable us to expedite the deportation process, utilizing federal district courts and federal district judges and to have a mechanism -- have a mechanism so that to the extent that we have to rely on classified information --
hearings, procedures consistent with the same procedures utilize din criminal cases to ensure the protection of classified information, consistent with constitutional limitations.  That is what we are proposing.  [...]
help you and State and the rest with regard to intelligence on these various groups that might be funneling money to eventual terrorists?
American intelligence agencies are a full partner in this process, and their work overseas and the work of the FBI here at home is essential to make this work.  And they're anxious to help, and they are helping.
about other federal agencies without naming them, and that's why I asked the question, whether that is the paragraph that brings the CIA into the picture. [...]
innocent, that they're involved in truly humanitarian efforts?  Do they have to sue the federal government to get access to their funds?
procedures -- this has happened obviously much before -- we have a lot of experience in this program.  We have appeal procedures, people would apply to the Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control, and there are appeal mechanisms in place.  There are obviously always judicial avenues, but there are nonjudicial avenues as well -- administrative avenues to work this out.
