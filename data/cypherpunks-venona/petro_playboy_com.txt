noted on Men At Arms, (paraphrasing here) Most people don't really care
about democrazy, Equal Rights, or any of that, they just want tomorrow to
be exactly like today. So, as long as things are Fair to good (or great),
there won't be a lot of people intersted in voting, unless things look like
they are going to make a radical change, which leads us to the 3 big reason:
one canidate and the other (outside of the Natural Law types), and those
canidates who _are_ different (Libertarians, Socialists &etc. ("reform"
types don't count, they really are for making tomorrow just like yesterday
& today, only they ADMIT it for the most part)) either don't get enough
votes to challenge the status quo, or if there is an issue that will
challenge the status quo, the number of voters tends to increase (to
varying degrees).

if most stuff isn't actually stolen, then it is bought with money gained by
theft in your last post on this issue. Before that you were maintaining
that everything on the black market had to be stolen, and in fact this

a black market is more defined in terms of the exchange being illegal
