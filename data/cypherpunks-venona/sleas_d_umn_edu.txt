Where can I get this software?  Looks kinda cool.  BTW...  I like the idea of spurring on some pgp usage.  It's a good idea.  I would not object to having to sign messages.

I clipped the wrong line and made it look like I was replying to a guy who was replying to the original guy.  A public apology is in order, because noone deserves to be associated with the dick who flamed Eric.

@_subject: PGP-ELM???? 
I've successfully downloaded and compiled pgp-elm, but notice no differences between it and the original.  What's the deal???  How do you use it???

@_subject: core dumps with pgp-elm 
Anybody else get this problem??  I've tried all sorts of different things.  Compiles fine, runs fine w/out pgp options, but crashes like a stone when I use them.  Segmentation violation.  That sucks!

@_subject: Re: pgp lib 
Here here!  I agree.  There are those who know, and to merely shut out all the expertise that might be on this mailing list is nonesense.  I think the pgp library approach is very interesting.  It could make pgp almost as common as winsock.  We know that there is vast interest in finding a good front-end for pgp.  The thing is, no one wants to dig around in code that utilizes poor modularity and try to flesh out an API.  Once 3.0 comes out, one could build an app under windows using a PGP v2.x DLL, and a newly made PGP v3 DLL that would handle all kinds of keyfiles, a one step option to convert keyfiles, etc...  I think the idea of writing a PGP DLL while the format will change in v3 of PGP is still feasable.  Just use it again for backwards compatability.  a PGWINP.EXE,
a PGPV2.DLL, and a PGPV3.DLL.  Or whatever.  I've only had experience in UN*X, and maybe I'm oversimplifying everything.  But, then again, what is ever simple when you have the trusty old 'windoze' GPF errors.  I much preferr the unix 'segmentation fault (core dumped)'.  Anyway, I will happily stand corrected on anything I say.  Remember, just an idea!
