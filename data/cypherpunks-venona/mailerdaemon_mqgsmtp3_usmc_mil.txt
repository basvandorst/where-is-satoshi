   The message cannot be delivered because the
   recipient's mailbox contains the maximum number of    messages, as set by the system administrator.  The
   recipient must delete some messages before any
   other messages can be delivered.
    The maximum message limit for a user's mailbox is    10,000.  The default message limit is 1000 messages.     Administrators can set message limits using the    Mailbox  Settings function available in the    Manage User menu  (MUSER).    When a user's mailbox reaches the limit, the    user must delete some of the messages before    the mailbox can accept any more incoming messages.

It also provided anonymity to many people who needed it.  I think that many
people who need anonymity will probably just learn faking mail and news
headers.  Many people just don't want to deal with cpunk remailers.  OTOH, I
agree that this might actually force many people with Penet addresses to learn
about more secure remailers.  In this way, the closing of anon.penet.fi could
be looked upon as a Good Thing.  However, as long as there is no easy way for
Windoze and Mac users to use secure remailers, users will sooner resort to
fake-mailing then learning how to use cpunk remailers.  People that need a
pseudonym address to use on various support groups can get them from other,
equally insecure, remailers.

True.  But it is a seperate program from email clients which means that anyone
wanting to use Private Idaho has to download it, install it, and learn how to
use it in conjunction with one's email program.  Most people who may have a
need for anonymity have probably never heard of PGP or Private Idaho.  I
think that until remailer functions are actually built into the programs that
people use, remailer use will be rare.

I have every right as a citizen of country A to tell politicians of country B
what they should or shouldn't do.  This isn't about American Ideology; it's
about natural rights.  Politicians of country B can refuse to listen to me or
attempt to prevent my corrupt ideas from polluting the minds of its citizens,
but they won't succeed very well with the latter.  Of course, politicians may
be satisfied with making sure that only the most determined citizens will be
able to access information they don't want citizens to access, but as
technology progresses, it will become much more difficult to prevent this
information from spreading to the masses.
Cpunks is certainly not the best place to be discussing free speech.  However,
the link between free speech and the spread of cryptographic technology is too
close to completely overlook.

The only problem is there has to be someway for users to retrieve their mail.
The current nym server approach is to use an encrypted reply block to send a
user new mail.  This way the nym server doesn't know who the user is.  If users
have to actively retrieve their mail, then the feds could install a packet
sniffer on the remailers net link to find out the real email address of an
anonymous user.

The mail server still has to send packets to the user.  A packet sniffer might
not be able to find out the actual contents of the transmission, but it would
be able to find out the host that has made the connection.  If this is combined
with the knowledge of the times that certain user's mailboxes get cleared out,
it would be possible to find out which nyms belong to which people.  The
current nym servers that automatically forward mail do not have this problem.
