While I'm all for having clear disclaimers, the facts remain:
1)  You can't force people to read.
2)  Even if you could, you can't force people to understand.
Improve the disclaimers, sure. But don't think that this problem is going
to go away because of it.

It did not play out here on the left bank, probably because of the
earthquake in Japan. Maybe tomorrow.

No one seems to have pointed this out, so:
(maybe it's obvious to everyone else)
    IANAL, but it seems to me that if I EMAIL a copy of PGP to, say, Tim
May, that I have just "distributed computer software .... to a computer
network ...accessible to foreign nationals ..." even though it was
"private" e-mail.
   Comments, anyone?   Anyone? Bueller? ;-)
   Betcher ass.

So much for compression software, too. :-(
Pst! Anyone want a copy of gzip? PKZip? Drop*Stuff?

Indeed. Congratulations to Damien, Adam, and all the other people who
contributed cycles to the "Cypherpunks Key Breaking Ring".
    I suspect Netscape will do the minimum so that they will not be held liable.

The correct URL is, of course,

I do not believe that this is true.
Southwest Airlines has "open seating" on all of their flights, where you
board and then sit in any seat that you choose. (IMHO, an annoying policy)
When a flight is (close to) full, and the flight is running late, many
flight attendants will instruct the last few passengers to "sit in any open
seat". I have seen this on Reno Air, American, and United.

Somebody who might be "Jonathon Fletcher"  said:
Well, that's an interesting question.
On one hand, it's a proprietary encryption algorithm, written by a bright
17 year old.
On the other hand, there have been no reported cracks, no "decrypt your
encrypted archives" programs like there are for MS Word, or WordPerfect.
(Maybe it's hard, maybe no one cares.)
[ Late breaking news: "t byfield" reported one; it appears not to work. ]
On the gripping hand, there was no trouble getting export approval.
Many people/companies put encrypted Stuffit archives up for anonymous ftp.
(Beta versions of executables, etc)
How far should you trust it?
That's up to you.

Ted --
Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I wasn't aware of any cracking
program for Stuffit archives. If you know of any others, please let me
I just finished trying this one, though. It doesn't work.
Here's a some background on Stuffit archives:
There have been three different formats for Stuffit files over the past 8
(has it really been 8?) years.
1)   Version 1.5.1. The original
2)   Version 2.0    Short lived. No longer used.
3)   Version 3.0    The Current version. First shipped in 1992 (I think)
The crack described at the above URL does not work for 1.5.1 archives.
It also does not work for 3.0 archives.
I don't have any 2.0 archives handy, but I will test them in the morning.
It is possible that the cracking technique described at the above URL will
work for 2.0 archives. However, none of Aladdin's shipping software will
generate 2.0 archives, and Aladdin supplies a (free) converter from 1.5.1
and 2.0 archives to 3.0 archives. (They get smaller when converted, too!)
