My memory is a bit foggy on this one, but didn't the gov't ask Netscape (and others?) to stop producing programs with the hooks
for strong encryption in them, in spite of the fact that they did _not_ provide that strong encryption?  It was pretty weird
at the time, and hard to believe, but the discussions it generated then should be in the archives somewhere.
On the other hand, the political climate wrt ITAR is changing,
so you may not have to go to such lengths in the near future.
