@_subject: Anguilla story... 
Can someone please tell me the origin of this whole Anguilla story
that's been going around a lot for the past few days... I just
got onto the list two days ago, and I didn't catch the beginning
of it... thanks,

@_subject: PGP... 
I'm confused.... if you don't want people to be able to read your
email, you code it with PGP or other encoders... but why give away
your key on your website to everyone? That makes your email readable
to everyone... doesn't it? Oh well... I hope someone can explain this
to me...

@_subject: Changing the headers 
Can someone please tell me how you can change the From: header
in the email? I know it's possible... my computer teacher used
to do it all the time... but how? (unfortunatelly his explanation
was to hard to comprehend for me at the time). Thanks a lot...
And in case it helps... I'm using a VAX.. regular text account.
If it makes any difference. Doesn't it have something to do woth
getting into the mail port?
