@_author: where sombody else can get to the keys 
@_subject: Re: FAX Encryption Software 
Also no worries about security - if DOC says you can have it, you can bet
that NSA has seen to it that it is cryptographically weak, or else uses a
key escrow system (where sombody else can get to the keys), and as insecure
as any other non-published method.  For all we know, they may be using a
cereal box decoder ring set up.
