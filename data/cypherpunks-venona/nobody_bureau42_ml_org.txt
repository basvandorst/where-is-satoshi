the national craze of public betel-nut chewing, which he said was
responsible for mouth cancer, slimy sidewalks when they are spit
out, and immorality, in that they are mostly sold by young,

routinely kidnap tourists and hold them for days, though treating
them well, regaling them with propaganda, and ultimately offering
them to the government in exchange for political concessions, such
as new road construction.  Said the speaker of the Yemen

@_subject: Re: Secure phone 
Speaking from a practical standpoint, since I have been the target of
a variety of electronic surveillance for over a quarter of a century,
the Man-in-the-Middle rarely operates so well that there are not a
number of small anomalies that one cannot spot in the quality and/or
flow of the service they are receiving. On the other hand, they rarely
screw up so badly as to make it glaringly obvious what they are doing.
The main thing, when one has reason to believe that quality or technical
problems may be the result of MITM, is to take subtle actions such as
the one suggested above, in order to force the MITM to adjust on-the-fly
to situations that you create in order to monitor the monitor.
  e.g. - "Call me in 5 minutes at 555-PAY-PHONE for the secret code."
    If you already have a shill using that pay phone to monitor sudden
  anomalies in the function, fine, but it is ususally sufficient to
  take a call at the phone in five minutes, and the results of a quick
  patch will be noticeable.
     - "Do you have a radio playing, or something?"
    Hi-tech MITMs use a white-noise system designed to provide a cover
  for noise from their equipment, and a statement such as the above will
  invariably cause them to adjust it, usually resulting in a greater
  clarity or greater fuzziness on the line.
  Similar analysis of one's email, particularly if you have several
recipients who can send you full feedback on timing/routing, etc., can
reveal consistent differences between letters to your mom, and your
death threats against the King (as well as letter to your mom which
contain death threats against the King).
  Bottom line: If you are sending something worthy of being monitored,
then your actions and methodologies should reflect the belief that
you *are* being monitored.

That was the sound of me eating crow.
Although I am a closet reader of the True Story of the Internet series
I am generally perturbed by the many of the inane Truthmonger posts to
the list. I had decided several days ago to make a small apology to
Truthmonger for some of my more emotional attacks on him (or her) but
I put it off and put it off. I decided not to put it off after reading
the following:
That is _exactly_ what I thought when I read Randalls whining post
about how Truthmongers rudeness might necessitate Randall instituting
security and identity procedures that would enable others to verify
whether a digitally signed message was indeed from himself. When I saw
Tokoyo Rose echoing my thoughts then I thought I should take the trouble
to point out what I myself learned from Truthmonger. [Although I am not
certain if it is the same one.]
I made the mistake of informing several people that the exercise that
was suggested in Epiloge 5? of Infowar was bullshit but when I tried
it it spit out my secret key like a hot damn much to my surprise.
So I owe Truthmonger an apology but it will not be a public one.
[Very few of you would know me anyway since I am mostly a list lurker.]
The reason I will not make a public apology is because I also had
PGP spit out the secret keys of my boss and coworkers. Although I am
not a bad person in general possession of these keys is making me
begin to think like Truthmonger. I will probably just test whether
I can indeed password break them and use them to decipher a few
files and then erase my copy of them. [Maybe.]
[Maybe I should make my .sig line "Beware of Truthmonger inside!"]
I did a search for the post that Tokoyo Rose talked about Truthmongers
nephew adding things to Truthmongers email and found:
After looking at other posts that have Truthmangler in them instead
of Truthmonger I think that it might be a sign that the nephew is
messing with them since they seem to have things inserted in them
which appear to come more from a childs mind than Truthmongers.
[If that is possible.] (;>)
I would be interested in finding out if other people have been able to get secret keys using the method described in the Infowar book.
We are using PGP 2.6.3i. I wonder about other versions.

@_subject: Clinton's Bigger Gun Ban 
This is the intro from:                    THE BIGGER CLINTON GUN BAN
     As reported in Wednesday's Special FAX Alert, the Clinton-
Gore Administration is planning to issue a directive to ban
certain types of foreign-made firearms from coming into this
country. We believe the White House will move to stop all
commerce in certain semi-automatic firearms that conform in every
way to the legal requirements set forth in both the Clinton Gun
Ban of 1994 and the 1989 import ban. Sources also suggest that
the directive will order the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and
Firearms to convene a study group to further narrow the scope of
firearms that qualify for importation under the "sporting
purposes" test. Given past action, a ban on all imported handguns
is not unlikely.
     In response to this directive, Congressman Bob Barr (R-Ga.)
held a press conference on Capitol Hill today with NRA Executive
Vice President Wayne LaPierre, NRA-ILA Executive Director Tanya
K. Metaksa, and other pro-Second Amendment congressmen,
including, Jim Barcia (D-Mich.), Pete Sessions (R-Tex.), Virgil
Goode (D-Va.), and Wes Watkins (R-Okla.)  "The Clinton
Administration is introducing the Bigger Clinton Gun Ban of 1998
- still another prohibition that bans more guns and shows more
hypocrisy than ever before," emphasized Mrs. Metaksa. She added,
"From the White House to Handgun Control, Inc., every gun ban
advocate in America is busy confirming everything NRA has ever
said about the 1994 gun ban." Basically, that it's an ineffective
cosmetic ban and that Clinton's efforts to ban guns in 1994 was
only a precursor to bigger, more restrictive bans.  All NRA
members are encouraged to contact your U.S. Representative at
(202)224-3121, to urge him to oppose the President's attempt to
ban more semi-automatic firearms -- semi-autos that his 1994 ban
previously ok'd!  In the meantime, NRA-ILA will continue to
update our members as we learn more about Clinton's latest attack
on America's law-abiding gun owners.

NSA, Crypto AG, and the Iraq-Iran Conflict
                    by J. Orlin Grabbe
the U.S. regularly provided Iraq's Saddam Hussein with top-secret communication intercepts by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).  Consider the evidence.
public relations firm of Hill & Knowlton ten million dollars to drum up American war fever against the evil dictator Hussein, it brought about the end of a long legacy of cooperation between the U.S. and Iraq.  Hill & Knowlton resurrected the World War I propaganda story about German soldiers roasting Belgian babies on bayonets, updated in the form of a confidential witness (actually the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the U.S.) who told Congress a tearful story of Iraqi soldiers taking Kuwaiti babies out of incubators and leaving them on the cold floor to die.  President George Bush then repeated this fabricated tale in speeches ten times over the next three days.
events is that, until then, Hussein had operated largely with U.S. approval.  This cooperation had spanned three successive administrations, starting with Jimmy Carter.  As noted by John R. MacArthur, "From 1980 to 1988, Hussein had shouldered the burden of killing about 150,000 Iranians, in addition to at least thirteen thousand of his own citizens, including several thousand unarmed Kurdish civilians, and in the process won the admiration and support of elements of three successive U.S. Administrations" [1].
good military intelligence.  The role of NSA in the conflict is an open secret in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.  Only in this country has there been a relative news blackout, despite the fact that it was the U.S. administration that let the crypto cat out of the bag.  world on national television that the United States was reading Libyan communications.  This admission was part of a speech justifying the retaliatory bombing of Libya for its alleged involvement in the La Belle discotheque bombing in Berlin's Schoeneberg district, where two U.S. soldiers and a Turkish woman were killed, and 200 others injured. Reagan wasn't talking about American monitoring of Libyan news broadcasts. Rather, his "direct, precise, and undeniable proof"  referred to secret (encrypted) diplomatic communication between Tripoli and the Libyan embassy in East Berlin.
demonstration that it was also reading secret Iranian communications.  As reported in Switzerland's Neue Z^Árcher Zeitung,  the U.S. provided the contents of encrypted Iranian messages to France to assist in the conviction of Ali Vakili Rad and Massoud Hendi for the stabbing death in the Paris suburb of Suresnes of the former Iranian prime minister Shahpour Bakhtiar and his personal secretary Katibeh Fallouch. [2]
had both purchased cryptographic communication equipment from the Swiss firm Crypto AG. Crypto AG was founded in 1952 by the (Russian-born) Swedish cryptographer Boris Hagelin who located his company in  Zug.  Boris had created the "Hagelin-machine", a encryption device similar to the German "Enigma".  The Hagelin machine was used on the side of the Allies in World War II.
Switzerland was a neutral country. So Crypto AG's enciphering devices for voice communication and digital data networks were popular, and customers came from 130 countries. These included the Vatican, as well the governments of Iraq, Iran, and Libya.  Such countries were naturally skeptical of cryptographic devices sold in many NATO countries, so turned to relatively neutral Switzerland for communication security.
the leaks, when it arrested Hans Buehler, a top salesman for Crypto AG, in Teheran on March 18, 1992.  During his nine and a half months of solitary confinement in Evin prison in Teheran, Buehler was questioned again and again whether he had leaked Teheran's codes or Libya's keys to Western powers.  Luckily Buehler didn't know anything.  He in fact believed in his own sales pitch that Crypto AG was a neutral company and its equipment was the best.  They were Swiss, after all.  [3]
Buehler's release in January 1993, then promptly fired him once they had reassured themselves that he hadn't revealed anything important under interrogation, and because Buehler had begun to ask some embarrassing questions. Then reports appeared on Swiss television, Swiss Radio International, all the major Swiss papers, and in German magazines like Der Spiegel.  Had Crypto AG's equipment been spiked by Western intelligence services? the media wanted to know. The answer was Yes [4].
AG to a company in Liechtenstein, and from there back to a trust company in Munich. A witness appearing on Swiss television explained the real owner was the German government--the Federal Estates Administration. [5]
shares of Crypto AG were at one time owned by Eugen Freiberger, who resided in Munich and was head of the Crypto AG managing board in 1982. Another German, Josef Bauer, an authorized tax agent of the Muenchner Treuhandgesellschaft KPMG, and who was elected to the managing board in 1970, stated that his mandate had come from the German company Siemens.  Other members of Crypto AG's management had also worked at Siemens. Was the German secret service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), hiding behind the Siemens' connection?
October 1970, a secret meeting of the BND had discussed how the Swiss company Graettner could be guided into closer cooperation with Crypto AG, or could even merged with it. The BND additionally considered how "the Swedish company Ericsson could be influenced through Siemens to terminate its own cryptographic business." [6]
had to coordinate his developments with "people from Bad Godesberg". This was the location of the "central office for encryption affairs" of the BND, and the service instructed Crypto AG what algorithms to use to create the codes.  The employee also remembers an American "watcher", who strongly demanded the use of certain encryption methods.
often. A memorandum of  a secret workshop at Crypto AG in August 1975, where a new prototype of an encryption device was demonstrated, mentions the participation of Nora L. Mackebee, an NSA cryptographer. Motorola engineer Bob Newman says that Mackebee was introduced to him as a "consultant".  Motorola cooperated with Crypto AG in the seventies in developing a new generation of electronic encryption machines.   The Americans "knew Zug very well and gave travel tips to the Motorola people for the visit at Crypto AG," Newman told Der Spiegel.
AG enciphering process, developed in cooperation with the NSA and the German company Siemans, involved secretly embedding the decryption key in the cipher text.  Those who knew where to look could monitor the encrypted communication, then extract the decryption key that was also part of the transmission, and recover the plain text message.  Decryption of a message by a knowledgeable third party was not any more difficult that it was for the intended receiver.  (More than one method was used.  Sometimes the algorithm was simply deficient, with built-in exploitable weaknesses.)
reports are ""pure invention".
Hussein exactly?  Answers to this question are currently being sought in a lawsuit against NSA in New Mexico, which has asked to see "all Iranian messages and translations between January 1, 1980 and June 10, 1996". intelligence to someone like Saddam Hussein brings up other questions.  Which dictator is the U.S. passing top secret messages to currently?  Jiang Zemin?  Boris Yeltsin?  NSA largess if he returns to the mass slaughter of Iranians?  What exactly is the purpose of NSA anyway?

@_subject: PGP compatibility 
Let me guess, Lucky, you're using Windows, right? If I was a Windows user
exclusively I probably wouldn't give a damn either. Robert's version is
compatable because he's gone to strides to *make* it compatable. Most users
haven't done this.
PGP Inc. has taken a *multi-platform* *network-wide* system and broken it.
They released a Windows version months ago completely severing lines of
communication between 5.0 and 2.x users. Finally, after months, they get around to releasing a UNIX version so that
everybody else can use PGP 5.x. Of course the damned thing *still* isn't
stable, *still* has a timebomb in it, and *still* has the command line
broken. PGP Inc. recommends that people report bugs, get new versions, etc.
at  but as was covered in detail in another posting that
site is a pretty much disabled (or incomplete if you want to think of it
that way).
Microsoft Word is something completely different. We aren't distributing
Word 7.0 documents all over the Internet as a standard communications
When I encrypt a message to you using PGP 2.6, I'm using a version of a
program which is released for certain platforms. When I encrypt a message to
you using PGP 5.0 I'm using a version which is released for certain
platforms, but not all the platforms 2.x was available on. 5.x produces
messages which are incompatable with 2.x. As a result 2.x users, which
includes the UNIX community (which, last I checked, was rather large), are excluded from the message traffic the Windows users are sending
around. Of course I'm talking about signatures and sometimes encryption, but, again, last I checked that was a major reason to use PGP in the first Then again, given the quality of the average Window user's message traffic
on the network today maybe that isn't such a great loss.
It should be worthy of note that I'd be using one of the betas for 5.x right
now if the PGP folks hadn't purposefully broken every script known to man. I
can comment out the timebomb for the expired (i.e. broken in yet another
way) versions they're releasing, or at least were as of last week.
Let's redefine SMTP, NNTP, FTP, and HTTP so that they looks nothing like what currently exists, install it on major providers, and write a set of UNIX clients. When Windows and Mac users complain about this we can all stand up proudly and proclaim that they'll just have to wait a few months for somebody to write the software which will allow them to again take part, and that their
complaining about this completely idiotic tactic is "FUD". And, of course,
since the SMTP2, NNTP2, HTTP2, and FTP2 protocols are so much better than
their previous versions (that wouldn't be too hard) this is all very smart and
nobody should mind.
If PGP Inc. had released a sane UNIX version along with their Mac and
Winblows versions there would be considerably less bitching happening right
now. Hell, they could have released patches for 2.6. Instead they've waited months and still don't have one out which works.

Let's see...if the police with the TV camera in their car get in
a chase with another vehicle, their chances of getting on primetime
TV increase in proportion to the threat posed to all involved,
including innocent bystanders.
So if the 'perp' kills or gets killed, the police officer gets to
sing on 'Star Search'? If the TV camera on the police cruiser gets
a particularly gory shot of the fleeing vehicle splattering a child
in a crosswalk, the cop gets a free dining room set?

Amen! These fools have to start realizing that their best allies in
getting out from under the thumb of big gubmint are the citizens, many
of whom share similar goals in this regard.
  If the corporations try to get too greedy, then they will be no better
option for the citizens than the government currently is, and will have
to fight their war on two fronts, which history has shown to be a very
untenable position.
  We should all encourage ourselves and others to develop as many
communities and inter-related/active communities on the Net as
possible in the near future. The more people who have something to
defend, something to lose, by the loss of freedom on the Net, then
the more who will be ready and willing to raise their voice when
the Fascist Censors/Controllers attempt to steal what does not
belong to them--our speech, privacy, and liberty.
  They are trying to find a few sympathetic/bought judges to make rulings which they can use against those who do not have the funds and the political savy that the Berkeley people do, in order to have
a basis for further injunctions while they apply pressure from other
fronts, as well.
  Freedom of speech for the rich and powerful...sound familiar?
  We have criminals running the government, and pirates running the
corporations. What should our role, as citizens, be?
  I submit that our role in society is to support the organizations
(government, corporate, secular, religious...ad infinitum) which will
serve our best interests in the process of serving their own.
  I further submit that the Globalization of society and government
brings to life the concept that 'no man is an island,' and that it
is no longer possible for us to support discrimination against, or
oppression of, any individual or group of individuals without it
coming back to haunt us much more quickly than in the past.
  The recent initiative by the US, Candada and Mexico, in conjunction
with one another, to seek out 'bad' information/behavior in the health
area on the Internet, is but one example of those who are thinking
locally and acting globally.
  i.e. - If Canucks support legislation which will 'stick it to the
Spics,' they will find themselves freezing to death because of a ban
on jalopenos because of unsupported health claims by the Mexicans that jalapenos are 'good for you.'
  It is imperative that those of us concerned with the development
and regulation of the Internet resist falling into the same sense
of fatalism that has led us to allow the government and corporations
to lead us into narrower and narrower chutes which separate us into
feeding pens designed to turn us into docile consumers of spoon-fed
government and corporate fascism.
  We need to make every attempt to keep the Internet a form of free-
market socialism where 1 Byte == 1 Byte, no matter whether it is a
Swedish byte, a communist byte, an Afro-American byte, a liberal
byte, a gay byte, a Marv Alpert bite, etc.
  The minute that a Holocaust byte becomes of more or less inherent
value or righteousness than an anti-Holocaust byte, then we enter the same quagmire which is suffocating and oppressing the established
forms of government and society.
  We have allowed the mediums of politics and social customs to turn
our world into a place where there is a difference of value in a
symbol of currency, such as a dollar, which is dependent upon whether
it is in a rich man's pocket, a poor man's pocket, a government pocket,
a church pocket, etc.
  We have allowed ourselves to be sucked into the belief that we are
separate individuals, separate nations, and that we can gain by taking
from others. This is true, to a certain extent, as long as we remain
prisoners of local geographical borders, but it will be less so in
a global society.   Who is the enemy?
  The enemy is whoever takes away your freedom. The enemy is whoever
takes away my freedom. The enemy is whoever takes away our neighbor's
freedom, or the freedom of strangers throughout our global community.
  The same applies to privacy, free speech, money, dignity, and a host of other things which are basic to our personal and group liberty.
  Who is our friend and ally?
  It is whoever mirrors the web site which is banned/stolen from us,
whether they agree or disagree with our beliefs and goals. It is the
anonymous remailer operator who replies to the anti-remailer lies
and diatribes I send through their system, rather than blocking them.
It is the person who attacks the organizations that seek to censor
or ban our individual beliefs and opinions, even while attacking
our beliefs and opinions in expressing their own.
  Freedom is our friend. Censorship is our enemy.

Mark Koernke "Mark of Michigan" Arrested Today
by WebToday Staff Writers
November 14, 1997
Mark Koernke (aka "Mark of Michigan") was arrested on Friday, November 14, 1997. A warrant for his arrest was issued on November 7 in Washteneau County for aggravated assault for allegedly beating up process server Roger Gainer while being served with a summons by the defense lawyers of John Stevenson. Stevenson had plead guilty of being an accessory after the fact in the murder last year of William "Bill" Gleason in Hillsdale, Michigan. More charges are expected to be filed against Korernke and other individuals in the ongoing investigation of the Gleason murder which is often referred to as "the Hillsdale murder."
Richard Champion (aka Carl Miller) was arrested two weeks ago for failure to respond to a subpoena but has since bonded out of jail. Bond was set at $22,000.
Bill Gleason was reportedly one of Mark Koernke's bodyguards. Both were members of the U. S. Militia. Neither Koernke nor Gleason were ever members of the Michigan Militia Corps Wolverines (MMCW). The MMCW, headquartered in Muskegon, Michigan and is led by Commander Lynn Jon Van Huizen. It is believed to be the largest militia group in Michigan and perhaps the largest in the U. S. Koernke is a resident of Dexter, Michigan and works for the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He is known for his "American in Peril" video and is a shortwave radio commentator.
This is confirmed as I spoke with John Statdmiller personally 10 minutes ago.
Mark Koernke was arrested a few hours ago. Charges are felony firearms
possession.Local County prosecuter bringing the charges is Donald Ray of the
14th District. His office number is 313 971 0078
Mark is scheduled for arraignment at 2PM Eastern Time

The browser indicates it is trying to contact, which can mean anything

I'm guessing kiwi is Raph's computer in Computer Science and that maybe it is hosed. Maybe Raph has been hosed...     "(WHAP!) Tell us the name of your leader! (WHAP!) Talk! (WHAP!)" Maybe Raph will turn up one of these days writing plaintive notes of contrition. Maybe... oh, never mind.
Oddly, while Raph has a home page at  and at atropos.c2.net/, all the critical roads seem to lead to kiwi, including the mixmaster list. Search engines show precious few references to critical remailer files except in the links that point to the dead host. Is it really this easy to make the whole

Aw, bullshit, Bob! You were wrong when you started this fuckfest
and you're digging yourself deeper and deeper with every post.
There was a time when I thought you had a brain and a modicum of
common sense, but you've thoroughly disabused me of that fantasy.
I once visited your website and thought, "This guy is cool!"
Geez, I'm embarrassed to admit that now.
You've taken Tim's comments out of context and done yeoman work
for the enemy. If (or when) they ever find an excuse to bother
him, they won't be showing _his_ posts to the jury -- they'll
be showing _yours_, you clueless fuckwit. This is the age of "social convictions," in case you haven't noticed because you've been living in an e-cave. They don't prove cases anymore; they show that you're a "bad actor." It's all done with PR, whether totally in the press or partly in a courtroom. The first piece of paper the feds send out when they attack someone is a press release. The victim often first learns he's in trouble when the reporters call.
Maybe you're too young, child. The world is not figuring things
out fast enough or on a large enough scale to offset the
accelerating advance of the state. Tim has been around long
enough to have figured out that the statists have pissed away
his entire lifetime making him wait for things to get "figured
out." You have no respect for your elders, who have gotten bored over more things than you have yet learned. You should be spanked and made to sit in the corner until you can behave.
Tell that to the Athenians and hundreds if not thousands of groups since who have been surprised when their worlds collapsed. Tell that to the Austrians and Germans of the
1920's. Tell that to the piles of bones in Cambodia. You
suffer from the subjectivity of youth. You think that the
universe revolves around your time and space and that those
are unique in human experience. You're wrong. The times into
which we are headed have every promise of being the very most
"interesting" in human history. I for one won't feel a bit
compensated by your future whines that you "wuz wrong!"
If you had two brain cells to rub together you would have
taken your lumps in Tim's first brushoff and shut up. He's
got a right to his position and you haven't got shit. What
you will have is a place in someone's black book if it turns
out that your characterizations of Tim's posts ever turn out
to be fuel for the enemy's meatgrinder. Ignorance, even stupidity, are pardonable if not too tightly connected to
the motor mouth. You should consider that the damage you may
do could far exceed the value of whatever pride it is that
impels you to continue to articulate the government's ideal
(and fatuous) arguments in this matter.
Only a complete fool would be that sure.
Really, if you just stopped and thought about it a moment,
there are only a very few regular posters to the list. All
of them could be hauled off without making a ripple. We are meanwhile playing war footsie with Iraq after having spent
the better part of five years doing Clinton's best to disable, demoralize, cripple, and mismanage the military.
We're a few press conferences away from being in way over
our heads with a left-wing android in charge. Is this your
picture of stable times and a secure Constitution? Do you
seriously doubt that there are people in the Administration,
at least in the bureaucracy, who wouldn't like to be able to
make a few gratuitous PR linkages in a national emergency and have an excuse to get rid of the C-P annoyance once and for all? Did you miss entirely the personal destruction
wreaked on Jim Bell _without_ a national emergency? Would you
be utterly shocked to learn some day soon that you, too, have
ordered odd chemicals from someplace or other over the last
few years? Hey! It could _happen_!
No, Grasshopper, it is just a _little_ paranoid to suggest
that it might be a possibility. You're putting words in Tim's mouth again. You can probably assume that if Tim
were really convinced that that were going to happen, they
would find only an inflatable Tim sitting in front of a
'puter relaying email through an indirect dial link. Or
something like that. He's just concerned. I'm concerned. Anyone with a brain above room temperature is concerned.
Ugly things are in the wind.
Why, Grasshopper! He's done no such thing and you well know it.
You are the one making such characterizations (as if any of
us needed that). Had I the time and the interest, I would
check what archives there are to see if you did the same
favor for Jim Bell.  Fuckwit!
Well, there's more, but your time's up. See you in the camps.

@_subject: Free Crime! (Take One...) / Re: Jim Bell's Sentencing Delayed 
One way of looking at it is that a greater crime than he committed
has already been 'paid for'. Whatever they add to his sentence will
serve to increase the value of the 'gift certificate' Bell is buying
for some lucky CypherPunk for Christmas.
Since much of the authority of society revolves around guilt/shame,
then a crime already paid for allows us to committ it without guilt.
e.g. - Tim McVeigh
I am tired of the whiners who cry out for the public hanging of
every person deemed guilty by the justice system of 12 million
jurors whipped into an emotional frenzy by the press and the
government spin doctors, and who then bitch and moan when some
servant of the Tao, such as Terrible Timmy, exercises the other
side of the two-edged sword.
Since McVeigh was a dead-duck anyway, it is a shame that he didn't
just stand up in front of the jury with a history book and a
calculator, do some figuring, and say, "By my calculations, not
only is my crime already paid for, but 'we the people' still have
plenty of 'credit' left on the account."

Here is the piece about the CNN show transposed to another,
accurately analagous context to show the utter idiocy of what's

actually had to transpose to do this. All I changed were the occurrences of "online," "software," and "Surf."  I modified a couple of other related words just to comport with the shift of the metaphor from online to streets/public places.  Many paragraphs remain unaltered because they contain none of the key words.
For credible transposition, imagine that the "tools" they're
discussing are something like a headset, blinders, and body armor
that kids can be made to wear while in public to protect them from
the realities of public places. Ask yourself how different that
would be from the assinine blocking software being discussed in the
original interview, and how intelligent is it to presume to think
one can mold all public places to be as safe and comfy as the family
living room. These people must be on very strong drugs.
This is also an indirect statement on the utter superficiality of present day "news" coverage. The original interview _says_ virtually nothing, communicates virtually no facts. It is really just an emotional rallying and back-patting with little discernable in the way of contextual detail.

Does anyone care?  Is the whole c-p list a giant MITM being run against a very few of us who are the only human participants?
Oh dear!  I just realized that c-p _could_ be subject to an interesting MITM attack:  By subtlely modifiying the text of c-p messages arriving at certain key recipients, the bad guys could then correlate the quoted text in resulting anonymous replies to the list with individuals, and
could probably also shave a layer or two off the remailer chains through which those messages were sent.  The determination of individual's usage patterns of remailers would also benefit from this, and the info would go into a growing database which could then be used at some point down the road to nail key people and remove them as irritants and agitators.
Isn't it odd that many key contributors to the list coincidentally live near nondescript neighborhood houses that bristle with
antennae and are regularly visited by black helicopters and large unmarked vans?  No, I didn't think so either.  That's probably an unrelated operation.

With so many filters for spam and high list noise it's difficult to keep track, but I'm accustomed to seeing more than 10 messages a day from this list.

I've seen brief mention of this before, but have never seen any details on the list. Aside from Jim Choate questioning
my arithmetic or attention span, would anyone be kind enough
to provide pointers to information about incidents of c-p
list members having received unsolicited email from .gov?
Declan, did you catch a whiff of this when it happened? I would think everyone's alarm bells would have gone off and people would have been intensely interested in the messages themselves, particularly the headers.

It's a real pity Choate never tried reading before spewing.
It would appear poor Jim doesn't have a clear idea of
Hayek, and has difficulty distinguishing between any of the
several voices used, and in filling in thin context. This
is another case like Jim's confusion over which "Gates" Tim
was referring to in a recent post.
Well, ego anyway.
Sounds like you should do some reading before you mouth off.
Perhaps you should have stuck with programming and kept away
from political commentary. Scratch that -- programming
requires a high degree of ability to deal with reality as
it is, not as one mistakenly sees it.
Your assignment is to read The Road to Serfdom and submit a
5,000 word essay to the c-p list on the subject of Hayek,
the brain-dead drone. Following that you will be allowed to
submit a 20,000 word essay on Jim Choate, the often-clueless
and illiterate half-wit motor mouth.

@_subject: A gauntlet thrown down by PC-Magic? 
What fucking challenge? Is he or are you so dimwitted as to
think that people have nothing better to do than provide
Scott and his cretinous friends with a first-hand education?
A "challenge" would be something like:     "PC-Magic has encrypted a [file/message/whatever]     containing ecash in the amount of $50,000, has     deposited with [an arm's-length third party] the     original text, the encrypted [file/message/whatever],     the software that decrypts it and the [password or     passphrase], and hereby agrees to leave the ecash
    prize current and unrepudiated until [deadline date],
    after which we will re-deposit the ecash and instruct
    the [third party] to reveal the message and demonstrate
    its decryption as a proof that the challenge was     genuine."
The prize amount would have to be relatively high since these people have not published technical information and no one has any real interest in investing time and money to demonstrate that people who appear to be idiots are, in fact, idiots. The $10K and lower challenges that have been issued in the past have mostly come from known entities with published algorithms.
Scott's characterization, "the 'crap' we get from supposed crypto experts." is indicative that he really didn't read and understand much of the criticism. It is typical of the ignorant who have embarked on a flawed course to become annoyed at well-founded criticism and to belittle their "...no one has come close to breaking our method" is indicative only of the lack of motivation on the part of qualified cryptanalysts, most of whom have much better things to do. It is the responsibility of the advocate of a cryptographic technique to raise the level of interest in testing it sufficiently high that it will in fact be thoroughly tested. To claim that a technique has never been compromised is to claim nothing at all. I have a message I encrypted when I was 16 that no one has yet cracked. I could challenge PC-Magic to crack it. If they were sufficiently introspective to be able to examine their reasons for ignoring my "challenge" they would understand why theirs is not a challenge. OTOH if they had that many brain cells to rub together they would already have understood the logic of the criticisms they so glibly dismiss.
Perhaps a more satisfying exercise would be if PC-Magic were to encrypt a ton of the worst child pornography, hate literature and conspiratorial assassination plans imaginable, then present themselves and the computer containing the encrypted goodies to the office of the Bavarian prosecutor.

Re: FC: ADL and CyberPatrol
Much as I agree in principle with counteracting mindless
prejudice such as that directed against Jews, and despite
the fact that I grew up among Jews and studied with my
best friend in grade school when he took his religious
lessons, the ADL has zero credibility with me for a very
good reason: I had a role in an organization that, while it was populated with a good many bible-thumping Christians, took great care not to encourage, promote or give a platform to voices of
unreason. The nature of the organization was political and
in no way dealt with religious issues or issues which would
find people dividing along any religious or ethnic line.
Nonetheless, I was stunned one day to read mention of our organization characterized as "anti-semitic" by the ADL in a national publication. To have provided such erroneous information to the author of the article the ADL either had
to have been grossly negligent in its gathering and analysis
of facts or had to be pursuing other agenda in using the clout of its pronouncements. I rather think it may have been the latter (the organization was Constitutional and anti-income tax, while the ADL probably harbors more than
its share of socialists who bristle at any challenge to the
taxing authority of the state).
My qualification to judge the ADL's deficiency in this matter was absolute. I had personally written and/or reviewed
every piece of literature the organization had published, including newsletters, from its inception. There was no
propagation of policy or position with which I was not
personally acquainted, and nowhere had the organization ever
published anything that could even vaguely be interpreted
as anti-semitic.
So I regard the ADL with extreme suspicion, not on the
vaporous basis of pre-judgement or hearsay but on the solid
basis of having been visited with unwarranted and groundless personal damage at their hands, not unlike the small club
of people who know the treachery of Sixty Minutes for what it is by personal experience.
The ADL does its proclaimed purpose a radical disservice by
verging sharply from the straight and narrow that is
mandatory in any holier-than-thou endeavor. I would lay down
my life for any of a number of my Jewish friends, but I wouldn't give the ADL the time of day even if the Apocalypse were upon us.

@_subject: Chodorov (was Freedom Forum) 
Required reading for revolutionaries of the digital era,
from a very bright light of the 1950's and one who
did much to shape the movement that became libertarianism.
Following are two excerpts, the first from commentary on
a current Web page, the second from Chodorov's 1954 book.
"The Sixteenth Amendment passed because the country thought only the rich would pay. In 1910 William Shelton, a Georgian, wrote that Southerners favored ratification 'because none of us here have $4,000 incomes, and somebody else will have to pay the tax.' This view proved shortsighted. As Frank Chodorov noted in The Income Tax: Root of All Evil: 'At first it was the incomes of corporations, then of rich citizens, then of well-provided
widows and opulent workers, and finally the wealth of housemaids and the tips of waitresses. This is all in line with the ability-to-pay doctrine. The poor, simply because there are more of them, have more ability to pay than the     - "Author's Introduction:  Argument
"Tradition has a way of hanging on even after it is, for all practical purposes, dead. We in this country still use individualistic terms -- as, for instance, the rights of man -- when, as a matter of fact, we think and behave in the framework of collectivistic doctrine. We support and advocate such practices as farm-support prices, social security, government housing, socialized medicine, conscription, and all sorts of ideas that stem from the
thesis that man has no rights except those given him by
"Despite this growing tendency to look to political power
as the source of material betterment and as the guide to
our personal destinies, we still talk of limited government,
states' rights, checks and balances, and of the personal
virtues of thrift, industry, and initiative. Thanks to our
literature, the tradition hangs on even though it has lost
"But there are many Americans to whom the new trend is
distasteful, partly because they are traditionalists, partly
because they find it personally unpleasant, partly because
reason tells that it must lead to the complete subjugation
of the individual, as in Nazi Germany or Communits Russia,
and they don't like the prospect. It is for these Americans
that this book is written. They are the "elite" -- the
questing spirits who in all times effect revolutionary
changes. For a revolution now is certainly in order. And
by "revolution" I mean the return to the people of that
sovereignty which our tradition assumes them to have. I mean
the return to them of the power which government has confiscated by way of the Sixteenth Amendment.
"When you examine any species of government intervention
you find that it is made possible by revenues. A government
is as strong as its income. Contrariwise, the independence
of the people is in direct proportion to the amount of their wealth that they can enjoy. We cannot restore traditional American freedom unless we limit the government's power to tax. No tinkering with this, or that, or the other law will stop the trend toward socialism. We must repeal the Sixteenth Amendment."
    - F. C.
"XII. For Freedom's Sake [excerpted]
"Whether there are any mystic forces pushing men along a path from which there is no escape, is a moot question.
But there is no questioning the fact that throughout
history men have regularly made excursions in quest of
freedom, and that every one of these excursions was
identified by its leadership. It is a logical inference
therefore that when men of that stripe appear on the
scene the cause of freedom is not neglected. Perhaps,
after all, the present plight of freedom in America is
due to lack of leadership.
"If, for instance, those who prate about 'free enterprise'
were willing to risk bankruptcy for it, even as the men of
the Declaration risked their necks for independence, the
present drive for the collectivization of capital would
not have such easy going. Assuming that they are fully
aware of the implications of the phrase they mouth, and
are sincere in the protestations, the fact that they are
unwilling to suffer mortification of the flesh disqualifies
them for leadership, and the case for 'free enterprise' is
"The present low estate of freedom in this country must be
laid to lack of the proper leadership -- to men who know
that freedom is and who do not equate it with their own
'standard of living.' Whether or not leadership could have
averted, or can still stop, the trend toward socialism,
may be open to question; that a glorious fight for freedom
might yet enliven the American scene is not. Whether a
fight for freedom will be crowned with success, is less
important than the fight itself, for if nothing comes of
it, the improvement in the spirit of the fighters will be
a gain, and they cannot help but keep alive the values
that will make America a better climate for their offspring
to live in.
"There is no accounting for the emergence of these superior
men, these "sports of nature," who sporadically shape the
course of mankind. They come, as it were, from nowhere, and
nobody has yet conclusively explained their advent. But,
they come. When in her own time and her own pleasure Nature
deems America ready for and worthy of them, she will give
us the men who will make the good fight. It seems reasonable
to assume that their first objective will be -- Repeal of
the Sixteenth Amendment."
