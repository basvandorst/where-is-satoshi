Porn.. by Jeffrey A Nimmo Read the legislation. I have the text of S.1237 in front of me now.
Child pornography is any depiction, including electronic, where:
(A) the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor
engaging in sexually explicit conduct;
(B) such visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in
sexually explicit conduct;
(C) such visual depiction is advertised, promoted, presented, or
distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression that the
material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in
sexually explicit conduct.
Anyone who "knowingly receives or distributes" it in any way over state
lines "including by computer" will be fined and given a 5 to 15 year
vacation at Club Fed.
