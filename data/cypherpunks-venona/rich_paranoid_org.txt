Have your CPU fight for justice in it's spare time!
Some of the folks from the mitnick mailing list have set up an
RC5 team in hopes of generating awareness about Kevin Mitnick's ordeal and
possibly some cash for his defense.
Details are at our site:
The site has more info about Mitnick and the RC5 crack if you're not
familiar, as well as a gallery of graphics & banners you can put on your
own site to show your support.  We hope to have a stats page up soon.
We're registered at both  and  ...

There are some good tools there.
You don't have to have RedHat to use rpm packages -- it will work with
other Linux distributions.  Rpm is available at:

I think Kevin's time in custody shapes up to at least 31 months now.  He
was recently sentenced on a couple of charges, but his time served
exceeds the sentence he was given.  He has been held without bail for
this incredible length of time, yet he has never committed a violent
crime, AFAIK, and never profited financially from his hacking.  In a
hearing a few months back he finally established the fact that he was not
a "fugitive" when he went underground, but had completed the release terms
he was under shortly before.
While I'm not sure I can follow this all to the conclusion that the gov is
using his case to distract people from their attempts to regulate the
Net, I think it is clear they are using him as a warning sign to potential
hackers: Don't believe you have anything like civil liberties, because we
can lock your ass up for years without even having to take you to trial.
There is a pretty quiet majordomo list about Kevin's case at 2600 --
mitnick  Some of us who are concerned about Kevin's case have
been participating in an RC5 team that's meant to hopefully draw attention
to his case.  We're working on RC5-64 now, and people who are interested
in joining can visit the URL below.
The judge in Kevin's case recently set a tentative trail date, for April
of '98, I believe.  That means he'll have been in for over 3 years before
his federal tial begins.  He is facing a 25-count indictment.

I wish.  It drops the P120 I tested it on like a rock, when executed
from a normal user account in Linux.  This does not crash the PPro or PII
