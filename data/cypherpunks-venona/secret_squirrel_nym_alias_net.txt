"HACKTIVISTS" SAY: "THE REVOLUTION WILL BE DIGITIZED"
Two political activists in New York, of cofounders of the Electronic Disturbance Theater, are organizing "virtual sit-ins"
and recruiting programmers to attack the Web sites of persons or
organizations they believe responsible for oppression.  "We see this as a form of electronic civil obedience," says Stefan Wray,
one of the two leaders of this effort. National Information Protection Agency chief Michael Vatis says, "I wouldn't
characterize vandalizing Web sites as cyber-terrorism, but the only responsible assumption we can make is that there's more going on that we don't know about."  Some activists agree with that assessment, but for different reasons;  they think such methods are unproductive because they will antagonize the general public.  (New York Times 31 Oct 98)

MICROSOFT EXECS WORRY ABOUT FREE SOFTWARE MOVEMENT
An internal Microsoft memo written by one of that company's software
engineers indicates that Microsoft is concerned with developing strategies
for competing against free programs that have been gaining popularity with
software developers, such as the operating system Linux.  The memorandum
warns that the usual Microsoft marketing strategy known as FUD (an acronym
for fear, uncertainty, and doubt) won't work against developers of free
software, who are part of the O.S.S. (open-source software) movement that
makes source code readily available to anyone for improvement and testing.
The memo ( says:  "The ability of
the O.S.S. process to collect and harness the collective I.Q. of thousands
of individuals across the Internet is simply amazing.  More importantly,
O.S.S. evangelization scales with the size of the Internet much faster than
our own evangelization efforts appear to scale."  (New York Times 3 Nov 98)

Militiamen Assault Federal Command Post
Shots Exchanged, No Injuries
November 17, 1998
Andrews, NC -- An unknown number of militiamen attacked a federal
command post late last week, exchanging fire with agents.  No injuries
on either side were reported, and the unknown number of militiamen were
said to have fled.  The Rudolph Command Post, in Andrews NC, is the base
from which more than 200 federal agents are conducting a search for Eric
Rudolph, suspected bomber of a number of abortion clinics and of the
1996 Olympics.
    Federal agents say that bullets whizzed by their heads and that one
agent was barely grazed when nearly a dozen shots were fired into their
    Eric Rudolph, 32, has been charged in numerous bombings, including
one that killed a police officer, and has fled into the woods of Western
North Carolina.  The eighty agents that had been assigned to the case,
until recently, when their number was boosted to 200, have been unable
to locate Rudolph.  ANS correspondants on the scene that the local
residents overwhelmingly support Rudolph, and that many have pledged
that they would support and shelter him if they felt it necessary.
    Rudolph is linked to far-right Christian organizations.  ANS's North
Carolina correspondents are not sympathetic to these organizations.

The Chinese government has put 30-year-old Shanghai computer software businessman Lin Hai on trial for "inciting the overthrow of state power" by providing 30,000 e-mail addresses to a U.S. Internet magazine called "Big Reference" published by Chinese dissidents.  Chinese authorities closed the four-hour trial for what it said were "national security" reasons, and "persuaded" one member of Lin's legal team not to attend the trial.  Lin's wife Xu Hong, who was questioned by the police for six hours, has indicated that Lin's lawyer "said he didn't have a very good feeling -- that things won't be good for Lin and he will probably be found guilty."

Last updated: 11:00 P.M. Thursday, December 10th, 1998.                     HIGH SPEED CHASE AND SUSPECT ARREST
                    Cpl. Kevin Grebin/S.D. Highway Patrol: "It was the scanner traffic from his cell
                    phone that the officers picked up that enabled us to capture him."
                    A high speed chase and a cell phone conversation ends with one man in jail...
                    Law enforcement officials from both Iowa and South Dakota chased the man at
                    speeds in excess of 100 miles an hour.
                    He was wanted on a Federal warrant for drug charges.
                    K-S-F-Y's Judeka Drogt and Chief Photographer Lonnie Nichols were there and
                    have the exclusive report.
                    Natural Sound Of Arrest Being Made As It Happened.
                    32-Year old Tracy Fanning was quietly led out of a farm field 6 miles North of
                    Lennox.
                    Natural Sound Of Officers Going Through Suspect's Pockets And Finding
                    Drugs.
                    Officers found methamphetamine and two knives on him.
                    This was the successful ending to a very long night for these officers.
                    It all began in Iowa...
                    That's where Fanning was spotted by the Iowa State Patrol.
                    The chase began after they learned he was named in a Federal drug warrant.
                    He crossed into South Dakota around 11:30 p.m.
                    Fanning dumped his car at a rural home and ran...
                    As Police followed him they had no idea what they were facing.
                    Cpl. Kevin Grebin/S.D. Highway Patrol: "There was some ammo there that we
                    could not find a weapon to so we weren't sure if he had the weapon on him
                    when he took off."
                    For the next 3 and a half hours Police used dogs and spotlights to search for
                    him.
                    That's not all.
                    Fanning was using a cell phone to call a contact...
                    He was hoping to be picked up...
                    Instead it was the Police that were "picking up" his conversation...
                    And his location.
                    Fanning's last phone call led officers to his hiding place.
                    Fanning was taken to the Minnehaha County Jail at 3:30 Thursday morning.
                    LENNOX CHASE FOLLOW-UP
                    Drug crimes, high speed police chases and manhunts are something many folks
                    think happen only in big cities.
                    But as we've shown you exclusively, that's not the case.
                    K-S-F-Y's Brian DeRoy takes us to the site of this morning's manhunt.
                    Betty Vanderwerf/Rural Lennox Resident: "You just don't want to go out in
                    those trees in the daytime at least until somebody else could be caught."
                    Betty Vanderwerf is still shaken about all the police cars near her rural Lennox
                    home.
                    Betty Vanderwerf/Rural Lennox Resident: "It makes you feel like you don't even
                    want to take the dog out for a walk after dark, and you just want to keep your
                    doors locked."
                    Back where police finally caught up with Tracy Fanning...it was only after quite
                    a long search...
                    The suspect was running for a long time including back over in an area near
                    Betty Vanderwerf's house.
                    They located Fanning just behind some trees is where Betty Vanderwerf lives.
                    Betty Vanderwerf/Rural Lennox Resident: "Hopefully you don't think he's a
                    killer out on the run, he's just getting away from authorities for his problem."
                    Things are quiet in downtown Lennox.
                    But the talk in the grocery store is how close the armed suspect was to town.
                    Verg Musch had his doors unlocked Wednesday night.
                    Verg Musch/Lennox Resident: "Grew up in the country and from there into a
                    small town like this, I would imagine most of the people don't."
                    Well, maybe not.
                    Brian DeRoy/Dakota First News: "How many of you lock your doors at night,
                    raise your hands...most of you."
                    Lennox Resident  "We just always do, I don't know, always have."
                    Lennox Resident  "I'm on the highway and I'm just afraid if I'm alone at
                    night."
                    Back outside town, Betty won't be taking country living for granted anymore.
                    Betty Vanderwerf/Rural Lennox Resident: "It just kind of goes to show when
                    you go to bed at night, lock your doors."
                    A reality no matter what your address.
                    Lennox is still a pretty sleepy place.
                    The town has only three full-time Police officers.
So was it really intercepted cell phone traffic on a police scanner, or did they get his location from the cell phone  -0777-- -export-a-crypto-system-sig -RC4-3-lines-PERL
