there is a good accounting of Leuchter's work in "The Execution Protocol", an examination of Missouri's death penalty process.  I can get the ISBN number if anyone is interested.  It was also made into a documentary by Discovery.

@_subject: Nym Server Development.... 
John Fleming, along with a bit of support help from myself, is developing
a nym server that he is intending to release to the public once we are
satisfied with the performance and the state of the code.
At this point and time, John has pushed the code to the point where we
have am experimental nym server operating that is being constantly
refined and features added. Along the same lines, I am presently
working on solid documentation for when the nymserver is ready for
public use, and for the later public release of the code.
John created a mailing list for those interesting in contributing to the
development of his nymserver and as a forum for discussion of nymserver
related issues.  So far, there have been few folks subscribed, and no
answer from those that are presently subscribed to the list.  I find
this rather disappointing.
This is your chance to get involved in developing this server.  There has
been alot of interest expressed in nymservers on this list previously,
as well from other folks that presnetly use the type I and II remailers
that are running today.  Just like the other types of anonymity out
there, a nymserver has many viable reasons for existance.  The lack of
publically available code for such a server, as there is for remailers,
should motivate us to get behind John and his efforts.
To subscribe to the nymserver development & discussion forum, send
a message to majordomo with the line "subscribe nyms
" in the body of the message.  Questions about the
nymserver should be directed to that list so that all can be involved
in the development.
Thanks for your input,

There have been discussions concernign this before both on here
and other mailing lists, such as remailer-operators.  A nym
server is an operation similar to anon.penet.fi, but more secure.  Sameer
has two of these operating now that uses PGP encrypted reply blocks
and such.  [omega.c2.org and alpha.c2.org, both of which use different
operating methods] What John is attempting to do is have a nymserver like anon.penet.fi,
where folks can create an alias and send/recieve mail/postings to it.  However, unlike Julf's system, a secure nymserver would prevent the owner from being able to divulge who the real-life person is behind the
alias because of the PGP encrypted reply block and other options

This was from one of the discussion groups concerning InterNIC's operation
of the whois services, registration services, etc.  I found it quite
interesting that they were logging this sort of information.

Gondolin Technologies is proud to announce a new nymserver for the online community at .
This is the same service that is presently provided to the net at alpha.c2.org, utilizing software written by Matt Ghio .
A nymserver allows any person with access to email to anonymous create an alias at  through which they may send/receive email.  This psuedonym is completely anonymous, and the identity of the user cannot be revealed as it is contained within a PGP encrypted reply block (unlike anon.penet.fi).
For more information, send a message to  and the help file with directions will be automatically sent to you.
The PGP public key for the alias-creation address is below:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6.2
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Please direct any complaints, comments, or concerns to -Bryan Strawser, System/Network Administrator, Gondolin Technologies
