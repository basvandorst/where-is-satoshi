If the jury isn't persuaded betond reasonable doubt that you were in genuine apprehension of serious harm

you will be acquitted of using violence to repel an

but your home.  Indeed, if the local prosecutor or US Atty believes,
on the positive side, that your actions were reasonable,
you probably won't even be charged.  Now, that doesn't of itself make deadly force right,

@_subject: Re: Rotenberg as the Uber Enemy 
Is one of the questions, whether we have right to take steps
to protect our "transactional" privacy?  The Brandeis and Warren
"right to be left alone" shares a connection with property rights
and has more than a nodding acquaintance with Fourth and Fifth
Amendment concepts--there's not much utility in a right to be
left alone if you have no place to be alone or if others can
enter your place/space at will.
Off your space ("in public") you can usually be observed; much
of the complaining in the past couple of decades is about the
increasingly sophisticated, even automated, means of observation
and recording, not about the fact that if you enter a premise
(say, a website:)) you can be seen and overheard by other people.
It seems to me this is a question of degree, and not a threat
to some pre-existing right to remain anonymous and "unseen"
in public. In other words, is there a right to forbid others
from trying to observe you in public, especially in places
where those others have an equal (or greater) right to be?
So the question may be not whether we can prohibit others from
doing so, by right, but whether we have right to attempt peacefully to *prevent* them from doing so?  I.e., can the gov't forbid us from trying to protect our privacy by avaliable
means, say, crypto?

a little strongly put.
As for Posner, who's often good for a laugh, particularly when taken out of context, his point so often reduces to
a simple one itself: Which is easier (cheaper, more efficient,
etc.), law or the market?  Given that perfection in markets,
as in golf and most other things, is unattainable, sometimes
we shall have to resort to law, as in the "negotiating with the
