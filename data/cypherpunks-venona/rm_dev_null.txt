Let me see if I get this straight...
  National security is important enough to strip the citizens of their
rights and freedoms and trample the constitution into the mud, but National Security is not so important that it can't be compromised for the purpose of removing competent white males from their jobs and
replacing them with less experienced and/or incompetent colored people
and women.
  Of course, when DEA agents are murdered because of incompetent
action promotees at NSA, the government will call for stronger controls
encryption and greater powers of surveillance of the citizens.
  While the government blackmails its own citizens with legislation
threatens to imprison them for actions matching those of NSA employees.
  Is the White House declaring this a victory for minorities, drug
and child pornographers? Politics makes for strange bedfellows.

Have you noticed they stopped bringing their goddamn goats with
them since the Marines took firm action?
Sure, pal. Since you're posting anonymously, I assume you have to
hide your identity because you don't have an Information Highway
driver's license.
Hit the road, pal. We're wise to your type.
Not me, buddy. I am a Masturbater of Deception, and I use my long
tongue to keep from leaving my pecker-tracks behind for others to
follow. AhhhhUuhhYAAHHMonger (See...now you can't tell who I am, can you?)
