Also interesting from a historical cryptography standpoint is the NSA
web site (which you probably already know about).
Interesting information about Soviet one-time pad ciphers and about crypto-related documents from the WW2 era that are being declassified.
[I really want to see the picture of a Japanese purple cipher machine.]
But keep in mind, as with the previous post:

If you can, you may want to get a hold of this book:
   Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier
   John Wiley & Sons, Inc. ISBN 0-471-59756-2
   It is a very good reference that will show you what the public 'state of the art' is.  [You might find that you have recreated something that has already been broken, or see weaknesses in your cipher like other cryptosystems in the book that have their faults exposed...]
    Happy hunting and hacking,

Yeah.  The headers on the 'SSL: The early days' mail from pgut001 look _pretty_ strange.

Again, you may want to do a web search with Yahoo ( or
hotbot ( or whatever.  There is loads of good info out
there and pointers to ftp sites ... you just need to do a little bit of
legwork to find it all.  (Along with being creative when asked for
keywords by the search engines)

I think that if the cryptanalyst knows that F has zero redundancy
that he can run searches from 0 to n bits for the key and have
the computer flag solutions that have zero redundancy.     I also think that a perfectly compressed file would have a relative
entropy value close to one also, hence the computer could flag possibles that have both characteristics.
   Hence, instead of searching for plaintext by counting coincidences,
we are searching the decrypts for solutions that have zero redundancy
and a relative entropy value close to one.  How many solutions will
have both these qualities?  I don't know.  But if the compression method is known, brute force will be tried, and only having to try to decompress (read) data that has the resultant characteristics
of compressed information will speed things up by quite a bit.
   Others may disagree with my thought-experiment and my approach,
but I think this is quite possible ... even to persons with limited
computing resources.

Message not delivered to recipients below.  Press F1 for help with VNM
error codes.               VNM3043 -- MAILBOX IS FULL
   The message cannot be delivered because the
   recipient's mailbox contains the maximum number of    messages, as set by the system administrator.  The
   recipient must delete some messages before any
   other messages can be delivered.
    The maximum message limit for a user's mailbox is    10,000.  The default message limit is 1000 messages.     Administrators can set message limits using the    Mailbox  Settings function available in the    Manage User menu  (MUSER).    When a user's mailbox reaches the limit, the    user must delete some of the messages before    the mailbox can accept any more incoming messages.

Anyone else having problems posting?  I've been getting a mailbox full
problem from a vaxen at mqg-smtp3.usmc.mil ... if anyone is interested,
will forward error.  This post may make it through ...

DEFINITIONS for budding phone phreaks:
NPA: Numbering Plan Area - known to us humans as area codes; instituted
circa 1947 for long distance dialing.
DTMF: dual-tone multi-frequency - known to humans as TouchTones(tm); used to dial telephones.
Advice:  Instead of getting your friend to build you a red box, get
a SoundBlaster Sound Card and get the sound file that is the
quarter tone.  Play this into a tape recorder or into a greeting card
that records sound and use at your own risk!
Also - find as many back-issues of 2600 (a print publication) and Phrack
(an on-line publication [text files]) as you possibly can.  Memorize
them and you will be on your way to becoming a phone phreak!

One more thing - if you are on the web, jump to your friendly
neighborhood search engine and look for your keywords you were
talking about:  phreak, blue box, red box, 2600, phrack, etc, many
more to choose from.
You may find some pages (a few) of interest.
