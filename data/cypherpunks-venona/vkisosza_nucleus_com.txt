@_subject: Re: List of reliable remailers 
Thanks Raph.  This is very helpful for those of us who are code handicapped.  This is very helpful as a general guide.  Unfortunately, I've found that the information that it provides does not  help me with remailer reliability.  I've seen a remailer that supposedly has a latency of 8 or 9 hours, actually delay 24.  This makes your script fairly ineffectual.
You can't do diddly with bad data ...
