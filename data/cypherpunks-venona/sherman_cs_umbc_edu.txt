@_subject: Re: $50 encryption policy contest 
Your point is well taken.  I should have explained that I am
seeking assistance for altruism from someone who is interested
in crypto policy.  For example, no one is compensating me for
the many hours I've volunteered to pull off this two-part
lecture series (and it was quite a challenge to get anyone
with government connections to go on stage with John Gilmore).  See    I'm also trying to help students by suggesting a concrete, worthwhile,
interesting project through which to learn about www programming.
I am open to the idea of a prize fund:  I will augment the
prize with 100% of all prize donations mailed to me.  If
each of 200 people send me $1, the prize fund will grow to $250.

@_subject: Barry Smith (FBI) to speak on encryption policy at UMBC 
The UMBC Security Technology Research Group presents
     A Law-Enforcement Perspective on Encryption Policy
    The second lecture and discussion in a two-part forum on
encryption policy.  Journalist Peter Wayner will introduce
and moderate the event, which is free and open to the
public.  In Part I, freedom activist John Gilmore and Fritz
Fielding (Ex-Associate General Councel, NSA) gave their
divergent views, focusing on the Burnstein case.
Barry Smith will articulate the needs of law enforcement to
conduct lawful wiretaps; he will advocate the use of
key-recovery techniques to achieve this end as a way that
provides adequate privacy to law-abiding citizens.
Schedule: The event will begin with a brief (10 minute)
introduction by Peter Wayner.  Following Barry Smith's talk,
which will last approximately 45 minutes, there will be an
opportunity to ask questions for approximately 20-30
Questions: Attendees are encouraged to ask questions in
advance by sending email to sherman
Directions: Take Exit  off interstate I-95 and follow
signs to UMBC.  LH III is in the Administration Building,
adjacent visitor's parking lot near the I-95 entrance to
UMBC.  Host: Dr. Alan T. Sherman

Why doesn't someone speed up the DES search with Hellman's
time-space tradeoff, whose precomputation could be done within
a month?
