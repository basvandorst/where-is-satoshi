I have no idea why I received the below message.  I don't know any of the
people in it, and I don't care about the issue.

I don't know what you're talking about.  Who is "cypherpunks," and who are
you?  Please don't answer...I'm just trying to figure out how I started
getting these wierd e-mails from people I never heard about discussing
something I never cared about.  I truly want you to have a great life...but please leave me out of it.

Ok...this is the fourth junk e-mail I've received that I don't want.  Your
account is in jeapordy, and my advice is for you to just stop sending me
this junk.  Take me off your e-mail list, NOW.  If this e-mail from me, being mad at you, is what makes you happy, and is
how you have fun, then you just have a personal problem and I feel sorry
for you.  Do what you can to heal yourself...meanwhile, don't send me anymore...your
isp provider is next on my e-mail list.
