What I wonder about is why anyone would use the Algorithm
that the NSA is probably best at breaking.  Breaking GOST was probably
their number one project for years, and I would suspect that they
have done it.

@_subject: Crypto++ port for Macintosh 
I have started to port your crypto++ librairied to mac, using
metrowerks.  I was just wondering if you would like a copy
of it when I finished?
All in all, a very interesting set of classes.
