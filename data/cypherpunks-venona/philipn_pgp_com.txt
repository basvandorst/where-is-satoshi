I've been a nervous wreck tonight, reading all of the forged
messages revealing the secrets of a number of my fellow PGP,
Inc. employees.
It is only a matter of time until the forger gets around to
me, so I might as well confess now that I've been stealing
money from the company and selling PGP, Inc. company secrets
to the competition.
I'm not proud of what I've done, but I am desperate to get
out of this madhouse. Pantyless women, men who shine their shoes twelve times a
day to peek up the women's skirts. Spooks all over the place
and Phil Zimmerman sending Tim C. May ASCII-art slams to the
cypherpunks list (while blaming it on Dr. Vulis).
The child-pornography ring and the incessant drug dealing
within the company are bad enough, but what I find really
intolerable is the support for terrorists and the plot to
help secret government agencies rule the U.S.
Of course, if you check the cypherpunk archives, you'll
probably find that Tim May predicted all of this happening
in a post he sent to the list in '92.
