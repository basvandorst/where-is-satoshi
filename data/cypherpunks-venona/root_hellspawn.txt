Actually, they call it the Molson Web Canadianizer, but it looks like an anonymizer to me.  You give it a URL and the Canadianizer grabs the URL and adds some funny canadian modifications to the page, and sends it back to you.  It changes all the links to link through the canadianizer, also, which is convenient. This page originally allowed you to specify a url, but now it seems they only allow you to click and grab a random page. Specifying the address to connect to in your browser will solve this though.. Heres the URL:

Yes.  We are planning to ship this effect with 3.5 version of Razor
next month. Not only does it remove the clients from your schedule but from your entire life using an advanced form of pattern recognition.  We need to get this approved by the bureau of tobacco and firearms before we are allowed to start shipping it though, because in some places its considered a munition.  Once approved we  hope we can open our market to annoyed people in other fields too.

This is a program i found on unimi that offers secure socket connections, utilitizing a simple server/client. It can be installed without root priveledges and uses d/h for key transfers. Anyone looked this package over, and if so what is your oppinion about it? Included below is the THEORY file that describes the key exchange:
The encryption negotiation is performed using a protocol similar to
FTP/SMTP/NNTP.  The client sends commands to the server and the server
returns a four-digit response code.  Unless stated otherwise, all numbers
in this document are hexadecimal with the most significant byte first.
When a connection is initiated, the server should send a 2000 response
indicating that it is ready to accept commands.
DH3DES - Diffie-Hellman Key exchange followed by Triple-DES encryption
      If supported, 3001 is returned.
      The following commands are then expected:
MOD - If an argument is supplied, it is the number, in hexadecimal, to use
      as the modulus.
      Responses:
       2210 - okay
       4031 - invalid number
       4032 - too small
       4033 - too large
      If no argument is given, the server should supply the modulus, sending
      2211 followed by the modulus.  If the server is unable to supply a
      modulus, 4034 should be returned.
GEN - this should follow MOD.  The generator to use.  The format is the same
      as that of the MOD command. The response codes are 2210, 2211, 4031
      or 4034
EXCH - Key exchange
      Client sends exch followed by gen raised to hir secret exponent.
      Server sends 4030 if a gen/mod has not been agreed upon.
      otherwise 2212 followed by gen raised to its exponent
ENCR - Begin encrypted Session
       4020 - No key selected for encryption
       2300 - Encrypted session begin
LPORT xxxx - this command takes a 16-bit hexadecimal port number argument,
      and connects to the specified TCP port on the local host.
      Responses:
       2400 - connected
       4010 - Unable to connect
       4011 - Access denied
RPORT xxxxxxxxxxxx - Connect to remote port
      The argument to this command is a 48-bit hexadecimal number representing
      the IP address and port number to connect to.  The response should be
      first 2500, then when the connection has been attempted:
       2400 - connected
       4010 - Unable to connect
       4011 - Access denied
QUIT - quit
      Response: 2100 - Goodbye
Summary of error codes:
1xxx - informational messages
10xx - server is supplying additional information that the client may
       ignore.
11xx - server is responding to a client's request for information
2xxx - okay
20xx - Server is ready
21xx - Disconnect, goodbye
22xx - Command okay
23xx - Encrypted session begins now
24xx - Session with another service begins now
25xx - Command ok, operation in progress, please wait
3xxx - ok so far, send the rest
4xxx - command was okay but could not be processed
5xxx - command not understood or not implemented
Triple-DES The triple DES encryption uses output feedback exclusive-ored with a
non-sequential counter.  There are three counters, each of which is
exclusive-ored with the data block before encryption with the
corresponding key.  The counters are incremented in each round by a
shared, secret value which is part of the total key.  The result of
each round of encryption is exclusive-ored with the data stream.

I think Texto is what you are looking for, and it is available from the cypherpunks archive in the steganography directory. If you can't find it, drop me a private note and I'll mail it to you...
A quick outline of its function:
It uses a file full of Mad-Lib type sentence blanks, and a dictionary full of words arranged by type (person, place, thing, verb, etc). There are 64 words of each type which correspond to the 64 ascii symbols used in pgp ascii armor, or alternately, the 64 symbols used by standard The sentence structures look like:
The _THING _VERBs to the _PLACE.
It selects an appropriate word type for the particular blank it needs to fill, and inserts the word corresponding to the symbol in the data to be Extracting the data from the resulting text is pretty straightforward:
All words that don't appear in the dictionary file are discarded. The words that remain are mapped back to their corresponding sybols. You can expect your data to grow to 10 times its original size in the process of steg'ing, and you'll have to ascii armor or uuencode the data before it can be stegged by this program, but its clever, and might fool a simple filter-bot or other program, although its doubtful it would ever fool a person.

I can't believe this one!
Peter Laws, a recent graduate of the University of Arkansas, maintains
electronic mailing list called "SCAN-L". The list is provided for
scanning enthusiasts. There are a few hundred subscribers to the list.
Recently, in a thread about scanning publications, an employee of
"A" apparently wrote something to offend someone at publication "B".
Lo and
behold, next thing you know, Peter is named in a lawsuit because he is
maintainer of the list.
Something seems very, very wrong with this. I've never heard of
anything like this before. Can a Email list maintainer be held liable for
someone else writes?
Peter *just* graduated, and he needs all the help he can get. Thanks,

Donno, the next hop from 64 words per type is 4096 words per type, a very tall order.
I've been working on a text steg'ing program for a while that operates under a different premise, however. It keeps a dictionary of word pairs, with each word in the pair being a synonym for the other.  It will read through a donor file, swapping words based on whether we need to hide a 1 or a 0.  The encoder is working right now but the decoder is not.
A quick example:
dictionary: 1=sofa 0=couch
input: The couch is very comfortable
output (0): The sofa is very comfortable.
output (1): The couch is very comfortable.
The output text is virtually identical to the input text, and would (in most cases) easily fool the average human reader, as well as fooling simple mail filters. The main problem is that very little can be hidden in a text file in this manner.  I have one peice of text that is 50k, and can conceal about 64 characters of data.  More typical numbers are around 15-25 characters/50k, which is why I never finished the decoder. Once i started encoding things, and realizing how little could be hidden in this manner, I stopped working on it. At the moment the dictionary is very small; nearly all of the words are relevant to only pornographic text (since porno is both predictable, and repetitive, i thought it would be a good place to start). :) I have the source code around, if you care to take a look at it.
