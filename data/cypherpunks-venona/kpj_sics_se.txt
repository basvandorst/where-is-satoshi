I wonder if you really can have a Copyleft and disallow the program source
to anybody outside the United States and Canada.  As you write the code is
under Copyleft, I hereby ask you for a copy of it.  FYI: I am situated in
the state of Sweden in Europe.  What is your reply to this?

Naturally.  I expect him to refuse.  My whole question is whether it is
valid to use Copyleft on code which is not freely copyable over national

You are ``beating a dead horse''.
I never wrote it was, is, or will be his fault.
Nor did I blame him for anything.

Actually, there are several operatib system products that do exactly that.
Ex: X Windows, BSD
Actually, this highlights the absurdity of the old Cold War rules.
