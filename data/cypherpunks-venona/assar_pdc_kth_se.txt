There are some parts of pgformat.doc that are not included in RFC1991,
especially the packets on the key ring.
That took quite some time for me to figure out...
As far as I remember:
CTB_PUBLIC_KEY_CERTIFICATE and CTB_SIGNATURE are always 2 bytes
CTB_KEYRING_TRUST and CTB_USER_ID are always 1 byte
Sounds like a good idea
