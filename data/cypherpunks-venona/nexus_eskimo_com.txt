Correct. And before they passed their law a few years ago it was only
illegal to disclose the contents of any conversation overheard, not
illegal to listen to it (which is the way it should have stayed, but the
cellphone companies found it cheaper to get a law passed instead of
securing their network).

Actually in Florida its illegal to even have a scanner in your car!
These folks have broken several state and federal laws, as well as the
congressman who leaked it to the newspapers instead of turning it over to
the head of the Ethics committe as he should have. Everyone involved here
is, or should be, in deep yogurt.
  I don't like the laws they passed, but since they passed them I want to
see them enforce them to the full extent posible. Then maybe people will
start to wonder why the transmission wasn't encrypted. Which also leads to
another question. How much information is in the clear from congressmen
and government employees who are clueless about the security of their
cellphones, cordless phones, etc?

I've also heard that some have hacked cellphones so that they can
become a 'clone' of an existing phone, receiving all commands to swap
channels, etc. But not sending anything back to the cell sites. (This is
different from the usual cloning that goes on where they duplicate the
phone and use it to run up enormous bills). I haven't found any concrete
refrences to this in my recent browsing though, so it may just be a

I received this in the morning CNET news:
HOW PRIVATE IS YOUR NET SURFING? FBI VS. CDT BATTLE WILL DECIDE
   At the FTC's online privacy hearings next week, the debate will turn
on the
FBI's right to "intercept" information on the Net. Listen to CNET
Radio to see
why the Center for Democracy and Technology wants the spooks to back
  So where does the FBI think they get their 'right' to intercept net
Who knows, but I'm sure its already happening and will continue to
happen no
matter what the FTC rules.

Yes, this is apparently how it happened. The robber tortured him for
the PIN, used the card to get $800 from a machine and then returned to
stab and shoot him. Apparently the murderer is one of his students (he
was a teacher in NY I believe). This happened after Levin asked the
class to write their biographies and revealed who his father was.
  I don't think there is any strategy in being robbed, only survuval.
Levin commited a grave mistake. Revealing his background to his class
was a very stupid move.

I definitely would not want an emergency PIN to fail to dispense
unless it dispensed some 00 buckshot. Now that's a thought. Enter the
number backwards and you get a shotgun blast to the chest.
  A Good Idea(tm) would be to have a reversed PIN number red flag the
ATM and
alert the police (as well as forward the videotape to the proper

would not
have helped him since it was a student that he knew and trusted. He
didn't feel threatened until it was too late for him.
  Also, if the card was one of the Visa Debit cards (or even a real
visa card
for that matter) there are tons of places that it can be used without
a PIN number or submitting to an ID check. Grocery stores and gas
stations are
two examples, although you cannot get cash from anywhere without using
the PIN
number (that I know of).

This is very true. We now live in a society that expects to be
'protected' from everything, including their own ignorance, by Big
Brother. Free Speech is just that -- free -- and should be accepted as
such. We have various private organizations that have made it their
business to oversee the truthfulness of product advertising and
quality and this is how it should be.
  I believe that we have actually given up some of our free speech
rights in order to be protected against the 'big bad companies looking
to rip you off'. This has resulted in the government making a grab for
more and more of our rights, the building of a buearucratic
infrastructure to support this grab, and a seperate society back there
in Wasington DC.

I think that a simple fdisk /mbr should take care of the problem.
The drive is booted from the master boot record. There is no way
around this without a bios change. LILO overwrites the MBR with the
LILO program to boot Linux (and other OSes on the system) so it too
would defeat their software.
  Doesn't sound like too much of a solution when you're dealing with
even a slightly knowledgable thief.

I agree. That's why I like my solution to finding my stolen car
better. A cellphone, GPS, and a little bit of glue electronics. If my
car is stolen, I call the cellphonein the trunk (or inside body panel,
etc.) enter my secret code and it reads out the current locaiton from
the GPS until I hang up on it.

  Notice that none of this exchange is signed in any way. I don't

I don't care if Netscape supports PICS or not, as long as I still have
freedom to turn that option off (and that it is preferrably not enabled
default, or indicates in an OBVIOUS way that it is active).
  This whole thing is a load of shit though. The government is
to have control over thousands of private computers and networks. No one
has to put their kids on the net (IMHO the damn thing is a large waste
time, they should be reading books or building things instead), so it
be the parents decision to give them access -- It is therefore the
responsibility to monitor their kids activities, not the governments and
everyone elses.
