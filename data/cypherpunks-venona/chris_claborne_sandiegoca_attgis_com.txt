   This is the kicker!  If what I heard is true, anyone can escrow the keys

rules by saying the magic words "matter of national security", so why don't
they require the keys be held by the govt?

@_subject: Tales from Tech Support 
This is just one of the incredible "Tales from Tech Support" you can find on web page:
Enjoy !
SuperMac records a certain number of technical support calls at random, to keep tabs on customer satisfaction. By wild "luck", they managed to catch the following conversation on tape.
Some poor SuperMac TechSport got a call from some middle level official...from the legitimate government of Trinidad. The fellow spoke very good English, and fairly calmly described the problem.
It seemed there was a coup attempt in progress at that moment. However, the national armoury for that city was kept in the same building as the Legislature, and it seems that there was a combination lock on the door to
the armoury. Of the people in the capitol city that day, only the Chief of
the Capitol Guard and the Chief Armourer knew the combination to the lock,
and they had already been killed.
So, this officer of the government of Trinidad continued, the problem is this. The combination to the lock is stored in a file on the Macintosh, but the file has been encrypted with the SuperMac product called Sentinel. Was
there any chance, he asked, that there was a "back door" to the application,
so they could get the combination, open the armoury door, and defend the
Capitol Building and the legitimately elected government of Trinidad against
the insurgents?
All the while he is asking this in a very calm voice, there is the sound of gunfire in the background. The Technical Support guy put the person on hold. A phone call to the phone company verified that the origin of the call was
in fact Trinidad. Meanwhile, there was this mad scramble to see if anybody knew of any "back doors" in the Sentinel program.
As it turned out, Sentinel uses DES to encrypt the files, and there was no known back door. The Tech Support fellow told the customer that aside from trying to guess the password, there was no way through Sentinel, and that
they'd be better off trying to physically destroy the lock.
The official was very polite, thanked him for the effort, and hung up. That night, the legitimate government of Trinidad fell. One of the BBC reporters mentioned that the casualties seemed heaviest in the capitol, where for some
reason, there seemed to be little return fire from the government forces.
O.K., so they shouldn't have kept the combination in so precarious a fashion. But it does place, "I can't see my Microsoft Mail server" complaints in a different sort of perspective, does it not?

@_subject: Re: PGP in Eudora and other mail programs 
I think what is going to happen is that Qualcomm will choose S/MIME
instead of PGP, since they are one of the companies listed as jumping on the
band wagon.     S/MIME scares me since I believe it to (normally) use weak encryption.
It is gaining in popularity and hype and might be just the product to lull
mass amounts of users into using weak crypto (read government readable).
Microsoft, Banyan, ConnectSoft, Frontier Technologies, Network Computing
Devices, FTP Software, Wollongong, SecureWare Lotus, and others are on the
band wagon as well.    From section 2.2 of the S/MIME Implementation Guide published by RSA
   "... U.S. software manufactures have been compelled to incorporate an
   "exportable" content encryption algorithm in order to create a widely
   exportable versions of their product.  "
   "... For outgoing messages, RC2 CBC at 40 bits is the recommended default.
   stronger content encryption is strongly recommended where there is some
   mechanism to indicate that the intended recipient(s) can support it.
   Even though S/MIME allows for any bulk encryption scheme to be used, all
I ever see advertised is DES.  Most companies, including Qualcomm who depend
on government agencies to give them licenses (like FCC dudes), will bend
like a reed in the wind when under pressure.  Follow the money.
