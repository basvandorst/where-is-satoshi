I believe this is overstating the case.  The only theorem along these
lines that I saw in Li and Vitanyi's book was that, for any logical
theory, there are at most a FINITE number of strings that can be proven
random.  The upper bound on the number of strings that can be proven
random is quite large, by the way -- it's larger than 2^n, where
n is the minimum number of bits needed to represent the logical theory.
Thus, although no algorithm can tell you, for all strings x, whether or
not x is random, it may be possible to prove a few particular strings
random (with respect to a given encoding of algorithms).

Continuing the discussion on whether there may exist a few random strings
that can be proven random...
But that's not what I was talking about; I specifically acknowledged
that there was no such algorithm that ALWAYS gives you the
answer.  But even in the absence of a general algorithm to decide a
problem, it may be possible to decide some specific instances.  For
example, a basic result of computability theory is that there is
no algorithm that will, for any program P and input x, tell you if
P eventually halts on input x.  Yet there are many SPECIFIC instances
of programs P and inputs x for which it has been proven that P halts on
input x; this is what the whole business of formal proofs of program
correctness is about.
This argument is invalid.  To see why, let's review the definition of
a random string.  Randomness is defined in terms of Kolmogorov
complexity, which is defined relative to any universal function U.  (A
universal function U takes as input an encoding of a Turing machine T,
together with its input z; its output is undefined if T does not halt
on input z, otherwise its output is the value T outputs on input z.
Each different effective encoding of program-input pairs defines a
different universal function.)  The Kolmogorov complexity C_U(x) of a
string x (relative to U) is defined to be the length of the shortest
string y such that U(y) is defined and U(y) = x.  In a sense, it
doesn't matter which universal function you use, since it turns out
that for any two universal functions U and V there exist constants c1
and c2 such that
   C_U(x) <= C_V(x) + c1  for all x, and
   C_V(x) <= C_U(x) + c2  for all x.
A string x is defined to be random (w.r.t. U) if C_U(x) >= x.
Trivially then, the empty string is a random string.  Also, Tim's
example is meaningless, since it does not give an algorithm.
(Caveat: you COULD construct a universal function U that has
Chaitin's book built in to it, but it is certainly NOT the case that
every universal function has this property.)
To prove that a nonempty string x is nonempty, it suffices to prove
that for all strings y shorter than x, either U(y) is undefined
or U(y) != x.  This amounts to proving the output (and halting
behavior) of a finite number of program-input pairs.  For some strings
x and universal functions U this task may be absolutely trivial.  Consider
a Turing machine T that always halts and always outputs the empty
string, regardless of its input.  Let z_1,...,z_m be m arbitrary
strings, where m exceeds the number of strings shorter than x.  It is
straightforward to construct an effective encoding of program-input
pairs for which (T,z_i) is encoded as the i-th bit-string in
lexicographic order.  Suppose that U is the corresponding universal
function, and let y_i be the encoding of the program-input pair
(T,z_i).  Then U(y_i) is the empty string, for all 1 <= i <= m.  Since
the set { y_i : 1 <= i <= m } includes every string shorter than x,
and x is nonempty, we then see that x is random (relative to U.)

Both of these examples are flawed, because the functions used are not
Not quite right.  The class of algorithms usually considered is the class of
ALL algorithms.  It is the ENCODING of algorithms that counts.  The
correct statement is
  "...the randomness of a string can only be measured relative to the
  particular encoding of algorithms being considered."

...a conflict in which the opposing sides were geographically separate,
making it easy to know where to aim an attack.  The situation is much
more difficult when the enemy is hidden among you.  Apparently, you've
never heard of the Revolutionary War, the Vietnam War or the
Afghanistan War.
My, my, more name-throwing.  You know, it never ceases to amaze me how
selective some people can be in the rights they support (and for
whom).  It always comes back to bite them eventually, though.  The
South might have successfully seceded if it hadn't been for their
nasty habit of keeping slaves.  Conservatives who supported property
rights but not certain personal rights now find that no-one's property
is safe under the civil forfeiture laws, which were passed to fight
the War on (Some) Drugs.  And those who support the right to use
cryptography, but not the right to bear arms, will find that the same
argument used against gun owners -- "X is a favored tool of criminals,
thus we must ban X" -- will be turned against users of cryptography.
You'd better learn to get along with gun owners, Phil.  You just might
end up sharing a prison cell with one.

Things "that the government doesn't like" and "serious felony crimes"
are not the same.  People in positions of governmental power have
all too often in the past used that power to harrass others who have
committed no crime.  Remember how Nixon used to sic the IRS on his
political enemies?  And the ATF has a sordid history of harrassing
harmless people, including trying to trick them into committing
technical violations of obscure gun-control regulations.  Often enough,
government officials harrass people who have broken no law, but have
only behaved in a way that those officials WANT to be made illegal.

Mike Godwin writes, about Clipper's key-escrow:
But the word "warrant" appears nowhere in there.  The agencies requesting
the keys aren't required to present a warrant; they're only required to
promise that they're lawfully authorized.  And if they lie the evidence
is still admissible in court and they suffer no penalty.  And what does
"lawfully authorized" really mean?  Depending on what legislation
Congress passes, it could mean no more than "my supervisor approved it".
