Sorry but there are absolutes and there is a moral yardstick.  Whether this
 is accepted or not is beside the point.
There has to be absolutes otherwise any action can be excused (or damned).
  The real cry should be
"God help us to instigate Your yardstick".  God doesn't change and neither
does His measure.
1)Love the Lord, with all your heart, with all you soul with all your mind
and all your strength
2)Love you neibour as yourself.
Everything else hangs on these.

But whoever said I'm in the US?
Where did I make any such demand?
However, if you believe in something to be life changing and beneficial to
      both the idividual and society you'll want or
be compelled to "pass it on".  I can't and do not wish to force any one to
      any point of view, that's pointless.
What I wanted to illustrate is that there are absolutes, to say there are
      no obsolutes is in itself an absolute and so is self
defeating.  We must have absolutes.  These are often agreed on and applied
      through the legal systems but they are still there.
Thus, when examining the behaviour of people in power we apply rules to
      encompass that power ie you can go so far and
no further.  When we are talking about national leaders in the west that do
      represent a wide range of views this can become
more difficult but there still must be a yard stick agreed.
PS If ol' Bill claims to be a Christian then he himself is setting the yard
      stick against we should measure him.

Because religion is dead.  It is a set of man made rules interpreting
what God has said.  I do not want to live in a "religious" society any
more than you do.  Theocracy (rule by the church, small "c") is never
a good idea.  Deocracy??? (rule by God) is.  God has already given us
His instructions for healthy life and society.  Most of our laws are
based on them but we keep weakening them to account for our own failings
and desires.
It is wrong to abuse children.  I reckon this is built in to just about
all of us.  It is in our nature to protect and defend our children.  No
matter where your are in the world this applies.  Our differing cultures
make some things acceptable to one and not to others but the underlying
nature is still there.  Also we may differ how we accomplish this.
Actually the speed of light varies depending on the medium and the mass of
an electron with its velocity.  You may deride my
absolutes but if applied by all we would have no crime, no divorce etc.
Boring??  Not really.  Many diseases and social problems
would cease or be reduced.

DNA testing can never prove anything.  It can rule out someone completely
and statistically make it
very unlikely to be anyone else.  But what about identical sib's.  They all
have exactly the same DNA!
There are cases of such children where one becomes a pillar of society and
the other less so.
A DNA database would allow loads of stuff to be done.  How about a designed
disease or toxin that
only affects certain gene carriers.  This could be added to the food chain
at any time you wanted
to incapacitate a particular person or group of people without comprimising
any one else.

@_author: same DNA 
@_subject: RE: DNA 
Ok so the genotype is the same (same DNA) but the phenotype is different
(what you see).  It's more complex than
this but there are all sorts of ways that genes express themselves and how
this can be changed.
A good dose of phenol or benzene can do wonders to your genetic material.
A trip to Windscale (sorry Selafield) to
inspect the inside of the reactor vessel etc all has an effect.  DNA
testing would probably never look at
the entire sequence anyway.  It would look at enough to give near unique
markers.  Using a "drill down" technique to
gradually exclude until only one remains.
ie normal number of gene pairs  (not many people live with duff code in
here but there are some)
male vs female   (50%)
blood group
Why use actual matching until you need to, it's expensive.  You get down to
a handful and test those on a wider range of codes.   You hope the samples
are good and the genes haven't been damaged or contaminated.
Don't rely on the science.  The science is our tool NOT us of the science.
We already rely too much on
the technology, science, methods etc.  This is not a scientific way of

I like the encryption bit.  Season your conversations with encryption and

@_subject: RE: I must admit. . . 
So maybe this needs a multi-phase approach.
1)The mail programs themselves will encrypt between servers.  This can be
used to both protect the message(s) from being read (easily).  Does PGP
also assist by doing some compression?.  Also it can be used to autheticate
messages using a signiture which will have the dual purpose of providing
some tamper proofing.
2)The receiving mail-server will autheticate the incoming message against
its own list of known servers, and validate that the contents of the
message as a whole appears OK.  Maybe it will flag messages that fail these
checks.  It can also flag messages that arrived without server encryption.
3)If the incoming decrypted message is not itself privately encrypted by
the sender it will use PGP to encrypt the message for the user before
storing locally.  If the sender has already encrypted the message then it
will simply store it.
A)All systems must have compatible encryption systems or access to those
systems.  (Why limit to just one?) and all those systems must have some
sort of agreed means of flagging the message to allow automatted
B)Some means of exchanging public keys must be developed.  This must allow
for keys to be changed.  What happens when keys are changed, and messages
are still in transit from the old keys.
C)Not everyone is wise enough to use UNIX.  Some people even use (pardon
the language) Windoze or even AS/400's.
There is plenty more scope for discussion here I think even if it is some
of the less verbally able slagging off about old ideas that can't/won't
work because ... etc.  Surely there are enough brains out there to thrash
this through properly.

This still does not address local storage on the POP3d server. I am
looking to setting up procmail to automatically PGP encrypt incomming

does not have PGP once the message is received by the PGP mail forwarder
the messages will be PGP encrypted (I have had several people contact me

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

Ever played Mornington Crescent?  Try the same thing with e-mail.  The idea

information of real importance.  OK so this will be just like any managment

Hack together a proggy to "encrypt" a message but really just generates
garbage, just like politicians.  Leave patterns in it so it looks real.
