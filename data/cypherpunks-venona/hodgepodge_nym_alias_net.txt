But according to alt.security.pgp (4/28/97):
BONN, Germany (Reuter) -- A German cabinet minister called Monday for
increased efforts to fight crime on the Internet and demanded that
cyber-sheriffs have keys to unlock coded messages.
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther told a conference ....."The
technical and organizational competence of agencies charged with
fighting computer crime must be strengthened." "The criminals are hiding in the anonymity of the networks, wiping
their electronic tracks." Kanther said.
So clearly the government disagrees.

This doesn't make much sense to me. If I were to use such a UTP[*]
then I'd simply get my signature key authenticated and then use that to
sign all my encryption keys rather than getting the UTP to sign them. So I'd get the benefits of a recognized authentication on my keys without having to worry about key surrender to governments. We don't _need_ to
have anyone authenticate our encryption keys, just the signature keys.
Or am I missing something? (Other than the obvious fact that this is just
the thin end of the wedge)
