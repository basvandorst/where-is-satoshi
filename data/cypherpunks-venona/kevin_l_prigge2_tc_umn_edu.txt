A few months back, some winos took most of Minnesota off the net
for a couple days. Upset with being kicked out from under a bridge,
they started a fire that took out the main fiber cable from downtown to MRNet + the U of M. Backup? Due to a mistake at a CO,
the backup link was routed thru the same area, and was also burned.
Interesting scrambling as nameservers puked and died.  Mutant Rob said:

Well, you can add me to the list. Although there are a couple of
problems with the Leahy bill, it still seems to me to be a step in the right direction. I'll answer up front. I work for the University of Minnesota. I don't
get a check, I have direct deposit. If you saw how much it is, you'll
*know* that I don't speak for them. I haven't lied for a couple of
minutes now, and certainly not about my support for the Leahy bill.
I'm not afraid of any right to privacy, in fact I insist on it and
support it whenever possible.
I don't know how you feel, and I wish you wouldn't show me, as I am
afraid that you feel squishy and slightly damp. That might cause me
to lose my appetite.

It's been calculated that in the case of PGP, to equal the work factor to brute force the 128 bit IDEA key would require a RSA key > 3000 bits.

I had heard through the grapevine about a year ago that US West (the
local Phone Monopoly) was required to turn over a list of all phones
that called a certain local number. I don't recall what the details,
but it implies that records of calls (from, to, possibly duration) are
kept at least for a time.
Interesting thought, but it fails when it gets to my scale. It would
be trivial to exclude a file or set of files from normal backup, but
it would be problematic to exclude files from filesystem dumps, etc.
The scale I deal with (40,000 users, 12gb of /home directory files and
about the same in the mail spool) would make it almost impossible to
provide this service with accuracy to my users.
I've been concerned about system logging on remailers, and what kind of
traffic details they could leave. If a remailer operator doesn't control
the machine that the remailer runs on, there can be no guarantee that traffic information is unavailable to someone with a warrant or a gun.
It wouldn't be to much of a stretch to imagine a coordinated raid of
all remailers, to "capture a terrorist ring" or some other likely

Actually, it has nothing to do with speech. Mr. Gilmore owns the machine, and
allows the list to be run from it. At any time he could stop allowing the
list from being distributed from his machine, as would be his right.
If he does not want someone using his resources, it's his right. The fact
that you're the only (someone correct me, was Detwieler also kicked off?)
or one of the only people that has been removed from the list due to
abusive behavior speaks volumes.
As to the cries of censorship and peoples rights being violated, I'd contend that rights are not a zero-sum proposition. The minute a person
exercises a right, some other person does not lose a right, or have a right violated. What some people would assert is a right (list membership) is actually a privilege granted by the owner of the resource.

Minnesota Legislature has a bill pending in both houses regarding
digital signatures, defines certification authorities, and provides
for licensing of authorities.
A quick read looks good, although I am not a lawyer. This only affects
digital signatures used in financial transactions, AFAIK, and does
not prohibit non-licensed cert authorities.

Circ uses 3DES for encryption and does key exchange with RSA. It runs on top of irc, and encrypts/decrypts by running a program
in the backgound. There is also a standalone client.
I'm not sure that authentication is wanted or needed for irc. There have been a lot of problems with people grabbing a list of everyone on irc at a given time, then e-mailing them spam or vague threats. ircd 2.9.2 implements the +a mode for channels
which somehow disallows listing user information even if you are
on the channel with them.
