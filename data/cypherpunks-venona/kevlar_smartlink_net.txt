Has anyone tried this out yet? Is it some lame scam to get alot of e-mail
addresses? The lack of information about what the hell "Builder Buzz" makes
me wonder...

Hash: SHA1
Now I read about this before it was mentioned on this list, and wanted
to comment briefly upon it.
Although at first glance this appears to be a hopelessly ineffective
way of communicating (it requires double the information, plus MAC's),
It does have some interesting possibilities.
For instance... Rivest mentioned in his technical paper that you might
use this in a situtation where you are multiplexing two or more
streams of information, in which one persons "wheat" is another
persons "chaff"... This would elminate the need to generate random
"chaff", and therefore bring the ammount of wasted space WAY down... I
could see this in use in situtations like LAN's or intranets, where
bandwidth is not nearly as much of a concern because there is usally
an overabundance anyway.
Something else that occured to me while reading this tho... a major
flaw if implemented "out of the book"....
He mentions generating random MAC's... and this would be allright
because the chance of randomly generating a genuine MAC is 2**64, or
10**19, but that is unacceptable, as the law of advrages WILL catch up
to you eventualy. Therefore his second party adding chaff idea is
failable. Of corse, this is easliy remedied at run-time by checking to
see if the MAC that was just randomly generated is genuine, and
therefore unacceptable.
I hope to stimulate discussion on this subject, and welcome your
opinions about mine...

Which rasies another issue...
I personally have always forseen the day when you will be charged by the
megabyte, and not the minuite. Picture this...
Your at the air port, and you need to see if a very important email has
arived... you walk to the nearest phone booth, which cosists of nothing
more than a little plastic booth for you to stand in, and an rj-11. No
handset, no keypad, no coin slot... just a jack. You take out your palmtop
computer, plug it into the jack, type in your password, download your
e-mail and attachments (about 7 meg in all, large attachments) and press
the Logoff button. A little window appears with the AT&T logo in the corner
and says:
Thank you for using AT&T for all your digital needs.
Total use: 7101k
Total charge: $0.71
$0.71 has been billed to your MASTERCARD.
Could you see ISP's and phone companys alike JUMPING on this?
There's a slew of questions that this raises... do you get charged for
uploading too? is it a different pricing system for uploading? do you get
charged less? more? is there such a thing as a free address, like our
present (800) or (888) numbers in which the recipiant picks up the tab? And most importantly... does it cost more to send your packet further away?
to another country?
I think I just slamed this idea into a virtual brick wall... Comments,
ideas, and criticisims are always welcome!
