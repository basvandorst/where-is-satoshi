Vaporware which I heard around CFP '95, and have been sort of wondering about
ever since...
Some one told me that some one else [possibly Matt Blaze] had been looking
at how much randomness could be got by forking two child processes which
would just run as asynchronous clocks: whenever the parent program needs a
little `random' bit, it queries both and gives (clock(A) + clock(B) % 2)
or something.
Questions about this [to the list]:
 * who has done any [the?] work on this?
 * was it found to be useful/good or not?
 * what would be the drawbacks to adding this [Yet Another Source Of Entropy]
   to the Netscape scheme?

Without an author-certification mechanism in place, you can always
claim forgery. In this case, to show reasonable doubt you would probably
have to prove that some one else would have a motive for forging it in
the first place.
This is one place where importance of digital signatures can be very
strong. *If* we were all wonderful little cypher-junkies and signed
everything, then we might plausibly be able to deny forged mail: "I
sign everything I ever send, it's hardcoded into my mailer, that
didn't come from me..."
As it is, in most cases we run on trust, except where we're deliberately
trying to make certain that matters are not modified or we're trying to
make things a matter of record. [Checksums of binaries, for example,
or press releases on controversial topics.]
I'm looking forward to the point where my mail reader will sort things
according to reputations I give correspondents, and perhaps flag mail
which deviates from the norm for each correspondent. [e.g., if Tim May
signs something, it's probably pretty severe. If a pgp-fanatic doesn't,
something might be up...]
I'm also looking forward to the point where I can be on a mailing list
where folks look at the first line of my .sig and say, "this is being
written by an individual" and I don't have to worry about them thinking
I speak for organisations. [Which one would I be speaking for? Shad

For methods of jiggering physical clocks, one might eventually reach the

I have a piece of information which I wish to remain secret until a well-

cause it to intersect the earth's trajector at that time [or shortly

Alright, so it's hideously expensive. But you could put a lot of information
into one packet. Apollo Assured Archiving could have fixed rates per megabyte,
with regular [monthly?] launches into reliable orbits. At which point the

Alright. I've lurked on this one-man issue long enough. The latest attack

Perhaps Dr. Fred fails to realise that some people *aren't* speaking

Dr. Fred will forward this `official Netscape line' to Netscape,
probably with the similar lack of proper attribution or recognition

We see enough press releases around here that we can recognise pronouncements
from the mouth of a computer company and those from individuals who happen

Nope. Claim is roughly along the lines of, unix is incredibly insecure
for networking, because of inetd, sendmail, ident, httpd ... but *if*
there's a bug in sendmail, the trouble is not with the poor sod who
put file access into the kernel, and definitely not with the person
who wrote pine--even though pine calls sendmail.
As you finally concluded, the problem is the web browser. I concede that
a web browser is a security hole by its very nature in that it makes it
a lot easier for anyone to grab anything from anywhere. (This is also
why web browsers would be unpopular with censors, if censors thought they
could get anywhere by arguing against web browsers instead of sites.)
Since you've now stated that the web browser is wrong and evil and bad,
perhaps it's time you explained your fix for the web browser. The
millions of users, even if they *aren't* the problem, even if they *are*
blameless for blindly accepting anything anyone sends them, even if they
are faultless to ignore any notes on security or care which come with web
browsers--despite all of this--will still want something like a web browser.
Your argument seems to be running to "users are stupid", but it's the
developer's fault that users are stupid, and the developer should protect
the user in all cases from their own stupidity.
People shouldn't make web browsers, because web browsers, in untrained hands,
can damage computers.
People shouldn't make guns, because guns, in untrained hands, can damage
I would say that connectivity is risk, and that those who want connectivity
must weigh those risks. I think most people weigh the risks of Netscape

Please take all of the following as being mystatements of
what I think, not statements of absolute truth. [That is,
call the CEC yourself.]
It is legal for a Canadian citizen to import PGP into Canada
under Canadian law. It is legal to use either the international
or yanqui versions in Canada--software patents don't apply [I
don't think].
It is legal for an American to give pgp to an American citizen,
a permanent legal resident alien of the United States, or to a
Canadian citizen, providing the receiver is in Canada or the
United States.
It is *illegal* for a Canadian to export pgp anywhere except the
U.S., if the pgp came from the U.S. and no substantial changes
have been made to it.
For more docs, see
[yes, I know, it hasn't changed in a while, and there's some stuff
missing [such as the Area Control List], but the most important
thing on that web page is the information about who to ask: there's
an office in Halifax]
My recommendation: get the international version of PGP. [Unless, of
course, the above statements are wrong, in which case my reasoning
in favour of the international version are faulty.]

@_subject: Re: Note on "Barring Netscape" 
this *is* fraud, in a way. Microsoft is shipping a product which in a
certain exchange claims to be a product of another company. Microsoft's
software is being treated better around the net because it is recognised
as Netscape, which it isn't.
It would be somewhat like me walking through the short line at Heathrow
as a EU citizen even though I'm actually a Canadian citizen.
If Microsoft had used "MSIE 1.0 (...)", then they would have to gain
"market share" in convincing the web that their browser is worth writing
content for. As a side note, there are suggestions that httpds should be
a little more intelligent about HTML, recognising which clients can handle
which versions of html [so that they would ship 1.0 to those which can
handle 1.0, 2.0 to those which think they can handle 2.0, and perhaps we
have a 2.0-netscape-ENHANCED-ha-ha-ha]. If this were to be encouraged by
both httpd creators and client creators, with both sides being honest,
then uSoft would not need to claim to be shipping Netscape. They could
just say html-2.0-microsoft-ENHANCED-ow-my-sides [e.g.] and servers could
check the 2.0 and pay attention to the rest if they wished. [On a side
note, if all governments decided to close up shop tomorrow, many people
on this list would be happy. Which is more likely?]
http, from my meagre understanding, is supposed to be a negotiation (among
other things) with both sides agreeing on what the client can handle and
what the server can offer. Perhaps Microsoft could be encouraged to be
honest about what they are shipping. (I don't doubt that other clients
may also lie about who they are.)
ps - Life might be a lot easier for everyone on the web if Netscape forced
     uSoft software to be honest about what it is.

The Lotus `solution' seems to be the action of an American company
shipping a product which effectively says to foreign users, "We don't
care about you as a market." That this is the so-called "export"
version is ironic. The keys are escrowed with the U.S. government,
and no one else. The French government should rightly cry foul, for
this is (a) encryption where they don't have the keys and (b) encryption
where another government *does*.
For the world where industrial espionage is supposed to be becoming
the top priority and  where there have already been ugly accusations among
teams at trade talks, the NSA has just scored a victory on two fronts.
They've forced a major company (they don't come much more major than IBM)
to ship a product which actually helps them in both aspects of their
mandate. Communications interception of foreign industries' groupware
is now easier for the U.S. than for any other country, while (and
this must be granted) the communications security of American
industries will be somewhat improved by this move.
This is a win for the NSA, whose mandate (much as their Canadian

for a really brief summary
of the assumptions I'm about to use.
a) if I use a chunk of data A to encrypt another chunk of data B, then
   my method of encryption is *not* a one-time pad if size(A) < size(B)
b) the security of a one-time-pad O is only as good as any encryption used
   to exchange O between two parties, which leads to...
c) if C. lu`Lez, an Idiotic Pseudo-security Generator, wishes to transmit
   a chunk of data A to L. User, then for A (if A is truly random to begin
   with) to have the security of a one-time pad, A must be exchanged using
   a one-time pad B where size(B) > size(A)
d) CONTRADICTION: If C and L already share B, which is greater in size
   than A, *why is C sending more keys*?
Of course, it all works out if you stop expecting A to be a one-time pad when
it gets to L.

I *think* that the Federal GST already applies to internet services: 7% on
all goods and services, and internet service provider as a term seems to
leave you wide open. The suggestion that this would drive out ISPs trying
to set up in NS is odd; the tax will make internet access more expensive in
NS, but with distances what they are in Atlantic Canada, there aren't many
options for going elsewhere. If it does anything, it'll drive the customers
of ISPs away, probably to New Brunswick. (Frank McKenna's government in NB
has made wiring the province a crusade, to the point where it is probably
the best-wired province in Canada, and much of it would rank against Toronto,
Montreal or Ottawa for sheer connectivity. At a CATA conference a year or so
ago, someone talking about the SchoolNet initiative remarked that, "in New
Brunswick, the washrooms had wire.")
This topic probably mainly comes up since the government of Canada is
currently making a tidy amount on the doubloonie, our new $2CDN piece.
[Rather pretty, two-tone, unfortunately, the copperish centre tends to
 come out with a little pressure, leading to the term, "pieces of two".]
Um. I rather doubt that the Bank of Canada is most worried about losing
money because people aren't using its cash any more; their greater worry
I would expect to be that they'll lose what precious control they have
of the Canadian economy.
This tenuous grip (though driven from the south) is fairly precious, and
becomes more so when faced with the prospect of Quebec trying to run its
economy without a central bank or currency.
