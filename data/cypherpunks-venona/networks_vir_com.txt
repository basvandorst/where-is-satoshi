The nature of the Internet means it is extremely difficult for John
to prevent Dr. Vulis from either posting using a pseudonym or
having messages forwarded to him.  IF it were possible to prevent
Vulis from either reading messages or posting do you think John
would have done that too?  Just curious.

It seems that, like a bookstore, the cypherpunks mailing list has the
right to choose the content it distributes and who it distributes the content
to.  Bookstores are free to select what titles they offer for sale, and can
even refuse to sell a book to a particularly annoying customer if they
so choose (my legal knowledge is lacking, but I think this is correct).
To extend the analogy, what has happened in this particular case is that Dr. Vulis is now forced to buy all his books by mail order :)

Just an interesting point here about the absence of * and # keys on Anguilla's phones...  The US is not immune from similar anti-
competitive tactics at pay phones.  A number
of new pay phones now have only numbers on
their keypads (no letters).  The reasoning
behind this is that people will not be able to
place their long distance charges though
other companies (e.g. 1-800 CALL ATT etc.).
