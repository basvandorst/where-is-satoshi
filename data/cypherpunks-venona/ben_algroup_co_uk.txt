Hmmm ... the EEC/UK regs on WMD have specific things to say about
crypto, and definitely restrict crypto export (at least in some
circumstances - naturally, the whole thing is horrifically complex and
no-one is about to explain it).

How about "perpetuity"? Nice and neutral. "Stored in perpetuity" is a
concept everyone understands, too. :-)

Clearly I failed to understand this, then:
"This note doesn't tell everything about our method--we *are* developing
a commercial product, after all..."
which somehow doesn't translate to "I can't tell you because it's
secret", it seems.

I hope you manage to persaude them then, because, as we all know, if it
is kept secret, then even B. Schneier saying it is great will not rescue
them from the snake-oil branding.

The 'I' word always makes me nervous - do you really mean that, or do
you just mean "very difficult"?

Which is:
a) not impossible
b) not proven to be as difficult as we think it is (cf. quantum
computers, novel factorisation methods).
That's why.

a) Who ever said this was unfair?
b) Several of the people who are complaining are about the GPL are not
people who want to use GPLed software, but people who want to release
their software under a free licence and think GPL isn't the right one.
c) In my experience GPL stops many companies from even considering using
code. A less restrictive licence gets it through the door, and they
later come to understand the benefit of freeing the source, even though
they are not obliged to. OK, so sometimes we lose under this scheme, but
sometimes we gain. d) As far as I can work out, someone who wants to free part of a
product, but not all of it, can't practically do so under GPL.

@_subject: Re: Wassenaar summary (and a funny new loophole) 
Hmm - so if I defined a new crytpo algorithm, SED3, say, that looks like
where backwards(k) is k with its bits written backwards, then the
3DES/SED3(k1,k2) combination is exportable (where k1 is related to k2,
of course, by k2=backwards(k1))?

Hmm. The "obvious reasons" being one or more of the following:
a) You think people shouldn't be allowed strong crypto
b) You think the US shouldn't have to go to the trouble of getting laws
changed, we should just obey their whims voluntarily
c) You are on the NSA's payroll
