@_subject: Re: Bad Signatures 
how does posting notifications to the list satisfy that objective?
read on....
True.  But my opinion is that this list isn't the appropriate place for it.  Opinions were asked for, that is mine.  A separate list Oh lord. I don't want to get into semantic hair-splitting.  It's the word I chose at the time.  It may be the wrong one.  Don't read too much into it.
To put the issue simply.
Bob doesn't like Jane for whatever reason.  Jane signs all her messages with PGP.  Bob posts false" bad signature notifications" to the list to discredit Jane.  Am I to just read Bob's messages and believe the notifications he's posted.?  No.  I still have to examine Jane's messages myself for signature authenticity.
I understand that this is one person who wants to perform this service objectively.  But why should I trust his motivations?  I still have to do my own individual signature checking to be sure.
For this reason, I think the idea accomplishes little.   The intentions are good, but I don't see a major benefit.  Maybe someone else has another idea or angle....
