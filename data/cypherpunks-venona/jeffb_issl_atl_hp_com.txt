I think you're exactly right about how cookies are used, but I believe
privacy concerns stemming from cookies have been blown out of proportion
lately.  For the average Joe User running his single-user PC at home,
connected by modem to his local ISP, it makes little difference whether
a site issues a cookie to Joe or not; his IP address already uniquely
distinguishes him.  The site can simply use his IP address as its
database index.  If Joe deletes his cookie file each night before
invoking the browser, the impact of cookies is completely negated.
Now for those of us who access the net from multi-user systems or from
behind a firewall, the cookie uniquely identifies a particular browser
instance -- that is, it makes us equal to Joe.  And that's the reason
cookies were invented in the first place: because IP address and other
information available to the server didn't provide a unique server
database index.
I don't mean there are no privacy implications at all, and there are clearly other ways of accomplishing the cookie's function.  My point is
that merely removing cookies doesn't really help Joe's privacy much.
And it's Joe we ought to be concerned about as he represents the typical
user of today as well as the future.

I for one reject your premise and your conclusions.  There is no indication that government is capable of addressing this "problem"
in a useful way.  In fact, I argue that the situation is at least
partially of government construction.  The government's hindrance of
crypto technology has undoubtedly slowed down and in many cases
entirely prevented the application of current technology to protect
the very systems the government now purports to be concerned about.
(This is not conjecture or speculation; it is fact.  I personally have
witnessed -- and, in some cases, been part of -- the many hundreds of
hours of productivity lost to producing and distributing security software
in ways that protect the company from ITAR violations, or trying to
formulate adequate solutions for the company's non-US customers.)
My message to a government concerned about the dangers of "information
warfare" (and its apologists): get out of the way and let industry work
on security.  Then you can choose from the products offered for your protection or develop your own.  But don't sit there and prevent or help
prevent deployment of security technology while decrying the lack of
I don't claim that the current security deficiencies are entirely due
to ITAR restrictions but it is certainly a significant factor, and there
is still zero evidence that the government is competent to help.  Let
them first fix their own problems (e.g. the alleged 250,000 DoD computer
breakins), *then* come help us in the private sector.

There *are* a lot of things government can do.  There aren't a lot of
things it can do well.  But you want to wait and see what a *government
study group* decides to recommend?  Gee, who can guess what they'll decide?
This wonderful little anecdote proves nothing by itself.  How many of
these merchant ships survived u-boat torpedos thanks to this hardening?
I'd guess the number's pretty near zero.
This is simply wrong.  There *are* restrictions on domestic crypto.  They
are restrictions imposed by the crypto export policy.   Maybe there isn't
an outright ban but there *are* nevertheless real restrictions (look up
"restrict" in a dictionary near you).  And tell Netscape there are no
restrictions.  We've all seen what they're going through to provide
download access to domestic customers for products with strong encryption.
News flash for David: jumping through these types of government-imposed
hoops costs *real money* that could be better spent elsewhere.
It is being done as we speak.  The government has clearly slowed the
process down though.  And the more governmental involvement, the slower
the process will go.  (And the quality of the result will likely suffer

Apples and oranges.  The costs of protecting companies' resources is not
so high and the potential costs of not doing so are far higher.
I'm merely pointing out the hypocrisy of a government that bemoans the
lack of security infrastructure even as it has been hard at work raising
obstacles to those that would build it.
Putting the government in charge of fixing security problems is likely
to result in an infrastructure optimized for surveillance, as we've seen
with other government-sponsored initiatives (Clipper, DigitalTelephony,
etc.).  The only security assistance that business and the public have ever
gotten from the government has been the kind with unacceptable conditions
(like undisclosed algorithms, "escrowed" keys, secret courts, etc.).
If the government wants to do that to its employees, fine.  (In fact,
if a private company wants to do that to its employees, that's fine too; I won't be working for them, but IMO it's their prerogative.)  But I
don't want the government telling industry what to do with its security. Furthermore, I don't want my tax dollars involved in funding (or perhaps
worse, "incentivising") it.  Just get government out of this business.

This isn't the same panel I saw mentioned on this list.  That one had,
as I recall, two individuals being selected by each of several cabinet departments and executive agencies.
Big companies like IBM, AT&T, etc. have *international* networks.  Hence,
the connection to the crypto export policy, which prevents comprehensive
security programs from being deployed.  As a "senior techinical executive"
(oxymoron alert) to Fortune 50 companies, I assume you know that and are
simply choosing to ignore it for the sake of your current argument.
There is more to security than authentication, as I'm sure you also know
but are choosing to ignore.  Authentication alone may suffice in some
situations but clearly not all.  And in fact, this merely supports my
point: left to government's preference, we'll all be well-authenticated
when the surveillance tapes are introduced into evidence. (:-)
Indeed.  This isn't a different battle, though; it's all interwoven.
I don't want the government responsible for "securing the domestic
infrastructure..." for the same reason that I don't want them telling
me where or to whom I can sell crypto.  They haven't any right to, IMO,

Yeah, right.  You clearly chose not to address the requirements of
international company networks in your argument.  You admit that such
companies have international networks, and that you knew it.  It was
obviously relevant and you could have and should have addressed it.
The fact that you chose not to speaks to your own lack of integrity.
To gain the upper hand in the argument is clearly your supreme objective;
any point that doesn't fit the argument is simply not addressed.
In the last round, you mentioned financial networks.  You conveniently
left those out here.  I argue that these as well as others require
encryption.  Again, the fact that you fail to exclude any "inconvenient"
scenarios in whatever happens to be the matter under discussion destroys
your credibility (well, it would have, if you had any amongst the members
of this list).
On the contrary, you are the one who responds to each objection by pointing out that there is at least one situation where the current
regulations do not completely rule out solutions.  As one who has dealt
with security problems in the trenches, I have been involved in numerous
attempts to tiptoe through the mine-field of crypto regulations in search
of solutions.  I would prefer not to have to do so as it's a huge waste
of my time, and my (and everyone else's) money and other resources.
Ouch, David, stop it.  Once again, I'm skewered by your rapier wit.
I have.  News flash for David: not everyone agrees on the meaning of
various clauses in the Constitution.  Believe it or not, reasonable
people hold opinions that differ from the gospel-according-to-Sternlight.
The constitution means whatever the Supreme Court says it means and
that changes from time to time even though the constitution generally
does not.
Unfortunately, you seem to believe them most of the time, and want us
to believe them too in this case, while I choose to believe them rarely
if ever.
As this debate has now deteriorated to the "Sternlight claims
defamation, demands apology" point, and the substantive content is
quickly approaching zero, I'll try to make this my last post.  (List

Oh joy.  You no longer need to be arrested to get fingerprinted
in Georgia.  On the front page of Wednesday's Atlanta Journal, under
the headline "Now you can get driver's license in minutes":
    The average 45-day wait to get a new driver's license in Georgia
    will be a thing of the past under a new system that will churn
    them out while customers wait.
    "From start to finish it takes about 10 minutes," said chief
    examiner ... in charge of the Georgia State Patrol's driver's
    license office in Milledgeville where the system went into effect
    on Tuesday.
    Previously, drivers received a temporary paper license that was
    good for 45 days. ...
    ...
    Officials at the Department of Public Safety plan to have the new
    computer system in 82 locations across the state by Oct. 1.  Georgia
    is the 32nd state with the system.
    After an eye exam, the applicant presses a finger down on a pad
    that registers the fingerprint in a state-wide memory bank.  Then,
    the examiner confirms the name, address, and identifying information.
    ...
    The licenses have a hologram of the word "Georgia" behind the
    driver's name, age and address, and a bar code on the back that
    contains a laser recording of the driver's index fingerprints.
    "We keep a memory bank that matches your fingerprints with your
    license," [DoPS spokesman] said.  "In other words, if you went to
    get a new license with a false birth certificate and your
    fingerprint didn't match the name, you wouldn't get a license.
    And you could also face possible investigation for fraud from the
    Public Safety's investigative division."
    ...
    "I think it's wonderful," said Katherine Kidd, the first
    Milledgeville driver to get the instant license.  "It's a great
    idea.  Now we don't have to wait forever."
    [ End quote ]
Just what I would have called it: a great idea.  Is it true that 31
other states take your fingerprint as part of the license application?

The constitution is entirely clear on this point.  There really is

(for their definition of moral).  Otherwise, why don't they come out and say "we oppose ALL government subsidies for art" and "we think
the government ought not promote any lifestyle"?

This is wrong.  2000 *is* a leap year.
A leap year is a year that is evenly divisible by four but not by
100 unless also divisible by 400.
For example, 1900, 2100 and 2200 aren't leap years, but 1600, 2000,
and 2400 are.
In C coder lingo:
IsLeapYear(long year)
    if ((year % 4) == 0) {
    }
    return False;

Absolutely.  One wonders also if she may be concerned about loss of
reputation capital (i.e. her ability to be an effective advocate for
the NSA/LEA types).  The recent report by a panel of well-known
cryptographers arguing that key escrow is technologically and
economically infeasible has made her look pretty out of touch, since
she's been arguing exactly the opposite for years.

I dunno about the last part of this, but I agree with the basic point
(yes, I agree with Kent! It's a miracle! :-).
I used to think differently, but I've become convinced that the cost
of e-postage isn't going to be high enough that it'll be much of a
control.  Network bandwidth used for the purpose of email transport,
even with increased spamming factored in, is simply too low to justify
charging much for it.  It will still be *way* cheaper than surface mail.
So unless the percentage of people who delete it instantly, sight-unseen,
is higher than I suspect or new tools make it easy to filter out all
spam, it's going to remain economically advantageous for the spammers
to target broadly.

Bill would call for greater Net privacy protection
WASHINGTON - Many people who surf the Internet don't know that personal
information on them can be collected at the sites they visit. But that could change under a bill to be offered Wednesday by a key
telecommunications lawmaker which aims to give computer users greater
privacy protections. The bill by Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., would bar companies from disclosing
or using without consent people's medical and financial records, as well
as government information such as social security numbers that are
available online, said spokesman Ken Johnson. As chairman of the House Commerce Committee's telecommunications
subcommittee, Tauzin has considerable power to advance legislation
through the chamber. A hearing is planned for this fall. The bill also would require companies to adopt voluntary guidelines to
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
protect computer users' privacy when personal and other information is
collected from them online for marketing purposes, Johnson said. Web site owners can use technology to track, for instance, hobbies and
buying habits of visitors. The owners can then sell the information to
advertisers and other interested parties without the consent or knowledge
of the computer user. The Federal Trade Commission is now looking into the issue. To
short-circuit any regulatory action, companies including Microsoft and
Netscape Communications, the biggest makers of Web browsers, have
proposed letting computer users specify what personal information they
are willing to share and with which Web sites. The bill also would require companies to adopt voluntary guidelines that
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
would help reduce junk e-mail, or "spamming" as it's called in cyberspace,
Johnson said.

If you merely point to someone else's content, I don't see how you
can possibly be found to have violated their copyright.  The "linkee"
site is the one publishing the information guarded by copyright, not
the "linker" ("publish" == to desseminate or make available to the
public).  IMO, you don't even need to cite "fair use" for this;
*you're* not publishing it, they are.  This is just an intimidation
tactic.  (Of course, if they have lawyers and money and motivation,
and you don't, it may very well work.)

Follow your own advice.  All this crap about NETCenter has nothing to do with our civil liberties.  Whether NETCenter is a good idea or not is a completely separable issue (which I see Tim May just covered
thoroughly), and is merely a fig leaf offered to spineless
Congresscritters to deflect some of the "criticism" they might
otherwise be subjected to on the law enforcement "issue".  The fact
that White offers it shows that he is just as spineless.
We shouldn't have to "trick" Congress into doing the right thing, or provide cover for them either.
As you say, though, let's keep this debate framed with our criteria:
Do you, Congressman, support the constitutional guarantee of free
speech, or not?

This is revisionist history.  I can't recall any intimation at the
time that any messages were filtered from the unfiltered list.
Obviously I can't say whether _all_ the censored articles came out on the unfiltered list.  But I do know that I received at least one message from Vulis with an unsubstantiated allegation [of a secret backdoor, I think?] in Stronghold on the unfiltered list, as well as
some later complaints from Vulis that Sandy's filtering was unfair
and hypocritical.  Unfortunately I didn't save the original message--
I just wrote it off as the typical Vulis spew.

As has been pointed out before, "C2Net" never "provided a list" (at least not one relevant to this discussion).  Since it is clear you are
fully aware of that, this is sufficient to "prove" to most of us the
charge of "liar" against you (ignoring the several hundred other examples that might come to mind from the last couple of years).
I don't particularly care about this except that it reinforces why
your credibility is so low here.
   [quoting Dimitri:]
Since obviously none of us who were on the -unedited list can say for sure whether we received everything sent to it, I can't say with certainty this never happened.  But....
This is the problem with being known as a liar.  Nobody is inclined to
believe what you say without substantitation.  So I still don't see any
reason to believe that anything was "censored" from the unedited list.
I don't recall ever seeing such a claim from Sameer or anyone else at
C2Net.  Though given your penchant for making such "accusations" yourself, one could understand the impulse for making such a claim.
The fact that *you* are constantly accusing people you don't
apparently know of engaging in various sexual acts or holding a certain
sexual orientation is evidence enough that you are unreliable.  It
seems to be your stance that you are free to fabricate anything the
truth of which cannot be utterly *disproven*.  This is consistent with
your allegations against C2Net's product as well as the allegations of sexual acts and preferences you habitually make.
Whether you like them or not, this is why libel laws and such exist.
If you accuse someone of having backdoors in their product, but cannot
or will not show any basis for the allegation, it's perfectly
understandable that they might threaten you legally.  And if you're
simply "throwing rocks" at Sameer with no substance behind your
allegations, the rest of us are unlikely to come to your "defense".
Also, here's a little hint (from a non-lawyer): truth is generally a
very good defense to a libel suit.  You may squirm and dance and claim
you don't want to deal with the hassle or expense of a suit, but we
all know precisely what that really means...

I understand this rationale.  But that doesn't explain what's happening to the missing messages.  Is there a flaw in the distributor/reflector duplicate-filtering algorithms?  Or is this
a problem of certain messages being introduced into a node whose
product does not get propagated to all subscribers of all the other
nodes?  Or are you saying that if ssz (say) goes down for a few
minutes it forgets about any mail it has queued up for its
counterparts at cyberpass and algebra (et al.)?
