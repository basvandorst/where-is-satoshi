@_subject: Clipper is voluntary?  Hah! 
I was just mulling over the assertion that Clipper would be a
"voluntary" standard, and I thought of an analogy.  At best (i.e.,
assuming the Government's not lying, which is sort of like assuming
smoking doesn't cause lung cancer), Clipper would be a voluntary
standard in much the same sense that VHS videocassettes are now a
voluntary standard.  If you don't like it, you can always get Beta.
Of course, good luck renting videos, exchanging tapes with your
friends, buying blank tapes, etc.
Note: I haven't read everything about this controversy that's come
across this list, so if it turns out that I've independently
reinvented this, then sorry for wasting your time.

From Charlie Root :
Well, maybe.  But doesn't the timing of this seem a little suspicious
to you?
"Well, gee, folks, the counterfeiters are just too slick for us.
We'll just have to go to Clipper-protected digital transactions [note: NOT
digital cash] right away.  We sure wish we had time for a national debate,
but those incredibly efficient counterfeiters are inflating the
currency and stealing us blind." -- Notional FBI/ATF/SS line.
Yeah, but *which* state?  Which state could easily turn out billions
of "incredibly good" counterfeit US bank notes?  Why let some other
country beat you to the punch?  Maybe they're not really counterfeit,
which might be why the SS agent was smirking.
Make no mistake, the U.S. Federal Government wants Clipper, and wants
to abolish cash, so it can spy on every aspect of its citizens lives
with impunity.  They understand the implications, and I wouldn't put
*anything* past them.

Read _Oath_Of_Fealty_ by Niven and Pournelle for some arguments in
favor.  Read _1984_ by George Orwell (already mentioned here, I think)
for some arguments against.
