@_subject: Extensis Mask Pro--Now with FREE PhotoAnimator 
Extensis Mask Pro-The Best-Selling Masking Plug-in for Adobe Photoshop If you think professional-quality Masking is a complex, time-consuming process...
Think again.    Think Mask Pro. SPECIAL OFFER: Order Mask Pro for $299.95 and get PhotoAnimator FREE! (a $99 value)
Mask Pro is the award-winning Photoshop plug-in that slashes the time it takes to create high-quality masks-with results that satisfy even the most demanding professional. Just ask MacUser:  "Mask Pro is lightning fast, easy to learn, and must be ranked among the year's top plug-ins".  But you be the judge.
The Advantage?  Color matching. Mask Pro's innovative color matching technology lets you decide which colors you want to keep and which ones you don't.  Mask Pro does the rest.  Using a color eyedropper, simply select which colors to keep and which ones to drop.  Then use Mask Pro's Magic Brush to wipe away the unwanted colors.  The Magic Brush removes the drop colors you selected, leaving a perfect mask-every time.  You have complete control.  Select color thresholds, edge softness, brush sizes, and more.  With the zoom, pan and navigator window controls, you can easily move around in any image.  And, with the unlimited undo/redo, you are free to experiment as much as you like. The precision and speed of Extensis Mask Pro cuts masking projects down to size.

price." - Publish, 12/98

before-enter Extensis QX-Tools 4.0. QX-Tools is an excellent collection
of XTensions and it's a good value too-even if you only use half of
them"-Computer Arts, 11/98

work more efficiently and intuitively."-eMediaweekly, 9/98
