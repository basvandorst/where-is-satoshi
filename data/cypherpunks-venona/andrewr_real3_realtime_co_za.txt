Phil Fraering   observes:
I haven't been following the DC thread so forgive me if I've missed something... If the objective is to keep what Alice and Bob say SECRET then we have a problem if the entropy per bit of Alice's data plus the entropy per bit of Bob's data is less than one bit, because then there is only one likely decryption of the "ciphertext", which will reveal what both Alice and Bob are saying.
The system is analegous to a variation on the old Vigenere/Beaufort cipher where instead of using a single repeated keyword to generate to encryption stream, you use another "plaintext" message such as a passage from a book which is known to both correspondents. (Here the addition is done mod 26 instead of mod 2).
Since the entropy of natural language is 1-1.5 bits/char, the entropy of two natural language texts added together is 2-3 bits per char, while the no of ciphertext bits is about 5 bits per char, so there remains 2-3 bits per char of redundancy in the text, which can (quite easily) be used to break the system even on a ciphertext-only basis.
One way to do this is to search for "probable words" of one side of the conversation, then see what the other text would have to have been to generate the known ciphertext, and if this other text makes sense then bingo, we have an initial break, and you can usually extend this quite easily by extending one text, then seing what this gives for the other, extending that, and so on.
I have to agree here, though!

The SSL project is at an advanced stage. I am regression testing the third (and, I hope, final) version of the SSL bruter, while Adam and others are working on the key distribution mechanism. It is important in a project of this nature that everything be thoroughly
