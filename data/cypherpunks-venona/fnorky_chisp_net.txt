Wouldn't this only work if import controls were put in place?  Right now
there is very little to keep me from buying non-GAK software from
other than TIS.

Good point.  I was thinking from the point of view of an individual or
small business.
I'm glad I don't have any government contracts.

Someone should talk to Larry Dowling (the lawyer looking
out for CJ's rights) about this.  This seems to be a
violation of the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act).

Ok, what kind?
Ok, lets look at Article V. of the US Constitution.
Article. V.
The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it
shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of
the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a
Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be
to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified
by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by
in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification
be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be
prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any
affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first
and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal
Suffrage in the Senate [Possibly abrogated by Amendment XVII].
As per Article V, two thirds of the States can call a Convention to
Amendments.  I believe this would be 33 of our current 50 states. and other holding would have no say in this.  At this point, if three
fourths of
the states agree to any proposed Amendments, it becomes the law of the
We only need two thirds of the States to start the process, but this
must be
done by their Legislatures.
I assume this would be either by nullifying Amendment 15 or modifying it
to a great degree.  Nothing else would work.
Actually, it would not be to get the proposed amendments on the floor. would be putting the proposal for a Convention to amend the Constitution
the floor.  In addition, depending on the State, the party would likely
to have a member elected to that States Legislature.
Another possibility, again depending on the State is to have a State
Constitutional amendment directing that States Legislature to vote for a Convention by a specific date.
That is why Article V was written as it was.  It provides a backdoor to
the federal government from getting out of control.

It seemed very clear to me that the "proposed by Congress" is refering
to any amendment proposed by Congress.

If you look at the relevent section of the Articles of Confederation,
you will see this is not a problem.
The Articles of Confederation Article XIII.
Every State shall abide by the determinations of the United States
in Congress assembled, on all questions which by this Confederation
are submitted to them. And the Articles of this Confederation shall
be inviolably observed by every state, and the union shall be
perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made
in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress
of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures
of every State.
The convention, the States, and the current Congress did as was
required under Article XIII.

I've been to Chicago exactly once.  I went to the Sears Tower,

My "cage" is in the suburbs, but I have to agree, it is still
a cage.  I can't wait to get my own land.
Some people are born and raised that way.  They don't know anything else.  And what they don't know, scares them.
