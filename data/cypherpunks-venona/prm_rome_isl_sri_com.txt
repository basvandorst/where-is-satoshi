@_subject: RC4 key search report 
Are there any technical reports available describing the RC4 key search
efforts?  I am interested specifically in number of machines (compute
power) and time to completion.

Just a few data points, for anyone who cares.  I've been through security
at San Jose, LaGuardia, O'hare, Saint Louis, and Dallas in the past two
months.  I have _never_ been asked for ID.  Just a valid ticket and, at
checkin, the usual "Did you pack these yourself?  Have you been in possession
of your luggage at all times?" questions.
