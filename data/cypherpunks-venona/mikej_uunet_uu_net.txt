If you use DES, you are just using a variation of DES in cipher
block chaining mode.  If you use some other hash function, your
cipher is as weak as the hash function.  If you use key bytes
directly to XOR with, and never reuse key material, you have a
variation of the one time pad (which is good, but takes LOTS of
key material).  If you reuse key material when XORing it directly,
you have a weak cipher vulnerable to a known plain text attack.
There is nothing really new here...
For more info on this, if you have a PC and a modem, you can call
a BBS at 303-938-9654, download CRYPTMPJ.ZIP, and read THESIS.DOC
in that file.  Perhaps one of you could put this file at an ftp
site for wider distribution?  The stuff in that file about data
compression is kind of out of date, but the cryptographic
information (including some source code) might be of interest to
some others in this group.

@_subject: Information theory and cryptography 
Robert W. Clark asks:
If you have the proper algorithm and key, then the same information can be
derived from both.  There may be additional information added to the
cipher text that is not relevant to the plain text if _noise addition_ is
used in the encryption.  The noise is stripped out on decryption.  Likewise,
data compression may be involved, so the cipher text may be smaller or larger
in physical size, but will contain the same information.  Note that strictly
speaking, the information in the plain text is conveyed by the combination of
the ciphertext, the key, and the algorithm used.  Take any of these away, and
you lose information.  In most cases, loss of the algorithm is not an issue,
but if you forget, lose, or damage either the key or the ciphertext, you have
reduced the useful information content, possibly to zero.
Sort of.  If I encrypt my communications with Alice, and you don't have the
key, then the information content of the message for Alice (who has the key)
is the same as the plain text, but for you the information content is zero
unless you crack the encryption scheme.
Decryption _always_ consumes energy (electrical, mechanical, biological or
whatever).  Do you have a computer that uses no electricity, heat, light, or
sound, does not eat, and involves no mechanical work?  If so, patent it quick
and sell it!  Don't confuse thermodynamic and information theory entropy,
though.  They are mathmatically similar, but measure different things.

@_subject: Information-content of ciphertext 
Yes.  Remember what information is (in the real world): it is what
reduces our uncertainty about things, it is what allows us to exclude
some things from the realm of what we take to be the case.  An object
contains information only in the context of some method to use that
object to reduce uncertainty.  Thus a piece of ciphertext may contain
information for Joe if he knows how to convert it to plaintext. If
Fred does not know this then for Fred the ciphertext contains no
information, since he is just as uncertain about the world after
receiving the ciphertext as he was before.
Information is information only if you can access it.  What was not
informative may become informative, and vice-versa.  It makes no sense
to think of information independently of a representational agent
(something which represents a state-of-affairs to itself) who is or
can be informed by it.
Mathematicians have a mathematical definition of information, but
mathematicians live in an ideal world, so their definition of
information is different from that of the rest of us.

@_subject: steganography and cryptography 
Kragen Sittler says:
For a steganographically strong code, it is not enough to make it
unrecognizable to its home program.  The ciphertext must look like something
"innocent" to either a human reader or a computer program designed to look
for ciphertext.  For example, the message could be hidden in the least
significant intensity bits of a bitmapped picture that the intended recipient
has an unmodified copy of.
If data that looks like random noise is innocent enough, then it is not hard
to hack PGP or write another encryption program that intentionally lacks any
signature information.  I wrote several programs with this property.  The two
best examples are CRYPTE and CRYPTMPJ, both of which are available on the
Rainbow Missions BBS at 303-938-9654.  This makes them a little harder to use
than PGP and similar programs, because the user has to know in advance when
encryption and decryption are appropriate, and which algorithm to use. Allowing a signature in the file format makes it obvious which program was
used to encrypt the data (thus slightly reducing security), but it makes it
easier to use the program.  This increase in ease of use makes it more likely
that it will be used, and that increases security.

@_subject: steganograpy and cryptography 
True.  I was refering to cryptographic security instead of steganographic
security when I said "slightly reducing security."  Sorry about the
miscommunication.  For steganographic purposes, there should be no _constant_
magic numbers or CRCs taken _after_ the encryption (and visible in the
ciphertext).  All magic numbers and CRCs should be embedded _before_
encryption and checked _after_ decryption when you want the ciphertext to
look purely random.  This way you can have _both_ cryptographic convenience
and random looking ciphertext ready for steganographic hiding.
Definitely.  Such a program is also very likely to drastically inflate the
message, depending on the definition of "innocent-looking" and the
characteristics of the channel or storage medium used.  For example, a
message could be concealed in the number of blank characters after each line
of text from an recipe book, but someone might even get suspicious about a
sudden interest in cooking among cypherpunks.  :)
By the way, I heard a rumor from a telephone company employee who I met (face
to face) who is in a position to know that a U. S. company was using DES to
communicate proprietary information between one of its facilities in Japan and
an office in the USA.  They got a letter from the Japanese parliament asking
them why they were sending encrypted data.  Perhaps there is more to the
question of steganography than purely academic interest...

The full design philosophy for MPJ is in my thesis.  Since then, I learned
about differential cryptanalysis and was relieved to see that MPJ is fairly
resistant to that.  Here is a short summary:

MPJ2      Not yet released   No          USA
DES Design philosophy:
(1) Fit in small chip
(2) Use involution for reversibility (only half of block changes with each
(3) Use polyalphabetic nonlinear s-boxes of limited size (requires great care
to avoid differential cryptanalysis)
(4) Some design criteria still classified.
3DES Design philosophy:
(1) Cascade existing known algorithm
(2) Avoid weak key situations
(3) Try not to require too much more key than the strength of the algorithm
justifies (i.e. just 2 instead of 3 keys are used).
(4) Apply a bandaid.  Making one compound block cipher would have been more
secure, but not all the s-box design criteria are known.
IDEA Design philosophy:
(1) Use unrelated arithmetic operations on different fields.
(2) Use only 32 bit arithmetic operations for speed on a computer.
(3) Arrange the structure of the algorithm to do proper confusion/diffusion.
(4) Very small code and memory space used in computer.
Skipjack design philosophy (guessed):
(1) Similar to DES, but with a block size of 128 bytes.
(2) No attack known to the NSA will be more than a bit or two better than
exhaustive key search.
(3) Learn from the mistakes of DES (i.e. avoid weak keys and complementation
symmetries DES suffers from).
(4) Restrict knowledge of the algorithm as much as possible.
MPJ Design philosopy:  (1) Relax some of the size limits of DES & IDEA to gain security, but make
sure it fits on a PC.  (2) Avoid fragile fixed s-box & subkey design of DES, but copy its product
cipher structure.  (3) Change the whole block with each round instead of just half (i.e. 10 MPJ
rounds is as effective as 20 DES-type rounds).  (4) Make every output bit a strong function of every bit of the input and
every bit of the key within 3 rounds.
(5) Use such simple operations in a complex and nonlinear fashion that
mathematical breakthroughs are not a threat (as with RSA).  (6) Make the substitution steps reversible through a very clever construction
of reversible substitution arrays directly from the key.  (7) Make key scheduling slow (to discourage exhaustive search for keys), but
make the algorithm very fast, especially in dedicated hardware.  (8) Make creative use of nonlinearity, bit twiddling, and rounds to thwart an
analytical attack using massive quantities of known or chosen plain text.
MPJ2 Design philosophy:
(1) Generalize the key scheduling to accommodate variable length keys.
(2) Generalize to n rounds.
(3) Attempt to do key scheduling on the fly in cases where the memory
required for precomputed internal keys take up too much RAM.
Common elements:  All of these block cipher algorithms use repeating rounds
of "confusion and diffusion" or "substitution and permutation" weaker ciphers
to form a stronger product cipher.  All of them are secure, even if the
cipher becomes known.  Skipjack is classified more to prevent knowledge of
design criteria and cryptanalysis secrets, and to allow the forced insertion
of a back door (LEAF) than for the security of the algorithm (just ask Dr.
Denning).  DES and 3DES can raise the price of unauthorized disclosure of
secrets above the average individual's means.  The others have the potential
of raising the price of eavesdropping by breaking crypto algorithms to above
the budgets of organized crime, hostile governments, and terrorists.  None of
them prevent other technological solutions to spying, such as placing bugs
closer to the target individual, office, or computer system.
General rules of the game in CRYPTOGRAPHY and CRYPTANALYSIS:
1.  There is always a way to crack any practical cryptosystem.
2.  Your opponent will not tell you if she has broken your cryptosystem and
is reading your mail.
3.  The longer any one cryptosystem is in use, and the more widely it is
used, the more likely it is that someone has broken it, or at least
discovered a weakness in it and not told anyone about it.
4.  The more widely used a cryptosystem is, the more profitable it is to try
to break it (for either noble or ignoble purposes).
5.  Exclusive control of the ability to communicate securely is a powerful
force that can easily be corrupted.
6.  Putting all your eggs in one basket is unwise.  Use more than one
cryptosystem, and change keys regularly -- even if you don't suspect
7.  Insecure cryptosystems often appear on the surface to be secure.  They
are often sold for good money.
DISCUSSIONS ABOVE ARE FROM MEMORY AND MAY NOT BE ACCURATE.  ALL DATA CLAIMING
TO BE GUESSWORK IS.  PROVING ANY CRYPTOSYSTEM SECURE IS USUALLY IMPOSSIBLE. INVENTERS OF CRYPTO ALGORITHMS ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO JUDGE THEM.

Yes.  Make "noise addition" (really multiplexing) part of the cipher.  You
could throw away every other bit based on the parity of the key.  The
ciphertext would be twice as big, but if you compressed both plain text
streams first, this effect might not be very obvious.  Of course, if your
encryption program were disassembled, you might be found out...

@_subject: Re: Need Suggestions for Random Numbers 
There is no such thing as real random numbers implemented purely in software.
The best you can do in pure software is a cryptographically strong
pseudorandom number sequence, started at a random point -- like continually
feeding the output of DES back to its input.
Try compressing the file with PKZIP & see if it gets smaller.  If it does, it
flunks.  If it doesn't, it may still have some patterns to it.
Not bad, but be sure to compress the output to remove the regular patterns of
the surf, etc, then use the compressed output -- after stripping off any
headers applied by the encryption program.

@_subject: Generating random numbers 
If you have an audio input to your computer, try recording noise from a fan,
traffic on a busy street, or the roar of a crowd at a football game.  Then
compress the output to remove any obvious redundancies such as 60 Hz hum from
a fan motor or unused dynamic range of the input digitizer.  This results in
much better "randomness" than some keystroke timing techniques.
Of course, writing cryptographic software would be a whole lot easier if all
computers had a built in real random number generating device that could
produce quantum physics related data as fast as you could read it.  Anyone
want to build a serial or parallel port attachment that could be read by
any software needing random numbers for crypto or other applications?

Amen!  But encryption IS regulated as a munition.  In military applications,
weak crypto could (and has) cost some people their lives.  Strong crypto reduces the power of governments or other entities to oppress people of
differing views.  Strong crypto is a powerful influence to resist oppression
of one group by another, just as Freedom of the Press, Freedom of Speech,
and the Right to Bear Arms do.  I don't see strong crypto as a threat to
Christians.  Strong crypto is a major threat to totalitarian governments,
spies, and criminals.  Strong crypto is a minor inconvenience for certain
law enforcement agencies in some circumstances.  Three out of four isn't
ideal, but life just isn't that simple.
By the way, if you think 700 Club support for strong crypto without key escrow is strange -- call my BBS for some amusement.  You will find Bible search software, church management tools, and two file areas devoted to cryptography.
Not everyone on this list is an athiest, anarchist, or whatever.

@_subject: Mail server for crypto files on csn.org? 
Problem:  the time-varying directory name changes too fast for reliable mail
server access to the crypto software on csn.org:/mpj/ for those who don't
have live ftp access, but are legally qualified to get that software under
the ITAR.  It IS possible, but you have to get README.MPJ then request the
software right away (before I log in to csn.org to check my mail the next
time -- usually one to three times a day whenever I feel like it).
Proposed solution   change the ITAR.  Unfortunately, I can't do this
unilaterally.  Write your Congressional Representative about changing the
Proposed solution   set up a "secure" mail server on csn.org itself.  My
idea is to have a filter program scan incoming mail for requests for crypto
programs.  The request would have to contain a statement that the requestor
won't break the law, as well as the names of the files requested.  If the
mail scanning program is able to detect a valid destination for crypto
software, it could then mail uuencoded or radix-64 encoded copies of the
software requested in the message.  Here is where I confess some ignorance
and ask for help:  How do I do this?  Could someone send me source code for
any automatic mail handling programs they have written for a Sun host, or
perhaps point me at some good documentation?  I could probably muddle through
this in time, but I'm not to proud to accept a head start.

@_author: FAQ 
@_subject: How to clear sign messages with PGP (FAQ) 
No, I just use this MS-DOS batch file called sign.bat:
pgp -sta +clearsig=on %1
The %1 expands to the first argument on the command line.  To sign a text
file called toscott.txt, I just give the command
sign toscott.txt
When you get a message signed like that, you should be able to verify the
signature by simply executing pgp on the file you get (provided you have my
key -- it is on the key servers, available by finger mpj or
mpjohnso ftp://csn.org/mpj/mpj4.asc, or on my BBS
pgp frommpj.txt
For more pgp tricks, see the FAQ ftp://netcom.com/gbe/ (echoed on
ftp://csn.org/mpj/public/pgp/) or on the Colorado Catacombs BBS.

@_subject: ftp distribution of strong crypto in the USA. 
Here is how to set up an ITAR compliant (I think) ftp site that you can place crypto files up for distribution within the USA and Canada.  The exact details will vary depending on your Internet service provider.
I think the method is sound, because it is pretty much what rsa.com does, and they have lots of lawyers to figure this stuff out.  You should take a look at their site and make sure that the README file you put up is close to what they have.
1.  Send a message to support to ask them to set up an ftp area for you (read the faq on it, first).
2.  Create an alias in your home directory to point to the ftp directory
(something like ln -s ~ftp/name ftp)
3.  Create a directory in your ftp directory called (exactly) I_will_not_export.  Set its permissions with chmod 711 I_will_not_export.
4.  Create a directory under I_will_not_export called crypto_xxxxxxx, and set its permissions to 755 (chmod 755 crypto_xxxxxxx).  Under that directory, place files and/or directories for USA consumption only.
5.  Set the base ftp directory permissions to 755
cd cd ftp
chmod 755 .
6.  Get the files gate and newdir from my ftp directory and copy them to your base ftp directory.
7.  Set the permissions  on the above files to allow execution
chmod 700 gate newdir
8.  Copy crypto_dir from my ftp directory to your home directory and set its permissions to allow execution.
cp ~ftp/mpj/crypto_dir .
chmod 700 crypto_dir
9.  Add the command crypto_dir to your .login script with an editor tool.
10.  Copy my README file to your base ftp directory, and edit to taste, but make sure the line with the crypto directory name is unedited.  Set the README file permissions to allow reading by the world (chmod 644 README).
Make sure the legal requirements to ftp are clear to the average jury.
11.  Set up .message files with appropriate messages for your directories.
The crypto directory name should be changed and README updated every time you log in.
Any questions?

WHERE TO GET THE PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY PROGRAM (PGP)
(Last modified: 26 April 1994 by Mike Johnson)
The latest commercial version is 2.4
The latest freeware Mac version is 2.3
The latest freeware version for all other platforms is 2.3a
If you are a commercial user of PGP in the USA or Canada, contact Viacrypt in
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is fully licensed to use
the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in commercial applications,
and may be used in corporate environments in the USA and Canada.  It is fully
compatible with, functionally the same as, and just as strong as the freeware
version of PGP. Due to limitations on ViaCrypt's RSA distribution license,
ViaCrypt only distributes executable code and documentation for it, but they
are working on making PGP available for a variety of platforms.  Call or
write to them for the latest information.  The latest information I have from
them on compiled versions are:
    MS-DOS 2.4
    Unix 2.4 (several different platforms)
    WinCIM CSNAV 2.4
    Mac version expected late this summer.

The freeware version of PGP is intended for noncommercial, experimental, and
scholarly use.  It is available on thousands of BBSes, commercial information
services, and Internet anonymous-ftp archive sites on the planet called Earth.
This list cannot be comprehensive, but it should give you plenty of pointers
to places to find PGP.  Although the latest freeware version of PGP was
released from outside the USA (New Zealand), it is not supposed to be
exported from the USA under a strange law called the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Because of this, please get PGP from a site outside
the USA if you are outside of the USA.
This data is subject to change without notice.  If you find that PGP has been
removed from any of these sites, please let me know so that I can update this
list.  Likewise, if you find PGP on a good site elsewhere (especially on any
BBS that allows first time callers to access PGP for free), please let me
know so that I can update this list.  Thanks to Gary Edstrom and Hugh Miller
for providing part of this data.

PGP 2.3A has been posted to the FidoNet Software Distribution Network and
should soon be up on most if not all Canadian and U.S. nodes carrying SDN
software.  It has also been posted on almost all of the major private North
American BBS systems, thence to countless smaller boards.  Consult a list of
your local BBSes; most with a sizeable file inventory should carry the
program under the filenames listed below.
If you find a version of the PGP package on a BBS or FTP site and it does not
include the PGP User's Guide, something is wrong.  The manual should always
be included in the package.  If it isn't, the package is suspect and should
not be used or distributed.  The site you found it on should remove it so
that it does no further harm to others.
