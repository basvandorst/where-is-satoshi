@_subject: More forged cancels 
These were found in control.  Note that they all have the string
"CANCELLED", and all are timestamped 17:56.
The first one is definitely forged.  The others look like they
probably are.  I asked Jukka Santala, and he didn't issue that
forgery.  I asked Joel Rubin, and haven't gotten a response yet.
I haven't asked the other people yet.
So I'll go ahead and post this, crossposted to the affected groups.
It looks like the Cancelschnauzer is hitting lots of groups.
A note to the canceller:  if you try to cancel this, I'll just put it

These others are suspicious, the Santala cancel is definitly forged.
I don't have the original posts of any of these, I suspect they are
all related to National Alliance.
