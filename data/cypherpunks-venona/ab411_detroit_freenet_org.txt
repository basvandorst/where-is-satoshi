The problem is, it's awfully hard to come up with a case where a beneficial
virus can't be replaced with a similar program that has the same features,
but lacks the ability to copy itself.
KOH is a good example.  There are plenty of good encryption programs out
there, so what is the advantage to making it a virus?  Precious little.
On the other hand, problems crop up, like: What if there are bugs in it?
How do you "call it back" and replace it with a bugfixed version?  How
does someone know, when it shows up on their machine, that it is still
the original beneficial program, and hasn't been turned into something

I'm rather hesitant to jump into this thread, but I think that one
reason is that Fred's concerns have been misunderstood a bit.  (If
I'm wrong, I'm sure he'll correct me.)
It seems that there are many people who are ready to leap to the
defense of the honor of the programmers behind PGP, when they feel
said honor is being impugned.
I get the impression (as much from what I know of his background as
from what he's said) that Fred is as concerned about PGP
being a correct implementation of the various algorithms it involves
as he is about back doors inserted by nefarious individuals.
As I understand it, it is impossible to demonstrate the correctness of
any program the size of PGP.  And it would also not be possible to
validate the compiler or the operating system.  One thing I'm not sure
of, though, is this: Would it be possible to verify a much smaller
program, say, the RSA-in-3-lines-of-Perl?  (Of course, you still would
be left trying to verify the Perl interpreter, and the OS again.)
And is there any way to build trusted system out of small, verifiable
pieces?  Since the way they're connected could also be questioned, I
suspect that when you put enough of them together it's just as bad as
the case of a single, monolithic program.  But this isn't my area, so
I don't know.
Would it be possible to formally verify at least some parts of a large
program like PGP?  And would that add to the trustworthiness of the
overall program?  (Keeping in mind Fred's earlier remark about a
seemingly-unrelated portion of the code overwriting the key.)

Keep down, I guess you meant.
Regarding the local farm software:
I agree that is the best policy -- it fails safe -- but I still think the
prefetching of some more segments would be useful.  The goal is to suck up
as many idle cycles as is practical.
And if it had grabbed 8 segments to begin with and crashed, it still
would have been 8 segments left unACKed.
Plus, it's only 8 segments unACKed if it crashes before it finished that
last segment, since it will start trying to ACK the first four segments
when it finishes the fourth -- at the same time starting on the next
four segments.
Would you see it any differently if I had said, "For instance, if it has
two segments allocated and it is halfway through the second segment, it
should request two more segments *while* it is scanning the last segment"?
Keeping in mind that it will still ACK the first bunch of segments when
it finishes them.

Differences: %j 1 -, because days of the year are numbered from 1, not

%y 70 -, because 1970 is the epoch, of course.
%y 69 - 4 / 86400 * +, takes into account all leap days in all leap years
up through last year.  Why?  Left as an exercise for the reader.  ;-)
3600 4 * +, this is a bit of ugliness.  date +%s returns GMT for me.
I'm in EDT, so that's four hours away from GMT.  So this is necessary to
make this return the same number as date +%s.  But if you're in another
time zone, you need to change that 4 above appropriately.  If this whole

Blowfish from the current 16, in order to improve the speed.  My question
is, would it be sensible to do it with an odd number of rounds?  If 10
rounds were a consideration, then why not go on to 11 to get the 5th
complete avalanche?  Or perhaps it would suffice to stop after 9 rounds,
after the 4th complete avalanche?
Is a whole number of avalanches a desirable feature?  Would an odd number
of rounds throw a spanner into the key schedule?

I think the IPG system is great!  Percy, my pet python, has never been
slicker or better lubricated!
What you have, as far as I can tell, with your "random-number-rotor-large-
random-prime-number-rotor-wheels", is a proprietary encryption algorithm
that uses a 5600-bit random number as a key.
There are two points on which you are to be commended.  5600 bits is
plenty large as a key (excessive, even), and you claim to generate the
key with a true hardware RNG.
Unfortunately, you are undone by two points which go against your scheme.
First, your algorithm is proprietary, and as such is probably not worth
a hill of beans.
Second, the keys to your system are known to three parties: the sender of
a message, the recipient of that message, and your company!  This means
that your company can intercept and decrypt any message that uses your
system.  All that is required is to keep a record of all keys generated
and who they were distributed to, and to know the identities of the
people communicating.
You've already indicated, when you claimed "790 gigabytes" of data
generated for testing with "multiple backups", that your company has
the capability to store and access multiple terabytes of information.
I'm sure you will protest your honesty; you may even *be* honest, but the
security of your system will rely not only on the security of the algorithms
and their correct implementation, but also on the honesty of your company
and every employee who ever works for it.
I don't need to trust R, S, and A whenever I use RSA, so long as the
algorithm is secure, and correctly implemented.
Of course it does.  Which part of "One" don't you understand?

Salman Rushdie, in a speech I heard several years ago, said that it was
widely doubted that Iran would or could actually come up with the three
million dollar bounty on his head.
This may play a large part in why he is still around.
Also, while speaking at the National Press Club recently, flogging his
new book, he said (from memory), "Iran now wants us to believe that they
don't want to kill anyone, and in fact never did.  I wish they'd told us
sooner, it would have saved a lot of trouble."  This was greeted with
laughter.  He added, "But when the European Union tries to get them to
put it in writing, they are unwilling to do so."
If Iran is sending mixed messages about whether they even *intend* to
pay off, coupled with widespread doubts of their ability to, it isn't
surprising that no one has offed him.
I think all the analyses of the economic costs of protecting one person
vs. protecting many people are rather beside the point, in light of this.
