  Actually, in my view, signed postings are the first step.  With those (and
  the right S/W (not there yet)), I get to know that a bunch of postings came
  from the same person.  I even know who they came from:  the person who
  is capable of signing with key 0xXXXXXXXX.
I hate to point this out, but that isn't true.
Anyone can create a key with any chosen keyid and
attach the same publicly known name to it. (see,
eg., the key I signed this with, given below).
The only unforgeable things about a particular
key are:
1. The key itself (you know, the product of the
2. The key fingerprint (unless MD5 is compromised)
and 3. The web of trust leading to that key.
So, in practice, you actually have to look at the
key fingerprint of the key used to sign a message,
if you want to be sure of the uniqueness of that
Or you have to only trust keys that come
well-introduced. Back to the Web of Trust.
  Since the only way I have of getting to know the person is through those
  postings, I get to know that person and through that knowledge I decide
  whether or not to trust.
I've been trying to think of the possible
ramifications of spoofing people's names and
keyids on a large scale. And a large scale is
certainly possible -- it only took me about an
hour to create this key. I was originally
intending to use this key as part of a real
project, to gain attention to the project, but the
more I thought about it the more I worried about
the implications. This "coming out" invalidates
any chance of that happening.
There are two bad things I can think of.
Suppose I want to somehow attack Fred. I can
create a key with the same ascii text associated
with it very easily. With only a little more
effort, I can also duplicate the keyid. PGP adds
new keys at the front of the keyring, so if I
start distributing this new key widely, it will
appear in keyrings before the "real" Fred's.
Whenever this happens automatically, there is some
possibility that the wrong key will be used for
some operations. PGP doesn't help much, because it
is hard to specify the key unambiguously in this
PGP uses more than just the visible part of the
keyID. So at least it will choose the right key to
verify signatures, right? Maybe not. I can apply
the same spoofing technique to the whole internal
keyID, and generated a key that even PGP can't
tell is the wrong one. I think that when PGP tried
to check the signature on a message from the "real"
Fred that it would notice that it had applied the
wrong key, but I'm not absolutely sure on this
point. Anyway, an inattentive or somewhat
automated user will merely notice that the
document signature fails to check out, essentially
slurring the "real" Fred's reputation.
Any other possible attacks?

I accidentally sent out the SECRET key not the

  I didn't see this result you mention, but it surprises me. The part about
  how it works in some bases, but not in decimal.
I assume it really works only in binary, and
hexadecimal follows, not the other way around.
  The "hand-waving" (motivational/informal) explanation for why I am
  surprised is that "Nature doesn't care about bipeds with 10 digits vs.
  bipeds, or whatever, with 2 digits or 16 digits." That is, results
  applicable in base 16, hexadecimal, should be easily applicable in base 10.
Sorry, but it is quite possible for this to be the
case. (I don't know for sure whether this is one
of them or not, though, having not seen the result
myself.) But assume for the moment that the
formula, or algorithm, or whatever it is, really
does tell you exactly the value of a contiguous
chunk of "bits", real honest-to-god binary digits.
You cannot translate these to a decimal
representation without knowing all of the bits
leading up to them. For example, you know the last
four bits of an eight bit string:
  XXXX0011
In Hex the last digit is 3. But what is the last
digit in decimal? If the 'X's are all 0, it is 3, but
if the last X is a 1 (making the number 00010011 = 19),
it is not 3 but 9. If only the first X is a one,
it is 1.
There are plenty of places in information theory
where a log base 2 shows up, so I don't doubt
that there might be an algorithm for determining
a particular "bit" of Pi. But just to prove I
have a more concrete example, suppose you have an
encrypted bank transfer, with the numbers
expressed in binary. Further suppose you know it
is encrypted with a one-time-pad (just to be
contraversial) where you know a particular n-bit
chunk of the pad. Given this you can recover the
corresponding n-bit chunk of the amount, but
unless this spans the entire number you can't
express this unambiguously in decimal digits.
This is a simple consequence of the fact that
log(2) and log(10) are not integer multiples of
each other (you know what I mean). The same goes
the other way, of course. Given a string of
decimal digits extracted from the middle of a
number, I can't unambiguously decide what string
of bits these would become without knowing the
rest of the number.
The result is fascinating, assuming it is real.

You create a revocation certificate at the time
you create the key, and store it somewhere (I'd
recommend putting it on a floppy). Then either
give it to your lawyer, with a note saying "If I
forget the passphrase, give me back this", or
just write a note to yourself, and store it in a
place where you'll find it when the time comes.
It is inconvenient if a nasty third party finds it
while you were still using the key, but much less
damaging than if they found the password.
(Someone wrote that PGP doesn't support revocation
certificates. This is not correct.)

A number of people have written words to the

  First Virtual, you lost a lot of ground with me.

I disagree. I think there is a big difference
between "knowing theoretically that X, Y and Z
are possible" and "look, I have a program that
does X, Y and Z in a certain order, and very
fast, and surprisingly successfully, and this has
major implications for the banking community".
I compare nsb's "meaning" as I understand it to
that of the paper out of Berkeley a few months
ago, which basically said "We've known for a long
time how IP snooping and replacement attacks could
theoretically succeed; here's a program that
inserts trojan horses while binaries flow across
the wire based on it." That was applauded as a
very meaningful result, even though the media
instantly picked up on it and blew it up.
I think most of the problem here is that we heard
about it in media words first, and in a reasoned
argument second. That's life. This is my first (and last) contribution to the
discussion. Sorry to add to the verbiage. I hope
FV and Nathaniel (as well as everyone else) keeps
