I think the whole idea behind stego is that it is non-standard.  The way in which you setgoize something must be constantly changing, otherwise the point of stego (hiding information inside other information) would be contradicted.  If there was a standard for hiding something, you would always know where to look.

This goes along one of the more cute ways of annoying any snooper on your lines.  If you periodically send noise over a suspicious line, you will give the people who are trying to monitor you a great headache.  This is one of the tactics that you can use to foil any attempts to crack your communications.  Then again, wouldn't it be weird if the noise you sent over actually decrypted into something intelligible?  This says something about 'noise'.  I know that it takes an incredible amount of mathematics to prove, but there must be a way to separate what is truly random noise, from that which appears to be.  The calculations to crack this are probably more expensive than the information it contains, so it is hence uneconomical.  But still, it makes me wonder.

I think you are probably not thinking about how Public key systems work.  It doesn't matter which key you use, public or private, each one reverses the effect of the other.  In this case what you are calling the secret key would really be the public key, and vice-versa.  You are just asking that the public key be known only among the recipients of the list.

@_subject: Re: basic RSA info 
From what I know, RSA thrives on the following formula.  Every key in an RSA public key system has two parts.  One part is a very very large number, and the other is a relatively small number.  We will call the large number 'l' and the small number 's'.  These two numbers are calculated beforehand (shown in a later equation).  To encrypt plaintext (which is what we call the stuff to be encrypted) with an RSA key, you use the following formula:
[ E stands for encrypted text.  P stands for plaintext ]
      P^s
E =  ------        l   In this example.  Let's use the letter 'A' for our plaintext.
Let's say we have a key with l = 85 and s = 3.  (don't worry about where those numbers came from, we'll make them later).  If we use the ASCII standard, the character 'A' has a value of 65.  So if we plug in all the values we get:
      65^3
E = -------- = 2307 and a remainder of 92
      119 To decrypt, you use the private key.  In this case, the private key is
l = 119   s = 32 and the new equation is:
     92^32
D = ------- = 6937619471... and a remainder of 65
      119
So we have encrypted with one key, and decrypted with the other.  Now as to how we arrived at these two key parts, I will explain.
When you make an RSA key, you generate three numbers.  Two of them are prime and one is just odd.  We'll name these P Q and E respectively.
The first part of the key is P * Q, the second part of the key is E.
In the above example, P = 17  Q = 7  E = 3.  So we end up with the key
{119, 3}.  This is the public key.  To make the private key, we keep the first part the same, but we change E.  The new E now equals:
E  =    --------------
              Eo             (Eo means the old value of E)
So the value of E for the private key is (16 * 6) / 3 = 32.  Now that I think about it.  I am sure to have messed something up.  Please send a flame back attacking what I foobared.  Thank you.

okay...  overall pretty good tho.
The encryption exponent must not contain any common factors with
(p-1)(q-1).  This means that it is always odd, but that's not
necessarily the only factor that you need to check.
The remainder, not the quotient.  Usually written as E = P^s mod l

A similar one they use at the white house uses a card system.  The card has an internal clock that is synchronized once to a clock on the system.
The card uses a special algorithm that changes the password every second or so in sync with the main system.  When you plug into the system, it reads your card, and if it is in sync, then you are allowed access.
