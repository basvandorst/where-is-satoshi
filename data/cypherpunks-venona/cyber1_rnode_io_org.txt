I'm posting this from Toronto, and I have no direct knowledge of what
took the Cypherpunks list down, but here's my guess:
The CP list is run my "majordomo" [MJD], a group of Perl scripts.
According to the MJD docs:
"If you'd like a list with the absolute minimum of maintenance (but also
 a minimum of security), you could create an "auto" list.  All
 subscription or unsubscription requests will be honored without any
 input from the list owner.  For example, anyone could unsubscribe
 anyone else."
 - unsubscribe list [address]
 This unsubscribes the user (or "address") from "list".
This means that anyone could write a message to majordomo with
the following message:
unsubscribe cypherpunks user1
unsubscribe cypherpunks user2
unsubscribe cypherpunks user3
... and so on.  Forgery is unnecessary.
MJD permits the use of a password by which the list owner can approve
unsubscription requests, but Sendmail displays this password. See:
telnet toad.com 25

==== What it means ========================================================
  -l        list name
  -h        host name
  -f        "sender" (default -request)
  -p       add "Precedence: " header
  -I        Bounce messages from users not listed in file
                               in colon-separated  *
  -a           approval password **
  -s                   enable "administrivia" checks
 * Note that majordomo postings can be limited to those on an approved
   list, but selected posters can not be excluded.  This is not
   appropriate for the Cypherpunk list, due to anonymous remailers,
   pseudonyms, etc.
** Note that if there WAS an approval password, it would be visible.
Fortunately, version 1.90 of MJD, which is now in beta, fixes this
problem by putting the passwords in a configuration file.  It is
available for ftp.GreatCircle.com.
What to do about abusive posters?  How about reversing the function of
the -I switch?
=== Here's the PERL code for option -I from 1.90 beta: ===============
if ( defined($opt_I) && defined($from) && ! defined($approved) ) {
    local($infile) = 0;
     = split (/[:\t\n]+/, $opt_I);
    foreach $file ( {
        if ( open (LISTFD, "<${file}") != 0 ) {
            close (LISTFD);
            if ( $ != -1 ) {
                $infile = 1;
                last;
            }
        } else {
    }
    if ( $infile == 0 ) {
        &bounce ("Non-member submission from [$from]");
    }
=== Now, with minimal hacking, this can be reversed, so that if the user
=== name is in the list, the incoming post is bounced to the list owner,
=== who can approve it or junk it.
So here is a technological fix, where we don't have to go bothering
system administators if they have a troublesome user.

In a column written for the Toronto Sun today, former Canadian Defense
Minister Perrin Beatty went on record as opposing the Clipper chip.
His reasoning:
"1) American policy can't apply around the world, and foreign companies
    will build equipment without the chip. Criminals will have ready
    access to scramblers without trap doors.
 2) The code the chip inserts makes it easier to identify information
    from a particular source. Instead of simply being part of a
    computerized stew, each piece of data is more recognizable and can
    be readily decrypted by the electronic key.
 3) If Canadian industry must include the chip in products sold in the
    U.S. and Canada, it will lose business to less buggable equipment
    from Asia or Europe.
 4) The chip could open our diplomatic and commercial secrets to U.S.
    snooping. The Americans are our best friends and our interests are
    usually similar. But shouldn't we at least be cautious?
 5) The requirement for a court order is fine if procedures are followed
    and no one breaches security, but what if the system breaks down?
    Should we rely on only one means of protection?"
My comments: Canada used to have that Saudi Arabia contract, so there
may be some economics involved. On the other hand, Mr. Beatty is
especially well informed and has shown an interest in privacy issues
for some time.
