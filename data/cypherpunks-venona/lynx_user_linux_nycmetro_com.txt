   Friday January 24 10:08 AM EST US Senator Will Reintroduce Encryption Export Bill
   WASHINGTON - Sen. Conrad Burns will reintroduce next week his measure
   to substantially eliminate export restrictions on computer encoding
   technology, a spokesman for the Senator says.
   "We are aiming for the 28th (of January) and it will be the same bill
   as last year," Matt Raymond, spokesman for the Montana Republican,
   said.
   President Clinton signed an executive order in November slightly
   relaxing export controls on encryption technology -- computer programs
   that use mathematical formulas to scramble information and render it
   unreadable without a password or software "key."
   But many in Congress and the computer industry have said the new
   Clinton policy did not go far enough to lift the Cold War era export
   limits that classified most encryption programs as munitions.

   Monday January 27 9:50 AM EST UAE Launches Service To Censor Internet
   DUBAI - The United Arab Emirates's monopoly Internet provider launched
   a service Saturday to censor sites in cyberspace that breached local
   moral values and traditions.
   Officials from state telecommunications company Etisalat said the new
   Proxy Service would be compulsory for the UAE's 9,669 subscribers, who
   will have to configure their web browsers that navigate the net by
   February 2.
   "The service was launched today as part of our efforts to improve the
   Internet service to our subscribers after lengthy study and research,"
   said one official at Etisalat.
   "We were working on it before some official statements were made on
   the need to control access to some sites on the service," he told
   Reuters.
   The move follows repeated calls to regulate access to the Internet in
   the conservative Gulf region, where most women are veiled, magazine
   pictures revealing cleavage or bare legs are blacked out and
   questioning the existence of god can be punishable by death.
   Some are worried about the spread of pornography as well as religious
   and political material through the worldwide network of interlinked
   computers.
   Last year, Dubai Police chief Major General Dhahi Khalfan Tamim
   created a rare public row in the UAE saying the information ministry
   and the police, rather that Etisalat, should be authorized to issue
   Internet licenses as it was their job to monitor data coming into the
   UAE and maintain security.
   Telecommunications experts say the Proxy Service will not be "fully
   water-tight," but would help block access to known and unwanted sites
   -- a list of which could be constantly updated.
   The proxy server will be pre-fed with Internet addresses where access
   is blocked off, industry sources said. But the server will be unable
   to block access if addresses of prohibited sites are changed, as
   frequently happens.
   Etisalat says it will disconnect any customer who abused its Internet
   services and violated "order and clear laws."
   "Singapore has succeeded to a great extent in its drive to control
   harm done by the Internet," said another Etisalat official. "Why
   cannot we?"
   Singapore government measures to regulate political and religious
   content on the Internet and keep it free of pornography became
   effective in July last year. They require all Internet service
   operators and local content providers to be registered with the
   Singapore Broadcasting Authority.

   Tuesday January 28 9:52 AM EST VeriSign Commercializes New Encryption Standard
   SAN FRANCISCO - VeriSign, hoping to push some recent Internet
   encryption research into use, says it has begun commercializing
   several products based on new industry encryption standards.
   First it has taken the Secure Electronic Transactions (SET) standard
   developed last year by an industry group led by Visa and MasterCard
   and started online distribution of digital IDs based on SET to Visa
   customers.
   At a conference in San Francisco sponsored by RSA Data Security,
   VeriSign also demonstrated digital ID smart cards using a PC/SC
   standard to get access to Internet sites.
   In a partnership with Schlumberger, which also manufactures the smart
   cards, Litronic, which makes readers of smart cards, and Microsoft on
   whose Internet Explorer 3.0 browser the smart cards will work,
   VeriSign showed how the smart cards would be useful for providing
   secure access to restricted Internet sites, or for transactions on the
   Net.
   "We are starting to see the industry support this Visa- MasterCard
   initiative with a lot of product efforts," VeriSign Chief Executive
   Stratton Sclavos said about SET.
   Smart cards are credit card-shaped plastic cards that hold a microchip
   that endows them with computer intelligence and processing
   capabilities. As officials from VeriSign, Spyrus and others described
   here, an employee would use the smart card to get access from anywhere
   to a corporate network and have all the key personal information as if
   the computer was programmed for that person's use. Likewise, a
   consumer might use the smart card in many different sites to do
   Internet-based transactions from kiosks or ATMs and so on.
   Sclavos forecast that Internet transactions requiring security will
   gain consumer acceptance in 1998 or 1999.
   He said 1997 will be the year that security apparatus is installed or
   deployed by merchants, banks and other companies. Then once deployed,
   consumers will start using it about a year later.
   Security remains a key concern of consumers about electronic commerce
   and Internet transactions, he said.
   VeriSign also announced its so-called private label digital ID program
   in which it is making encryption products for large customer-oriented
   companies, like brokerage firms, to distribute to customers for access
   to online accounts.
   And it announced a new service for the Electronic Data Interchange
   market that allows EDI to take place over the Internet instead of
   proprietary networks.
   Mountain View, Calif-based VeriSign considers itself the leader in
   providing digital certification for Internet access and electronic
   commerce. It has issued digital IDs based on other encryption
   technology it developed to about 500,000 people and on 14,000 Web
   sites, it added.

   Wednesday January 29 3:26 PM EST U.S. Encryption Envoy Seeks Industry Cooperation
   SAN FRANCISCO - The Clinton administration's newly named point man on
   encryption policy is citing international support for U.S. policies
   limiting use of encryption and called for industry cooperation.
   Ambassador David Aaron, special envoy for cryptography, said on a
   speech to the RSA Data Security Conference in San Francisco that U.S.
   allies support the concept of lawful access by governments and the use
   of key recovery mechanisms.
   Key recovery would involve storing encoding keys in escrow so
   authorities could get access to them to unscramble data in an
   emergency, such as to uncover criminal activity.
   The White House's continued restrictions on encryption have been
   unpopular in the cryptography community and among major U.S.
   corporations and high tech companies, which argue the limitations put
   U.S. business at a disadvantage.
   Aaron said some U.S. trading partners have misgivings about the U.S.
   government's decision in October to relax U.S. export controls to
   allow export of moderately strong 56-bit encryption, but were willing
   to cooperate on the policy.
   "As far as I can see, the international encryption market will not be
   a free-wheeling affair," he said, adding companies should consider
   that lawful access and key escrow capabilities may become "a growing
   international requirement."
   In his speech, Aaron also listed cases where the U.S. government said
   encryption was used in terrorist plots, drug dealing, child
   pornography and espionage, adding the White House, "in no way seeks to
   expand law enforcement powers nor reduce the privacy of individuals."
   But some independent experts who monitor cryptography policy disagreed
   with Aaron's characterization of the international posture following
   his address here, and leading U.S. legislators said they would
   continue to push the White House to further liberalize the
   restrictions.
   "I just don't think it will work," Sen. Conrad Burns, a Montana
   Republican who has been behind the legislative effort to promote use
   of stronger levels of encryption, said of the White House encryption
   policy.
   "I think if bad people want to do bad things to good people, they
   certainly won't want to file their key (with any law enforcement
   authorities)," he told conference attendees over a satellite linkup.
   Burns appeared in the linkup with three legislative colleagues to
   stress that together they would push to put "get the administration
   out in front of the cryptography curve."
   Marc Rotenberg, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Electronic
   Privacy Information Center, rebutted Aaron's suggestion that
   Washington has broad international support for its concept of lawful
   access by governments to the keys to encrypted files and
   communications.
   Rotenberg said at the recent Organization of Economic Cooperation and
   Development (OECD) meetings on encryption policy, that was not the
   case, nor were a number of countries pushing for stronger controls, as
   Aaron said they had been.
   In fact, countries such as Japan, Germany, Australia and Canada all
   have competing cryptography capabilities they are promoting, he added.
   The OECD guidelines are due to be published next month.

   Thursday March 20 2:56 PM EST Clinton Admin. To Offer Encryption Bill Shortly
   WASHINGTON - The Clinton administration plans to introduce legislation
   soon that would clearly affirm that encryption users in this country
   are free to use any type or strength of encryption technology, a
   senior administration official said.
   Currently, no such explicit law is on the books.
   Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch also told a Senate
   Commerce Committee hearing the bill would explicitly state that
   participation in so-called "key management infrastructure" would be
   voluntary. Key refers to the password or software "key" that can read
   encrypted information.
   The bill also would:
   -- Spell out the legal conditions for the release of "recovery
   information" to law enforcement officials. The bill also provides
   legal safeguards for third-party "key recovery agents" who have
   properly released such information.
   -- Criminalizes the misuse of keys and the use of encryption to
   further a crime.
   -- Offers, on a voluntary basis, firms that are in the business of
   providing public cryptography keys the opportunity to obtain
   government recognition. Such recognition, Reinsch said, would allow
   firms to "market the trustworthiness implied by government approval.
   The testimony came in a hearing on two bills introduced by Senate
   lawmakers that would remove almost all export curbs on encryption
   technology.
   The administration's newest export policy, enacted through executive
   order in November and in effect since January 1, allows export of
   stronger encryption than previously allowed.
   But it requires companies to incorporate features within two years
   allowing the government to crack the codes by getting access to the
   software keys.
   Administration officials said they opposed the export provisions in
   the two Senate bills, saying that the export liberalization goes too
   far.
   The bills were offered by Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Conrad Burns
   (R-Montana).

   Thursday March 20 2:57 PM EST U.S. Bill To Ban Internet Gambling Introduced
   WASHINGTON - A bill to ban all forms of gambling on the Internet has
   been introduced in the U.S. Senate.
   "Given the tremendous potential for abuse, addiction and access by
   minors, online gambling should be prohibited," Sen. Jon Kyl, an
   Arizona Republican, said. He was joined by two other Republicans and
   three Democrats in offering the bill.
   Currently, only computer gambling on sports events is prohibited. The
   legislation would extend criminal penalties to companies who offer all
   types of computer gambling.
   Communications companies regulated by the U.S. Federal Communications
   Commission would be required to discontinue services to any companies
   they carry that offer gambling.
   Kyl said the bill also eliminates ambiguity about the definition of
   bets and wagers to make any form of online betting illegal.
   The bill was introduced on the same day as the U.S. Supreme Court
   heard arguments about a 1996 law banning transmission of sexually
   explicit material on the Internet to anyone younger than 18.
   The Clinton administration argued that the law should be upheld to
   protect young children. Opponents said it violated free-speech rights
   of adult Internet users and should be found unconstitutional. A
   decision in the case is due by July.

   Thursday April 10 10:03 AM EDT Internet Security Code Said Vulnerable To Hackers
   By David Morgan
   ATLANTA - The new security protocol for safeguarding credit-card
   transactions on the Internet may have to change because the underlying
   cryptography is too easy to hack through and too difficult to upgrade,
   an expert says.
   Steve Mott, senior vice president of electronic commerce and new
   ventures for MasterCard International, said it could take hackers as
   little as a year to break the industry's standard encryption code,
   which is supposed to render credit-card numbers unreadable to
   outsiders on the Internet's World Wide Web.
   For that reason, the consortium of technology companies and creditors
   that has spent two years developing the Secure Electronic Transaction
   (SET) protocol may switch to a faster encryption system called
   Elliptic Curve, which is produced by Certicom Corp.
   The first complete version of SET, known as SET 1.0, will be available
   to software makers June 1 with core cryptography provided by RSA Data
   Security, a unit of Security Dynamics Technologies.
   "RSA is a very good starting point. But we suspect that in a year or
   two, the Kevin Mitnicks of the world will start to figure out ways to
   hack it," Mott said. Mitnick is one of the most notorious computer
   hackers.
   "The only way you scale an RSA is to add a lot more bits. You add a
   lot more bits and it becomes more complex software in terms of the
   interaction of the transaction messages. That's part of what's taken
   SET so long to start with."
   MasterCard has been helping put together merchants with its own member
   banks for SET pilot projects in Denmark, Japan, Taiwan, South Africa
   and the United States.
   Mott told a news conference at the Internet Commerce Expo that the
   Elliptic Curve encryption system would make a better encryption core.
   In fact, he said it would have been chosen in the first place if
   developers had been known about it.
   "It will fit on a chip card. I think its 160 bits equals security to
   1,024 bits of RSA," the credit industry executive said. "We anticipate
   putting it into some SET 1.0 pilots in the very near future this year
   in the U.S."

   Tuesday May 6 11:33 PM EDT Airlines Step Up Baggage Security Measures
   WASHINGTON (Reuter) - U.S. airlines started a nationwide domestic
   trial Tuesday to match passengers with luggage as a way to intercept
   terrorists who might try to get a bomb on a plane in an unaccompanied
   bag.
   The Air Transport Association, which represents all the major U.S.
   carriers, said the trial followed recommendations by a special White
   House commission formed after the explosion last summer of TWA flight
   800.
   Terrorism was at first thought to be the cause of the explosion that
   killed all 230 people on board the Boeing 747, but officials say
   evidence now lead to mechanical failure.
   John Meenan, Air Transport Association vice president for policy and
   planning, said the trial would run for about two weeks.
   He said the airlines were deciding the extent of bag checking, on
   Federal Aviation Administration advice to run trials at various
   airports, including hub and spoke operations and city-to-city flights.
   Meenan said there was a potential for delays when a passenger checked
   a bag but then, for any reason, might not board the flight and stayed
   back for a later connection.
   In the past, he said, that would not cause a problem.
   "But in the trial, if they find you are not there, they must find your
   bag in the belly of the plane," Meenan said. "The delay can be very
   significant."
   He said if one plane were held up for an hour at a busy airport, that
   would prevent another aircraft from landing and taking its place at
   the gate, as well as cause passengers to miss connections.
   "You have cascading effect," he said.
   FAA spokeswoman Rebecca Trexler said she hoped there would not be too
   many delays, adding that the trial was in part to see the effect of
   bag matching on airline schedules.
   Trexler added that airlines had the option of suspending the trial if
   delays were 20 minutes or longer, but by the end of the day she had no
   reports of any delays that long.
   Bags are already matched on overseas flights, Meenan said, but those
   are not scheduled as closely together as domestic flights when every
   departure and arrival is timed to get full use out of every plane
   making any delay costly to the carrier.
   He said he did not think bag matching was the answer to security
   because it would cause too many serious delays.
   He said the answer might be a combination of bag matching and
   profiling passengers to try to screen for further investigation any
   passenger who seemed to be a potential risk, also recommended by the
   special commission.

   Thursday May 8 2:16 PM EDT Bill Sought to Ban Military Firearm Imports
   WASHINGTON (Reuter) - A bill to ban imports of surplus military
   firearms back into the United States was introduced Thursday in the
   House and the Senate.
   Guns such as the M-1 carbine were given or sold by the United States
   to some 20 nations over the last 50 years. Sponsors of the bill said
   many of the 2 1/2 million weapons were now being imported to the
   United States and used by criminals.
   "These wartime weapons are the kinds of guns that criminals can easily
   convert into illegal, fully automatic weapons," Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
   a New Jersey Democrat, said at a news conference.
   Lautenberg said many of the weapons were coming from Iran, once a U.S.
   ally but now estranged from Washington.
   "The Ayatollah (Khomeini) must be laughing in his grave," Lautenberg
   said, referring to Iran's late revolutionary leader.
   Lautenberg was joined in introducing the bill by Sen. Barbara Boxer of
   California and Reps. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island and Carolym
   Maloney of New York, all Democrats.
   They said it would allow collectors to buy imports of rifles from the
   Second World War or earlier.
   "The Anti-Gun Invasion act will slam the door on weapons, once
   intended to help our allies, from coming back into our country and
   getting into the hands of criminals," Kennedy said.

   Saturday September 27 11:37 PM EDT Illinois Police Standoff Enters Sixth Day
   CHICAGO (Reuter) - A standoff between Illinois state police and a
   51-year-old widow in southern Illinois entered its sixth day Saturday
   with negotiations continuing but no progress seen, the police said.
   Sgt. Flynn Hanners of the Illinois State Police said negotiators have
   been contacting Shirley Ann Allen every 15 to 20 minutes to try to get
   her out of her house in Roby, about 15 miles east of the state capital
   Springfield.
   The standoff began Monday when Christian County sheriff's deputies and
   a family member attempted to serve court-ordered commitment papers for
   a psychological exam on Allen, he said.
   "Our whole design behind this is to get her out of the house and get
   her the medical attention she needs because she obviously has some
   mental illness that needs to be treated," Hanners said.
   He added that the police have been in constant contact with Allen's
   family and doctors and that a psychologist who works with the state
   police has been at the scene.
   Hanners said no activity has been seen since Friday morning when Allen
   fired a 12-gauge shotgun at officers and negotiators after the
   officers had fired six 12-gauge bean bag rounds at her, striking her
   three times.
   The officers fired after Allen left the house, faced the negotiators
   who were in plain view and raised the shotgun "as if to fire," he
   said.
   "Three of the six rounds struck her in the chest area, the midsection,
   but she was not stunned," he said. The bean bag shots are designed to
   knock someone to the ground, but Hanners said the shots had no effect
   on Allen, probably because of the number of layers of clothing she was
   wearing.
   Allen also fired at the police Tuesday when two officers has gotten
   close to the house "trying to get a look in," Hanners said. He added
   that power had been cut to the house temporarily Tuesday.
