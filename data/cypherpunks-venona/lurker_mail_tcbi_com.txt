@_subject: newsgoup gateways 
I was wondering if anyone could point me to some servers that will allow me
to post to newsgoupes.
I have seen some aroud that use the format:
        newsgroup
and forward the mail to the chosen newsgroup.

@_subject: Privacy Issues 
I am writing a paper for a computer ethics class about privacy and
technology.  I was wondering if anyone could suggest some good books,
periodicals, or (of course) reliable web sources.

@_subject: Re: IQ and age 
I would.  If you look at who has the oppertunities to go college you will
note that those who are good at taking tests (SAT, ACT, or IQ) are those
who get to go.  You will also note that money also breeds success, or can
someone give me an argument for the fact that there are more rich kids
going to Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and the like than poor kids. (These
schools almost gaurentee success.)
If you want to find a correlation look for it in money not tests.  And if
you are insistant on finding it in tests, ask why the scores are as they
are (was the test written to the advantage of one group over another or can
one group buy the "A" with special courses which teach the skills needed to
score high.)

I personally am getting sick of this thread of messages.  I have taken the
steps, as everyone should when annoyed by useless and bothersome threads
and people, to filter this thread and all messages written by Dr DV to the
Trash. (Maybe many of you could do the same.)
I would appreciate it if everyone who has been posting messages with the
above subject (actually 'slander and call for lawyers') please keep the
subject, to save those of us who choose not to listen to this noise from
the hassel of changing our filters.
Thank you for your understanding.

@_subject: Off topic litter on Cyperpunks 
What has happened to cypherpunks?  I joined this mailing list more recently
than many others who recieve it, but most reacently it has gone downhill.
The descriptions I have read (and I have read many) all state that this
list is deadicated to the discussion of cryptography issues.  Where the
hell is the discussion about cryptography?
Three fourths of the messages I have been recieving are off topic (Ebonics
and "Slaughter").  If I wanted to read about current events and holocost I
would have joined groups that were specified for discussion of those.

I'm not sure that you can go through such a procedure to attain a legal
"alias"; but on the other hand why the hell would you want to?
Think about it, if you will paper work with an institutions to attain an
alias you would have to give them in formation about you identity.  Short
of commiting fraud by giving false informaiton do you think that you have
really gain any privacy?  Anyone can still find out who you are.
