@_subject: Differences in key generation 
I've recently been asked if there are any differences in key generation techniques between US and non-US encryption programs.
For that matter, are there any *basic* differences between foreign and domestic encryption algorithms? (IDEA, LUC, etc..?)
I know the question is worded poorly; I'm wondering if there *is* a difference (I haven't ever assumed there was).
This is very important and I need a response by midafternoon. :l

@_subject: Re: Physical storage of key is the weakest link 
what does this mean, exactly? anything?
Here is a little-known fact.  In fact, I had forgotten it myself until
what Tim said reminded me.  Your PGP secret key file is partially encrypted
using IDEA keyed with the hash of your pass phrase.  But some fields are
left in the clear.  In particular, the number of bits in p and q is left
exposed, as is the number of bits in d, the decryption exponent.
Now, this is not really a big deal.  Usually with a 1024-bit key p and
q will both be 512 bits long, so knowing this for sure doesn't add that
much information.  And I don't think that knowing the exact number of
bits in the factors will help with the factoring when the two factors are
about the same size.  Nevertheless it does represent an information leak
that many people may not be aware exists.
One way an attacker might exploit this is as follows.  Suppose he wants
to do an exhaustive search of pass phrases.  As Tim said, a lot of people
may have ones which are easy to guess.  How does he know when he's guessed
correctly?  The secret key has a checksum (in the clear).  After decrypting
all of d, p, q, and u, PGP accumulates a checksum as it does this and com-
pares it with the checksum stored in the secret key.  If they match, PGP
(or the cracker) knows that he has used the right pass phrase.
This requires decrypting all four of these numbers, a total of about
320 bytes.  But he can do a provisional check much faster by using the
in-the-clear lengths.  Just decrypting the first byte of each MP number
allows you to see immediately what the bit length of the resulting MP
value will be since they are stored in MSB form.  For the most extreme
case, suppose the length of p were one more than a multiple of 8, say
505 bits.  Now we decrypt the first part of p and see if the first byte
of the decryption is exactly 1.  If not, we can know immediately that we
have the wrong pass phrase and move on without doing any more IDEA op-
erations.  This will immediately reject 255 out of 256 wrong pass phrases.
I don't know how much of a speedup you would actually see from this; IDEA
has a setup phase and you still have to run MD5 on each pass phrase.
But possibly it could be significant.

@_subject: FW: How do I know if its encrypted? 
That would be a little more secure, but I'm thinking that the "handful of
plaintext" would be a random number of some kind that the user prepends to
the file before encrypting. This is kinder on the data haven's CPU; compare
even 3DES of, say, 256 bits to IDEA of a few megabytes followed by MD5 of
same. Plus, it offers the operater even more deniability: he doesn't even
look at the whole file, but just enough to be sure that it's what it's
supposed to be.
Presumably, the data haven will specify how much a handful is, and offer a
client program that generates all this automatically.
You sent this to me privately, so that's how I'm replying. If you don't
mind, though, please forward this on to the list.

don't forget GhostMarks! :)
Also, there are other potential claims for this sort of thing. Based on
varying extents to which the "electronic money" is really secure, is
cryptographically interesting, etc.
For example, more than two years ago on this list (I think it was spring of
'93, but it could've been spring of '94) there were a flurry of
transactions involving the "MagicMoney" and "TackyTokens" of Pr0ductCypher
and others. I recall Black Unicorn and others talking about transactional
exchanges involving sixpacks of beer or soft drinks. I could check my
archives, but you get the point.
And before that, there were "HExmarks" being used on the Extropians list.
There was a nominal conversion rate to real dollars, and at the time I left
that list, I had more HExmarks than anyone else.
And dozens of token-based systems, coupons, LETS systems, etc. Not to
mention the various commercial smartcards and "e money" systems.
Granted, most of these are not "Chaumian," which is what most of us think
of us as digital cash.
Claiming credit for being first is a tough issue.

Sigh.  Apples and oranges, and they know it.
So how much work can 25 Crays do in a year?  Crack single-DES?
Maybe RC4/64?

but probably not for decent RSA key lengths -- more probably the hashing

@_subject: RE: Brute Force DES 
why not put together (a LOT of) disk space and we can build a table
(read: "a cryptanalytic time-memory tradeoff") for cracking DES? Using
the table, we could brute-search the DES keyspace in less time than it
would take to do an exhaustive search of a 38 bit keyspace, according to
the paper. 4 gigs is what, a couple of hundred nowadays?
Making DES equivalent to a 40-bit crack would take approx. 500Gig, but
publishing the table would push DES out usefulness. Certainly we could
scale back (make DES equivalent to a 45-bit crack?) if we don't have
enough disk...

@_subject: RE: Brute Force DES 
well, first of all, I wasn't computing 2^40, I was computing something
like 2^(56*0.667) * 8bytes/each or somesuch, I don't recall exactly as I
don't have the paper in front of me. In any case, it was the tradeoff
between time and space -- 2^40 in time was something like 2^38th in
space. But don't trust my numbers, get the paper and rattle them off
yourself. It just seems like if we're going to browse all of the way through the
DES keyspace, we _ought_ to take notes along the way -- that means
building a table. I don't care how big the table is; if it is only 2^30
entries (about 1G entries, each 8 bytes = 8Gig) we reduce our next DES
crack by a factor of 8. If we keep 2^31 entries (16Gig) we can cut it
down to 2^50, or a factor of 16. If we have 4 - 9 Gig drives (or perhaps
three drives and some wiggling, described below) we can save about 2^32
entries and the search becomes a measly 2^48. :)
To whittle this down to a 40-bit workload, we'd have to save 2^36
entries* 2^8 bytes/entry = 2^39 Bytes = 512 Gig. Yes, admittedly large.
What's the cheapest form of storage, magtape? How much can you store on
magtape? The entries can be sorted so that lookup doesn't take long even
when you have to mount tapes. Wiggling: We may be able to save less than 2^8 bytes/entry because we know the
quality that made the point interesting enough to save (say we only keep
points where the top 32 bits were zeros -- no need to save these zero
prefixes) but I suppose we'd only be able to cut this storage factor
down by a factor of two at most.
If you don't have Hellman's paper handy, the apropos formulas are:
Total time=T, memory=M, search space=N
Time/space tradeoff:
M=mt , T=t^2, m*t^2=N
In our case, N=2^56; M, T variable.
