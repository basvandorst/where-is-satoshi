Can you say "dossier society".  Hope you don't buy cigarettes or
booze, or you may find that you can't purchase health insurance.
The problem is that *you* are tied to the card.  Please note that
debit and credit cards were designed primarily from the point of view
of the vendors and merchants.  Not the consumers.

The few $50 and $100 bills I've looked at over the past year or so
have had a light colored vertical stripe on them that was slightly raised
above the surface of the paper and had *small* numbers on it.  Seems like it was designed to make counterfeiting harder and money
easier to trace.

I believe that there is a DSP of some kind in there in addition to the 68000.
Also, only their high end modems do CELP.  The regular 14.4/16.8 one doesnt't.

Does anybody *know* how existing secure phones do authentication?  I'm
familiar with the AT&T 3600, but I was wondering about a STU-III,
perhaps a Motorola SECTEL-1500, or equivalent Cylink. I assume that
they use Diffie-Hellman to exchange session keys, but what
public/private key info is stored in the phones (if any), and how do
you load it in?  Do you contact some kind of certifying authority to
download key info?  Is it stored in some kind of NVRAM, or EEPROM?
How many keys will the phone store?  I assume, given the presense of a
"zeroize" button that something useful is stored in the phone.  Also,
what is the "cryptographic ignition key"?  It is some kind of FLASH or
EEPROM?  What's on it? The key pair?

This is why you'd really want to run your modems synchronously.  You'd
just send HDLC frames that encapsulated IP packets (fragmentation may
be required).  This is how most IP routers work over serial links.

I believe that they also use small (microscopic) color coded chips of
plastic.  There is an OTA report on this topic with a name something
like "Taggants in Explosives".  I believe that the report is about 10
years old.

My understanding of the one in Campbell was that the company that
owned the van / built the gizmo got a cut of the action.  I also
understand that they discontinued it, because you had to post a cop
next to the thing so that people wouldn't just take a hammer to it.

@_subject: Secure phones - STU3 
For those of you interested in STU-III's, there was an article several
years ago in "Speech Technology" Magazine (now out of business), that
explained quite a bit about the Motorola Sectel 1500.  The 1500 is a
Type I phone (OK for classified conversations).  The crypto used
wasn't discussed, but there were pictures and an explanation of the
speech coding used and well as the feature set.  That particular phone
would speech code using LPC-10e @ 2400 bps or MRELP (Modified Residual
Excitation Linear Prediction) at 9600 bps.  Using the 2400 bps speech
coder, you could interleave data (either syncronous or async) and speech.
If anyone is interested, I can look up the citation.

Another nice way is to remove the dev files for the disk at
shutdown time.  Then at reboot, you'd have to manually create dev
files (knowing the major and minor numbers) and manually mount the
file system.  There'd be no trace.  This would work real well with big
disks... Is that a 1.0, 1.1 or 1.2G filesystem?  How much swap is
allocated, anyway?  You could also use a litte steganography and spare
out a set of ``bad'' sectors.  Some controllers will do the sector sparing
for you (transparently to the OS)...  All sorts of opportunities ;-)

@_subject: small memoryspace DES? 
You can get by with about 2KB of static table (sbox + permutation),
assuming you lookup the sboxes 1 at a time and fold the permuation
into the table lookup.
For the key schedule you'll need 8 bytes/subkey * 16 subkeys = 128 bytes
(You can do it with 6 bytes/subkey, but it's easier with 8 bytes/subkey)
I suggest that you look at the "descore" implementation by Dana How. You can find it with archie.
Also, if the uP that you are using has direct bit addressable memory,
the permuations stop being a problem -- say 2 instructions/bit.
Obviously, permutations are real easy to do in hardware.
In addition, I suggest that you do some back of the envelope
calculations to make sure that you're going to get the kind of
throughput that you expect.  The simplest way is to work out the code
for a single round, and then multiply by 16.  This will get you in the
ball park.
Have fun!

@_subject: LPC for speech (fwd) 
I am working on this very thing. We will be using LPC encoding for
   compression, IDEA for encryption, and DH key exchange for key handling.
   We plan to use something better than DH ASAP (something less vulnerable
   to man in the middle attacks). We plan to use 14.4kbps transmission
   speed.
I'd be interested seeing the protocol that you plan to use.  I've given a bit of thought to it, and it appears to me that the
protocol should negotiate *everything* up front.  This would include
data rate, xmit and recv speech coders, as well as crypto algorithm,
feed back modes, session keys, etc.  I've been thinking also that the
protocol should start out in async mode, and then possibly shift to
sync mode.  It should also be extensible.

Why don't you just call Mycotronix up and ask for data sheets on the
