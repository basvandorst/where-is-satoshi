"If you read one thread this year, read this one"
One way to find the following text is to look up S.974 on Thomas,
 and follow the "references to this bill in the
Congressional Record" link. Here's the URL I used, but I suspect this query
won't work from scratch: Deep down, I didn't truly believe it would come to this. Now I'm a believer.
I've inserted a few comments. If they seem alarmist, perhaps it's because
I'm alarmed !  I actually find Grassley's comments more frightening than the
text of the bill itself....
I get the impression that this amendment might also jeopardize anonymous
digital cash; Sec. 1030 (a) (3) makes it unlawful to "use a computer or
computer network to transmit a communication intended to conceal or hide the
origin of money or other assets, tangible or intangible, that were derived
from racketeering activity."  All these limitations on cryptography and
privacy seem to shift the effective burden of proof from the prosecution to
the defense -- Jennifer Q. Public can't keep anything out of the prosecution's
eyes, in case she might be laundering Mafia dough. If they're pursuing a similar argument with this amendment, anonymous
remailing may be in trouble too.  --- Begin Included Text ---
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS (Senate - June
27, 1995) Sen. GRASSLEY
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to introduce the
Anti-electronic Racketeering Act of 1995. This bill makes important changes
to RICO and criminalizes deliberately using computer technology to engage in
criminal activity. I believe this bill is a reasonable, measured and strong
response to a growing problem. According to the computer emergency and
response team at Carnegie-Mellon University, during 1994, about 40,000
computer users were attacked. Virus hacker, the FBI's national computer
crime squad has investigated over 200 cases since 1991. So, computer crime is
clearly on the rise.
Mr. President, I suppose that some of this is just natural. Whenever man
develops a new technology, that technology will be abused by some. And that
is why I have introduced this bill. << to make sure nobody can use it, lest they "abuse" it...
I believe we need to seriously reconsider
the Federal Criminal Code with an eye toward modernizing existing statutes
and creating new ones. In other words, Mr. President, Elliot Ness needs to
meet the Internet.
Mr. President, I sit on the Board of the Office of Technology Assessment.
That Office has clearly indicated that organized crime has entered cyberspace
in a big way. International drug cartels use computers to launder drug money
and terrorists like the Oklahoma City bombers use computers to conspire to
commit crimes.
<< I haven't heard much to suggest that McVeigh was using a
<< computer for anything, but we all saw this line coming, right ?
<< 3 of Tim's 4 Horsemen of the Infocalypse figure prominently here; I guess
<< Exon & Gorton have ridden off after the fourth already....
Computer fraud accounts for the loss of millions of dollars per year. And
often times, there is little that can be done about this because the computer
used to commit the crimes is located overseas. So, under my bill, overseas
computer users who employ their computers to commit fraud in the United
States would be fully subject to the Federal criminal laws. << So the U.S. Government now considers, among other things, the entire
<< Internet to fall under its jurisdiction. I think he's referring to << Sec. 1030 A (g). The provisions of that subsection apply to the entire
<< enclosing section, which under this amendment would include the
<< prohibition on non-GAK crypto on the net.
Also under my
bill, Mr. President, the wire fraud statute which has been successfully used by
prosecutors for many users, will be amended to make fraudulent schemes
which use computers a crime.
It is not enough to simply modernize the Criminal Code. We also
have to reconsider many of the difficult procedural burdens that prosecutors
must overcome. For instance, in the typical case, prosecutors must identify a
location in order to get a wiretapping order. But in cyberspace, it is often
impossible to determine the location. And so my bill corrects that so that if
prosecutors cannot, with the exercise of effort, give the court a location, then
those prosecutors can still get a wiretapping order. << I'm not sure where in the bill this is delineated. Would the police be
<< given a carte blanche to root around wherever the mood strikes them ?
And for law
enforcers--both State and Federal--who have seized a computer which
contains both contraband or evidence and purely private material, I have
created a good-faith standard so that law enforcers are not shackled by
undue restrictions but will also be punished for bad faith.
<< All together now: "TRUST US"
Mr. President, this brave new world of electronic communications and global
computer networks holds much promise. But like almost anything, there is the
potential for abuse and harm. That is why I urge my colleagues to support
this bill and that is why I urge industry to support this bill.
On a final note, I would say that we should not be too scared of
technology. << Did a staffer write this ?
After all, we are still just people and right is still right and
wrong is still wrong. Some things change and some things do not. << Did George Bush write this ?
All that
my bill does is say you can't use computers to steal, to threaten others or
conceal criminal conduct.
<< Ah, if that's all it does, why not scrap the whole thing and not waste
<< the Senate's valuable time ?  After all, stealing, threatening, and
<< concealing criminal conduct are already outlawed....
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed
in the Record.
There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record,
as follows:

In the subsection that explicitly mentions crypto, it says that it's
unlawful to put (non-GAK) crypto on an open net, "regardless of whether such
software has been designated non-exportable". If the phrase "nonexportable"
means the same thing in the context of this subsection, then provision (b)
would only seem to apply RICO to stuff that already falls under ITAR.
For whatever it covers, this provision conveniently makes you liable for the
actions of others. I could see quid pro quo between governments coming into
play here. They can get practically anyone connected with a foreign country to click a button on a Web browser, download PGP half a dozen times, and then
hit you with 7 counts of racketeering. Hey, they could run a net searcher
daemon that automatically snags a heap of copies of anything it finds that
looks like a non-GAK crypto app.  -Futplex

I agree, but AFAICS an odd form of transfer encoding is exactly what the

bells. Steganography amounts to laundering Content-Type: headers.
If the recipient isn't getting spammed with GIFs (or whatever), she (or
rather her MDA) can simply look at all of them by default. Of course this
does not help with anonymous message pools on the order of Usenet, but that
is a sub-issue.
Deranged Mutant raised an IMHO important issue a few months ago. He suggested
that Mallet could go about trashing the purportedly "random" bits in each
instantiation of some transfer encoding used in a stego standard. For
example, he shuffles the LSBs of every passing JPEG. I'm not sure how feasible
this would really be (both technically and sociopolitically), but it
could be a big annoyance if only a few people were suspected of using stego
method XYZ. The standard answer to agent-in-the-middle tampering is of
course digital signatures. Now, the question is, will we be allowed to sign
our possibly-stego-enclosing GIFs with reasonable confidence that the govt.
can't forge our signatures ? Obviously the signature itself can't be

Sure -- for most message passing applications, tampering in transit would
also lead to noticeably corrupted cleartext, when the stegoed ciphertext
is decrypted. Again, PGP pukes, or perhaps Stealth PGP gives me something
obliterated when it decrypts. See my comments below, however.
Well, you could do that regardless of what is or isn't stegoed into the
carrier image. I'm arguing that perhaps the govt. (or whomever) will be
far less sympathetic to such in-stego-channel evidence of doctoring. I still see an obstacle to this approach, though. If we want to try to
foil traffic analysis, then we need people routinely to dispatch ghost
messages. Some of these should go to people with whom the sender is not trying
to communicate. When Karen gets a GIF in the mail, she needs to decide whether
its LSBs are significant (semantically speaking :) or not. If they decrypt
into something meaningful, QED; if not, what to do ?  "Sufficiently
advanced communication is indistinguishable from noise" is a double-edged
sword, after all. Establishing that communication is really being attempted
is trickier under these conditions.
I think I need to clarify my threat model. I'm positing a scenario in which
transmission of ciphertext and stegoed anything is illegal, but transmission
and use of "conspicuous" digital signatures is legal. Furthermore, the govt.
sanitizes the LSBs of digital images for our protection, perhaps distorting
a mean of X% of the LSBs of a mean of Y% of transmitted images. Out-of-stego-
channel checksummation would IMHO be crucial in such a situation.  -Futplex    "A kiss and a hug and a couple of f*cks:                                     being in love really sucks" -Meryn Cadell

[more good comments elided]
Agreed. I concur with Tim's further comments, which I've omitted, on the
meaning of "Cypherpunks write code".  It's clear that the qualifications for
being a critic (in the constructive sense) of activity XYZ differ from the
requirements for doing XYZ, in the general case. This is the old "Oh, if
you're so smart, let's see you do it better" from elementary school. Absurd.
One of the primary sources of this dispute is, I think, the fact that c'punks
have widely divergent target markets in mind. I was rather surprised to
observe this at the last Bay Area physical meeting. Sandy moderated a
prognostication session on the future of cryptoanarchy, etc. Towards the end, he asked each person to offer his/her definition of "victory" in the
cryptoanarchic program. Some people were adamant that privacy would need to be
widely protected across society for them to consider the project a success.
Others essentially asserted that they'd be content with what I'll call "the
cypherpunk community" enjoying free access to privacy-preserving tools. The various *n*x crypto tools go a long way toward satisfying one market, yet
don't appear to help much with another market. So they constitute a "big win"
for some c'punks, while remaining largely irrelevant for others.
It would behoove c'punks on
all sides not to take umbrage at others' embracing different goals. It
would be great to hear persuasive arguments as to why "we" should adopt your
plan, but "we" are under no obligation to be convinced, or to place any
particular value on the achievement of aims we don't share with you.
The significant segregation of software developers and
software users onto different platforms makes the disunity of purpose much
more of an issue than it would be otherwise. A conscious effort must be exerted to ensure that tools developed for the cognoscenti ;) have a
chance to run on the machines owned by the rest of the multiverse. For my
money, this is the best feature of platform-independent languages, etc. Ideally, Java and such will afford me the opportunity to write code for, say,
the Macintosh, which could compete with native code, without my having to
break down and use a Mac (gag).
On a related note, this summer I've broken down and found myself developing
software in Tcl under VMS. (I'm typing this on a VAXstation 4000 VLC.) Bob
Snyder has recommended exmh here before, a highly MIME- and PGP-aware mailer
for *n*x which is apparently built with Tcl/Tk. Apart from the discussions
of possibly using Safe-Tcl for remailers, I haven't seen much talk of using
Tcl/Tk for crypto apps here. Can anyone point me in the direction of work on
this front, or towards reasons why Tcl/Tk seems like a poor choice ?  I'm
still pretty new to Tcl.

Correct. However, the excerpt of RFC 1750 you quoted above does not claim
that all PRNG techniques are unreasonably insecure, nor does it suggest that
they should never be used.
I agree with the RFC's authors that mandating provision of platform-
dependent routines is an awkward and unappealing strategy. Note, however,
that they characterize it as "the only safe strategy". They say that the
_strategy_ is error-prone; they do not say that all locally-supplied
routines are unreasonably insecure, and should not be used.   This is just a reiteration of the first section you quoted.

Where ?  Give a citation, please. It doesn't say anything of the sort in

In the context of RFC 1750, it appears to me that the phrase "truly random
hardware techniques" does not refer to the type of RNG method employed in
PGP. Section 5.3 discusses the use of built-in digitizers of analog natural
sources, and turbulence in disk drive chambers, as the "truly random" "existing hardware" techniques. Keystroke timing only seems to fall under

Large numbers of able people with good communications very recently exercised their putative "very real power" against the passage of the CDA. They had no
substantial impact AFAICS. (I intend no slur against the effort.)  Could you
name some examples, and add some qualifications that made the difference in
those cases ?
Just in case I'm one of those who "can no longer imagine what a nation is,
other than a nation state", you should perhaps define the term more
concretely. I guess The Nation of Islam might fit, or the worldwide
community of Palestinians.
OK, first of all I'm not convinced that the net qualifies as a "nation", but
it's hard to say until I better understand what you mean by "nation".
_Strong_ nationalism is a powerful force that governments often exploit to
their own considerable advantage, and indeed also brings down governments
in some cases. Offhand, it looks to me as though the USSR did a decent job
of withstanding various strong internal nationalistic forces for a long time, and was brought down mainly by other considerations.
Perhaps "often" is the case; from previous experience, I suspect your grasp of the relevant history is clearly superior to mine. (You have some great
stuff on your web pages.) I note that you did not claim "all".
OK, but govts. do indeed manage to muster plenty of cohesion in various
actions. I disagree, but assertions will get us nowhere.
Sure, but the govt. has been changed before and can change again.

Presumably The Chinese Wall (and many other gateways, routers, etc.) would

You will be pleased to hear that this problem was anticipated at least 15
years ago (in David Chaum's paper on "digital mixes"). Briefly, the solution
is to use multiple layers of encryption to distribute trust among several
remailer operators. Before it is remailed, a message is encrypted with public
keys belonging to each of a sequence of remailers. As each remailer receives
a message, it removes the outer layer of encryption using its private key,
revealing another encrypted message and the next address to which it should
be sent. Cooperation of all the remailers in the chain is needed to link the
originating address to the message that is eventually delivered to a recipient. For a longer exposition on the current state of the art in deployed
mail anonymizers, see Note that the availability of strong anonymity critically depends upon the
availability of strong cryptography. If the Department of the Treasury Automated Systems Division holds all the remailers' private keys, then it can
easily determine the originators of all anonymously remailed messages.

Future technical investigations of IPG would be greatly aided if you placed

What protects each user's one time pads ("PCX Nvelopes", or whatever) ?  Are they protected by an eight-character Unix account password ?  (This would be harder for implementations on traditionally single-user platforms like the

I'm not sure what you mean by "irregular" in this context.
This doesn't quite jibe with my understanding of the typical use of a hardware
RNG. From what I have read, one starts with an unpredictable bit source with
some known bias, so that each original bit has somewhat less than one bit of
real entropy. The bias is "corrected" by combining the original bits to get
fewer bits with enough real entropy, and then repeating the process enough to
get enough final bits of real entropy. Could you explain what the acronyms "ADC" and "LOB" mean here ?  I
just tried a web search for the two together, and all I got was a page of
UFO acronyms, and some astronomical acronyms (LOB = Lick Observatory Bulletin). Schneier discusses hardware RNG at length in Applied Cryptography,
but he doesn't mention either acronym. I might guess that LOB = Low Order

the crossover happens somewhere before N=4096. 2^4096 = 2^(16*256) > 2^(12*256) = (2^12)^256 = (4096)^256

ftp://rs.internic.net/policy/internic/internic-gen-1.txt says:
Thanks to Eric Eden for forwarding a copy to cypherpunks. I'd like to comment on the proposed set of authentication options (authorization schemes).
I realize this is meant to be the simplest/least-secure option. Nevertheless,
it seems to me that checking the "From " header instead of the "From:" header
would increase the security of this option at essentially no computational
cost. (I think "From " is commonly called "From_" in the literature these
days.) From_ is harder to forge than "From:", although that's not saying a
great deal.
Might I assume that the current InterNIC practice is to check "From:" ?
If so, you might consider switching to From_ in the interim, before the
Guardian Object stuff gets implemented.
I think that Unix's md5(1) would be a better transformation choice. It is available to a similar extent as crypt(3), and is more inversion-resistant.
I'm not sure how the speeds compare. What sort of volume of update messages does InterNIC anticipate handling ?  Also, if you use a hash function such as MD5, you don't need to fool around
with doing something like E_pass(pass). In Section 9.3, it says:
I certainly appreciate the sentiment expressed here that "security through
obscurity" is a wash. However, in this particular situation I don't think
that's the right issue. Keeping the details of a security algorithm or
protocol is rather dubious in many cases. But it's entirely reasonable and
good for a security protocol to specify that some sensitive application data handled by the protocol will be hidden. Encryption is, after all, a way to
hide information....
Let me wax concrete now. :} If a Guardian uses CRYPT-PW and the authentication
information appears in the public WHOIS database, then an attacker can learn
crypt(3)_KEY(pass) just by looking up the WHOIS entry. Assuming the Guardian isn't hassling with managing a distinct key to encrypt the password, then the
attacker knows crypt(3)_pass(pass). Now she is all set to do an offline
password guessing attack. So exposing the ciphertext of the encrypted password
introduces a weakness.
More importantly, the CRYPT-PW protocol is subject to a replay attack. A passive attacker just needs to eavesdrop on an update message to learn the plaintext password. Then she can forge additional update messages using the purloined password, causing annoyance to Guardians using AFTER-UPDATE
notification and disruption to those using NOT-CARE update notification (i.e. none). As far as I can see from the draft, the contact update templates do not
include date or time information. This makes the protocol vulnerable to a simple replay attack. An attacker can record update messages and replay
them to InterNIC later. Depending upon a Guardian's notification status, this could allow the attacker to confuse things by restoring an old contact information record. Even if a Guardian is using BEFORE-UPDATE, she might not notice that a
subtle change has been undone. An update notification message arriving on the heels of a similar one might get approved by a Guardian, who chalks it
up to a mail transport glitch.
Requiring some sort of timestamp field in the signed portion of the contact
templates would be good.
Any hints on what this will be like ?
Hope this helps. Feel free to ask questions.

Your description is a bit ambiguous. Do you really mean "readable", or
do you mean "verifiable" ?
If the former, it sounds like this could be handled by distributing signed certificates encrypted with the issuer's public key. If the latter, you could distribute signed certificates but not the public key
needed to verify the signatures on the certs.

attacks by removing sigs. from a cert., or substituting some certs. for
others, or stopping the delivery of some certs. If the keyserver signs
responses by default, then an ordinary active attacker (non-MITM) couldn't

Mixmaster, which includes its own set of crypto routines (currently using
RSA with 3DES as I recall), allows you to compile the private key passphrase
into the executable, and wipe out the source code. This obscures the
passphrase plaintext from (very) casual observers.  The fundamental problem AFAICS is the difficulty of getting a program to keep
a secret from an observer. If the program doesn't actually _use_ the secret

key), then it seems you can attain an arbitrary level of "security through
obscurity", because you can encode the secret however you want in the code.
But if a program is capable of possessing and using the secret without
human intervention, then anyone with a copy of the program can do the same.  Bottom line: if you can crack (say) the 8-character Unix passphrase for a

@_subject: Re: Request Comments: Transpose/XOR Hash 
My primary suggestion is that you do some reading in a good crypto text like
Applied Cryptography (2nd ed.). The introduction to PRZ's manual for PGP is
also particularly germane, as is the sci.crypt FAQ.
OK, since I'm procrastinating doing some non-crypto work right now, I looked
at your algorithm for 10 minutes or so. Your description is rather vague, so
I'm not sure I understand exactly what you're proposing. My best guess is:
The hash has 8 rounds. The initial 64-bit digest value is H = K. For notational convenience, let H[i] denote the i-th byte of H, and H[i,j] denote the j-th bit of H[i]. Juxtaposition denotes concatenation. I'll assume bit 1 is the MSB. You hash K by doing:
H = K
for k = 1 to 8 do
return H
First of all, this isn't even a good checksum, since the output depends on only 16 of the 64 input bits (namely the MSBs and LSBs of each byte of K).
Many pairs of output bits are highly correlated (in fact, equal).
H[2,1] == H[3,1] == ... == H[8,1] because H[1] doesn't change after the first round. Similarly H[1,8] == H[2,8] == ... == H[8,8] because H[8] doesn't
change until the end of the algorithm. For each other choice of bit index j, there's a "before" value H[1,j] == ... == H[j,j] and an "after" value
H[j+1,j] == ... == H[8,j].
This tells us that there are at most 2^(1 + 7*2) == 2^15 possible hash output values. But it would be faster to take advantage of the observation that for each j,
H[1,j] == K[j,1] xor K[j,8]. We guess the 8 LSBs as g_1, g_2, ..., g_8, and
compute the corresponding 8 MSBs as m_j = g_j xor H[1,j], which gives us all
the information we need to compute a hash value.
So we can compute a preimage of an arbitrary hash value with at most 2^8 = 256 guesses.
In any case, this is an extremely weak cryptographic hash.

 Modern cryptology researchers have been enthusiastically portrayed in the
 media as cyberspace's Freedom Fighters, and the fruit of their work, as
 tangible evidence that computers not only control, but can also liberate.
 In this seminar, we'll see how this simplistic picture of cryptological
 research shapes both the public perceptions of cryptology, and
 cryptologist's perceptions of themselves and their work.
 Jean-Francois Blanchette will discuss how the culture of secrecy and
 military intelligence has deeply informed the models cryptologists use to
 analyze and design security artifacts. He will also discuss how, from a
 initial concern with communication secrecy, cryptological research has
 dramatically expanded its scope to encompass digital signatures and
 certificates, watermarking, e-cash, copy-protection, and other domains.
 These are all artifacts of much broader cultural and societal import that
 can be fit under the analytical category of "privacy." Cryptologists, as
 well as the rest of us, have to imagine and invent richer and more complex
 representations of what cryptological research is about and what its
 object is, and to explore other social and ethical paradigms than those
 offered by privacy and confidentiality.
 Jean-Francois Blanchette is a graduate student in the Department of
 Science, Technology and Society at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
 Trained as a cryptologist, he is now researching and writing about the
 practices, cultures, and ethics of cryptology.
