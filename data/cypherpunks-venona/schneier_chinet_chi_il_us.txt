This is from Bart Preneel's Ph.D. thesis, "Analysis and Design of
Cryptographic Hash Functions," Jan 1993, p. 191.  It is about the
cryptanalysis of MD5:
    B. den Boer noted that an approximate relation exists between
    any four consecutive additive constants.  Moreover, together
    with A. Bosselaers he developed an attack that produces
    pseudo-collisions, more specifically they can construct two
    chaining variables (that only differ in the most significant
    bit of every word) and a single message block that yield the
    same hashcode.  The attack takes a few minutes on a PC.  This
    means that one of the design principles behind MD4 (and MD5),
    namely to design a collision resistant function is not satisfied.
I have not seen the actual paper yet, which will be presented at
Eurocrypt.  Both PEM and PGP rely on MD5 for a secure one-way hash
function.  This is troublesome, to say the least.

Following is a short note commenting on den Boer and Bosselaers'
recent work on the MD5 message-digest algorithm. Feel free to email
