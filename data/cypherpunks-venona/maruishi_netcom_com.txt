I was trying to think of a way to come up with true random numbers...
And knowing a bit of UNIX socket TCP/IP programming I made a small little
program that generates random numbers by measuring the mili-second timing ies a TCP packet to bounce back, from another network.   My program simply send some data to port 7 (echo port) of a network on an internal list. Then timing it, randomly picks a different network to send to.  I was wondering if this would be helpful to anyone for generating random key or whatever.
If you want the source code please post a request or e-mail me. If you think for some reason that using this method is a bad idea, I would like to know.

I think you are probably right when you say that it is not truely random.
I don't think I thought about it very much, but this method does produce
a kind of a pseudo random numbers.     But I think it would be really hard to simulate this method because
if you send data to a network way out there in Europe then all the machines in between can cause the tranmission to slow down or spend up
depending on the type of lines nad CPU load etc...
    There are so many variables that although this may not "random", it
"appears" to have a good engough entropy and I don't think there is a cycle or period, at least none that I can notice.

Although using other networks probably isn't as safe as using your own LAN,
If you send the packets across the US then there are more variables to
determine time they took to get back. This is obviously becuase each
and every machine in between well vary in speed, line connections etc...
And the timing even on the same machine well change, because of CPU laod
Maybe another "random" source XORed with this?
I don't know, just a though.

@_subject: pseudo random: THE CODE 
Here is the code. Its pretty quick and dirty.
          NET_NUM 1/*change this to the number of networks in
struct timezone tz;
struct sockaddr_in addr;
unsigned int bits;
main(int argc, char **argv)
struct timeval tv;
register FILE *fin, *key, *nets;
int sock, c, dt, i, net;
unsigned char *packet;
unsigned char ch;
if(argc != 3)
printf("Usage: %s [key.file.path] [number of bits in key]\n", argv[0]);
} net = 1;
packet = (unsigned char *)malloc(16);/*you can of course change this value*/
memset(packet, "X", 16);
bits = atoi(argv[2]);
bits = bits / 8; /*how many bytes?*/
char *getn(int num)
char *nets[] = return nets[num];
struct timeval *tp;
tvsub(out, in)
register struct timeval *out, *in;

Thanks for all the information. Thanks for everyones insightful comments.
