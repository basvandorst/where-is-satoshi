@_subject: RPK Encryptonite engine 
Hello people,
Just wondering if anyone could pull a word on RPK crypto. They say they
built their engine based on  Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange principles (which
shoulds safe enough), but they claim their software doesn't fail under US
crypto restriction law, which makes me suspicious.
