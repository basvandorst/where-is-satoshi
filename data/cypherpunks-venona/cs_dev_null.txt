If email not encrypted to a Korrect Kompany Key is filtered 'from'
the recipient's mbox, I imagine it would also be filtered 'to' another
mbox, for signs of suspicious activity.
 e.g. - an encrypted message to the CEO of the company from   "Corporate_Spy with a subject heading such as,
  "Information received--money deposited to your account."
  Of course, if the message enclosed was a bunch of garbage, encrypted
to the CEO's private key, and then slightly corrupted, then that would
make it all the more suspicious, interesting, wouldn't it?
  Not that you're a troublemaker...
