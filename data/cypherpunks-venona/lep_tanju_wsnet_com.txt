I've gotten the gate up, but still working a few bugs out. Cypherpunks are welcome to use it but if it is abused, I will have to remove general Until I can write a script to pull all the newsgroups from the active file and place aliases for them in sendmail, the only way to use it is via a Newsgroups: header. The address is mail2news
Let me know any bugs you may find.

@_subject: PGPfone and (?) boxes 
A couple of months ago, the release of PGPfone got the list started on hardware alternatives to PTN encryption... An associate of mine recently returned from the Consumer Electronics show in Hong Kong and broght me a lot of stuff including a flyer for a telephone scrambler.
From the flyer:
Secure your telephone conversations through high-tech scrambling.
Never again be concerned with eavesdroppers!
With our state of the art Telephone Scrambler you can now discuss confidential business and/or personal matters over the public telephone network without worrying about eavesdroppers. This compact and easy to install unit renders taps and monitors useless by way of rolling code encryption. Eavesdroppers will hear nothing but gibberish, ensuring complete privacy for all your telephone conversations. The Telephone Scrambler allows you to set your own unique code ensuring that only you and the party that you are speaking with can decode the conversation. Two units are required -- one for each end of the conversation.
o One-touch scrambling
o Thousands of key combinations
o "Rollig code" scrambling
o Works with Tone or Pulse
o Easy connection
o LED display
o FCC registered
o Compact and Portable
Power: 12 VDC
Dimensions: 5 1/2" X 3" X 1"
Weight: 6 oz
PTN Connection: USOC TJ-11C
Keys: 2^12
Company is:
P3 Personal Protection Products

(212) 421-5024 Fax
Well, in itself it isn't very impressive. However, I plan on giving them a call tomorrow and check prices. If they aren't that bad I'll get one and pull it apart. Perhaps it can be at least reprogrammed for more keys and another encryption algo. Hell, at 2^12 keys, all it takes is a few seconds to find which one the conversation is using.
