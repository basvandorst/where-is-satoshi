Oooh.  I don't know about a good idea.  I was never much in favor
of giving my name out for free.  I mean if someone want's to read this
list and find my affiliation from the sporadic posts that I enter and
then make random associations about me that is one thing.
But to do it for them?  Nahhh, that is part of the reason I entertain
ideas like cryptography, and practices like only withdrawing my money
from one bank in person while writing out of state checks for all
mail purposes.  I'd just rather that people didn't know my business.
Thus, personally, I think it is "a bad idea".

[rather clever way of using peoples sigs to  map anonymous users to their real logins deleted]
I will take this to be the final affirmation that
.sig files are one of the worst ideas on the network.
I do not use them and sign each piece of mail personally.
Of course this is oft times automatic, but hey maybe now
I'll quit that entirly now.
