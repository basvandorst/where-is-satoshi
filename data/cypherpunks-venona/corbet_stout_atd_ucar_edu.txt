 they are - and I haven't tried checking their
articles to know what to look for to check whether an email
request claiming to be from one of them looks unforged.
If I remember right, none of these people puts a PGP Key ID or fingerprint
in their posting signatures, so I don't have that clue available -
that would increase my confidence a lot.  But I still couldn't be sure.
[This is the hitch in digital signatures isn't it?  At least as far as
those not issued from an authority are concerned.  You are really
signing for a location rather than anything else.  You have no idea
who has access to the secret key on the other side of the public or if
the "who" is a "him" a "her" or "they."  A signature is webbed in with
the trust you give it.  Tim May's signature means nothing if everyone
knows that Tim and his close friends all use it even if the key only
has the words "Tim May" on it.
++ Tim, I used your name because I want someone else to be the example
today  :) ++
Technically (for you grassy knoll types) the holder of a secret key could
be quite dead and anyone might have taken up use.
The dead key holder, or even the duress key holder, creates all
sorts of problems if you are dealing with nym's or anonymous keys.
Same problem with so-called "password" or "bearer" accounts.
The money is only as secure as the protocol is secret.  Subjectively
different for each and every user.
People like LD have to break past the barrier in concept and accept
that a public key system with an open trust web just cannot be used
to establish IDENTITY.  With a properly structured web it approaches
zero probability of "identity fraud," but never quite gets there.
I'm not lying if I sign some key that I know to belong to a person
who actively uses the name "564FR"
All my signature says is that "at one time 564FR held this key and
I trust him to send a revocation if there is a problem."
"This key is held by 564FR and 564FR alone, so help me (insert deity of
Frankly I think this system is a lot MORE honest than a centralized
system (which stinks to me of big government anyhow) because
multiple signatures from several individuals represent different
perspectives on identity.  Chances are that if you have 6 nice signatures
you managed to convince 6 very different people that the key is "yours"
I trust this much more than some "trusted authority" which is likely
to be neither trusted, nor an authority.]
On the other hand, if I really cared about preserving the anonymity
of the nym-user, and it was somebody I knew in person, or myself,
I probably wouldn't sign it with my real key - it may be relatively obvious
that "Bill The Dragon-Basher" whose key was signed by "Bill Stewart" was me,
but I'd rather not have to deal with a court subpoena or Mafia equivalent
trying to find the users of the keys for "Crypto International, Ltd." or
"Coalition Against the U.S. Invasion of Cuba" or "Some Unapproved Religion" or
"Bear's Custom Chemicals" or an anonymous Panamanian bank account that's mine.
But if the keys are only signed by other nyms, how trustable are they?
[So how do you know what's a nym and what's not?]
If I ran a digibank, I'd be real hesitant about accepting changes of
address or public-key unless I had some physical verification or other
securely shared secret to avoid eavesdropper and interloper attacks,
but one of the goals of digital banking is that you're not supposed
to need physical transactions.  I suppose an initial account set up
by sending the bank a message with a Secret and a public key and a
bunch of digibucks might do the job, with some cut&choose protocols
to decrypt the digibucks if the account is approved?
[If I ran a digibank with open accounts, I'd shift the security burden
to the account holder.  Especially when dealing with accounts from
sketchy identities.  Provide the means for security in protocol,
the rest is up to the user.]

The January 10 issue of the New Yorker has an amusing article about the

from the point of view of this list, is the quote from one of Gates's
Neither Gates nor the New Yorker author (John Seabrook) seems aware that
messages from 73124.1524 to billg travel in

a newbie discovering the pleasures of email, so he can be forgiven for not
questioning the above statement.  Gates should know better.  Even if
security within microsoft.com is absolute, which seems unlikely to me.
Actually, the whole article shows a sort of awe of "Bill" that, from my
unix-oriented perspective, I really can not share.  But it's an interesting
read anyway.  The New Yorker is showing a surprising willingness to delve

Anyway, you want to read the newsgroup comp.risks; you can find the
particular digest by looking at the subject lines.
And, what the heck...for those of you who can't or don't want to to into
comp.risks, here is the article.  Enjoy.
CPSR has announced a petition campaign to oppose the Clipper initiative.  I
would like to caution people about signing the petition.  The issues are
extremely complex and difficult.  The Clipper initiative is the result of
considerable deliberation by many intelligent people who appreciate and
understand the concerns that have been expressed and who worked hard to
accommodate the conflicting interests.  The decisions that have been made were
not made lightly.
I would like to respond to some of the statements that CPSR has made
about Clipper in their campaign and petition letters:
     The Clipper proposal, developed in secret by the National Security
     Agency, is a technical standard that will make it easier for
     government agents to wiretap the emerging data highway.
The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any other high
speed computer network.  It is for the telephone system.  Quoting from FIPS
185: "Data for purposes of this standard includes voice, facsimile and
computer information communicated in a telephone system.  A telephone system
for purposes of this standard is limited to a system which is circuit switched
and operating at data rates of standard commercial modems over analog voice
circuits or which uses basic-rate ISDN or a similar grade wireless service."
The standard will not make it any easier to tap phones, let alone
computer networks.  All it will do is make it technically possible to
decrypt communications that are encrypted with the standard, assuming
the communications are not superencrypted with something else.  Law
enforcers still need to get a court order just to intercept the
communications in the first place, and advances in technology have made
interception itself more difficult.  The standard will make it much
harder for anyone to conduct illegal taps, including the government.
The purpose of the standard is to provide a very strong encryption algorithm -
something much stronger than DES - and to do so in a way that does not thwart
law enforcement and national security objectives.  Keys are escrowed so that
if someone uses this technology, they cannot use it against national
     Industry groups, professional associations and civil liberties
     organizations have expressed almost unanimous opposition to the
     plan since it was first proposed in April 1993.
     "The public does not like Clipper and will not accept it ..."
     The private sector and the public have expressed nearly unanimous
     opposition to Clipper.  As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has conducted any
systematic poll of industry, professional societies, or the public.  While
many people have voiced opposition, there are many more organizations and
people who have been silent on this issue.  The ACM is in the process of
conducting a study on encryption.  CPSR is a member of the study group, as am
I.  Steve Kent is chair.  Our goal is a report that will articulate the
issues, not a public statement either for or against.  The International
Association for Cryptologic Research has not to my knowledge made any official
statement about Clipper.
     The Administration ignored the overwhelming opposition of the
     general public. When the Commerce Department solicited public
     comments on the proposal last fall, hundreds of people opposed the
     plan while only a few expressed support.
Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a population of 250 million,
especially when most of the letters were the same and came in through the net
following a sample letter that was sent out.
     The technical standard is subject to misuse and compromise. It
     would provide government agents with copies of the keys that
     protect electronic communications. "It is a nightmare for computer
     security."
I have been one of the reviewers of the standard.  We have completed our
review of the encryption algorithm, SKIPJACK, and concluded it was very
strong.  While we have not completed our review of the key escrow system, from
what I have seen so far, I anticipate that it will provide an extremely high
level of security for the escrowed keys.
     The underlying technology was developed in secret by the NSA, an
     intelligence agency responsible for electronic eavesdropping, not
     privacy protection. Congressional investigations in the 1970s
     disclosed widespread NSA abuses, including the illegal
     interception of millions of cables sent by American citizens.
NSA is also responsible for the development of cryptographic codes to protect
the nation's most sensitive classified information.  They have an excellent
track record in conducting this mission.  I do not believe that our
requirements for protecting private information are greater than those for
protecting classified information.  I do not know the facts of the 1970s
incident that is referred to here, but it sounds like it occurred before
passage of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  This act requires
intelligence agencies to get a court order in order to intercept
communications of American citizens.  I am not aware of any recent evidence
that the NSA is engaging in illegal intercepts of Americans.
     Computer security experts question the integrity of the
     technology.  Clipper was developed in secret and its
     specifications are classified.
The 5 of us who reviewed the algorithm unanimously agreed that it was very
strong.  We will publish a final report when we complete or full evaluation.
Nothing can be concluded from a statement questioning the technology by
someone who has not seen it regardless of whether that person is an expert in
     NSA overstepped its legal authority in developing the standard.  A
     1987 law explicitly limits the intelligence agency's power to set
     standards for the nation's communications network.
The 1987 Computer Security Act states that NIST "shall draw on the technical
advice and assistance (including work products) of the National Security
     There is no evidence to support law enforcement's claims that new
     technologies are hampering criminal investigations. CPSR recently
     forced the release of FBI documents that show no such problems.
CPSR obtained some documents from a few FBI field offices.  Those offices
reported no problems.  CPSR did not get reports from all field offices and did
not get reports from local law enforcement agencies.  I can tell you that it
is a fact that new communications technologies, including encryption, have
hampered criminal investigations.  I personally commend law enforcement for
trying to get out in front of this problem.
     If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that hope to develop
     new products will face extensive government obstacles.
     Cryptographers who wish to develop new privacy enhancing
     technologies will be discouraged. The standard is voluntary -- even for the government.
     Mr. Rotenberg said "We want the public to understand the full
     implications of this plan.  Today it is only a few experts and
     industry groups that understand the proposal. I support this objective.  Unfortunately, it is not possible for most of us to
be fully informed of the national security implications of uncontrolled
encryption.  For very legitimate reasons, these cannot be fully discussed and
debated in a public forum.  It is even difficult to talk about the full
implications of encryption on law enforcement.  This is why it is important
that the President and Vice-President be fully informed on all the issues, and
for the decisions to be made at that level.  The Feb. 4 decision was made
following an inter-agency policy review, headed by the National Security
Council, that examined these issues using considerable input from industry,
CPSR, EFF, and individuals as well as from law enforcement and intelligence
agencies.  In the absence of understanding the national security issues, I
believe we need to exercise some caution in believing that we can understand
the full implications of encryption on society.
As part of the Feb. 4 announcement, the Administration announced the
establishment of an Interagency Working Group on Encryption and
Telecommunications, chaired by the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy and National Security Council, with representatives from
Commerce, Justice, State, Treasury, FBI, NSA, OMB, and the National Economic
Council.  The group is to work with industry and public interest groups to
develop new encryption technologies and to review and refine encryption
policy.  The NRC's Computer Science and Telecommunications Board will also be
conducting a study of encryption policy.

@_subject: Spread encryption with telnet? 
The current furor over people with password sniffers on the Internet made
me think of another possible option for spreading the use of encryption on
the net.  As everbody knows, the problem is with the passing of plaintext
passwords over the net.  Get rid of these passwords, and the crackers have
to go back to the other 99999 ways of breaking into machines.
It couldn't be very hard to grab a version of telnet and telnetd off the
net and hack in some sort of encryption of the data stream.  Heck, you
could just use the vendor's DES library on systems that have it -- perhaps
not the most aesthetic solution, but easy.  Put in a negotiation option so
that encryption will be used when both ends support it, and you have
instant plug-in relatively secure telnet.
As a bonus, you get your whole session encrypted, not just the password.
It seems like it could be much easier to install than, say, kerberos, and
offer more security.  I would guess that if you made something like this
available and EASY, that lots of people would install it on their machines.
Folks are a little nervous right now, and a sniff-proof telnet might make
them feel better.
If I made a telnet that simply hooked into a vendor's encryption library,
with no internal encryption code, would I have ITAR problems still?  That
may be moot, since any vendor encryption library almost certainly will not
address the problem of coming up with a session key, so probably some sort
of key exchange protocol would have to be put in.
Overall, this seems easy and useful enough that I'm amazed that nobody has
done it yet.  Have I missed something?

@_subject: Another clipper editorial 
The following appeared as an unsigned editorial in the 2/14 Christian
Science Monitor.  It lacks the fire of Safire's piece, but it's nice to see
CLIPPING PRIVACY
With the rise of electronic mail, public data networks, and cordless and
cellular phones has come a rise in devices to encode data to protect the
users' privacy.  But law enforcement officials worry that these advances
will undercut their ability to secretly gather evidence through wiretaps
and other surveillance methods.
To respond to law enforcement's need, the Clinton administration reportedly
is seeking a bill that would require phone and cable companies to use
software designed to allow law enforcement agencies to monitor phone and
data transmissions.  Earlier this month, the administration decided to push
federal agencies to include so-called Clipper Chips in computers and phones
they use.  If that extends to vendors and contractors, the chip may become
a de facto industry standard.  The chips were designed in conjunction with
the National Security Agency to permit unscrambling of coded data
transmissions.  These moves represent potential dangers to privacy; they take on added
urgency with the imminent marriage of computers, phones, and cable services
in ways that reduce the diversity of people's means of communication even
as they use those means for more activities.  No one doubts the need for
effective law enforcement.  The government, however, should not be in the
business of asking manufacturers to build secret backdoors into their
equipment, particularly when government holds the keys.  The proposals also
raise questions as to how appealing United States technology exports will
be overseas if such backdoor access is built in.
Congress should take a hard look at any bill that tries to expand the
government's ability to peer through the electronic blinds, no matter how
well-meaning the motive.
