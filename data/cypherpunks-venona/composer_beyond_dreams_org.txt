Sure thing.  Perhaps those of us from the Boston area that'll be at CFP-3
should get together while we're there next week to plan something in Boston.
A sort of pre-meeting.. ;-)

White House and NSA (Encryption) Clipper Chip Announcement
On April 16, 1993, the White House announced the development of an
encryption chip for voice communications developed in conjunction
with the National Security Agency (NSA) called the Clipper Chip, along
with an initiative regarding telecommunications and privacy which
could literally affect almost every citizen in the United States.
On the same day, AT&T announced a "secure" phone which incorporated
this chip.  Some important things to point out:
    o the encryption algorithm is remaining classified
      [ In the cryptography community, an encryption algorithm is only
    o though the government has announced plans to use the chip in their
      own phones, they do NOT plan to use it for CLASSIFIED information,
      only for unclassified information.
    o this chip has been in the making for 4 years; it would seem that
      the Clinton Administration has already made plans to use the chip,
      without public comment or discussion on a matter which is so
      important to the privacy of that same public.
    o it would seem that the Government might be granting a monopoly to
      Mykotronx, Inc. and VLSI Technology.  It's unclear whether each
      company makes the entire chip or just parts thereof.
    o the key, which allows the information encrypted with this chip to
      be decrypted, is embedded in the chip
      [ This means that once the key is known, the chip needs to be
    o the 80-bit key is split into two (2) 40-bit pieces and kept in
      databases at two different escrow agencies
      [ It's not clear how the key databases will be kept secure.  It
    o a successor chip has already been announced, called the Capstone
      chip.  The Capstone chip is supposed to be a "superset" of the
      Clipper chip and will include the "digital signature standard" (DSS),
      which many in the cyprotgraphy community seem to consider insecure,
      as I recall.  The NSA also developed DSS, which wasn't disclosed
      until CPSR filed a FOIA request with NIST (the National Institute of
      Standards & Technology).
This announcement, in one way, is a step in the right direction -- privacy
and encryption technology are important to the general public and for
international economic competitiveness.  An inquiry on whether export
restrictions on encryption technology is good or bad is also a good thing.
Currently, companies that want to include encryption as part of their
products need to make two versions -- one for domestic distribution and one
for international distribution.
On the other hand, there are too many things about the announcement which
are bothersome and need to be discussed publicly.  Some of these items
have been mentioned above.  I recommend talking with your local
congressman, writing letters, and discussing this with friends.
Both the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) have made public statements
against the announcement.  The CPSR has filed Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) requests regarding the plan.
Online discussions of the announcement have been occurring all over the
Net in various USENET newsgroups and mailing lists.  Here's a sample of

------- Forwarded Message
ON-LINE/OFF-LINE DIGITAL SIGNATURES
Shimon Even
Computer Science Department
Technion - Israel Institute of Technology
Joint work with Oded Goldreich and Silvio Micali
A signature scheme is proposed. It consists of two phases. The
first phase is performed off-line, before the message to be signed
is even known. The second on-line phase is performed once the message
to be signed is known. The scheme has a practical advantage as well as a
theoretical value.
It is shown that the on-line phase can be carried out very quickly,
by using a one-time signature scheme. The off-line phase can use a
simplified version of the square extraction method of Rabin. It
requires a moderate amount of computation, but can be performed
leisurely, before the message to be signed is even known. Thus, the
scheme may be of practical value in scenarios such as that of
electronic fund transfer.
It is proved that if the building blocks are secure against known
message attack, the scheme is secure against chosen message attack.
There will be tea at 10:45.

Really?  That's odd, especially for a unix box, which access.digex.com
seems to be.  And, as a matter of fact, it does seem to show "Robert
Stratton" for the username of "strat".  So, it seems they do maintain
username to "real name" mappings (even if they allow the user to change
the "real name" listed.

I think you're jumping to (incorrect, IMO) conclusions here.  All that
was said was that an organization (the FBI, in this case) bought a USENET
feed.  Yes, distribution on tapes is still a feed of sorts (albeit a slow
one with a bursty latency ;-).  There is nothing wrong with that, as it
is one of the services which UUNET Technologies provides.
There is NO REASON to believe or even assume that UUNET Technologies is
archiving other non-publically available communications, such as e-mail,

Sure, question it.  But, also look into the problem from a real technical
standpoint first, instead of just jumping to conclusions.  Talk to the
people you're attempting to communicate with -- maybe it's a problem on
their end.  Talk to your communications provider.. or maybe it's a
problem somewhere along the path you're communicating through.  Always
check potential technical problems before jumping to (probably unfounded
and paranoid) conclusions.  [I'm not saying you shouldn't keep them in
mind, as you should always consider all scenarios when trying to track
down a problem.  But, they should be in the background, not the
foreground, at first.]
I've just watched too many people jump to the conclusion that whatever
problem was occurring was being done purposely to them.. NOT that it
could just be a technical glitch... when, is WAS just a technical
problem.  Usually, it's just a technical problem that needs to be

But, the discussion previously WAS referring to USENET.  When you speak
publically, you don't assume that it's private.  So, in that context,
you're not speaking of privacy rights violations.

I haven't seen any indication of deceptions.  Unless, of course, you're
referring to mentioning that the FBI is/was a customer.  But, then, I
(and anyone else) can find out most UUNET customers who have USENET
newsfeeds very easily just by looking through the USENET maps.  So, I
don't see that as much of a problem, as long as they're not providing
other customer details.  I trust UUNET's staff on maintaining that
privacy, knowing some of them personally.

Which is understandable, though I don't believe your e-mail has been
compromised from what I've seen posted on cypherpunks.
Just some thoughts on the matter...

It's a scheduled downtime.  They're moving the machines from Cambridge, MA
