OK--so what about those of us who use MacPGP 2.3? Is there a new version 2.5
for Mac? If so where do I get it if I can't ftp to a site (sorry
folks...don't hate me 'cause I don't have full Net access (yet!!))...

Good morning all--
Can anyone direct me to a BBS which has a copy of WinPGP?

@_subject: MacPGP for PowerPC 
Two questions for you this morning:
1-Does anyone know what is going on re: the development of a version of
MacPGP for the PowerPC? Although the exisitng version does work, I am looking
for a native code version.
2-With the recent announcement by MIT, is there any development of a version
2.5 for Mac...680x0 or PPC?

Does anyone have any info on whether or not this new version will be
available for Macs? How about for PowerPC Macs?

Greetings all--
I have been reading the list for a couple of months now and have come across
the names of two people who seen to stir some very serious passions, David
Sternlight, & L. Detweiller.
Can someone tell me who they are and why C'punks hold them in such low
