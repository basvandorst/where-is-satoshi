Bzzt!  Try Again.  If you use bc, you will notice that 9^2 mod 35 == 11
and 8^2 mod 35 == 29...  You should go take your number theory class!
Yes.  It is the multiplicative inverse.  This is very basic math.  Go
re-read your 7th-grade algebra book:
Take your number theory class, and if you can't figure out after that,
re-ask the questions.
