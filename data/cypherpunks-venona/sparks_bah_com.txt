Well, with the UCMJ ( Uniform Code of Military Justice ) and the Oath of
Allegiance Military Personnel take on induction being re-written to Support
and defend the United Nations and to accept direct and lawful orders from UN
personnel, this doesn't surprise me.Soon, UN Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, or someone like him will repeal more of the amendments to our
constitution.  First our guns, then our code. I'll give up my pass phrase when
 they pry it from my cold dead fingers !

@_subject: Questions from a Wannabe 
Hi all, I have been reading all of the posts for a few days now and I have a couple
of questions, if someone has time.
In the event of GAk, how can we be forced to register our keys ?  We could
always scrounge some old outdated but functional TEMPEST equipment ....
and could someone please explain ITAR in a simple way for me ?
One last thing.. If I have the US PGP and a friend uses the export version,
I assume we are compatible, yes ?
Thanks all, Charles E. Sparks    In God we trust, all others we encrypt !

Only outlaws will have books...
Just watching the news here in Fl. and they are trying to hold a publisher
responsible for a murder because they published a fictional account of a
hitman and a guy says he used the book to kill some people.
Would you give your 6 year old a book ?
This is really getting out of hand.. Anyone have any property for sale in
Idaho ?

@_subject: Public and Private Munitions 
Morning all, I'm only on the second cup.......
- From what I gather, is someone took PGP and ... say Private
Idaho ( examples only, please ) and put then in a cute box with
the instructions printed out and sold it in a store, the
government couldn't control it ? So, why doesn't someone round
up a couple of nice shareware front ends , and the rest of ot,
put it in an envelope and sell it for $5.00 US. The buyer would
then have to pay the shareware fee, and the balance after the
packaging could go into escrow for the legal defense fund of
Cypherpunks or to Phil ?
Another note on GAK
One morning King Arthur and his knights set forth on a quest.
Lancelot, feeling poorly, was left behind. Arthur stopped to see
Lancelot on his way out and entrusted him with the key to
Gwenevere's (sp) chastity belt. ( Lancelot being a true and
faithful knight )  As the band made it's way about a mile from
the castle, a knight happened to see a rider from the castle,
riding for all he was worth. Tha king called a halt to wait for
the rider. It was Lancelot... breathlessly he said to the king,
sire, thou has given me the wrong key.....

@_subject: A Libertine Question 
My opinions are just that, MINE but here's a question ..
In the event that drugs are legalized like alcohol ( also a drug
) and tobacco and cafeine, who will take responsibility for
housing and feeding those, who are now blameless, individuals
who can't or won't take responsibility for themselves and work
or whatever. With freedom and liberty come a lot of
responsibility. Too many people today balme every damn thing in
the world for their problems -  and get away with it....
1. My grear grand parents were slaves, I suffer because of that,
so I killed 30 White people.
2. My momma didn't give me no tit so I raped those women and
killed them
and on, and on...............

@_subject: Pronto Mailer 
I use Pronto Mail also. I just started using it yesterday. I can honestly say that it makes things simpler... no cutting, pasting, decrypting, encrypting...and on and on. It is the sweetest mailer since Ishmail ( UNIX I will be able to use Pronto in my effort to proselytize the cause. The only thing I see that will prevent a lot of folks from getting it ( and paying for it ) is the price. $300 US seems a bit steep to some. I am going to pay for it because of the time it saves me. I would like to see a few things added, though. Multiple address books, keyed and non-keyed ( this might speed up the address book or add a search ( I have several hundred members of my firm listed in my Eudora mailer ). I'd also like to see some sort of IMAP address book support ( like Simeon or Z Mail ), These would also be accessable seperately in the interest of spped, since the pubring would be on each users machine.
With the C2 option in the NT Resource kit, I'd like an explanation on using Pronto with NT 4. I tried all sorts of things and had no luck after installing.. Pronto kept telling me the pifs were no good, couldn't find keys, etc...
None the less, I love it so far.. Just have to get the MC down a bit to pay for it ( That;s why it's a 60 day demo )

Nicely Put !!  I. for one, love it... warts ( for now ) and all !
Unicorn, please try to take a minute to think before hitting that send
You infer that a product is critically flawed without even trying it ?
There are quite a few members of this list who are using Pronto Secure
and will testify to the contrary.
See  for a list of people who take
the trouble to try out a product before venturing an opinion.
Agreed that feedback from external testers is a good deal for
developers. It is also not a bad deal for evaluators, they get a free
copy of a product which in the case of Pronto Secure many find useful
(as witnessed by x-mailer headers on c'punk traffic). Testers also get
an opportunity to contribute neat feature ideas which helps propagate
secure messaging to the masses.
Unicorn, you are invited to whitewash my fence :)
