@_subject: NYTimes web cookies 
It doesn't check the PW or ID at all except the first time you log in.
After that it generates a new cookie titled NPLCNYT and that is the only
cookie it checks; the PW and ID are not required to be there at all.
If you delete the NPLCNYT cookie, it will check the PW/ID and generate
a new one.  An example cookie is below:
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^|||||
The characters marked ^^^ appear to be random, and change every time a new
cookie is generated.  The ones marked  appear to encode the originating
IP address, and ||||| appears to be date/time.  The rest don't seem to change
(tho I only tried ID=cypherpunks PW=cypherpunks).  The server will still
accept the cookie if your IP address changes.
There does seem to be some sort of checksum on the data.  While the
relatively small area it uses to store the time and IP address wouldn't seem
to leave much room for this, I wasn't able to find a spoofed cookie that it
would accept - perhaps the checksum is included in the 'random' part.
