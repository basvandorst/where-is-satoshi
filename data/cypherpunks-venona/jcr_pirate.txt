So, the question is:  Anyone have any suggestions as to how one
could obtain documentation that would pass muster with the local
passport office?  I'm hoping to help her obtain the documentation

BTW, she was born a US citizen in Puerto Rico.  Baptismal records
may be forthcoming, but that isn't certain.
