^^^^^^
Brute force = exhaustive search.  Therefore, if there is a solution, and
the search terminates, the answer will be found.  Your point was, can an
encryption system be designed such that an exhaustive search yields
multiple equally good, different (preferably contradictory) decryptions,
for any given encrypted message.
In "Communications Theory of Secrecy Systems", Bell Systems Technical
Journal, Vol 28, pp. 656-715, Shannon measures the efficacy of an
encryption system by the average number of plaintext messages that map to
an arbitrary cyphertext (via different keys).  Later, Hellman (in "An
Extension of the Shannon Theory Approach to Cryptography", IEEE
Transactions on Information Theory, vol 23, No. 3, pp. 289-284) emphasized
Shannon's point about using compression with encryption so that decryption
will yield more false positives.  Ross Williams discusses this in his book:
"Adaptive Data Compression".
Note the limited definition of meaningful in these papers as 'makes words'.
 Given sufficient context, a correct decryption would not be able to hide
in a forest of 'meaningul' false positives.  (e.g. "Hmmmm, do you think
it's 'cats often enjoy', or 'be ready by tuesday').
Of course, a one time pad affords a very large space of meaningful (much
more meaningful than just 'makes words') decryptions for each encryption,
hence its information-theoretically perfect security.
A system which provides arbitrary mappings at the message level and no
derivable component context enjoys this property as well.  (e.g. a code
book: 1-->be ready by tuesday; 2-->expect a guest.  What does the message
'1' mean?  It can mean any message in the world, exactly as (when using a
one time pad) the 17th character might mean any character in the world.)
So in answer to your question: yes, a one time pad is just such a system.

@_subject: REMAIL: policy 
What follows is the policy for the remailer running at catalyst
as of 21 Sept 1993:
  - 1 -  I don't normally keep logs because (a) I lack the time to examine
         them; (b) I lack the space to keep them; and (c) frankly, I would
         rather _not_ know.  If some exceptional situation requires it, I
         will temporarily log to resolve that situation.
  - 2 -  I will block remailing to a given address on request and proof of
         identity by the owner.  I run a remailer because I believe privacy
         is an inaliable human right.  However, "Your right to swing your
         fist ends where my nose begins!".  I will not condone, promote or
         aid the violation of other human rights in the name of privacy.
         Because I don't keep logs, I can do no more than block (nor would
         I wish to), although, see - 1 -.
  - 3 -  I do not own the machine my remailer is running on.  In fact it is
         a commercial system.  Be nice.  If they ask me to stop running my
         remailer on their system... I will.  Additionally, you implicitly
         accept all the risks associated with trusting somebody elses machine.
  - 4 -  I don't read mail that goes through my remailer _BUT_ it is my
         personal account, and personal mail addressed to me passes through it,
         therefore, if a message doesn't look like it contains remailer
         commands, the remailer assumes it must be to me and I get it.
         I read all mail that is addressed to me.  The consequence is that
         poorly addressed messages intended to be remailed will be read by me.
         I will throw these messages away without responding, correcting, or
         forwarding them, as soon as I realize they were to have been remailed.
         Be aware that this can happen.  I'm sure there is some threshold
         beyond which the content would force me to action in some way.  What
         the content, threshold and possible actions are, I do not know.
         Protect yourself from this result by using multiple remailers and
         encrypting at each stage.
  - 5 -  I am an engineer.  I like to play.  I probably cannot stop myself
         from constantly tweaking and growing the remailer code.  It is,
         after all, an expermental system.  The remailer you use today may
         not be the same one you get tomorrow.
  - 6 -  I am a human being and suffer from all the associated frailties.
         When someone points a gun (actually or metaphorically) at me or my
         family, I must almost certainly comply with that entities wishes.
         I do NOT advocate law breaking and will comply with the law to the
         extent required and enforced; e.g., if the FBI comes to my door and
         says: "start logging your remailer, or shut it down" ("shut it down"
         might only be inferred ), then
         it is likely that I will comply to the extent required and enforced.
  - 7 -  As with my kids: I reserve the right to change the rules at any time
         and for any reason; though I seldom exercise this right to explicitly
         revoke previously explicitly granted freedoms.
  - 8 -  I run this remailer as a personal activity.  It is in no way
         associated with my place of employment, my employer or the activities
         I engage in on the behalf of my employer.  I run it out of a personal
         account on a commercial system that I pay for with my own money.  If
         you have problems with the remailer, please talk to me first.  If we
         can't resolve it, of course you can always report it to NetCom.
  - 9 -  Finally, be aware that I am not _providing_ privacy.  I am allowing
         it.  That is, _you_ are the caretaker of your rights and must actively
         seek to protect them.  I will help, but that is all I can do.  If
         you wish to protect your privacy, I urge you to learn how and why
         these remailers (and other associated tools) work so that you can use
         them to the best advantage.

What you are describing is the classic 'man-in-the-middle' attack.  It is
not avoidable short of out of band signalling i.e., you know some
fact/secret about the person you really want to talk to (like their public
key) that does not go through the man-in-the-middle (to possibly be
replace), and can't be faked.
Even with such knowledge, you still have to design your protocol with care.
 The essence of one protocol that is proof against this attack is this:
        Diffie-Hellman key exchange, during which the two parties seeking
        privacy also exchange challenge data which is returned after being
        concatenated with the other parties a^x, and signed with their
        private key.
These are only the central parts.  Additionally, certificates might be
exchanged etc.  But even slight changes to this would make it less secure:
e.g. if each party only sent the cryptographically signed a^x, then an
attacker willing to build the log table to (much later) derive x (this
person could even be the intended recipient) could use saved portions of a
real exchange to mount a 'replay' attack.  Also, choosing a system wide 'a'
and 'p' increase the incentive to build the tables, much better to let
people put their personal choice for 'a' and 'p' in their signed & sealed
key certificate.
This protocol is described in detail in a paper (that is not in front of me
right now, so I'm a little fuzzy) that was published in 'Designs, Codes and
Cryptograpy', a periodical originating in the Netherlands.  I believe the
authors were Diffie and van Oorschot(?), but I'm just can't remember off
the top of my head.  If Whit Diffie is reading this message, then surely he
will know, I think, even if he wasn't the author.
Without 'out of band' signalling, the clipper chip would certainly be
subject to this kind of attack.  My understanding is that Skipjack is
symmetric, so that's no help.  We already noted that straight DH key
exchange is vulnerable.  The only remaining hope, then, is that your phone
knows some serial number or such about the phone you _intend_ to be
communicating with, and that this fact is an unavoidable part of the IV
such that once you know who the message is supposed to be coming from, you
couldn't decrypt it unless it really did, and no one else could fake it. This is possible, but obviously teetering on the brink of asymmetry, and
therefore, I think, unlikely.
The man-in-the-middle attack is so well known, however, that clipper must
have _some_ provision for it, and I just haven't read the right paragraph

The 'replay' attack.  Of course you always make the other person say the
hash _and_ some (never reused?) data in a lump (re: my earlier post --
concatenate your challenge data with their a^x before signing) for

  - entropy -
In information theory, a visceral meaning of the term 'entropy' is 'a
measure of surprise', or unpredictability.  Entropy is the amount of
information in some chunk of data, that could not be deduced.  Equating
entropy with randomness is a tautology.  Entropy (like velocity) is
relative, however, to the observer.  If the observer has a good model of
the data, the entropy will be low (not much information present).  If the
observer has a bad model, the entropy will be high.  One example that
demonstrates a difference in relative entropies is a block of ciphertext. The entropy of the block with respect to its intended recipient (who has
the key) is low; with respect to an interloper (no key), it is high.
  - the entropy of english text -
The paper cited by nobody, and alluded to by Bob Baldwin, is a landmark
paper in estimating the entropy of english text.  Note that these estimates
are not lower bounds, but empirical values with respect to the human
'predictors'; and that the (1, 1.5) bits per character are an _average_
across an entire message.  For example, if the message begins "Four score
", then, with respect to a typical American history student, there is very
little entropy in the remainder of the sentence, should it continue " and
seven years ago".
  - turning entropy into random numbers -
From reading Bob Baldwin's post, I am not sure how he intended to extract
this 'one bit per character'.  You would certainly not just pick the n-th
bit from every byte.  A good way to turn entropy into actual bits is to
build a compressor.  A compressor is usually a combination of a predictor
(or model) and an encoder.  The predictor plays the role of the human
'predictors' in Shannon's experiment, and for each new symbol of the
message, generates a probability that represents (inversely) its 'surprise'
at seeing that symbol.  A good encoder uses the probabilities from the
predictor to encode the symbol in the smallest number of bits.  The better
the predictor, the less it is suprised, the larger the probabilities it
returns to the encoder, the fewer number of bits output.  Thus, good
predictors (and competent encoders) lead to efficient compressors.
See Bell, Cleary, & Witten, "Text Compression" Prentice Hall, 1990.  ISBN
0-13-911991-4.  Especially Ch. 5 'From Probabilities to Bits'.
  - entropy and transformations -
Both Bob Baldwin and nobody discuss the use of hash functions on the text
to get random numbers, and wonder if redundancy in the underlying message
will 'show through'.  Cryptographically secure deterministic hash function
are designed with this criteria in mind.  That is, one goal is that the
entropy in the bits of the hash itself, relative to an observer who knows
the input stream, is 0; to an observer who does not know the input stream,
it is maximal (i.e., has a lower bound related to your predictability in
selecting an input).
nobody asks:
  >could someone here describe how this compares to other pseudo-random
  >sources?  how well would this function as a seed to some other
  >pseudo-random number generation process?
Using hashes as random number generators is as secure as the hash which
(for a cyptographically poor hash) may be dependent on the entropy of the
input, and your use of it (e.g., don't always hash the 'Gettysburg Address'
to get your random numbers).  Using compression to convert the entropy in a
message (with respect to the compression model) into a random number is
dependent on the quality of the model.  If you use a poor model, someone
else will be able to find, and perhaps capitalize on, redundancy in your
Related to this, in a conversation on this topic with Ron Rivest he noted
that good enough compression might be secure in itself (with the model and
its initial state as the key), and that he had students who were
researching this.

@_subject: impersonation 
I have recently read many arguments here which can be summarized:
"Cypherpunks technology makes impersonation easy, abuses unpunishable, and
communication untrustable."
This is not true.
There are two major thrusts to the tech discussed on this list.
  a) anonymity, i.e., stripping communication of provable identity;
  b) authentication, i.e., demonstrable proof of identity.
Impersonation based on the technology of the former, can have no more, and
likely much less, credibility than without.  Neither does this technology
afford any additional mechanism by which a user bent on forgery can
illicitly claim another's identity.  The technology of the latter category
(e.g., digital signatures) is, in fact, meant to be a significant obstacle
to this very act.
My identity is my own.  An impersonation of me is an unpermitted use of my
private property: identity and reputation.  It is as reprehensible as any
other theft, and -- at least to me -- is as deep an invasion of my privacy
as rape.  I'm pretty damn pleased that cryptography has provided me a
weapon against it: a weapon advocated by cypherpunks; a weapon wielded
frequently on this list; a weapon we are all armed with, in the bodies of
PGP and PEM.
With the honey, often come the bees, and vice versa.  The same people who
advocate a technology you fear, offer with it a solution far better than
unenforceable prohibition (even if we _had_ been the ones to let the genie
out of the bottle, we couldn't put it back in: dissemination of information
is non-ergodic).  Anonymity software adds no affordances to the already
considerable array of techniques for deceiving people, simply more reliable
'track covering', and conversely, less credibility.  Digital signatures, on
the other hand, provide a simple, tested, workable protection.

Not signatures, certificates.
All key generation takes place locally.  RSA does not generate the keys. These articles are a woeful misrepresentation by over simplification.  I

cypherpunks meeting.

_Not_.  The disk contains a PEM style certificate, authenticating your
public key.  On your local machine, where you generated your private key,
is a file (your private key) called a signer.  This file is your private
key + software to make it sign things, so the whole thing is a self
contained application -- but it refused to function until you bind it to a

Certificate, not signature, just like RSA has been trying to sell them all

Wrong again.  Validation occurs locally because an entire chain of
certificates is provided in the signature

Not signatures, certificates.
All key generation takes place locally.  RSA does not generate the keys. These articles are a woeful misrepresentation by over simplification.  I
will happily provide clarification to the authors if they call me.
If anyone wants, I will demonstrate this software at the next Bay Area
cypherpunks meeting.

I thought this one was gone.
And now a quote from finger remailer
for Issac Norby:
