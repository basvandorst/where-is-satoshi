Using a little dinosaur to write text that hardly anyone else can
read.  (Watch out for little teeth and rabid animal-rights advocates.)
This technique has died out in recent years.
OTOH, steganography is a method of sending messages with improved
security by hiding them in other, innocuous-looking messages.

rcain (Robert Cain) sez:
I think "anathema" may be the wrong word - I would suggest
"incorrect".  As the number of people who habitually use strong crypto
grows, the nefarious conversations will be lost in the noise about
last night's party and recipes for chocolate truffle cake.  The
likelihood that any particular conversation is of interest to LE/NS
types must drop as well.  This will be true unless the number of
strongly-encrypted nefarious conversations grows at least as fast as
the total number of strongly-encrypted conversations.  Somehow I fail
to believe that the supply of crooks is so large.

No.  A char in C is signed or unsigned according to the whim of the
compiler designer, but all bits are significant.  Some UN*X editors
have a nasty habit of nuking the high bit.  Vi frequently does, GNU
emacs doesn't.

Why not use a font that's pleasant to read and include a checksum for
each line?  The reduced character set should make errors reading the
checksums themselves less frequent and easier to detect.  No OCR is
perfect so you may as well be prepared to deal with errors.

Ed Carp  sez:
I suspect significant problems implementing a law that criminalizes
crypto.  The government currently spends $billions per year trying to
eliminate illegal drugs, to very little effect.  Drugs should be
easier to eliminate than crypto since phys-obs can't be copied ad
infinitum as bits can.
There's also the matter of recognizing crypto in use.  A program that
transforms its input so that the output can be converted back to the
input but has maximum entropy is a good compression program and might
also be an encryption program.  If a TLA taps my phone and finds a
mysterious bit sequence, how can they distinguish reliably and cheaply
between an encrypted conversation and a download of
I don't claim *they* can't try to outlaw crypto, and I certainly don't
claim they can't kill millions in the effort, but I *do* claim that
eliminating crypto is a very hard problem.
