As the author of the package in question, I would like to point out:
(1) the email msg Tim refers to (hereafter refered to by me as "query-mail") (2) the query-mail did not refer to any inadequacy in the original
(3) the query-mail was sent to an actual person only after several
(4) checking right now, I find that the finger command does indeed
(5) checking right now, I find that BAL's keyserver does indeed fail
(6) the query-mail is not a purely robotic spam: there is a human in the loop
(7) the keyserver used by query-mail generator defaults, not to some
(8) given that "increasingly sophisticated automatic checking agents"
A question: in a situation like this one, where an individual signed a
message with a key then did not make a key with the return address of
his message available either through his .plan, or a keysever (the two
de facto standards), what next step -if any- do people think is more
appropriate than sending mail to the individual asking them for a copy
of the key ?
This is a fine anarchistic solution to the problem (and that's a
compliment!), from your point of view (although, I hasten to point
out, not quite as good as submitting a key with a valid address on it
to a keyserver).  If anyone else wishes to ignore requests for keys,
the subject string to add to your email kill-file is
Because I do think that automating parts of the the
encryption/signing/verification/decryption/key-retrieval process will
make cryptography more wide-spread (in so far as there is not a
backlash against this automation), I do not want to ignore the
concerns of others.
So...how would people do things differently if they were writing this
sort of software?  One idea proposed by Jiri Baum
 is to find the key ID used to sign the
message, and then query the keyserver with this ID, as opposed to an
email string.  I'm not sure whether or not I like this idea (for
security reasons), but that question is moot, as it seems to be
impossible given the current keyservers.
Any other suggestions or ideas?

OK, then this sidetracks the discussion, as it seems we've got a bug
in either software behavior (despite a fair amount of testing) or user
If it's the former, I apologize for any hassle my software caused.
I'll investigate this and issue a fix if it is a software problem.
However, I remind you that the query-mail said in it

Ack!  ;)  Not my intention at all, but a good observation...
I got this letter in favor of some change in the wording, and a few
letters saying "wording is fine as is".
I assume that those who currently have no beef with the wording will
not be offended by the added words, thus I have happilly integrated
Patrick's suggestion.
I have also added to the code a list of people who don't like
receiving key-queries, added a test that gives an error if the user
attempts to send a key-query to such an address, and made TCM's
address the default value for the list.
I have also added code to maintain a disk-based list of addresses that
have already been mailed for a key, and added code that checks against
this list before sending mail.
I'll put this latest version of mail-secure.el (also upgraded to work
with the latest version of mailcrypt (3.3)) on my web page with in a
day or so.  Until then, anyone who wants a copy can mail me.
To those who sent polite suggestions: thank you.  Your constructive
criticism has helped make mail-secure.el a better tool.  I encourage anyone else who has suggestions or comments to mail me.  I
try to be responsive to constructive input, as doing so helps the
package improve, be accepted and get used.

Well, I still don't understand why you call a message that says a "warning".  I guess we're just using the word "warning" differently...
I never stated or implied that anyone "needed to" respond to
query-mail.  To the contrary, I said in all seriousness that ignoring
query-mail was "a fine anarchistic solution to the problem".
Well, I still don't understand your objection to labor-saving software
any more than I understand the lifestyles of the Amish, but that's my
problem, not anyone else's.
I did not take your comments on mail-secure.el as an attack on myself,
but I did want to defend both the use of labor-saving software and
parts of my particular implementation.  Specifically, I defended the
package against incorrect accusations on your part:
1) the query-mail was not a warning
2) the query-mail was not in response to the content of a post
3) the query-mail was not the first method used, but a last-ditch attempt
4) a human is in the loop
5) the keyserver used is not based on some trivial "preference"
However, I do agree whole-heartedly with your above assertion that
"great care must be taken in running automated mail-response
programs".  For this reason I have responded to your and other posts
by adding features to the package to make it even less likely to
bother people who don't want to be bothered.
To the very best of my knowledge *I* did not send you a piece of mail
requesting your key...I've had your key in my keyring for over a year.
Further, I am not asserting that I saw a signed message from you any
time recently.
Nonsense?  It seems to me that the information is useful, for two
(1) it alerts the recipient to the semi-automated nature of the mail,
(2) it alerts the recipient that incorrect receipt of a key-request
(3) it notes the existance of the package, which the recipient might
Once again you're [ willfully ? ] missing the point: etiquette and
preferences have nothing to do with it, and your repeated assertions
to the contrary trivialize the desire of some people to authenticate
messages they receive (which I and others consider to be a reasonable

To support Tim's thesis, I'll point out that I use the following lisp
configuration directives (among others) along with a news-highlighting
package that I hacked up (gnus-live.el) in order to make reading this
list (bridged to a newsgroup at my site) a much nicer experience.
When I enter the newsgroup, the authors and topics that I like are
highlighted.  I read this 5% of the list in about 15 min, skim another
5%, and then delete the other 90%.

are any subscribers to this list going to be at the RSA conference

I use a lisp package for emacs that I wrote to automatically verify
signatures on incoming mail, so I already see the 10% of messages
which are improperly signed displayed in a red "bad signature" font.
Thus, I'd have no need of this service.
Further, it makes philisophical/political sense to me to have
verification distributed.  Every node should be doing it's own
