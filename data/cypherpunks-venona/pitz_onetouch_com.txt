Would someone be so kind as to describe the Utah initiative?  I wasn't able to find a further description in my percursory search of Mr Froomkin's otherwise very informative home page

@_subject: pgp broken? 
In speaking with an associate, he mentioned in passing that PGP had been broken a few weeks ago in San Diego by the DoD using a Cray.  All questioning about said subject was ended immediately as he felt that he might have said too much how it was.  Was PGP "broken"?
His background:  Prez of a firm with offices in D.C. & Silicon Valley.  He is a former Thunderbird pilot, and so has some connections in the military.  He has designed many hardware encrypting configurations using the VLSI007 chip as well as other chips that I am not familiar with.  One of his present projects is
designing a hardware encryption layout for Apple. Could this be part of the reason the charges were dropped against Phil as well?

I focused my interrogation in this direction, because, as many of you have pointed out, it is VERY doubtful that PGP itself was "broken".
To give further perspective, he kept claiming that a "triple DES with RS4 overlay" was the most secure method of encryption.
