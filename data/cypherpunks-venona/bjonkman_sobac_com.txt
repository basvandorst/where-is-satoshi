Maybe '!number' was making it up, but license plate photography exists today in the Great White North.  A new freeway is being built through Brampton, the 407ETR, for Express Toll Route.  At each on and off ramp there are electronic pickups and video cameras.  You can subscribe to the toll by buying a transducer that sits behind your rear-view mirror, signals from which will be picked up by the the toll gates as you enter and leave the freeway.  If you elect not to subscribe your license plate will be photographed and you'll get a bill in the mail.  If you elect not to pay the bill you'll be nabbed for it the next time you go to get your drivers license or car registration renewed...
Big Brother is not only watching, he's recording your location
and destination, measuring your distance travelled, and charging you for the privilege of driving...
