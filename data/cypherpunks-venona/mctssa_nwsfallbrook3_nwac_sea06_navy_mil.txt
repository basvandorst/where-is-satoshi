of questions:
1)  How is it that I sign a message with PGP and still have the message be in plaintext?  I know this is trivial to most, but new to me.
2)  I know that there were programs out there that would break the protection scheme for ZIP and ARJ files (older versions of both), is there new ones out and what are their keys based on?

I work with a Banyan Vines Network which contains it's own logs.  What type of
logs are you wanting to maintain?  I may be able to help point you in the right direction.

asked for ID to verify the check and when I handed them my military ID, they  asked for my driver's license instead.  I gave them my driver's license and they used it and the magnetic strip on the back of it to verify my check.  I noticed on their computer screen that it had all of my info, as in birthdate, address, driver's license number, the routing number for the bank I am with, and my checking account number.  They also have notices up that say they index everything by your phone number.  I asked them what they were using all of this information for, and they said for their marketing purposes.  I was so ticked off that I took back the check, went to an ATM, pulled out cash, and went back and purchased the item with cash.  I had to buy the item there, because nowhere else in the local area did they have the item.  Just something to keep in mind.

this list to learn about cryptography.  If anything, I would think that you would want to help a new person get up to speed.  If you can't grow up and treat other people like human beings, maybe you ought to take yourself off of the list and go play with your private key by yourself.
help me protect my systems and my messages.  I have no desire to eavesdrop on what you or anyone else is doing on this list.  I merely want to learn, and possibly contribute to the threads on the list.  I have received several responses from people on the list and really appreciate that.  I hope this helps to clarify my position on this list.

   -------------------------- [Original Message] -------------------------      conservative.  I know that this puts off a number of people, but we are each entitled to our own opinion.  I feel that we do need a government in power, but that they have a limited role in our society.  If we didn't have at some ruling power in control, the country would be in total anarchy and we would be taken over by some intolerate country.  The beauty of our system of government protects our rights.  We need a military to protect everyone's ass in this country.  I feel that the government infringes to much on other peoples rights in this country as it is, especially with the current president.  At least with a conservative government in control, they want to keep the money and the power in the hands of the people.
right to privacy.  Personally I feel that the Clipper chip, is a severe infringement upon our rights, and I do NOT support its use.  Notice that I use PGP and not PEM or DES.  If someone is smart enough to use RSA, then they deserve to be able to talk in privacy.  I know that it can be used for alterior motives, but that is the risk with any tool that is available for use.  I hope this helps to explain my opinions a bit better.  I welcome you comments.  BTW, where are those political pieces that people have written.  I would like to look at them, to further educate myself.

Storm/Shield/Sweep.  Before the network was in place, people were using a single channel radio relay box called the Hadron.  It was capable of being used with the KY-57 (crypto) on the PRC-77 (single channel radio), as well as satcom (PSC-3).
coordinated with Quantico, VA, so that the supply cycles, and requests could be sent in real time.  Not every Marine tank was a Banyan server, networks were installed down to the regiment HQ level.  Remote shots were done over MUX lines with KG-84 as the crypto, on a four wire leased circuits.  This allowed for secure communications within the theater of operations, as well as unclassified communications with the rear (stateside).  A number of different ways are available to the Marine Corps to talk to remote spots, and new ways are being found all of the time.  If there is further interest, I would be more than happy to post further to the list.

recently in the Olympic incident of Harding/Kerrigan.  Harding's husband bought one of the cards to make phone calls and they traced the calls back to him via the card, since you have to present valid ID to purchase those.
