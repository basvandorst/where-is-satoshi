Hi Everyone...
Just noticed a little 6 liner on page 10 of the Jan 10 edition of
Information Week Magazine:
Quoted from said magazine...
End of Quoted text - Emphasis on EFF MINE!
I wasn't around in the beginning of January and didn't notice if you
guys had a discussion about this.  If so - sorry, otherwise -
interesting isn't it?
Keep up the great work everyone!
