Here's something funny from an12070 that popped up in comp.org.eff.talk. I won't bother to forward it all, especially in view of all the recent talk of filtering this singular voice.  The rest of it is in the news.

An interesting note buried at the end of a UPI story follows:
[deleted details of bantering between Dole, Mitchell and Biden]
the bill behind him and Dole: The Senate would pass separate legislation
early next year calling for a computerized, instant-background check on
gun buyers within 24 months so it could possibly negate the waiting
or later, Dole said.
What a bunch of cards those boys are.

@_subject: Re: Privacy as a Commodity 
This raises another matter that isn't dealt with here, namely that
historically there has been a grey area between issues of privacy and the
use of shame.  Shame is a powerful societal determinant -- an example of
it is the ostracism faced by any healthy young male who didn't volunteer
during the 'Great' War.  It can raise armies, empower religions, help keep
suddenly noble bloodlines pure and clean.  One-sided use of shame and all
its subtle variants is one of government's most powerful instruments of
opinion control. Getting back to the village example discussed above, the Puritan
settlements of early New England help illustrate both sides of the
question.  There, privacy was superceded by a complex shame-based social
system. And though there were many who were apalled at the way their lives
had been entirely subjugated to a powerfully communicated minority view of
what was shameful, that same shame had, and has today, an insidious way of
keeping people quiet and in their places. This model may be useful to an understanding of privacy.  What is to stop
anyone from asking, and Cypherpunks deal with this issue every day, what
is an appropriate level of privacy?  When that question is formed on the
basis of "What have you got to hide?" it takes on the aspect of
accusation.  And yet, that is precisely the question posed by our
government as it leads the cheers for the good, right-thinking folk who
know that only the guilty, only the criminally insane could ever feel the overwhelming need for absolute privacy. There's a parallel between those Puritan villages that figure so
prominently in America's early colonial history and what is happening now
as cyberspace is settled.  Moderns look back at those times and remark on
the amazing ignorance that drove many of the most terrible features of
those societies. That ignorance hasn't gone anywhere; it is still with us.  They might be
hard to spot with the buckles off their hats, but the same people who
today want escrowed keys and backdoors into all our lives are the
ideological descendents of the Puritan finger-sharpeners.  If that's true,
then this is a damn good fight. And we can be sure of it whenever we hear: Cypherpunks, shame on you!

The last two messages I've sent through remailers have taken upwards of two days to arrive at their destinations.  Parallel messages sent directly arrived immediately.
The two remailers are Hal's and rebma.
What is making this happen?  Is it related to all the recent PGP FAQ traffic?  Which remailers if any are not suffering from these lags?

Greetings C'punks:
Normally I'm just a lurker here on cypherpunks, but I thought that the new net.cop mode might be of interest to us all.
Here are the results of Mr. Sternlight's assiduous policing:
---------- Forwarded message ----------
In tracking down slow response on netcom8, I discovered that user beker was
idle for over 16 minutes, and since the timeout was supposed to be 12, I
fingered him to see if he was a netcom staffer.
I found his .plan file contained a PGP 2.3a key. That infringes RSADSI's
patents. That this is so has recently been confirmed by an independent
inquiry by lawyers retained by MIT.
The patent holder, RSADSI, has said that no only do versions of PGP except the
soon-to-be-released 2.6 and the commercially sold Viacrypt version 2.4
infringe in the U.S., but posted keys and key servers constitute inducement
to infringe and/or conspiracy to infringe.
Given netcom's new user agreement, I'm user user beker will want to correct

@_subject: My 2.3a Key is listed as a 2.6 on MIT 
On the WWW I went over to Brian LaMacchia's announced new keyserver and looked myself up.
I was amazed to see that my 2.3a key now carries a 2.6 version number and lists an 8-bit key ID.  The key ID is identical to the old one with two new characters up front.
I have never ordered 2.6 because I'm satisfied with 2.3a and rely on it for communications with people outside the US.  Does this bizarre "upgrading" mean that my key, as downloaded from that server, will function as a 2.6 key and become incompatible with 2.3n versions after the September 1st deadline?
And what are the other implications of the keyserver evidently automatically changing version numbers and ID's on public keys previously resident on the list?  I am bothered by seeing my key differ in any way from the way I originally generated it.

Who cares.  A mention of WIRED in cypherpunks is far more noteworthy.  The lag time inherent in magazine production, particularly a magazine dealing with the expansion of cyberspace, is oxymoronic.  Here, at least there is immediacy combined with no whit of concern for the expectations of readership. Wired isn't even worth reading any more.
