Actually we are getting strong interest from almost everybody but RSA.
I imagine that RSA may have some plans in this area, but what they are
is unknown to me.
Har! Besides the certificate problems, are there other problems with
PEM that have prevented its adoption?
Our implementation supports this X.509 stuff as well. We don't have a
DUA yet though...
