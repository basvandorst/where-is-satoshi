@_subject: Wanted: NNTP posting access for remailers 
Would anyone out there be willing to give NNTP posting or transfer
privileges to anon.lcs.mit.edu?
Because of recent spams through mail2news I may
loose my news posting privileges to the news server I have been using.
Though I try to resolve all complaints I receive, other complaints
have been sent to other postmasters in the domain, who don't seem to
want to hear about these problems.
If you run a news server and would like to help people posting
anonymous messages, please consider allowing posts from
mail2news  Ideally you would also be in a position
to receive mail at some of the relevant postmaster aliases in your
domain, and would not mind forwarding misdirected complaints to me so
that I can deal with them.  Alternatively, if you are willing to give
me "IHAVE" priviliges, I can possibly set things up with an initial
"Path:" header that guarantees most complaints will go directly to me.

@_subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: nym.alias.net enters beta testing 
I'm pleased to announce that the nym.alias.net pseudonym server has
now entered the beta-testing phase, and seems quite stable.
Nym.alias.net offers several interesting features:
  * Public-Key encryption of all received mail.  Once mail has gone
    through nym.alias.net, no one can read it except you--even if you
    have been sending your mail to a newsgroup and your reply-block
    and remailers become compromised.
  * Support for multiple, probabilistically-weighted, reply blocks.
    These can be used for redundancy or to foil traffic analysis with
    decoys.
  * Replay detection.  This foils replay attacks, but can also be used
    for higher reliability if you send redundant copies of a message
    through different remailer chains.
  * An option to receive only fixed-length messages (by splitting up
    large messages and padding small ones with garbage).
  * An option to sign mail you send with the remailer's public key, so
    as to give some assurance of authenticity without having to
    publish your own PGP public key.
  * Support for finger [pending DNS approval].  You can choose to make
    your nym's PGP public key available to all who finger its E-mail
    address.  Right now you can test this by fingering at 18.26.0.252.
In addition, experimental nym.alias.net support for Premail is now
available (in the form of a patch to premail 0.44).  With this patch,
premail will store your nym's PGP key on encrypted keyrings.  This
allows you to publish a PGP key for your pseudonym without the danger
of your identity being revealed to someone with access to your main
PGP keyrings (or a backup copy of them).
To obtain more information about nym.alias.net, finger
 or send mail to .  To
get information about using premail with nym.alias.net, finger
 or send mail to
These documents are also available on the new nym.alias.net web page:
    Please report all bugs to .  I'll also be glad to
consider feature requests, particularly from anyone interested in
developing any more client software.

@_subject: Re: Too few nymservers 
Well, I just designed a nymserver that's probably more complicated and
difficult to use than any previous one.  From this experience, I have
concluded that if you want to design a remailer with real security (as
opposed to a penet-style server), it just won't be easy to use that
remailer manually.  Even alpha.c2.org was kind of a pain to use
manually.  I therefore think in the long run it's better to bite the
bullet, write as secure a nym server as possible, and expect that
people will use special client software to use the remailer.
Incidentally, if anyone else wants to run another nym.alias.net-style
remailer, the code is available and I'd be glad to help anyone set
things up if that person is serious about running a nymserver.

@_subject: Re: MD5? 
Is there any way to I could possibly get a snapshot of the source code
if I agree not to bug you about it?  I have some servers that use PGP
pretty heavily, and will come under immediate preassure to upgrade to
3.0 as soon as it is released.  Any head start I can get would be
really really helpful.
While you may be offering a similar command line interface, I have
been forced to make heavy-duty use of what might turn out to be just
quirks in the 2.6.2 implementation.  For example, to encrypt with the
first key on a keyring, when I don't know the ID of that key, I use
the ID "0x" which just happens to work in 2.6.2 but has no reason to
work in 3.0.  In many places I also just rely on text processing
the standard output and error of PGP to look for particular strings.
Clearly this kind of thing is not going to be robust against against a
complete rewrite of the source code.
I understand that at this point the last thing you want is a whole
bunch of questions from beta testers to slow you down.  However, for
some people a look at the source code would be incredibly useful, even
if they can't ask you for any help with it.
Is there any way to work something like this out?

@_subject: IMPORTANT: Changes affecting anon.lcs.mit.edu privacy 
I'm looking into reconfiguring anon.lcs.mit.edu (a.k.a. nym.alias.net)
in ways that will improve performance and reliability.  This could
involve several changes (either temporary during testing, or even
permanent) that might affect the privacy of users.  I hope these
changes won't affect people who use anon.lcs.mit.edu and nym.alias.net
according to the instructions, but given the sensitive nature of
anonymous services, I want to alert people of these changes to avoid
any surprises.
 * 'Received:' headers may suddenly appear.  Currently,
   anon.lcs.mit.edu does not add 'Received:' headers to any mail it
   relays or delivers to nym.alias.net aliases.  Since the anonymous
   remailers mix and config/send
   already strip header information upon receiving messages, this
   shouldn't really affect people unless they are telnetting to the
   SMPT port and forging E-mail.  Such forgeries are not condoned by
   the administrators, anyway, and have actually not been much of a
   problem.
   If, however, you were somehow relying on anon.lcs.mit.edu's
   sendmail for "light" anonymity, you should start using real
   remailers before it's too late.  Though I don't really mind
   suppressing Received: headers, this looks somewhat difficult to do
   with MTA's other than sendmail, so if sendmail gets junked, we may
   end up with something that adds Received headers.
 * SMTP destination statistics may be kept.  Recent versions of
   sendmail (and other MTA's) can keep statistics on delivery to
   remote machines, to prevent blocking multiple times when sending
   mail to unavailable remote hosts.  The information kept appears to
   be the name of each remote machine to which mail has been sent, and
   the last time at which an attempt to send mail to that host was
   made.  Such information would not be backed up, and could
   potentially be purged daily.
   I understand this may cause concern.  I welcome any feedback or
   suggestions on how to deal with this, either in sendmail or also
   qmail (which I'm thinking of switching to).  The worst case
   scenario seems to be the case where anon is seized or stolen and
   someone discovers that your machine received a piece of mail from
   it.  No information will be available about whether or not you ever
   sent mail to anon.lcs.mit.edu.  This seems acceptable because if
   someone really needed to prove you had received a piece of mail
   from nym.alias.net, that person could already do so by tapping your
   network and sending you a message through nym.alias.net.
Despite these changes, anon.lcs.mit.edu does not currently and will
never keep any message-by-message mail logs.  Sendmail currently runs
at log level 1, which the documentation describes as logging only
"Serious system failures and potential security problems."

Because of recent attacks on the remailer network and mail2news
gateways, I may loose access to at least one of the news servers I
currently feed news to from my mail2news gateway.
If you are a news administrator, believe in free speech and anonymity,
and you would like to help the cause, please consider giving transfer
(aka "IHAVE" or "hosts.nntp") privileges to this machine.  You will
not be the only server, and so do not need to worry about being the
point of entrance of mail2news articles to Usenet.
Please contact me if you can help.  Thank you.
For those who oppose the existence of mail2news gateways, you should
know that we are taking steps to limit the abuse.  However, doing so
without in any way limiting articles that abide by the usage policy is
tricky, and must be done carefully.  Please be patient.

@_subject: Re: WANTED: Tolerant, anonymity-friendly news admins 
Well, as best I can tell I've gotten caught in the crossfire of a
spam/"anti-spam" spam war.  People are forging articles through
anonymous remailers to solicit spam to non-spamming customers of
"spam-friendly" ISPs, in the hopes of driving those customers away.
In other words, a lot of articles are being posted to groups like
alt.make.money.fast with headers like:
 From: customer (My^ISP^spams^I^should^switch)
Then the spam bots collect the addresses, and send lots of mail like
 To: customer (My^ISP^spams^I^should^switch)
 Subject: Great opportunity!!!
 My^ISP^spams^I^should^switch,
 I saw your post the other day, and have an oportunity for you that's
 so good you can't miss it...
It would be amusing if it weren't causing me hassles.  Ultimately,
however, the person doing this is clearly trying to get ISPs to set
more restrictive policies about what mail/news customers can send,
while knocking off a few anonymous remailers and mail2news gateways in
the process.
At issue here are a number of complicated high-level administrative
issues.  It's not just that someone is trying to pull the plug on me.
I've been asked by someone who is not the one getting the phone calls
or exerting anti-mail2news pressure if I would stop using MIT news
servers.  The reason is that that person needs to maintain good
relations with the people who are being harassed over the fogery.
I don't really want to go into details.  The point is that this
situation is a lot more subtle than whether the pro-mail2news people
can "out-harrass" the people complaining about forgeries.  Therefore,
I would sincerely appreciate it if you did not try to make any phone
calls or do anything to use up any more of these people's time.  I
fully intend to keep mail2news running, and am just trying to get more
news servers (after having lost one) to maintain reliability and
strengthen my position.
