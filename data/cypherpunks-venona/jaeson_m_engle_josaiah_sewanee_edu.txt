@_subject: Longer than 1048 bit keys 
I'm using MacPGP 2.6(ui) and noticed that the limit for a key size is the
1048 bit ("military grade" (right)). Is there anyway to circumvent this to
make larger, harder-to-break-type keys?

@_subject: Re: The Remailer Crisis 
Just out of curiousity on this subject, is there any remailer software for
Macs? I think I have enough leverage and power on my campus to be able to
run a remailer here during the school months *which is when I have net
access*.  If there isn't, how hard would it be to do? Could it be done with
something like MailShare indirectly?

@_subject: Place for WWW info/ stuff 
I have a server (WWW and ftp) that I would like to use for anything anyone
needs a place for. Drop me a line, or visit what's on my server (see
below). The part of the server that I will be putting cypherpunk related
material is password controled, and cannot be accessed unless you have am
account and password (assuming of course someone else doesn't break in and
figure someone's out that is... but I don't see how they could.)
This is just FYI for all and anyone!

Okay. Here's my 2-bits.
I run on the MacOS, but how hard could it be to port this code? If anyone
is willing to do this (I assume it's not written in Pascal, which is my
only language of any consequence), I will run it. It will be available from
now until I graduate in '98 during the school months. If anyone wants to
try this from scratch, we could try it in Pascal. I would be very willing
to do the developing as well as host a discussion list for anyone who jumps
I will take no responce to mean that all options are not going to be
pursued, and that this discussion is just that, a discussion.

Yes, my machine has a 56k direct line in, 24 hrs. a day, 7 days a week
(during school months!;-)) The server you just mailed to is on this
I understand this, and am trying my best to cope. I am currently in the
process of developing a name server for the Mac, because the Mac has alot
against it when it comes to being a real eintity on the 'Net.
I agree that the Mac lacks some of the more powerful Unix features, namely
preemtive multitasking, but I also believe that, at least with the newer
Macs, CPU time-sharing is more efficient than it used to be. Know of Chuck
Shotton's MacHTTP WWW server for the Mac? An excelent piece of software
that gives literally on demand, and at least with my copy, it is always in
the background. Really about the only thing that cuts out CPU timesharing
is multimedia, mostly 3D grahpis games and highly intense graphics
software, neither of which I use (much!;-))
I thought that it was in Perl. I have tried pulling Unix Perl scripts and
running them under MacPerl, but it doesn't quite do it. In fact, it usually
doesn't do anything but spew errors back at you.
As I noted, I have a constant 56k line in/ out. And mine never moves...
it's a bit large... mine is a Quadra 660av (ugh).
As far as I can tell, and maybe you have other knowedge on this, my
situation should work, assuming I can run the software. What do you think?
Should the remailer Perl script run under MacPerl?

This is an interesting approach. It could even contain a small set of PGP'd

Since I have begun the project of writing the Remailer for the Mac,
I suddenly realized that I do not know exactly what is expected of it, and
therefore would like some pointers to the specs of a remailer (I have seen
references to padding and splitting but do not know what this is nor how to
implement it.)

Thanks for the sites, but after looking at them, I can say they will NOT
build in THINK C. But, They might help me figure out what to do with
Remailer (the Mac version I'm building).  Also, I'm not writing mine
in C, I'm doing it in Pascal, because 1) I have the TCP libraries for it and
2) I don't now C very well at all.

Very much agreed. In this type of situation there is no room for compromise.
If we compromise, we lose, thus my earlier snipy comment about EFF. They compromised and lost. We cannot do this now, we must win this or it starts going downhill from here.
