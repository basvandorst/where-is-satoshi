@_subject: java crypto packages 
The last time I looked, the coderpunks were talking about java crypto
packages.  Can anyone on that list tell me if any code has been made available?  Unfortunately the archive is dead...

@_subject: plaugue of unsubscribes 
I've started sending mail to postmasters when I get one of those "take me off your list!" messages.  I explain that the user is on a high volume list, that he wants off, but
that he seems unwilling or unable to do it himself.  He's harassing the
members of the list, who don't have the ability to remove him, and he doesn't seem to be reading our replies to his "take me off!" messages, which tell him how to solve his problem.
Then I ask the postmaster to explain how to get off the list to the user.
These guys are abusing email, and since they don't read our mail, the postmaster is the only solution.  Perhaps if a few of us start writing to the postmasters, they'll help the user figure out how to get off.

This is a reasonable approach if you're just going to send information from the applet to the server, which is what we were talking about.  But if we want to use java applets for secure two way communications, aren't we going to need to find some entropy somewhere?
Is it feasible to make an input package that stores up entropy from
keyboard and mouse events as an applet is used?  Then when entropy is
needed, whatever's available is used.  If there's not enough a scribble
window or text field could pop up and the user could generate the rest. (This isn't my idea, I'm inferring it from something Hal wrote.)
And over the long run, what, if anything, could Sun do to let applets have
access to more entropy in Java?  Would it be practical to have an entropy
source in the api, that could be combined with other sources in the

@_subject: Sameer got plugged on C-SPAN 
Janlori Goldman, at the Center for Democracy & Technology, just mentioned
Sameer's anonymizer on C-SPAN during a segment of Internet privacy.
They showed a shot of the screen and everything.
