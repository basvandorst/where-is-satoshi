Name: monkeyboy cypher-prik
sixdegrees Password: leapsink
In response to your request for a new sixdegrees(tm) password, we have sent you the following temporary password: leapsink. As soon as you come to the site,  , and use it to log-in on the home page, it will become your official password, and your old password will be deactivated. (If you end up remembering your old password and use that to log-in at the site before using this new temporary password, the temporary password will be deactivated.)
This may seem wacky, but it's for your security. And, either way, once you successfully log-in at the site, you can go to your personal profile and choose whatever password you like - in fact, we encourage you to do so.
If you never requested a new password and got this message in error, just continue using your old password and e-mail us at issues PLEASE NOTE: All replies to this address are processed by a computer.
If you have any problems, questions or requests send an e-mail to issues and someone will get back to you as soon as
