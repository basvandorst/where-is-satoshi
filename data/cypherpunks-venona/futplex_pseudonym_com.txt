No crypto/privacy relevance, delete or flame now....
I think this is a bit misguided. The Turing machine (TM) is an extremely general
abstract model of computation. The gargantuan hunk of code that runs the Space Shuttle can be viewed as a Turing machine, as can a "Hello world" program
written in Visual BASIC. So, there's not really a question about whether or
not we're talking about Turing machines (unless perhaps you want to discuss
quantum theorem provers and QTMs :) Now, Rice's Theorem says that all non-trivial properties of TMs are undecidable.
If I pick a "non-trivial" property, I can't conceivably build a TM ("write a
program", if you like) that, upon input of the specification of an arbitrary TM,
can tell whether or not that TM exhibits the property I picked. This does not
mean that I can't decide whether some particular TMs have that property or not --
I can. I just can't write down a procedure that handles the general case.
Also, this theorem clearly hinges on the meaning of "trivial". From what I've
seen, a very strict interpretation is largely appropriate; nearly everything
except the least exciting of trivial low-level properties of TMs seems to come
out to be "non-trivial" in this regard. The proof of the theorem is more
precise about this, naturally, but I've found this useful as a working
colloquial definition.

Some CoS news:
This past Saturday (95/08/12) a prominent Church of Scientology litigator,
Helena Kobrin, and some U.S. federal marshals raided the home of Arnaldo
Lerma, seizing pretty much all his computer hardware, disks, etc. It seems
that back in 1993, CoS was suing someone named Steven Fishman. As part of the
legal proceedings he filed a "declaration", which routinely became part of the public record of the business of the court. This happens to have included
some of the OT documents which the CoS claims as both copyrighted trade secrets and sacred texts.
As with other unsealed court documents, copies of the Fishman declaration are
available by snail mail from the court for 50 cents/page. Lerma ordered a
copy from the court, then posted it to alt.religion.scientology. Now CoS is
claiming copyright infringement. Helena Kobrin apparently wants to advance the
state of the art in Infocalypse hyperbole; she is quoted in a wire service
story as saying, in reference to Lerma's posting,
Meanwhile, various sites have started carrying copies of the Fishman declaration, made available by http, ftp, gopher, finger, etc. A site in
China was one of these data havens, until the resultant traffic load forced it
to shut down. David Touretzky, a member of the CS faculty at Carnegie-Mellon, had a complete copy on his Web pages at  until CMU's legal counsel received a fax from Helena Kobrin, demanding their
Pending review by the CMU legal staff, he has taken them off. However,
he is maintaining a list of links to sites that still carry copies of
the declaration, along with pointers to some other relevant sites, and his
own comments on the situation.  Apparently quite a few other a.r.s folks
and their ISPs have received similar warning letters from HKK. Someone did
a fairly competent forgery on a.r.s of a version of the warning letter,
purportedly from Helena Kobrin to the entire net. I found it disturbingly
plausible. Also, someone forged cancels of various articles including parts of
the Fishman declaration, and of at least one which quoted no more than Touretzky's URL. A couple of other interesting sources for information on the Scientology/Net situation I've found recently are:                                and Freedom Magazine Vol 27, Issue 4, published by the CoS RTC, has some articles
online dealing with copyright, anonymity, privacy, and cryptography. As I've said before, I'm scared of getting slapped with a frivolous lawsuit by some arm of the CoS, so I won't quote anything from the articles. Perhaps some of
the other vocal people on the list who think CoS wouldn't hurt a fly will
distribute some choice Fair Use quotes.

Most of this reminds me of observations others have made (maybe here) about
LEAs' typical use of wiretapping, commercial records, etc. in gathering
evidence. It was said that criminals are often tracked/caught because of
communications with friends/relatives, and transactions with above-board
businesses to rent cars, buy plane tickets, etc. An argument against
allegations that free crypto is hazardous proceeds, then, by pointing out
that such contacts with *ahem* "regular folks" will be conducted in the
clear, or at least that one party will be cooperative with investigators.
Whether or not I encrypt my conversation with the Phil Zimmermann Travel
Agency, however, doesn't affect the ability or inclination of the PZTA to divulge its records to the TLAs. They would no longer beable (old a.r.k. joke)
to learn the contents of the communication directly from a wiretap. But if I
understand the technology correctly, they could certainly trace an encrypted
call to determine the identity of the other party. After that it's a trivial
matter to ask the other party to reveal transaction records. So I don't see
how the strong encryption of the "good" significantly interferes with The
Legitimate Needs of Law Enforcement in and of itself.   (As an aside, the situation may get murky when the Phil Zimmermann Travel
 Agency carries out transactions over the net with cryptographically sound
 digital pseudonyms. Depending on the circumstances, true ecash with
 reasonable payor anonymity may also need to be involved. This is where I
 suspect untraceable transactions make the LEAs uncomfortable: untraceable
 garden variety transactions)
Hmmm. The bit about "the intermixing of bad and good" is puzzling. "Bad"
and "good" seem to be defined in terms of the identities of the parties to
a communication. Figuring those out isn't hindered by strong crypto per se.
I remain unclear as to the source of their expressed concern.
Your paraphrase of Nelson's statement strikes me as remarkable. Doesn't "we
are not concerned with bad people using crypto among themselves" run
completely counter to all the hyperbole about terrorists planning OKC II

I think I have figured out now what Clavadetscher meant. According to the
PrivaSoft home page, the product uses "bitmap encryption". Inspired by your
mention of patents being published, I sought a relevant patent, and I believe
I've found it. U.S. Patent 5,321,749 was issued to a Richard Virga of Danbury,
CT in 1994. It describes a protocol for representing an arbitrary fax
document as a bitmap, encrypting it, and encoding it for transmission. The user inputs a password (4-20 characters) to be used as a session key. However, no encryption algorithm is specified. (The patent suggests the familiar method of seeding a PRNG with the session key, and XORing the resulting stream with the plaintext bitmap.)
Assuming this is in fact the scheme PrivaSoft uses, I posit that their
"crypto engine" consists of a patented (by someone who now works for them ?)
protocol wrapped around a proprietary encryption algorithm.
20 characters (the patent doesn't discuss constraints on the character set,
AFAIK) looks rather short. This is one possible reason for the Commerce Dept.'s export approval.
 discusses PrivaSoft.

---- begin included message ----
I've spent some time reading these proposed standards, along with parts of
RFCs 1423 and 1590, with an eye to applying them to remailers. I'd like to
get a sanity check and comments before I consider proceeding with submission
to the IETF Media Types review list, etc.
I propose a new Media Type subtype for Mixmaster remailer packets,
"application/mixmaster". (For the purposes of this message, "Mixmaster
remailer packet" refers to a packet generated by a Mixmaster server or client,
and intended for transmission to a Mixmaster server. It does *not* cover
messages generated by a Mixmaster server that are intended for an ultimate
message recipient.) This is intended to be an experimental protocol
for use in the control part of a multipart/encrypted message. There is one required parameter, "version", meant to indicate the version
number of the originating Mixmaster software. In addition, one optional
parameter, "key-id", may be included. If present, this parameter would
indicate the single line key prefix/ID of the public Mix key used to
encrypt (at the outermost layer) the contents of the application/mixmaster
part. This might be used to thoroughly disambiguate decryption options in
the event that the recipient server has more than one currently active
public Mix keys.
The application/mixmaster (control) part of the multipart/encrypted message would contain the padded list of Mixmaster server hop headers, superencrypted at the outermost layer with a public Mix key (presumably, one belonging to the
recipient server). A single decryption of these headers should reveal the
IDEA key used to superencrypt, at the outermost layer, the body part of the
multipart/encrypted message. The application/octet-stream (body) part of the
multipart/encrypted message would contain the list of ultimate recipients of
the remailed message, the text of the message itself, and any additional processing instructions to the final Mix server. The latter, body part of
the multipart/encrypted message shall have been encrypted by the originator
using the IDEA key specified in the former, control part.
The contents of the application/mixmaster part should be encoded in
accordance with the standards for application/octet-stream.
(NB: this amounts to a division of the extant Mixmaster packet format roughly into a control section and a body ("payload") section.)

# What occurs to me is that PGP could be considered a "device" to obscure # contents of data therby preventing the determination of a copyright # violation.
Encryption (as opposed to decryption) doesn't defeat any mechanisms that stop someone from violating a copyright. It can make the _detection_ harder, but not the _commission_. So I don't think that should be a concern.
(As usual, IANAL.)
Building upon Tom Bell's and cjs' observations, I suppose it could be argued
that encryption can be employed as a means of copyright protection. Hence
some decryption programs might be outlawed as devices intended to
"deactivate" copyright-protecting technology. I can't think of any c'punks projects so far that try to pierce security schemes meant to shield materials from copyright violations. Since many cypherpunks aren't inclined to preserve copyrights, they lack a motive for
ensuring the integrity of copyright protection methods. Cypherpunks launch
attempts to crack security systems in order ultimately to improve them, not for the sake of breaking them. I expect the alt.2600 crowd would be more
directly affected by S. 1284.
As a matter of principle, though, I don't think we should be amicable to a
bill like S. 1284. It's a bit disturbing to see that it's cosponsored by
Sens. Patrick Leahy & Russ Feingold, who led the Senate opposition to the

Funny you should ask. A week or so ago someone mentioned PrivaSoft's fax
encryption software here. The promotional material we saw mentions two points
about the product which I believe were seen as bad omens by many of us on the cypherpunks list. To wit:
(1) PrivaSoft uses a proprietary encryption algorithm
Cryptanalysis is a challenging task. Comparatively little is known about how
to prove, in some formal sense, that any given cryptographic algorithm is
strong. Most people in the field have reached the conclusion that the test of
time is the best true measure of the cryptographic strength of an algorithm.
Until plenty of people have pounded on the algorithm, you can't really have
much confidence about it.
Moe concretely: If you believe your algorithm is strong, then you have no
reason to fear an expert review, and should in fact welcome it. On the other
hand, if you won't reveal your algorithm, we have little basis for trusting
our confidential data to it. (2) PrivaSoft has been approved for export by the U.S. Govt.
As you probably know, the U.S. Government restricts the export of strong
cryptography (using the ITARs), with some notable exceptions for bankers
and authentication-only deployments. PrivaSoft isn't selling strictly to
banks, and attempts to protect confidentiality. Ergo, the government doesn't
think you're using strong cryptography. Case in point: the separate U.S. and international versions of Netscape Navigator. The exportable version uses the RC4 algorithm (as part of the SSL
protocol) with an effective key length of 40 bits, while the domestic version
uses 128 bits. Some people here made the news a short while ago with a concrete demonstration of the inadequacy of the shorter key length. That was
proof-of-concept for an idea already fairly well-accepted in cryptographic
PrivaSoft looks worse than the int'l. version of Navigator. At
least with the browser, Netscape had levelled with everyone up front and
used a reasonably well-known published algorithm. Thus we had good reason to
believe it provides a non-trivial level of security. The C'punks Key
Cracking Ring showed just what it takes to cross that line. But we have
absolutely _no_ evidence that PrivaSoft does anything hard to break at all.
Bottom line: you have to release the specs. of your algorithm, to a panel
of experts under NDAs or (preferably) to the public, to convince us that PrivaSoft offers us real security.

source code to the pile:
The graphic encryption patents I found a couple of weeks ago (cited here then) describe a method that I don't believe would be susceptible to a "jigsaw"
attack like this. The patented method specifies encrypting the image bitmap
bit-by-bit (it suggests XORing with a (P)RNG stream). So the square
granularity would fail your second criterion for the applicability of a jigsaw
attack. However, I only have circumstantial evidence to suggest that the PrivaSoft software actually uses the patents I've seen.
Perhaps PrivaSoft Inc. could comment on which patent(s) (if they have already issued) form the basis for the use of encryption in their product ?

    That remailer is subject to various sorts of pressure if the remailed-

Either way, at least one remailer is subject to pressure for sending a specific piece of email.
(If the token is passed around randomly, then it might be more difficult for an adversary to predict which remailer will send the _next_ message. However,

Gluing Agents on their accounts. I posit that such people are likely to be anonymity-friendly, and thus unlikely to complain vociferously about any anonymous mail they receive.
This protocol generally could not be used to send anonymous mail to public fora -- mailing lists, newsgroups, etc. -- except some freewheeling places
like cypherpunks which don't object to conventional anonymized mail anyway.

I get the feeling you are confusing two separate issues here. Users do tend to use easily memorized passphrases, which is indeed a problem, because such

I'm curious about the potential sociological effects of such a move. I
imagine that pseudonyms would be attracted to "permanent" remailers for
use in their reply chains. But this phenomenon could/should be mitigated by
the possibility that sting remailers would tend to advertise themselves as
"permanent" (truthfully, even !), in anticipation of the bias in pseudonym
remailer chain inclusion.
Enemies of anonymity might specially target remailers claiming to be "permanent" for antisocial uses.
This is all similar to the effects (observed and supposed) of the existing
reliability ratings for remailers. But the sharp contrast of a binary property might make the effects more pronounced.
Perhaps it would be useful/meaningful to note the duration (or

Er, thanks for the clarification....
All right, what makes you think that ?  Lest we wave our hands too much and

If you have a substantially different scenario in mind, let me know.
Suppose that I send an anonymous message to a public forum such as this. I
and the message seem to "have anonymity" by any standard I can presently
imagine. Now, in what ways might I or the message lack integrity in this
situation ?  I haven't broken my personal ethical codes, although perhaps
I've violated someone else's. I have been honest, at least as much as I am
generally honest in anything I write. I am not lying by donning the cloak of
anonymity; I have not misrepresented my identity, merely refused to reveal
it. The content of the message can be considered sound as much as anything
else can. The message is incomplete in the sense that it does not include
the true identity of the author -- is this what you would claim as a
failure of integrity ?  All messages are incomplete in the sense that
various important facts are absent from them.
I understand the nature of the information flow argument, but I don't see
that it's applicable. You appear to contend that the assurance of the
integrity of an anonymous message depends upon the examination of
information that is "secret", that is, _not part of the message_. But no
message is complete -- all messages have many such associated "secrets" not
available as part of the messages. So the claim seems to be vacuous: we
can assure the integrity of neither anonymous nor verinymous messages.
Perhaps the rejoinder will be that anonymous messages have a _characteristic_ piece of missing "secret" information, namely the senders'
True Names. But you have yet to offer any argument that only certain special
"secrets" must be examined in order to verify integrity.

Granted, some people would have been more inclined to look askance at the
messages if they had known the author's True Name. But as the saying goes,
"past performance is not a guarantee of future results". You can choose to
doubt or believe a message because of the author's past reputation. But
reputation is not a reliable predictor of the integrity of future assertions.
It's a nice psychological crutch, but reliance on a "rational expectation" is
a long way from anything I would call "assurance" or "verification". It
doesn't prove anything. The only acceptable method of assurance I can see is
careful analysis of the propositions posited, and empirical verification of
the facts presented. Leaning on past reputation is accepting an odd form of
Proof by Authority.
As it happened I had never heard of the True Name of the sender, so the
knowledge wasn't useful to me.

By asking yourself if they seem to make sense, checking them against known
facts and beliefs, etc. The same methods, IMHO, that are mainly appropriate
to assess anyone's statements.
Of course, the is-a-person problem has been discussed at great length. Digital signatures are as effective for pseudonyms as for anyone else.
The messages we've seen "from Alice de `nonymous" might all have come from
different senders. They exhibit a common tone and style, but that doesn't
assure us of anything. In a sense that makes them more inviting,
since there's always the chance that a third party is attempting a clever
parody or a sly bit of character assassination.
In my experience, that's about all I can usually do in network communication.

that charges for advertising based upon the measured number of accesses to
the advertising has the kind of authentication problem mentioned above. The
party paying for the advertising only wants to pay to reach "legitimate" customers. A dishonest publisher (selling ad space) could access the
advertising many times herself to artificially inflate the access figures,
justifying higher advertising charges. To avoid paying for this "illegitimate" traffic, the advertiser would like to
authenticate the accesses as *not* coming from the untrusted publisher. This
is a hard problem in general, because the advertiser really wants to discount accesses by the publisher, her agents, her family, her friends, etc. It's

4.2 Internet Security Technology Development

     more, interest in increasing the level of security capability in the      Internet as does any other segment of society.
Enhance Internet Application Security
     A number of key Internet applications have become central to agencies'      increasing Internet activities. Such key applications should be examined
     and, where appropriate, strengthened to the extent possible. Among the      applications that require high-priority attention are the following:
     Public Information Servers - Second only to email is the expanding use of
     Internet-based public information server methods, most visibly the World      Wide Web and the associated Mosaic/Linx client applications.      Unfortunately, there are a number of known security vulnerabilities      associated with the use of these applications.

Generally it's advisable to use a different IV for each encryption to avoid correlations between the ciphertexts for plaintexts that have the same prefix. If you always used the same IV, then two messages that start with the

[...example with a set of 2 * 10^6 primes...elided]
I think there are two main (related) problems with this protocol:
(1) It does not offer great security. The time required for a brute force attack is only linear in the time required to execute the protocol. So Alice will want to start out with an enormous number of primes (the linear factor). Even so, the attacker's job is relatively easy.
(2) It is rather impractical. The time required to execute the protocol is
prohibitive (assuming Alice uses a huge number of primes). Consider the numbers in your example. Alice generates N = 2*10^6 large primes and transmits the 10^6 pair products -- that's on the order of .1 gigabits, or
about 12 megabytes, to transmit (assuming products around 100 bits long, so
Bob can factor one before the heat death of the universe). Bob factors one of the products, which should take a while for all this to be at all worthwhile.
Let's say it takes Bob approximately an hour to factor.
This will take too long to do online. Alice and Bob won't generate new keys for each session this way. But to limit the chance that Eve can start to decrypt their communications in real time to 10%, if Eve has 100
times the computing power of Bob, they'll need to negotiate a new key every
6 weeks or so. This is not so hot.

doesn't prevent the final remailer (or anyone between the last remailer and the recipient) from altering the plaintext payor_id.
It seems to me that end-to-end encryption is not significantly more important
for remailed messages. Really, there's less information in the message when
it emerges from the last remailer, so there's less to protect than in the

Hmmm. I can't see anything wrong with your reasoning, and I too am puzzled by
Schneier's comment about Alice needing to send R_1 to Bob initially. I hope
someone else will give a more authoritative answer.
Your question prompted me to study the other bit commitment protocols in
_AC_ a bit more closely (pun not intended). Schneier observes that the
b.c. with hash function protocol you cited has an advantage over the b.c.
protocol with symmetric encryption he describes (v.1,pg.72). Namely, the
hashing b.c. protocol only needs one-way communication after the protocol negotiation. It seems to me that the encryption b.c. protocol he gives can easily be
modified to require only one-way communication (Alice-->Bob). The modified
protocol goes like this:
[0] Alice has a bit b, and generates a secret key K and a random string R.
[1] Alice --- E_K(R, b), R --> Bob
[2] Alice wants to reveal her committed bit.
[3] Alice --- K --> Bob
[4] Bob computes D_K(E_K(R, b)) = (R, b) and checks the value of b (or cries
    foul if R has the wrong value)
This can't possibly be a new idea, but I don't know the literature well enough

Off the top of my head, the figure I have usually heard quoted puts RSA at
about 100 times slower than your average symmetric key algorithm. So ignoring
key setup, I would expect an extra factor of 100 in the brute forcing time
for RSA over IDEA. I don't believe it's worth spending much time worrying about your RSA
key size. If you pick some decent size (1-2k), it's likely that RSA itself
will have been broken, or your key compromised by some other means, before
any direct brute force attack will succeed. Futplex

Could you elaborate ?  I haven't heard of any known interaction
effects between a strong encryption algorithm and a distinct strong digital
signature algorithm (with or without distinct keys), although such an effect
is certainly conceivable. Using "bare" RSA for both encryption and signing, problems can of course arise because signing with a private key amounts to decrypting the plaintext to be
signed with that key. Thus you can be tricked into decrypting some
ciphertext by signing it. But this is the sort of problem addressed by the crypto object format standards like PKCS. No-one recommends using "bare" RSA.
Actually, using separate keys for signing and encrypting is another way to
avoid this issue.

The concept of transferable credentials is awkward because the actual properties described by the credentials often are not transferable from one
object/entity to another. For example, a cauliflower could in principle have a credential certifying that it's a vegetable (according to someone), and transfer that veggie credential to a jackal, but the jackal is still not in
fact a vegetable. I'm still not sure whether it makes sense to have "reputation capital" denominated in an actual currency that can be traded, for the above reason. We might use something like a nym-independent(*) credential statement signed by a certifier and encrypted to the subject of the credential. Pseudonyms and verinyms belonging to various persons/agents/etc. could freely swap around these "rep rupees" with potentially very confusing results.
Since credentials need to be backed up by actual performance when it comes to
a job, such a system might actually be acceptable. I could buy a lion taming
credential with some e$, but everyone would realize that I wouldn't last long
on the job if it didn't describe me fairly accurately. ;)  Presumably a
trustable-with-enormous-sums-of-cash credential would command quite a high
price on the open market.
I am ignoring here the significant gap between the passive reputation accrual
when someone reads messages from a nym, and the active reputation building
involved in handing out credentials. (*) Form letters are handy, but there's the usual tradeoff between the traceability and descriptiveness of the document.

certificates are distributed & managed according to some protocols and policies that are orthogonal to the number of keys in a single certificate.
Things get slightly more complicated if you want to update the encrypting and

 Request-Remailing-To: you
Then you would encrypt that with a remailer's public key, and prepend
the necessary Encrypted: PGP header.  When this message is received by
a remailer, it would decrypt it and send it to you.  It would also send
you any text appended to the end (outside the PGP wrapper).  Thus, using
a reply block, it is possible for people to send you mail without knowing
your real address.
Next, choose a pseudonym and a password.  The pseudonym-address may contain
any alphabetical or numeric characters, or hyphens.  The password may not
contain any spaces.  Then create a message of the following format:
 From: yourname
 Password: Your_Password
 Reply-Block:

 -----END PGP MESSAGE-----
Do not actually indent it.  It is indented here because some people's
mailers try to auto-decrypt PGP messages and this is just an example.
Encrypt this with the following public key and mail it to
alias  Unencrypted mail sent to this address
will be deleted automatically.  If everything is correct, your
mail alias will be created, and you will be sent a confirmation.
If not, there will be no way for the software to reply to you,
so the message will be deleted.  If you don't receive anything,
something is wrong, so try again.  Be sure to test the reply
block first, so that you will know it works!  Also, don't forget
to include the address of the remailer, and the Encrypted: PGP
header at the beginning of your reply block.
Sending in a new reply-block replaces the old one.  To change your
reply-block, just send a new one, using the same format as
the above message.

Well, that "if" is a critical hypothetical. I'm assuming a model in which
people perform most of their legitimate network transactions through Java windows. So I think they will be accustomed to typing financial identifiers or whatnot into windows labelled "Untrusted Applet Window". Many will
become desensitized to the UAW warning label.
I believe the work on authenticating applet servers to client in terms of
signed Java classes, etc. is the most promising long-term approach.
ObNSB: Although I seem to be cast as an opponent of Java adoption in this
thread, I'm actually a fan of Java and expect to write some Java code RSN. Futplex

I don't understand. Are you saying that there's a special benefit to doing
superencryption (GAK encryption over non-GAK encryption) when the GAK layer is Lotus Notes ?

bal quoted from the RSAREF 2.0 license:
Unfortunately this still doesn't explain Charlie Kaufman's comment (paraphrased) that the "crypto software also limited us to 760 bit RSA keys".

(sorry, no discussion of FV or pleasant coffee aromas in this message)
If you are running a broken or Trojan interpreter or class loader, then you're probably sunk regardless, because it can execute whatever deleterious code it wishes. (I say "probably" because I suppose you might have some separate watchdog program monitoring the actions of the interpreter. But ultimately that's just
part of an infinite regress: the watchdog could also be compromised, etc. ad
The I/O class libraries don't offer calls anywhere near as deep as the
hardware keyboard interrupts. About all you can do is read a byte or a line
of input, as in any common programming language, but that's different than
surreptitiously reading bits when they are read as input by some other program. I don't see how you could build a keyboard sniffer in Java unless you could somehow trick the interpreter into feeding an input stream to an
additional process. Much more likely, IMHO, than a Java sniffer is a Java Trojan horse that pops up an innocuous dialog box and asks you to enter some sensitive piece of
information, then sends it off somewhere. About all it takes to write that is
a modicum of skill in user interface design. You could write it in any programming language, but in Java it may be particularly effective, since people may come to expect to be prompted for sensitive info over the net by Java apps. Maybe the Java folks who just left Sun decided to seize the
opportunity ;>

No. You don't need "a wealth of dough/technology" either. Basically you just
need to create packets at a sufficiently low level in the protocol stack.
I'd say it's much easier to use a remailer, but then I'm biased. :)
Indeed, they can have the mail servers under their control emit pretty much
anything. It's nice to be able to launch the packets at a site ostensibly
not under your control, though, so the return path will really be cold.
Well, the sender needs to have some useful encoding of the recipient address.
You can hide the address by encrypting it (reply blocks) or you can use an
address you don't need to hide (nym accounts, newsgroups and mailing lists).
I can't think of any other way to do it right now.
