@_subject: a "real world" anonymous service 
Here's an interesting anonymous service that is almost in the real
world (at least in the sense that Cable TV in general is more
mainstream than most of what we do...)
File: /afs/athena.mit.edu/activity/s/sctv/CROSSLINK.info
What is CROSSLINK?
With over 4,000 cable outlets on and around campus, many many people
can see your message on CROSSLINK.
How long do CROSSLINK messages run?
This type of service is run successfully at colleges all over the
country, and it can be fun to read the messages some people leave.
If you want to find out more about CROSSLINK, please send email
to crosslink
