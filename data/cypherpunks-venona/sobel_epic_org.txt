And EPIC's thanks to Pat Farrell, who actually made the *appendices*
available online as well.  Having found Pat's work, we've now
appended the appendices (?) to our version of the paper.

Through FOIA litigation, we received a redacted version of a Commerce/NSA
document titled "A Study of the International Market for Computer Software
with Encryption."  I subsequently learned that the index of documents in
Ira Sockowitz's safe includes both the unredacted and the redacted versions
of this document.  It is wholly coincidental that EPIC was interested in
the same material as was Sockowitz -- we requested this document and filed
suit for it before any of the events recounted in the Insight article
took place.  In fact, we posted the text of the Executive Summary of the
study at our site in January 1996:
Subsequent litigation resulted in the release of a *less sanitized* version
of the entire study in June 1996.
