Sorry for being one of those who responds to Detweiler's troll...
Patting yourself on the back again eh? I didn't know people as stupid
as you knew how to use email. CFS is Matt Blaze's toy. A toy. When ATT
starts charging money for CFS, then all your bitching and moaning
about ATT _might_ make sense.
Oh, by the way, since when did att "claim" to support linux?
Oh brother,  now I know for sure that this is a spoof. Nobody could
be this lame for reals...

As has been mentioned, this is a good situation for the use of some
kind of escrow. Not meaning to talk about crypto or anything, but it
seems to me that there's already some good shamir sharing code out there,
I hope the overworked, underpaid PGP 3.0 people put shamir sharing
capabilities. I see it as a slight modification of the split/merge
code, which PGP already has, plus already written shamir code that
hopefully need only be cut-and-pasted into PGP.
This is what non-GAK escrow people want, right? Easy-to-use strong-crypto

@_subject: https & encrypted connections 
First of all, let me apologize for not being very knowledgable about CA's
and https and SSLeay, apache, and generating renegade (ie, your own)
certificates. If someone wants to go over this [again] certainly it'd be
I was today playing around with a Mozilla 2.0beta5 that someone gave me
[more bells and whistles than my 1.12, but not much more bang for the buck]
and was showing a friend all the nifty information that netscape tells
about you when you visit sites, then went to c2 to show off the apache
web server and when I tried to use https:// to show off how you can have your
own encrypting web server for free and everything, a window popped up and
said the certificate was expired.
I couldn't really tell if it meant that the certificate that Sameer generated
really needed to be updated, or if Netscape beta 5 had just been rigged to
reject non-netscape certificates, but the end result was no encryption.
(Jeff, if you're reading this, of course we know that Netscape, with it's open
loving policies wouldn't do anything underhanded, but the thought does come
to mind, and by the way, when are we going to see an option to turn off or
control what information is passed out to the other end. Specifically, I'd like
 to come up nearly blank.)
Soooo, anyway, I was wondering if anyone knows anything about the use of
privately generated certificates. Yes, Jeff, we know that Netscape is jumping
to fully support user-specified certificates, but personally I saw, relating
to certificates, a lot of *nifty* options and displays, but really didn't
see much in the way of anything that looked like "add".
...Looking forward to the day where end-to-end encryption is king, and the
TLA, my competition, or anyone else can take their packet sniffer and kiss
my butt.
PS: my predictions on the PRZ-secretly-sold-out-rumor-index: 6.
    my predictions on the IQ of those making those claims:   6. (cumulative)
    woohooo Phil!

@_subject: Re: (none) [httpd finding your identity] 
Does that mean that general-purpose ftp won't be accepted unless the
user gives up their email? Greaaaaaaat... Can't have it both ways, I
guess. What can be added as far as user control; inline vs non-inline,
for example.
The FTP explanation certainly explains why my personal system is able
to confuse the username part of it. And I know there's nothing anyone
can do about the reverse-ip, but what about http referral field? Will
there be a way to turn off (blank, actually) this field?
Jeff, your efforts are certainly appreciated - your ability to get these
things done is most valuable.
Regarding the anonymizer:
First, are there any working anonymizers yet?
Second, is there any ISP that would be willing to give a home to the
  anonymizer?

Hmm, I suppose "Captain Crunch Decoder Ring" doesn't count as a "known way".
Incidently, I read this through nntp.hks.net, which has 75 messages available.
It's been a long time since hks was serving cpunks, I hope this means they're
back up.

@_subject: uh... HELLO?? Was Re: Auto-mail filters and penet-remiler loophole? 
Hasn't anyone here heard of penet's password system? or does your autoresponder
automatically insert your penet password into all your autoresponses???
Even if you only got your penet account on accident, you could at least read
the documentation on it.
