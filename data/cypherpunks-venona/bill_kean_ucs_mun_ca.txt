     shopping database...                     ^               ^
My [BillG] inserted square brackets there...intentional change of meaning, remove the glitch part... related to below. [Comment about the glitch
itself interjected below below.]
Okay. End of that problem. Now then, what's all this:
No they don't.
Let's assume for the moment that I own Safeway. Well, the original author
did mention the guy's name, in a somewhat derogatory way...anyway,
That's MY neat little database there. I can do with it what I want.
What I want to do with it is ..... IRACIS. (Increase Revenue, Avoid Cost,
Improve Service). Actually, if you want to look at a larger issue,
consider working towards achieving your goals, sort of increasing
extropy, as it were, by using intelligent technology... This is not
societal surveillance. Oh, sure, I can sell my mailing lists, and if
my list buyer wants forty year old left handed albinoes who recently
purchased books about cats, then you can be sure she will get them,
and she will sell them again, and the PTB will eventually find out.
Unless, of course, I have in some way assumed an obligation to my
Customers not to do this. The one thing I wouldn't want to do with
my neat little database is piss the Customer off.
Everything is on the record. If you don't want records kept, well, that's absurd... records will always be kept. They wont always
be accessable by those powers you fear, if you do your homework, now.
I know I'M not putting cripple chips in any of my stores. Anyone
caught with tessera cards is fired on the spot, since this is
de facto evidence that you are a government spy. And their name goes into BlackNet...
Okay, let's not be concerned about them - no, wait, they are our
Customers! They will have more money to spend in my stores if they
have enough left after taxes. Gee, if they didn't have to pay so
many taxes, ...
Hey. Cypherpunks, are we all active in our hostility now?
The BlackNet Police are watching you. For extra points, name the dominant hegemonic ideologies of all G7 countries. Sorry if this sounds offensive to you, as I do not wish to offend -
even though I would like to own Safeway...
My own hostility is tongue-in-cheek - but once again, I get to surveil my own cash registers, pos terminals, inventory systems, etc,
and my neat little database knowbot gives me a strategic advantage in producing my income, as well as the income of all those oppressed minions who are forced into employment contracts in my stores,
so you might just as well assume I am going to make use of it. If I don't, someone else will. In fact, even if I do someone else will - they already are.
Trying to exploit some misguided feelings about a glitch because
you feel watched - back to the original threadline for a moment - It seems to me, as a customer, that I want my cheques cleared fast
in the checkout line, just as I want laser bar code scanners. I hate
wasting time looking at chocolate bars. If I don't want them
to know I really do buy chocolate bars and cigarettes and that
is why I gained weight and got emphysema and that is why they
might cancel my government sponsored health care insurance,
and OH YEAH, that's why they use my SmartHealthCard as ID,
well, then, I might just stop writing cheques. Steal your cheques, indeed! Why not just go tell Mr. Wasisname whom you seem to hate so much
that his system could be cracked if someone knew what you know
and hope he gives you a reward for it. I wouldn't recommend blackmailing him...
Back to the newer sub-thread from Julie -
Ciao for now,
Hey, we have already inadvertently given great power to a centralized
government. We - many of us - well, some of us, well, er, I'm sure
at least Tim May and myself, are just trying to get some of it back,
and not to give them any more.
[Actually, Tim and I seem to have given great powers to _different_ centralized governments, eh! You can't get away from them - yet.]

@_subject: Re: BEST Inc. 
What is not clear here is whether the information that comes up on the point-of-sale terminal is encoded on the card or is in their
"neat little database" on the network into which they are tuned.
I don't know, but I guess this might mean that the paper driver's licences we use here in the back woods are soon to go the way of
the buggy whip. The military ID should have been enough - I would
assume that, especially in the largest armed force ever assembled
by man, it is easier to fake a drivers licence than a military id.
But I've been wrong before...
If the info is on the card, follow the refrigerator magnet idea
if you don't want them to cash your cheque. Or do as the Sarge did.
Then, instead of having a record that you purchased Pentouse Letters
on April 14 at 10:33 pm in Mac's Milk on the corner of Broadway
and 110th, they have a record of your withdrawal of 50 bucks from
the atm and a picture in their video database as you did the
withdrawal. Six of one, half a dozen of the other.
If the info is in the database, and it is (even though _this_
pos terminal may not have access to it) then - well, if you object
to this, keep up with cp and other fora, get yourself some fake
or anonymous id's (?), write code, use pgp, become judgement proof,
move and don't set up forwarding addresses, have your id killed, etc.

Subj:   Why Digital Cash is Not Being Used
I believe these things will come into use fairly quickly -
perhaps not as fast as Tim, Hal, others, myself included, want, but.
Especially if the new momentum here in Cypherpunks keeps up.
Allow me to inject some of my own momentum here.
I was going to make a suggestion that this discussion move from
Cypherpunks to IMP-Interest, which seems to be a dead list. Cypherpunks who object to the non-crypto aspect of the Money_Threads
could just not bother with IMP-Interest, and Cypherpunks could take over IMP-Interest and work at actually establishing an IMP.
(Internet Mercantile Protocol). [I might have more to say about
protocols later - but already I sense a long post coming up...]
[[ I don't know if I should apologize in advance for verbosity,
   since there is soooo much mail to read and tend to...but I
   have been holding back for various reasons much related to
   the answer to the Subject: Why Digital Cash is not being used.]]
Or is there something official about the name "IMP" - I notice
the host is on bellcore, do they own the name? Can anyone own a
name such as IMP ? Anything else that needs to be said, in case
of newbies re IMP? Nick Szabo was the one who originally recommended
it, Nick - are you still there?
However, I could be satisfied leaving it on Cypherpunks...actually,
I bet a poll of active C'punk posters and interested lurkers would
approve of the digital cash conversations and the value of money
threads. We'll just have to get Hawk's Ray's ExI Mailing List
new software purchased or donated to Cypherpunks...tax decuctable...
Meanwhile, back to replying to Tim's message and Hal's rallying
of the troops and answering This Question :
Answer Number One to 1. HOMEWORK. Sorry for shouting. There is sooo
much homework to do. We've got code to write, borrow, use...
Personally, I have had PGP for many months, almost a year, I
suppose, and am only now just getting a round tuit. This Cypherpunks
"posting" will be my first public use of PGP to sign a message.
I did send a private PGP message to one friend, just for practice.
I don't have time to read alt.security.pgp enough to not have some
messages expire on me, so I couldn't answer the simple question
of Why does PGP stick an extra "- " in front of the "-----Begin
Public Key Block -----" when you include the ascii public key
block in the text of your letter. Must be a recursion type of thing,
PGP rejecting this particular insance of text as anything significant
to do with PGP signing with cleartxt=on. Anyway, that is perhaps a
faq so I'll recheck that later, ....
So, I've finally got my PGP homework done, at least enough to get
past the basics. But now to get into the PGP Tools and really start
writing code...more homework. Fortunately for you, Tim, you don't
have a Boss to worry about - your dues are all paid in this regard.
Anyway, I'll stick my virgin public key in here, but beware it has
not been signed. I have already volunteered to spring for a phone
call to Stuart Card to check public key sigs, and I'll volunteer
to phone one or two others who reply directly to me to get my key
signed by Known Cypherpunks and/or Extropians.  Anyway, later on
that. I'll probably even PAY someone in digital cash to sign my key...

Subj:	My skepticism/promises WAS Re: Mien Beinkpff
Discussing what
I seem to remember getting a second Errata List posted here.
I guess I don't know much about the _actual_ Netcom... it's just that
so many people have addresses at netcom.com. Perpaps I was misusing it
as a generic commercial account provider.
Thanks for this feedback. And this:
You are certainly correct here. Cavalier, eh! Without wanting to get into this too far as to get off topic and into areas better left
alone, this is just me trying to cure a very long case of bad attitude
(self transformation into a dynamic optimist, as it were...)
and not having succeeded yet. I am cavalier about it because it is
public knowledge, even though I don't have to go spreading it around
myself - but if the truth were known, I have benefitted from the
experience. I think also I must have had a case of the "don't care's"
when I injected just a little too much personal stuff into this effort.
Folks have been asking for action, and where my personal style has not
yet matured enough to be 100% totally professional all the time...
I sometimes open my mouth too far, whereby I insert not only my foot,
but the whole damn leg as well...
Perhaps this is a culture thing...
Yes, and if I sounded too cavalier in using Tim's name in my harangue, sorry - although I was replying to his post.
I'm sure he will let me know if I said anything to offend him.
Well, never say never. I have seen threads I started (which were't
objectionable) go on for weeks long past any input from myself. But,
I guess it is true most of the time. I really wish I could have
attended Extro 1.
..... snip .....
Agreed. Absolutely. The single harangue we are discussing now was not
this convincing that you and everyone needs. It was not meant to be.
It was part dreaming part actual planning part just announcing some
goals part training and part just thinking into the keyboard. Part
of a Just Do It motivation that seems to have crept into my somewhat
defective b-class module cpu-brain (possibly damaged) thing here
behind these eyeballs. Having gone out on this limb, however, there
remains this task I have set myself to explain all this...which
will not be completed before I get some sleep. Well, I guess if I did, it's gone now... Oh well. Not meaning to
be flip - you are right, My reputation has definitely taken some
well deserved hits, and I don't consider it saleable. In deference
to those who dislike smileys, and because I prefer it that way,
I have tried to give up using them.
Well, I suppose it really was a solicitation, if taken word for
word. I may be a fool in many ways, but I really did have tongue
in cheek here. Sorry if I misled or if my lingering depression
coloured the tone of my voice - I for one refuse to go seek out
prozac, for reasons I won't get into.
Well, yes, I think. At least I am well on the way to becoming so...
No. Skip that one. I didn't say '"virtual entity"', I said
'virtual entity', using the word virtual in it's normal, non-buzzword
meaning. It is not real, yet. It is a set of ideas. Now, I know that
ideas are real, but this is too much to quibble over when there is
so much else to do...
Yeah. I did worry about that, but They Already Know Anyway.
I actually thought about encrypting the entire message and
only sending it to Customers, because I really should allow
some paranoia back into my life...but nobody would have bought
it!  And wouldn't you know it, just after posting, I got the
detweiller mail bomb and the message from Tim updating newbies
on that perversion. When Cypherpunks get Extropian/Hawk/Ray code,
tmp will be ::exclude'able.
Sure t'ing, by. Whatever you wants.
I mean in the game of making money, making this workable, profitable,
doable. Costs to Customers. Delivering products and services of value
to them. I have had ths very valid criticism before, and I thank you. I am
not actually seeking investment capital here through anything I may
have said with tongue in cheek. And if a $10 cheque _does_ arrive
in the snail, I will do what I said, which is deposit it in trust
and honour the fact that it does not belong to me. Of if it looks
like the horizons are too far away - Tim says 10 to 20 years? -
I will return it.
Whew! What can I say - of course ! Focusing on narrow ruthless pursuits has
been one of the ongoing problems I have with a sometimes overactive
sometimes lethargic b-class module cpu-brain (possibly damaged).
This concept of polymath - are you referring to something from
a John Brunner novel of many years ago? Is this a word for which
I need more clarification ? Probably some fraction of some small number of litres for each
digital dollar you are paid. Or whatever the going rate is.
Ditto. Actually, the idea of using Girl Guide cookies as exchange medium sounded neat. I order them once a year from my girls, so
those of you with INFO_Banque digital cash you want redeemed, get me your order of cookies by, say, the end of January, and
you'll have your cookies in April. $2.50 Canadian per box,
converted to US dollars. But then again, my girls are soon
to be women, so I'll have to switch to bottles of Barleygreen
or something.
Agreed, of course. The plan is to have my digital dollars, if and
when etc etc, backed by good ole yanqui dollars.
No. I do not have this belief, despite whatever attitude I may
have projected by thinking out loud. Just some practical realities.
Why not! Action, jackson.
First it is noted that I have too high an opinion of myself in
that I have claimed many things I want to do and see happen and
accomplish along my new-found-land, and now I have too low an
opinion of myself because I cannot go out and spend the investment
capital I don't have to do what needs to be done to prevent some
things from recurring that I ought not to have allowed occur in
the first place...
Well, perhaps I am a confused individual. I well recognize the
fact that I am a scatterbrain and that I mix and match my ideas with
those I discover from others, but I am an integrated scatterbrain.
B-class probe modules are self-repairing.
They won't, of course. Some might, assuming some of those interesting
assumptions, for example that some ber of Cypherpunks and or
Extropians and or other people in the world want thave digital
cash available on the Internet and trustable chaumian mixes and
anonymous transactions and so on.
Well, yes. Willing and able are not the same. Of course I wouldn't
expect someone as astute and knowledgeable as he to simply give away
this valuable knowledge. I expect Perry himself is one of these
six-figure guys he has warned us about. And he has hinted once in a while that he is working on new business. He is much more adept
than most people (read me) at keeping his mouth shut when it really
should be kept shut, and is, as far as I can tell, one who knows the difference. Not to mention...
Yes, this is what it is all about, eh.
And finally, I know that. He is probably rolling his eyes upwards and groaning
at this entire response. He has straightened out some goofy ideas
I have harangued about in the past, and, again, not wishing to put
words into the mouth of someone who is so eloquent by himself, he
has expressed the same skepticism of my scatterbrained overambitious
non-focused ideas before. But I have got some of the homework done,
and more is in progress.
I also wish I could say the same of yourself -
oops, sorry...heh heh, of course I meant my self. Thanks for your feedback and help. I know....
But, friends, I am smiling. I may even draft a new version
of the Cypherpunks Quick Code on my next break. There was
an interuption in our feed around about that time - I don't
really know if it ever got through.
And regarding my overambitious, somewhat bubbly stuff about
all the miracles my INFO_Banque will accomplish and my other
businesses will achieve - I refuse to put limits on what I can do. I've been there and done that and it didn't work. Focus, sure,
but limits? That would be non-EC! You want action, so hang on
a minute.
Meanwhile another few dozen messages have come in...Perhaps I
should retire now before sleep deprivation starts a perversion...
and keep asbestos pajamas on when I get up.

@_subject: Sternlight, period. 
I don't know about the rest of you, but there is more than enough
Sternlight shit on t.p.crypto and a.s.pgp for my taste. At least
on newsgroups I can use Kill files, but cypherpunks is mail.
Cypherpunks write code. Sternlight is not code. Cryptography is all economics. Sternlight is not economical.
Time is the stuff life is made of. Sternlight is a waste of time.
Those of you who want to read t.p.crypto, please do. If it is
relative to cypherpunks, okay, crosspost or cc, but with so bloody much mail, I'd rather not have my time wasted by Sternlight stuff.
At least with Extropians mail, I could do a ::exclude, but here
we are defenseless, and the noise level is already high enough what with Detweiller on the way into manic phase again, even if
only tmp'orarily...any chance Cypherpunks will ever get this?

@_subject: Re: Sternlight, Period. 
Many thanks to Cypherpunks who told me how to filter mail
on Unix. I will have to learn unix sooner or later, I guess...
I am on VMS here, and I guess I could have my c/p mail gatewayed
if I wanted to, and then use the news reader. Or recently our
system manager installed Pine, so maybe I could use that. Still,
I could read t.p.crypto too, when I want to, if I want to.
I hope to get a unix machine to play with very soon, with its
own Internet address - even if it's only a 286 box with linux.
We may also get an alpha box sometime this year, and it may
run unix or open-vms. I'll have more control over these machines
than I do over our vax cluster. My own news feed and mail address -
I will then be able to (1) run a remailer and (2) run a reputation
market (3) do some digital cash experiments (4) gateway mail
wherever and whenever I want and (5) set up ftp site/www/home
page stuff, start using secure mosaic, and (6) write some code.
Meanwhile, since I do have a MicroVax at my disposal, - and I should
know the answer to this - can I run PGP on VMS? I don't want to rely
on a timesharing machine to hold my INFO_Banque keys, for example,
but to do some other stuff. Are all the cypherpunk remailers unix
scripts? Our connection to the outside world was recently upgraded
to T1 from 56K, so there is room for more traffic and I wouldn't
mind running a remailer. However, in the longer term I will get my
own commercial site on the telephone company's brand new fiber optic cable to the mainland - it will no doubt be better than T1.

From Tim May :
This happens to me all the time. I quite often see duplicate postings,
too, although the multiple-posting copies of the same message eg
the Chaum ecash announcement was a different problem, possibly caused by the same delay problem - re-posters haven't yet seen the
first copy.
Can't help you there, except provide evidence that it is not a
local netcom problem. Not to say netcom doesn't have local problems...
I am at the end of the world here, at least the corner of North
America. Think of me as your East Coast Sentinel - I can see Signal
Hill from here if I go outside, and I can see Cape Spear from there.
On Signal Hill there actually is one of those posts with arrows pointing to New York, London, Moscow, etc, with all the mileage.
(Maybe I should invent East Coast Sentinal as a pseudonym.) There
are two lines into here for Internet traffic, and perhaps soon to
be others, but except for that, we are the end of the line. Might
make traffic analysis a problem someday.

There has been much Meta Discussion of late.
There has also been much but not too much trivial and meta-meta stuff,
of which I gues I would have to categorize _this_ posting. I don't
suppose anyone is interested in metabolizing this any further...
All I have to do is take a break for a few days and I have these 457 New Messages to catch up on. You all know what I am talking about, I presume. Now that I have lost my job,
and am more or less finished with soaking the hapless taxpayers,
I can finally get around to doing those things I have previously
referred to as homework, and turn them around into revenue generating memes. I am going to unsub for a week or so, and ::exclude all for a while, and unsub permanently from anything
else except moribund IMP - I'll wait to see if anything happens
in that arena - cypherpunks have assumed control over IMP memes
anyway...so that when I get back, there will only be regular
personal mail from net.friends and darters (my secret passion -
a wonderful type A behaviour pattern) mail. I may have only
five weeks of net.access at this address, anyway, but my seniority
and status as alumnus and donor and decus membership entitle me to to historical use of my bill True Name address. I can,
I expect, get a forwarding privilege as part of my severance package,
although I _will_ be going to a commercial internet service as
soon as I get a round tuit. There are other possibilities, which
I wont bore you with right now.
So I'm off to write some code, do some homework, and take some
annual r & r. Before I go, I thought I'd send this rant to the
list, just one message or so before I send the appended .sig in
to the Idea Factory for maintenance.
We have discussed this before, so maybe after my Annual General
Meeting coming up this Perseids, deep in the woods, I'll come up
with an idea of how to make this come about - how to, say, achieve the goal - meanwhile I am just going to rant.
I want Extropian mailing list software equivalent for Cypherpunks!
Others want it. It has been mentioned as a possibility. I understand
there are some intellectual property rights involved, but jesus
h christ as my old man used to say, what can we say about the
intellectual property rights of prz that we now take for granted?
 [Did anyone notice the AP article about prz the other day that
  was okay as a news bite but they spelled his name incorrectly!]
  [[Someone with a much-too-long-but-only-occassionally-used .sig
   also spells his name wrong...homework for another cypherpunk...]]
I understand there are machine property rights involved, too.
Perhaps these can be hashed out at TAZONO. I'll be there in spirit,
if not in the flesh nor by upload...
I know there are other problems, too, but hey, this code has already
been written.
Let's get it done. I haven't yet used the ::exclude features of
Extropian list software for Extropian mail, but I could _sure_
use it for cypherpunk mail.
Meanwhile I am about to unsub cypherpunks for a week, and ::exclude
all for a while, and I'll be back RSN with some non-meta harangues.
Opps, redundancy noted.
Some notes for the future :
Meanwhile, I will be interested in receiving encrypted mail from
cypherpunks and Extropians, just for practice, of course. Very
soon now I hope to get my PGP key signed by somebody, but I
have been waiting a decision on moving to 2.6ui or 2.7...or 3.
Use this public key for now, and we can verify it later in life.
You can check the signature if you wish and let me know if I
have made any blunders.
