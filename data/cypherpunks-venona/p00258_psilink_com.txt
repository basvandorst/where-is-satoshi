@_subject: Request from a new reader. 
I am new to this group and apologize if my request is covered in a FAQ. Would someone kindly point me to an FTP site or the location of a binary application that can be used to encrypt/decrypt text in an MS-DOS environment? I understand that PGP is UNIX-based, unless there is a DOS version of which I am unaware, but that's why I'm reading this group.
Thank you in advance for your help.

Not flame bait in this forum, I hope. I posted a message (very genteel by comparison) in alt.security.pgp and was informed of my ignorance for advancing the theory that legislated standards should always be suspect, lest we lose what little privacy we have left.
If keeping the details of my life out of the government's data maw is anarchy, give me a brick.
PGP key available on request or from the usual servers.
