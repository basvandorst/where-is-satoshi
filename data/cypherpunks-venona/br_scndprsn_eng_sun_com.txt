Yes. And if you also let an intruder in your house, have them sit at
your computer with your newborn child in the room and go on vacation,
things can get really, really nasty.
Sort of like when you execute untrusted code in an untrusted

A couple of posts have raised the issue of doing the FV keyboard-capture
attack using Java.
The only events a Java applet is privy to are those that are typed in
an applet window (and only those it itself spawned). So if a user types
their credit card number in an applet window, the applet could send the
information back to its server (and to that server only). In theory, it is possible to make an applet which appears to be selling
something, get people to visit the page it's on, convince these people
to enter their credit card numbers, and send those back to the server
of origin. Of course, once this happens, you always know what host the
applet came from (unless the thief, in order to get a few credit card
numbers, has hacked DNS so that it's harder to track it).
That's the extent of the risk.

All graphical UI elements spawed by an applet, which are the only ones
that can get user events, are clearly marked as "untrusted applet
So unless you type your password in a pop-up marked "untrusted applet
window", you should be fine. And if you do, you arguably deserve
whatever happens to you....
