I've been off the list for a bit, so I can only guess this relates
to a discussion of the latest CRAM spam.  Detweiler watchers, train
your sights on "nym (Sue D. Nym)", who fairly recently
showed up on Usenet sporting all the usual stigmata.
My take on the Singularity is that it will commence when the
Detweiler cycle devolves to zero length, so that he simultaneously
is obtaining and being booted from accounts on all service providers.
Pretty incomprehensible, eh?

*New* appearance?  Do you mean to say you've been here before?
As L. Detweiler, as an12070, as tmp
But anyway, you're right.  A new e-mail address is a chance for a
new beginning.  I suggested something like this to you when you
showed up as tmp in fact.  But you didn't exactly hold
up your end of the game.  This time, I'm not willing to cut you as
much slack.  Your "BIG COLLISION" announcement and the probably-yours
"WE ARE BLAMELESS AT NETCOM" slander don't encourage me, either.
You're piling up some lousy karma for future incarnations...

Eric Hughes said:
The slowest one I've seen in code is "pick at random until you
get an unchecked element; select it and check it off."  What's
worse is how many people know algorithms that they *think*
generate true-random permutations, but which don't.  They are
sometimes good approximations in practice, but it irks me.
1. Assign a random tag to each element.  Sort on these.
2. The one you responded to: do a large number of swaps.
3. Sort, using a random bit generator as a comparator function.
   (This one is actually in Schneier.)
1. Tag collisions.
2. Asymptotic at best.
3. Counting argument.
Elaboration is left as an exercise, etc. etc.

This isn't something that needs to be argued.  If "Sue" is Larry
and reveals this through his or her actions, so be it.  If he/she isn't,
or doesn't, that's great.  (I do have to wonder, though, who else
would remail messages with Detweiler's "Organization: CRAM" header.)
Actually, we're all T.C.May.
Could you elaborate on what you mean by this?  I doubt many people on
the list think that a full-blown _1984_ is just around the corner.
Some of us are, however, not enamored of Clipper, Digital Telephony,
ITAR, a National I.D. Card, or the like.  I trust this does not
constitute a full-blown "police-state mentality".
Hmm.  I hope millenarianism works better now than it did the first
time around.

No, that's a "kraken".
Uh, no.  "tenracx"?  "rentacx"?
No, Kragen Sittler long predates "Sue D. Nym".  And frankly, I wouldn't
care if he were Detweiler, because he doesn't act like a loon.  You,
on the other hand, are skirting that line.

You know, my reputation system tells me you're a flame-baiting twit,
and a pretty poor one to boot.  Go bother "cypherwonks" for a while.
You'd exercise our reputation systems better if you didn't drop these
broad hints as to your identity.

Tim May said:
My reading of the BSA blurb was that software key escrow really is
being planned: "software implementable [and] based on a non-classified
encryption formula".  Yes, this sounds pretty silly.  I don't see how
you could possibly prevent a rogue phone from interoperating with a
fascistic one.  Guess I need to snarf the original document.

Not through the front door.  But if the system is anything like the
present proposal, there's a lot of room for the key-generating entity
to undetectably keep the keyspace to 40 bits, or whatever it can
comfortably crack.
