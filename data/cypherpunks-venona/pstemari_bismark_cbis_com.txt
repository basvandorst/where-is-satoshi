The credit card swipers send the entire transaction in for both
approval and reporting.  I'd imagine that the account number, merchant
number, and transaction amount are all there, since that's all needed.
Whether or not they encrypt the data I don't know.

Not surprising.  While Dining Cryptographers was vastly more relevant,
I still haven't digested it.  The Rainbow Gathering was good for an
instant response and didn't require anything resembling thought.  I'll
leave it to you to guess which one I saved.
Oh yes, and I at least felt that the Fortran code was on-topic and
saved it for study.

@_subject: Just say NYET to censors 
The fundemental flaw in the comparison of the various Internet and
Usenet based resources is that they are a communications exchanges
between various sources and sinks of information, not a single source.
In this they are more akin to the phone network than a TV station or a
major BBS such as CompuServe or AOL.
I'm quite sure that every parent has a long list of phone numbers s?he
would prefer h(is|er) children would not call, starting off with bars,
escort services, etc.  This is not a justification for a pre hoc
screening of every phone conversation by censors, nor is it a reason
to establish various restricted classes of service for telephones.
This is even more clear in the case of Internet/Usenet resources,
where each link is essentially a contractual relationship between the
computer owners involved.
If you want to establish a site that censors/restricts newsgroups,
limits ftp and telnet access, etc, that's just fine, but it is no
reason to restrict contractual relationships that don't involve you.
If you don't want to connect to a site that refuses to abide by your
restrictions, that's your call.  OTOH, don't expect the world to knock
down your door asking for censored newsfeeds, and don't think you have
some God-given right to insist that two sites independent of your own
abide by your restrictions.
In the case of the major backbone providers, eg uunet and psi, the
situation is a bit different.  These sites have a disproportionate
control of what passes between systems, and any attempt on their part
to restrict content would be disastorous.

I was thinking about this as I thought about the combination of

it stuck me that a denial of service attack could be based on
including a *.test newsgroup in a Reply-To: header, causing the
autoreplies to get posted back into the *.test groups.
Some of the autoresponders seem to be set up to prevent this, others
not.  I don't know if anon.penet.fi is set up to prevent this sort of

CBS, HBO, etc, either already are encrypting their satellite
distribution signals, or they are in the process of doing so. so they
can force people to license the signals for a fee.
The satellite receivers now have provisions for loading a decryption key.

The "trigger" isn't tritium.  Tritium (along with lithium 6) is used
in fusion bombs.  A fission-only device, ala Hiroshima or Nagasaki,
doesn't require any.
The trigger in the center of the plutonium core is a neutron source,
polonium if memory serves correctly.  Tritium is a beta emitter.

No, it is not.  If you had read the message more carefully, you would
have had to phrase your example as, "This is quite similar to saying
that nerve gas is harmless because scarcely anyone who has inhaled
substantial amounts of it has been killed by it."

"Body burden" refers to the amount of Pu that has been ingested and
remains in the body.  The entire point of safeguards is to minimize
body burden and exposure.  If someone has a "impressive body burden",
it means the safeguards didn't work.

What I had heard was the the delays were implemented by varying the
chemical composition of the explosive lenses around the plutonium
core to modify their detonation rate.  This prevents replacing the
electronics to circumvent the security.

That was the entire point.  Having explosive lenses that aren't all
the same defeats attacks on the electronics.

In the illustration on pg 161 of Schneier's Applied Cryptography
(figure 8.5), the regeneration of bytes to XOR with the cyphertext
stream is shown as using decryption.  Doesn't this require ENcryption
in order to produce the same sequence of XOR bytes that was used in
encypherment?

No, I wouldn't say that.  What they're predicting there is that the
massive state will die, smaller groups and cults (ala the Assassins)
will replace it with non-territorial based fighting, and that the
reaction to the abuses of the smaller groups and cults will cause a
popular demand for a resurrection of the big Brother-style govt.
It's an interesting thought, but I don't see that Big Brother is on
his deathbed, which is their starting premise.

Well, perhaps that should read _legal_ wiretaps.  At least one defense
lawyer that I'm aware of over on the Well has asserted that "anonymous
informant"'s are frequently (usually?) illegal wiretaps.  This skews
the economics enormously and simultaneously explains the true
"urgency" of this proposal and the desire for remote LE access
(originally without TPC support).  It also ties in nicely with the
denial of legal protection for violations of key escrow in the Clipper
proposal.
