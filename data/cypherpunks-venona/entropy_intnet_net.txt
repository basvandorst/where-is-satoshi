Extremely.  Speaking as someone who derives particular joy from culture jamming in all of its forms, it sounds like a great thing to do if it is done appropriately.
    It's a good idea; especially since the information is public record an is available from the state government on tape for a reasonable fee.  Unfortunately, from what I've heard from people who actually have the database (for Florida), it works out to be several gigabytes of data, which is unfortunately too large to fit on a CD-ROM unless severely     Perhaps - but it is extremely likely that the local government would take a rather dim view of it.  The DMV record data is probably restricted by some clause or other to non-marketing purposes.  Before trying something like that I would suggest speaking to a lawyer or being willing to have large legal problems.
    This would definately get you thrown in jail and your CBI account killed.  It's a violation of CBI's use agreement and also against the fair credit reporting act.
    I think there's a happy medium where you can shake people up without going to jail in the process.  :)
    Yes.  It's doable, but once again, I would seriously suggest a different approach.

True.  And the fact is, monitoring any _one specific call_ is rather difficult to do without specialized equipment - in my experience with modified analog phones, one has to hop between 50 cells at the minimum before they can hope to monitor a specific call.  I've yet to obtain a digital cellphone to modify, but with the recent legislation about cellular phone monitoring, I wouldn't be surprised if it were more difficult to hack them.  (and just from the size of them alone, I would guess that they're mostly surface-mount, which is a pain in the arse for most people without elaborate facilities)

@_subject: Regarding anonymous debit cards.. 
Yes.  There are also the ``secured'' credit cards where one deposits X dollars into the issuing bank and is allowed 1.5 * X in credit.  Many of these will promote to ``real'' credit cards after a year or some specific amount of charging that's been paid back on time (usually about $1000).  These are a godsend for those who've gone bankrupt; as such I wouldn't be terribly surprised if the issuers didn't even bother to do a credit check until the card promotes, if at all.  If this is the case, what's to stop someone from filling out the application under a pseudonymous identity with a mail drop as the contact address?       It's a great idea - at last year's Siggraph convention I needed to stay in contact with an associate 24 hours a day if need be.  I discovered that in the Kinko's in the Orange County Convention Center there's a cellular phone rental machine, but it took credit cards and the people at the desk wouldn't let me rent one without one - even though I offered to leave my ID and a sizable deposit.     I'm technically not old enough to get a credit card, and regardless of that fact when I spoke to someone at Barnett Bank about getting one and listed my occupation as 'Consultant' she laughed in my face.
   Solution: I got a secured card from a bank in Vermont.  They have $500 of my money in an account, and I have a card with a $500 limit in my father's name.     Without a doubt.  I wonder, again, if the issuing bank even _cares_ who you are if you get one of these secured cards.  There was discussion here about debit/secured cards some time ago - anyone remember the upshot of the discussion?

DH code is easy - using PGP and perl you can build a simple one in a matter of hours.     But: where's the market?  The only people I've ever known to need a 'data haven' were a group of people who'd obtained the source code to a major commercial operating system and used a freenet account and ftp to transfer it.  (40 mB+, I gather).     I can see building one - it doesn't seem at all difficult.  But I don't see how I could be reimbursed for the disk space and bandwidth.

I'll wager most of us could.  Question: whom would you redistribute it _TO_?  This seems to be the stumbling block - who is willing to store the data on their machine or net account?  Speaking as someone with about 300k of quota left, it certainly couldn't be me, though I'd be willing to handle the frontend interfacing work.
   How would you handle retrieval of the data?     Unfortunately I've found that the U.S. government especially can make your life a living hell if you don't go along with their desires, even if you're following all the laws.  Trumped-up charges.  Fake charges.  I wouldn't put much past our government.

Code exists to do all of the things that you've mentioned.
  That was the original point of the discussion.

You've obviously never attempted to get a Windows product working for someone whose previous experience with a computer is limited to "Solitaire".
    I've done work with this ISP, and I can tell you it's nearly the most frustrating experience I've had in my life -- Windows has bizzare conflicts with software eating other software, ports getting set up wrong, and just general nastiness.  Even the slickest software needs helpline time - for whatever reason.
