Ruritania Discovers Motor Transport
Once upon a time in the land of Ruritania (known for
its transparent trees, but that's not today's story)
the population were discovering motor transport.
All kinds of good things became possible then, including
faster and safer deliveries, new kinds of business carried
out over distances (and with that opportunies for foreign
trade) there was a lot of interest in the subject from
far-sighted people.
But the government of Ruritania concentrated on the
problems they imagined plaguing the acceptance of this
technology.  (The government was a democratic one, that
is to say a loosely-related band of popularity-seekers.)
There were cries of how the added speed and load capacity
of these newfangled cars would assist crime.  A few wise
men pointed out that though cars probably would be used
in some crimes, the advantages were still clear.  For one
thing criminals might still be in the minority, while the
people standing to gain would be practically everybody.
Also the cars would prevent much crime.  For example,
people would be harder to attack than when walking home
from the the supermarket carrying 6 heavy bags of food.
They'd load up with other people nearby and be home sooner
and more safely.
The government agreed there were advantages, and
certainly didn't wish to appear backward or oppressive,
by prohibiting mere members of the public from driving.
So a plan was made to permit driving, but with restrictions
to suit the government's wishes.  There was to be a police
officer in every petrol station to record who went where,
when and what they were doing.  Only that didn't suit the
public spending figures (nor probably the chief constables)
so instead distribution of petrol was banned.  Except,
of course, for the petrol vendors who enrolled in the
new branch of the Police force - the Traffic Tracking
Police (or TTP).  Members of this force had a bunch of
qualifications; mainly to do with ensuring that they could
be counted on to report on any traffic they'd observed -
within an hour - to the great guardians of the common good.
Surely nobody could fail to trust the government or any
related body ?  Weren't these the very people who had
defended our health at the risk of their own reputations by
stating that beef was certainly safe before any of the
research was in ? [1]  Or guided us to a right decision in
a promised referendum (on our association with nearby
countries) by not holding it.
This petrol distribution network announced by the
government (though not strictly a government body) was
trumpeted as progress and encouragement, bringing the
benefits of the technology to the public, business, and
anywhere else benefits belong in a democracy.  Sceptics
viewed it as a costly restriction.  People disinclined to
join the TTP, or indeed who failed the in the recruitment
process, were prohibited from supplying petrol (even free
of charge).  Criminals, so it was said, would be tracked as
they bought petrol because they would not be able to run a
black market in the petrol they needed for their crimes.
This looked decidedly doubtful.  The use of the petrol
was also ignored - fixed security lighting by petrol
lamps (hiding nothing, but rather the opposite) was also
restricted by the new progressive legislation.
Nor was that all.  Not content with banning the provision
of petrol, the ban also covered offering it.  The wording
of the act was so vague, causing concerned citizens
to wonder whether answering the telephone would be viewed
as supplying petrol (after all, it could save somebody
a journey).
And what about the scope for crime by people with
access (legitimate or not) to the records of the TTP ?
The legislation had a few things to say about that, but
wouldn't it be safer not to have the records ?
(Like the Ruritanian government had done with records
of polluted sites - look no pollution!)
So it was that Ruritania remained in the 1940's well into the
21st century.

Strong widespread crypto will cut down on much crime in the form of

Date Arrived: 10Sep_19:13:47
I've always regarded it as "We applied for a patent and it hasn't actually
been refused yet, so keep off."
[The following is based on various magazine articles, net discussions etc.]
Until the last year or so (when it harmonised with GATT) US law produced
"submarine patents".  These were patents applied for, subject to a period
of waiting of course, and then (if granted) were valid _from the date of
the application_ i.e. back-dated.  This meant you could quite innocently
find yourself being clobbered by a patent that had only just sprung into
existence.  There were other problems including the US granting patents
to the 'inventor' - rather than the 'first to file'.  'First to file'
is actually a good indication of who the inventor is.  The other scheme
just got inventor-identity disputed by the lawyers.
For a vision of patents as they should be, I know nothing to beat
Phil Karn's web pages.

I agree with the gist of this nightmare view, but don't think it describes
the British TTP proposal very well.
   140 These proposals - aimed at facilitating the provision of secure

               ha ha ha   1122   Encryption services_ is meant to encompass any service, whether
  1123     provided free or not, which involves any or all of the following
  1124     cryptographic functionality - key management, key recovery, key
  1125     certification, key storage, message integrity (through the use of
  1126     digital signatures) key generation, time stamping, or key
  1127     revocation services (whether for integrity or confidentiality),
  1128     which are offered in a manner which allows a client to determine a
  1129     choice of cryptographic key or allows the client a choice of
  1130     recipient/s.
My giving you my key does not provide you with 'choice of cryptographic key or
...  recipient/s' as I read it.  But if I signed your key and distributed it,
that would probably be a certification service (to you) in which you had
chosen the key to be signed.  Also if I gave you 2 keys of mine I think
that would be banned, because you'd have a choice.  This certainly does
discourage effective use, but I don't think the current wording is quite
so dire as to outlaw distribution of a single key.  I'd also say that when
an ISP carries my emailed key to someone they are providing a transport
service, and not a cryptographic one.
The 'or allows the client a choice of recipient/s' looks to me like a direct
reference to remailers.
As to signing non-key material; a service would be if someone I know brought
something (a photo for me to certify true likeness, a will for me to witness
their signature ...) and I signed it for him to indicate something to others.
Signing my outgoing letters is not normally considered a service.  My checking
the signatures on my incoming mail is probably not a service, even if it forms
part of the decision on whether to reply.
As to self-signing a key; it may be permitted following the model of the
above paragraph, or not.  I believe the proposal is deliberately vague for
FUD - and is bad law, regardless of the bad content.  I mentioned the
difficulty of deciding exactly what would be banned by this proposed law

This describes a pure Type 1 without a remix feature.  This idea
due to Andy Dustman allows Type 1 and 2 remailers on the same
host to cooperate, hiding the message size and type.  Another
fault of pure Type 1 blocks when reused is that they are easily
recognisable as the same stage of the same block on different occasions.
You can do sneaky things with cutmarks, but it doesn't buy you much.
You can point your reply blocks to a message pool, so avoiding the
worst effects of Type 1.
You still (even with mixmaster) have the timing issues involved with
addresses that communicate regularly.
Say this when there's a good way to receive anonymous email.
The sooner the better.  Meanwhile all Type 1 remailers should remix.
And as far as fitting ecash into headers is concerned: Ulf and I
think that you could cannibalize the 2nd header to contain the
cash. (We were talking about hashcash in fact.) You'd need to
avoid sending cash to remailers that wouldn't read it, and you'd
reduce the maximum number of hops permissible.  I was meaning to add
hashcash to these remailers.  Lucky's persuaded me not to do it to t1.

nobody (21 Sep 1997)
Has anybody got anything good against this ?  I can get about
1/32 of the state with a simple form of differential cryptanalysis,
but can't see how to progress it beyond that.
My attack takes a long chunk of known text and looks for repetition.
When a two neighbouring p-c pairs are the same you can test
whether they have the same value of a and b.
(That is a_n == a_n+1 and b_n == b+n+1,   a != b usually.)
This involves 16 inputs to each byte - very cheap.
What I really want next is to know "a".
Because c is always known (it's only a counter) if you always knew
"a" you'd have a handle on "b" because only 2 (predictable) elements of
the state array change with each byte encrypted.

Yes (counting only those we test).
This finding doesn't uncover a great deal, I agree, and what it does
uncover is transient.
1 out of 2^16 is the number of pairs we test to find a point
with the property we're looking for.  The measures to compare
this to are:
          message length                 several times 65k is fairly low
          cost of testing                low
          benefit of test when passed    also low  :-(
The changes are regular though, progressing through the array in two
places.  That's why I proposed testing neighbouring p-c pairs because
you can be almost sure the relevant state (and it's which part of the
state array is relevant that's uncertain) is the same for the two.  In
fact it would be nice to spot this:
ccccccccccccccc.22.ccccccccccccccccccccc   and see that a and b were the same, but the underlying
state array changed in a relevant way.  This would be indicated by
a slightly less than total match, but still rare enough not to be
a fluke.  This could allow you to test possible values of a and b,
and perhaps get 4 bits of a.  But a and b don't persist over nearby
bytes so I'm not clear what I'd do if I got them.
What it would be nice to have next is a more damaging result emerge
from this or some other observation so that we could determine more
of the state without going to long range comparisons.  This cypher
is constructed differently from RC4 or fish - not as simple as WAKE
but broadly comparable to Sapphire II.   I think I'll enlist the help
of a search engine.  It's more than likely there other things waiting
to be done to this.  Quor's friend 'nobody' has actually put some crypto
on the list -let's see what we can do with/to it.

How are you planning to detect which bytes are passed in this way ?
Chosen plaintext attacks would do it, and show where (a+b)^(a0+b0) == 0.
Looks like you've just doubled our progress.
If the key is reused with a different message I don't think there's a
weakness.  An IV is a good idea, but aren't we _attacking_ this thing ?
I've grabbed a few search-engine hits and not read them yet.  I'll be
looking for clues there.

Real paranoiacs don't put temporary files in world-writeable directories.
If a hostile user symlinks your majordomo binary (or something)

A single purpose directory /tmp/mdsig writeable only by the

and mode for this directory and parents could be checked by the perl
script before it decides to write there.)

The wording of the original challenge suggested there was a trick to

square rooting (cheap) and using the 2 nearest odd integers was a loser.

Owing to a huge pile of mail messages on Monday (and perhaps my effort to
process them faster by running smap without smapd) some messages to mccain
have had the following destinations:
    ordinary inbox, bypassing procmail
    procmail to the wrong recipe, (you may have received
    an info message)
For both of the above I still have the mail in a backlog of about
200 messages that will be getting sent RSN.
I am unable to determine whether any mail was lost.  Sorry about the
possibility of this, and the delay some messages are experiencing.
I have increased the POOLSIZE of mccain from 3 to 4, and reduced
the RATE from 100 to 90.
The tea remailer does not seem to have hit the same problem, perhaps
attracting less traffic by lower performance stats.

Hashcash in this context suffers from the 'fax effect' - the

I have not (yet) persuaded demon to allow user-defined procmail rules
on the ISP end of the phone lines.  Anybody know an ISP who does this ?
I'll be with them in days if they match the other services I want.
I can't imagine ISPs installing something at all exotic if they refuse
to use procmail.
No loss.
The above paragraph looks like a strange (and IMHO wrong) way to
mix firewall technologies.  If you are passing mail through a proxy
you won't want to either IP masq or lookup DNS records internally.
This means a huge database of who has replied to whom.  Must the
reply have headers indicating In-Reply-To a recognisable message ?

    From Edupage, 18 December 1997:
    <---------->
    TACTICAL SHIFT BY WORKSTATION COMPANIES
    Silicon Graphics Inc.'s plan to allow SGI graphics software to run on
    Microsoft's Windows NT operating system provides new evidence that a
    growing number of companies are giving up on Unix and instead
    standardizing on Windows NT.  SGI hopes to be able to use its
    experience in developing high-end graphics software without having to
    spend a great deal of time building the underlying technology
    represented by an operating system. (Washington Post  17 Dec 97)
    <---------->
But SGI never did put any effort into it, which was why their network
programs were built on 'rcp' and needed fixing if you (horrors) set a password.
I can think of someone possibly suitable for this last bit.

Sorry about this, but I'd really like to see a decrease
in the traffic through mccain and tea from next weekend
lasting the next couple of months.  I'm thinking of helping
this decrease by adjusting the remailer configuration
variables, and restricting the time I spend dialled-up.
In view of the fact that some people will press on anyway
it's probably best if most of you regard these 2 remailers
as temporarily closed.  If you have a reply block leading
through tea, and it gets low traffic, and you can tolerate
extra delay you might wish to leave it in place.
This is nothing to do with the recent modem problem, nor
the size of my phone bill, and I have not been got at by GCHQ.
I have a really good reason for this, and if you knew what I know ...
Hope to be business as usual by late March.  I am not
contemplating a permanent shutdown.
