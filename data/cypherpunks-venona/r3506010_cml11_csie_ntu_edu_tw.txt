@_subject: Question about integrity of Blind Signature 
Hi!
I have some question about ecash protocol. In ecash protocol, we represent
money by a sequence number which is signed by bank. And for privacy, we
use blind signature. But when we send bank a pesudo sequence number--
X*PK(r) (X:sequence number we want, r :random number to cheat bank)
then we can get SK(X*PK(r)) from bank, and get money by SK(X*PK(r))/r=SK(X).
But if we divide SK(X*PK(r)) with r', we can get another money? It confuses
me. How does it preserve the integrity of the money, and let people divide
r on the SK(X*PK(r)) ?
  It confuses me very long time. Thanks for any help!

@_subject: Question about Blind Signature 
I have some stupid question about how to implement blind signature.
I Know it works as follows:
If A wants B to sign X but donot know it is X, A can send
   X*PK(random)  : PK is public key of B
Then B signs on message:
  SK(X*PK(random)) ==> SK(X)*random
Then A can obtain SK(X) by SK(X)*random/random
My question is when I see how RSA encrypts using PKCS
The PKCS block is like this
 00 01 FF FF FF FF ... 00 input
Then SK(00 01 FF FF FF .. 00 input) .
If the input = X*PK(random)
then SK(00 01 FF FF FF .. 00 X*PK(random)) will not produce SK(X)*random
How to solve this??
