Now just WHY do these assholes wast everybodies time talking about something
that everybody KNOWS is unconstitutional?
These fucking lawyers just pull the stunts so they can go and have lunch in a tax-deductable manner, and meet the requirements for some CLE hours that is mandated by the State. This whole affair will be a sham as usual.
This New York Bar has the WORST reputation of any local
association that I know.  Last year they discussed the
legalization of crack and other hard drugs in a "drug-law
revamping" seminar, and Mayor Guliani almost SHIT!
See, the "kid-porn" is the whole fucking issue here, and they
are going to go trying to regulate text because if this concern.
That guy is an asshole. The whole EFF is a joke!
Censorous bastard.
See, this porn issue is diluting everything.
Yes, to get "continuing legal education" credits for
just BULLSHITTING about something these lawyers are all
incompetent at.
Go to this meeting and ask these fucking dumb lawyers how the fuck they expect to enforce a law against US citizens that they cannot enforce against
Canadian or Mexican citizens.  The whole fucking concept of trying to regulate cyberspace by the laws of any one country is ABSURD!
Then ask them if any of them know who tale or speedbump is.
If they do not know that, they have no reason even talking
about cyberspace.
