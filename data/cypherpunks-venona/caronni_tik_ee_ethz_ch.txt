@_subject: SKIP (Security on the IP Layer) Sources 
Hello everybody,
I am not in the cyberpunks mailing list, but I feel you might perhaps be
interested in this:
the Swiss version of SKIP is now available as a pre-alpha source code release
for IRIX, NetBSD, Nextstep and Solaris.
You may get it from ftp://ktik0.ethz.ch/~ftp/pub/packages/skip.
Have fun,
    Germano
Excerpt from the README:
This is ENskip, pre-alpha 0.10. ENskip is a security module for the TCP/IP
stack. It provides encryption, authentication and sequencing of packets on
the IP layer between two or more machines. For more information on the SKIP
protocol, see the Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipsec-aziz-skip-00.txt and
following. You might also want to check  for information
about the background, the protocol itself and future directions of it.
ENskip is pre-alpha. If you are not absolutely sure what this is all about,
you might want to read the draft, and perhaps reconsider using this package.
No bug-fixes, installation help or any other support is granted. If you
have any suggestions, comments or contributions to make ENskip work better,
mail to skip
M. Hauber and Ch. Schneider

Very nice. There are just two little issues:
a) How do you generate the random bytes?
b) How do you transmit them to the other side, without having a secure channel?
In 1940, you needed airplanes to solve b), now you can use PGP (or any other combined strong asymmetric & symmetric crypto) to solve b) and
partially even a), saving you a lot of fuel ;-)
BTW: In my opinion, your 'randomization of bits' corresponds to cyphers, and the way you randomize them corresponds to 'keys'.
My 0.2 cents worth.

Just a short note. The DH patent ( as held by Cylink expires at
the 29th of april '97. Afterwards DH enters the public domain. That's a
certain argument for using DH key exchange. RSA will go into the public
domain somewhen in 2002, if I remember correctly.
