Does anyone remember the problem IBM had back ~10 years on X'mas, when
someone sent an embeded 'script' greeting card to multiple 'profs'
addresses?  When the mail was opened the 'script' procedure was
executed, resulting in the card being forwarded to everyone in the
recipient's address book.  It didn't take too many interations of this
to drag IBM's net to it's knees.
Given JAVA's i/o capabilities, I'm a little concerned about mating it
with my mail reader.

This is not the case for digital imagery. For any given band, if you
sample a significant portion of the image it would not be surprising to
see a more or less random distribution over the range.
If you decrypt with the wrong key, do you get a random distribution?
Would this be the case for all wrong keys? Would the statistics change
in any discernible pattern as the keys got "closer"?
This may give a better result. Most compressions involve a shift to the
frequency domain with a quantization of the samples. You might be able
to write a detector based on this discontinuity.
You could also try throwing an edge detector or some other morphological
recognizer at the output. It would still be cheaper than having to a man
in the loop, but you're going to spend a lot of cpu time.

One more time for the security/cypher-impared (me at least).
I suspect there are a fair number of lurkers here who code for a living
and would be willing to contribute if someone/the_group can articulate
a requirements statement and then push it to the design stage.
I bring nothing cypher-wise. I would be willing to help walk the
s/w-engineering dog and to write Motif/X/socket if the chosen platform
is UN*X, however.
So, from an engineering standpoint, what should the "future" look

Is this worth the complexity/cost? I'd have thought that the amount of
data involved would be small enough that index hashing would be
overkill, and I can't think of any operations that would require a full
up db engine.
Am I missing something?

I don't think this will work. When you
the file will be truncated. Subsequent writes could be anywhere on the
platter; you're building a new file.
I think you can work this way if you open the file for read/write
access, although I'd be more inclined to take the file name into the
directory and then walk the inodes.

Hacker Exposes U.S. Vulnerability
By Pat Cooper and Frank Oliveri
Defense News Staff Writers
Washington -- A U.S. Air Force captain, using a personal computer and a
modem, penetrated the command and control systems of U.S. Navy ships
operating in the Atlantic Ocean, exhibiting the awesome offensive
capability of information warfare and the significant danger U.S. forces
are just beginning to learn how to counter.
Air Force personnel based at Hanscom Air Force Base, Mass., with the
knowledge and permission of the Navy, penetrated the computer systems of
naval ships in the Atlantic Ocean, Air Force Lt. Gen. John Fairfield,
deputy chief of staff for command, control, communications and
computers, said Sept. 25.
Using standard computers, Air Force operators tapped into the Internet,
via a telephone link to the information superhighway, and connected with
a ship through an electronic mail link in one of the ships' networked
computers, Air Force Officials said Sept. 28.
Once inside the ship's computer network, Air Force Operators navigated
to the ships command and control system and could have given the ship
bogus steering commands, Fairfield said.
The methods of the break-in and the actual vulnerabilities it exposed
are classified.

Many thanks.
