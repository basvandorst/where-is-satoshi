@_subject: constitutionlity of mandatory GAK 
Given the current discussion of possibile GAK legislation, you may
want to check out the session from last March's Computers, Freedom,
and Privacy Conference on outlawing non-escrowed encryption.
We invented a manadatory GAK law "Cryptography Control Act of 1995"
and debated its constitutionality in a mock "Supreme Court" hearing
before a panel of real fedreral judges.  The briefs and the oral
arguments (available on the Web in RealAudio format) are an excellent
source on questions of whether mandatory GAK would be constitutional.
The text of the web page is attached below.  The actual page has links
an extensive set of documents.
By the way, watch for the announcement for CFP97, which will be held
March 11-14 in Burlingame, CA.
