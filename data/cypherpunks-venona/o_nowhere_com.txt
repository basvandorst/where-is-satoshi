IF YOU THINK "NOT FOR ME", THEN WHAT ABOUT FOR YOUR FAMILY!
How Many Things Did You And Your Family Go Without This Past Year,
Simply Because You Couldn't Afford Them? Isn't it about time you and
your family got the things you always wanted? Aren't you tired of always
having to tell your family: "Maybe next year we can get that new car, we
just can't afford to take that kind of vacation," "I'm sorry, all I can afford
for you, is junior college," or "look, my boss said he'd try to give me that
raise in 6 months"
THIS PROGRAM IS PROVEN OVER AND OVER, TIME AND TIME AGAIN!
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN IT WORK AND CONTINUE TO USE IT BECAUSE IT DOES WORK!!!
My name is Matthew Forti; I'm a 45-year-old father, and husband. As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk" e-mail and use my account primarily for business.  I received what I assumed was this same e-mail countless times and deleted it each time.
About two months ago I received it again and, because of the catchy subject line,  I finally read it.  Afterwards, I thought , "OK, I give in, I'm going to try this.  I can certainly afford to invest $20 and, on the other hand, there's nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash."  I promptly mailed four $5 bills and, after receiving the reports, paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me.  After reading the reports, I also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free! I was not prepared for the results.  Everyday for the last six weeks, my  P.O. box has been overflowing with $5 bills; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and I've had to upgrade to the corporate-size box!  I am stunned by all the cash  that keeps rolling in!
I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up (and count your money!), you will make at least as much money as we did.  You don't need to be a wiz at the computer, but I'll bet you already are.   If you can open an envelope, remove the money, and send an e-mail message, then you're on your way to the bank.  Take the time to read this so you'll understand how easy it is. Believe me, it works!
                                                       GO FOR IT NOW!
