I guess I would have to ask you why you think hackers would be interested in these projects in the first place?  Your typical hacker would care very little about such a project and in fact may be interested in seeing it succeed.      However, I do feel that you may have a valid point when switching "hackers" to "opponents of the research."  Anyone with an interest in preventing or slowing down the progress in such a project would be more dangerous in my mind than your average hacker.      Preventing that from happening would be necessary if it is decided that such a threat truly exists. Bruce Marshall

that would take interest in disturbing such a project (and have the ability to do so) is very low.  agency perceived as Big Brother, since the hackers would probably see your efforts as a threat. someone working to counteract our efforts.  However, to continue functioning we rate these threats as probable or inprobable and deal with them accordingly.  I don't see skewed results, due to falsifying or tampering with records, as being a very probable threat in the present especially when you are dealing with volunteers.  That threat would increase in magnitude when you start paying people for computer time (as they typically have less of a loyalty bond to you than volunteers would) or if a person would benefit by corrupting the data (such as in the case of a competition).

I think the determination of whether virus software will be considered free speech (and thus legal) or speech needing limits (illegal) will be based entirely on whether that code is active in system memory or just sitting on a hard drive.      The U.S. and many other countries already have laws that make it a crime
to destroy or manipulate data in an unauthorized manner, which active viruses
would qualify as doing.  In comparison to someone shouting "I have a bomb," on
an airplane, this type of speech is already illegal.  However, I would have no problem with people having viruses or virus source code on their own computers or sharing this code with others as long as the receiver is aware of the infective nature of the software.      My guess is that the law will probably pan out in this manner.

First and foremost Congress, then the Judicial system and finally the people themselves.  As far as I know, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act still hasn't been enforced since Congress won't give them funding until better statistics are provided by the FBI as to why they need the ability to place wiretaps so extensively.  I'm sure the reasonability of privacy would come into play with the court system along with who knows what other claims.      Since I'm not exactly sure whether the targets of a wiretap are ever informed that their conversations were monitored if they aren't later prosecuted using the info gained through the wiretap, I couldn't really comment on why if that is the case.      Personally, I think a better example could be used.  When a person is placed under visual surveilance they also are uninformed that their actions are being scrutinized.  Their conversations can be picked up using high powered microphones and they can be plainly seen with binoculars or even night vision goggles.  I would assume that they probably aren't informed after the fact either unless the surveilance is used against them in court.
    Regardless, I think that if people aren't informed that they were the subject of an investigation after they are cleared, they should be.

@_subject: Re: Wiretapping v warrants 
As I do not qualify as a legal historian or expert I don't have any definitive answer for you on this point.  My guess would be that it lies somewhere in the bowels of the legal system.  I recall hearing about some early cases involving operators listening in on telephone calls (which I believe they are still able to do as long as it is random and for purposes of "service checks") and how this was declared a violation of privacy to the calling parties.
    Obviously not a flawless and perfect branch of government, but what is?
    More likely, the "Right to Vote Out the Incumbents."
    I also think the majority of us can look at that and say "what a bad thing."  But the real question is what we want to do about it.
    Throw out the IR gogs then and look at the rest of the picture.  You still have the binoculars, the dish microphones and plain old eyes.  Dosn't this pose a more reasonable comparison to your original topic of    I have a feeling though that IR vision will become more accepted by the courts as a valid means of surveilance as its use increases.
    And unconveinent for those of us who would like to be able to record our conversations without the explicit permission of the other party.
    While that may have been some of their original intentions for passing such a bill, do you think people who are already involved in illegal activities would stop and think "Wait a minute, I can't ILLEGALLY record this bribe,"?  Such blackmails surely continue.
    Well, think about the situation.  The number of people who aren't
prosecuted after a wiretap is likely a small fraction of the whole number of
wiretaps (then again, how do we know?).  The number that find out they were under observation but not prosecuted is even more likely nil.  So, where are your chances to challenge this in court?  Where are the test cases?
Admitedly, Congress shouldn't have to wait for a case to take action to change this practice, but I doubt they are going to make a fuss about it before anyone else does.

Several other countries have very similiar laws.  However, I had heard a somewhat unproven rumor that a U.S. state had actually made the writing of programs with malicious purposes illegal.  Basically meaning that if you write a virus you have committed a crime.  Like I said though, this was just a statement in a message so I can't vouch for the Bruce Marshall

There usually is a pretty apparent line between authorized and unauthorized functions in regards to computer programs.  I don't think that even Microsoft with their pages of disclaimers could release software that, unbeknownst to its user, destroyed data.      I have heard AV people argue that regardless of its purpose (malicious/destructive or not) all viruses can be harmful.  Whether this is simply running the computer out of memory or using bad system calls that result in data loss is irrelevant to them.  I don't quite buy into that argument since we can find the same flaws to be inherent in any software we
run.  However, since you haven't really consciously allowed the program to do
whatever it is doing, the person who infected your machine is typically to be
held responsible for unauthorized access at a minimum.
    Personally, I can see many useful functions for viruses.  But I find the viruses that simply destroy data--which tends to be the majority--to be quite boring and childish.  A non-destructive and innovative virus is very interesting and comparable to any good software hack in my eyes.
    These were not my thoughts as I was only commenting on a alleged law that had been passed.  I agree that we can't look into our crystal ball and see whether Mr. McViruswriter had really intended for his virus to wipe out part of the Secret Service's computer network.  I would wager that if legislators did indeed pass such a law in the U.S., they probably were hammered with the same type of anti-virus propaganda that AV people always seem to be throwing out.

@_subject: Cost of brute force decryption 
Windows NT Magazine ran an article in their May 1996 issue titled "Secure Enterprise Email - How Safe is Your Mail System" that goes into matters of keeping company email private.  PGP and other means of encryption are mentioned along with the following:
information or so that cracking the code costs more than the information is worth, it's 'secure enough.'
time and two weeks to crack.  Although this key may be adequate to protect my checking account, it's probably not large enough for the accounts of a major corporation.
crack and should protect the information for years to come.  A 56-bit encryption key has 2^56-or 72 quadrillion-possible keys.  With 1,000 computers, each trying 1,000,000 keys per second, trying them all would take 833 days.  On average, you find the key halfway through your search.
    I was curious as to what type of formula was used to determine these figures since it wasn't mentioned in the article.  Obviously, the speed of the computers, method of cracking and other such factors would be important to know.  Could anyone shed some additional light on this for me?  Thanks.

Obviously this will depend on what type of computer(s) you are using among other things.  That was what I'm curious about.  Is there some type of rough formula where you could just plug in the different variables (computer speed, speed of each attempt, key length, etc.) and come up with some type of answer.  I was also curious to find out if anyone knew where he had come up with these figures.
