@_subject: Cryptography show for ITR? 
This week's NPR "Talk of the Nation/Science Friday" was on the
internet.  Both telephone callers, and internet "callers" were
accepted.  The show included the founder of Internet Talk Radio.
There was a question along the lines of "how can internet mail
privacy be assured?"  Unfortunately, the experts only breifly
mentioned public-key cryptosystems.  I was wondering if they
would go into a longer discussion about electronic privacy and
crypto issues.
I wonder if we could get a "cypherpunk" onto Internet Talk Radio to
discuss cryptography and it's privacy concerns.  Any ideas?

@_subject: Hmm...hardware secure phone? 
I've been reading up on Codecs.  Motorola has the MC145505 PCM Codec
which samples at 8khz and the PCM output is at 64kbps.  We can then
use the MC145532 ADPCM Transcoder to reduce the data stream to
16kbps.  With the breaks in spoken languages, perhaps we could get
this to compress just enough to go through a 14.4 kbps modem.
Anyway, who knows of a DES or RSA chip which will do 16kbps?
Then all we need is a microcontroller to run the show, and perform D-H or RSA key exchange.

For a broad introduction to information theory, coding, and their
applications in cryptography, I reccommend _Codes_and_Cryptgraphy_
by Dominic Welsh (Oxford Science Publications, ISBN 0-19-853288-1
and ISBN 0-19-853287-3 Pbk).  Some topics: information theory,
noiseless coding theory, noisy channels, error-correcting codes,
source theory, natural language structure, one-time pads,
computational complexity, public key systems (RSA, Knapsacks,
Rabin, Elgamal), authentication and digital signatures
(Diffie-Lamport, Rabin), Diffie-Helman key exchange, and
random numbers and random cryptsstems.

Recently, there has been some talk on here concerning anonymous
remailers and harassment.  I don't think we will ever exist in a society where anonymous information
sources will be eliminated.  Even 50 years ago, the "rumour mill" was
the equivalent of the modern anonymous remailer.  And yes, harassing
rumours got started and hurt people. But the fault, as I see it, lies not so much in those who started the rumour, but more in the people who believed the rumour without
trust in the source.
And that is where cryptographically secure models of trust comes in.
If we are going to continue to be coherent in our future virtual world,
we are going to have to "filter out" information which originates from
sources which we do not have a cryptographic web of trust to.
Does this make any sense?

@_subject: LEEF->LEAF etc. 
I think it is interesting how the Law Enforcement Exploitation Field
has been renamed LEAF.  Good P.R. move NIST!
I'm personally not motivated to believe that Skipjack is a flawed
algorithm, but at the same time I do not consider it tested until
it has stood up to peer-reviewed public analysis.
I am very concerned about the key-exchange system.  As far as I can
see, we still don't know exactly what it is, and whether that is safe.
Public key systems are much more difficult to design securely than
private key systems.  The key exchange has to be secure from eavesdroppers and also proof against "man-in-the-middle" attacks.
Furthermore, there is the traffic-analysis problem.  Everything I have
read so far has indicated there will be a single system key which will
encrypt Clipper serial numbers.  A trivial phone tap with someone
armed with the system key could result in massive traffic-analysis, and the government could do this simply because they have the
system key, the Mafia will follow soon.
I think a good avenue of attack right now is to politically attack
the key-escrow parts of Clipper, and get Skipjack as a published private-key standard.  Write your congresscritters.

@_subject: Our chances 
About NSA assistant director Dr. Clint Brooks:
This is why it is _imperative_ that Cypherpunks develop secure
voice communication systems, to kill Clipper market share.
Of course, the assault weapon issue is, for the most part, a bogus
attempt to grab rifles.  Semi-auto long weapons do not actually
show up in the crime stream with any regularity, there are millions
of legally owned rifles that are never used in crime, and anti-gun
groups are using people's inexperience with semi-auto weapons and
crime statistics to achieve their ends.

@_subject: Cypherpunk Chip 
I suppose the biggest problem with a Cypherpunk chip is
actually getting it designed and built.  I think it is
difficult to imagine anyone with a real job having the time
and money to put it together.  However, it is not out of the realm of possibility for a
graduate project, except one must run the question of whether
there is enough novelty in such a device to make it an appropriate
project.  I'm not sure if IDEA has been implemented in silicon
yet, but clearly it will be more difficult to implement in a
fast way than DES.  Then there is the issue of patents...DES is the only freely
usable algorithm in the concept.  One would probably have to
contact the IDEA people to ensure there are no problems with
us using the technique.  RSA, well, we know the problem there.
Finally, even if implemented as a MOSIS device under NSF or
other grants in a university research situation, we'd have to
find a foundry to go into mass-production.  This would not
be possible without ironing out all legal problems.
Of course, I think PKP might be on our side about Clipper,
and might be very willing to license the Cypherpunk chip
at a reasonable rate.
I've done a couple of analog chips through MOSIS...and no,
my advisor wants me doing silicon models of auditory cortex,
not crypto, but I'll mention it to any incoming grad students
here who want to do some digital stuff.

@_subject: ViaCrypt PGP and source code 
I am sure that businesses will buy ViaCrypt PGP, even for $100.
PGP has proven itself to be a useful and safe encryption
package, and also can do digital signature, a feature not seen
in similarly priced PC security packages.
I think to not release the source code with ViaCrypt PGP is
a serious mistake.  First, I cannot see how releasing the RSA source can be harmful to ViaCrypt.  People can freely
examine PD PGP, I can't see how any trade secrets are going to
be revealed by showing the RSA source.  Perhaps it is slightly
faster, but information theoretic limits show that RSA quickly
becomes lengthy to encrypt, and I doubt PKP nor ViaCrypt have
made any significant progress towards making it faster compared
with PD PGP.
I had to laugh when people suggested the "Clipper-Like" review.
Why is it good for ViaCrypt, but not good for the government?
Let's face it...if ViaCrypt is serious about security, they will
release all source code for examination, and will digitally
sign all programs and have those signatures tracable to a
key on a ViaCrypt owned dial-up BBS.
I understand that there is a contractual problem with releasing
the RSA source.  Perhaps the contract should be re-negotiated.
I will bet ViaCrypt PGP will rapidly become a best-seller if
implemented properly.  There is plenty of money to be made if
everything is kept on the cryptographic "up and up."

@_subject: Easy cracking 
If you found out you could easily crack a commercial "protection"
method, what do you do?
First, you stay anonymous, because otherwise they will try to get
you, no matter what your intentions are.
I think it is best to send the information, anonymously, with a
working example to the company.  But chances are that they will
sit on it due to fear of loosing market share or being sued by
users.  So the question is, is it more ethical to allow the userbase to
have their information cracked by "bad guys," possibly without
their knowledge, or publish the information so that the userbase is
aware of the security breach, and can do something about it?
It depends on the situation, of course.  But no one will believe you
if you say "I can crack xyz programs 'protected' data" without
showing how it works.
When it comes right down to it, individuals have to be responsible about
the cryptosystems they use.  And you are much better off knowing that
your data is possibly crackable rather than not knowing it, and having
hackers crack it without your knowledge.
Hopefully this whole incident will get software companies thinking more
seriously about using scholarly-tested secure cryptosystems.

@_subject: Mugshot Identification Database announcement 
Heard elsewhere...
                 National Institute of Standards and Technology
                           announces the release of
                           NIST Special Database 18
                    Mugshot Identification Database (MID)
NIST Special Database 18 is being distributed for use in development and
testing of automated mugshot identification systems. The database consists
of three CD-ROMs, containing a total of 3248 images of variable size,
compressed with lossless compression. Each CD-ROM requires approximately
530 megabytes of storage compressed and 1.2 gigabytes uncompressed
(2.2 : 1 average compression ratio). There are images of 1573 individuals
(cases), 1495 male and 78 female. The database contains both front and
side (profile) views when available. Separating front views and profiles, there are 131 cases with two or more front views and 1418 with only one
front view. Profiles have 89 cases with two or more profiles and 1268 with
only one profile. Cases with both fronts and profiles have 89 cases with
two or more of both fronts and profiles, 27 with two or more fronts and
one profile, and 1217 with only one front and one profile. Decompression
software, which was written in C on a SUN workstation [1], is included
with the database.
NIST Special Database 18 has the following features:
           of 1573 individuals
           more profiles
Suitable for automated mugshot identification research, the database can be used for:
The system requirements are a CD-ROM drive with software to read ISO-9660
format and the ability to compile the C source code written on a SUN
workstation [1].
Cost of the database: $750.00.
