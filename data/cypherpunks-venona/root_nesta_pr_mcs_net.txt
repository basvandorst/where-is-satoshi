But Dale, hat doesn't matter much.  the user is then going otu of his way tpo get rejected.  The data haven would be knwon to it's users to require encrypted text, and a user who did the scheme you outline above would only be succeding in getting himself rejected.  I mean it's nothe operators fault he decided to be snazzy and put iit in plaintext when it was known to be required to be encrypted, as in knowingly encrypted.

why would you give the haven owner free run?  I mean naturally he does have free run with your data once he gets it, but a matter of trust, and encryption protects you marginally.
it matters alot too me, that's the security of the dat, what if your data is sem top secret plan to bomb the pentagon, and you are using the data haven to distibute to your band of anonymous terrorists, I am sure you woudln't want your data stored ona  public access Unix system, or in you casn do this a number of ways if the datahaven is turned into a data broker, i can pay you for good data otehr would be willing to buy(Blacknet anyone?) or you could pay me for access to data, or for safe secure storage and anon transfer of data to other users.
because it is if you want security, and also to bring in money if that is a motive.
well what would be thepurpose of this data haven you propose except as a extra storage pace for data, like if you dont have space on your own drive?  Your leaving out anon drop boxes, data brokering, or the data haven serving as a center for black markets.

are you saying that there is an agreement between the data haven operator and the user?  If so, that's one of the things i was attmeting to point out in that reply.  I think the agreement, wether it is a contract, not likely, or a sense of trust is extremely important to the data-haven.
Right now were are getting into so many fraggin different definitions of data haven, that this conversation is loopng over itself infinetly.  In one sort of data Haven, the operator does have a responsibility to keep the data private, yet on another, he doesn't have th responsibility, it all depends on what the aims and views and golas of the DataHaven are.  And since we have not yet agreed on what a data Haven.....we get usenet run-around.  this is ties into the above line, maybe you arent just sending encrypted data, maybe your selling secrets to a datahaven operator, who is offshore, or who has the money ot pay you know, and also the structre set up to recieve, transmit, and take payment and pay for that secret data, or valuable info.  Once again I think that we are working with multiple definitions of DataHaven here, adn it is leading to confusions.
ther are already services much better equipped to deal with this problem, although, I am unsure if any of them are crypto-aware as of yet.  Osmthig to look into.

first note that in carol ann's post she previously said it doesn't matter to her how the data is transported, and thus it could be in paintext, I made.  and also that she said that the operator should be able to specify how it was transmitted.
once again we're running with different definitions of data haven.  I see the ata haven as more than just aplace to safely store data if it's encrypted, I see it capabel of alot of other things, like acting as a central point to  BlackNet type operation, with the proper structure set up to carry out the transactions with safety, or relative safety.  also, as a anonymous drop box type of place, I can then send my encrypted data to the data haven, and let them hold it until some anonymous client or eployer and I complete an agreed upon contract and both give word to the data haven to complete it's aprt of the contract, wether it is allowing the other person to now access that encrypted information, or doing a monetary transaction with net-cash or whatever.  Also, as a data base of illegl information, like old credit records and such.
agreed. there are also other operations besides data storage that can be protected by your own crypto, and only use the data haven as a mid-point.
argh, I'm sorry fo the poor typing in this letter, and the other one i sent to Eric ont his subject, it's really late and I am dogged, just got done 9 hours of work.  BUt this topic is so interesting for me I couldnt resist.  Tommorow if I get a chance I will atttempt to outline what *I* think of when I am saying data haven, maybe it will help us be more productive, not that we arent doing that now...
