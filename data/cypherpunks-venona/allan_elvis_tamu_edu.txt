  Does anyone have that ftp address?

Stupidity is it's own virtue.
  If people, who are afraid of fat electrons crowding their email-box,
don't bother to _read_the_manual_ that's their fault.  There's a
wonderful tool called the "filter", that can protect these virtual
innocents from themselves.  Unfortunately, no such device exists
for _real_mail_.  If they don't want email from certain individuals,
then they can put those people into the filter and ignore them as blissfully as they ignore reality itself.
  Just my $0.02 worth.

I don't think e-mail over the Intenet will ever be used in court
since anyone capable of reading the RFC would be able to forge email.
So, anyone could claim that the email being used as evidence is a
forgery _and_ be able to prove it by doing it or demonstrating it.
  At least, I think this would be a way to get it thrown out.

@_subject: Re: Portable TCL-based crypto 
I wanted to trump up a library-like interface using TCL for PGP 2.3[a],
but was told that the "library" will be in the next release.  So I haven't
worked on it.  If the next release of PGP with the library hooks is
<> some extended time in the future, then I'd go ahead
and do it.  But I haven't been able to get any kind of answer or clue
as to when it will come out.
  Anyone know when the next release of PGP is due?  I'd really really
like to have TCL hooks for some projects, but don't want to waste my
time if I'll only have to start over with PGP X.X (where X.X is > 2.3a).

@_subject: The Republic of Desire (anonymous organizations) 
Let's start a new topic, and mr. deitwieler is not invited.
  Has anyone considered how an organization like The Republic of Desire
from Gibson's _Virtual Light_ novel could be created/formed?
  It seems to me that it would be an excellent example and development motive for the crypto-anarchy tools: the DC-net protocol, Zero Knowledge Proofs
used for anonymous credentials, reputation-nets/webs-of-trust, etc. etc.
  My only problem with this is knowing how to organize the "guerilla cell structures" or whatever it was he mentioned.  Anyone have
a ref for something that discusses guerilla cell organizations?

@_subject: Re: The Republic of Desire (anonymous organizations) 
The cell structure of 3 people wouldn't necessarily need to know
the "True Names" of anyone in other cells.  That's what the crypto-anarchy tools are for:  anonymous credentials, DC-nets and
webs-of-trust, digital signatures, etc.   These tools can be used
for "authenticating" the other cells, and communicating with them
without compromising (well... hopefully) your True Name and security.
  Knowing only anonymous Ids of other "persons" in the other cells is
useless to the "authorities".  Unless of course they can get your
passwords and keys and spoof you.  Now how can we make a protocol for
protection against such spoofing?  Some sort of Zero Knowledge proof scheme?

AAAHHH!!!!  EXCELENT IDEA!!!
  Think about it.  It's a beautiful extension to PGP, the "I'm-being-coerced"
password.  Seems to work, but deletes everything irreparably(sp?).
  I don't think the PGP coders will put something like this in,
but the people in my RoD-cell will definately have it as soon as
I'm done. =)

How can they crack down on key-servers running only the keymanagement
code?  I don't think they can, but if they're in cahoots with the FED's then they can do what they want because they have guns.
I'm willing to wager that this 2.6 and maybe 2.5 versions are hacked by the NSA to put in their spiffy key-escrowed backdoor.
Anyone think 2.6 *doesn't* have a backdoor added?

Sounds fine with me.  If Hal, or another agreed upon judge is willing,

Sounds like the UNIX philosophy to me.  :) Isn't this what the forthcoming PGP RFC is about?  Also, what about
the PEM "standard"?  If remailers agree to follow one or more of those
standard data format specifications, then someone could just
ripup PGP and implement modules to produce those data formats.
Consider what CP did with his(her?) PGPTools kit.  As long as we have
an agreeable dataformat "standard", the implementation becomes
irrelevant.  Maybe I'm just confused and not following the thread closely
