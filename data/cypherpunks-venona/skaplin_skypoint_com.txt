@_subject: usenet -> mail gateway 
In view of the situation at CMU and McGill a stray idea crossed my mind. If
someone were to set up some mailing lists which routed the content of the
particular usenet group to the subscribers, this would stymie big brother
to a certain extent. The problem would be that they could possibly block
certain domains from incoming e-mail to thwart this. A solution would be to
dummy up the from address. Daily the address would or could change, thus
frustrating the powers that be. An additional solution would be to throw
encryption into the list software so that each message would be encrypted
to it's recipient, further frustrating the powers. Another concept would be
to daily blast an encrypted packet (SOUP or whatever) to the subscribers of
the list. They could then post replies or follow ups through a mail ->
usenet gateway.

@_subject: Guerrilla Remailers 
Has anyone else given thought to "Guerrilla Remailers?" Basically someone
obtains an account on one of the freenets or similar free account, sets up
a remailer and lets it sit for a while. (Until telnet and/or phone logs
are overwritten) After this time frame the address of the remailer is
posted. The remailer then would be used until it is shut down by the Powers
that be. The account would be set up under a bogus name etc. This would
make the remailer the ideal candidate for the last hop in a remailer chain.
(After all if they can't find Juanna DuBone or Jack Mehoff they can't apply
any pressure to them or hold them responsible. It seems to me the extent of
pressure in this case would be just to shut down the remailer) Just keep a
few ahead and keep leap frogging, as one is shut down another is put on line.
A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on and
licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away.

I've noticed this and always thought it quite strange.
Yes there is...I recent got my fanny pulled out of the fire because I sign
ALL of my messages. Someone spoofed me on one of my accounts. I never got
the full details, but I screamed VERY loudly to the powers "WAS THE MESSAGE
SIGNED WITH MY DIGITAL SIGNATURE." The answer was "NO." My reply was "It
couldn't be me, because my software automatically signs all of my
posts...If I were you I would look at your logs to see who hacked the
message." I never heard another word. Granted this wasn't a really big
deal, but it does illustrate the power of digital signatures. It got them
to at least look at their logs, which probably wouldn't have happened
otherwise. (Even though that SHOULD have been the first place they looked.)
More deletions...
I'm basically a lazy S.O.B. when I first got my shell account I made sure
that my provider had uqwk installed because:
         a. I wanted to use AUTOPGP to sign all of my messages
            automatically because I had been burned several times before on
            forgeries.
As more people get burned, the demand for digital signatures will go up.
This was my initial motivation for installing PGP. The encryption angle
came later.
We might learn something from AUTOPGP. Instead of focusing on making every
reader compatible with encryption, why not focus on making a semi-universal
pre-processor and post-processor for them. Hit the lowest common
Another interesting concept would be for providers to make signatures
mandatory. While you wouldn't be forced to sign your messages, you would be
responsible for any message bearing your name if your software wasn't set
up for signing.
I agree with you Lucky, we have to create a demand. We also have to make it
easy enough for people to implement. There is definitely a stigma attached
to encryption though. Some of you may remember my post a while back about
looking for a place to set up a mailing list, this will demonstrate some of
the forces involved.
A while back I came up with an idea, "Why not set up a public mailing list
to distribute PGP Keys." After mulling it over for a while I decided to do
it. I also came up with the idea of subscribing alt.key-dist to it and also
subscribing a keyserver to it. One stop shopping...post your key to the
list and it makes it to all interested parties. A universal venue for
distributing PGP keys. No system administrator involvement needed, instead
of having to rely on them carrying alt.key-dist, which isn't on a lot of
systems. I went to several providers about setting up the list.
(BTW - Thank You L. McCarthy for your efforts!!!) Everything was great
until they found out what the list was for. After that "Sorry, we can't do
it." or they wanted to charge an exorbitant price for the list. The moral:
A lot of system administrators do not want encrypted messages, because they
fear that they are responsible for the content. While they won't kill
encrypted messages they won't help propagate the technology either. BTW -
I'm still LISTLESS. (I couldn't resist the pun)

It's surprising to me that no one else has touched on this before; it'd
seem the natural thing for those that read 2600.  While the automated
messages are rather annoying when you are making a "legit" post, you can use
this 'service' that Cracker Buster is providing for a bit of net-revenge.
News is easy to forge - the spammer demonstrated that quite handily - and
providing a new 'From:' line to a post that points to your favorite net-
nemesis.  Some on alt.2600 are pro'ly already doing a similiar switch in
order to mis-direct the autoresponses and save themself a headache.  With a
little thought I'm sure that you could generate quite an interesting post
that will have their sysadmin suspicious quite quickly.  Just a thought...
For all of his hypocritical "goods intentions", Cracker Buster has provided
another method to cause all of that damage/destruction/evil/traffic
stoppage that he accuses us of.  *grin*
No, I wouldn't actually suggest that you mis-direct the auto-replies in a
malicious way; a couple of "legit" ideas along this line would be to
screw-up your 'From:' line so that Cracker Buster gets a mailbox full of
returned-mail-bad-address (this I *do* suggest, naturlich!) and to add
your own 'Really-From: realme line with your correct
address so that ppl that _really_ want to get in touch with you can.  Some
variation on the line would be advised -- no need to make it easy for his
responder to handle.  Take a look at the headers on CB's apology post for
more ideas and suggestions.  Pro'ly need a "Sender:" line as well; I'll
know exactly after this post goes thru.

I'm working on the lowest common denominator theory. Maybe they have PGP
set up...maybe they don't. If they do then they can verify the signature.
If they don't they still will have uudecode on their system and can access
the file. Nothing frustrates me more than trying to get a file only to find
out unexpectedly I need something else to access it.

@_subject: Guerrilla remailers revisited 
This idea was buried in the "Rae" thread and I thought it deserved a life
of its own.
As we have found out, the freenets use an interface called "FREEPORT." To
myself and many others this software is a mystery. I am wondering if it is
possible to call procmail via a .forward file under Freeport. If this is
possible, why couldn't someone write a .procmailrc file to sanitize the
headers. If this was written properly, all you should have to do is drop
procmail, the .procmailrc file and the .forward file in place and the
remailer is up and running.
The key here is will freeport call procmail through a .forward file (or
some reasonable facsimile.) The downside is I only have one account which I
am able to run procmail on. This account is presently acting as a
forwarding mechanism for pgp-public-keys and my auto-responder.
Because of this I can't write and debug the recipe.

@_subject: Why I do what I do. 
I had a very telling conversation with my wife today. I was working on some
procmail stuff while she thought I should be doing something else. After
about a ten minute diatribe, she said "I don't know why you spend all that
time messing around with that crypto stuff. What point does it have?" I
responded, "Do you remember when you were a little girl, and you told your
best friend a secret?" She replied with a testy "YES." "All I'm trying to
do is make sure our children will be able to do the same, because with all
the developments lately this may not be possible." After about ten minutes
of silence, I got a very soft "I understand."
The reason I have brought this conversation up is to make a point. You can
have the best technology around, but if people can't relate to the general
concepts involved as it relates to them, the war is lost.

@_subject: Anonymous payment scheme 
This idea just popped into my head, just as I was about to fall asleep.
Being the idiot that I am, I had to get up to write it down. This idea has
probably been presented before...but I haven't seen it here yet.
Let's suppose myself and 10,000 of my closest friends form the First
National Cypherpunk Bank and Trust. We go through all of the hassles in
order to be the issuer of a Master Card or Visa. Now instead of having a
credit line, it is set up as a debit card. The card's limit is how ever
much you have prepaid the bank in advance. Once you have hit your prepaid
amount the card no longer gets approved. Now because everything is prepaid,
there is no risk to me, so I'll put any name you want on the card. The
questions I have are:
Is this legal in the U.S.?
If so, is anyone doing it?
If it's not legal in the U.S., is it legal anyplace else.
If this is a gray area, why wouldn't this scheme work?
If this scheme was set up, it appears to me that the infrastructure for
anonymous payments/netcash is already in place. Of course the issuer would
get a healthy fee for issuing the card...but then again, there truly is
no such thing as a free lunch. As my 10,000 friends and I have no plans to
set this up, feel free to pick it apart at will. (which I'm sure it will

@_subject: Re: Anonymous payment scheme 
I was looking at at the bigger picture. Any merchant who accepts Visa or MC
could now accept anonymous payments. No hassle at all on their part. They
probably wouldn't even know that it was an anonymous account. It fits into
the existing infrastructure very nicely.
A bank in Minneapolis has a similar system in operation. They issue you a
Visa card. That card automatically debits your checking account. The key
would be not to have the card attached to the account. If the card is
attached to any type of account, then there are reporting requirements. A
more apt analogy would be the prepaid phone cards. Walk into the issuing
authority, plunk your $9999.99 on the counter and ask for your card. When
you've spent it all, toss the card.
