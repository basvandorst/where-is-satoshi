The "encryption" built into PMail is - and the author admits
this - crap.  He wrote the encryptor interface, which is
essentially Message XOR Password, as a demonstration.  Then
the JN PGP interface was written.
Mild understatement.

Do we just ignore the fact that these lists are outdated within
seconds of release?  Even if they can be automatically distributed
via the net (maybe by forcing your Web browser to use their page
as your home page and automagically downloading to you a new update),
the list will still be outdated by days or weeks.  This is one of
the big problems with all of these types of filters.
Gee, is this real or simulated violence?  I don't suppose I can
go surfing over to the Mortal Kombat website now...
What about Co$?  They might be a cult, depending upon who you ask.
And, what about us harmless, life-affirming Witches?  The name
alone will probably trigger a lot of filters.
I think the point of all this is that unless/until a "smart" filter can
be devised, there can't / won't be a good filtering package that will
please everyone, or even a majority of someones.  Good luck.

Over the last couple of weeks, I've noticed a lot
of subscribers who PGP clearsign their messages,
but who haven't uploaded their keys to any of
the public keyservers.
Those keys are most useful when they're
available to people who might want to use them,
so I'm asking those of you who haven't sent
them to a keyserver to do so.
(The quick version: paste your key in cleartext
into a letter, sent to pgp-public-keys
with the subject: ADD.  If you don't have it
in cleartext, do pgp -kxa and follow the prompts.)

It certainly _could_ but hopefully isn't.  Let's say that Joel

PI shells out to DOS, and left a snippet of code that mails your
keyID and passphrase to some throwaway AOL account, or a nym address

give to a program, especially one that you know accesses the Internet,
is a potential security risk.

Paranoid yet?  Good.  That's a healthy state to be in.  Fortunately,
most developers (like Joel) don't put any such evil hooks into
their software.  Having access to the source, to be able to read

such things. Reading the source and recompiling it yourself is
probably the best.
Depends on what kind of computer and software you're running.
I'll assume a Windows-style machine.  If we assume that Microsoft
didn't leave any lurking backdoors in their implementation of
wsock32.dll and winsock.dll, and all you run is your usual Web
browser and mail client and you trust _those_ you are probably
safe.  However, if you're running any server daemons on your machine,
such as the MS Personal Web Server or WFTPD or whatever, the possibilities go up _a_lot.  Those programs were designed to let
others access your hard drive, so there's a much higher chance that
they'll let someone get something they're not supposed to.  Again,
if you trust the people that developed your software to not stab
you in the back, you should be alright.

Interesting interpretation.  Mind you, I'm obliged to disagree.
My understanding was that the moderator is supposed to ONLY

There are probably a few hundred of the real addresses on this

Aha, a good point to be brought up: Sandy, are you autofiltering
anyone based on user name, or on certain keywords? Seems to

This much, you can do on your own.  Just filter "zap" messages to
[... using other's pass/zap lists as reputation markers...]
It's a good idea in theory, but would put a lot of load on the server.
For every message * every list subscriber, it has to _at_least_
look up the pass/zap criteria, and possibly do some number-
crunching based on the whole database of pass/zap lists, and keep
track of how long each message has been sitting in the queue
and its ratings by other people.
Also, Mallet could skew the reputations by subscribing with a dozen other
addresses (which M. created just to get the extra "votes"), decide
to have all of them "zap" Alice, and then Bob might never see
Alice's intelligent and thoughtful messages.  (Presumably, Mallet
keeps the bogus addresses subscribed, just dumping all mail into the
bitbucket; any user who leaves the list shouldn't have any weight
in the calculations any longer.)
This also doesn't even address anonymous remailers; Chuck and Dave
