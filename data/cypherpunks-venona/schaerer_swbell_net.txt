@_subject: Best IDEA implimentation? 
A brief scan of FTP sites will result in several different
implimentations of the IDEA algorithm.  Is there any agreement as to the
'best' (Def: easily compiled, syntax that helps prevent dumb errors,
good documentation, relatively quick on most computers, etc)?
If it varies from computer to computer, what would the best
implimentation be for an Intel Pentium running ms-dos/windows95 using
the djgpp c/c++ compiler?
I greatly appreciate any and all help.

--- Since this is my first post, I suppose I should introduce myself
(since I know you all are just dying to learn about me :-) ).  I am a
high school student from Tulsa, Oklahoma, who has had an interest in
cryptography for the last year-or-so.  Needless to say, I have
absolutely no training in cryptography or advanced mathematics -
everything I know comes from books or essays on the aforementioned
subjects.  When I'm not on my computer, music (Classical) is my
past-time.  My primary instrument is the euphonium (think small tuba
with a mellow sound), which I plan on playing through college and

... slavery only to yourself - who made the choice to have children in
the first place?  Once you make that choice, you're stuck with it. That's not a penalty, just propagation of species: you accept the
responsibility to teach your children what they need to know in order
for them to become functional adults, so they may someday do the same. To extend on this 'teaching process', it seems folly to assume that a
child will all-of-a-sudden turn into a thinking, reasonable adult on
their 18th birthday without a certain degree of critical thinking
ability beforehand.
