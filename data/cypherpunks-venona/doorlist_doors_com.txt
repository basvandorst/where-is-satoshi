             STRANGE DAYS HAVE FOUND YOU!
After eight years of printing paper copies of The Doors Newsletter we're now adapting to this new digital format.  Since it's hard to email bulky visuals of what we're talking about, we've set up several web pages that have more information about certain topics. If something strikes you as interesting, by all means check out the pages!  Many of these web pages will not be connected to the rest of our web site and will remain exclusive only for those members of our email list. To fond out more about this list, go to:
We will continue our periodic (snail-mail) mailings which go out to all Doors fans on our mail list, but now that it's not a 3 week job to get these newsletters sent out we're hoping we can keep everyone more up-to-date.

1.  *********  "WILD CHILD"  BY LINDA ASHCROFT
    *******************************************
A new book was recently released in the UK called "Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison" by Linda Ashcroft  (£17.99).  Strangely enough days after copies hit the shelves, they were pulled! Those of us in the States don't have too much of a chance of getting these first editions since right now all the UK copies have either been pulled or sold.  You lucky people in Australia still have a chance of getting your copies though!  But be quick about it because they *will* be pulled there, too!  If any of you have any extra first edition copies (August '97) that you would like to sell please shoot me an email! I'm interested! So, what's the book about?  I talked to Linda and this is what she had to say:
"Wild Child: Life With Jim Morrison" invites you to run with Jim Morrison and me from the summer of 1967 until three days before his death in '71. Drawn from the pages of "Jim said" and "I said" that made it to my diary from the time, "Wild Child" often simply lets Jim speak for himself.  Before he left for Paris Jim told me, "It may have been in bits and pieces, but I gave you the best of me." Jim teased I was the ballast in his life; a "Horse Latitudes" joke.  May "Wild Child" provide ballast for his memories.
I guess when you ask authors for quotes, advertisements are what you get *But* I'm here to tell you more, so crank on the first Doors' CD, song  is a good place to start, and listen up:  This book is a biographical account of a young girl (15 years old) and her experiences with Morrison. Although she admits that, while they never had sex, the two were going to be married when Jim returned home from Paris. They even had their rings picked out at one point.  Whether or not this book has any merit remains to be seen (I haven't got a copy yet), but one thing remains sure... due to what the publishers are calling an "editing error"...the books are not on the shelves in England anymore and are almost impossible to find which makes these first editions instant collectibles.
James Langton (London Telegraph) asked me to help him research an article for their paper. I obliged, only to be repaid by his mis-quoting the name of our magazine in the Telegraph article. (Sorry James, but I hope the rest of your article was more accurate;-) James felt very skeptical about the book because he had an impossible time finding *anyone* to back up the author's seemingly unsubstantiated claims.... In fact, he's still looking. And I'm told that one only has to read the first 40 pages or so to realize why the book was pulled from the shelves.
Whether or not the book's claims are true, *my* only claim (so far) is that these first editions from August 1997 will be worth their weight in gold, not just because of the controversial claims, but also because of the books' limited availability ...and that's a lot of gold considering this is a 549 page book!  What about the second issues?  We'll have to get back to you on this one.
2.  *********************  THE DOORS BOX SET
    *********************************************
It's all over! The Wait is Over!  October 28th, 1997 is the release date!

             Take It As It Comes/Wishful Sinful
All tracks on CD 4 are the released versions. The track order may differ from what is listed here, but the other three CDs are supposedly correct. My personal feeling is that there will be a few surprises on the box set, too. But I guess we'll have to wait and see... Hopefully one of the surprises will be "Paris Blues"?  or maybe even some words from Morrison himself ?!
3.  ********  A CONVERSATION WITH JIM MORRISON
    *******************************************
A new compact disc is now out with a previously unpublished interview with Jim Morrison conducted by Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone Magazine in February of 1970.  Doors historians will note this is right before Jim left for Paris. The 74-minute interview is brilliant. Finally we hear an interview by a professional journalist with some excellent questions!  As a bonus, we hear Pamela Courson answer a few questions as she entered the apartment where the interview was being conducted.
Unlike many European CDs that have been released recently, this one has a quality interview and some seriously delightful insights instead of sad disappointments.  This is the first time I've ever heard the voice of Pamela in an interview, and what a great interview to hear it on! Definitely a CD that is not to be missed! For more information and a list of topics that are covered in the CD, please check out:
4.  *************  THE DOORS COLLECTOR'S MUSEUM
    **********************************************
Ever since The Doors asked our magazine to host a Doors memorabilia review on their video laser disc set, "The Doors Collection"  I've wanted to do a series of web pages on this same topic.  This section will feature both collectibles that are for sale and those that have recently been sold. While our printed magazine features an Auction Review in each issue, this web section will feature underground items that have been bought and sold between collectors. This will give Doors fans the opportunity to see many collectibles that they wouldn't be able to see any other way.
We tried to get this section finished in time for this bulletin, but were unable to get the html finished up for most of the items.  Keep checking  for the latest news about this section!  We do have atleast one web page completed for this list - it is of a very rare collectible that thus far remains unsold. It is...
The Doors very own commercial poster privately printed in August 1968 and sold at two concerts.  They must've sold a million, you say!  No, it was a financial flop.  While artistically designed by Jim Morrison and Paul Ferrara, the poster proved to be cumbersome and very impractical to market. Ray Manzarek himself explains why in his hand written letter of authenticity that accompanies the poster.  Ray estimates that only about 300 of these posters were actually sold making it one of the rarest Doors posters there is!  For more details (Ray's letter in particular) check out:
5.  **********  NEW DOORS "LIVE" TAPES AVAILABLE
    ********************************************
As already reported in The Doors Collectors Magazine  a better than average audience recording of The Doors Madison Square Garden show from  January 24, 1969 has found its way out of the box it sat in for the last 28 years and is available on our trade list. Our copy comes from a DAT of a first generation tape...it doesn't get much better than this! This historic show was a sold out performance to over 20,000 fans!  The Doors had a horn section on stage to augment all the Soft Parade album songs that they performed that night.  Definitely a Doors performance at the pinnacle of their career like no other tape around!  For more on the MSG show be sure to check out the Strange Days home page for a very interesting article written by Bill Tikellis that is jam packed full of details
6.  *****  THE DOORS ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT FOR SALE
    ********************************************
The Doors Collectors Magazine has been commissioned to sell The Doors' original concert equipment including the only gold microphone that Jim Morrison ever used despite what they say at the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame! (But that's another story for our magazine...) These lots aren't exactly for the everyday collector but if you're as big a Doors nut as I am, you might want to stop by and take a look around at:

WELCOME  to The Doors Collectors Magazines
             Strange Days News Emailer! Vol. 2
              The Celebration has just begun:
----For removal instructions, please see end of newsletter----
Today, October 28th, 1997 is the first day that millions of Doors fans will finally be able to get their hands on a copy of The Doors long awaited box set. The media blitz across the nation has caused such a surge on our web site that it slowed downloads down to a halt earlier yesterday. Thanks to the quick response of our ISP (Fibernet, Inc) we have bolstered the site to withstand anything that can hit us today!  Check us out at                   Included in all the promotion is a new three hour long syndicated radio show (Without a Safety Net) about The Doors aired within the last two days and hundreds of classic rock radio stations played Doors block parties all weekend long to honor this auspicious occasion.  Those of you who live in NYC might want to call Tower Records for details because all three Doors will be signing box sets today! For those fans back in Los Angeles be sure to go to the Tower Records on Sunset next Saturday for the same opportunity.   On a personal note: I would love to buy any spare copies of  the box set that are signed by all three Doors, so if you get the chance... why not help me out and help pay for your own box set at the same time! Email me for details at: kerry
For those of you asking about price: The list price is $69 but many large record chains are celebrating the release with special prices... The lowest I've seen so far is $45
Ever since the set list was released ( I've had tons of emails asking questions about the box set...but the one question that I have been asked repeatedly and had no answer for was why the song "Paris Blues" whose lyrics appeared in Danny Sugerman's "Illustrated Lyrics" book was not to be on the box set song line up?  So at the press conference earlier this month, I grabbed the microphone and asked the question.   Ray offered an explanation saying that the song just didn't make the cut. Plain and simple.
But don't worry!   The box set kicks a big ass!  I can't even tell you how excited that I am for the fans to hear some of the incredible tunes represented on the set. PICK IT UP!   IT'S AT YOUR LOCAL CD STORE TODAY!!!!
The WebRing of The Doors which is sponsored by The Doors Collectors Magazine has now skyrocketed to being the 15th largest music related WebRing on the net!  We recently too k out the Hanson WebRing (MmmmBop!  Two thumbs up for this!!!) Check out the WebRing of The Doors at:
The Doors Collectors Magazine ( has made it to the Lycos Top 5% of all web sites!  Check out our site's review below. I think most of it is pretty good!:
This online version of the print magazine contains a trunk full of articles, interviews and beautiful loser trinkets. The Stones have a credit card; the Doors have an e-mail address: doors.com. It's not all just Lizard King worship, either. DCM focuses on the band's music, life and career rather than simply deifying Jim Morrison. True believers can trade concert tapes, check in on tribute bands, and read back issues. Big Picture projects: mounting a campaign to strike Morrison's criminal record for his alleged exhibitionism on a Miami stage. A slavish yet seductive entrance to the Doors web ring. We just updated our on-line memorabilia list with over 150 new illustrations of all kinds of Doors memorabilia!  Never before has it been easier to see what you need before ordering.  Our secure order site makes it safe for you to sit at home and find those hard to find Doors items that you've been looking for. Coming Soon:  An online form for you to submit your want lists to us!

For years I've been trying to get permission to reprint these. Finally I've done it!  You can now obtain quality reprints direct from the masters of their best (and last) two issues (Spring 1992 & Winter 1992-93) for the same $5 each (plus postage) that they originally cost.
