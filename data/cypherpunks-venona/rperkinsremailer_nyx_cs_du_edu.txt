@_subject: Delays & random message order? 
Is it just me or is toad.com delaying messages and sending them out in
random order?  For example, I noticed one post dated 18:00 EST got here
at 19:30 EST.  The next post, however, was timestamped just before noon
(with a received header confirming it was actually received by toad.com
at 11:52 PST)...  Two posts later there is one from 10:30 PST...
My last post took nearly 10 hours to appear on the list, while other
posts are getting thru almost immediately.  I hope Eric hasn't been
experimenting with his no-PGP-sig=delay software; it seems to be stuck
in a time-warp...
Now if we could only get our anonymous remailers to send messages in
this fashion we'd give the NSA a real headache trying to track the
messages. :)
Sorry to nit-pick...(I'm sure Eric has had enough problems with the list
and doesn't need any more) but I thought I was going crazy when I
started seeing responses to posts that hadn't been made yet (the person
had emailed the message to someone, CC: cypherpunks and the response
appeared on the list before the original!)

@_author: something like /usr/mail instead of /usr/spool/mail 
@_subject: MAIL: and re: coming police state 
You can find this document via gopher to chaos.bsu.edu; look in the
"Anonymous Mail" directory for "Next Generation Remailers".
If the remailer is set up properly you should be able to receive your
ordinary mail as well.  Make sure though, the remailers I ran on
rosebud dropped mail because the incoming mail directory was in a
different place (something like /usr/mail instead of /usr/spool/mail).
But I liked this behavior so I left it ;)

@_subject: number theory 
Okay, my memory has been jogged... is this a paper by Pomerance, "On
the distribution of pseudoprimes"?  He gave more precise estimates for
the number of base-2 pseudoprimes.  With his more precise estimates, the chance of a 100 digit number
passing the base-2 pseudoprime test is about 1/10^13...
I think his work applies only to base-2 pseudoprimes, so my statement
concerning the error rate of Miller-Rabin is still correct: for s
iterations, the chance of failure is 2^-s.
