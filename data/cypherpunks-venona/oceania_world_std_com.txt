@_subject: Atlantis Project/Oceania 
Since the subject came up, I'll explain it to those of you who hadn't
heard of the Atlantis Project:
The Atlantis Project is a group in Las Vegas which is trying to build a
floating city in the Caribbean sea.  Their new city would be an
independant nation called Oceania.  The country would have a limited
government, and their constitution outlines many specific rights given
to the people, among them, the right to use cryptography.  You can email
them at oceania and ask for more info.
