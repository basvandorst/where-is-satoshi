Or for that matter, did anyone hear that New Jersey, beginning in 1997, will fully have implemented a drivers license which encloses a computer chip intended to contain medical, legal, etc. backgrounds "and eventually" will be used to contain cash transactions, bus passes, etc.
For the 10% who know of it, let me know more.
For the rest of the list:  it's true.

I wrote David backchannel about this, explaining it in lurid detail.
Now, to the whole list, if you didn't know,
Here's how you STOP the 800 people from getting your number:
DIAL THE OPERATOR and have her put the call through...
Take Care,

Re: Prepaid Calling Cards --
This might work with some telemarketing companies, but I certainly wouldn't be passing on anything of worth.
Especially something which might be construed as "wrong" by any legal While I doubt any telemarketers would go to such great lengths to find out who you are, you are indeed passing along a nice dossier of numbers to whomever the calling card company chooses to disburse such info to.
Be wary.
And for godsakes, if you are that paranoid, use a payphone 50 miles away.
I'd never use a cellular to place a call of importance anyway.
We all know how easily cellular can be intercepted, I hope...  And EVERY number you ever call on a cellular is logged too.
Quid pro quo,

But, as in the case of any PHYSICAL (ie: security box at the bank, blah blah blah) items, at least in escrow, if you DON'T have the key, then you don't get the loot.
If we fight for the same rights, at a minimum, in both the physical AND the electronic forums (and we should have more of both! :)), then this case should be no different than any other case.
"Property goes unclaimed".  That's why lawyers invented wills (or WHOEVER did... )

Oh really?
I got off the phone yesterday with the people who handle my student loans.
It seems they don't "have" a regular number.
It took me about 15 calls on their part, and alot of pissiness on my part
to finally get a local (Ohio) number for them.  Gotta love those collection agencies.
And NO they don't list anything other than their 800 number, and refuse to give it out.
Who is paranoid here?

I'm finding it difficult here, aside from purely technical terms,
to figure out how ecash is really different from using your ATM card
to pay for groceries at the supermarket.
Same Same, only even less secure.

For most companies you can call the library's research section.  As long as you don't have a mean librarian they will usually try to help.
Unlisted ones are another story though (see my previous post)
