10.  You're here about the VOICES, aren't you?
    They *told* me you were coming...
9. Look, pal, I don't even know who the President *was*...
  I mean...*is*...
  Uuhhh...is it 10:15 in DC yet?
8. Do either of you guys know where the 'yellow' wire goes?
7. The First Lady's butt looks pretty good through a 'scope', eh?
6. You must have me confused with my brother, MadDog...the *good* son...
5. Could you put this around my forearm, give it a twist, and then pull
   it really tight?
   Hey, don't bump the spoon!
4. *Which* death threat? Unless you're going to be more specific,
   you're just wasting my time and yours.
3. 'One Bullet, One Vote' bumperstickers are meant as *humor*?
   You're schitting me, right?
2. Next time you're guarding the President at a White House speech,
   do you think you could stand just a tad further to the left?

Yo BadBillyP,
  You know, as a result of the massive amounts of on-topic SPAM/RANTS

(despite the fact that you have a natural advantage, not having spent
six years
 getting through Grade 4, as a result of 'problems' with math),  but
welcome your

  Taoist Synchrinocity being what it is, the moment that I typed
in the Deaf Cons 5.9 chapter heading above, the TV-screen came alive
with the sight of a bunch of half-naked, half-drunk, wholly red-necked
guys named Bubba, BobbingForPigsFeet at the RedNeck Games, in ButtFuck,
Georgia. (Rumored to have been infiltrated, if not organized by, Circle
of Eunuchs initiate Alec McCrackin.)
  The sight of grown men (notice I refrained from using the word 'adults')
bending over head-first in large buckets of water, with their large
ButtCracks showing, with their heads suddenly emerging from the water
with a PigsFoot between their teeth, throwing it on the ground and once
again throwing their heads back into the water, again positioning their
exposed ButtCracks as their most prominent feature...
  Well, let's just say that the press coverage of the RedNeck/ButtCrack
Games was a striking confirmation of the TruthVision that came to me as
my 12-Volt AC/Bulb was lit up by the 110-Volt DC/AnalogueElectronJuice
being emitted from the CIA/Mafia Digital Implant of the PlasticBadge Security
Representative of the Plaza Hotel in Lost Wages, Nevada. MeatSpace Home
of Deaf Cons 6.0, an alleged HackersCrackersPhreaks&Geeks conference at
which no one seemed interested in acquiring a root password into the
RCMP computer system.
  The TruthVision (TM) started building when I realized that I was not,
as my original intention had been, attending the Class Of 1998 Home For
The Criminally Insane Escapee Reunion (although a lot of those attending
Deaf Cons 6.0 seemed to run with the same crowd...if you know what I mean), nor was I at the Young Republican's Convention, my second choice, at which
I hoped to be able to convert some of the more StraightArrow  YouthOfAmerica
into DegenerateBrainDamagedPsychoticShitDisturbers.
  The TruthVision began to Throb&Drip as I realized that the DigitalFreaks
and the EndangeredSharpHackledHackers were paying the same prices fo
DigitalrEvolutionary T-Shirts&Mugs as YoungRepublicans and LargeButtCrack
RedNecks do at their own gatherings.
  The TruthVision began to Pulsate&Squirt, beginning to run down myu leg
and into my shoes, as I my questions regarding the identities of various
individuals at the conference were met with pseudo-suspicious responses,
despite the fact that the RealSpooks (TM) attending the conference no
doubt were in possession of full computer print-outs on all of those wheo
were attending the conference, complete with color-glossies, nID personal and credit histories, names of their dogs and their first and
current boy/girl/friend(s), etc., ad infinituum.
  The TruthVision (TM) ultimately BlewIt'sWad all over my formerly clean
JockeyShorts&LeeRiderJeans as I was being escorted out of the Plaza Hotel,
HomeOfThePennySlotMachines, by an overly-excited SecurityGuard who managed
to impress me with exceedingly serious nature of my 'crime' of having
announced the issuance of a Real&Immediate !!!BOMBTHREAT!!! against the
Plaza Hotel and the Deaf Cons 6.0 Conference, without ever managing to
explain why, if this was indeed the case, I was simply being escorted to
the door and removed from the building, instead of being charged, or held
for questioning, or somesuch, as the building was being evacuated fothe
safety of the hotel's clients and guests.
  The TruthVisionOrgasm was enhanced in a manner very similar to that
provided by the FrenchTicklers sold at TruckStops around the nation, by
the apparently inadvertant revelations of the PlasticBadgeSecurityGuard
in regard to the information shared with Plaza Hotel Security Personell
by ShadowyFiguresFromNonDescriptGovernmentAgencies about my presence at
Deaf Cons 6.0 and personal details of my SorrySordidPersonalHistory.
  In actual fact, the TruthVision Proper (TM) encompasses a lifelong
accumulation of Analogue/Digital Information/Data which coalesced as the
result of the LorenaBobbit of HotelSecurity cutting off my experience of
Deaf Cons 6.0 at the point when the DigitalCounter recording the event
stood at Deaf Cons 5.9, thus forcing myself to use my own imagination and
my F-Finger to FinishTheJob, like a RedNeckBride on her wedding night,
as Bubba gets his nut, rolls over, and goes to sleep.
  The TruthVisionCosmicOrgasm was the rough equivalent of reaching a point
of UltimateEnlightenment, although in a TimeSpaceContinuum inhabited by
Lenny Bruce, Andrew Dice Clay, Howard Stern and Johnny Wadd.
  For all of my CynicalBitching&Whining about the ReptilianNaziSchills
who have made it their life's work to BungHole the Citizenry at every
opportunity, my TruthVisionUltimateCosmicOrgasm was, in effect, the end
result of an endless parade of ReptilianNaziSchills who have crossed my
path in life, who were TrueBelievers in TheVoice which ensured them that, "If you ButtFuck them, they will Cum."

  My SpurOfTheMomentDecision to join Forces (pardon the pun) with the
RCMP in their attempts to villify me was partly the result of an interesting
revelation by the Secret Service during their interview with me, partly
a result of a rather disturbing discovery shortly after my construction
and dissemination of a variety of VirtualNuclearDevices in Southern
Saskatchewan, and a number of other interesting anomolies which led to
WetDream Crescendo during my Deaf Cons 5.9 Jimi Hendrix Experience.
  I had constructed a variety of VirtualNuclearDevices which utilized
such rEvolutionary VirtualConcepts as MasonJars full of water, containing
Metallica tapes/albums, representing HeavyWater, Dildos and Chocolate
Donuts, which served as the PlutoUraniumCynicalAss, soon to become,
by virtue of SyphlitticDecay, a CriticalMass given by excommunicated
GayCatholicPriests who were BadMouthing the Pope, without swallowing.
(As well as a plethora of other Half-Life/Half-Meaningful Cymbals of
AtomicSavagery intended as a SlightlyOverTheHeadOfMentalMidgets HINT!!!
to the RCMP that They (TM) could FuckAllOfTheSheepleSomeOfTheTime, and
FuckSomeOfTheSheepleAllOfTheTime, but, as the Tim C. May Vernacular
Translation of the Bible plainly states, "Truth (TCM) is a TwoEdgedDick,"
and "It is easier for a needle to pass through the scarred veins of
a Junkie, than for a member of a ThreeLetterSecretGovernmentAgency to
pass enough water on themselves to keep from BurningInHell."
Fitting A Round PsychoKiller Into A Square MadBomber Profile:
"Being framed is the sincerest form of flattery."
~Lee Harvey Oswald
  Less than a mile south of the Canadian Border, as I was going through the leather computer bag which had contained the Virtual Nuclear Devices I had
recently dropped off, I found a live ShotGunShell in a container much
like those I had used to construct parts of the devices. I immediately
flashed back to the face of the 'retired' US Air Force Intelligence Agent
who had passed by my house in Bienfait that morning, as I was leaving,
and who seemed unable to look his OldDrinkingBuddy in the eye, instead
casting a GuiltyGaze toward the ground and walking just a little bit
  When the Secret Service dropped a reference to 'gasoline' being a
part of the make-up of 'bombs' being attributed to me in the Great
White Snort, and articles began showing up in the Tucson NewsRags
about mysterious 'gasoline bombs' being discovered in Tucson, I got
the uneasy feeling that the identity of the UnknownIndividual involved
had been decided well in advance of the 'discovery' of the devices.
  After the Secret Service had gone through my truck, with my full
permission, undoubtedly observing the McDonald Observatory pamphlet
that I had picked up on my last TruthMonger SoftTarget Tour Of Ameridca,
an article in the Tuscon NewsRags a few day later pointed out that a
ten-million dollar telescope/mirror was being moved to a more secure
location in order to prevent sabotage. Once again, I could distinctly
smell Villification in the air.
  Everywhere I go lately, from Tucson to Vegas, Nogales to Bullhead City,
I seem to be encountering both Metal&PlasticBadge LEAs who threaten me
with documented instances of my guilt from the Proverbial DogAtLarge
CrimesAgainstHumanity, to a plethora of other Illegal/Villainous crimes
such as Animal Abuse, Bomb Threats, Death Threats, Suspicion Of Intent
To Have A Bad Attitude, EtAl, AdInfinituum--all without ever seeming to
actually have anything to charge me with, per se.   Can you say 'Villification'...sure, you can...
  In 1969, after being charged with possession of a single joint, in
Yorkton, Saskatchewan, I found myself, after having driven for years
without receiving any tickets for traffic infractions, hauled up in
front of the judge who would be deciding my fate on the drug charge,
as the result of a dozen or so minor traffic offenses.
  By the time I went to court on the drug charge, I might as well have
been wearing a prison uniform and holding a MugShotNumberCard under my
chin, since I was more of a standard court fixture than much of the
furniture in the courtroom.
  The more the JackBoot in your back changes, the more it remains the
  While working on the US Customs computer system during the late a970's,
I pulled up my computer profile, with the customs officer watching me
unaware that it was my file, since he knew me only as C.J. Parker.
  When I pointed to a particular notation in the file and asked what
it meant, he laughed and said it was a ThinlyVeiledNotice to those
reading it that, "If you get a chance to Fuck this guy, Fuck him *good*."
  Comforting...
  Things in American Law Enforcement and the American Justice System are
reaching the point where it would be a DogSend to merely have "a few
good men doing nothing," so that Evil would Prevail at a less rapid pace
than it is currently doing.
  The multitude of BadMen doing Evil, yet portraying themselves as the
DefendersOfFreedomAndJustice, has reached proportions where the Citizenry,
were they not so Numbed&Stupified by the DailyTorrents of DoubleSpeak,
DoubleStandards and DoubleDealing by RecognizedAuthority, would rise
up against the ArmedOppressors with such violence as to make the
Somalian people defending their homes and neighborhood against the
ArmedInvaders of the GreatestOppressiveDemocracyInTheWorld look like
schoolchildren playing games.
  Maybe we need to drag the bodies of AmerikanOppressors through
American streets. Maybe we need to bomb our own embassies, at home.
  Maybe we need to defend ourselves against our HomeGrown Oppressors
every bit as Valiently as those in Foreign Lands who must find it
incredulous that our GreatLeaders can express such surprise that
UnGrateful Foreign Wretches shoot back at our troops and bomb our
embassies when we engage in ArmedInvasions of their HomeLands in order to impress upon them that, "We're from a Democratic Government
and we're here to *help* you--EVEN IF IT MEANS KILLING EVERY LAST
ONE OF YOU IGNORANT, FOREIGN SAVAGES!!!"

for serving as SnackFood at CypherPunks Physical Meetings, labeled as
TruthMonger Caviar.]
[Arthur's Right Nut: After having had tens of thousands of dollars worth
of computer hardware and software stolen from me by various LEAs, as a
result of being so uncouth as to refer to the Government Penis (TM) being
inserted into the BungHoles of the Citizenry a 'BIG HAIRY DICK,' I found
it rather amusing to have an attendee of Deaf Cons 6.0 (for *some* of
the people, who made it to the end of the conference) inform me that he
had been following 'The True Story Of The InterNet' manuscripts, and
was disappointed in the "erratic quality of the finished product."
I replied, with as straight a face as possible, that I, myself, had
recently received a SnailMail correspondence from Kevin Mittnick, but
had thrown it in the garbage without reading it, since I found the quality
of the prison stationary it was written on to be substandard.
As well, since it appeared that the BumsRush/NoseFirstIntoThePavement
that I received from Plaza Hotel Security was the result of being
RattedOut for some ImaginedCrime (TM) by a Deaf Cons 6.0 staff member
who somehow felt that I, as a CommonCitizen, was not entitled to provide
the same type of falsified evidence against myself as the RCMP are
currently manufacturing. I was tempted, upon making my exit to suggest
to the staff member that Kevin Mittnick (a Deaf Cons DemiGod) would be
making an appearance later, and should also be RattedOut, in the interest
of preventing the attendees from being cast in a bad light by their
association with him.]
Bottom Line:
"It's a Predatorial Universe..."
  My journey to Deaf Cons 6.0 was actually for the purpose of having a
chat with , in regard to the interest that the Secret
Service seemed to show in my  personal  email correspondence
with him over the InterNet.
  I had actually *gambled* my way to Lost Wages, having had a dream about
Castles and such, then going to the DoubleDiamondCasino in Tucson, and
turning $20.00 into $100.00, on a quarter slot-mnachine with knights and
castles, etc., in order to get travelling money.
  Once at Deaf Cons 6.0, I found out that the individual I was seeking
had short-cropped hair, with an Atom tattoo'd (?) on the back of hisskull.
One of the DoorMen/Staff was kind enough to provide me with an Pass,
in order to help me locate AtomHead. (My lack of success in doing so
might will have been due to my inability to refrain from exercising
my sick sense of humor, informing people, "Tell him that I have a
warrant for him.")
  Having had all of my offers to provide anyone interested with a password
into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police computer system rebuffed, even
having gone so far as to offer disks containing an RCMP BackDoor as prizes
at the conference, I decided to change my plans and just give away the
SonsOfBitches at random, accompanied with the advice that, since the
floppies had my fingerprints all over them, and they contained LjEA
WaterMarks identifying them as disks created on my personal computer
system, they would make ideal 'Evidence' to be left behind at the
scene of "bizarre and meaningless crimes," such as bombing the rubble
the former Murrah Federal Building in OKC.
  My parting words to the BlessedRecipients of my QuestionableGifts was,
"Since the RCMP's attempts to set me up are RatherLame (TM), I figure
that I ought to do what I can to help them out, since, anything they can
do, I can do better."
[Note From The Author:Besides using the conference as an opportunity to
engage in my continuing, tireless efforts at SelfDegradation, I also
took the time to help out one of our fellow CypherPunks, Lucky Green,
who was a featured speaker at Deaf Cons 6.0.
 Realizing that none of the attendees were likely to show much interest
in such a boring and arcane subject as SmartCards, I told everyone I
encountered that Lucky's lecture had been canceled, and that, in its
place, I would be giving a lecture entitled, "How I Broke PGP," although
I stressed that I would not be providing any specific details, because
if I shared the secrets I learned in my Grade 4 math class with just
GodAndEverybody, then EncryptionAsWeKnowIt would suffer a devastating
blow from which it might never recover.
 Although I was given the BumsRush out of the building just as Lucky was
taking the stage, I am certain that he probably weathered the catcalls
and hurled objects quite well, eventually winning over the angry mob that
had gathered.]

Rob Brezsny''s Horoscopes / Week of August 6-12:
Taurus (APRIL 20-MAY 20):Some Jews regard their
houses as a more sacred place of worship than the
synagogue. Many pagans feel no need to confine their
celebrations to any special building, but offer their prayers
to the earth and sky. Several Zen Buddhists I've known
have claimed they're as likely to find enlightenment while
microwaving a burrito under the flourescent lights of a
convenience store as when meditating on a straw mat in a
monastery. In the spirit of these seekers, Taurus, I exhort
you to look for divine inspiration in both the strangest and
most familiar places this week--anywhere other than where
it's "supposed" to be.
  Since I have been OfficiallyExhorted to seek divine inspiration
in "both the strangest and familiar places," I guess this is as good
a time as any to KILL two LarryBirds with one WindowPaneStone, and
seek DivineInspiration in a place that is both strange and familiar
to me--TheOtherSideOfMadness (TM).
  Since my efforts to SaveTheLifeOfAMillionSingleInnocentChildren,
by going to great lengths to research and deal with my various
physical/mental/emotional infirmities to the best of my ability,
have been constantly thwarted by a variety of Officially Recognized
Authorities who have taken it upon themselves to steal and/or deny
me access to the tools and techniques that I use to minimize the
effects of my dsyfuntions and disabilities, I think it is time to
submit to the wishes of the Controllers and cease all efforts to
attempt to exercise control over my dysfunctionality in a manner
that has proven successful, for the most part, to date.
  Accordingly, I hereby serve notice that "I Quit!"
  Since the Contollers seem to find it unacceptable for me to
release the tension that builds in my psyche by screaming the
Truth (TM) about the Villainous Nature of Mounties trained in
the use of ArmedViolence casually slaughtering a FirstNations
mother and the young child clinging to her skirt, for no apparent
reason other than a lack of incentive to resolve a conflict peacefully,
given the fact that whacking out a WagonBurnerBitch and her Future
Young GlueSniffer will inevitably be found justifiable by his RCMP
BumBuddies during their investigation of his murder, then I will no
longer do so.
  Instead, I will just let the SenseOfInjustice ferment inside of me.
  Since Lost Wages LEA's deem it necessary for me to remove the chains
securing my baggage in the back of my truck, in order to chain my dog
'legally' outside of my truck (where it is five degrees hotter than
inside the truck, since I am willing to go without food to provide
her with enough blocks of ice to provide her with comfort and safety),
thus enabling their local junkies to go through my possessions and

wishes for me to drift into unmedicated savagery rather than disobey the letter of laws written by Imbeciles who aren't half as smart as
my dog, Baby, who immediately jumped back into the truck through the
open window, dragging the chain with her, wondering why the fuck these
uniformed Idiots expected her to lay on hot concrete instead of a
nice, cool block of ice.

 vote for Baby as a WriteInCandidate. In her recent TV debate with
Buddy, the FirstDog, Baby told him, "I *knew* Lassie...and you're no

  In effect, given the apparent unacceptability of my attempting to
control the effects of my disabilities with my own time-proven
tools and techiques, I will cease doing so, and allow the Controllers

individuals such as the gentleman who shot his way into the Hallowed

unwanted consequences to the society that I live in, might be met
with joyful enthusiasm.

[Final Note From The Author:If Defcon McCullagh Chainsaw was half the
ReportWhore he claims to be, he wouldn't have to ask me, "Why do you
send your missives to the CypherPunks list?"
The answer, "Because I am a CypherPunk." is the *short* answer.
What it implies, in essence, is that the CypherPunks Distributed
Mailing List is a DigitalGlobalCommunity which reflects what the
InterNet Communities of the Future *should* be.
GeoPhysicallyLocated MeatSpace Communities may reflect the convergence
of people with similar lifestyles and values, for the most part, but
they do not consist of BlackSmith communities in which only BlackSmiths
live, etc.
Just as a foundling country known as the United States of America was
built around the idea of Freedom&Democracy in which the Citizenry was
deemed to have the right to live according to a wide variety of lifestyles,
with diverse religious and secular beliefs, a CypherPunks list that
was founded in the interests of promoting Encryption, Privacy and
Freedom would be a stark landscape, indeed, if it were only occupied
by individuals with a narrow range of attitudes, mindsets, and perceptive
Tim May commented in a post, at one point, that the list was poorer for
the current absence of some of the more statist nay-sayers to the more
common CypherPunks views and positions, particularly those who brought
a modicum of thought and reason to their posts to the list. I enjoyed
firing cynical, acidic salvos at Kent Crispin as much as anyone else on
the list did, but I regarded him as a valuable member of the CypherPunks
community--one who caused me, more than once, to recognize the value
of concepts and ideas that ran contrary to my normal way of viewing
life around me.
Dr. Dimitri Vulis, ShitDisturberExtraordinaire, provided one of the
most poignant moments in CypherPunks History by interpreting his forced
unsubscribing from the list as censorship, and routing around it. I hope
that John Gilmore, one of the premiere contributors to the existence
of the CypherPunks Legendary Lunacy Collective, eventually looked in the mirror one morning and said, "Boy, am I a SillyAss, or what?"
Even the list members who bore us with that mathematical crap, showing
off just because they can count to 21 without taking off their mittens
and their shoes, and pulling out their Dick, contribute to the list, by
making us look good in the eyes of those who mistakenly believe that
there are more important things in life than discussing Ebonics and
pissing all over each other and ourselves.
And where else can a WannaBeNuclearSuitcaseMadBomber ask a simple
question like, "Where do I connect the 'yellow' wire?" and get a
thirty-post thread discussing PlutoniumDecayRates.
Is it any wonder that Robert Hettinga *loves* this list?
In closing, let me remind you that:
"Lassie kills chickens!"
"Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana."
"He who shits on the road will meet flies upon his return."
