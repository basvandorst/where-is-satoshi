On a related note, how does Netscape (or HTTP in general) authenticate using
the password? My best guess, without a sniffer, is (making up error codes as
I go along, but you get the point):
        Browser Sends: GET ...
        Server Replies:  4xx (3xx? 2xx?) Sorry. I need authentication.
        Browser (after querying user): GET along with user-name/password
        Server: ...whatever the page is...
Given that, what allows me to go on and see other (protected) pages on the
same server without being re-prompted? Is it a similar conversation to the
one above or does the browser broadcast the password on every subsequent
request? I cannot ascertain the behavior by going to another site protected
by a different password. Either one is possible. What I'm hoping happens
with multiple sites is:
        Browser Sends: GET ...
        Server Replies:  4xx (3xx? 2xx?) Sorry. I need authentication.
        Browser (after querying user): GET along with user-name/password
        Server: ...whatever the page is...
     (1)Browser (to a different server): GET ...
        Server2:  4xx (3xx? 2xx?) Sorry. I need authentication.
        Browser: user-name/password cached from before
        Server2:  4xx (3xx? 2xx?) Sorry. That's not it. I need authentication.
     (2)Browser (after re-querying user): GET user-name2/password2
        Server: ...whatever the page is...
The broadcast option would change (1) to (2) above to:
     (1)Browser (to a different server): GET along with user-name/password
        Server2:  4xx (3xx? 2xx?) Sorry. (That's not it?) I need authentication.
     (2)Browser (after re-querying user): GET user-name2/password2
Admittedly, the second one is more optimal, but does this mean it would
broadcast the user/passwd to every site? Even the first option winds up
sending wrong passwords to other servers. Does the browser re-prompt if it
detects a new IP address or a different sub-tree of the same server?
Anyway, lots of conjecture (sp?) here. Does anyone know how it really works
or can point me at a reference? Thanks.

Matt, if you're getting paid to read this list, I want a new contract.

Actually, AT&T has us record our time down to 15 minute intervals, which I
obey religiously*. In this case, I'm writing my CP activity off to "People
who can't see a joke without a :-)."

@_subject: Associating Local Port Number to PID 
I'm working on a program for UNIX (SVR4, Solaris 2.4) systems that needs to
associate PID with local TCP/IP port number, so as to pass session keys
accordingly to already running processes. This sounds like such an obviously
needed association that someone must have done it already.
Pointers to code would be best, but any references would be helpful (e.g.,
the appropriate /dev/kmem data structure(s), offset(s), etc.). If necessary,
the program is allowed to be in any group (e.g., "sys" to get at /dev/kmem)
and may even run as root, as a last resort. I see no reason for the latter,
however. Running set-gid to "sys" is sufficient for netstat(1) and ps(1) and
I think is the upper bound for process privilege that I would need.
Thanks in advance.

@_subject: Re: Intl. Keysize Limit vs. U.S. Keysize Limit (Was: Re: Hack Lotus?) 
It would be just as easy to build the intl. version of Notes with 128-bit+spy
Does anyone else find it worrisome that given 24 bits of a 64-bit key, the
encryption may not be as strong as the same algorithm with a 40-bit key
(e.g., for a variable key-length algorithm like RC4)? In other words, I
suspect some algorithms might not derive their protection mechanisms equally
from each key bit. What if guess the remaining 40 bits is as easy as
guessing the rest of xyl******?
Just pondering.

[ text omitted ]
I strongly suspect RSA distributes source to those customers who pay enough,
with the caveat that the customers don't share it, of course. My company
does that, even with its most sensitive code (of course, for a lot of money
:-) ). I find it extremely unlikely (from just a probabilistic standpoint)
that this leak came from within RSADSI.
I would first suspect someone of disassembly, of which I am envious. Not
because I couldn't do it, but because I don't have time to install a new
CD-ROM drive, never mind sit down and read hex dumps and assembler.
My second suspect is a disgruntled or "Crypto Freedom Fighter" employee at
some customer's site. If this is the case and the given anonymous remailer's
(or remailers') integrity is (are) not compromised, good luck to RSA in
trying to prosecute: They're gonna need it.
This horse is out of the barn, down the road, and in the next county.
My one question: Who cares about RC2?
