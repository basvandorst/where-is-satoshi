@_subject: Re: Demagnetizing 
The way the system works at my local library is that there _is_ a strip embedded in the spine and it isn't demagnetized by a quick tap by rubbing it several times over a demagnetizer (there's a big sticker on the side that says not to leave any magnetic storage media near it).   As far as magazines go, my library simply doesn't let people borrow them (which means if it ain't there, it's stolen).  Anyone know how they protect against magazine theft (okay, no crypto relevance.  reply to me and not the list, then).  Later.
