Dear Mr Gordon,
   When I checked the
   digital signature on the Internet death threat using the PGP software
   and JOHNSON'S secret key ring, the computer identified the signature
   as one of the signature keys stored in JOHNSON'S computer. Because
   both the "private" and "public" portions of the "key" were stored on
   JOHNSON'S computer, the message can be authenticated as having been
   generated by the person who possessed this "secret key" and knew the
   correct password. In other words, only the person possessing the
   secret key found on JOHNSON'S computer could have generated the "death
   threat" message.
Why would you claim only one person possessed the secret key? As you
doubtlessly know, some of the TruthMonger secret keys have been posted
to Cypherpunks anonymously. This is not authentication. Thank you.

L. Detweiler and Phiber Optik were concurrently subscribed in early '93.
But you know that, don't you?

Please, try creating a testxxx by direct mail first. Then
upgrade to a remailer chain.

@_subject: Why do we need remailers, anyway? 
Hello? This is an old topic, but what the heck...
There is a concept cypherpunks have called "Blacknet", which is an
organisation that sells profiles of prospective employees based on
their public comments on the Internet.
This allows employers to filter out undesirables who might or might
not have outgrown their rebellious youth. (You can never be too safe!) Now, there are laws making discrimination illegal. But it's hard to *prove*
that an employer based its decision on BlackNet files, isn't it....
The cypherpunk philosophy is to rely on technology to solve the problem, rather
than rely on the government (or anyone else). Cypherpunks write code.

No, I'm questioning why you're telling *me* about it.

@_subject: spy cell organization

    The Central Intelligence Agency like many revoluntionary organizations (including the Russian KGB) organize their agent networks on a "cell" system, with small groups who meet and carry out specific activities.  The small groups have very few connections with the rest of the organization.  Typically, the connections between cells will involve only one person in each cell.  See sample organizational chart prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency for use in Nicaragua by the "Freedom Commandos" (reprinted from Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare, the CIA's Nicaragua manual).
    When this structure is used and a member of a cell is discovered and forced to talk, he can only inform on members of his own cell.  If he was the person with a connection to another cell it is possible that other cell will also be compromised, but only after the connection is traced.  However, the tracing procedure is very slow, giving the organization time to regroup.
    Although the tracing of the cell structure is very slow, intelligence information can be passed to the main organization quickly.
    The main problem with such a cell structure is that the messages which pass through many cells can get grabled and since the cells have great autonomy they sometimes work at cross purposes.
      The CIA extends the cell system to include Police Departments, Labor Unions, Student Associations, Medical Associations, Reporters/Editors etc.  These cells are created by recruiting (or placing) an agent within the organization.  The placement of the agent would depend on the main purpose of infiltrating the organization: information or control.  Usually, most of the people in the "organization" cells don't know that they are working for the Central Intelligence Agency.
    In addition, the CIA controls numerous "private" corporations.  Usually, only a few of the top officers are aware of the CIA connection.  The corporations conduct normal business operations, and are also available to provide services for the CIA whenever necessary.
    A top-secret memorandum from Brigadier General Edward Lansdale to General Maxwell Taylor published in The Pentagon Papers, described "unconventional warfare resources in Southeast Asia" as follows:
                CAT [Civil Air Transport] is a commerical             air line engaged in scheduled and nonscheduled             air operations throughout the Far East, with             headquarters and large maintenance facilities             in Taiwan.  CAT, a CIA proprietary             [corporation], provides air logistical support             under commerical air cover to most CIA and             other U.S. Government Agencies' requirements.              CAT supports covert and clandestine air             operations by providing trained and experienced             personnel, procurement of supplies and             equipment through covert commerical channels,             and the maintenance of a fairly large inventory             of transport and other type aircraft under both             Chinat [Chinese Nationalist] and U.S. registry.
                CAT has demonstrated its capabilities on             numerous occasions to meet all types of             contingency or long-term covert air             requirements in support of U.S. objectives.              During the last ten years, it has had some             notable achievements, including support of the             Chinese Nationalist withdrawal from the             mainland, air drop support to the French at             Dien Bien Phu, complete logistical and tactical             air support for the Indonesian operation, air             lifts of refugees from North Vietnam, more than             200 overflights of Mainland China and Tibet,             and extensive air support in Laos during the             current crisis...
    When the goal is to control the organization, the agent would be in a powerful place, like a Sergeant in a Police Department.  This would enable the CIA to make use of the Police Department resources, computer data banks, officers, etc.
    The police officers might perform surveillance on a target for the Sergeant, not knowing that they were really working for the CIA.  According to Philip Agee/1, "Thousands of policemen all over the world, for instance, are shadowing people for the CIA without knowing it.  They think they're working for their own police departments, when, in fact, their chief may be a CIA agent who's sending them out on CIA jobs and turning their information over to his CIA control".
    Agents in Labor Unions can encourage strikes to cause economic difficulties when the CIA wants to stir up political problems in foreign countries.  Reporters and editors can be used to plant propaganda in the press or have information withheld when its in the CIA's best interest not to have it     When the goal is information collection the target organization would more likely be other intelligence services, medical or technology associations.  The agent would be placed so that he would have access to as much information as possible.  This could be a communications or mail clerk, etc.
    The CIA also targets banks for infiltration.  They are good organizations to provide cover for CIA personnel in foreign countries.  The bank can provide necessary accounts in bogus names.  They can also provide faked account balances so that background checks would out come out positive.  Banks are also used for funding mechanisms.  The Bank of Boston was used for such purposes by the CIA in Brazil/1.
    When the cells aren't aware that they're working for the CIA, or think they're working for someone else, they can be put to other devious uses.  For example, if the CIA controlled a cell which thought it worked for the PLO, they could send it on a terrorist mission with the intent that they be caught.  This would have a two fold advantage for the CIA, first, the PLO would be blamed (providing a good opportunity for the U.S. government to expouse propaganda against the PLO), and secondly, it would allow the CIA to commit a terrorist attack with extremely little risk of exposure -- to achieve a greater level of
interference in the affairs of foreign governments.
    The CIA can also use cells within an organization which aren't aware of their connection to the CIA for less devious purposes.  For examples, they can make public statement which have the effect of alienating their supporters.  When one section makes offensive public statements, major disruptions can occur within the organization.
