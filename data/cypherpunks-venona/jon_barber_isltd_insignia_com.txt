About time too.  I recently had a run in with a local bike mechanic  and had to stop a cheque for 650 pounds.  However, my cheque  guarantee card is also a Visa card, and so the scumbag filled out a  Visa slip using the details on my cheque - without my permission of  course.  This was successfully paid to him by Visa.
However, I told my bank what had happened and they freaked.  It seems  I'm definitely going to get the money back after about 3 months (!!).   The bank were very embarrassed and want me to tell the police as it's  a criminal offence.
It's always struck me how people could easily fill out Visa slips  from discarded receipts, get the money and split.
