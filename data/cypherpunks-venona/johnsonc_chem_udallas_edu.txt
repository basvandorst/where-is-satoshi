I'm just wondering if anyone knows whether or not (1+4k) can be written as the sum of squares or not, and if so, what the proof of that is?   Anyone care to share?? Thank you, Carrie Anne Johnson What? Because I kill indiscriminately? -Tom Servo

haha... cute.  oops, I guess I forgot an essential part of the problem....
that should be "If (1+4k) is _prime_, can it be expressed as the sum of
squares? If so, what's the proof of this..."
  btw, for technicalities sake, let k be a variable!! cute matt ;)
 thanks again....
