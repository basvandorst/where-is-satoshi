Over 2000 years ago, Nostradamus predicted that on Tuesday November 14, 1995, Phil would say:
I'm betting your bet is right. When you set up your persona/nym for use with the CheckFree wallet, the software does ask for those four, non-embossed numbers on the Amex card - which I had never really noticed 'til then. And I frequently pass the amex number on the phone for business stuff.
Just last week, I had flowers sent to some partners of ours that we had just completed a deal with (sorry...should have odered them over the net), and the 4 "flat" numbers were not required.
Hmmmm ....

Lucky writes (quoting propaganda forwarded to Punks by Robert):

Not all merchants wishing to transact on the Web are as knowledgeable or sophisticated as the Punks on the different options. The offering includes a Web presence and payment processing, hassle free. No energy expenditure required. No need to develop an instant competency in electronic commerce. If a prospective web merchant has neither in place, I imagine the cost might be attractive. I also imagine that, like any other business in the world, SBT charges what they think the market will bear.
Please note that CheckFree did not price the offering - they do the CC processing for SBT at some agreed upon cost to SBT. SBT sets the price for the offering in order to recover that cost, as well as their own, and establish some sort of margin.
And by the way, I had nothing to do with project, so I beg you not to direct flames thisaway, should any decide flames are called for. Hey man, I just work here....  :)

@_subject: Mitnick Road Show 
Saw a teaser last night for Friday's broadcast of the Stone and Pauly show. Looks like they're doing a piece on Mitnick. They did not mention him by name, but used some of the epitaphs commonly associated with Mitnick since Markoff's Cyberpunk. Which makes sense, since most of the viewing public doesn't know Kevin Mitnick from Steve Jobs.
I just hope this piece is better than the infamous Unsolved Mysteries treatments. I am not holding my breath.

Multimedia Business Analyst via Individual Inc. : NTT has developed a
secure electronic cash system for smart cards and  Internet-based
transactions, reports Reuter. Using very secure  encryption algorithms, the
system allows users to transfer cash from  their bank accounts to smart
cards after verification by the issuing  bank.
  NTT researcher Mikio Suzuki said the Japanese telecom operator plans to
begin trials of the system with a number of major city banks in the  near
future. These are expected to include Fuji Bank and Sakura Bank.
