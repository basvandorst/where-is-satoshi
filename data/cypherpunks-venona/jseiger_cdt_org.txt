jim
If you read our statement, you will see that we agree completely with EFF &
Jim that the new crime is unnecessary and needs to be addressed.
As for the second issue, I understand EFF's concerns, and this is
definitely an issue that needs further clarification and discussion. But
you should note that the bills do not in any way impose key escrow (and
only the Senate bill contains these provisions anyway).
In fact,the legislation does precisely the opposite in two ways:
1. The bill explicitly affirms the rights of Americans to use any form of
   cryptography they choose domestically.
2. By directly attacking export controls, the legislation undermines the only
   lever the Administration has in imposing Clipper and Clipper II. The Clipper
   and Clipper II policies are based on the assumption that the market in most
   cases will support only one version of a particular crypto application.
   By encouraging only the export of cyrpto w/key escrow mechanisms, the
   Administration believes that they can force the domestic market to adopt
   escrow as well. This has not worked yet, but it *has* forced a stalemate
   has led to a very little privacy and security for the Net.
   By undermining the only leverage the Administration has for left to impose
   key escrow domestically (beyond an explicit effort to ban it
outright), these
   bills effectively remove the current threat of a government imposed domestic
   escrow crypto policy, and allow the market for strong cryptography to
   flourish.
So again, CDT believes that this legislation represents the best
opportunity we have had yet to provide the Internet with the privacy
protections and security it desperately needs. There are most certainly
areas that we would like to see changed and/or clarified, but that should
not overshadow the important opportunity these bills represent.

I will point out that as things stand under U.S. law you aren't even
allowed to export toilet paper if the expectation is that the ultimate
customer is on the extreme bad boys list. Although as a libertarian I
find any such provision distasteful I cannot see that we are badly off
if the rules for exporting crypto and exporting toilet paper are
roughtly similar.
I think that is key.

@_subject: More on the latest Surveillance Bill... 
The outline below is from a document produced by the House Republican
Conference.  It is ONLY A SUMMARY of the proposed bill and is NOT actual
legislation.  No one I have spoken with has seen any specific legislative
language yet.
The outline is confusing on several points, particularly the "FBI DIGITAL
TELEPHONY" Section, which says:
 "The bill authorizes the FBI to use enhanced telephone technology to
  investigate suspected terrorist activity.  Funding for equipment purchase was
  provided in the 1996 omnibus appropriations measure enacted earlier this
  year."
The first sentence above is not at all clear, and probably won't be until
we can get our hands on the actual text of the bill. It could be additional
wiretap authority (ie, roving wiretaps), or it could be nothing.  As far as
the funding goes, the "1996 omnibus appropriations measure" DID NOT contain
funding for implementation of the law - but it did appropriate $37 million
to cover new equipment for the FBI.
The rest looks like it is a scaled back version of a measure the
Administration and members of Congress were pushing earlier this week, but
the scope of the new bill depends a lot on what the actual text says.
I will post additional information as soon as I get it.

                         To Be Introduced
Floor Situation:
The House is scheduled to consider HR__ on Friday August 2, 1996. On
Thursday August 1, the Rules Committee granted a rule to allow the bill to
be considered under suspension of the rules. It is debatable for 40
minutes, may not be amended, and requires a two-thirds vote for passage.
HR__ includes several bipartisan initiatives intended to bolster federal
efforts to combat domestic terrorism in addition to those already enacted
earlier this year as part of the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132).  The bill contains the following
counter-terrorism provisions:
Aviation SECURITY MEASURES: The bill enables domestic airports to
aggressively search for and prevent explosives from causing destruction and
harm to individuals or property through enhanced explosive detection
procedures, baggage and passenger screening, and FBI authority to improve
airport security training and standards to ensure that provisions of the
1990 Aviation Security Act (P.L 101-604) are implemented expeditiously.
Specifically, the bill (1) requires the FAA to implement increased
explosives section methods immediately, (2) strengthen the level of
training and expertise possessed by security personnel who are assigned to
domestic airports, (3) allows airports to use available funding to
reinforce such training for security personnel, and (4) extends criminal
background requirements to include a greater number of airport employees.
IMPLEMENTATION OF EXISTING ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS: The bill urges
implementation of provisions enacted in the 1996 Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132), such as designating and
freezing the assets of foreign terrorist organizations and implementing
expedited removal procedures for aliens convicted of a crime.
BIPARTISAN "BLUE RIBBON" COMMISSION: The bill establishes a special
commission to review all aspects of U.S. anti-terrorism policy and make
legislative recommendations about methods to most effectively establish a
long-term defense against terrorist threats, including enhancing the
nation's human intelligence capabilities.
PRIVACY ACT AMENDMENTS: The bill includes provisions which grant a cause of
action against the U.S. if in the course of a wiretap investigation
damaging information is willfully disclosed to the detriment of an innocent
party by the federal government.  The cause of action includes monetary
damages to the plaintiff if a favorable decision is rendered in federal
EXPLOSIVES STUDY: The bill authorizes a study on black and smokeless powder
by an independent agency selected by the National Institute of Justice.
FEDERAL RACKETEERING STATUTE CRIMES: The bill permits federal prosecutors
to deem those acts determined to be terrorist in nature as substantial
enough to invoke criminal prosecution under existing criminal racketeering
(RICO) statutes.
FBI DIGITAL TELEPHONY: The bill authorizes the FBI to use enhanced
telephone technology to investigate suspected terrorist activity.  Funding
for equipment purchase was provided in the 1996 omnibus appropriations
measure enacted earlier this year.

@_subject: Latest info on the "counter-terrorism" bill 
The House passed a revised counter-terrorism bill this afternoon by a
substantial majority.  The bill is expected to be considered by the Senate
on Saturday 8/3, and is likely to pass.
The House-passed bill DOES NOT contain ANY of the privacy threatening
provisions.  Provisions dealing with funding for the Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (Digital Telephony) were REMOVED from
the bill just before the vote after civil liberties groups AND the FBI
objected to the language. Provisions dealing with emergency wiretap
authority and "roving wiretaps" were also not included in the House-passed
In addition, the bill does not contain any encryption provisions. Earlier
in the week, the Administration had circulated an outline of their
anti-terrorism proposal which included new, unspecified restrictions on
encryption.  Senators Burns (R-MT), Leahy (D-VT), Pressler (R-SD), Lott
(R-MS), and others worked hard to prevent any encryption provisions from
being included in early versions of the bill, and deserve a lot of credit
for fighting for the Net. It's nice to finally have a number of powerful
allies joining the usual defenders of net.freedom on Capitol Hill.
The bill passed today contains provisions increasing airport security,
studies on ways to improve US anti terrorism policy and other terrorism
issues, and a controvertial provisions expanding federal racketeering laws
to cover terrorist activity.
The bill also contains a small but not insigificant privacy victory. The
bill doubles the punishment from 5 to 10 years for unlawful disclosure of
information obtained from a warrant and increases certain penalties for
violation of the Privacy Act.
This is not over yet -- many of these issues, particularly encryption and
Digital Telephony funding, are likely to be back before the Congress in
September, so stay tunned...
Thanks to everyone who called Congress today to object to the new sweeping
surveillance provisions that were dropped from the bill! It looks like we
mave had really made a difference in this debate.

I think this is a good idea for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is
that it would help define our issues for the Congress, the Administration,

because we are not as well organized as we could be, the perception of the

This idea could help to change that attitude if it is done right.
I remember 2 years ago (I think?) VTW did something like this.  As I
recall, the only issue was Digital Telephony, and every member of Congress
(save 2 or 3) got an F. IMHO, this was not as effective as it could have
been, but it was a good start.  Our issues are much more front-and-center
than they were in 94, so this time around perhaps such and effort will have
more impact.
As far as I know, VTW is gearing up to do this again, though I haven't
spoken to Shabbir about his plans. If he or anyone else is seriously
considering doing this, I am certainly happy to contribute some time and a
few ideas to the effort.

STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEAHY ON THE
        ADMINISTRATION'S NEW ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE
                                October 1, 1996
        The timing of the Administration's announcement on encryption,
     within hours of the Congress' likely adjournment, is unfortunate.
     The Administration needs to work with Congress to develop a
     consensus on a national encryption policy that takes account of
     the privacy, law enforcement and competitiveness concerns of our
     Nation's citizens and businesses.
        Taking unilateral steps will not resolve this issue, but
     instead could delay building the consensus we so urgently need.
     This issue simply cannot by resolved by Executive fiat.
        While technology should not dictate policy, particularly when
     our public safety and national security interests are at issue,
     any policy we adopt must protect our privacy.  As the
     Administration and industry rush to find an alternative to
     unbreakable encryption, they should take heed that any solution
     which fails to protect the Fourth Amendment and privacy rights of
     our citizens will be unacceptable.
        That is why, with bipartisan support, Senator Burns and I
     introduced legislation in March that set out privacy safeguards
     to protect the decoding keys to encrypted communications and
     stringent legal procedures for law enforcement agencies to get
     access to those keys.
        In this plan, the Administration is directing the resources of
     our high-tech industry to develop breakable, rather than
     unbreakable, encryption. But no one is yet clear about who will
     be legally allowed to break into encrypted messages, and under
     what circumstances. These are questions that have to be answered
     not only with our own government but also with foreign
     governments.  The weakest link in a key recovery system may be
     the country with the weakest privacy protections. Internet users,
     who can send messages around the globe seamlessly, do not want
     the privacy of their encrypted communications to be at the mercy
     of a country that ignores the Fourth Amendment principles we
     enjoy here.
        These are significant privacy and security concerns not
     answered by the Administration's plan.
        Even without reading the fine print, the general outline of
     the Administration's plan smacks of the government trying to
     control the marketplace for high-tech products. Only those
     companies that agree to turn over their business plans to the
     government and show that they are developing key recovery
     systems, will be rewarded with permission to sell abroad products
     with DES encryption, which is the global encryption standard.
        Conditioning foreign sales of products with DES on development
     of key recovery systems puts enormous pressure on our computer
     industry to move forward with key recovery, whether their
     customers want it or not.
         Internet users themselves -- not the FBI, not the NSA, not
     any government regulator -- should decide what encryption method
     best serves their needs. Then the marketplace will be able to
     respond. The Administration is putting the proverbial cart before
     the horse, by putting law enforcement interests ahead of every
     one elses.
        But that is not the only catch in the Administration's plan.
     Permission to export DES will end in two years. Allowing American
     companies to sell DES overseas is a step long overdue. Given the
     fact that a Japanese company is already selling "triple DES", one
     might say this step is too little, too late. Threatening to pull
     the plug on DES in two years, when this genie is already out of
     the bottle, does not promote our high-tech industries overseas.
     Does this mean that U.S. companies selling sophisticated computer
     systems with DES encryption overseas must warn their customers
     that the supply may end in two years? Customers both here and
     abroad want stable suppliers, not those jerked around by their
     government.
        The most effective way to protect the privacy and security of
     our on-line communications is to use encryption technology. Every
     American should be concerned about our country's policy on
     encryption since the resolution of this debate will affect
     privacy, jobs and the competitiveness of our high-tech
     industries.

Tim -
It's too bad we may not see eye-to-eye on this one.
For what it's worth, CDT shares your concerns about the criminal provision
in the SAFE bill.  We believe that as currently written, the provision is
overly broad and could create a chilling effect on the everyday use of
encryption, and  unnecessary because it duplicates existing obstruction of
justice law.
We have expressed these concerns both publicly (in a letter to the
committee signed by EPIC, ACLU, EFF, VTW, CDT, and over 20 other
organizations - see   and
privately in conversations with the committee staff.  We hope to work with
the authors of SAFE to address these concerns, but, as you know, we are not
running this show and have to work with what the Congress gives us.
However, despite our concerns about the criminal provisions, we believe
strongly that the SAFE bill, and the bills in the Senate sponsored by Burns
and Leahy, are vitally important and should be passed.
As you know, the debate over encryption policy reform has been going on for
more than 4 years.  Despite all of our efforts to promote the use of
encryption, crypto is still not widely used by the public.
The Clinton administration has not backed off from their commitment to a
global key-escrow/key-recovery system with guaranteed law enforcement
access to private keys. And despite the brilliant work of EFF on the
various legal challenges to the export restrictions, we feel this issue
will only be fully resolved through legislation.
The status quo, in our view, is not good enough.  Because of the export
controls and the lack of a coherent US encryption policy, Internet users do
not have access to the privacy protecting encryption products they need.
Congress needs to stand up to the Administration and say, with a strong
voice, "your policy is a failure - we need a different solution".  That's
what SAFE, Pro-CODE, and ECPA II do.

This is indeed true - CDT sent a separate letter and signed the IPC letter.
As Marc Rotenberg knows very well, the legislative process is complicated.
Marc also knows that Goodlatte, Coble, Lofgren, and the other subcommittee
supporters of SAFE chose not to consider any amendments at the subcommittee
markup, but rather to take up our concerns at the full committee.
Goodlatte's staff and the other sponsors of SAFE had worked very hard to
prevent any amendments, hostile *and* friendly, at the subcommittee vote
for fear of hostile amendments from the Administration and opponents of
SAFE in the congress. A bill isn't worth much when it gets to the full
Committee if it gets gutted at the Subcommittee.  Goodlatte wanted to get
some momentum behind it before going into the expected all out fight at the
full committee.
CDT sent a separate letter to the subcommittee members focused on the
subcommittee markup urging the them to pass the bill without amendments.
The IPC letter was deliberately left vague with the intent of focusing on
the full Judiciary committee vote later this month.
We also signed the IPC letter to the full committee urging changes to the
criminal provision, and intend to work to see those changes through.

Looks like the FBI and thier allies have been playing hardball, and have
managed to convince a high-ranking Republican member of Congress to buy
into their ani-cryto reform arguments.
Solomon is the Chairman of the House Rules Committee.
This fight just got a lot tougher.
                             May 1, 1997
Dear Colleague:
Earlier this week, after meeting with officials from Defense and FBI, I
removed myself as a cosponsor of HR 695.  Allow me to explain some of their
concerns about this bill.
The Department of Defense believes that HR 695 would increase the export
threshold for encryption software to a level which would effectively remove
existing controls.  This would make unbreakable encryption technology
widely available and "have a negative impact on national security,
effective law enforcement and public safety".  The FBI opposes the bill
because, "It would be irresponsible for the U.S. to adopt a policy that
consciously unleashes widespread, unbreakable, non-key recovery encryption
products that undermine law enforcement in the United States and worldwide."
I also met with Ambassador Aaron (OECD), who pointed out that many of the
major industrial countries have already approved encryption safeguards and
the rest are waiting for the United States to act.  He believes HR 695
would send the worst possible signal to our allies.
Lastly, Assistant Attorney General Andrew Fois stated in a letter to
Chairman Coble, "... the bill would severely compromise law enforcement's
ability to protect the American people from the threats posed by
terrorists, organized crime, child pornographers, drug cartels, financial
predators, hostile foreign intelligence agents, and other criminals... It
is difficult enough to fight crime without making criminals' tasks any
In addition to the FBI and DOD the legislation is opposed by the Justice
Department, Central Intelligence,. the NSA, the National District
Attorney's Association, the International Association of Chiefs of Police
and the National Sherrif's Association.  Again, I would ask you to oppose
HR 695.
                                   Sincerely,
                                   [signed]
                                   Member of Congress.

To stick our heads in the sand now would just make it easier for the FBI to

This battle is FAR from over. It would be a serous mistake to give up now.
PS: Interestingly, Reuters is reporting that the Administraon has "serious
problems" with the Dellums/Weldon Amendment:
Clinton official not backing new encryption plan
    WASHINGTON, Sept 9 (Reuter) - The Clinton administration has serious
problems with a new congressional proposal to tighten export limits on
computer encoding technology even though it prefers the approach to one
contained in earlier legislation, a top official said on Tuesday.
   Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch told Reuters that an
amendment approved by the House National Security Committee earlier on
Tuesday would give the secretary of defense veto power over encryption
export decisions.
   "Giving the secretary of defense a veto is inconsistent with the
president's executive order and inconsistent with the policies of four
prior administrations," Reinsch said. "The administration thinks all
relevent agencies should have a seat at the table and none should have a
   Under current policy, enacted by presidential order last year,
encryption export requests are reviewed by the Departments of State,
Defense, Energy, Commerce and Justice, along with the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency.
   The most powerful encryption products cannot be exported unless they
contain a feature allowing the government to decode any messages covertly.
   The amendment, authored by Rep. Curt Weldon, Republican of Pennsylvania,
 and Rep. Ron Dellums, Democrat of California, would require the president
to set "the maximum level of encryption strength that could be exported
from the United States ... without harm to the national security of the
United States."
   Products at or below the established level could be exported after a
one-time review specified by the secretary of commerce with the concurrence
 of the secretary of defense.
   The proposal virtually gutted the bill to which it was attached. The
original bill, written by Virginia Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte, would
greatly relax export controls.
   Reinsch said the administration supported the "harm to the national
security" standard. "It gives the administration the authority it needs,"
he said. "We'd much rather have this than (the original)."
   Software companies, civil libertarians and Internet user groups all
favor relaxing the current limits and expressed strong concerns about the
Weldon amendment.
   The amendment appeared to outlaw differential treatment currently
accorded to some encryption products used by financial institutions or
subsidiaries of U.S. companies.
   Reinsch said that section of the amendment "could be more artfully
   He also criticized the proposal for not requiring companies to export
products with features allowing for government access to coded messages, an
 approach known as key recovery.
   The current policy "links all of the parts together and uses export
controls as a device to move towards key recovery," he said. "We believe
export controls should include key recovery."

I am not suggesting that we should relax because the Administration is not
completely satisfied with this provision. They scored a hit against SAFE,
just like we won one at the Foreign Relations Committee.  Border skirmishes
in the larger, ongoing war.
None the less, this is much bigger than a quibble over details, IMHO.
There are important policy implications of this language.  And politically,
it is extremely significant that Reinsch would be critical at all,
considering that the Committee voted to substantially undercut the bill
(one of Reinsch's top priorities).  Perhaps you missed this nuance.

@_subject: Re: House National Security committee guts SAFE, worse than nobill 
I agree that things look pretty bleak and that the chances for passing good
crypto legislation are not so good at the moment.  And, for the record, CDT
strenuously opposes the amended SAFE bill, S. 909, and the various
proposals coming from the FBI.  We also do not see a way to reconcile these
proposals, and are not working for a "deal" (sorry Seth).
We plan on opposing these bills by vigorously engaging in the process --
being there at every turn to tell the Congress and the Administration why
they are wrong, why key recovery won't work, and why export relief is
necessary to promote privacy and security on the Net in a way that is
constructive and moves the issue forward.
Lets step back for a moment and look at the bigger picture.
We all agree that the status quo is not good for privacy.  The Bernstein
case was important in proving our rhetorical points (and good for
Bernstein), but it didn't topple the current export policy, which we all
know is crippling the widespread availability of strong, easy-to-use crypto.
The Administration WANTS legislation to impose key recovery and wants
continued export restrictions.  It has passed the Senate Commerce
Committee, it's in the current export policy, and the FBI is likely to get
it approved by the Intelligence committee tomorrow.
If they succeed and mandatory key recovery becomes law, there will
certainly be court challenges (and CDT would join that fight), but it won't
be as clear cut as the CDA case was, and it's doubtful we would have the
strength (and the resources) of as broad a coalition of plaintiffs.  We may
be right, but that doesn't guarantee victory.
Eventually, if we want to achieve anything, we will need to change the
current policy.  We do not believe that can be accomplished by simply by
being 'obstructionists'.  We do believe that it can be accomplished by
engaging in the process, letting Congress and the Administration know that
we care about this issue, and are willing to fight for what we believe. We
are not ready to give up just because we took a hit in the National
Security Committee.
Hope that helps clarify.

A little more news:
I've been told that the Bell companies have issued a statement saying that
they remain opposed to Oxley II despite Oxley's attempts to bring them on
board.  This is good news -- the bell companies hold a lot of sway on the
Commerce Committee and their opposition is politically valuable to us.
I'd be surprised if the version of Oxley II posted on our site is
inaccurate (it's dated 12:14 pm yesterday), but it is possible that there
is an Oxley III floating around somewhere.   Perhaps they are just trying
to throw you off the scent.
Solomon's statement that only SAFE w/Oxley will go to the floor is also
good news -- it means that chances of anything passing this session are
that much lower.

@_subject: In response to Declan's questions about crypto.com 
This morning, a private note from me to Declan -- part of an ongoing
personal conversation between Declan, CDT, and his editors at Time -- was
forwarded to several public lists.
It was not, as some have assumed, an attempt to obscure the substantive
issues he raised.  Unfortunately, this whole thing explored before CDT had
a chance to respond to Declan's questions directly.
I hope that the points below will help to clarify the issues:
1. CDT, along with VTW, EFF, ATR and Wired, spent the last two weeks rallying
   Internet users to call the Committee in opposition to Oxley-Manton.  We
   generated thousands of phone calls from constituents to the Committee, which
   we believe was a decisive factor in the defeat of Oxley-Manton.
2. CDT rallied support among the computer and communications industries,
   including many companies that have not yet weighed in yet on this issue.
   Opposition from the baby bells, along with companies who have in the past
   been favorable to the Administration's position (like IBM and TIS), probably
   made the difference in defeating Oxley-Manton
3. CDT did NOT support, nor work on, the White-Markey proposal. We strongly
   oppose the increased criminal provisions (as well as the criminal provisions
   in the original SAFE bill).  We are also concerned about the role of the
   Center and the proposed liability limitations for key recovery agents
   we do not believe that any liability limitations were included in the final
   bill)
4. CDT continues to support efforts to relax encryption export controls.  We
   believe that export relief is critical to promoting privacy and security on
   the Internet, both at home and abroad. We are steadfastly opposed to ANY
   domestic requirements, mandatory or "voluntary", to incorporate key-escrow,
   key-recovery, or other "immediate access" requirements.
5. We expect that all efforts to enact encryption reform legislation are
   for the remainder of this year, and we do not support any effort to bring
   SAFE to the House floor.  All our efforts are focused on stopping Congress
   from passing any bill in the foreseeable future, unless and until it is
   that domestic  law enforcement access requirements will NOT be a part of any
   legislation.
6. We are not working for a "compromise" with the FBI or any other
supporters of
   domestic encryption controls.
We also recognize the realities of politics.  No matter how much any of us
might wish it to be true, members of the Commerce Committee were not
willing to stand up and simply oppose everything.   It was not in the
cards.  White and Markey offered them a chance to defeat Oxley while
throwing a small bone to law enforcement.  We believe that passage of SAFE
with the White-Markey amendment, despite the problems with the criminal
provisions, is on balance, a step forward in the fight for encryption
policy reform.
That's why we have described the vote on cryto.com as a "vote in favor of
privacy".  I do not expect that this will convince all of our detractors,
but I do hope this clarifies the substance of Declan's criticism.
As always, I am happy to respond to queries about CDT's positions and
tactics, but I am not interested in engaging in public flame throwing.
