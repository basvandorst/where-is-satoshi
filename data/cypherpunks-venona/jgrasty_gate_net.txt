Alex sez:
Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) has an optional command called APOP which sends a string of the form "".
The POP3 client calculates the MD5 digest of   password
and sends it to the server as "APOP username 58349485whatever89583449".
I like it.

@_subject: Questions about SMTP and NNTP 
While working on the SMTP and NNTP clients for the WinSock remailer,
I have uncovered two questions I don't know the answer to.  Here they
1.  When sending a message to the SMTP server, I use scenario 4 as
    shown in RFC821 as a basis for my client.  There seems to be a     huge security hole in SMTP.  I can use just about any name     when sending the VRFY command.  For example, I could connect to
    "sensemedia.com" and pretend to be "tcmay".  Is there something
    I'm missing here or is there really that big a security hole in
    SMTP?
2.  How do you do user authentication in NNTP?  There's nothing about
    it RFC977.  Is there a later RFC that describes how to do user
    authentication?  All of my newsreaders support this function, but
    I haven't been able to figure out how to do it.
Any help you can give me would be appreciated.
ObWinSock Remailer:  I have the POP3, NNTP and SMTP clients functional
now.  With luck, I'll have an alpha test version of the remailer in two or three weeks.
ObCypherPunks:  Is the list down?  I haven't heard a peep since about
noon.  I send a "who cypherpunks" to majordomo and received a quick reply which shows I'm still subscribed.  Any idea?

@_subject: Exportable if Escrowed Changes Nothing! 
This "change" that encryption software can be exported if the keys are
escrowed means nothing.  PGP still couldn't be exported, since it can
generate its own keys.  You can be sure that any program that generates
its own keys couldn't be exported.  How are you going to escrow 2^100
possible keys (or whatever it is that PGP can generate)?
Thus, this regulatory change means diddly-squat.  The only crypto that could be exported would be something like Clipper, and they already said
that could be exported.
Governments:  can't live with 'em, can't shoot 'em.

You grossly misinterpreted my remark.  I believe that socialist-statism
exhibited by the current US gov't is about to crack due to overspending
and technology.  Whether it will go peacefully or not is another question.
I stand ready to defend myself if necessary, but I prefer to kick the
statists in the ass by deploying strong encryption.  When information
can flow, the statists lose.  They know that; witness the frantic effort
to outlaw encryption.  Too late, though.
I'm writing code to hasten the end of the statists.  Just what are you doing besides hiding behind anonymity?

I'm pleased to announce that the WinSock Remailer is going
into operation tonight at 11:00 PM.
Please feel free to test it.  You can get the key by sending
a message to winsock with the "Subject: remailer-key".
After about a week of further testing, I will be releasing the
executables to everyone who sent me a note asking to participate in the alpha test.  If you want to be included, please send me a note.
Here's the info for the remailer-list:
$remailer{"winsock"} = " cpunk pgp hash cut ksub reord";
I'll be adding "post" to this list after I get a more thorough testing of the NNTP code that I added for authentication.  "latent"
is also pending.
The remailer will run every 60 seconds from 12:00 AM to 8:00 AM
every day and whenever I am online.  c2.org automatically spools
the messages when I am not connected.
Note:  alt.religion.scientology and alt.clearing.technology are
blocked.  I'm not interested in run-ins with either supporters
or detractors of the Church of Scientology.  Binary and picture
groups are also blocked, but only because I don't have the bandwidth to support them.
Anyone who has blocking lists that they want to share, please
send them to me.

I received the following fan mail today, in regards to my announcement of the WinSock Remailer.  In my announcement, I noted that I have blocked the Church of Scientology discussion groups alt.religion.scientology and alt.clearing.technology.  The author shall remain anonymous:
Anyone who has checked my webpage (
knows that the blocking lists are entirely up to the user.
Let me state clearly that I'm just not interested in the Church
of Scientology, its supporters or detractors.  My interest is
in writing remailers and seeing that the remailers are widely
distributed.  If I involve myself in this COS mess, then I'm
distracting myself from my mission, which is writing remailers.
Fighting "wars" is for the young and strong.  Think of me as
a weapons designer.  I build the weapons, someone else fights the wars.  Freedom needs weapons designers and warriors.
That is my version of "Cypherpunk Patriotism".
I offered my detractor a copy of the remailer so that he can
run his own remailer and fight his war with COS.  Let's see if
he puts up or shuts up.  My guess is the latter.

@_subject: Re: remailer network/winsock remailers 
Actually, the way the WinSock Remailer works is that the user's ISP spools
the mail and the remailer fetches it from the mail spool via the POP3
protocol.  Thus, as long as the mail spool does not overflow, messages
will not be lost.
As I develop the remailer, one of the features I'm adding is the ability
of the remailer to fetch only the messages with valid remail headers and
leave the remaining messages in the mail spool.  In this way, the mail spool is shared between the user and the remailer.  The only disadvantage is that all of the improperly formatted messages end up
in the user's mailbox.  An annoyance.
Another feature I'm adding is the ability to remail outgoing messages
through another remailer to hide the origin of the message.  This is to
hide the presence of the remailer or to provide a discardable account that
takes all the heat for spams, harrassment, etc.  Thus, a limited stealth capability is achieved.  A third feature is to accept inputs from a message pool, say alt.anonymous.messages, and remail them through another
remailer.  These are both attempts to increase the number of available
remailers and to develop some way to make remailers more resistant to
governments and other speedbumps on the internet.

The first alpha release of the WinSock Remailer is now available via
e-mail.  Due to problems setting up user authentication on my homepage
  I have decided to distribute it via e-mail until I can get user authentication working.
In order for you to receive the WinSock Remailer, I have to be reasonably sure that you are a US or Canadian citizen or permanent resident.  Therefore, you will need to review a copy of the License Agreement and fill out the required information.  Then clear-sign the agreement with PGP and mail it to me at jgrasty  Don't forget to tell me where I can
find your PGP public key so that I can check the signature.  No signed
license agreement, no remailer.
In order for me to have a good feeling that you are not a foreign national,
I need to have the following information check out:
a.  Verify that your address is within the boundaries of the US or Canada.
    I will do this by checking if you are in a public address database such
    as "88 Million Households Phone Book".
b.  Verify that your name and e-mail address is the same as in your public     key.

Due to the large number of inconsiderate users and spammers,

operation of the WinSock Remailer at winsock to accept
only incoming messages that are encrypted with PGP.  This change will become effective September 16, 1996 at 9:00 PM EDT.
On a brighter note, a new release of the WinSock Remailer will
be available on September 17.  In addition to bug fixes, a number of new features have been added including:
- support for shared or exclusive POP account (the operator
  will be able to operate the remailer from his personal   account; messages without proper remail headers will be
  left in the mail spool for retrieval with any other POP
  mail client).
- support for changing the outgoing message pool size on the
  Outgoing Mail dialog box.
- remailer now accepts "help" in addition to "remailer-help"
  to retrieve the help file for the remailer.  A large   number of help requests were piling up in the reject
  directory, so this should cure that problem.
And yes, the bug that prevented the remailer from operating
in PGP Only mode, has been fixed.  :-)
