@_subject: Euro Key Escrow 
Someone, somewhere, posted a rumour that Europe was about to go for a key
escrow scheme known as "Royal Holloway".
I have done a little research and gleaned the following:
It is, apparently, true that the EC is considering schemes for key escrow, by
"trusted third parties" (trusted by who, I'd like to know?). "Royal Holloway"
is one of these schemes. It is named after the college of origin, if anyone
cares. It essentially revolves around each pair of TTPs sharing two out of
three parts of a key, and generating the third part for each of their users.
The idea is that either of the TTPs who generated keys for an encrypted
message exchange can decode it (by using the private key of their "client" and
the public key of the other TTP's "client").
Full details can be found at:
This is in PostScript. I'm not aware of any plain text versions.
I'm informed that this is likely to be introduced into EC legislation, though
my understanding is that members are not required to actually incorporate the
legislation. No doubt France will embrace it with happy shouts.
Of course, it is our duty as netizens to resist this kind of rubbish, and I
encourage you to write to your MP/EuroMP (or local equivalent).

I did a port of PGP to a Windows DLL a long time back, but I never got around
to releasing it. I could bring it up to date and put it out there if there is
popular demand.

I think claiming RPN for Forth is pushing it a little far. Admittedly it is
stack-based (well, two-stack-based), and everything an operator can operate on
is to the left, but the provision of arbitrary stack manipulation, "compile"
mode (triggered by the '[' operator, if my memory serves) and so on make it
rather a different beast.
Incidentally, PostScript is Forth in disguise.

@_subject: More Euro Key Escrow 
I've looked more closely at the "Royal Holloway" protocol, supposedly
under consideration by the EC for key escrow in Europe, though I must say that
anyone who deploys it will get what they deserve.
I have discovered some further weaknesses in the protocol, documented
Comments are welcome.

It seems appropriate to quote Schneier on the subject:
"Those who claim to have an unbreakable cipher simply because they can't break
it are either geniuses or fools. Unfortunately, there are more of the latter in
the world."
"Believe it or not, there is a perfect encryption system. It's called a
one-time pad..."

Note that Schneier says "perfect", not "unbreakable".

Actually, its my proprietary version of Apache, rebadged and with some extras.
My version is free. I'm pleased to hear it is "well regarded", though ;-)

Really? Who reviewed the security of SafePassage?
I've never seen a security review of SSLeay, and if anyone gave it a clean bill
of health, they didn't have their eye on the ball. Note, I'm not knocking
SSLeay here, it is a wonderful lump of code, but it hasn't been written with
security in mind (IMHO).

I think I would discuss this with the author before going public, to give
him the usual opportunity to clean up before all hell breaks loose. However,
that is what I'd call "work" rather than "fun", so I'd want paying for it.
No doubt I'll take it up with Eric at some point, when neither of us has
anything better to do.
My impression is that Eric is more interested in speed and functionality than
strict security (and considering the incredible vulnerability that is more or
less inherent in an SSL implementation, I feel the same). I could be wrong, of
I will say that I'm not aware of any problems that a good firewall and physical
security don't take care of. That isn't to say there aren't any - I haven't
looked that hard.

SSL requires the keying material to be available at all times. This is rather
different from many applications of cryptography, where one can keep keying
material safely locked away except when it is needed.
This is the inherent vulnerability.

I know that personal attacks are the currency on this list, but I may as well
point out that it is precisely because I do know what I'm talking about that I
can reasonably expect to be paid to do the talking.

@_subject: SSLeay security 
It seems I have expressed myself poorly. My point was that, as far as I am
aware, SSLeay has not been widely reviewed. A lot of people use it, sure, but
that is not review.
Since there are obvious defects in the code, from a security point of view,
such as failure to scrub keys, it wouldn't get a clean bill of health from me.
Of course, these kinds of defects require other defects in the user's security
policy (such as running on an operating system which permits free access to
memory) to exploit.
There may or may not be worse problems. I don't know. And I won't know until
either it becomes important to me, someone pays me to find out, or someone else
points them out.
I'm not saying that I'm aware of defects which are not obvious but my
experience in using it suggests that it may have them - it isn't that hard to
crash, and where there are crashes lurk possible security holes. Tracking
these down is where it stops being fun. At least for me.
