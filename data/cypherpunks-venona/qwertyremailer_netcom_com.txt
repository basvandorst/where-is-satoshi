@_subject: Remailer FAQ. Info request! 
I have only seen unsatisfying info on the remailers out there. If people
know the details up front, the Cypherpunk remailers will become more popular.
Different people have different needs for remailing as well.
Please help me out with this. I would appreciate info from operators as
well as users of remailers. If you do not want to disclose a specific
bit of info, I will enter it as "N/A". If I get no answer at all I will
leave it as "?". Send responses to qwerty If you wish your
remailer be taken off the list I will comply.

Out of personal curiousity concerning the claims of how trivial
"traffic analysis" of the qwerty or catalyst remailers on Netcom
would be for "anyone" to carry out, I offer $20 to the first
person to reveal from which SITE this message originated from.
Please do not announce my name or login ID. Just the site. I am
logged into a friend's account and I am remailing this with no
encryption just through qwerty It is now 5:41 PM EST.
You do not have to reveal your methods to receive the award, which
I will mail to you. Happy hacking you WIMPS.
If you wish to remain anonymous, mail the answer to qwerty
and my lips are sealed except for announcing success.

This is exactly the point I was trying to make. I wanted the
word "trivial" to be clarified by those who were being so vocal
about dismissing a remailer on Netcom.
You'll also need a good lawyer when Netcom finds your tap ;-).
But I'm sure some skilled hacker will be able to tell me the site and
I'll happily be out $20, in say, a couple days? No use hacking my
password, as I keep no logs (for now). The reason it's only $20, is
that I am indeed honestly interested in knowing something about my
remailer's security, and I don't know enough internet/Unix to risk
being a total sucker.

Perry wrote,
"However, make no mistake that Netcom can and will cooperate with the

like, so it seems that the security afforded isn't that good."
So you aren't interested unless you can commit serious felony crimes
using a given remailer? I would be happy if criminals stayed away from
my remailer. What do you mean by "security"? And if the police find out
a personally owned machine was involved, I couldn't imagine them not
just swooping in at midnight and taking it away at gunpoint. I hope
those privately owned machines don't have logs ;-). In my mind, the whole
secret to gaining privacy is not attracting attention in the first place.
Using a remailer DOES allow a person to communicate anonymously with
someone else, in two directions. If a party has enough power to tap
Netcom, then sendmail logs or no sendmail logs, they will find you.
"Besides, $20 is a paltry sum for the amount of work involved."
Think of it as a trophy, which I'm sure most understood. I'm not offering
you a job.
I appreciate your view though, and since I've posted a request for
remailer comments, might you help us all and send me some comments about
the various remailers and what types of security each affords? If some
wish to use remailers for serious underground activity, which should they
use or not use? If they just want to keep bounced mail from telling their
system postmaster who they're talking to, then that's a different type
of security need.

@_subject: Re: New remailer up. 
Sure, a vanilla user at netcom probably can't track the remailer logs,
unless of course there are BUGS in SENDMAIL (gasp!) or SunOS or whatever.
But remailers aren't just to keep random users from knowing who you are
so you can post better anonymous letters to alt.sex.anonymous.
At least some of us would like real privacy, and consider remailers
a useful part of this, and this means that if you're using remailers
to communicate with your sources for the newspaper article you're writing
on the CIA's cocaine delivery shortfalls or the NSA/Trilateralist designs for
the National Health Care ID Card or your mayor's child pornography habits,
that nobody can track you or your sources down easily.
That means that root can't do it using the root password,
even if they want to comply with the subpoena, and the Secret Service
can't do it after confiscating netcom's machines or wiretapping their phones.
Non-encrypting remailers can never really get that good, but they can
at least d part of the job, and encrypting remailer networks may get
that good if there's enough traffic through the system.
So meanwhile, are you giving root permission to try to
identify the source of your mail and win the $20 for finding out
whether you're really Xenon or you're really L.D.'s evil twin Skippy?
(No idea if they'll try, or if they're even listening....)

I have no answer to that. I don't know what "permission" means in this
context. I never discluded Netcom employees though. I doubt they would
wish to appear to have lax security by posting the answer though.
Does L.D. have an evil twin? I hope he doesn't get a Unix account.
Seriously, your comments were the first I've seen that really explain to
me what sort of security problem a Netcom remailer faces. Now then, I
ask you as well, might you fill in a few of the blanks in the remailer

@_subject: anonymous mail bombers and what to do about them 
Don't feed the animals.
Generally, when one person is mail-bombing another, either there has been a fair amount of provocation by at least one of the parties,
and escalation of childishness isn't as useful as trying to
resolve some of your differences, though it can offer a certain amount
of basic 4-year-old ego satisfaction.  If somebody's mail-bombing you, and they're root, and they're not doing
it anonymously, you don't need to either; the worst revealing your identity will do at that point is encourage them to mail-bomb you.
And your system administrator probably already knows who you are by now,
assuming the bombing has been at a high rate.
If the bomber is root on his home machine, and the bombs include
bad words that aren't mere reflections of your words to him,
you could always complain to the phone company that you're receiving
obscene phone calls.  I doubt the policies or laws about that
specify whether the calls have to be made in spoken English....
If the bomber is root on his business machine, you can complain to
his management, assuming you can locate them.  Some managers get
very bent out of shape about this and do random clueless things,
others conservatively protect their company images,
others ask what state and federal laws have been broken and
tell you to stifle yourself if the answer is "none".
If the bomber is root on his home PC at a university,
arbitrary randomness can occur.
On the other hand, if you're really L- D-, and the person who is
mailbombing you is Perry Metzger, expending large amounts of
childishness in his direction will not accomplish anything positive
for either of you, and if both of you start sending N copies of
each others' mail to each other, exponential growth will not
help either of your systems.  If you're not really L- D-, but
the person who is mailbombing you is still Perry, try talking
rationally to him; he can do that just fine if he thinks it's worthwhile.
If you're really L- D-, and the person is or is not Perry, we can help.
Post your full name, home address with precise latitude  and longitude,
and we'll be happy to deliver some advanced plutonium products you may find useful in resolving your problems.

@_subject: Re: New remailer up 
I haven't really kept track of which remailers are how reliable;
they're almost all relatively new and experimental,
people are hacking software, they go up and down a lot,
and I almost never use them anyway.  I also don't like
keeping track of the syntax and which ::'s are followed by which  :-)
Julf's anon.penet.fi remailer is serious; he's done a lot of work
to get a private machine, payng for a reasonably expensive
64kbps line himself, and has it located somewhere that only 3 people know.
(The original was located at a university, and somebody decided
they wanted it Closed.)  It's also outside the US, which is useful,
.  On the other hand, it works differently than the one-way anonymous remailers,
uses up a substantial fraction of the net.bandwidth into FInland,
and costs him real bucks - somebody ought to start a US equivalent
and deload him.
I'd guess tht extropia is also probably well-run, or at least has good features.  But I haven't used it.

@_subject: Re: New remailer up. 
Rather than try to run in some asynchronous mode as you suggest, why
not do the following when each message arrives:
   place message in your queue, designating random hold time
   foreach message in the queue that's been held long enough
         send random number (1<=n<=3) dummy messages
         send the queued message
         send random number (1<=n<=5) dummy messages
The whole thing remains data-driven while you're not logged in
and can be manually flushed if you are logged in.  So long as
there is a steady stream of traffic, messages won't get stalled
for long times.  You could even send some 'activation' messages
at controlled intervals from some comfortable site (where you can
use cron), routed via another remailer.
Just some ideas off the top of my head.

Nobody asks:
I'm not sure what the ITAR rules say about export of armaments by
the military; it would be nice if it were illegal :-)
Also don't know if sending to American military bases overseas
counts as export, especially if it involves going through
non-US territory (if there is such a thing any more :-()
Use of encryption technology by the military is probably subject to
all sorts of rules; use for official purposes certainly is.
You could probably get in major trouble for doing so without authorization,
and I doubt PGP is officially approved; it's certainly not approved
for classified information.
Patent issues are also involved; the government is allowed to use
RSA as part of the terms of the funding deals for their research,
but this presumably doesn't apply to private use by government
employees.  On the other hand, IDEA wasn't developed with US funds,
and its patent probably doesn't give the government any rights to use it.  Ascom Tech probably could try to restrict it if they wanted.

Phil Zimmerman and a few others do, and hopefully they will also give PGP a

don't code. I make molecules, and soon I will be using standing waves made
by lasers to deposit atoms on surfaces, working at Harvard, Bell Labs, and
NIST to help develop the next next generation of CPUs, sensors and other
devices. If you want something to write code for, 10 years from now, don't
disrespect those who do sciences other than programming.
Your answer is what the government WANTS the programmers to be like, like this:
"You want bulk vitamin C powder which has been rumored to cure that new
AIDS strain that started spreading by air? Well that wouldn't make me or
anyone else any cash, and since the FDA has banned vitamin supplements,
you better go pick up a book on synthesis. I think you start with glucose.
Oh, and include organometallics, since it's only  certain mixed oxidation
state Copper complex dimers that seems to work. Fairly complex stuff. Hurry
up though, I hear that AIDS (Clipper) virus kicks in pretty fast! But don't
expect chemists to give you any, well since you see, that would be altruistic
and that is not logical, since my value system is selfishness. As long as I
can cure myself, and you aren't paying me large sums, well, bye bye."
And making PGP better and posting it anonymously or not, is no where as illegal
as if I were to offer an unapproved medicinal to patients in need, something
that would immediately put me in handcuffs. Happily, drugs that are truly
effective become available to terminal patients, since of course that makes
money. I'm going into crystal and surface chemistry anyway, and the FDA
seems to be failing in its ongoing attempts to take away my legal vitamin C
powder. I fear though that they may succeed in 10 years, and the Clipper's
going to send my e-mail into the FDA's "bad guy" files, as being a person who
takes more vitamin C than can be found in a can of Coca Cola. I just want
privacy and to be left alone. And research funds ;-).

So what's your point? Talk is cheap. The situation remains the same.
The message in my post remains valid. The reason why it is so doesn't matter
to someone desiring privacy. The internet still sucks and always will, due
to the From and Received by e-mail headers as well as many other Unix system
problems like sendmail logs, and the fact that you can't trust a wire 'cause

There should be a new version of PGP Tools and Magic Money on csn.org soon.
The PGP Tools will be called pgptl10b.zip and the Magic Money will be
mgmny10b.zip. The new naming was warlord's idea: the "b" will be "c" etc
in future releases, until some serious updating justifies a new version.
The new Magic Money does not contain the PGP Tools files, so be sure to
download PGP Tools as well. Will I run out of bugs or letters first? :-)
The prime-multiplication problem appears to have gone away. The new Magic
Money checks the whole coin, but the attack is probably impossible anyway.
jkreznar quotes:
   Here we consider only {\em prime\/} divisors of $n$ and ask, for
   given order of magnitude of $n$. ``how many prime divisors are
   there typically?'' and ``how many {\em different\/} ones are
   there?''  Some of the answers will be rather counterintuitive.
   Thus, a 50-digit number ($10^{21}$ times the age of our universe
   measured in picoseconds) has only about 5 different prime
   factors on average and --- even more surprisingly --- 50-digit
   numbers have typically fewer than 6 prime factors in all, even
   counting repeated occurrences of the same prime factor as
   separate factors.
   We will also learn something about the distribution of the
   number of prime factors and its implications for the important
   factoring problem.  Thus, we discover that even for numbers as
   large as $10^{50}$, the two smallest primes, 2 and 3, account
   for about 25\% of all prime factors!
A number of several hundred digits, such as a Magic Money coin, if it were
to be made of all small primes, would need 50 or 100 factors. These would
probably be very rare, considering this average.
[ describes how finding smooth numbers is equivalent to factoring ]
Unless something else comes up, it looks like we don't need to worry about
this one. If it does become a problem, it would be easy to go to full Chaum cash - take the MD5 of a random number and use it, including the random number in the coin. But there is no reason to code this unless we find out we need it.
This was the last version, which set all precision to max. The last version
also had a bug in pgp_extract_rsa, again involving set_precision. The new one has defines which try to use lower precision and adjust pointers, for those functions which can be sped up this way. If that fails, another define will go back to setting everything max. Please test this on a big-endian machine and find out if it works without everything set to max. If it doesn't, please try to debug it and post what needs to be done.
The code seems to be getting close to working. Does anyone want to set up
a Magic Money server? You could run it through a remailer, if you want to.
The server filters PGP messages from stdin to stdout, so you would not
need root access to run one. It would probably be no harder than running a remailer. I compiled in the 8086.asm under DOS, and it is fast enough.
Use the assembly for whatever system you are running on, because the server
has to perform a lot of secret key operations: decrypt, sign message, and
sign each coin.

@_subject: Magic money not working bigendian 
I have not been able to get Magic Money to work right in big-endian
mode using pgptl10c.zip and mgmny10d.zip.  It does not work
with either -DHIGHFIRST or -DHIGHFIRST plus -DHIGH_KLUDGE.
The key generation seems to go OK, but then when I "mint" a coins.dat
file with 6 coins in the server and try reading it in the client, all
coins after the first are said to have bad signature.
I have tried it with both 512 and 1024 bit keys and both fail.
The previous version of magicmny.zip worked OK.

@_subject: More on magic money problem 
It appears that the problem with bigendian magic money is specific
to the "mint" function.  Minting one coin works OK, but minting more
than one causes every coin after the first to be rejected by the client.
Creating a coins.dat file with the -p function of the client works OK,
even with more than one coin.  Sending the output.asc to the server works
OK too, as does handling the ascii file that comes back from the server.
Only minting fails.
Here are hex dumps of two coins.dat files.  The first one is OK.  It was
created by "c -p" and has two coins.  Key size is 512.

Here is a similar coins.dat file created by "s m" and also holding two

It is immediately obvious that the 2nd, bad, file has a block of 7
zeros where the other one has random data (on the line labeled
000140).  If I am interpreting this file right, this block of 0's is
towards the end of what should be a 16 byte block of random numbers.
So it looks like something overwrote 7 bytes of this 16 byte block
before it could be stored.
Hope this helps.
BTW, for the curious, the format of the coins.dat file is as follows.
For each coin, there is first a c0.  Then there are 16 random bytes,
the "coin ID".  Then there is a PGP-style multi-precision integer
which is the exponent corresponding to the coin.  In this case it is
0011 01000d.  The first two bytes are the number of bits in the MPI,
(11 hex equals 17 decimal) and then there are as many bytes as are
implied by that many bits; these hold the value.  This exponent MPI is
followed by another MPI which holds the bank's signature.  This
can be expressed as (C.ID)^(1/e), where e is the exponent, and C.ID is
a byte of 0, a byte of 1, padding bytes of ff, the magic 18-byte "ASN"
string, then 16 bytes of the coin ID.
In the examples above, the first coin ends exactly in the middle of
the row labelled 000120.  Try to see if you can pick out the
sub-fields of each coin in the files.

There was an error in the earlier message describing format of the magic
money coins.dat files.  The C.ID field (my name for it) has as its low
16 bytes not the coin ID, but rather the MD5 hash of the coin ID.  This
is supposed to make it harder to create fake money, according to the earlier
discussion on cypherpunks list.

pc is being freed but then used four lines later.  This is why the

fix is to move the free to after the fifo_aput.

It does work like the postal service.  You don't have to put a return

like the postal service, it will get postmarked where you mail it from,

Much better flame. Thanks for making me laugh :-) .
I do start to understand your outlook, but I also understand
people like Larry and that makes me quite apprehensive about
quick fixes. What do you think about moderated remailers? If
the code was set up so I never SEE the addresses involved,
only the contents, it would have about the same security as
current remailers, as far as having to trust the operator.
It would put an abrupt end to Detweiler abuses, and solve
Usenet abuses, but not solve "encrypted death threats".
But I don't think even Larry will be sending those to people.
"Making his life easy", or making it harder, just doesn't register
in my mind as being a real issue. Seems to me he would ENJOY
it being harder, for that means we are all paying great attention
to him, and he can upset us SO much more by abusing the remailers
to spoil our quick fix.
