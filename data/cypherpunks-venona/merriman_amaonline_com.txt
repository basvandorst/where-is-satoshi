Krazy glue _will_ glue fingers, if applied properly. I proved this to a
fellow sailor in 1976 by gluing his thumb and forefinger around a JP-5 vent
pipe aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise. Some folks might want to try liquid latex, contact adhesive, silicon sealers
(RTV), or similar products. Soft, flexible, relatively convenient when
applied, and can be 'layered' to the desired thickness. Liquid latex can
usually be found in hobby/craft stores.

Hmmmm. Got a call this morning from a Mike Hughes of the Amarillo PD (APD). Seems they've received "several" complaints about the anti-CDA image on my home page ( Supposedly, it's not the nudity they complainer(s) is(are) all riled up about: it's the age of the models that's being questioned.
Hardcopy of said image has been forwarded to the FBI for 'review'.
Officer (sorry, don't recall his rank) Hughes says *he* thinks the models could conceivably be 18; a judge they showed it to said _she_ thought (personal opinion) younger. Hence, the forwarding to FBI for quasi-official determination.
Officer Hughes going to stop by so I can show him:
        A - that the page is PICS rated
        B - the original of the image :-)
        C - the precautions that PWS takes to warn folks about possibly offensive content.
I don't plan to change the image, so if anyone can point me in the general direction of some Legal Assistance (tm), I'd appreciate it.

One might wonder how Dorothy's opinions about privacy et al would change were it *her* communications/privacy/person at risk (be it through torture, GAK, etc.).
Were a government - duly elected - to come into power similar to that in 30's Germany or 70's Viet Nam, so that intellectuals or the educated became the targets of oppression, would she be as adamant about the perceived "rights" of Government to intrude in her private life, monitor her communications, and so on?

Considering the relative strengths/hardnesses of the metals involved (high-grade steel for barrel, lead and/or copper for projectile), I'd suspect that it would take more than 200-300 rounds to have any significant impact on the barrel rifling. This, of course, is for 'normal' weapons and ammo; using diamond projectiles in a saturday night special voids all warranties, express or implied :-)

PS - Been using Pronto Secure beta software the last couple of days for email. It's not Eudora, but *very* convenient for signing/encrypting. A couple of bugs/gotchas, but nothing I'd expect to see in for-sale version.
I'm actually mildly impressed with how smoothly and transparently it works with PGP on a DOS/Win95 system.

My MSIE3.0b2 does cookies - tho' I've told it to ask me if it's OK first I've even got a specific _sub-directory_ for cookies under my Windows dir. I just wish I could automate the refuse-it-if-it-doesn't-expire "policy" I'm running under.

@_subject: Re: Cookies on Microsoft Explorer? 
I have IE3 configured to ask me for permission to accept a cookie. Yes, some sites send (n!)+1 cookies during a session. If they send too many, I personally move on to another site, after sending them email (!).
Sorry for the confusion - the refuse-it policy I mentioned is a personal policy; there's no option (yet) to configure something like that in IE3. The only two things I've personally seen have been cookies with specific expiration dates (which I usually accept, if the date is reasonable [IMHO]), and cookies that don't display an expiration (which I refuse out-of-hand). It seems to be a compromise that suits _me_; YMMV.
I can 'automate' to the extent of automatically accepting all cookies; yes, by not accepting every cookie, I'm obliged to make a decision for each request. One of the 'benefits' of being somewhate security-aware :-)

Whatever the conditions/causes for the cookiefest, I make it known to them that the volume of cookies gives me electronic diabetes, and move on.

I can testify to the integration and effectiveness of Pronto Secure (Windows version), which I've changed over to from Eudora Pro. As near as I can tell, PGP interface is seamless. Don't know if that's what you're looking for.

Don't know that I'm a 'bomb expert', but it would appear reasonable that 6 just-under-a-pound bombs would do approximately as much damage as a similarly sized larger device.
Even if the 6 devices got scattered to two or more aircraft, the terror factor would be significant

@_subject: 1024-bit keys 
In the documentation for Web Commander (page 7-50, item 19, top of page), under the process for getting a digital ID from VeriSign, you state:
"Also, please note that you cannot send keys longer than 512 to servers outside the United States."
I would like to ask for clarification on this point. Is this meant to say that a server inside the United States is not allowed to use a 512+ bit key with a client outside the U.S., or that a Web Commander server outside the U.S. may not employ a key of greater than 512 bits? In either case, what is the justification for such a statement/restriction? If a Federal regulation, could you please cite the Title and Section?
Thank you.

Absent any ability to cite a chapter-and-verse for making such a statement, and considering the vagueness of it, I would suggest that it either be clarified, justified, or removed.
I would think that, in it's present form, that statement leaves Luckman in no small amount of jeopardy: if true, but misunderstood because of lack of reference, anyone violating it may seek redress against Luckman in the event of prosecution by some law enforcement agency. If untrue, Luckman could be considered equally liable for any real or perceived lost income because of an erroneous limitation, when it's incorrectness is discovered.

Just got off of MS IE3 download page. To retrieve the 128-bit version, they've got a perl script asking for a remote address and a host address via a pair of cookies. Unfortunately, it chokes *every single time* it's invoked on my system, and shows me a 1-800 number (terminally busy) to Has anyone either managed to download it, or gotten through to the 1-800 number? I'd _really_ like a copy of the 128-bit version. I'm a U.S. citizen, live here in Amarillo, TX.
Anyone from MicroSloth reading this *might* want to let a Responsible Person know about the perl script hiccups....

I *finally* managed to get through to the 1-800 number that pops up when an attempted download of 128-bit MSIE 3.0 fails. They can only send out 128-bit version *2.0*, it seems. They referred me to the 1-800 Sales number, but of course, the sales droids weren't savvy enough to understand the problem, and tried to hand me off to a 206 area code number. At that point, I called off the drill - I'm not going to pay for a toll call to fix MS's screwup.
"original" 800 number: 1-800-455-2959
Alternate 800 number: 1-800-426-9400 (autobot) - select 3, then 4, then 1 to get a Real Person.
Anyone else upset about being denied might want to give them a call, too. Who knows, maybe if they get enough calls, they'll send someone to fix it.

Sorry to disturb everyone, but I've got a questions that is (gasp!) immediately related to crypto:
Does anyone have any info on the encryption used in the Paradox (4.5 for Win) database?
