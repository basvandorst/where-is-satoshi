@_subject: Cyphering on the NeXT 
I've got a NeXTstation colour and am dabbling with the various tools that are  available for electronic encryption.  As you may know, NeXT developed a Fast  Elliptical Encryption system (FEE) based on public key technology, but was  prohibited from exporting it due to US law; so the dropped the tool from  their NeXTmail system which was set for International distribution.
I have however found PGP recently (but can not get it to compile; I'm no  programmer so I'm just bumbling throug the code fixing what I can by trial  and error, not wise, I know), and a few other tools (kerberos)...
I'd be interested in hearing from anyone else who is using any form of  encryption on their NeXTs for electronic mail, how they implemented it, what  they see as alternatives and so on.

@_subject: PGP question 
I'm sure this isn't the right place for this question, but what the hell.   I've added a second mailing address to my public key, but this causes a  validity error (unknown sigantor) when checked with -kc.  How can I go about making that go away so that people who check will not be  greeted by this message?  Only been in PGP a week,
