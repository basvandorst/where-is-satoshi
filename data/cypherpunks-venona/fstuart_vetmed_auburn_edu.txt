@_subject: Government Accountability through Cryptography 
Recently, there have been many scandals (Ruby Ridge, Whitewater, the death of
Vince Foster, Waco) involving the government.  Even if the government is
completely innocent, the perception of corruption is damaging.  A big part of
the problem comes from claims that incriminating documents have been hidden,
destroyed, or altered.  I believe I have a solution.  If the government would
just encrypt (using 64 bit keys or less) all their internal documents and
publish them electronically, they could be checked when questions arise.  The
key should be held in escrow by a private company to be released only by court
order, executive order, or act of Congress.  Since this is very similar to
the administration's proposal on cryptography, I'm sure they won't object.
Perhaps we should lobby Congress.

Now that you mention it, it seems to me that completely anonymous tipsters
with the ability to receive ecash rewards would likely be a bigger boon to
law enforcement types than would easily tappable communications lines.  Is anyone in a position to set up a cypherpunks CrimeStoppers mailbox (for
use through the remailers)?  You could set up a web-page with instructions
and a list of crimes for which there are rewards.  Perhaps some civic
organiztions would be willing to donate money for tips leading to arrests
and convictions of any crimes.  Even if it doesn't catch any bad guys, it'd be
great PR for strong crypto, anonymity, ecash and whoever runs it.

This is a bit off-topic, but hopefully interesting.
Rather than trying to prove a program to be correct (which I agree is doomed
to failure for the forseeable future for all but trivial programs), perhaps
it would be useful to have an automated therom-prover to try to deduce
"interesting things" about certain programs such as "this program always
bounds-checks its input", "this program allows writes to arbitrary files on
lines x, y, and z", "this program halts". (:>)  Obviously (as the last example
illustrates), this isn't perfect because something can be true without being
provable.  Further, it's likely that assumptions must be made about system
calls, libraries, and the ways in which they interact.  There's also the
problem of "who proves the prover".  However, I think such a tool would be
useful because it may quickly point out things not obvious to (most) humans
and getting some idea of what can't be deduced and why would be instructive.

After talking to a couple of people, and playing around some, this seems
to be a better choice.  That way, you can actually send information (including
a list of where to get other browsers) instead of just garbage to netscape
users.  Is anyone aware of browsers other than Netscape that do client pulls?
A simple filter to do (and undo) this would still be useful, I think so that
users can easily fix all their documents.  Fortunately, that would be very
easy to write.
That's not a bad idea either.  Hopefully, Netscape will post a retraction
(soon!) and none of this will be necessary.

Well, I think configurable redirects based on User-Agent would be a good
thing.  However, if you don't control the server being used you can still
use client pull to redirect on a page-by-page basis.  I've been made aware
of at least one non-Netscape browser that does client pulls, so checking the
User-Agent would be desirable, but (AFAIK) that isn't possible without
modifying the server, using cgi, or something along those lines.
I've got the perl script to automatically add (and remove) the meta-http lines
to individual pages more or less done, but I won't release it just yet
(if at all).  Jeff Weinstein's promise to make Netscape's GAK policy
publically available is an important step in the right direction.  However,
whatever their policy statement ends up saying, it should be obvious that their
level of commitment to opposing GAK is minimal at best.

To avoid just saying "me too", I'll throw out another idea on making the U.S.
version of Netscape available to U.S. users over the Internet.  How about a
phone number to call to get an access id of some sort that can be used to
FTP the software.  When you call the number, you can use caller-id to verify
that the person is calling from within the U.S.  You could set up a BBS-type
system to do this automatically, or make the phone number a 900 number and
charge a few dollars to cover your costs.  You could also set up the access
id so that it can only be used once.

I certainly don't support the person or people responsible for this and it may
very well end up having an overall negative impact.  Since it has happened,
however, I think those in a position to do so should start with the spin
control.  Some suggestions:
   The fact that even the U.S. Justice Department is unable to adequately
   protect it's own site from intruders underscores the need for widely-
   available strong encryption.
   While this is certainly a major embarrassment for the Justice Department,
   at least the mandatory "key escrow" program the Clinton administration is
   insisting upon has not yet been implemented; no private citizens' data
   appears to have been compromised this time.
   It's doubtful that a new law or government bureaucracy would have prevented
   this from happening but it's entirely possible that tools such as strong
   encryption could have.  It's ironic that the U.S. Government is focusing on
   the former while fighting use of the latter.
This event could potentially draw a lot of interest from the general public.
Since we're dealing with public perceptions largely created through the main-
stream media, it's important to remember that "sound bites" are more important
than carefully reasoned arguments.

Since we don't know how the intruders broke in, we can only speculate.  I
can think of several scenarios where cryptographic techniques could help.
I can also think of several where they wouldn't.  When you've only got 20
seconds to explain to a non-technical audience, I don't think it's dishonest
to say that it might have prevented it.
Off the top of my head, here are a couple examples:
   1. It's possible that a DOJ employee logged in from a remote site while
      the intruders were snooping somewhere along the way.  If the link had
      been encrypted, that would have made things much more difficult or
      impossible for the attackers.
   2. Perhpas the intruders used IP spoofing and .rhosts to break in.  If
      machines had to be cryptographically authenticated, a rsh from the
      wrong machine wouldn't work.
