@_subject: This is fun!!! 
Would you like to send someone a letter from Bangkok ?
Well, you can! Put the letter to be remailed in a larger envelope with U.S.$3 cash and I will post it
from Bangkok bearing a Bangkok postmark to any country
in the world. If you want the letter to be registered
then enclose U.S.$4 cash. I will pay the postage from the enclosed fee. The letter must be lightweight air-
mail only containing not more than 2 sheets of writing
paper. Here's the address...
P.O. Box 3,
Bang Or, 10704, Bangkok, Thailand.
Please register your mail to me. A must for secret lovers.
Great for practical jokes and pranksters.
Inform your boss what you think about his ideas.
Tell your ex-wife/husband you're living in Bangkok.
Go on, give it a try it's great fun.
You can put as many envelopes in the larger one
as you like but you must enclose the fee for each remailed item. The 10th one goes free!
Mail to be remailed is sent the same day I
receive it unless you specify a date for it to be No rcords kept and you are completely anonymous
to me so don't put your name and address on any
of the envelopes.
Have fun!!!
