@_subject: CONTENT AND QUALITY NET DISCUSSION. 
GENTLEMEN,  MOST OF MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION ON THE NET HAVE BEEN BOTH
WELL THOUGHT AND INTELLECTUALLY "NON'TRIVIAL".  THE REMAILING OF MULTIPLE COPIES OF HIGH NOISE INFORMATION DRIBBLE WOULD CAUSE ME TO LOOK AT THE TRAFFIC ON THE NET AND AS : IS IT WORTH IT?
RIGHT NOW, THE NUMBER OF UNSUBSCRIBE MESSAGES LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT.  IF THIS IS WHAT TOAD WANTS, SO BE IT. IF THERE IS AN INDIVIDUAL AMONG YOU THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A CASE FOR CONTINUED SUBSCRIPTION, I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE SERIOUS REPLY'S.
