I predict that naughty cypherpunks will use these passwords to repeatedly
add the following names to "Schlomo"'s list of contacts:
If that doesn't work, really naughty cypherpunks may also add the addresses
of prominent journalists.
Of course, those things would be WRONG.

Pressing an obscure key combination during bootup to trigger the password
prompt should do the trick.

Mr. Bernstein's own site ( has, as far as I
can tell, absolutely no external links.  I don't know whether this is a
recent modification in order not to undermine his case or it simply
reflects Mr. Bernstein's view of how the web should be.
It's hard to imagine him winning the case.  (God help him if he does;
that's a lot of angry netizens.)

Judging from the webpage, this is personal finance software (ala Quicken)
and doesn't seem to aspire to providing digital cash or electronic wallet

In the case of my US bank it's the opposite:  ATM withdrawals, unless I use
a machine owned by my bank, cost me US$1.50.  Credit card fees on the other
hand are paid by the merchant, who is contractually bound NOT to pass them
on to me.
My debit card functions as both ATM and credit card.  When given a choice I
will always prefer to use it as a credit card, which costs me nothing.
