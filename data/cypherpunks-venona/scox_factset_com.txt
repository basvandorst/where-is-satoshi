According to Matt Blaze:
[[ Prelude about MS Cryptography API deleted ]]
surreptitious tampering?  What I'm wondering is if it will be possible
to "drop in" a new (signed) crypto.dll (that just happens to
forward cleartext to the DLL author, or perhaps uses intentionally deficient (or just fixed) keys) when installing, for example, the latest
game craze distributed on the Internet?
crypto engines if those can be replaced with *ANY* other crypto engine at
any time (note for the paranoid: Imagine "NSA the Game" for Windows(TM) with
the new "Send the Feds a copy" encryption DLL--that last part in fine print
of coures :)
that hasn't been mentioned yet, but this kind of jumps out at me when I
think of drop-in DLLs (anyone ever see how well the WINSOCK.DLL scheme
works? God Forbid that an encryption scheme be subject to the same problems!)
