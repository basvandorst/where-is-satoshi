Sure sounds like it. I wonder if they are watching the messages that addresses are being stripped from? I believe this is my first post here(at least in quite a while). Lets see what happens, shall we?

Exactly. An that's where the control should stay. In my view the 'net' should be like a giant world-wide library. You can get good stuff and you can get bad stuff and it is up the parents to regulate what the kids get. Passing the buck to the net authorities just circumvents the parent's control of the material. What if there is something that I want my kid to access and the 'authorities' say that it cannot be allowed until they turn 18.
  Raising kids the way you believe is all part of the 1st amendment. When then state starts telling you how to raise them(as it already is in some states) then you have just lost one of your greatest freedoms and rights.
  But the state always knows whats best, right? Have you heard that the ABC documentry on Waco has been postponed under pressure from the WH until after the crime bill is voted on? Heard his on the radio the other day.
  An interesting thing that I learned in anthropology last quarter. Out teacher likes to goo of on tangents and give useful info. According to him the Bureau of Indian Affairs(BIA) sent the Indian kids to BIA school on other completely different reservations in order to break down the transfer of the Indian culture from the elders in the tribes to the children.   If you don't transfer your culture(whatever it may be, religious, anti-government, etc) to your kids then it is lost. If the governemnt is the one doing the 'cultural development' of your kids then where is that going to leave us in a generation or two?
