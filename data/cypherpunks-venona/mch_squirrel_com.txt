Undoubtedly, they'll set things up so that if one modifies the software to break the escrow feature, one won't be able to interoperate with "legitimate" users (i.e. those who haven't disabled the escrow feature).

GNU tar is not the commercial backup solution many folks will be looking for, but it works, and has nice built-in hooks which are intended to call a compression program. One can also use these options to call an encryption program, as long as the encryption program takes stdin as input, stdout as output, encrypts by default, and decrypts when given the -d option. e.g. if the encryption program happens to be called /usr/local/bin/mg,
something like
gtar --use-compress-program /usr/local/bin/mg --block-compress -b 96 -cvf /dev/rst0 directory
will backup "directory" to tape in encrypted form under Sun OS 4.1.3
It also has support for incrementals, etc.

If you run /usr/etc/devinfo -vp (Sun OS 4.1.x), or /usr/sbin/prtconf -vp

clock-frequency:  02625a00
This is the clock frequency in hexadecimal in Hz.
The above example is from an IPX (40 MHz).

This all goes back to the familiar lesson for all of us reading this newsgroup, the easy way to break most practical applications of cryptography is to find a way to "work around" or "subvert" the cryptosystem being used. Consider two popular UNIX licence managers
FlexLM - uses weak cryptography by default to produce licence keys, although vendors can plug in their own Elan (V4.1 and above) - can use DES or a 5-rotor enigma. Both of these
are better cryptosystems than that used by FlexLM.
Now, does anyone here think that Elan is significantly harder to crack than FlexLM because it uses better cryptography than FlexLM? I hope not. The Elan marketing literature makes the use of DES sound like a big advantage. But, it doesn't make any difference to the cracker. There is actually some good content in the marketing goo at
if you're willing to sift through it.
Writing and debugging a floating network licence manager which is reliable and multiplatform is hard. For a real challenge, try and put in some sort of redundancy (multiple hosts), and keep everything sane. The danger for a software vendor is that they end up with a good software product, which has a licence manager that makes it unreliable and causes problems for customers. I've seen this happen a few times. In this senario, customers often abandon the product and stop paying for support and upgrades, which are a significant part of the income of a software vendor. If word gets around (and it will), that your licence manager is buggy will adversely effect new sales. I'm a sysadmin, and every time a licence manager craps out and needs to be restarted, users can't use their software until they can get a hold of me. For some products (I'm not going to mention names), this happens on a more or less weekly basis. Licence manager malfunctions are relatively rare with products like FlexLM and Elan. The home-grown licence managers tend to be a real problem from a systems
administration point of view. Here are my free (and worth every penny you paid) recommendations
to a software vendor considering some sort of software based licence management scheme.
1. Trust your customers (best choice!!!) and concentrate your efforts on producing good quality software. This way you'll get more customers, etc. Crackers will be able to get around any sort of licence-management scheme anyway (just check out Usenet newsgroups devoted to binary mods to unlock applications and distributing keys for applications) 2. Buy an off-the-shelf licence manager which has a good track-record. It will already have the worst bugs worked out. Better to spend time working on improving the software you are trying to licence. 3. If you must roll-your-own, avoid trying to write a network-floating licence scheme. These are harder to write and have a lot more potential to turn an otherwise good product into a worthless piece of crap. 4. If you must roll-your-own network-floating licence manager, be prepared to expend a lot of time and effort debugging and testing. Be sure to build in some sort of redundancy
I mention FlexLM and Elan because I know a fair bit about them. This isn't
an endorsement, etc.

Ease of backup is one of the strengths of CFS which is a cryptographic
filesystem for various flavours of UNIX and Linux.
With CFS the encrypted files live in the ordinary UNIX filesystem (their names are also encrypted), so one can backup encrypted data without decrypting to make things intelligible and then encrypting to secure the tape. Backups take no more time than backups of ordinary unencrypted files and don't require any special tools (ufsdump, GNU tar, GNU cpio work fine). You backup files individually, which means you can also restore them individually, i.e. without restoring a whole partition. Of course, this doesn't solve your problem, because you are running Windows. But CFS might be incentive to also run a more feature-rich
operating system on your PC. You don't need to give up DOS/Windows
to also run Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Unixware, etc.

It isn't terribly fast, but one hardly notices when one is dealing with the overhead of encrypting and decrypting the data anyway.

@_subject: Re: Encrypted file systems 
There are a couple of advantages to this sort of approach (i.e. having the encrypted filesystem live in file(s) on an ordinary filesystem) other than ease of use. 1. Backups are easy. One can use whatever backup software one normally
2. The encrypted filesystem can actually live on a remote file server with data being encrypted/decrypted on the fly on the local host. (of course, you have to consider the security risks that you get from being on a network).

@_subject: Re: Internal Passports 
Driver's licence and social security card are currently enough.
Before 1989 (or so, I'm not sure about the cutoff) the SSA issued unrestricted social security cards to people on temporary visas who had authorization to work for some period (e.g. students on an F-1 visa could then work on campus - and the SSA would issue an ordinary unrestricted social security card). After 1989, I understand, that social security cards issued under these circumstances are marked "not valid for employment without INS documentation" or something similar. So, it is perfectly possible to have a social security card and a driver's licence without having the right to work in the U.S. The I-9 documentation doesn't prove anything. I note that California requires some sort of documentation (birth cert, INS documentation etc.) for a new driver's licence. Don't know
about other states.  probably related story:
This might explain why in 1994 when I was travelling back home to Vancouver B.C. from Europe via the states (cheap ticket), the U.S. immigration officer asked me "Do you have a social security number?". I said yes. She then asked "do you have your social security card with you?" I didn't have it, and said so. She asked to see my ticket on to Vancouver, and that was it. I thought it was weird at the time as I'm used to various questions, and hearing one that I didn't expect at least made the experience mildly interesting.

I'm wondering if they'll implement this by blocking direct connectivity from their customers machines for TCP with the destination ports commonly used by http, ftp, etc. thus allowing people to do things not supported by the proxy and to get around the blocking pretty easily, or if they'll just block all direct IP connectivity between their customers and the rest of the Internet, so people in Singapore will be reduced to viewing the Internet as nothing more than the WWW.
