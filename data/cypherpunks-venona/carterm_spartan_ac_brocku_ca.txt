Hi Everyone.
I've been lurking on this very interesting list, but I figured this needed
to be commented on. ;-)
This kind of fascism has, IMO, doomed PGP 2.6 before it's even met full
release status.  Not only do I disagree with the principles behind this,
but it shuts out the rest of the world from reading messages originating
in Canada and the U.S., which more than anything else will kill PGP 2.6. After all, the world most certainly does not revolve around North America.
I'd say that it's high time for another European release of PGP.

Of course this controversy would exist among women on the net, because
women who _are_ on the net aren't intimidated by the technology.
As a portrait of people who _aren't_ on the net, it would be fairly accurate,
for both men and women.

No doubt this will eventually be marketed as a feature you can pay
extra for... intended so people can track their spouses' movements
so they know when they're getting home, if they're stuck in a traffic
jam, etc.
Such "legitimate" uses don't really make the prospect of carrying a
device to track my every movement all that attractive, unless of course
I can turn off that feature by flicking a switch on my phone.

The implications in the field of industrial espionage leap quickly to mind.
Beyond that, unrestrained encryption is dangerous to corporations, because
what's to stop a ticked off employee from encrypting everything in the office
as revenge for some imagined slight?
Encryption as a weapon is something that's not often talked about, despite
the fact that everyone's always rambling about how valuable information
The arguments for restraining encryption in corporate situations can
go on and on... just as the arguments for encouraging private encryption
can go on and on.

I see your point.
Encryption could be used as a secure means of storage of accumulated material
(on site) until a security gap can be found, though.  And if anyone does any
snooping, they can't see through the encryption to see if it's really company
secrets, thus protecting the spy.
Again, encryption is sort of a nice safety net.  They can catch you with the
tape, but they've only got you on suspicion of espionage, and the evidence
is encrypted.
I was thinking more about data being held hostage.
Encryption offers the possibility of restoring the information... no doubt
for a price of some sort.  Few companies would like to admit to being
blackmailed in this fashion.
Sabotage, on the other hand, is much less flexible, and hence would be the
practice of comparative amateurs.  If you destroy everything, and get caught,
what do you have to bargain with?
