a locked startup disk is not a good idea, if it is even possible.
Most applications setup scratch space on the startup volume.  It would
be a better idea to setup a partition for applications and lock it, if
you feel that is necessary.  Norton DiskLock is a nice tool that
provides a startup password protection as well as screensaver
password.  It will request a password if the machine sleeps or to
reboot after a crash.

I always try to have a good time with airport security.  Last time I
flew I had a brand new stainless steel nissan thermos half full of
scotch in my backpack in addition to my laptop, a handful of dental
tools and a bunch of sticks of microcrystaline wax.
The rentacop almost shit all over himself tearing into my bag trying
to find out what the nissan was and i'm pretty sure that he did when
he saw the sticks of wax.  Course I was busy being frisked by another
guard (steel toes, steel shanks) and was really trying hard not to
Next time I'm planning on painting some messages in lead paint and
sticking them in a folder so they can read it as it gets scanned.
Nice friendly hello A. Gulkis
