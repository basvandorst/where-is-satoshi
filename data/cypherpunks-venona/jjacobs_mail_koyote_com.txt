I just got passed this, don't know the context, nor the thread.  Clancy was
NOT a Navy captain.  He does tons of research for his books....his advisor
IS a retired Navy Captain named J.M. Rodgers.  How do I know?  I also use
Captain Rodgers as a consultant, AND, I e-mail with Clancy a couple or three
times a week. BTW: I'm a retired U.S. Navy Chief Journalist. HTH.
