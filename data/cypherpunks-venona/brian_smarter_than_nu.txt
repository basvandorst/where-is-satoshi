I've always been told that software with function hooks for crypto was
just as unexportable as crypto itself.  This however doesn't make any
sense, because then anything with a plugin interface falls into that
category.  Hell, anything that can call external programs would qualify as
having a plugin interface, and all web browsers, mail/news readers, IRC
clients, editors, and possibly even all operating systems would fall into
that category.  Of course, this is the goobermint we're dealing with...
what did we expect but another arbitrary-arrest law.

"Good afternoon, Microsoft technical support."
"This is TWA Flight 800.  Our avionics system just shit itself!  Something
about a segmentation violation in the hydrolics interface driver!"
"Hmm.  Did you try rebooting it?"
"Yes, several times!  Losing attitude control!"
"Hmm.  This may require a reinstall of the operating system then.  Please
hold for a moment while I connect you to one of our reinstallation support
"No! Wait!  The center fuel tank's thermostat control dialog is full of
random garbage now!  *SCREAM* *BOOM*"
... And in today's news, despite a leaked report from the NTSB that it was
not "digital sabotage," but a critical bug in Microsoft Windows NT for
Avionics that was responsible for the crash of TWA Flight 800, President
Clinton has asked Congress to introduce legislation that would enable the
FBI to monitor so-called computer hackers more carefully through digital
wiretaps and mandatory key escrow, to "save the children from the
info-terrorists on the other side of the Bridge to the Twenty-First
Century."  Microsoft is not commenting at this time, but a source within
the company has informed us that a fix for the "center fuel tank bug" will
be included in NT for Avionics Service Pack 4, to be released in the first
quarter of 1998.

Algebra.com is down, so I'm resending this through cyberpass.  Gotta love

Should be relatively trivial to break the encryption, since it can't be
over 40-bit (or 56-bit if the company joined the kiss-ass alliance).
Probably just as easy or easier to disassemble the software or do some
creative tweaking of Windows DLLs to intercept data.  Custom hardware is
probably out due to cost and distribution problems, and even with it, it's
still possible to intercept data between the hardware and the software, or
the software and the OS.

Ut oh.  Now the government is going to protect us from the new Horseman,
copyright violators, by mandating diskless network computers that run
only government-approved software.  We can't let those awful hackers
unlawfully disassemble software for the purpose of stealing other data,
now can we?  After all, it's for the children... and this solves that
pesky strong crypto problem too.

Actually, it's legal to possess bubonic plague bacteria, and anthrax as
well.  It's even possible to order anthrax from the same lab that supplied
Harris with the bubonic plague bacteria, and this is reportedly the same
lab that supplied Iraq with its anthrax.  According to Harris, all you
need to provide is a lab ID number, and in fact, this is what Harris was
prosecuted for -- illegal use of the ID number for the lab he worked at.

Yes, quite funny.  "The computer is connected to the ... Internet!  This
could be a window of opportunity for the lawmen!"  Disappointing, however. I was hoping they'd have a bit on UV laser stunguns or ultrasonic
confusion weapons.  I'd love to have one of those "metamorphic camoflage" suits, though. :)  Are they even remotely plausible?

@_subject: Re: Will New Sendmail Block Remailers? 
I doubt it.  NYT is probably referring to the integration into the
sendmail package of rules that nix incoming mail with forged From headers,
e.g. "you.want.to and prevent unauthorized relaying.  Remailers
generally use a From header that includes their own legitimate domain, so
they likely won't be blocked.  However, while the anti-relay-hijacking
rules are useful (and LONG overdue), I see the the From-domain-validity
change as a Bad Thing, as it will encourage spammers to deliberately
choose existing domains to spoof in their From lines, leading to an
increase in the incidences of sites being subjected to fragmented
denial-of-service attacks, i.e. being mailbombed by the collective
complaints of all those shit-stupid AOLers who don't bother to read the
Received headers.  I've been lucky enough never to have been subjected to
one of those attacks, but from the sheer volume of complaints I once got
when a luser sent a MMF spam to USENET, I can sympathize with the victim
of a spoof.
   Yet another instance of "protection for the masses" actually providing
no real benefit and simultaneously negating the protection afforded to
those few who had previously used the defense.  A similar thing has
happened/is happening with the previously-useful "Comments: Authenticated
sender is" check for spam, which used to be nearly 95% effective at nixing
spam because most known spamming packages included the header, and only
one legitimate mailer did likewise, but was easy to make exceptions for
because it included an identifying X-Mailer header.

I'd love to see them try to enforce that.  What about chaffing and

of the actual rules concerning this?

According to one of the READMEs that comes with a public domain
implementation of the PKZIP crypto algorithm, there is a known-plaintext
attack against it described at If it's 8 or less lower-case letters, it would seem that it's probably
crackable in a reasonable amount of time on a high-end desktop PC or
workstation.  Anything more would probably require a distributed attack.

Incorrect.  A parking ticket, like a speeding ticket or other minor
traffic violations is classified as an "infraction", not a misdemeanor.
Apparently, even the govts. recognizes that there are so many laws on the
books now that one can't possibly hope to avoid breaking them.
