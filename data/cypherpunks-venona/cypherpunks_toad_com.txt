Welcome to the cypherpunks mailing list.
We have a real mailing list now, and not just a mail alias on my
account.  Thanks to John Gilmore for space on hoptoad and Hugh Daniel
for setting things up.
Mail to the list members at
Request additions or deletions, talk to the list maintainer (me, Eric
Hughes) at
Tell your friends about the list and have them join if they wish, and
have them do the same, but please do not post the list address yet.
We'd like to have a core group working before we advertise to avoid
diffusion of interest at the outset.
Second Meeting -- October 10, 1992
The second meeting will be held at the new Cygnus offices.  Exact
address and directions to follow.
We do not have an exact agenda yet, but one should be arriving in the
next few days.  Please mark you calendars now and start telling your
For this meeting and until further announced, we are using a
transitive trust system for invitations.  Invite anybody you want and
let them invite anybody they want and so on.
The crypto-anarchy game we tried out at the first meeting was as good
a success as we could have hoped for from an untested idea.  The game
seems useful and fun enough to warrant continued play and play
testing, so we'll be playing again at this and future meetings.  We observed several interesting emergent behaviors in the first
session, including resellers and reputation behaviors.  We'll play a
two hour session this time and discuss it afterwards.

@_subject: Matchbook reminders for EFF / Cypherpunk members 
At a friend's house I found a matchbook printed up by NORML.  It
serves to advertise the organization, as well as providing information
useful during legal troubles.
It got me thinking about matchbooks or wallet cards as a good way to
make people aware of us.  (Matchbooks work better when your
organization is concerned with smokables...)  Someone mentioned a few
weeks ago that we need to have a wallet-sized card that reminds people
of their rights when they get into hassles.  Experience has shown that
we forget and bungle it, without a reminder.
The NORML front cover says:		Cypherpunk version (strawman):
The spine:
The back:
    You must be 18 or older to call)
The inside:
    You must be 18 or older to call)
A tract I cut out of a gay newspaper some years ago is in my
wallet now; its advice is:
ACT-UP/New York's clip-and-save guide to police intimidation
The following guidelines were formulated by legal advisors to ACT
UP/NY, but they apply to all gay men and lesbians and activists.
1. You do not have to talk to the police or FBI or any other
investigators.  You do not have to talk to them whether they come
to your house, on the street, if you've been arrested, or even if you
are in jail.  Only a court or a grand jury has legal authority to
compel testimony.
2.  You don't have to let the police or FBI into your home or office
unless they show you an arrest or search warrant which authorizes them
to enter that SPECIFIC place.
3.  If they do present a warrant, you do not have to tell them
anything other than your name and address.  You have a right to
observe what they do.
4.  Make written notes, including the agents' names, agency and badge
numbers.  Try to have other people present as witnesses and have them
make written notes, too.
5.  Anything you do say to any law enforcement officer may be used
against you and other people.
6.  If you do give the FBI or police information, it may mean that you
will have to testify to the same information at a trial or before a
grand jury.
7.  Lying to an FBI agent or other federal investigators is a crime.
8.  The best advice, if the FBI or police try to question you or to
enter your home or office without a warrant, is to JUST SAY NO!  Law
enforcement agents have a job to do and they are highly skilled at it.
Attempting to "outwit" them is very risky.  YOU CAN NEVER TELL HOW A SEEMINGLY HARMLESS BIT OF INFORMATION CAN HELP THEM HURT YOU OR
ANOTHER ACT UP MEMBER.
9.  The investigators may threaten you with a grand jury subpoena if
you don't give them information.  But you may get one anyway, and
anything you've already told them will be the basis for more detailed
questioning under oath.
10.  They may try to threaten or intimidate you by pretending to have
information about you ("We know what you've been doing, but if you
cooperate it will be all right.")  If you are concerned about this,
tell them you will consider talking to them with your lawyer present.
11.  If you are nervous about simply refusing to talk, you may find it
easier to tell them to contact your lawyer.  Once a lawyer is
involved, the agents usually pull back since they have lost their
power to intimidate.  If you are taken into police custory, once you
request an attorney, they MUST cease questioning until your lawyer is
present.  But remember, you don't have to answer their questions, even
if they keep asking.

In reply to your:
I dunno, but the Aug/Sept 1993 issue of PC Techniques magazine
contains a notice on page 100 of the publication of something that
might be useful. It's a C library of encryption routines (Microsoft
and Borland compatible). "The encryption method is a symmetric key
encryption process applicable both to blocks of data in RAM ... and
also to data residing in disk files. ...  Full source code is
included ..."   Unfortunately it's not free (though I don't suppose
there's any reason why it should be).  The notice says further details

@_author: by giving them the IDEA key 
@_subject: Re: Scientology tries to break PGP - and fails? 
There was a hack to pgp ui published a while back that would allow
someone decrypting a RSA encrypted file to print out the idea key.
Another feature of the hack allowed someone with the idea key to decrypt
an RSA PGP encrypted file ignoring the RSA headers and using the IDEA
key directly.
Using this software should allow the reciever of an RSA PGP encrypted
file to allow someone else to decrypt it (by giving them the IDEA key)
without exposing the secret key. The IV block check will  allow them to
check that they are using the correct idea key.

@_subject: ITAR / S 1726 / Civil Disobedience 
Dear Mr. President,
   I am writing to express my disapproval of the Clinton Administration's
position on the ITAR restrictions for encryption software.  This is an
important issue to me.
  1) Software is writing, so it is protected by the first amendment,      so the ITAR is unconstitutional.  The idea that only paper books
     are first amendment protected, and electronic books are not, is just      plain wrong.
  2) The ITAR does not help National Security, but in fact greatly reduces      our nations security because the Internet, and the computers and      information connected to it, are kept from using good Encryption.    3) I feel that encryption is very important for doing commerce on the      Internet, and that commerce on the Internet is important for our      economy (Internet is the fastest growing sizable segment).  You say      you like the "Information Super Highway" and you are "going to focus      on the economy like a laser".  You should be removing the ITAR      restrictions on American businesses.  Otherwise the business for      commerce software will go to companies in other countries.
  4) The Clinton Clipper III proposal to have government key escrow      is not acceptable.  Also, it will never work, since people will      always be able to buy and use software from the rest of the world.       This proposal is just slowing down Internet progress.  Please
     cancel Clipper III.
  4) I really don't want to vote for a president who would continue this
     type of regulation of the Internet.  The Republican candidate
     Bob Dole and the Libertarian candidate Harry Browne support      Senator Burns Pro-CODE bill S 1726 that would end this foolishness.       The current law, (see      says that "The President shall periodically review the items on      the United States Munitions List to determine what items, if any,      no longer warrant export controls under this section.  The results      of such reviews shall be reported to the Speaker of the House [...]      at least 30 days before any item is removed from the Munitions      List [...]."       It seems either of your two rivals would, if president, end the
     control of software.  Will we have to elect one of them president      to remove software from the Munitions list?
  5) As an act of civil disobedience I have personally exported an      encryption program (it is 3 lines of writing) using the web page at      Yours sincerely,

  Your initial post to the list has been digitally classified by the Cypherpunks Automated Response system in order to determine the initial
level of reputation capital you will be awarded as a new member of the
Cypherpunks Mailing List (TcM).
Your initial entry level on the Cypherpunks Mailing List (TcM) will be:
               *** Level 2 ***
                    MORON
               *** Level 2 ***
  Level 2 is the lowest entry level available. From Level 2, you may
move up to other levels, at which the pinnacle is Cypherpunk Elite, or
down to Level 1, which each member of the Cypherpunks Mailing List (TcM)
has his or her own pet name for.
  Your reputation capital is increased or decreased according to the
quality and frequency of your posts. (Please note that, as is the case
with one's private parts, bigger is not necessarily better.)

Thus, once again, the higher levels are not necessarily better and you
may be subject to support and praise, or attack and condemnation, no
matter what the content or quality of your posts. The source of your
support on the list, or the attacks against you, may change from time
to time depending on which list member is having a "Bad Algorithm Day."
Also be advised that due to the highly technical nature of some of the
mathematical concepts addressed on the list, it is possible to move
beyond Level 0 (Flame Ony/No Content) and into negative levels of
reputation capital such as Level -1 (where your Doppleganger sends
10 copies of your own posts back to you).
At Reputation Capital levels below -1, you may be subjected to shame,
humiliation and filtering to the point where the only hope for your
posts being read is for you to post to the list anonymously, as a
"Monger" of one sort or another.

@_subject: take The Boulder Pledge now!!! 
Eventually, all spam, and spamscam, would stop if everyone followed the advice of film critic Roger Ebert.  He wrote in *Yahoo*:
Last spring I was on a panel about "Bad Manners on the Net" at the Conference on World Affairs at the University of Colorado.  We agreeed that junk e-mail (then no more than a mote in the eye) could eventually bring the whole cooperative endeavor of online mail crashing to its ruin.  On the spot, I devised the Boulder Pledge, and we solemnly crossed our hearts and took it.                              The Boulder Pledge
                Under no circumstances will I ever purchase                 *anything* offered to me as the result of an
                unsolicited e-mail message.  Nor will I                 forward chain letters, petitions, mass mailings,
                or virus warnings to large numbers of others.
                This is my contribution to the survival of                 the online community.
The Boulder Pledge works by making junk mail unprofitable.  If nobody *ever buys anything,* spammers eventually will quit.  I hope.
End the Plague.  Raise your right hand.  Read aloud [the Boulder Pledge].  Then, pass it on, via Email to 10 or 20 of your concerned
friends.  Thanks.

  No it doesn't. Haven't you heard of strong crypto?
  Thank you for pointing out that Phil Zimmerman wishes to protect me,
and Judge Patel wishes, on behalf of the government, to "eliminate the
protections" which strong encryptions affords me.
  The governement can't even protect themself, let alone the citizens,
as evidenced by the fact that the current sport of teenage hackers
across the nation is to send strong encryption overseas by way of the
government's email systems. (Can you say FBI? Sure you can! Can you say IRS? Sure you can!) Yet these dweebs want to destroy an industry that *is* capable of providing the citizens protection? (Considering the INSLAW affair, perhaps it would be more fitting to say "destroy _another_ industry.")
  I hope these idiots are having fun and making lots of money playing
their dinosaur games, because they are certainly accomplishing the
opposite of what they claim to be trying to do.
  The most that the dinosaurs in D.C. can manage to do, is to drag all
of the American business interests down into the ashes of history with
them as they attempt to build an Electromagnetic Curtain behind which
to imprison their citizens.
  Well, the CypherPunks were digging tunnels before the government even
knew they were predestined to build the Wall, so the fascist censors are sucking hind-tit and will, in all likelihood, continue to do so.

"InfoWar is back!" Jonathan cried out, waking
the other members of the Magic Circle instantly. They quickly
rose and gathered around the GraphiScreen hovering over the old
oak table.
Does the fireBot work well with the throwemupagainstthewallandaimfortheheadBot?
Cowboy recognized the significance immediately. "A thousand
Points of Presence."
"UUNET...WorldCom?" Alexis asked, surprised.
Jonathan nodded, adding, "And they're moving faster and
quieter than they did in history as we have known it, up to now."
He began reading off the list he had compiled in just a short
time, "Fiber, Digital Microwave, Satellite, Undersea Fiber
Cable. Financial markets, telecommunications, construction, health
care, and politics.
"They seem to be putting all of the 'usual suspects' under
one flag, around the globe."
A Player To Be Named Later scanned the series of posts, for the
thousandth time. "It's dejavu, all over again." he said, quoting
a Yogi Berra malapropism.
The feeling had been growing on him...
The feeling that somehow, everything was the same as before...only
"The Lake of Life has started to
turn over. The bottom is rising to the top, the top is descending
to the bottom, and everything is becoming the opposite of what
it seems to be."
A Player To Be Named Later sat quietly, contemplating what it
was that had changed, only somehow not changed, since the last
time the lake had turned over on the CypherPunks mailing list.
He thought about "WebWorld & the Mythical Circle of Eunuchs."
He began to see the parallel between the history of the creation
of WebWorld and the creation of the CypherPunks distributed list.
There was the subterfuge which had preceded both the Channel Revolution
which foreshadowed WebWorld and the Censorship Crisis which had
presaged the CypherPunks distributed mailing list.
There were the climaxes that precipitated the structural changes
in both cases, the satellite destruction in the one case, and
the loss of toad.com as host to the mailing list in the other
case. There were the parallels with outside attacks ceasing on
both the CypherPunks distributed mailing lists and the variety
of Channels on WebWorld, in an attempt to let the citizens/members
bond with their new channels/lists.
One parallel-or two, depending on how you looked at it-in particular,
which stood out in the mind of A Player To Be Named Later.
There were three CypherPunks distributed lists-at algebra.com,
ssz.com, and at cyberpass.net.
Likewise, there was a reference to the Money Channel Government
in WebWorld having three channels under its control.
Then, there was the strange, strange saga of three religious channels-the
God Channel, the Dualist Channel, and the Trinity Channel-which
had somehow merged, yet not merged, creating a problem which had
left the 'powers that be' very, very nervous.
"What the hell happened to Channel War I?" A
Player To Be Named Later, asked himself, suddenly recognizing
a glaring disparity between the parallels he was drawing between
the history of WebWorld and the history of the CypherPunks list.
"And what the hell happened to InfoWar?" he asked,
turning to Baby, who stood up and barked her agreement that there
was definitely something fishy going on that involved the two
shadow wars that had somehow been misplaced in the annals of history-one
in the future, and one in the past.
In 'WebWorld', both the reference to the three Money Channel Governments
and reference to the three spiritual channels which became one,
yet didn't, revolved around the close of Channel War I. But there
didn't seem to be a parallel to Channel War I in the Time-Line
of the CypherPunks list.
Likewise, 'WebWorld' began with a reference to an 'InfoWar Scrambler
Mechanism' which seemed to indicate that 'InfoWar' would play
a major part in the history of 'WebWorld & the Mythical Circle
of Eunuchs.' Yet there were only a few later references in Part
II of The True Story of the InterNet in regard to "the beginning
stages of InfoWar," with no further details.
A Player To Be Named Later strained to touch the wispy haze of
memory which was rising somewhere in the back of his mind-a memory
which whispered "InfoWar" from somewhere deep
in the heart of the CypherPunks mailing list censorship crisis.
"Toto!" he said, suddenly feeling a ferocious
stinging sensation behind his right ear, which resulted in a loss
of balance as he fell to the floor, and a loss of consciousness
as the blackness closed in around him...
The tattered remnants of the Magic Circle of the future sat quietly
around the antique oak table, anxious and depressed.
"Why is the Trei Transponder receiving interference from
Toto's digital implant?" Priscilla asked the group. "All
of my monitoring tests show that the last adjustments we made
to the Zooko Zamboni were up to Journeyman standards."
"Perhaps it is a result of the differences in the winter
climates between the Netherlands and Canada." Jonathan
"It seems to me that the effects of Global Warming were
just beginning to have undeniably noticeable effects in that particular
 epoch."
The Cowboy got up and paced a bit, as the others realized he was
working up the courage to say what they were all thinking.
"Or.." he hesitated, then turned to face the
others and continued, "perhaps the rebirth of InfoWar
reflects that our efforts toward changing the past have not only
been successful, but are now irrevocable."
Jonathan pulled up a passage of 'WebWorld' onto the GraphiScreen,
contemplating what he had originally perceived as the failure
of InfoWar during the hotly contested battle which took place
on the CypherPunks list during the censorship crisis.
"January 19, 1997.
"The beginning date of the 'moderation experiment' on the
legendary CypherPunks mailing list. The beginning probe in preparation
for the launching of InfoWar-an experiment which had failed miserably
and had caused a delay in the plans of the Evil One. A delay caused
by the damnable insolence of the terminal misfits among the CypherPunks.
An insolence that was rumored to be fueled by the Circle of Eunuchs,
fanning the 'flames' of dissent among the CypherPunks, helping
them to resist the herding of their list members into the group-mindset
desired by the Evil One."
The other members of the Circle of Eunuchs sat still in their
seats, not wanting to disturb the deep thoughts of Jonathan, who
was indeed the Last True CypherPunk, having grown up at their
feet, immersed in their logic and their lore, and whose whole
life had been ruled by his connection to the infamous anarchists
who had been, alternately, both the shining light of freedom and
privacy in their era, and the treacherous instigators of Channel
War II-the war which had led to the ultimate triumph of the Gomez
and the Dark Allies and the conclusive ascent of the Dark Forces
in their domination of WebWorld under the dictum of the Evil One.
The room was quiet as Jonathan reluctantly pulled up the next
passage of 'WebWorld' which had described his feelings when his
bereft past had come back to haunt him.
"Jonathan sat frozen in his seat, once again, his brain
locked from the major dichotomies being produced as a result of
his present-in which the CypherPunks were a villainous band of
rogues who had instigated the launching of Channel War II-and
his past, in which his grandfather had been exposed both as one
of the major players in both the launching of Channel War II,
and as traitorous scum who had sabotaged the goals of the CypherPunks
in that same historical battle.
"Jonathan's grandfather wasn't just a CypherPunk. He was
the Fool."
"We won..." Jonathan's voice trailed off,
before he rose from the table and repeated his statement, in anger.
"We won, damn it!
"I know we won. Grandfather knew we won the censorship
battle. Everyone knew that we won the censorship
battle. History itself knows that we won...we..."
Jonathan stopped short, turning to stare at the others, who were
staring back.
"Jonathan..." Bubba said softly. "History
has changed."
"I know that, damn it!" Jonathan resumed
his pacing, knowing that he was missing something very, very important,
but he couldn't for the life of him think what it might possibly
The others in the room watched and waited, knowing that it was
Jonathan, and Jonathan alone, whose heritage was intricately and
irrevocably linked to the era in history which they had, for better
or worse, interfered in through their use of the Trei Transponder.
"Grandfather was a traitor to the CypherPunks...a traitor
to freedom and privacy. He sabotaged everything that the CypherPunks
had fought so hard to defend, since the inception of their anarchist,
cryptography mailing list.
  "But the CypherPunks loved us..."
Jonathan was lost in memories of a childhood in which he and his
family had been forced to remain in constant motion, staying a
half-step ahead of the Dark Allies, who had been hunting down
the last remaining members of the CypherPunks-with a vengeance.
His family had been soundly welcomed by the remaining CypherPunks,
in their flight to freedom after his Grandfather's assassination.
They had given the family food, clothing, shelter, and warned
them when the Dark Allies were closing in, and it was once again
time to flee. Duncan Frissell had even...
Perhaps they all had...
Jonathan sank to the floor, slowly, with Alexis leaping up and
catching him softly. Cowboy helped her guide him toward the table
and lower him into a chair.
Jonathan slowly pulled off his shirt and stared at his tattoo...the
Mark of the Toad.
"Duncan Frissell arrived at our last safe house, in the
middle of the night." Jonathan spoke, finally understanding
the real story behind his family's flight into obscurity.
"He warned us to flee, but it was too late...the Dark
Allies were close at hand."
Jonathan's voice was full of amazement as he recounted an event
which he had long known, but had never managed to fully understand.
"Duncan held the Dark Allies at bay, while we made our
escape. I can still hear his screams..." Jonathan
shuddered, then began shaking terribly. Alexis closed her arms
around him, hugging him lightly.
"Your Grandfather knew that the CypherPunks had
lost the battle." Bubba picked up the thread.
The other members of the Magic Circle looked on, mystified as
to this strange turn of events which turned the whole history
of the CypherPunks and the Circle of Eunuchs on hits head.
"It wasn't a censorship battle." the Cowboy said,
amazed as much by what he was saying as those listening to him
"It was InfoWar!"
"That's what happened to InfoWar." Alexis
cried out, in disbelief of her own words. "It was over
before it had begun."
Bubba d'Shauneaux IV rose to his feet, and filled in the details
of the battle as could only be done by one who had spent a lifetime
of subterfuge playing a role which was the exact opposite of what
it had seemed to be from surface appearances.
"It was the first battle fought solely within the bounds
of Virtual Reality."
"It represented the true nadir point in history when the
battle between the Forces of Light and the Forces of Darkness
moved beyond the physical plane and into the minds of mankind."
"InfoWar!" he roared, the word
reverberated throughout the room, sending the Trei Transponder
into a soft hum which grew louder and louder, with a pitch that
went lower and lower until it became subsonic, unheard, but shaking
the room...the earth...even WebWorld itself...
The Trei Transponder exploded with a mighty boom, shaking the
room so violently that the tattered remnants of the Magic Circle
were thrown from their chairs,  and found themselves rising to
see only ruins around them, where their safe house had once been.
They immediately realized that they must flee at once, as those
investigating the explosion would undoubtedly be the Dark Allies,
fully aware that the event had rent WebWorld at the seams.
Jonathan paused, weapon in hand, covering the retreat of d'Shauneaux,
who had remained behind to remove the last traces of evidence
that the Circle of Eunuchs had ever truly been there.
As d'Shauneaux joined him, motioning for him to proceed, he took
one last look at the shattered remains of the Trei Transponder.
All contact with the CypherPunks of the past was now gone, with
little hope of it being renewed.
Silently, he sent a message to the CypherPunks of his youth-from
the bottom of his soul and into the inestimable profundity of
the Tao. It was a message that would be understood by those who
had been at Woodstock-a physical gathering of a Magic Circle which
had come into physical being through a random blessing of Time
and Chance.
"You're on you own, folks...because we're sure on ours."
Those who fail to learn from the future, are doomed
to repeat it.
