~Isn't this amazing?  I've cut down the newsgroups to just misc.invest.
The article is discussing a recent forgery.  Maybe since the summer is over
and its back-to-work time he has to cut back to one group?  He-he-he-huh-huh.

@_subject: Re: HTTP authentication efforts 
Cern probably has this already done and under wraps by now.  In the
USA the recent NCSA/Spyglass, Inc press release implies that Spyglass
will develop an "electronic commerce" capability for Mosaic.
Tuesday's Wall Street Journal has an interesting article (Sep 20 C1 bottom)
about the mysterious DE Shaw company.  For those of you who don't follow
every vital scrap of information pryed out of DE Shaw - they are a stock
market related firm with very heavy investment in computer hardware and
brain power.
The article quotes Shaw implying the development of yet another electronic
market capability - "commercial use of the Internet".
Perhaps Shaw is funding some of Spyglass?  Its odd to see program trading gurus get side tracked on this.

@_subject: re: real time surveillances 
Some thoughts on this:
Will the people *believe* the electronic position data?   Nope.
When you are busted not only will you be frisked but you will also be
bulk erased :-)  (to get TC's DAT tape!)
The technology to fabricate video evidence is there is it not?
There was a relatively recent sad case of two officers that had a video
camera installed in their patrol car.  They had pulled over a speeding car.
While obtaining the license the occupants of the car murdered the policemen
and the *entire* scene was obtained on video tape.
When the tape was later reviewed, searching for a clue as to what happened,
the individual had to watch the officers slowly die - all captured on video.
It is possible that they might have been saved had this been real-time video
rather than taped.
Consider the next level here folks?  Will just having archived knowledge of
where certain people are be adequate?  Will there not ultimately be a call
for real time monitoring of these officers?  Will that be something that would
be cool with them?  Another great idea would be anonymous real-time monitoring of vital signs
along with position data.  Auto-911 if you will.  We know somebody at this corner had a heart attack 5 minutes ago where is he?

I haven't seen this on the cypherpunk list so I thought I would forward it
as an FYI.  Interesting that source code is available!
Have Fun!

@_subject: NSA crypto museum article 
The November 1995 issue of 'Popular Communications' magazine has a nice article
on the NSA Cryptologic Museum.  Included are maps and pictures and stuff.
Don Schimmel wrote the article.
I'm relocating to Herndon at the end of the month so I'll have a chance to
run by there.

@_subject: Re: a new idea: stocks == currency 
There was a book written some time ago called "SuperMoney" that basically
argues this point (that stocks were not only money, they were *better*
than money).
One example would be a deposit at a bank.  How can you tell if there is a
potential solvency problem at the bank?  One quick and easy check is to
look at the value of the stock of the bank!
You see this behavior in currencies when you are exchanging a stronger one
for a weaker one or vice versa :-)
PS: I read Prechter's "turn of the tidal wave" book over the holidays, and
although it is mostly dry, it is an interesting read.

I was starting to feel as if Java was going to be everything the hype was
cracking it up to be.
Then I saw Micro$oft jump on the Java bandwagon.  Could Java already be dead?

@_subject: Netcom censoring alt.* ? 
I don't think thats the case.  I'm the senior admin at the Dallas backup
site for Netcom.  I'm setting up several backup news servers here and we
aren't doing any alt.* censorship.  "alt" groups are still sucking up lots
of bandwidth and gigs :-).
On the other hand the San Jose site has had a lot of power problems and
news software problems to contend with lately (hence the idea of a "backup"
site for netcom :-) )   Maybe you are branching to a conclusion?
Now if there was only a way to tie the scientology thing in with the alt.*
censorship conspiracy.
