You guys OBVIOUSLY confuse reality with cyberspace.  Grafitti is actual
property damage.  A message in an EmailBox is long, long way from
being comparable.  Let's make use of that "education" that seems to make you so proud.

Does this maillist filter out messages from NON-subscribers?
This is an absurd and inaccurate analogy. The mailBot simply pushes
*mailto:* tags that people have willingly placed on their public websites.
They invite the mail so a more accurate analogy would be that City Hall puts
up a public suggestion box and invites comments. The bot then puts one, and
only one, unsigned anonymous suggestion into the box. It then goes on to the
Art Gallery where they too have put up a public suggestion box, and the bot
places one, and only one, anonymous suggestion in that box also...and it
moves on to the next publicly accessable suggestion box that it finds, each
time putting in one, and only one, message.
Can the College-aged mind these days not develop a rational, concise,
accurate and logical analogy that stays on point?
Think about it... or take down the public suggestion boxes if one doesn't
like what one finds inside. If you invite feedback...it will come.
There is

Like hell we're not.  What are you guys mad at us for?  Thinking that
FREEDOM of SPEECH is much, much more important that whining computer
nerds who can't push a DELETE button.
In that case, maybe you should learn to use the SHIFT key.  Or didn't
debaters in your school take typing and/or learn about punctuation,
capitalization, and the other niceties of English communication?
Well, "doctor" why can't you see (with your logic) that junk Email (or
"spam") would save many, many forests if it REPLACED junk SnailMail.
Isn't it just that your "irrelevant feelings" have been hurt, because
someone used your remailer-baby in a way you hadn't planned for ?!?
Why not put your money where your mouth is, and bet me (any amount),
that spam WILL be socially acceptable by the year 2000.  Particularly,
when the green-folks discover how many trees will be saved.  It'll be
a social-mandate, NOT just a suggestion.  Want to bet?

Let's hear it for common sense.  It's the first decent posting I've
seen to this list.

100 dead skunks in exchange for ONE is exactly what this discussion
is all about.  You CypherWIMPS just love over-kill.  EmailRobot sent
ONE message to EACH address.  Are you guys so unskilled in arithmetic
to understand the difference between 1 and 100?
One message is NOT spam, 100 messages to a single box IS spamming.

A message sent to a MAILTO button on a WebPage, which contains the URL of another WebPage is EXACTLY on-topic.  It's my belief that any active "webmistress" would be interested in what other sites have to offer.

Here's a collection of your various threats:
In making these threats, you've mistaken me for someone who cares.
Someone who cares what you send to my box.  I'm actually, and in fact,
homeless in real life.  Yes, both an "idiot" and a "simple fool":
your compliments in my book.  My only equipment is access to friends' computers, and a free dialup that the big-hearted SysOp at V-Site gives
me.  (By the way, you've been merciless to him).
In view of this fact:  Do you think that even 1,000,000 messages into my stupid electronic mailbox would matter?  Some nights my worries are
of a place to sleep, not how many messages will accumulate during my CypherPunks live so far from real-life, that it's impossible for them
to communicate rationally.  Never having any danger in their lives,
they want to avoid encountering any in "cyberspace".  They are trying to craft that new world according to their intellectual guidelines.
Trying to make sure real-world annoyances have been removed. This is what HipCrime's real offense was:  providing a piece of unexpected (ok,ok "unwanted", if you prefer) stimulus.  Only a single one.  A tiny-little URL, but sent without warning, anonymously, and pointing to a strange site.
Since I've UNSUBSCRIBED from your CypherWimps mailing list, and still
receive your messages (two copies, the one you send me, and the one
you send the list), my only conclusion is that Email is your only
social discourse.  Take notice that after this, all future messages
from y'all will feel the power of the DELETE button (unread and barely
noticed).  Think of how easy it is to move around in "cyberspace".  Do this math:  In this argument you win, junk Email is SPAM ... but junk SnailMail is

JMR, it's hard to believe that your English education is SO LACKING,
that you missed the fact, that in my sentence quoted above, the word "ours" refers to MANKIND IN GENERAL, not me personally.
Go sit in the corner with the duncecap on, and don't come out until you
can read an 8th grade piece of literature (with full comprehension).

We just disagree, nobody's WRONG here.  CypherWimps need, more than anything else, to get down off their
high-horses for once.
CyberSpace ain't Reality .  The reverse is true as well.
