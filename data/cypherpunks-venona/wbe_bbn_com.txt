@_subject: Figuring out ZyXEL's CELP specs 
After various people expressed interest in the ZyXEL modem CELP specs...

   OK.  In that case, it's up to us to figure it out.  :-)  I saw the
following post about 4800 CELP on another newsgroup and thought it might help
someone here get closer to figuring out how ZyXEL's 9600 CELP works.
PLEASE: the following message mentions a source of CELP source code that's
  (1) If you live in the D.C. area, maybe go ahead and call anyway and then
      post the results in this newsgroup.
  (2) If you have a high interest and it's likely you'll actually do
      something with the information, POST A NOTE TO THIS NEWSGROUP saying
      so and wait a couple of days so we can all see who else is interested.
  (3) When the dust settles, the most interested, and/or those nearest
      Washington, D.C., call to get the source code and then post it to the
      newsgroup (if permitted).  (Unfortunately, you may have to consider
      U.S. export restrictions, but since the author says the code "is
      available for worldwide distribution", I don't expect this to be a
      problem.)
