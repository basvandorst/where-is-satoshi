The thing  I'd like to understand about Cybercash is... how do I get the
cash back out of the system?

Nothing, but nothing in there restricts you from doing anything you like
with the software, as long as you provide attributation.
Maybe they don't like the terms of the gpl?  Maybe they don't want
to restrict *you* to having to give it away?  (And before you jump
my ass for being anti-gnu, go check the various GNU sources for work
I've submitted in the past.)
Is this where we point out that it was Young Master Blaze who pointed out the
technical failure in Clipper?

With all of the discussion of C&W, and potential expansion, along with
a sideband discussion of same, I decided to ask 'the man' himself.
The '10K email file' used in the example came from the sideband discussion.
Forwarded for your edification.

 Subject: Chaffing question
 Suppose you can start with a 10KB email file.
 Running a package (all-or-nothing) transform on it adds only a small
 amount to the length---say 128 bits total, or less (basically the length
 of a key in your favorite algorithm).
 You can break the result into 128 one-bit blocks and one 10KB block.  MAC
 each block.
 Add 128 bits of chaff, intermingled with the first 128 blocks from above.
 The final result has 128+128+1 packets, and total length 10KB (the
 original email) + 257*64 bits (for the 257 64-bit MAC values) plus 128
 bits (the chaff bits), and assuming that the sequence numbers are
 implicit rather than explicit, you get a total of around 12.3 KB.   ------- End of forwarded message -------
