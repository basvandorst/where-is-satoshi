Which it does...  FWIW, I tend to agree with your general point, but I
moved from downtown Manhattan to Harlem recently, and was surprised to see
how many foodstuffs cost _more_ up here, as well as the obvious fact that
many are harder to get...  Junk food and cheap liquor are everywhere,
Which doesn't say that a centralized food distribution system would be a win, but don't bet on privatization being a win either.  Many of the local
stores won't even hire in the neighborhood...
Of course, with big supermarket chains finally breaking into this island,
that is becoming less of an issue, so maybe things will balance.  Looking around me, I'm not inclined to bet on it, tho.

I would hardly classify alphabet city as a `low-crime suburban locale'.
Much more of an issue is that the locals downtown are much closer to being
within walking distance of the higher-rent higher-income areas, so the
local bodegas must keep prices low to compete.  Up here, it's a lot
farther to an alternative, and a lot fewer people have cars, so you have a
lot fewer choices.  The result is that what choices there are can pretty
much stock what they please and charge what they please...
The issue here is much more one of the insularity of the ghetto than it's
crime rate...

These days City College has a miniature version of CU's higher-rent bubble
effect.  At any rate within a few blocks of either school is rather a bit
better off than the surrounding areas.  111th is much more within CU's
sphere of influence, and prices at markets like Westside and UFM drop as
they compete for the student crowd.  That neighborhood has a pocket of
slightly more variety as well, for the same reasons.  As you walk north,
the number of liquor stores rises even as the number of businesses

Actually, at the risk of interrupting your little diatribe, the average
welfare recipient is on the dole for under 4 months.  While we're on the
subject, I may as well point out that the average welfare recipiant is also
white, lives in a lower-middle class suburban neighborhood, and has two or
fewer children, but you'd never know it from watching the pols...
At any rate, as I mentioned in my last post, you and I are paying three times
as much to corporate welfare as to personal welfare...

Actually, the US has one of the lowest tax rates in the world, and far
less of your tax money goes to welfare (or foreign aid, or disaster relief,
etc.) than in any other industrialized nation...
Yes, your taxes do go to those who are producing nothing, namely a bunch of
CEOs and wealthy shareholders
Or welfare payments of up to $500 million at a shot, if you happen to be GE, or
General Motors...
You keep using that word...  I do not think it means what you think it means...
The only examples of large-scale socialism we have are in extremely statist
environemnts.  Statism is brutal and innefficient no matter what economic
system it pays lip service to.

No.  Some systems are based on coercion, some are based on freedom.  This is a
completely different issue from whether a system is based on sharing or
hoarding...  As several people have been trying to explain to you, there are
really _two_ axes at work here.  (Something, for all my differences with its
authors, the `Libertarian Test' shows quite well)  One the one hand, some ssytems
are statist while others are anarchistic/librtarian.  On the other hand, some
systems are based on individual ownership, while others are based on communal
cooperation.  These axes are completely independent.
In a statist system, it doesn't matter whether you call yourself a `socialism' or
a `capitalism' -- the state can only preserve itself through theft and brutality.
On the other hand, in a free system, you would have the option of pursuing
capitalism, hoarding goods to trade with those of similar beliefs, while those who,
as myself, believe that more can be accomplished by pooling efforts and resources
would be free to work toward such a community.  Surely you do not find socialism
so frightening that you would deny us the right to seek it _for_ourselves_...
Because it is a gross oversimplification based on a misunderstanding of the basic
issues at stake...

Actually, I think this is a very valid implication.  One of the main ways
in which statist societies justify their restrictions on individuals is by
reifying large bodies of individuals and giving them their own rights and
responsibilities _as_a_seperate_entity_.  To speak of a mass of individuals,
whether you call it a corporation, a collective, or a government, as having
a different set of rights than the individuals who make it up, is the
heart of statism.
Exactly.  Like most, I have a strongly visceral negative reaction to bigotry.
I wish there could be a system of law which contained it.  There cannot, or
at least not without doing even more harm.
What will contain bigotry is education and example which inculcate this same
visceral response to the destructiveness of bigotry.  Unfortunately, statist
systems (and IMHO especially those of a cpaitalist nature) thrive on turning
subsets of society against each other, so that the populace are to busy to
turn against the state.

I would go further than this, though.  I would say that that mode of thought which considers an organization to _be_ an individual, with
rights and responsibilities of its own, is the hallmark of a state.
(_all_ states are totalitarian to some degree, that is what makes them
states).  That is to say, when we say "General Electric owns so and so
many dollars in assets" or "The government has a duty to protect its
citizens", we are accepting the basic precept of statism, that these groups
should be treated as something other than the sum of the individuals
whom they are made up of.
That's the point I was trying to make.  We cannot outlaw `bigotry'
because any such law would be a basic violation of the rights of
thought, and expression.  What we should do is combat the ignorance and
factionalism which make it possible.  As I said, the main obstacle
to doing away with bigotry is the fact that modern statist societies
rely on alienating the masses against themselves to keep prevent
popular insurrection.

It would probably be chased down under the `financing foreign crypto'
And here we have the heart of the regulations...  Only _actually_ close
what they're sure they can get away with, but make sure to make it
seem that the rules are logical and complete, so people will refrain
from exporting crypto legally or illegally for fear that they will
break the law without meaning too...
