@_subject: PGP commercial usage 
I have read and reread the documentation that is included with the PGP distribution (although my copy is over a year old now), and am still trying to work out if commercial use of 2.6ui is allowed outside the USA.
Could someone elaborate for me, or perhaps point me to some up to date reference documentation.
TIA - Dave.

@_subject: Psion organisers 
I was wondering about a couple of things regarding the Psion Series 3a personal organisers.  (According to the manual, you have them in the USA as well! :)
Firstly, anyone know what kind of encryption is done on documents and spreadsheets held on it's internal disk?   It only allows a 10 character password, and claims to encrypt the whole file.
Secondly, I presume that as the encryption software is apparently embedded into the system (ie cannot be extracted), I won't get arrested when I wander through US customs next time.
TIA - Dave.
