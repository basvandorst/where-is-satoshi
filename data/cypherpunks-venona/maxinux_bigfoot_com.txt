No horror stories of bestcrypt, but I hear that PGPdisk is damn dope,
except for two things.  The crypto 'file/partition/whatever' is static in
size, not dynamic, and it does _not_ use your pgp key.. But it looks like
it should still be neat.. I still like CFS for  linux :-)

I dont quite understand your question, but in PGP 6.0, they will use
pictures aswell.. It is all fakeable.. but verify all info somehow verify
key-id, fingerprint, picture etc.

@_subject: Re: network associates back in kra 
Well, They were automagically put back on the list when NAI bought TIS,
this has no baring on PGP at all.  Source code is in stores, and being
scanned as we speak, the PGP developers would not let them initiate any
KRAP stuff with pgp, they value there dignity and integrity.

@_subject: Power Outage in San Fransisco/bay area 
Well, we are going on hour 4 now, most of the power is back.  One group of
2-4 employees caused it they say.  This was admitted 3 hours later, and
then they knew 15 minutes after it happens.. typical.  They expect to be
back on by this afternoon
On the Shell Building at 8:30AM
"Building closed, no power.  Power will not be restored for 6-8 hours."
I wonder how they knew.  The estimate is probably about right too, wierd.
The mission village sub-station has been re-oppened, and most peoples
power is now being revived.  Funny how 2-4 people not following procedure
were able to shut down 4 substations.  Looks like PG&E have lots of work
ahead to find out the cause/effect of this type action.

Chief cleans house after half the Department makes fun of him via email on
Patrol Car Computer Terminals (PDC's)... (Plus it's a rally cool website - listen to police scanners while you read
FBI FOIA files on people like Frank Sinatra).
OAKLAND, N.J. (APB) -- Half of this small borough's police force may be
suspended for allegedly using computer terminals in their patrol cars to
send one another disrespectful comments about the chief and the borough.
