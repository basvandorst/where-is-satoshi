Dear 'Uncle Rob',
  I don't know what kind of sick pervert you are, but I have contacted
my service provider, and they are contacting 'your' service provider,
as well as the FBI and the FCC.
  Don't bother replying to this email, as my service provider is
all of your mailings, forthwith, to this service.  They will be seeing
to it that filth purveyors such as yourself are banished from the WWW.
You Sick Bastard,

Dear 'Sunshine', or 'Yvonne', or whatever your name is,
  I really don't think this is the kind of thing that belongs on
the InterNet.
  I have now seen this posting of yours in three different
conferences, and it is causing quite an uproar.  I think you may
need some kind of professional help.  Please stop posting these
sick messages in the conferences.
  Don't bother replying to this email, because my service provider
has blocked any further postings from you, and has contacted 'your'
service provider and the authorities about your postings.
Please, Get Help,

Dear Fuji4,
  It seems that I can't cruise a conference anywhere, without
seeing the above message emblazoned everywhere.
  Thanks to your efforts, I am sure that your service provider,
netcom.com, will gain much recognition for their new ethnic
cleansing policy.
  I am sure that they will be very thankful to you for your
efforts on getting the word out on their behalf.
