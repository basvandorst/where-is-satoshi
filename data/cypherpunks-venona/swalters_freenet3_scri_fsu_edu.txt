Not to mention all of the repeating- non-ending games
p.s. i wonder if there is a "irrational" game....one that goes on to infinity but never repeats itself.....I would imagine not as there are only a finite number of possibilities for peices to exist on the board
it was an interesting thought whie it lasted....

I have recieved a lot of personal mail stating that the game is a draw if such and such happens....i was ignoring this when i wrote the post....it takes all the fun out of thinking about the problem...
p.s. I'm also referring to perfectly logical entities playing who aren't out to win the game...just play and play and play and aplay and play and aplay ......
