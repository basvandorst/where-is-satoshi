I was thinking about this the other day and wondered if it wouldn't be
cheap and relatively easy to build a board that samples and sums
several randomly selected signals on various frequencies on the AM
broadcast spectrum.  This should catch stations in nearly all
metropolitan (and most rural areas as well) and would require that
someone be able to broadcast at multiple frequencies to "cheat" it.
Perhaps this would be affected by RF interference from the motherboard
itself.  If so, could the RF radiation from the motherboard itself be
used to generate random numbers?

Yes, I've noticed these as well.  One troubling thing I noted with one
such spam-handed "attack" was the use of a group of internal email
addresses (in the sense that we don't advertise these addresses) as
addressees for a message that had an analog sent to www-buyinfo and
some other web related addresses.  This seems to indicate a way of
organizing lists into sets based on location/topic, but doesn't
include all other potential addressees in the same domain or
I guess it was only a matter of time before someone wrote
sophisticated spamming servers that somehow capture/analyze log files,
or is this just some idiot front end that lets ad-happy fools spam
with a smaller apparent footprint?
By the way... One reply I got from an ISP re: one of these drive by
spammings indicated that they were charging the idiot for disobeying
policy.  I've started suggesting to ISPs that they dis-user and charge
the offender (in case they haven't thought of this yet).  If non-spam
policies were more widely used, and these idiots loose their
email/access and a few hundred dollars in charges for wasting ISP
admin time, perhaps this trend won't continue.
