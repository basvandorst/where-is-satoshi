I suspect this will unfortunately help. Stockholders are interested in profits, not principles. Co-oping with the feds will help Netscape get to the commercial market sooner, and most customers, sadly don't give a damn about privacy (or don't understand).

@_subject: Is ths legal?... 
I was told today that students at Oklahoma University have their computer
accounts subject to administrative inspection and that encryption (even
email) without escrow is prohibited. Maybe the story is not quite straight
but federal law supposedly protects personal electronic communication and
I somehow don't think OU can overide this simply because it passes thru
their computers. Sounds like another job for PGP.

Think about this principle in light of the current political climate
toward "privatization." Moves to privatize schools, prisons, even police
forces in a few communities. Sounds like a good way around all those
 constitutional protections. It seems to me that there is some legal status to email established by Congress in the late '80s, especially that which comes in from outside with 'some expectation' of privacy. I've got to rummage around for the details however.

This is the reference I couldn't find for my previous post. It would seem to have some relevance here
 Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA) (18 U.S.C. ss 2510
et seq.).  "It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for an operator of
a switchboard, or an officer, employee, or agent of a provider of wire *or
electronic* communication service, whose facilities are used in the trans-
mission of a wire communication, to intercept, disclose, or use that
communication in the normal course of his employment while engaged in any
activity which is a necessary incident to the rendition of his service or
to the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that
service, except that a provider of wire communication service to the
public shall not utilize service observing or random monitoring except for
mechanical or service quality control checks."  18 USC section
2510(2)(a)(i). Doesn't seem to leave much room for snooping on contents of messages. Jay Holovacs PGP Key fingerprint =  AC 29 C8 7A E4 2D 07 27  AE CA 99 4A F6 59 87 90  (KEY id 1024/80E4AA05) email me for key

The provider is allowed access ONLY for QC purposes. Getting back to thhe original point, the provider's ability to interpret the contents of the message is in no way required to monitor the system and cannot be used as a justification in itself for prohibiting use of crypto. Also, what if someone outside the system emails encrypted messages to the user. What authority would the sys admin have there??

This has somewhat undemocratic aspects when applied to political free speech. A person has ONE vote regardless of his wealth and as far as access to the political process this same principle must be maintained otherwise democracy is lost. At times freedoms for corporate entities and freedoms for individuals are at cross purposes, freedom for individuals must always be held in the higher position.

One potential "clean room" solution would be to publish precise interface specifications for the product. Overseas vendors and users could produce their own patches that match the interface. This is of course a kind of "hook", and the gov may sabre-rattle about it but I doubt it will stand up in court. Certainly publishing specs is no different than publishing "Applied Cryptography".

@_subject: Crypto on private files 
In a brief NPR report on the Leary case (he is alleged to have firebombed the NYC subway) there is a decision due on whether prosecutors can force him to give up passwords for his personal computer files (he was a computer professional). His attorney is claiming 5th amendment privilige.
According to the newscaster, the NY state court decision should be a first in this type of case. Prosecutors argue it is no different from
being forced to turn over a diary.
The report does not say what type of protection was used.

I might suppose that a significant reason why the nuclear arms race did not come to blows was the balance of espionage between NSA/CIA/KGB etc. With accurate information on your enemy, one is less likely to be panicked into a preemtive strike.

This is a significant area of research, and is not that well understood.

Face recognition is much tougher than it would seem.

@_subject: Re: math patents 
This falls into the same category as software patents. According to an ATT
patent attorney, the ALGORITHM is not patented, however building a virtual
machine to implement it is covered by the patent. This is the same as
chemical processes which have been patented historically, you use public
domain chemicals, and normal laboratory procedures in appropriate
sequence, apply an algorithm to create something new. The patent covers
use of this process (algorithm). As such it is not new. Crypto is a very TINY part of the picture. General software patents (where the big money is) had been submitted for years, and these financial considerations apparently drove the picture.
Not that this makes much sense, but then the whole concept of intellectual property law is littered with absurdities.
