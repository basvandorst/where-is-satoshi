While creating a 2.6-like version from 2.3a seems a worthy goal, this
supporting argument is flawed.  The original PGP was written in the USA
and, never having received the proper export approvals, must have been
"illegally exported."   Isn't Phil Zimmerman being "investigated" by a
grand jury for this even now?  So, it would seem to me that a bulletin
board carrying any version of PGP holds illegally exported software (wrt
US law).  How does 2.3a differ from 2.6 in this respect?

There is an additional difference which I believe has been implicit in
most of the discussion on this issue:  When we talk about a company
escrowing the keys of its employees, we mean the company escrows the keys
of encrypted communications used *for company business and on "company
time"*, not necessarily all keys utilized for all communications by the
employees.  I suppose a company could try to restrict its employees further,
but as Blanc notes, you can leave the company a lot easier than you can

I think I now understand what it is you're saying.  But the protocol you
describe is merely that of a trusted escrow agent, which is not a Governments can sometimes act in that capacity (for example, if you
default on your mortgage, the govt. will hand over your house to the
mortgage holder).   One difference between the government and other
trusted "adjudicators" is that -- and this goes back to an earlier idea
in this thread -- the government has the force of arms to back up its
decisions.  (If you don't make your monthly payment, the bank goes to
the adjudicator [the govt.] who turns over the property to the bank and
evicts you.  If you refuse to leave, the govt. sends men with guns to
your house to force you out.)  Any other agent would need to have some
economic or other pressure it could apply to you to compel you to follow
the "rules" you agreed to.
Without the threat of force, though, this can hardly be called a government.
You're simply taking an existing concept -- that of a trusted adjudicator,
which need have no connection with a government -- and calling it
"government".  This doesn't make it so.  I am reminded of this [Lewis
Carroll?] quote Steve Bellovin posted several months ago:
  ``When *I* use a word,'' Humpty Dumpy said, in rather a scornful tone,
  ``it means just what I choose it to mean---neither more nor less.''
This whole scheme rests on the willingness of relatively large groups to
put themselves under the control and protection of this cyberspace "government" in the first place.  I still don't see what the motivation
will be.  What advantage to me will there be in allying myself with this
government, when I could instead choose a particular trusted arbitrator
or adjudicator or escrow agent on a case-by-case basis when and if it's
needed?  How will one of these governments ever acquire the critical mass
necessary to make anyone care what their rules are?
And the question of motivation is central to your conclusion, which was:

@_subject: Re: THOSE DARNED HIT MEN 
Good points, Sandy.  However... (student dunce cap stapled firmly to
my head [ouch])
First of all, it's not clear to me that it is impossible to structure
the deal so that your escrow service even knows that it is a murder
contract.  It might be possible to construct it as "I authorize you to
pay the other party if they can produce a certificate that, when
decrypted with this key, produces this text."  The production of that
certificate might only be accomplished through the cooperation of the
on-line coroner -- see scenario two below.
Why can't I damage your reputation?  Assuming:
a)	there exists a public place to cast aspersions on your business
b)	that I have a receipt digitally signed by you indicating that
c)	that I can prove I have "executed" my end of the bargain
How will you defend yourself?  I'll simply challenge you to produce
the receipt (signed by me) proving that I received the payment from
you, which - obviously - you won't be able to do.  Your only recourse
is to ignore me and hope that no one else listens to me (might work
once but ...).  I don't see why the subject of the contract would
ever come up.
(And surely, you wouldn't try to argue that you didn't pay me simply
because the contract was for murder -- I don't think your potential
future clients would relish giving their escrow service the power to
judge the moral virtue of their contracts.)
Here's the real problem:
How can I (as the hypothetical murderer) prove to the satisfaction of
the hiring party and the escrow service that I have fulfilled my part
of the contract?
It seems that, in order for this scheme to work, the coroner must be
in the business of regularly publishing signed and certified death
certificates on the net.  Otherwise, a premise of the whole scenario
(that there is a way for me [the killer] to prove that I have done
the deed) is not fulfilled and we would never have made our "anonymous"
contract in the first place.
So, the coroner (the death-certifying agent) is in a position of
considerable trust.  And after all, "Murder Escrows R Us" is not the
only company making use of the coroner's death certificates; Net Life
Assurance Corporation ("Get Net, it pays" :-) will also base its
(potentially quite-large) payoffs on the certificates issued by the
coroner.  I'm assuming therefore that the life insurance companies and
the like will exert sufficiently strong influence to ensure that your
scenario is extremely unlikely.  Perhaps the CyberNation Association
of Life Insurance Companies has promised to hunt down and shoot like
a dog any coroner they find out has faked a death certificate.  Or,
perhaps you must put up a very large bond before you become established
as a coroner who is trusted to issue net-death certificates.
In either case, the problem boils down to this:
Everyone has their price; can I, as the hired killer, afford the coroner's
price?  I'm betting that the coroner's price is pretty damn high.
[The murder victim could presumably help with the bribe payment too, but
once you've told him about the murder plan, he can take steps to protect
himself from you and there will be little motivation for him to help.]
(Now how do I get this thing off my head ...)

@_subject: Re: End of HIT MEN thread 
I'm sorry that you're signing off this thread, particularly since
it was you that challenged others to "disprove" your scenarios.
After considerable struggle, I have finally succeeded in coming up with
a mechanism through which the hiring party and the murderer-for-hire
can make a contract through the escrow service in such a way that the
escrow service doesn't know that the contract is for murder.  Of course,
it requires some additional assumptions -- none of them outrageous IMO.
Since you have lost patience with the thread, I won't bother to post
the details.
This much I will say: I believe that *IF* there is a way to prove to
the satisfaction of an unbiased third party that the intended victim is
in fact dead [I'm not at all sure of this -- and this is where my
additional assumptions come in], *THEN* the contract can be structured
in such a way that the knowledge of the contract details are hidden
from the escrow service who's overseeing the performance of the contract.
So, in your scenario ONE, the escrow service would not know the contract
is a hit, and therefore would not cheat.  And, it would be completely
vulnerable to the accusation if it did so.
You say you are arguing the real world.  Yet you are proposing or discussing scenarios which are clearly not possible today.  So in some
sense, you are asking the rest of us to assume some set of future
conditions which are predicted to hold -- without any assurance that
they will.  I did in fact view this as a game which is why I felt free
to invent other pieces of infrastructure which didn't seem outrageously
You and Tim (and others) have argued over whether or to what extent an
ordinary escrow service will tolerate contracts for illegal and immoral
services.  My own opinion is closer to yours, but if, as I believe, the
knowledge of the contract details can be kept from the escrow service,
this all becomes academic anyway.  As you say, history will judge.
To me, it seems that the hard problem here is how (or whether) a real
world event, such as the death of an individual, could ever be "proved"
to an impartial observer via the net.  As you pointed out, digitized
images alone will not fill the bill, which is why I invented the on-line coroner's service.
Anyway, it was fun.

@_subject: Re: End of HIT MEN thread 
I admit, not a very good title with which to continue the thread.
I simply took it one step farther and did away with the need for
verification of a "hit" (of course it's replaced by a step which verifies the "death" but does not require that it appear to be a hit).
I did this by assuming into existence an on-line coroner's "clearinghouse"
to which ALL the coroners belong and to which all death certificates
are filed.  This way, no one other than the killer and the hiring party
need ever know that a hit has taken place.
If the clearinghouse provides an automated e-mail server (or functional
equivalent) which will answer the question "Is dead?" with a response message in a standard format and encrypted
with a key provided in the request, then the killer and the employer
can cooperate in the creation of a request packet and an "expected
response" packet.  In my scheme, another trusted agent is required
during the setup phase -- his only function is to ensure that the
employer doesn't cheat in the preparation of these packets.
Then, the employer simply gives the encrypted expected response packet
to the escrow service with instructions to pay the killer when he
can produce a copy of the packet.  The killer will only be able
to obtain this when the coroner's clearinghouse responds to a query
with the "victim is dead" response encrypted in the key prepared by
the employer.  This key is known only by the employer but was also used
in the preparation of the expected response packet.
So, the steps are:
1	Employer creates a key P (which he does *NOT* disclose to Killer).
2	The two now cooperate in a set of transactions with Trent using
3	First, Killer provides plaintext of the request, plaintext of
4	Then, Employer provides P, the plaintext of the expected response
5	Trent verifies that both copies of the plaintext of the expected
6	Now, Trent takes the plaintext of the request, appends P and
7	And, Trent takes the plaintext of the expected response, encrypts
8	Employer gives the encrypted expected-results packet (along with
9	After verifying that the escrow service has the money, and
10	Within a few days, the victim's death is is duly filed in the
11	The clearinghouse uses its private key to decrypt the request
12	Since the victim really is dead, the clearinghouse produces a
13	The clearinghouse returns the results to Killer who forwards a
14	The escrow service pays off -- end of contract.
Probably, this could be modified so that Trent doesn't need to see
the plaintext request and response, but I'd have to get out Schneier
and spend all night thinking about that.  Also, it doesn't seem that
important since the request and response are small snippets of text
that Trent operates on a hundred thousand times every day.  Furthermore,
all Trent can do is refuse to perform the transaction -- neither of
the parties to the contract will be out a dime if he won't.
Avoiding this is the primary reason I have the coroner's association.
In essence, all that is needed is a trusted source of information about
the real world.  It could just be an ordinary general purpose information
retrieval service, except that it has to know about deaths of particular
individuals and I don't see any route other than the on-line coroner
for the information to make it into "cyberspace".
OK, now that that's done with...
Unless goaded into another response, I too will shut up about this thread.

But you're advocating what are non-trivial measures in an attempt to solve
a problem which is not the easiest attack anyway.  You have been arguing
that it might be possible to download a new MD5, then modify it in unusual
ways to prevent hacking of the local compiler to recognize it.  Then,
when folks point out other ways to subvert your integrity check, you
complain that you're not trying to solve ALL the problems, only a certain
subset.  I think the subset you've selected is arbitrary and not
particularly realistic.
Let's face it, creating the compiler-to-recognize-MD5 is quite a difficult
problem, and if I were your system administrator and wanted to obtain
access to your files, creating a special compiler version or otherwise
attempting to cause your integrity check to fail would be one of the last
forms of attack I'd try.
I agree that would be useful.  But the problem with this whole argument
is that the number of things whose modification you need to detect is
large and their detection is non-trivial.  One of the easiest ways to
subvert your security is simply to record your keystrokes.  It doesn't
take a rocket scientist to hack your kernel (or whatever it's called on
your OS) to do this.  And how do you detect it?  The original kernel
can be restored after booting with a hacked kernel so you can't use
modification times.  Perhaps you can then detect that the system was
rebooted?  Well, maybe, but hiding that is not so difficult either,
and a reboot may not necessarily seem suspicious in any case.
The bottom line is that, as an ordinary user, you are relying completely
on your trust in the system administrator.

[ Oops -- this was supposed to go to the list too. ]
[ Note: I've rearranged a couple of paragraphs ]
This seems to be confusing different entities.  The roles in these
examples aren't the CA's role.  In the usual crypto lingo, the CA
only certifies that a key belongs to a certain individual.  Some
entity within the corporation is responsible for saying whether an
individual can do deals up to $1 million.  Some other organization
provides time-stamps (though it's possible that a CA could be dragged
into your second example).  But let's keep the terminology straight:
a CA as used in crypto literature means the agent who certifies that
"this key belongs to X" (for some definition of X).
This is a better example to start from.  I agree with your sentiment
but don't necessarily agree with the conclusion.  Let's start from
the important "if" in your sentence.  If the CA publicly guarantees
only that it checks for a certain ID and can prove it did this
(perhaps by producing a picture or photocopy of the ID it examined),
it shouldn't have too much trouble defending the case.  No reason why
it should need any special short-circuit.  Eventually, successful
defenses will show that it's a waste of time to attack the CA if
the CA did what it promised.
If it guarantees more (say, that "this key *really* belongs to 'X'"),
then it better be prepared to establish that fact to its own
satisfaction before issuing the certificate (via birth certificates,
passports, fingerprints, retinal scans or all of the above).  If it
fails to do those things, then it is and should be liable.  After
all, that's what the CA is getting paid for: to keep the promise
it's implicitly making and take the heat to back up its promise.
I think this is just part of the landscape for a CA.  Again, that's
what they're getting paid for.  As for the rules, the courts will work
those out through litigation.  How else?  :-)
BTW, VeriSign is acting as a CA now for Netscape Commerce Server and
Open Market Secure Web Server certificates, and perhaps others -- see:
I don't know exactly what guarantee VeriSign's making or what they
expect their liability to be, but they are making a reasonable effort
to establish the identity of server certificate holders (copy of letters
of incorporation, business licenses and so forth).  And they are charging
$290 for a first-year certificate.  It seems to me this $290 (though not huge for a business) is a lot more than it costs them just to
check the papers and execute the mechanics of creating the certificate.
The rest is their compensation for taking the "risk" of issuing the
certificate's implicit guarantee.  Presumably, some of that money goes
toward insuring themselves against the kinds of claims you cited above.
Just my thoughts -- IANAL.

I almost always agree with Tim.  This time I have to differ -- I think
his outrage at the course of the OJ trial has fogged his head.
Well, it's hard to see that from reading the rest of it.
I don't see any "surveillance state" issue.  Fuhrman openly agreed to
speak to the screenwriter.  AFAIK, he had no reason to believe the
screenwriter wouldn't tell anyone else.  Nor should he have counted on
that anyway.  Any loss of credibility (or other penalty) he receives
is entirely deserved, IMO.
If he didn't want his words coming back to "haunt" him, he shouldn't
have spoken them, in this setting at least, whether they were sincere
or merely an attempt to puff himself up in her eyes.  Speaking as a
"consultant" (or whatever he imagined his relationship with the
screenwriter to be) isn't the same as speaking in confidence to your
best friend in a private setting anyway.
I am not alarmed in the least (by this development, anyway).  There's
no evidence that Fuhrman's comments are being taken out of context.
Fuhrman freely entered into the arrangement wherein his comments were
recorded.  Let's face it, the most likely explanation here is that
Fuhrman is a lying scumbag.
The fact that Fuhrman may be a lying scumbag doesn't make OJ any less
guilty.  However, it does throw a lot of suspicion on Fuhrman's
testimony.  OJ's entire defense has been based on the claim that
Fuhrman and other LAPD members lied and otherwise conspired in order
to frame him.  These tapes are clearly appropriate to that defense
whether you believe the defense a valid one or not.
The fact that Fuhrman's comments are racist or sexist are not the
point.  What is important is that he lied in court about having made
those statements.  If he or the prosecution believes that a case can
be made that Fuhrman was just puffing himself up, then they should try
to convince the jury of that.
Yes, IMO, this is the important issue.  Anyone who dispenses racial
epithets with the ease he apparently displayed in the tapes is an
idiot to have made such a claim whether the tapes were puffery or not.
IANAL, but let me just say that if I were on the jury, I don't think
I'd believe a single word he'd said during the trial.  I think that
I would probably still believe him to be guilty, anyway, but it's hard
to be sure without having heard only what the jury has heard.
I don't know.  I'm kinda amazed that Ito has said that other portions
of his taped words won't be used, such as those parts where he describes
manufacturing evidence against the accused.  That seems to me to be
clearly relevant, at least as relevant as his use of the n-word.
Not me.  A few weeks there was a thread concerning the use of
information by private "reputation" bureaus.  I can't find the thread
in the archives but I seem to recall you defending the right of
private entities to keep and distribute such information (my apologies
if this was someone else).  Anyway, to me, these tapes fall clearly in
the same domain.  This screenwriter isn't a government agency, the
information was freely given, and the screenwriter has every right to
offer it for whatever purpose she deems appropriate, for free or
for money (barring any agreements to the contrary, of which I have
heard nothing).

-	Cylink maintains control of the Stanford patents (Hellman-Merkle,
-	RSA maintains control of the MIT patents (RSA [others])
-	It isn't clear to me whether Cylink maintained the right to use

This answer is evasive.  RSA didn't give the complete sentence from the

    "Therefore, after April 6, 1990, RSA has a right to license its
    (RSA's) software to third-parties but does not have the right to
    license such third-parties under the Stanford patents."
So, their answer appears to be correct only if the RSA software doesn't
infringe the Stanford patents.  And that seems to be a matter of opinion.
Furthermore, the next sentence in the order continues:
    "To the extent RSA provides code to third-parties which causes an     infringement of a valid and enforceable claim of the Stanford patents,
    assuming the third party is not separately licensed under the Stanford
    patent [sic], nothing in this order shall prevent Cylink from pursuing

It does not run CGI scripts (i.e. no forms support).  It does not have

conditional retrieval (i.e. "If-modified-since").  It is slow (requires
a separate process for each request).  It is initiated by inetd for each
HTTP connection and hence relies on that program's security as well (the
"line-by-line analysis" of inetd is conspicuously missing from Fred's
self-congratulatory whitepaper -- not to mention the OS on which it is

BTW, it would be helpful if you would provide some context when you complain or comment about another posting.  At the time I read your note,
it was the only cypherpunks note in my mailbox.  Perhaps I read some
message earlier from the ECafe anonymous mailer but if so, it certainly
wasn't remarkable enough to leave a lasting impression.
Finally, it should be noted that the kind of messages you're posting
lately are eerily reminiscent of Detweiler's mental deterioration just
before he went off the deep end.  In fact, the line "How long will the
cypherpunks put up with this?" may be an exact quote.

And flame hotly is the full extent of what can be done by "the cypherpunks".
The point I'm making is that "the cypherpunks" can't do anything about
anonymous posters or other such "problems".  It's pretty pointless to
ask the list how long "we" will "put up with" postings made by an anonymous
person.  There's nothing I nor any other J. Random Cypherpunk can do about
it, even if I/we wanted to (which I, at least, do not).  This is not at
all the same issue as whether a given post is on-topic or whether a
given opinion is cypherpunk-correct (not that there's much I can do
about those things either).
In any case, the only time most folks on this list get "upset" is
when someone on the list tries to say or imply that they represent
"the cypherpunks" or "the cypherpunk point of view".  Of course he/she
is free to do so anyway, but should expect to get "flamed hotly" if
someone disagrees.

So, I take it you have no problems with me as a private individual
selling information about you to the highest bidder so long as I don't
file letters of incorporation?  This is a silly distinction.
But more to the point: The word corporate does not necessarily denote a
huge company with millions of dollars in revenue, thousands of employees
and stock publicly traded on the NYSE.  Most "corporations" are small
companies, one or two or a few employees.  Every time the government-as-
nanny types come up with a new law "to protect us from the evil
corporations", every company big and small is saddled with additional
costs and hassles.  This means dollars to you and me, either directly --
because you're an owner or employee of the company -- or indirectly --
because the price of goods sold increases.  Why is this so hard to grasp?
Yes, it *IS* unreasonable as applied to information.  If you don't want
an individual or company to have information about you, don't give it
to them.  Pay cash for your purchases.  Or make them (contractually)
agree not to release the information.  Sure, it may cost you extra
dollars, and sometimes they may not be willing, so you'll have to take
your business elsewhere or live with the realization that you're trading
convenience (and other benefits) for privacy.

Padgett, you can't just throw out these pronouncements without supporting arguments.  Why would this be legal?  Merely because you say so?
Where would the US government get the authority to prohibit all PGP
communications?  If you still insist this is allowed by the "regulate
foreign commerce" clause of the US Constitution, you at least need
to describe how the USG would attempt to justify it to a court as
commerce.  Furthermore, since the foreign commerce clause is also the
inter-state commerce clause, explain why the government can't use the
same argument to prohibit us folks in Georgia from using PGP in our
communications with Californians (for example).  Or do you believe it can?

Well, I haven't exactly been "plugged in" to the development of the CC
but given the sheer size of the criteria (I just downloaded it, killing
a small tree to print its more than 1000 pages), I'm curious to know why
you think evaluations will be so much less expensive.
At first glance, some of the requirements seem a little more specific
and the evaluation process a bit more flexible, but evaluating an entire
OS, for example, is still going to take many man-years (excuse me,
person-years) of engineering labor.  And then, when you're done, still
nobody will want what you've got since it will inevitably be two releases
behind the "non-secure" version and you will have thrown out some pieces
where it was too much trouble to make them work "securely".
It appears to me that the main difference is that your system will be
unwanted in several different countries at once. :-)

AFAIK, none.  I don't see how this would be helpful anyway.  If you MD5 the password, I won't be able to snoop the password off the wire,
but I can simply snoop the MD5 hash off the wire instead and since that's what your authentication check must now be against, what does
this buy you?
Well, if you use SSL, it's useable by a "large number of browsers" since
Netscape has such a large share of the browser market.  And then all of
the things you're doing w.r.t. authentication are hidden, at least from
casual eavesdroppers and others too if you use more than the 40-bit option.
There's really no other choice to reach a large number of browsers.

@_subject: Re: WWW User authentication 
OK.  I suppose I deserved this -- I didn't make the leap from "MD5" to digest
access authentication.  I've studied up now.  Still, as you say, digest
authentication won't protect the password modification scenario.
This, on the other hand, was both uncalled-for and incorrect.  Netscape
browsers certainly do account for a large majority of the total browsers.
If a solution doesn't work with Netscape, most people would agree that it
isn't "useable by a large number of browsers".  And, in any case, Netscape
is not the only browser to implement SSL.  Several other commercial
browsers also claim to support SSL and I have even heard that there is a
version of Mosaic that uses SSLeay.
SHTTP might be better if it didn't have to be "useable by a large number
of browsers" -- since Netscape doesn't support SHTTP.  (I'm sorry that you
apparently find Netscape's success so frustrating, but it is a fact.)

Yes.  Netscape servers pass three (additional) environment variables to
CGI programs when used with SSL.  For a 40-bit invocation, you get:
    HTTPS=ON
    HTTPS_KEYSIZE=128
    HTTPS_SECRETKEYSIZE=40
So, you can distinguish 40- versus 128-bit usage.

[I told myself I was going to stay out of this, but Jim Bell's dogmatic
stance irks me... ]  Here's a citation from "Portability of C Programs
and the Unix System" by S.C. Johnson and D.M. Ritchie (yes, that Richie)
in the Bell System Technical Journal volume 57, Number 6, July-August 1978.
    "A representation of characters (bytes) must be provided with at
    least 8 bits per byte. ...  Most programs make no explicit use of
    this fact, but the I/O system uses it heavily.  (This tends to rule
    out one plausible representation of characters on the DEC PDP-10,
    which is able to access 5 7-bit characters in a 36-bit word with     one bit left over.  Fortunately, that machine can access four 9-bit
    characters equally well.) ..."
The clear implication is that "byte" means the number of bits used or
needed to represent a single character.

@_subject: Re: Protocols at the Point of a Gun 
That's not at all clear.  The IETF did not sit down in committee and
"develop IPv4" (thank god).  And I've not seen any evidence that it was
designed with support for security labels in mind.
Personally, I agree with Steve that, even though IP *may* be used to
propagate security options, it isn't the "right" place.
One problem with labeling things at the transport level is that this
requires support for the labels throughout the operating system(s) on
which the "content" is generated (at least for a "real" multi-user system
with a potentially mixed adult/child user base) or through which it flows.
The operating system has to carry labels around in conjunction with each
and every process and file on the system in order that the low-level
software will be able to accurately label IP datagrams.  And this OS
support is both difficult to implement and onerous to the users and
applications running on that platform -- otherwise, we'd all be running
on TCSEC B-level operating systems right now.
Fundamentally, the decision boils down to whether you want the labeling
to be mandatory (as with DoD security labels) or voluntary as with PICS.

IANAL, but I think you must be wrong about this, Perry.  If this were
the case then, as an employee of company XYZ, I would never be permitted
to buy XYZ stock (which is clearly not the case) since I *always* have
information that others outside the company do not (about staff changes,
product plans and such).  I suspect the deciding factor must have to do
with the ability to execute actions which have substantial direct effects
on the stock price (i.e. buying a company, declaring dividends, having a
massive downsizing, etc.).

I trust it won't stun you to find that many, many large and even small
corporations -- including my current employer [*NOT* SecureWare, BTW,
despite the email address] -- actually encourage their employees to buy
stock by offering stock purchase plans as a benefit of employment.  They
even make it convenient by deducting purchases from one's paycheck.
Presumably then, we ordinary employees are so in-the-dark that any
non-public information we do hold is considered non-material?
So perhaps Tim over-simplified by saying that there were no limits on
what ordinary employees could do.  OTOH, it seems that Perry also
over-simplified by flatly stating that Tim's trades while an Intel
employee were "illegal".

OK.  The only point I want to make is that thousands of us do this to
some extent every year and the risk apparently isn't terribly high.
Each person who works for a large corporation has *some* "non-public

stock purchase plan next year.  (Obviously if I think the company's
going to tank, I won't buy any more shares.)  I haven't seen anyone
attempt to define "material" but I'll concede that it's vague enough
to be dangerous to anyone whose trades are large enough to attract

I'm sort of a neophyte when it comes to digital cash, micropayments and

for discussing the problem.  How will you know the cost is .3c a priori?
What's to stop me from saying yes to the .3c and staying on the line
forever?  If you disallow that, how?  Will it cost the same amount if
I'm not sending anything as it will if I'm sending a live video + audio
feed?  If so, what's to stop me from bundling my whole neighborhood's
Internet traffic into this call?  If not, how will you tell the
difference without monitoring my usage and requiring me to pay for the
additional bandwidth I use?
Or are you saying that each IP packet will have an appropriately sized
digital cash payment attached?  That seems like too much overhead.
And besides, that contradicts your idea that the user would explicitly
approve each wallet access.
It gets even worse if you're an ISP, you obviously can't sit there
and approve each session that goes by (even if you could distinguish
higher level session boundaries which you won't be able to do).  Are
you just to assume at the end of the day that everything worked
perfectly and you received enough revenue to cover your costs without
knowing anything about the payment/usage profiles of any of your
customers?  And how is the ISP's network provider to know how much to
charge the ISP?
