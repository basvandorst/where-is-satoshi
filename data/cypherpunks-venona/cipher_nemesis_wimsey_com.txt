As long as you are aware of the risks and accept them.. no
problem.  But "I don't know if he'd think of this" is hardly
cryptographically secure..
Well no.. without the secret key file, you have to factor the
public modulus to find the secret key.   We all know how are
that is..  if he already has the encrypted key file though...
then he just has to guess your password.  Far less work, unless
of course you picked a pass phrase a few hundred letters long.
In general, it is impossible to achieve total security on a
multi-user system unless you are the sysadmin yourself.  You
either have to forget it entirely or decide what risks you're
willing to take and what risks you're not.
Good luck.

Well, I've played with stealth briefly, along with a few other
interesting utilities, and it does look good.  i.e. there is no
way to validate proper messages.  If you feed
noise/junk/whatever into stealth, it will give you a pgp encoded
message back.  Every picture posted to alt.binaries.pictures.*
could be run through stealth and a pgp file would result.  Find
which ones *really* were pgp files to begin with.. good luck..
What we have to worry about is making sure there is no way to
identify the data that pgp puts out itself.  That is, the
encrypted data and the encrypted IDEA key.  If I gave you random
samples of noise and told you that one of them was an IDEA key
encrypted by an RSA key, you shouldn't be able to pick it out.
