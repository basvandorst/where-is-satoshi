PLEASE NOTE: IANAL either [yet] But,
I agree, and this post has nothing to do with that controversy [I hope].
Good idea, but I have an idea to upset even *more* people.
First of all, has anyone else noticed how the Republicans have placed
life-and-death emphasis lately on the oft-ignored 10th Amendment.
Amendment X -- "The powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the
States respectively, or to the people."
IMO, the Republicans will continue to do this as long as they can win
the overwhelming majority of governorships, which is for the foreseeable
future. Democrats, of course, don't like this and prefer unconstrained
federal power [preferably in the hands of someone other than Newt, though].
There is, however, another Amendment which goes beyond being oft-ignored to the status of being truly forgotten, without ever having been repealed.
Amendment IX -- "The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights
shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."
[The right to write code was among many rights NOT enumerated.]
Republicans AND Democrats ALL HATE the 9th Amendment, which is the primary
reason *I* like it so much. Various lawyers, judges, and [especially]
law professors will sputter that the 9th is "impertinent!" or "irrelevant!" and should be ignored, and Jim Ray is just spouting off [again] about the
slow erosion of freedom in this country. My rejoinder is "OK, if we're
supposed to ignore it, why not just REPEAL it, after all, it's just sitting
there doing nothing, cluttering up the rest of the Bill of Rights." Usually,
conversation [and, I suspect, my eventual grade] degenerates at this point.
Those C-punks not in law school, however, should keep the 9th in mind when
talking about Constitutional issues on encryption rights, if for no other
reason than to educate the public. In court, of course, I would concentrate
on the 1st. Apologies to the various lurking law professors on the list, I
am not talking about you. Also, this diatribe is mere academic speculation
and not a legal opinion and IANAL and I have been known to be wrong in the
past and I no-doubt will be wrong again in the future and most people in the legal profession think this is wrong so don't rely on it and your lawyer
will think you are crazy if you say this to him (so don't) and so on and
so on...

True, and from what I hear, I regret not taking it. A distinction my feeble mind fails to grasp, as doing the one is required
in order to even make the other possible. [Now all can see why I had so much trouble in law school.]
A short trip to:"CME's cryptography timeline" [Recently suggested on this list] and found at URL:
  Reveals some interesting code-history.
[In case the good professor or others on the list are without a
SLIP/PPP connection, a not-so-short excerpt from CME's cryptography
timeline follows]:
- - From David Kahn's ``The Codebreakers'':      ``It must be that as soon as a culture has reached a certain level,
probably measured largely by its literacy, cryptography appears
spontaneously -- as its parents, language and writing, probably also did. The multiple human needs and desires that demand privacy among two or more people in the midst of social life must inevitably lead to
cryptology wherever men thrive and wherever they write. Cultural diffusion seems a less likely explanation for its occurrence in so many
areas, many of them distant and isolated.'' [p. 84] The invention of cryptography is not limited to either civilians or the government. Wherever the need for secrecy is felt, the invention occurs. However, over time the quality of the best available system continues to improve and those best systems were often invented by civilians.
Again, from David Kahn:      ``It was the amateurs of cryptology who created the species. The professionals, who almost certainly surpassed them in cryptanalytic expertise, concentrated on down-to-earth problems of the systems that were then in use but are now outdated.
     The amateurs, unfettered to those realities, soared into the empyrean of theory.'' [pp. 125-6] In the list to follow (until I learn how to make tables in HTML), each
description starts with (date; civ or govt; source). Sources are identified in full at the end.       about 1900 BC; civ; Kahn p.71; an Egyptian scribe used non-standard hieroglyphs in an inscription. Kahn lists this as the first documented example of written cryptography.       1500 BC; civ; Kahn p.75; a Mesopotamian tablet contains an enciphered formula for the making of glazes for pottery.       500-600 BC; civ; Kahn p.77; Hebrew scribes writing down the book of Jeremiah used a reversed-alphabet simple substitution cipher known as ATBASH. (Jeremiah started dictating to Baruch in 605 BC but the chapters containing these bits of cipher are attributed to a source labeled ``C'' (believed not to be Baruch) which could be an editor writing after the Babylonian exile in 587 BC, someone contemporaneous with Baruch or even Jeremiah himself.)
     ATBASH was one of a few Hebrew ciphers of the time.       487 BC; govt; Kahn p.82; the Greeks used a device called the ``skytale'' -- a staff around which a long, thin strip of leather was wrapped and written on. The leather was taken off and worn as a belt. Presumably, the recipient would have a matching staff and the encrypting staff would be left home.       50-60 BC; govt; Kahn p.83; Julius Caesar (100-44 BC) used a simple substitution with the normal alphabet (just shifting the letters a fixed amount) in government communciations. This cipher was less strong than ATBASH, by a small amount, but in a day when few people read in the first place, it was good enough.
1564; civ; Kahn p.144(footnote); Bellaso published an autokey cipher improving on the work of Cardano who appears to have invented the idea.       1623; civ; Bacon; Sir Francis Bacon described a cipher which now bears his name -- a biliteral cipher, known today as a 5-bit binary encoding. He advanced it as a steganographic device -- by using variation in type face to carry each bit of the encoding.       1585; civ; Kahn p.146; Blaise de Vigenère wrote a book on ciphers, including the first authentic plaintext and ciphertext autokey systems (in which previous plaintext or ciphertext letters are used for the current letter's key). [Kahn p.147: both of these were forgotten and
re-invented late in the 19th century.] [The autokey idea survives today
in the DES CBC and CFB modes.]       1790's; civ/govt; Kahn p.192, Cryptologia v.5 No.4 pp.193-208; Thomas Jefferson, possibly aided by Dr. Robert Patterson (a mathematician at U. Penn.), invented his wheel cipher. This was re-invented in several forms later and used in WW-II by the US Navy as the Strip Cipher, M-138-A.       1817; govt; Kahn p.195; Colonel Decius Wadsworth produced a geared cipher disk with a different number of letters in the plain and cipher alphabets -- resulting in a progressive cipher in which alphabets are used irregularly, depending on the plaintext used.       1854; civ; Kahn p.198; Charles Wheatstone invented what has become known as the Playfair cipher, having been publicized by his friend Lyon Playfair. This cipher uses a keyed array of letters to make a digraphic cipher which is easy to use in the field. He also re-invented the Wadsworth device and is known for that one.       1857; civ; Kahn p.202; Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort's cipher (a variant of what's called ``Vigenère'') was published by his brother, after the admiral's death in the form of a 4x5 inch card.       1859; civ; Kahn p.203; Pliny Earle Chase published the first description of a fractionating (tomographic) cipher.       1854; civ; Cryptologia v.5 No.4 pp.193-208; Charles Babbage seems to have re-invented the wheel cipher.       1861-1980; civ; Deavours;           ``A study of United States patents from the issuance of the first cryptographic patent in 1861 through 1980 identified 1,769 patents which are primarily related to cryptography.'' [p.1]       1861; civ/(govt); Kahn p.207; Friedrich W. Kasiski published a book giving the first general solution of a polyalphabetic cipher with repeating passphrase, thus marking the end of several hundred years of strength for the polyalphabetic cipher.       1861-5; govt; Kahn p.215; during the Civil War, possibly among other ciphers, the Union used substitution of select words followed by word columnar-transposition while the Confederacy used Vigenère (the solution of which had just been published by Kasiski).       1891; govt/(civ); Cryptologia v.5 No.4 pp.193-208; Major Etienne Bazeries did his version of the wheel cipher and published the design in 1901 after the French Army rejected it. [Even though he was a military cryptologist, the fact that he published it leads me to rate this as (civ)
as well as govt.] End of copy from "CME's cryptography timeline." Thanks [and apologies]
to David Kahn, whose 1960s book is well worth buying, even today.
Professor Froomkin continues:
In view of the foregoing timeline excerpts, I would respectfully disagree.
[I am certain it _would_, with ballot-access-fairness reform,
but that's a side issue, like abortion, that should *not*
occupy this list. I am, however, quite willing to discuss it
by private e-mail. JMR]
Careful thought reveals a atrong suspicion that the "3/5ths people" [slaves] had more use for crypto at the time than free white males did, but I doubt much, if any, evidence of that activity was preserved, and I'm sure it was _forcefully_ discouraged if ever
discovered...My point is, slaves, or those who live in fear of eventual slavery, for whatever reason, have a strong affinity for cryptography. Note, for example, early use [mentioned in the timeline
above] by the Jewish people.

Sorry I misunderstood you, professor. I had always heard those "computer

Agreed. As my earlier post (sadly) admitted, the 9th is *NOT* in vogue

I wonder, and perhaps my kind friend Hadmut can help me here, if there is
an English translation of any and all Nazi-era German laws/regs regarding cryptography. As I [dimly] recall, Enigma was born as a private enterprise
and the patent was only later taken over by government and classified after
it was offered for sale to businesses (without much luck). These laws, if
they exist, might make for interesting reading in side-by-side comparison with either Sen. Grassley's latest proposals, or with anything regarding cryptography coming from our paranoid FBI director.

[I hope this info. isn't already posted, my sincere apologies if it

Why not? It gets the issue talked about when it otherwise wouldn't be.
The cypherpunks are the Dr. Kevorkians of stupid US export laws.
Exactly. I plan to go to the Nandotimes article at URL
and see what it looks like with a few substitutions like
"cars," "highways," and "doorlocks" for words like "encode"
or "encrypt." Sarcasm is often the last refuge libertarians
have in these humor-impaired times, but it keeps me sane. :)
Well, not exactly. I believe from what I've seen here before that
it was Kelly Goen(sp?) who did this. Of course, I've advocated
everyone taking legal responsibility for Kelly's actions as a kind
of protest against creeping Naziism in "our" government (see my
"An Old Idea" post, buried somewhere in the c-punk archives).
Encryption _IS_ a party issue, and quite possibly an effective one
if we used it correctly, for the *Libertarian* Party! The actions
of both "major" parties would have been [IMO] bad PR if the media
decided to do their jobs (I know, big "if"). There is, of course, institutional L. party resistance to putting the individual right
to strong encryption on the "front burner" because our "generals,"
despite a consistent record of losing battles, insist on fighting
the last war (that is, when we aren't busy fighting eachother).

@_subject: Re: Netscape gives in to key escrow 
[Warning: More linguistic than crypto relevance follows.]
Indeed. One of the main libertarian objections to the term "key escrow"
is the "it's Newspeak" objection. "Escrow" [from the Hypertext Webster Interface at  ] means:
1. es.crow \'es-.kro-, es-'\ n [MF escroue scroll] 1: a deed, a bond,
money, or a piece of property delivered to a third person to be delivered
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^
by him to the grantee only upon the fulfillment of a condition 2: a fund
or deposit designed to serve as an escrow 2. es.crow \es-'kro-, 'es-.\ vt : to place in escrow __________ [emphasis added.]
The number of cases that begin: "US v. ___," or that end: "___ v. US,"
puts the lie to the idea that the government could somehow be *any
sort* of a "third person" in many of the cases that come before the
(government employees, albeit with some autonomy, known as) judges.
Mine is, of course, the libertarian view of "the government as one
giant blob," as opposed to various contrary views of "the government
as many wonderful-but-separate agencies who are all just trying to
do their best." My view, while certainly not the majority view, is
pervasive enough that [IMO] the current government terminology of
"key escrow" *should* change to a less Orwellian term.
I liked the term "FUCKED" better, but I guess I can settle for "GAK."

@_subject: 3rd party beneficiaries and certificates 
Dear cypherpunks:
Professor Froomkin posted the following interesting questions to
cyberia-L, and gave me permission to repost them here. Please
direct any private replies to him . My
apologies to those of you who hang out in both dens for having
to see the same message twice.
[Forwarded message follows]
I've been trying to work something out.  (I've written these questions in the form of an exam because it's that time of year.  In fact, I'm struggling with these in a paper I'm working on.)
Carol runs a certificate authority (CA).  She sells a certificate to Alice
binding Alice's public key to her name and email address.  In version (A)
of the contract Carol posts the certificate on her web site.  In version
(B) of the contract Alice gets a floppy disk with the certificate.
The certificate is in error (due to Alice's fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation to Carol).  Bob relies on it to his detriment in a transaction with Alice.  Assume Bob can show but for causation of his loss.
Bob now wishes to sue Carol for negligent misrepresentation.  He has, I think, three possible theories.
1) UCC.  This turns on whether a certificate is a "good" or a "service". {Assume the answer is "service" for the rest of this hypo}
2) Contract.  Bob has to show that he's an intended beneficiary under the restatement 2d test.  This seems to be almost a theological question.  Is the purpose of the certificate to give Alice a tool to induce Bob to transact, or to give Bob a benefit without which he will not transact?
3 )Tort of negligent misrepresentation.  To make this especially exciting, let's assume all the action is in NY where the shadow of Cardozo still looms.  NY retains a strong privity rule: You can only recover for a negligent misrepresentation if you are in privity of contract with the Question 1: If Bob is an intended beneficiary, is he in privity with Carol? (I think the answer is "yes").
Question 2: Are Bob's rights, or his status as an intended beneficiary, affected by whether the contract is form A or form B above?  The classic cases, like Ultramares have the accountant's report spread around by the client.  Suppose the accountant in Ultramares instead publishes the report on the Web -- what result?
OK, now we change the facts.  We're not in NY anymore, we are in a state that follows the restatement 2d rule in sec. 552.  Question 3: Is Bob within the class of forseeable users entitled to
recover for the tort of negligent misrepresentation as these terms are
used in the restatement?
Question 4: Is the certificate a good or a service? (I say it's a service, mostly, unless it makes no representations at all about its Extra credit: Look up and find the disclaimers in THE BIG TYPE.  Do you know of any court that would enforce these?   On a "good"?  On a "service" provider?

@_subject: Re: "Strongly Voluntary" Key Escrow 
I do too, and I hate it enough that I must (again) object to any use of
it where there is not a _NEUTRAL_, _THIRD_ party involved, as explained
before on the list (at length) by me, James A. Donald, and many others.
[So, why are you *again* consuming bandwidth on this subject, Jim?]
Because I love the English language, and because I am quite aware that
those who define the terms end up winning the debate, every time. I do
not want the word "escrow" in a key context to go the way of the word
"voluntary" in an income-tax context (or the word "take" in an enviro-
law context). The government has snaked in a Newspeak meaning for the
latter two terms, but I hope that cypherpunks will only use the term
"GAK" when talking to or about the government. Failure to do so will
not only put "our side" in a worse public-relations position, it may
(in the future) do violence to the English language. While I enjoyed
Tim & Uni's "voluntary" sarcasm, I think we have enough material for
*ample* humor without adding even more words to the Newspeak roll.
"Government Key Certification" might be an OK compromise-term compared
to "key escrow," but we should [IMNSHO] continue to stick to "GAK." As
you know, I prefered the term "FUCKED," but now we must be "decent" in
our communications. I can think of only two, but perhaps there are others:
1. Government employees (but only while working on government time).
2. Convicted felons (I wouldn't include the failed drugwar's felons).
Indeed, but we have already "lost" the word "voluntary" to Newspeak,
which is why it's necessary to qualify it with words like "strictly"
and "strongly."

Hello again cypherpunks:
[In order to conserve bandwidth, I am going to ask for 5 things at
once which have nothing to do with each-other in this post. Please
reply to me privately if it's at all possible.  ]
1. I have searched the archives for the author/artist of the "Rose on

I have seen a number of beautiful logos during this search, but no-
body has pointed me to the author of this particular logo. Any help
finding this person would be _much_ appreciated. TIA.
2. I keep hearing every once-in-a-while about PGP3.0 (coming "real-
soon-now") but there's nothing specific about what's delaying it. I
would urge the developers (whoever they are) to release version 3.0
*before* the upcoming US presidential election, and I am interested
in finding out more. TIA.
3. I have been asked by a Libertarian Party presidential candidate
for a proposed platform plank in favor of strong, private, non-"GAK"
encryption. [OK! I've stopped saying "FUCKED"!] Of course, I want
the maximum cypherpunk input possible, so feel free to suggest. The
wording must *not* be too technical in nature and should (of course)
condemn ITAR.  It should explain the real meaning of "escrow"
and the "Newspeak" version in as few words as possible. TIA for any
help on this. I'll post my final version if there's enough interest.

anti-strong-crypto law by using PGP? What happened? Did the French
people just roll over? TIA for any pointers (in English, please).

and Professor Froomkin responded:
I agree with the Professor (although as a native Floridian, I dispute
his .sig about it being warm here!:)) but AFAIK, and unless there are
court orders to the contrary, members of the jury may speak freely
*after* dismissal from grand jury duty. Our problem is finding them
(which shouldn't be *too* hard, given the technology we have). IMO,
after the jury is dismissed we must _not_ contact them directly, but
rather make it clear that we would be happy if they were to contact
us. Hopefully, one of our journalist-types could manage this without
yet-another article giving out the  address.
Presumably, grand-jurors who have carefully followed the court's
instructions would have a bit of catch-up reading on the subject
to do, thus giving us an opportunity for indirect contact with them.
I don't think that this would be illegal, but best to check with a
real-lawyer, and perhaps research the issue a bit, since PRZ's case
(supposedly) has "national security" overtones which could possibly
cause a court to want to hush things.

@_subject: An Enigma - Wrapped In a Circle 
In the January/February 1996 Mensa Bulletin on pages 9-10 is an
article by Teresa Fisher titled "An Enigma Wrapped In a Circle."
The article is about a phenomenon which has interested me for quite
some time, "crop circles" or "pictograms." I have tried to find
this excellent article on the web and failed, so I will quote a few
parts of it I consider relevant. All typos are mine, Ms. Fisher is
an excellent writer, and I have changed her well done presentation
only for brevity and clarity. If you think that this post has "no
cypherpunk relevance" you can:
1. Flame me, in *private* e-mail. [I'll happily ignore you.]
2. Go hump a tree.
Article excerpts (in quotes) and my comments follow:
"In the late 1970s, farmers over the world were finding unexplainable,
perfectly round, flattened areas in their grain fields. The flattened
crops made irreproducible, layered swirl patterns. As time went on
and crop circle incidents increased tremendously, the outlines of the
formations became more complex and came to be called pictograms."
They appeared overnight, "[by 1990] some 2000 circles and pictograms
had been formed all over the world. A large percentage...were showing
up in a small area in southern England, mainly in Wiltshire Downs."
"Then, in 1991, two retired Englishmen named Doug Bower and Dave
Chorley announced that they had been responsible for the crop circle
phenomenon for the past 13 years." The dim media swallowed this hook,
line, and sinker; neglecting to question "how they created intricate,
sometimes braided swirls, executed elaborate pictograms in the dark,
and caused crop formations in 19 other countries besides England."
Brittle plants in the (non-hoaxed) circles were also bent in a way
"that no investigator has been able to duplicate."
Recent tests, including some at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories,
show isotope changes in the soil, and differing biophysical and
biochemical properties of the grain within the pictograms when
compared to adjacent grain in the field.
Gerald Hawkins was not fooled. He did "a systematic study of the
geometry of the circles, and found ratios of small whole numbers
that precisely matched the ratios defining the diatonic scale.
Further statistical analysis revealed three other geometric theorems
in the circle patterns, and he realized that all four theorems had
a common thread that led to a fifth, more general theorem. His
inability to find any of these theorems in Euclidean geometry or
any of the math books he consulted caused him to conclude that
whoever is making the circles had to not only know how to prove a
Euclidean theorem, but also to conceive of an original theorem.
Hawkins says that proving a theorem is easy; conceiving it in the
first place is quite another matter."
["FN 6 Ivars Peterson, "Euclid's Crop Circles," *Science News* 141,
No. 5, pp. 76-77."]
In late 1991 in Ickleton "a perfect depiction of the mathematical
configuration known as the Mandelbrot Set" appeared.
["FN 9 Beth Davis, *Ciphers in the Crops,* (Bath, England:
Gateway Books, 1992)pp. 9-15."]
I am now experiencing Tim's wish that I could draw in e-mail, as
there is a diagram here of "a circle inside a triangle inside a ring inside a hexagon inside a ring." Don't even *try* to imagine
it. The article points out that "NASA will be promoting the space
program with a crop circle image and the slogan, 'We need to be
out there.'" [Agreed, but with *tax* money?] Back to Ms. Fisher.
"I have been amazed at the need many people have to dismiss this
mystery. They will ignore all of the evidence to claim that the
circles are being formed by weather or hoaxers. Neither claim
stands up to even minimal scrutiny. I don't know what is causing
crop circles to appear, but I'm certain it isn't being done by
the wind or by an old man with a board. What do you think?"
I must add that anyone who has seen the cover of Robert Plant's
"Now and Zen" album would have trouble believing that a couple
of drunks from the pub down the street did _THAT_! I do not
know if "extraterrestrials" or "UFOs" are responsible for these
images. [In my long-held opinion, governments tend to lie about
UFOs (surprise!).] I do feel that these pictograms, these "Ciphers
in the Crops," cry out for cryptanalysis, by someone far more
adept at complex mathematics than I am. Results might well be felt
worldwide. Thoughts?

will necessarily be very brave people, but IMO brave people _are_ there.
I won't say bravery of that sort is common, but there are many people

to this [admittedly ambitious] goal as direct crypto transfers are, as

Tim, you're giving up too quickly on most of the rest of the planet.
As long as repression ever works somewhere, statists will attempt to
(selectively) use annoying examples of how "orderly" it makes life.
It's a one-way ratchet: When a moron bombs a building here, the US
politicians cancel a repeal of the "assault weapons" ban. When some
moron plants a bomb in London (or Paris) their politicians' reaction
is not exactly the reverse...
I think that these statistics are likely correct, but I think it's not
important, and we can't just give up this easily...We already know that
China will be swallowing Hong Kong, a haven of capitalism, and IMHO we
should work to make this process as "interesting" as possible. Anonymity
is likely to upset the Chinese authorities as much as it upset the CO$.
I know nobody in Hong Kong who will be staying, but I'm sure that some
people on this list do, and Hong Kong is likely to be a better place for
us to "infiltrate" than Beijing. Time is short, but if the fax machine
gave us Tienanmen(sp?) I am optimistic about e-mail. Singapore residents
(at least, those with a hankering for chewing-gum) might feel they have

Professor Froomkin is right (IMO) but I think that the way he puts

If I were a US Attorney, I would bide my time and pick a hard case,
involving lots of potentially incriminating (and therefore tempting)
encrypted files, an available key, and (at least) two horsemen. The
unavailability of the key can then be presented as a "technicality,"
allowing a bad guy to possibly get off. After I get some precedent
it can then be streched over those inconvenient provisions in the
Bill of Rights. This is how "hard cases make bad law."
I agree, but if I were sitting at Anguilla's side of the table (I

@_subject: Re: Freedom and security 
There may be some word-definition problems here. I believe Mr.
McNally refers to the words freedom and security as applied to
individuals, and CyberAngels refers to them as applied to the
whole of society. When all the flowery rhetoric is removed,
society is made up of individuals, and individuals almost by
definition disagree on the meanings and relative importance
in their own lives of freedom and security. For example, I
feel not-a-lot of freedom being Vince's munition exporter but Louis Freeh doubtless feels more secure with a statist law
like ITAR around. FBI Director Freeh and I are both part of
society, and I can refer to the two of us as "we," but "we"
clearly disagree on freedom and security. His side has more
guns, along with the media, and my side has more people who
tell the truth. He is free to open up all his private email
to government snoops if he wants to, but he may not open mine,
because I do not trust him. He also may not dictate the content
of my webpage, which includes my possibly-indecent babypictures.
I agree. Freedom is already diminishing at an alarming pace.
That is why cypherpunks spread crypto, and why Libertarians like
me rant. Freedom does not increase through more laws. _Parents_,
NOT governments, ISPs, cops, villages, and so on, are responsible
for raising children. Parents sometimes raise kids in ways that I
disagree with, but I am unwilling to advocate laws that prevent
it because such laws only breed more laws, which always lead to
less freedom.
I am unsure what this means. I want Jim Ray drawing my lines,
because I think he does a better job of it than Director Freeh,
even if his side has more/better guns than mine. I feel that his
side is in a different, much better armed, and much more trigger-
happy "camp" than mine.
Good. Join us in spreading cryptography around, and security will
bloom (along with freedom).

@_subject: Re: Freedom and security 
You have gotta be kidding me, but let's start by differentiating
among laws. I'm a crypto-minarchist, not a crypto-anarchist, so
I still have hope for some (MUCH less) government. I think laws
against murder are good, and lead to more safety for those not in
jail. I think laws against "consensual crimes" are bad, and lead
to government/police corruption extending all the way to the top
[see sigfile]. When I have to say, "where's the victim?" it's a
shitty law. Many laws fail my test.
This is what I called flowery rhetoric in the last post.
This is what astounds me, the advocates of more government always
focus on crimes WITH obvious victims during debates. Once power
is achieved, the victimless crime laws get written. I have said
I do want murderers, and even some (not all) pedophiles, in jail.
If a child pornographer chooses to visit my page and commits a
thoughtcrime involving my babypictures, I say leave him alone. If
he commits a real crime with an unwilling victim I say punish him
even more than the present government punishes him. Libertarians,
when we achieve political power, will find ourselves with abundent
jail cells left over from the tax-and-spend drugwar to put real
criminals (the ones who have an individual victim) in.
There are certainly enough statists who feel a need to increase it.
I am heartened by your opposition to the CDA (though I did not
notice a Cyberangels voice in the debate/protest leading up to
this abominable law...) but I must point out that you offer no
good test, like my "where's the victim?" test, to differentiate
good laws from bad ones. As to more laws leading to less freedom
I stand by my words. Go down to any law library and have a look
at the Code of Federal Regulations. As wordy, poorly-written laws
proliferate, we all become "criminals," subject to the arbitrary
power of the state's prosectors. When the state prosecutors are
a partisan Democrat followed by a partisan Republican, and the
"criminals" are high-ranking Democrats and Republicans, you end
up with a lesser respect for all laws, even the good ones. Again,
see my sigfile. Now imagine the Libertarian party was doing the
same drug-smuggling...Would the feds [let alone the media] be
so silent? I doubt it.
I find it worrisome that you capitalize the word, despite my rant
involving Director Freeh. I repeat: The community is made up of
Therefore, I guess, the "Community" must forcibly take my key
to make sure that last PGPmessage wasn't child porn, right?
It is important to make sure I don't commit thoughtcrime.
Look. I don't care if some old man beats off to the tune of baby
pictures. There is no victim. If he finds a victim, toss him in
the slammer, or kill him. Right now, the tax-and-spend drugwar is
creating a revolving-door justice system when it comes to victim
crimes, and the people (naturally) disrespect the law. Respect
for ALL law, good and bad, is poisoned by this foolishness and
when combined with a disrespect for the historical power of
juries to nullify shitty laws, and ignorance of history.
Oh, why bother with this self-help, vigilante solution to the
need for authentication. Why not just pass another law? PGP is
a pain-in-the-ass to install and learn. I'm sure the Congress
and President Clinton (who has also experienced e-mail forgery)
would support it, and then you won't have to bother learning
PGP or reading that awful PGPdoc1 & PGPdoc2.
I think it should be legal for me to sell my body for sex, or put
any substance into it I choose, because _I_ own my body.
The "Community" may think I'm evil for advocating this immoral
misuse of "their" property...
At the same time, I may think the "Community" evil for trying to
steal/claim my property...

around. Which one is it?

and more $ gives you more "votes" on who to kill. Oligarchy, a
rule by the rich. I stuck exactly to it. Read more carefully
in the *non-header* part of messages, too.
HUH???? "buckarchy" isn't in my dictionary...I neither twisted

Tim May has written well on this, and on why. [Hi Tim.]
That's not how I view statists. Your faith is admirable,
but I won't share it soon. Hitler, Stalin, Clinton, Bush,
Biden, Dole, etc. - they all would just as soon see me as
hamburger as milk cow. As hamburger I'm no longer such a
smart-ass under their skins.
I have seen how history describes the minds of statists who
don't get their way & it's not pretty. _Many_ statists have
the $ to kill me, without AP, this would make me cheap and
compromise the privacy of the remailernet [probably] or just
cause remailers to be outlawed. If I operated a remailer,
and you bought or sold 500 lbs of cannabis through it, I
would try to cooperate to the minimum possible extent of
the law, ad perhaps go to jail for contempt, it depends.
If you tried AP, I would let the BATF (yes, I hate them,
too) log all your use (while trying to somehow protect my
innocent users' privacy). I again boil it down to my Jim
Ray test:"Where's the victim?"
And now, it's likely that I am, too. Allow me to reduce noise
even furter by preemptively saying "Plonk" right now, so it
doesn't need to be announced twice on the poor, groaning list.
It's not that, I was speaking of post-frequency-noise. I had
seen the idea before Jimbell ever had it, in Tim May's

I managed to miss seeing the Deputy Attorney General, whose name I will

decided to briefly delurk to ask a question I have wondered about for
some time:
Who (an *individual's name*, not a department, please) came up with my
unfavorite Orwellian-term, "key escrow"? I think it was likely a Bush
administration official, and probably an attorney [ie. should have known
better]. I am, as many of you know, trying to redefine the terms of the
debate to our favored term, "GAK" -- although I must say the temptation
was strong to try for "Federal Usurpation of Crypto Keys [etc.]" but I
feel it's important to try to keep the debate polite until they reach
the "cold, dead neurons" stage...
Anyway, I assume this Bush administration official, like David Kessler,
 is still a government employee -- and I would very much like to
write a polite (believe it or not) letter to him or her, concerning the
origin of the term. I will, of course, report back to the list if I get
a reply.

After a conversation with a well-respected cypherpunk in private email,
I have been convinced to reveal publicly that at age 6 [first grade] I
had access to a .22 semiautomatic rifle and a 12GA shotgun, with good
safety instruction and accuracy in each (though the 12GA's kick took a
bit of getting-used-to). I was instructed to shoot any burglar, and I
feel lucky that we never had any. The thought of taking these (or any!)
guns to school _never_ entered my mind. I drove a car (on private land)
when I was only a bit older. There are certain 6 year olds who are quite
capable of taking proper responsibility with firearms, and there are also
certain 26 year olds who probably should reconsider gun ownership.
That's life. The reason I posted this non-cryptography stuff (sorry,

"gun culture," (which is actually more a gun-safety culture, IMO) in
this country. Gun-grabber-hypocrites like syndicated columnist Carl

Apologies if you get this twice, and I would only add that in any election there are winners and losers, and the sets of losers on cypherpunks if Harry Browne wins or does does well are:
1. Lawyers. If laws are simpler and better-written in something approaching the English language and judges who respect the constitution are selected-for, lawyers and law-professors would feel the economic effects of less demand for their services.
2. Accountants. If the tax laws are simplified and the IRS is eliminated, there will be less need for accountants to figure out what people actually owe in taxes.
3. Offshore dataheaven providers. ;) If the above happens, running businesses from the US will be relatively more attractive than running them from Anguilla, all other things being equal.

As the designated partisan Libertarian on the list, I urge all cypherpunks to vote their consciences and pick Harry Browne and Jo Jorgensen. The mere fact that the media is [grudgingly] covering us suggests we are finally doing something right, and Harry is winning many Internet polls despite much fawning, hopeful coverage for the big-eared billionaire hypocrite stealth-candidate, who has no position on much of anything, but certainly would enjoy having the TLAs investigate his enemies.
I fully accept that it is likely Dole or Clinton will win, but I think it will fill an important cypherpunk goal if the Libertarian Party candidates get a vote large enough to be the margin of victory, and I will be very proud of my vote, no matter who wins this election.

Again, and as Tim is aware, this is not the true meaning of the fine
old word "escrow," which as we all know involves neutral, trusted
third parties. I think that this requires a new term, so I am now
proposing one: "GAR -- Government Access to Remailers." In real life,
the gar is a fish that lives in great numbers in the Everglades, just
west of where I type. They can grow to a very large size. The fossil
record indicates that this species has been around, unchanged, since
dinosaur times. Keeping the Pinnochio tale in mind, I find it quite
fitting that the gar has a *very* long nose in relation to its body.

[This has nothing to do with cryptography, but it is
related to other posts seen here recently.]
Miami Herald reports today on page 3A that the National
Transportation Safety Bureaucrats are "investigating an
American Airlines pilot's report that a missile zoomed
by his 757 on Aug. 29 as it flew near NASA and Navy
facilities in Virginia on its way to Boston."
An NTSB spokesman has confirmed an investigation (termed
a 'preliminary probe') is ongoing. Not to be outdone,
the FAA is investigating as well. All this is according
to the Herald, and I offer no opinions about veracity or
trustworthiness of this particular media organ or what
caused the crash of flight 800.
