Hello all,
   I am considering writing a research paper on how the
constitution will hold up in light of rapidly changing technology and the use of it.  The main issue I plan on addressing is the right to privacy.  My concern is that I will not be able to find enough "scholaly works"
that address this issue.  I know that opinions abound, but I am in need of citeable sources.  Any ideas?  Has much been published on this issue?

@_subject: BlackNet - what is it? 
I have seen BlackNet referred to several times.  Could someone
say a few words about it?
