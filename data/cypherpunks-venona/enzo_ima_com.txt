In any case, Trumpet Winsock has got a buit-in socksifier, even in the non-time-limited version 2.0b. It's activated by the "Firewall setup" dialogue box, and seems to work: I've just tested it with a sockd 4.2b running on a Linux box. NEC's DLL will add the same functionality to other stacks, but experimental encrypting relays could be tested right now with Trumpet Winsock.
Think about it, this could be the ultimate encryption hook: I don't think that NSA could arrive to ban firewall support...

Hal and others interested in HTTP proxying: I've just found an interesting alternative to CERN httpd at  . I haven't yet played with it, but it looks promising. Caching should also play a useful role defeating traffic analysis, besides increasing the throughput.
  HIERARCHY
   The Harvest cache implements hierarchical caching: your cache at home
   can resolve URLs through your lab cache, which in turn can resolve
   requests through your institutional cache, which in turn can resolve
   requests through your regional network cache. The cache resolution
   algorithm, at each stage in the hierarchy, distinguishes parents from
   neighbor caches. A parent cache is a cache higher up the hierarchy,
   while a neighbor cache is one at the same level in the hierarchy.

How could it be worse than with the U.S. of A.?? ;-)
Seriously: you may bank in US Dollars (or other major currencies) in many
countries, including all the offshore banking centres. Limited amounts of
cash may be withdrawn using ATM dispensers, against a fee of two or three
USD per operation; for larger amounts, you may ask them to wire money by
SWIFT, Telex or bank drafts to other banks or genric payees. For such
operations, most large banks accept instructions by snail mail, and
sometimes by fax (if the customer signs a letter of indemnity exempting
the bank from liabilities in case of forgeries). Sadly, AFAIK no bank is
accepting digitally encrypted and signed e-mail instructions, and issuing digitally encrypted and signed receipts.

@_subject: Re: Zimmermann legal fund 
Hey, I was joking: even without arriving to such extremes, banking in
Europe is, more often than not, a much worse experience than in USA. My
point, anyway, was that there are many offshore banking centres where you
may keep accounts denominated in USD, Deutsche Marks, Swiss Francs or
other reputable currencies, and also choose branches of reputable
international banks, even American ones if you like (Citybank, Chase and
many other are represented world-wide). Personally, as bank I like the
HSBC Holdings group or other "British-overseas" institutions like Standard
Chartered, and as haven currency the Singapore Dollar (due to the very strong
balance sheet of that country). In any case, the depositor may choose.
Unfortunately, the costs of international transfers of funds are still
pretty high, even between branches of the same bank. If I remit funds from
Hong Kong to another country, my bank charges me HKD 100. (around USD 20)
per operation, flat. In other countries there are additional commissions
proportional to the amount (0.125% from Singapore, 0.1% from Macau etc).
Sometimes, charges are levied on incoming remittances too. That situation
is partly dependent on the regulatory framework, and partly on the
oligopolistic nature of the banking business. In any case, it makes
international transfers not viable for the settlement of small bills; that
may be the reason why First Virtual is still stuck with USA-only merchant
accounts. Now, my main objection to opening a US account is that it's unclear
whether or not, for simply receiving payments there, a non-resident and
non-citizen account holder like myself incurs in any tax liability with
Uncle Sam's Inland Revenue. Can anybody on this list shed light on the issue? Last time I checked, the guys at FV weren't sure either.

@_subject: Re: ssh protocol 
Yes, I'm interested too, also because cryptotcp looks like a good
candidate as component of my "SafeSox" pet project, to make unmodified TCP
applications secure. Apparently, a sockd daemon could be easily modified
to open encrypted TCP connections to remote cryptod daemons, instead of
targeting remote servers directly. The next logical step would be a
Winsock (or Mac) version of that cryptified sockd, to be run on the same
PC where the applications live (not everybody has a UNIX box on the same
network). No modifications would be required in cryptod: Unmod. --- [socksifying DLL] === [crypto-sockd] ~~~~ [cryptod] +++ [server]
Winsock --- = local API call
=== = local SOCKS connection (same network or same machine)
~~~ = cryptotcp connection across the Internet
+++ = cleartext TCP connection on the same network or same machine
Another area where I would appreciate analysis by someone more competent
than myself is cryptotcp's random key generator. Even though the
randomizer (in random.c) is called several times, stirring in the pool
also quantities of entropy depending on the time spent during the
establishment of the TCP connection, I doubt that the total resulting
entropy can be that high.  Perhaps, adding some purely local data a' la
randseed.bin (not available to an eavesdropper) would reduce the risk of
the scheme being brute-forced.

of adding CryptoTCP client capabilities to a SOCKS 4.2 daemon. I see three major areas for improvement:
1. A better PRNG for the session key
2. Authentication of the D-H key exchange with digital signatures, a` la 3. Less "hard-wired" structure: at present, for example, the module size for D-H calculations is fixed at 1024 bits.
1. and 2. are relatively easy, but 3. would require a lot of work.

Adding MD5 support wouldn't be a bad idea. Same for algorithms alternative to Blowfish (3DES etc.) and DH (e.g., with Elliptic functions-based key exchange), all automatically negotiated at connection I think that Wei's idea is for something more general, similar to the
CryptoTCP 0.9 posted a few months ago by ModX and available from (that one used unauthenticated DH key exchange and 3DES, IMHO with a highly questionable PRNG for the generation of the session key).
It would be enormously more useful and popular if someone could write a
Winsock redirector loadable after WINSOCK.DLL but before any Winsock
application, hooking the API functions used to open TCP connections. That
would mean instant transport-level crypto capability for most Winsock
apps, just like NEC's SocksCap provides instant SOCKS (alas, V.4)
compliance. Also Perry's invitation to join the IPSEC effort should be given proper
attention (I would do it, if only my spare time were not in such short
supply). I would try to implement it on SLiRP, a free SLIP/PPP simulator
largely based on BSD TCP/IP code (but running in user mode). That would
allow to experiment without having to hack the kernel, and would have a
practical value for converting conventional login accounts into
IPSEC-compliant SLIP/PPP accounts (instant crypto, again). Networking
technologies gain much faster popularity once a critical mass of users
actually use them. And to reach that mass, we must enlist all the non-techies who just run unmodified Windows applications.

File name: ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/security/cryptl99.zip
One line description: Free encryption library for Unix/DOS/Windows
This encryption library provides a universal interface to a number of conventional-key encryption algorithms.  The library currently supports encryption algorithms and modes of MDC/SHS CFB, DES ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, PCBC, triple DES ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, IDEA ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, RC4, SAFER ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and SAFER-SK ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB.  All encryption routines are accessed through a single standardised interface with parameters such as algorithm, mode and key size being selectable by the user.  The library is supplied as source code for Unix, DOS, and the Amiga, and as dynamic link libraries for Windows and Windows NT.
The design goal for the library was to create an easy-to-use, standardised interface to a number of popular encryption algorithms.  Like the standard C file I/O libraries which work with FILE objects, this library works with an "encryption context" of type CRYPT_INFO.  To encrypt data, you create an encryption context, load a user key into it, en/decrypt data, and destroy it when you've finished.  This concept lends itself to implementation either as a C++ class or as C routines.
The library has been written to be as idiot-proof as possible.  On initialization it performs extensive self-testing against test data from encryption standards documents, and the API's check each parameter and function call for errors before any actions are performed, with error reporting down to the level of individual parameters.
The library API serves as an interface to a range of plug-in encryption modules which allow encryption algorithms to be added in a fairly transparent manner.  The standardised API allows any of the algorithms and modes supported by the library to be used with a minimum of coding effort.  As such the main function of the library is to provide a standard, portable, easy-to-use interface between the underlying encryption routines and the user software.
All code is plain ANSI C, with no machine or OS-specific functions or calls being used.

there because, once gone to Redmond, won't be re-exportable. On the other
hand, I suspect that writing a binary-compatible CAPI emulator shouldn't
be that difficult. That would allow to use the same CAPI-compliant applications anywhere in the world, running over different implementations of the crypto engine.
The interesting part is that the basic, but crippled, CSP (PROV_RSA_FULL) will be supplied for free by MS:
-- -- 8< -----------
Microsoft licensed cryptographic technology from RSA Data Security to create the base or default software CSP that ships with the operating
system. The Microsoft RSA Base provider consists of a software implementation PROV_RSA_FULL provider type (see accompanying table of
provider types). This CSP supports both public-key and symmetric (or "conventional") cryptography. It is exportable and will ship everywhere
that the CryptoAPI is present.

Actually, it is. I've been living in South-East Asia for almost one
decade now, and I can tell you that most citizen are more socially
conservative than their governments. A few years ago, the Singapore
government had to backtrack from a very timid relaxation of rules on
soft-porn movies due to the negative reactions from the public. In
Singapore, the problem is compounded by the need of preserving good relationships with the even more conservative Malay minority, whose stances have strong backing by the two large neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia
(the case I mentioned had prompted accusations to the government, by members of the opposition Workers Party, of planning the "corruption of the Islamic youth").
Of course, one may argue that the racial, social and religious relations
are better handled the American way. That, however, is a controversial
issue, and adopting confrontational cowboy attitudes is not going to make
the social evolution any faster. Besides, I don't think that the Singapore
government can really believe to be able of blocking access to anything on
the net: a while ago I had the occasion of talking with some medium rank
officers, and they sounded fully aware of the Internet technology and its

I agree with what you say, and that's exactly why all this thread is out
of focus. Blocking anything on the net is impossible, we know it and, I'm
sure, the Singapore government knows it as well. The filtering proxies
they deployed, however, allow them to show that they are "doing something" and get continued support from the socially conservative constituency; the
net will route around, and life will go on.  If the purpose of those
measures had been political censorship, the SG government would have
banned crypto or simply restricted Internet access, as they have done with
mass media like satellite TV. Hovever, they on one hand know that Internet
is strategic to the country's future development, and on the other hand
that its use is limited to a well-educated elite not likely to fall prey
of simplistic propaganda as tabloid readers would be, and that would be
able to find sources of free information anyway: hence, the green light.
Let's not fool ourselves: social mores are determined by economic
development, which in turn is driven by technology and free markets.

some cases it may backfire). When a government pursues free market and
technological advancement, time is on freedom's side.

Only if you assume that values depend on the nature, which James didn't
say. (Besides, Greeks didn't need to rationalize: slavery was part of
their society, not only in cities like Sparta based on a caste-style
social structure, but also in the "democratic" Athens. Aristoteles
shrugged off the whole issue saying that slavery would have been abolished
only if "machines could move by themselves": and the prophecy has proven
accurate indeed).
Back to the nature vs nurture issue: even though I usually agree with most
of what you say, I must disagree with your .Sig file:
The idea that rights and values can be "natural" is contradicted by
several thousand years of history, during which absolutism or downright
tyranny have been well more common than freedom. The success of that misleading view in America, and by extension in most
of the western countries, is largely due to the unfortunate influence of
French rationalism over the founding fathers, as Hayek repeatedly noted. (A similar criticism of the theory of built-in values in Rousseau and his
followers, with emphasis on the ethical -as opposed to economic/
political- side, was moved by Nietzsche in "Human, all too human"). In the real world, freedom is a by-product of a materially prosperous
society (which is why capitalism generally produces free societies, but
socialism does not). Constitutional papers should spell what a society
guarantees to and what it expects from its members, not the (supposed)
nature of the latter. Trying to build a free society by screaming loud
what the "natural" rights are supposed to be, has no better chances of
success than trying to summon a god into existence by virtue of prayers.

industrialization, modern techniques and, crucially, open markets have
brought prosperity to politically totalitarian countries that,
*subsequently*, have developed more open institutions: Taiwan and Korea,
until recently, were more or less ugly fascist dictatorships. China's
GDP, since they ditched communism in favor of capit... er, "market
socialism", has grown on average about 10% a year: I believe that in 10 or
20 years the consequent increase in education and public awareness will
force some form of political liberalization as well (but don't forget that
their per-capita GDP is still 30 times lower than Hong Kong's and 10 times
tha Taiwan's).
Regarding the Habsburg Netherlands, that was very clearly a case of
rebellion for economic independence (not unlike the Boston Tea Party,
OTOH), and, before that, those provinces witnessed the birth of two
modern financial instruments: the tradeable government securities
tied to the excise and property tax imposed by Charles V in 1542, and, a few years later in Antwerp, the negotiable international bill of exchange.

On their ftp site they also have a version using SSL (via EAY's DLL's) supporting strong ciphers. The documentation, unfortunately, is very
terse. Otherwise it looks like a nice piece of middleware for implementing
secure TCP relays and tunnels.

Almost, but not quite: you forgot a trailing "l".
           Anyway, 512 bit for a permanent public key doesn't sound that safe. And
this phrase:
  Encrypting the Diffie-Hellman exchange and changing the dynamic common
  key every 24 hours foils "man-in-the-middle" attacks because each
  renegotiation authenticates the two boxes to each other.
sounds especially obscure to me. If the initial exchange of the "permanent
common private key" through a non-authenticated D-H key exchange was
compromised (as it is entirely possible) by a man-in-the-middle attack,
also the subsequent D-H key exchanges encrypted with that supposedly
common key will be subject to the same attack: actually there will be TWO
non-common private keys, and the man in the middle will know both of them.
