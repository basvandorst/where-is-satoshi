I am going to have to agree with you on this. A Sysadmin would have
to see the messages or data that is suppose be harassing the
complaintant. What I say is harassment may be different from what you
say it is.

@_subject: Premail PGP Keys 
tried the "premail -getkeys" but it never works. I tried to manually finger Matt's Pub Key area, but looks like he is down or has a different address. Is there somewhere else I can try to get the PGP Keys for the remailers, or does Matt have a different address? Any help would really be appreciated.
I know I am kinda behind but just starting out and would really appreciate any help I can get. Again Thanks in Advance....

Well, I guess I can now say the same thing. A new Remailer is available at hroller It is Cpunk, PGP, Hash, Latent, and Cut, I believe. This is one of sameer's Remailer-In-A-Box and should be just about the same for all c2.org remailers. If you have any problems please report to the same address. Have all mail forwarded to my other accout....

January 27, 1995 1030 PST                                        Number F-09
PROBLEM:       The Unix /bin/mail utility contains security vulnerabilities.
PLATFORMS:     DEC OSF/1 1.2, 1.3, and 2.0
               DEC Ultrix 4.3, 4.3A, and 4.4
               SCO Unix System V/386 Release 3.2 OS Version 4.2
               SCO Open Desktop Lite Release 3.0
               SCO Open Desktop Release 3.0
               SCO Open Server Enterprise System Release 3.0
               SCO Open Server Network System Release 3.0
               Solbourne OS4.1x
               SunOS 4.x
DAMAGE:        Local users may gain privileged (root) access.
SOLUTION:      Apply appropriate vendor patch as described below.
VULNERABILITY  The vulnerabilities in the /bin/mail program have been openly
ASSESSMENT:    discussed in several Internet forums, and automated scripts
               exploiting the vulnerabilities have been widely distributed.
               These tools have been used in many recent attacks.  CIAC
               recommends sites install these patches as soon as possible.
          Critical Information about Unix /bin/mail Vulnerabilities
The /bin/mail utility on several Unix versions based on BSD 4.3 Unix contain
a security vulnerability.  The vulnerability is the result of race conditions
that exist during the delivery of messages to local users.  These race
conditions will allow intruders to create or modify files on the system,
resulting in privileged access to the system.
Below is a summary of systems known to be either vulnerable or not
vulnerable.  If your vendor's name is not listed, please contact the vendor
or CIAC for more information.

DEC          The /bin/mail patch is a part of a comprehensive Security
             Enhanced Kit that addresses other security problems as well.
             This kit was released on May 17, 1994 and was described in
             DEC Security Advisory  and CIAC Notes 94-03.
             OSF/1 users should upgrade to a minimum of version 2.0 and
             install Security Enhanced Kit CSCPAT_4061 v1.0.  Ultrix users
             should upgrade to at least version 4.4 and install Security
             Enhanced Kit CSCPAT_4060 v1.0.
             Both kits are available from your Digital support channel or
             electronically by request via DSNlink.
SCO          Vulnerabilities in SCO's /bin/mail utility are removed by
             applying SCO's Support Level Supplement (SLS) uod392a. It is
             available via anonymous FTP from ftp.sco.com in the /SLS
             directory:
             Description   Filename       MD5 Checksum
             ------------  -------------  ------
For those sites unable to obtain a vendor patch for a vulnerable version of
made freely available on the Internet.  The /bin/mail program is relatively
complex software, serving both as a mail delivery agent and a user interface,
allowing users to send and read E-mail messages.  Complex system software,
like /bin/mail, is more likely to exhibit security vulnerabilities.
The mail.local package was written to perform only one task: the delivery
of mail to local users.  It is comparatively small, and the code has been
examined carefully by experts in the security community.  While it has not
been formally evaluated, it is probable that mail.local addresses all
vulnerabilities currently being exploited in /bin/mail.

I have been having problems trying to set up an account at
alpha.c2.org. I have followed all the instructions but am still unable to
get a reply or anything that works right. What I am doing wrong? This is what I have done so far. I am about to pull my hair out. I have been working on this for 2 days now. Anyway, 1. Created a Reply Block like this:  Request-Remailing-To: hroller 2. I then encrypted it with remailer Public Key. I prepended it
with the "Encrypted: PGP".  3. I then created the following message: Password: MyPassword Reply-Block: Anon-To: remailer Encrypted: PGP -------Begin PGP Message---------- "The Encrypted Reply Block Message"  ------End PGP Message------------- 4. I then sent it to "alias  Then I wait. But never get anything from alpha.c2.org.  I have gotten some anonymous messages from replay, but they are still encrypted so I don't know what it is sending me. Any help you can supply would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks to sameer, David and Joel M. for pidaho, it was working all the time. Those messages I was getting were the confimations. I just didn't know it. After decrypting the messages everything is working fine now. The only thing I didn't see in the Help files was that when you get confirmation from Alpha, it will be encrypted. But that was pointed out in Pidaho, Ver 2.5 Beta 6. Again thanks to all that helped.
