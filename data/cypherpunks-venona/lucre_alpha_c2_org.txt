@_subject: -lucre 0.8.1: ecash library for Unix available (with source, no blinding) 
We are pleased to announce the 0.8.1 ALPHA release of -lucre, a C library
which implements the protocols of ecash(tm).  This library was developed for
research purposes, so source is available, but to avoid patent issues,
blinding of coins is not currently supported.  Please read the README
(appended below) for more detailed information.
You can currently get -lucre by anonymous ftp to csclub.uwaterloo.ca, in the
directory /pub/-lucre.
If you need to reach us, the development team for -lucre, you can try
.  Our public key is in the README, below.  There is
also a mailing list set up for discussing the library.  To subscribe,
send email to  with a message (_not subject_) of
"subscribe dev-lucre".
We are providing this library so that people can study how ecash works,
and possibly come up with innovative ways of incorporating ecash into
existing systems.  Paying for remailers, for example, is a topic that
seems to come up again and again on some mailing lists.  Hopefully, it
will also encourage more people to open an account with Mark Twain Bank;
the more people who are using ecash, and the more shops that accept ecash,
the better the system will be.  We believe in open systems, not "security
through obscurity", or the "trust me" model of security, and so we saw
a full-source release to be important.
The distribution comes with the library itself, as well as a very simple
ecash client.  The client should be usable to accept or pay ecash (or, if
you discover it doesn't fit your needs, you can change it yourself), but,
of course, you don't get the anonymity offered by the patented blinding
feature of ecash.
The README is attached below; please read it, as it contains more useful
information about the use of this library.
