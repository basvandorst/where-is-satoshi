I apologize for any behavior on behalf of my domain name.
(A little background:)
I am a cryptographer hopeful. I was interested in such
things as the Caesar Cypher and the Enigma machine and the
Roman encryption "padlock" when other kids were more
interested in how the water fountain shot water straight up. After some thought and a little writing, I developed an encryption program using Mallard Basic on an old
Amstrad (which I still grudgingly keep) with programming skills I taught myself.
 I know most of the basics regarding RSA, PGP, and assorted single pass (?) cyphers. One thing I do not understand has to do with how RSA sieves large primes, etc. That is one of the few things that I do not understand about RSA. Another aspect of RSA I do not understand is the usage of primes (or any number) in the actual encryption process. Does the program add numbers from the key to the plaintext to create the cyphertext, or does it use some other process.
I am sorry if any of these questions seem redundant and/or
stupid, but at this point in time, I can't get my hands on any actual explanation for how it works. (I would get a
copy of "Applied Cryptography," but I do not have any
source of income, which also explains Juno.)
Aiieee!!! the dreaded "J" word!
Once again, I apologize if any of this caused annoyance
or sickness.

@_subject: An old _Discover_ article explaining RSA 
I had found this article in an issue of Discover I've had for a few
years. It is a comic strip-type article by Larry Gonick article
in Layman's terms, the very basics of RSA. This article was
printed in the April 1992 issue of Discover magazine (some liberties
taken regarding pictures, etc.).

You could also go one step further and leave out all
references that it was encrypted, (I think this was
discussed in a stego thread.) then when asked (told)
to decrypt it, say:
"Decrypt what? It looks like gibberish to me."

@_subject: rival Clipper products 
What somebody needs to do is make a rival for
Clipper products. I propose that somebody with
enough money should have a Clipper-type chip
implementing Triple-DES or whatever developed
and marketed. They should do the same things,
except not be restricted by the government
(obviously this wouldn't be for export) by the means
of using weak crypto. These devices could probably
be marketed to the same audience that Clipper
products are aimed at, i.e. the general unsuspecting
populace. The only problem I could see would be
educating whoever buys into how the government
is pulling the wool over their eyes. I'm sure with
some funding from a major source, or some
donation of time/supplies from a manufacturing
company, it could be pulled off in grand fashion.
Who said we can't play the government's little game?
This along with some "Big Brother Inside" stickers
massively propagated, and it might fly. Any insights?

@_subject: [NOISE] About piracy & key recovery / hacked pages & Clinton-Gore 
Hmmm... let's see... At about the same time
I see people talking about major software/hardware
companies going into the key recovery biz and
piracy sites _not_ getting taken off of servers (SPA).
Piracy. Software companies. Don't they have a
common bond somewhere? Wouldn't it be ironic
if a rash of piracy occurred with said companies
products being pirated?
I also noticed two other parallels: Hacked web pages
and (although not here) the Clinton/Gore re-election.
Hmm... Didn't somebody say something about
the real Dole page getting a lot of hits? Maybe the
Clinton page gets a lot of hits too. Wouldn't that be a
hoot if somebody hacked their page and changed it
to something more meaningful, say, how they are
pushing the terribly dangerous key-recovery project.
Even a subtle hack, such as putting a link to national
and international sites carrying PGP, would have an
