My camels don't understand/can't eat fractional bananas.
My first camel put 2000 bananas at 200 miles then 1001 bananas at 533 miles then
left 1 banana at mile 533 and sprinted for home,
arriving with 533 bananas
My second camel put 2000 bananas at 200 miles then 1001 bananas at 533 miles then
ate 1 banana at mile 533 and found the energy to move the  1000 bananas to mile 534 and
sprinted for home,
arriving with 534 bananas
My third camel put 2000 bananas at 200 miles then 1001 bananas at 533 miles then
ate 1 banana at mile 533 and found the energy to move the
1000 bananas to mile 534 and
sprinted for home,
arriving with 535 bananas figuring he'd pay for his last mile with credit.
My fourth camel,
the biggest strongest camel,
was already waiting at the destination and
charged each of the other camels a
50% banana tax, rounded up to the nearest banana,
plus a 10 banana collection fee
and left with 832 bananas and didn't have to do
anything but paperwork while
the other camels were now short of
bananas and
had to find a new way to get more
