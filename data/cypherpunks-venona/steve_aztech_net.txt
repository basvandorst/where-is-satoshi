away from a star configuration to something closer to a backbone with multiple
physical subnets (say, per floor.)  How do you keep your next door neighbor
from sniffing your traffic on the same subnet?  Encrypt it, silly...  For
performance reasons, truly local traffic could be in the clear, but traffic
between the clients' routers and the ISP's would run through something that
could keep up with the ISP's max throughput on the ISP's outside interface.
You might read "Firewall with encrypted tunnels" for "router" in the paragraph
above.  If you do, then you have the infrastructure for supporting "secure"
trans-Internet traffic.
Of course we're not talking about $25.00/mo. service with a $50.00 setup anymore, but low-ish priced, "secure" 56Kb/s, fractional T1, T1, and even T3
seem to be where corporate America/Earth wants to go.

I'd be interested in seeing your numbers and cost breakdowns.  I'd really be
interested in the up-front costs that would be associated with the equipment
and set-up time/training that will help "insure" data privacy over wideley
broadcast media.  The up-front costs for ~T1 capable tranceivers isn't
insignificant either.  I figure ~$10K up front (maybe half of that, maybe twice
when you include management overhead)  Amortize  over 3 years, and compare.
All of this is assuming that the bandwidth is available on the airwaves to
handle ~200 ~T1s.  (If we're talking $200.00/mo. for T1, sign me up tomorrow,
and my neighbor, and his, and hers, and...  *poof* no more bandwidth in a
"decently" populated metro area or even a downtown.  (Back of the envelope
calculations show that ~200 T1 ~= 1 TV station [although I might be off by an
order of magnitude.])
I apologize if this is off topic, but the crypto part still applies (moreso,
even!) to broadcast over the airwaves.  (Besides, I'm sure that this list has
enough subscribers that are shelling out $200-$500/mo. for 56K/Frac T1/ISDN
that they'd be interested in a less expensive alternative.)

# It's hard.  I'd really rather have longer pass{words,phrases} so that there's
# the potential for lots of entropy without requiring line-noise for passwords.
One of the ideas that I've been kicking around in the back of my head for a
while for stronger, easier to uses user authentication goes something like
1) User enters a pass-phrase.
2) System "tokenizes" the pass-phrase.
   The tokenization would probably include a normalization step: condensing
   white-space and punctuation, standardizing the casing of words, perhaps    even going so far as converting 3133+ speak to something readable.
   Once normalized, the pass-phrase would be parsed, and tokenized.  It would
   be useful to have a large system-wide dictionary, sorted by how common a    given word or group of words is normally used in the most commonly used    languages that the system's users speak/write.  Any word or group of words
   found in the dictionary would be converted to a number, representing its
   position in the dictionary, and the significant bits of that number are    concatenated to a running bit string.  Words and tokens not found in the
   dictionary would pass through some other algorithm that I haven't thought
   too much about, yet.
3A) System examines the tokenized pass-phrase against another (probably _very_
    large) dictionary of common phrases for acceptability.  (maybe just
    comparing the hashes of the phrases [smaller dictionary])
    System also examines the "length" of the tokenized pass-phrase for     acceptability (for pass-phrase changes.)
3B) System hashes the tokenized pass-phrase, and compares it against the
    previously stored hash (for authentication.)
    [ Standard crypt(3) stuff ]
Ignoring the fact that strong one-time-passwords are orders of magnitude better, what would something like this buy you?
0) "Good" pass-phases should be more difficult to brute-force or inteligently
    attack than simple (8 or 16 byte) passwords.  [ rm /usr/local/bin/crack ]
1) Pass-phrases are generally easier to remember than system-generated
   passwords.  [ no more post-its pasted to screens or hidden under keyboards
   with passwords written on them. ]
2) Pass-phrases can be a pain to type in correctly, the normalization step
   should help in this regard.  [ happier users ]
3) Enforcement of selecting good pass-phrases is difficult.  This scheme
   addresses _some_ of the issues involved.  [ The next generation of 'crack'
