DEMOCRACY.NET CYBERCAST DRAWS THOUSANDS TO INTERACTIVE CONGRESSIONAL HEARING
democracy.net, a project designed to explore ways of enhancing citizens
participation in the democratic process via the Internet, held its first
live, interactive cybercast of a Congressional hearing on Wednesday March
19th, 1997.
Thousands of Internet users joined this historic event by listening to a
live audio feed from the hearing (cybercast over the Internet via
RealAudio), submitting questions and testimony for the hearing record, reading
information about the hearing, and joining a simultaneous online discussion
forum to discuss the hearing with Congressional staff and policy experts.
The hearing was held by the Senate Commerce Committe to consider S. 377,
the Promotion of Commerce online in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act and this
issue of US encryption policy -- a critical issue to the Internet user
Some statistics from the event.
* 6,019 individual Internet users visited the democracy.net web site
  containing information about the Hearing, links to both sides of the
  issue, and other relevant information in the 24 hours preceding the
  event.
* 703 individuals listened to the hearing live online via Real Audio
  throughout the 3 hour event.  The actual Senate hearing room (Russell
  253) where the event took place only holds less than one hundred people
  when filled to capacity (as it was for this hearing).
* Throughout the event, between 20 - 50 people joined the simultaneous
  live chat discussion where Commerce Committee staff and encryption
  policy experts fielded questions and discussed the hearing.  The
  audience included individual Internet users, reporters, advocacy
  groups, and Congressional staff.
* Twenty-three Internet users submitted formal comments for the hearing
  record via the democracy.net web page, including IETF chair Fred Baker.
The democracy.net cybercast was promoted on the front page of Netscape's
World Wide Web site (one of the most popular destinations on the entire
Web) on March 18 - 19. The site is also featured at Progressive Networks
WebActive Site of the Week for the week of March 17-21.
Despite some technical bugs early on (par for the course for a cutting-edge
Internet event such as this), the cybercast went even better than we
anticipated. We are grateful to Brett Scott, Mike Rawson, Matt Raymond,
Mike Inners, and Pia Pialorsi of the Senate Commerce Committee staff for
their help and support of this effort.
Archives of the hearing are posted democracy.net is a new project of the Center for Democracy and Technology
and the Voters Telecommunications Watch designed to explore ways of
enhancing citizen particpation in the democratic process via the Internet.

   Members of Congress love to hear from their constituents. If you have
   friends that live in the district, please forward this invitation and
   encourage them to attend.
3. Make sure you have the right software
   To participate in the chat, you will need two pieces of software besides
   a Web browser.  To listen to the   "We need to send a clear, unscrambled message to Washington that our
   nation's encryption policy needs to be reformed, and reformed now."
               -- Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), SAFE Forum, July 1, 1996
Given the 14th District's concentration of high-tech industries, it is
not surprising that Rep. Eshoo serves on the House Committee on
Commerce. Her subcommittee assignments on this committee include the
Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection, as
well as the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment.  The Commerce
Committee has policy making  power over high technology, biotechnology,
public health, and the environment.
Through her seat on the Commerce Committee, Rep. Eshoo is well positioned
to assist high technology interests in her district. She fought hard to
ensure that securities litigation reform and telecommunications reform
were signed into law. Rep. Eshoo has introduced the Online Parental
Control Act to fight government censorship and encourage parents to use
technology to control their children's access to online materials. She
has led the fight to improve the Food and Drug Administration's product
review process and played an instrumental role in securing the $238
million B Factory for the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
In addition, Rep. Eshoo has pushed to loosen costly export controls on
high technology products, make NASA contractors more liable for the
costs of failing to comply with their contract requirements, and
prevent government laboratories from competing with private industry.
She also played a key role in stopping the Financial Accounting
Standards Board from adopting a rule requiring businesses to charge
stock options against earnings, a move which could have seriously
curtailed the growth of small firms and start-up businesses,
particularly in the high technology industry.

over eight times as many people (804) listened to the RealAudio archive
than could have fit into the room at the hearing itself!
The hearing transcript continues to be extremely popular, with the
testimony of Jim Barksdale (CEO, Netscape) and  Louis Freeh (Director,
FBI) counting as the two most popular hearing witnesses to listen to.
Over a quarter of our visitors to the hearing archives stop to listen
to Barksdale and Freeh's takes on the encryption debate.

SIT IN ON LIVE FCC UNIVERSAL SERVICE HEARING: WEDNESDAY MAY 7, 9:30AM ET
The future of Universal Service in the nation's telecommunications network
is one of the key elements of our nation's communications infrastructure.
At issue - how to ensure that citizens who live in rural and inner city
areas have access to advanced telecommunications services, and how to pay
for it.
The 1996 Telecommunications Reform Act directed the FCC to answer these
questions.  After nearly a year of investigation, hearings, and public
comment, the FCC will announce its rules on Wednesday May 7th.
You can join the proceeding live.
Be present, ask questions, and get answers from FCC staff after the
hearing. (FCC staff are not allowed to comment on a matter before the
Commission before the commissioners have made their ruling.)
Best of all, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt will join democracy.net on Tuesday May
13 for an online town hall meeting.  Hundt will discuss the Universal
Service proceeding and respond to questions from Internet users.

INTERNET CAUCUS FIELD HEARING @ LIBRARY OF CONGRESS: TUE MAY 13,
    3-5PM EASTERN
One of the most crucial benefits of the Internet is it's ability to
allow government agencies to publish information to the public at a
very low cost.  Numerous examples of how the Internet has
revolutionized access to the democratic process and government exist
today, including:
* The Library of Congress' THOMAS service ( which
  makes available bills and speeches from the Congressional Record,
* The Federal Communications Commission's Daily Digest and Website    ( which allows citizens to track every issue
  moving through the agency's processes, and
* The National Aeronautics and Space Association's Website (
  which has made available photos and other astronomical images available to the
  very taxpayers that funded them.
These projects and others like them have fundamentally changed the way
Americans today keep tabs on their government.  But there's still a
long way to go, and this Internet Caucus field hearing will examine
nine examples of how the Internet is being utilized to make the
government more accessible to Americans.
You can attend this event live by listening to the live audio feed,
submit questions to the Senators and Representatives from the Internet
Caucus for the witnesses who will be there, view live photos from the
hearing room, and discuss the issue with Internet users and
Congressional staffers in interactive chat.

JOIN REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA) LIVE ONLINE TUESDAY JUNE 3, 8:30 PM ET
Who is Congressman Bob Goodlatte?  Depending on your point of view, the
Republican Congressman from Virginia is either a steadfast champion of
online privacy, or a supporter of censorship in cyberspace.
This year, Rep. Goodlatte has been leading a successful charge to
overturn the Clinton administration's encryption control policies.
Goodlatte is the principal author of H.R. 695, "The Security and Freedom
through Encryption (SAFE) Act." -- a bill designed to promote privacy
and security on the Internet by encouraging the widespread availability
of encryption technology.  Goodlatte's efforts to protect privacy and
prohibit the government from imposing "key-escrow" and
"key-recovery" domestically have won him praise from Internet users.
The SAFE bill was recently approved by the House Judiciary Committee
(the first time an encryption reform bill has ever cleared a major
Congressional committee), and is now headed to the House International
Relations Committee where a tougher fight is expected.
But in 1995, Rep. Goodlatte was a leading supporter of the
Communications Decency Act (CDA) -- a law which for the first time
imposed broad content regulations on the Internet.  The CDA is currently
being reviewed by the Supreme Court and a decision is expected before
the end of June.
Join Congressman Goodlatte for a live, Virtual Town Hall meeting and
find out what makes him tick.
You can submit questions in advance by visiting
 The discussion will be moderated by Todd
Lappin, Section Editor at Wired Magazine.
