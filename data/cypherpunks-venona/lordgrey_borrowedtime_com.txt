COBOL would let you practice putting periods at the end of statements.  Learn two things at once!
More seriously, code written in C, C++ and Perl is in demand.  There's a better chance that more people can maintain or update your code than if it was written in a less mainstream language, and customers tend to appreciate that.  Out of those three, Perl is probably the best introductory language.
