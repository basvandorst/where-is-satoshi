@_subject: Photoshop, Steganograhy, and cypherpunks? 
The new version of Photoshop coming out this fall includes the ability to
embed "digital watermarking":
(from                  Digital watermarking
                adds copyright information to
                a photograph that doesn't alter the photo's
                appearance. The watermark is detectable even
                after the photo is edited or printed and rescanned. Question: Will stegonagrphying (?) the picture with noise mar the
watermark? Will a digital signature *and* something embedded into the
graphic through steganography seriosly affect a 24-bit image?
Furthermore: What about browsers? Could cookies or binary info be embedded
into images on the fly so that a java applet could preserve information or
states between pages, of different sites?
Just thoughts..

Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but could this lead to
"engineering" the market at particularly times of the year to decrease the
"official" value of an entity's value and complicating the pricing of
equities? Would this become a viable means for those with less wealth to
capitalize on the momentary "dip" in prices?

@_subject: Re: Snooping ISP admin?? 
As someone who has operated an ISP himself, I would say that the
likelihood of this being a system problem is very high. Especially if this
is a relatively new ISP, or if they've upgraded anything at all on their
mail server, it's pretty easy to break the delicate balance of daemons and
permissions such that this problem could easily occur.
It's worth a call to their technical support line (I know.. I'm sure it's
always busy) just to inform them of the problem. Sometimes it'll time out
(if it's one kind of problem) and sometimes it'll hang there until a lock
file is specifically removed (a different kind of problem).
All other comments regarding the likelihood that a sysadmin would try to
read mail in the real environment apply.
