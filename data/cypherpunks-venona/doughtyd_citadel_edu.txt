I've tried to normal unsub.  It didn't work.  Can someone please take me
off?  Thanks and sorry this had to go out.

When sending mail to cypherpunks-request, Eric has to read them and
alter the subscription requests himself, and sometimes he gets a few
days behind.  A little patience will save you from having to announce
your intent to depart to the entire list.  Thank you.

well from what I have read, an observer watched as one of the members
loaded a program, called a local telephone system, (the utility was a phone
utility produced by the phone company) and then whala he could hear the people voices or if data he could watch it scroll down his menu.  I was
amazed when I heard this.  No tech available but I thought I should
mention that it was a hardware utility available through the modem.
