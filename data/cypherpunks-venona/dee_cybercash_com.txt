DNS security is an important point.  People not aware of efforts in this
area may want to check out draft-ietf-dnssec-secext-05.txt which has
more or less passed working group last call and is being considered by
th Security Area Directory / IESG.  Reference code is also available

Earlier versions of the dsn-security draft did have a revocation mechanism
but the overwhelming consensus in the dns-security working group was to leave
that out of the first version.  I have on my queue writing up my ideas in
this area a separate draft.  Feel free to write up yours. Donald E. Eastlake 3rd     +1 508-287-4877(tel)     dee

The customer has a private key.  Customer info on their machine is
encrypted under a password.
Billing address establishment is part of shopping.  It need not be
the card billing address.  But the customer needs to enter an
addreess when setting up their credit card. see
in any of the IETF shadow directories.
The customer signs the message including the merchant id and order id
before encrypting a bunch of stuff including the credit card number
to send to the merchant.  There isn't anything useful to steal from
the ecnrypted part of that message.

The current plans include a way to link your CyberCash persona with
a bank account (DDA).  If you have done that and there is cash in
your CyberCash persona, you would be able to transfer it to the bank
account.  Using ACH, this operation typically happens overnight.

You comment is sufficiently short and cryptic that it's a bit hard to
tell what your point is.  Different services are good for different
things.  Most of the merchant's signed up with CyberCash currently
sell hard goods that they phsically ship to you.  They have different
needs from the on-line information vendors that FV primarily serves
at this time.
But both CyberCash and, I understand, FV plan to expand their service
repertoire. If you want to use your credit card or bank account via CyberCash, you
need to go though an authentication step to link them.  If you don't
want to use a credit card or bank account, there is no requirement
to provide any real identity information when you set up a CyberCash

Suggest you look at draft-eastlake-internet-payment-*.txt in the
IETF shadow directories.  I don't think any one step will solve all
our spam problems but I wouldn't mind spending, say, 5 cents for each real piece of mail I sent outside my company and if end machines charged 5 cents per piece of ouside mail received, I think spamming would be crippled.  (Note that with bad guy lists, you could collect the money and then just throw away the mail.)

In physics there are various conservation laws: conservation of energy,
mass, charge, and whatnot. You all know about this... Conservation of mass
says that mass is neither created nor destroyed. (For smart aleck
quibblers, conservation of mass-energy.)
How does this relate to our issues?
"Abuse of Resources": Mail loops, infinite loops, spamming, overloads of
networks, and congestion in general are cases where "unrealistic" models of
costs are implemented in software. In the real physical world, infinite
loops don't occur (at least not in the sense seen with mail loops, as a
relevant example.)
Conservation laws are related to the "cost model" of the universe. Real
physical objects have costs, or ontological status, or presence.... (Please
don't read too much into this point...I mean to be suggestive, not
There are no "memory leaks" in the universe which suddenly fill it up with
stuff, no perpetual motion machines, no creation and destruction of
Cyberspace Ontologies: There are several things which need to be done to
make the cyberspatial world more like the spatial world:
* payment for CPU cycles consumed (via contractual, permission-based
access: "If you want access to this machine, here are the terms and
* metering mechanisms, such as e-stamps for e-mail (essentially a special
case of the first point, where a machine says "I'll pass on your message if
you pay me to.")
* digital contracts, agreements on usage and payment  (resource auctioning,
or the "smart contracts" that Nick Szabo has written about)
(you can all think of additional examples....)
Cryptographic protocols have their uses here, but there are also some other
measures which bear looking into. In the LISP community, for example, work
has been done on "engines," which are building blocks that are "fueled up"
with "CPU fuel" and allowed to run for some amount of CPU cycles. Thus, one
could put an engine into a process and it would run for some number of
ticks, then stop.
(I'm sure there are Unix-level tools which do similar things, in terms of
giving a spawned process so many ticks of the clock. The "engines" concept
is somewhat more semantically clean, in that it's pushed down into the
"ontology" of the thing being simulated or run, and is not at the "God
level" (to use a non-technical term!).)
Now, certainly I support the right of any person or machine to run programs
freely and without charge, to pass on e-mail free of charge, to run
remailers for no charge, to accept spam mail without complaint, and so on.
What I'm suggesting is that many of the problems being seen with overuse of
resources, spam, congestion, and denial of service are really due to a poor
model of resource allocation. Unix and other modern operating systems offer
various tools for helping to constrain such problems, but, I submit, better
methods are needed.
(Especially when multiple machines, networks, and even anonymous sites are
part of the overall system....clearly the constraints must be managed
locally, and via "contract," as part of a computational ecology, and not as
a hierarchical, top down Unix-type operating system.)
Economics is about the "allocation of scarce resources." Many of the
existing models being used treat various scarce resources as _free_. Then,
when the inevitable problems occur, calls for top-down regulation are heard
(e.g., the frequent calls for illegalization of "unwanted mail").
In my view, building a consistent, distributed, "conservative" system is
what Cypherpunks need to be thinking about.
(I used the term "conservative" in the physics sense. A system in which
various conservation laws are obeyed.)
As I said before, this should not be compelled, but voluntary. However,
those who give their resources away for free (choosing not to adopt a
conservative ontology, in other words) should be in no position to complain
or run to the government for top-down regulation because there freely-given
resources are being overused or "abused" (in their thinking).
And closely related to this whole issue--and something I've written about
extensively--is the issue of "building walls in cyberspace." In the real
world, persistent structures are build out of real materials, resulting in
castles, forts, skyscrapers, bridges, houses, highways, etc. These objects
have persistence, have controllable access (gates, doors, locks,...), and
have "structural integrity."
Cryptographic and distributed trust protocols are about the only means I
can think of for constructing the equivalents in cyberspace. (And to a
large extent, this is already happening: the Net and the Web have structure
which cannot be demolished casually, or by top-down orders from any single
national leader. Millions of machines, linked in various ways and
implementing various protocols and "terms of service" with users and other
machines....an early version of the "conservative" system I think we'll
someday see.)
Well, this gives the flavor of my points. I haven't rigorously argued all
of the points, but the Cypherpunks forum is for presenting informal

No, I wouldn't be willing to pay $50.00 to have sent that message to
cypherpunks.  But I would certainly have been willing to pay some smaller
non-zero amount, like a dollar (and then there is the question of the
entities I blind copied it to ...).  But I never claimed that charging was
the answer to everying or compatible with the cypherpunks anarchy.  It just
seems like a useful tool to have available.  Based on (hopefully secure)
message characteristics, you want to encourage some mail and probably give it
extra priority, other mail you might want to charge a penny or two for, and
known junk sources you want to charge as much as you can and then trash the
mail.  Probably remailers should sign messages so you can easily configure to
let their mail in if you want to get it.  But there should still be appropriate social and legal action against network abusers as well. Donald E. Eastlake 3rd     +1 508-287-4877(tel)     dee
