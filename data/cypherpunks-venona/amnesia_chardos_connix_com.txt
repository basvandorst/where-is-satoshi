The web of trust just certifies that the key belongs to someone.  If
you'd read to the end of the message, you would have seen that I was
not complaining about the key certification process in PGP.  At issue is
NOT whether a key can be trusted to belong to someone, but whether or
not random people should be able to tag others' PGP keys with crap.
What I want to prevent is some person I dislike uploading his
signature on my key (particularly if he adds another ID to my key and
signs that).
How would you like it if I added a new ID to your key containing sort
of insult, certified that ID, and uploaded the new signature to the
key servers.  Alternatively, what if I uploaded 5 "vanity" keys in
your name to the PGP key servers.  Most software would download one
key, fail to certify the signature, and therefore not allow someone to
communicate with you even if that person could have verified your real
I don't understand what the purpose of a centralized key server is,
when the owner of a public key should be the one to control what
certificates and tags are given out with his/her PGP key.

Going into a bank can lead to casing out the joint, which may lead to
a heist.  Should this make the posession of pictures of banks illegal?
I don't think that anyone here is advocating kiddie porn.  The problem
that TCM pointed out is that in fighting kiddie porn, legislators
have started banning _thoughts_ that _could_ lead to child abuse.
This is one great leap forward into the police state.
You're seeing the trees and missing the forest.  It could be
any activity, say the abuse of animals, that winds up being
used as a wedge to create the police state.
If the government started tatooing red 'P's on the foreheads of
convicted pedophiles, would anyone notice the irony?

Clinton. Dole is now an even-longer shot than before, and Perot
is back on the table at Ladbrokes, though William Hill is still
giving a better deal on him. Here are the latest odds from your
roving UK reporter. I'll try to develop a nym by next post, in
case you are interested in corresponding.

Coral, another national firm in the same business, expects to be
offering odds shortly. (+44-345-581527). Local bookmakers said to
be laying off (and putting on a hefty markup!). No explanation so
far for the lack of odds on longer-shot candidates Browne, Nader,
Hagelin, Phillips, etc. as these would all seem to be pure profit
to the oddsman, but I am not in the gambling business. Oh well.

Well, now Ladbroke House is not even selling Clinton, and he has gone
up from 1:8 to 1:10 at William Hill, while Dole fell a bit more, and
just *look* at the William Hill Perot odds, doubling from last time!
Wide disparity there, as Ladbroke's is still holding steady at 50:1 on
the little guy, now that they're offering him again. Still no odds yet
from Coral, and the nym's giving troubles, and still no offer -- or
official explanation for the lack of odds -- on Harry Browne. I suppose
folks can keep speculating, still seems like easy money for the house
to the oddsman.

Our roving reporter had the following to say:
   "Looks like you're getting trouser-brain back !      :-)"
I suppose so, we get the government we deserve. The oddsman wishes to
thank all involved, and he is still looking for a Moscow correspondent
for possible UK arbitrage opportunities. :> Thanks also to all who are
"in the know" for not revealing my identity. 'Till next time.
