Barring a _severe_ breakthrough in the entire nature of computing, you still
need at least 1 atom to store one bit of information.  It would take more
computing power than all the atoms in the world, with the ability to store 1 bit
on a atom and other dazzling feats of miniaturization, to crack a 2048 bit key
barring algorithmic breakthrough.
I'm sorry, but barring the severe breakthrough mentioned, Moore's Law will break
when we are storing single atoms as bits.  Or perhaps single electrons (spin,
but how the hell do you hold them in place for reading??), but the point still
stands.  Quantum computing might fill the void, but then, quantum computing
might make all Crypto thus far irrelevant anyways.

That's not nescessary, actually.  All you need is for the mint to put _no_
information at with the coin except it's serial number and a signatrue
(possibly a timestamp as well).  Voila, anonymity.  I was thinking of
implementing a low-cost server ofthis type, but there's the trust problem: this
nym is relatively new...
There might be other reasons for this:  have you looked at their _fees_???
Holy crap!  That's the only reason I don't have an account.  They're charging
top dollar for every aspect of a system that has it's only overhead in minimal
amounts of CPU time.  I was thinking of having my server charge only on
deposit of real money and only a tiny amount (like 1-2%).  I.e. no charge at
all to open an account to recieve money...

One assumes you are reffering to the wild west again?
Regardless, a point about the wild west:  I have it from a fairly reliable
source that in teh entire time period labeled 'The Wild West', there were about
8 shooting deaths in Dodge City (a particularily 'Wild' town), of which 5 were
shotgun deaths....  Makes you wonder.
I also have a pointer to an excellent, well researched US paper on why gun
control is bad, if anyone wants it, but it's been posted here before I'm pretty

It won't change dick all as long as it's got that nice (TM) beside it, which I

Boy, you're a fucking loser.
Hacking = expert/geeky computer usage.
Cracking = breaking into computer systams.
Phranking = some stupid fucking word you made up.
Cryptomography = some other stupid fucking word you made up.
So, you use 4 major terms, get two of them wrong, and can't use basic grammar.
Even if I know the first thing about cracking (which I don't), I would never
teach you that or anything else in a million years because you are obviously too
stupid to be worth wasting my time on.
Hell, you're even too stupid to troll well, if that's what this is...

Is this because of the mathematical mistakes, or is there other stuff? Certainly
his 'real-world' grasp seems excellent, and it's an enjoyable read, which says a
whole hell of a lot, I think, given the topic.  I got an ad for 'The Handbook of Applied Cryptography' from a conference, is it
any good?

I've looked at this, there are two problems:
1. The message is in [A-Za-z0-9!@ ASCII.  The translation scheme
is undisclosed.
2. The message is, apparently, compressed to some proprietary standard.
So, someone's going to have to hack disassembly to get this message into binary.
Once that's done, we can start bruting it.

No, actually, they're fine.  Except that they penalize the merchant mroe than
the customer, which I find stupid in a tech as new as this.
Hrmm... Well, It appears I lied.  Here's the _other_ reasons why might not still
get an MTB account (although I might anyways, with some creative form filling):
1.  Lack of real anonymity.  Feh.  Nuff said.
2.  Cleint software.  You should be able to do e-cash with e-mail if you want
3.  Lack of code avalability.  Although this is improving.
4.  Chaumian blind signatures. OK, the guy's smart, but I've heard over and over
I asked before, but no-one answered:
Would any of you be interested in an e-cash that didn't have any of the points
above working against it?  Although, obviously, client softare could be writtent
ot facilitate things.
As I said before, the mint does not need to store identity-related info with the
list of coins.  With an e-mail based system and the remailers, you can be _sure_
this is not taking place.
