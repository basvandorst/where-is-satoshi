I wouldn't worry about either.  I don't see how enforcement of  copyright will be possible under crypto-anarchy any more than  taxation will be.  If one person pays for a posting, what's to keep  him from sharing it anonymously with whomever he wants?  Is there any  way that crypto-anarcy won't bring the death of "intellectual

standard DES
Hmm...  I can't figure out what it would mean to cube time.  For  two-key (112 bit) triple DES, it should be 2^56 times longer to  exhaustively search the keyspace, with three keys, 2^112 times  longer.  This assumes the keysearch engine is pipelined, so each  trial encryption takes the same amount of time, despite the  additional rounds.  Such a machine would cost more, of course, since  it would have a longer pipeline, but wouldn't otherwise be  significantly different in design.
Back-of-the-envelope calculation:  a design like the "7-hour  exhaustive keysearch" engine for 2-key triple DES would take 50  trillion years or so to exhaust the keyspace.  That's for a cost on  the order of $1 million (it should be buildable for less than three  times the cost of the 56-bit key version).
Seems secure, but as Perry says,

Hmmm.  Couldn't digicash issuers simply charge up front

let the merchants redeem it for free.  Sound okay?

Chilling thought:  strnlght
A subscriber to Washington-based Digital Express recently asked on  the digex.general group that the cypherpunks list be gatewayed to a  newsgroup there, too.  It hasn't shown up there, and I hope it  doesn't.  Mailing lists just "feel" a little more private, and their  central administration makes possible some control over abusers.
Has anyone sent mail to postmaster or news to ask them what  they're doing?  I'd feel a little funny doing so myself, since I'm  not a subscriber.  I have asked Digex not to gateway the list,

In my experience, mass key-signing on a few laptops is a waste of  time.  It might be a fun waste of time at a convention, but it made  the one Washington Cypherpunk meeting to date kind of a drag.  Far  more efficient is to print up a paper certificate with your key and  its fingerprint, run off a bunch of copies, and sign them.  Pass them  out and let people verify your credentials; everyone does a batch  signing when they get some free time.  Then everyone mails their key  ring to a server, waits a few days, and collects all their new  signatures off the same server.
But, again, maybe that takes the fun out of it.  To each his own...
