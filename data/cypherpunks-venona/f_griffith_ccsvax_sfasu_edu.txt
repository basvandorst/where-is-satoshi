@_subject: digital cash/legal tender 
Legal tender is a quality given by government to certain forms of
money such that a creditor who refuses to accept that money in payment
of a debt loses certain rights (e.g. to collect further interest.
In our system, federal reserve notes are legal tender,your personal
check is not.
  It is acceptability, not government edict wich makes something
money. (Note the development of NOW accounts, e.g.).
  Credit cards are not money.  When you use a credit card, you are
promising to pay in the future.  The merchant sells this promise to
the credit card issuer.
  In order for electronic money to be true cash, it must be able to
circulate from Alice to Bob to Carl to Dave without the need to
contact the issuing bank.  Otherwise, it is merely an electronic
check, perhaps anonymous.  If Bob must deposit or validate the
money first in order to make sure Alice doesn't double spend it,
then it is no different from Alice having $200 in her checking
account and writing a $150 check to Bob and a $150 check to Carl.
The first one who gets it to her bank collects, the other one has
it bounced back.

peb:if a currency loses reputation (value) people will switch to a
better reputation (value) currency (paraphrase)
Greshams law: "bad money drives out good"
i.e. where people have a choice (e.g. gold vs greenbacks post Civil
War), in making payments, they will use the lesser value money and
keep the higher value.  Thus, the lesser value money will circulate,
the higher value money will not.

@_subject: re:backing 
Aug/Sept 93 Mother Earth News has an article "The Ultimate Barter" about
"A currency based on time-hours is a boon to a rural community."
Depends on legal tender status (see post by Perry).  Note too his
point that digital currency needn't be poorly backed.  However, also note
that government issued dollars would circulate in preference to gold
backed digital currency issued by someone else according to Greshams law (which was stated in reference to metal coins, but applies to
other forms as well).
Solution might be to denominate digital currency in something other
than $ (e.g. gold grams) & have parallel monetary system develop.

This is another thread only slightly related to cypherpunks.
I find the paranoid reaction to the "Religious Right" strange.  Perhaps
it is based on relying on the establishment media for a picture of it.
Would you rely on such media to give you an accurate picture of what
the government is doing with cryptography or of teh need for gun control?
The media picture of the Religious Right is just as distorted.
The right to encryption and the "right" to abortion don't have the same
basis - encryption kills no one.

@_subject: Re: Warrantless searches -- A sign of things to come? 
I thought the administration had backed off the original proposal because
of the uproar and had gone to the search waiver provision in the rental
agreement (don't know if they included the firearms part).
It appears that we're still at a point where enough protest from the
informed part of the populace can have an effect.

I got a copy in the mail in January and couldn't tell much difference
from how it was several years ago.  This might be because I was already
familiar with their themes - someone who hadn't seen it before might
not have recognized what lay behind some of their stuff.

@_subject: Re: The Value of Money 
Actually, there is no connection between the gold and our money.  I.e.
you cannot take US $ to Fort Knox (or any other government location) and
get gold for it.
This is why some posters have referred to "fiat money" - the $ is money
because the government says it is.

Right!  All redemption promises were repudiated.  Gold in 1933, silver
somewhat later.

Roosevelt eliminated domestic convertibility 1n 1933.
Nixon eliminated international convertibility ("closed the gold window"
as it's often stated) in August, 1971.
The dollar was devalued from 1/35 oz of gold to 1/38 oz in December,
The dollar was devalued from 1/38 oz to 1/42.22 oz in Feb, 1973.
Of course, the devaluations didn't really matter since even the international convertibility ha been eliminated.

Wouldn't it be better to have a patched version of 2.5?  Wouldn't
this remove the questions about legal use in the U.S.?

I think it's Cede & Co.
The original reason, which may not still hold, was that it was rather
cumbersome to transfer securities held in the name of a corporation,
much easier to transfer those in a partnership's name.  Thyus, the clearing corp formed a partnership to hold the securities.
