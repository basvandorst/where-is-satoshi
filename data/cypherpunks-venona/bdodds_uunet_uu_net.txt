especially when 1Tb fiber is in practice - our phone calls will take only nanoseconds! :)
anything included in that as to why they used a dfb laser for channel 16? or is it something obvious i'm missing? i notice they're still using the encyclopedia/second benchmark..

a friend of mine once said his 486 (when most of us were on 286's) was so fast it would process commands before he typed them..
well, maybe we should update this measure to meet the range like they did with the bel.. since an encyclopedia per second (eps) is a useless measure, maybe we should institute the mega-encyclopedia per second, or `meps' which would be 1024x30volumes of text.. `this little number over here'll do 30 meps!'..

yes, you're now carrying what the media would call an `assault pda'.. it's small, black, military-styled, and fully automatic.. brian dodds, systems administration, jyacc, inc. wellesley, ma opinions expressed within are not necessarily my own or anyone elses..

@_subject: domain names / f-secure.. 
even that was questionable, there were a rash of copyright infringements a couple of years ago.. the legal holders of the names that were taken had to go to great lengths to get the name, and sometimes could not.. i'm sure you've heard of the toys-r-us vs. roadkill-r-us domain dispute, and how microsoft.com finally `persuaded' micros0ft.com to give it up..
at any rate - has anyone tried out that new f-secure by the folks who brought us f-prot? "military strength internet encryption".. seems to be an encrypted telnet, but i can't replace our server to test it..
