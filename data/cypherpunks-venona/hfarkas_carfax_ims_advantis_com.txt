There is a new O'Reilly book out called _Computer Crime_ that covers the
entire arena in more detail than you'll be likely to ever need.  I hope.
It's decidedly oriented towards the law enforcement community, not
"Computer Folk". Though the title focuses on crime, you'll find what you need here.      Henry W. Farkas      |     Me?     Speak for IBM?     Fat chance.

Oh, I don't know about cheapest.  Electricity costs money.  How does $.32 per day sound to you?  I've come up with a successful algorithm that works like this: I generate a number based upon a random seed.  To get the seed, I mail a letter in exactly the same bin at exactly noon Monday - Saturday at the US Post Office on Orange Street in New Haven, CT.  The letter is always addressed to the exact same recipient.  I simply record the number of days it takes for the letter to arrive.  Guaranteed      Henry W. Farkas      |     Me?
