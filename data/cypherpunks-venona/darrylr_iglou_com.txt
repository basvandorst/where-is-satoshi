The Allegro Group, Inc. has incorporated PGP technology in their Encryption Gateway for Groupwise. Now, the 8.5 million users of Novell GroupWise will be able to send and receive encrypted email and attachments securely and easily. The Encryption Gateway for GroupWise is available on the Windows NT platform and is available as a beta product today. The gateway is a 32-bit application and does not require any additional encryption. It supports keys up to 2048 bits and attachments (including uuEncode and MIME). The gateway works with any PGP or ViaCrypt product and/or key pair, and administrators may customize help and error messages. Now if they can keep this up and get their foot in the door with all the other email vendors.
