 FBI Suspends Lab Whistleblower
 By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
 Associated Press Writer
 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI has suspended a scientist-agent
whose charges led to a still-secret Justice  Department report critical
of some FBI crime lab workers. A Republican senator said Monday
the suspension  ``appears to be a reprisal.''
 The FBI also took action regarding other employees criticized in the
secret report, said officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Three or four employees were transferred out of the FBI lab but not
suspended, these officials said.
 The agent, Frederic Whitehurst, once an FBI crime lab supervisor,
was put on administrative leave with pay Friday afternoon and
barred from entering any FBI building, even as a guest, according to
a letter from Acting Lab Director Donald W. Thompson Jr. The FBI
took Whitehurst's badge and gun, said Whitehurst's lawyer, Stephen
 The action came just days after FBI Director Louis J. Freeh
received a report from the Justice Department's inspector general
that officials said criticizes the work of some FBI lab employees and
a report from a special investigative counsel who looked into an
alleged press leak by Whitehurst.
 Thompson's letter said only that Whitehurst was suspended
``pending our review of information in the possession of the
Department of Justice'' and added that the move ``does not indicate
that you have engaged in any inappropriate conduct.''
 FBI spokesman Bill Carter said the bureau would have a statement
on the matter later.
 Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of a Judiciary
subcommittee on administrative oversight, wrote Freeh on Monday
to demand that FBI officials appear Tuesday in his office to justify
the action against Whitehurst.
 ``Recently, a Department of Justice official knowledgeable about
the IG's investigation told me privately that Dr. Whitehurst had done
a service for his country in bringing forth his information,'' Grassley
 ``The action taken by the FBI implies that he is being punished for
`committing truth.' It appears to be a reprisal for his disclosures,''
Grassley wrote.
 Kohn said that after Whitehurst's allegation about lab misconduct
became known ``he became a lighting rod for other employees to
funnel information to the inspector general.'' Kohn said FBI officials
became ``very, very angry'' when they received the inspector
general's report and learned that ``Whitehurst funneled information
directly from other FBI employees to the inspector general and the
investigation mushroomed beyond what they had expected.''
 Kohn said that was why Whitehurst, once rated by the FBI as its top
expert on bomb residues, was barred from entering FBI buildings
and from getting information from other employees.
 The still-secret inspector general's report is being reviewed by FBI
officials to determine whether any lab employees will be disciplined.
 The inspector general hired a panel of outside scientists to evaluate
the work of the lab after Whitehurst alleged in late 1995 that a pro-
prosecution bias and mishandling of evidence may have tainted
crime lab work or testimony on several high-profile federal cases.
These include the World Trade Center bombing, the mail-bomb
killing of a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer, and the Oklahoma
City federal building bombing.
 Prosecutors have decided not to use at least one lab employee as a
witness in the Oklahoma City bombing case and in a bank robbery
case in Ohio, sources said Monday, apparently to prevent defense
attorneys from using the inspector general report to undermine any
testimony by the employee.
 Stephen Jones, counsel for Timothy McVeigh, who is charged in the
Oklahoma City case, has deposed Whitehurst and indicated he may
be called as a defense witness.
 Nearly a year ago, Whitehurst was called to an interview by Special
Investigative Counsel Joseph C. Hutchison, who was brought here
from the Connecticut U.S. attorney's office to conduct the leak
 investigation.
 Hutchison wrote Whitehurst's lawyers that ``there is substantial
reason to believe that your client ... is responsible for the
unauthorized release of work-related information to Jeff Stein,'' a
freelance writer who produced an article intended for publication in
Playboy magazine.
 At that time, Carl Stern, then Justice Department spokesman, said
Playboy wrote the department to check the article's facts, which
allowed officials to learn that the article would contain information
and allegations about FBI employees that are protected from public
release by the Privacy Act.
 Stern said, ``There is no criminal investigation looking into the
conduct of Frederic Whitehurst. There's an administrative inquiry in
connection with the leak of Whitehurst's communications with the
department to a writer from Playboy magazine.'' E Pluribus Unum - P.O. Box 477; Stockport, OH 43787

Subj:  Rabin story
events surrounding the Rabin assassination and the truth clash publicly.
Early in the month, Maariv's weekend magazine published a remarkable
collection of testimony from seven policemen and security agents on duty at
the assassination scene that fueled suspicions of a conspiracy from many
formerly skeptical readers. On October 18, the author of this piece was the
victim of an eight minute hatchet job on Israel Channel Two Television's
weekend magazine show that was shown again the next night. Despite the
blatant attempt at character assassination, as Yediot Ahronot reported the
Sunday following, I succeeded in igniting renewed national interest in the
possibility that Rabin's murder was not as officially reported.
assassin, Yigal Amir's bullets were real or not. It is not denied by the
Shamgar Commission that "Blanks, blanks," was yelled by someone while Amir's
shot his weapon. The conclusion is that Amir yelled it to confuse Rabin's
bodyguards, a contention he denies. It turns out that more than just
"Blanks, blanks" was shouted.

shouting,`Not real, not real.' I can't say with certainty if it came from
the shooter."
(blanks,blanks) shout. The scene they describe is of a number of people
shouting different phrases. What united the shouters was their belief that
blank bullets were being shot.
"Absolutely certain."
to agree on the number of shots is puzzling but on one issue all agree; none

hurt, a quite inexplicable fact when one considers that he was not merely
hurt but supposedly shot in the lung and spleen by two hollowpoint 9 mm
bullets. However, the "amateur" film of the assassination exonerates the
witnesses. After the film shows the blast from Amir's gun, Rabin is not
pushed forward by the pressure of the bullet, nor does he evince pain.
Rather, he keeps on walking and turns his head quickly to his left.
report on my research on Channel Two. Despite the snow job, one of my points
came across loud and clear and went a long way to keeping my name from being
totally besmirched. I showed the assassination film and pointed out that as
Rabin entered his car, the opposite side passenger door is slammed shut. I
said, the only way the door could be shut was if someone was inside the car
shutting it. This would be in contradiction of the Shamgar report which has
Rabin and Rubin entering an empty car. Channel Two saved my dignity by
saying the door was shut by the vibrations caused by Rabin's entrance.
Throughout the country, people opened their back car doors and started
shaking their vehicles. Nothing could make their doors shut. Further,
Rabin's door was armoured and weighed several hundred more pounds than the
average car door. Add to the facts that the open front door of Rabin's car
did not shut with the back, nor is any shaking of the vehicle in evidence on
the film and you have someone, perhaps the real murderer, waiting for Rabin
inside the car.
November 8, 1995 he was quoted as saying in the New York Times that Rabin's
last words to him in the car were that he was hurt but not seriously. Let's
look what he told the police on the night of the murder and later testified
to the Shamgar Commission and at Yigal Amir's trial.

previous versions he said he wasn't hurt badly or actually helped Rubin to
his feet.
when he enters the car with Rabin. The assassination film shows the opposite
back passenger door being closed from the inside and the other back door
being pushed closed from the outside. Yet Rubin testifies,"We fell onto the
seat together and I slipped between the front and back seat. His legs and
mine were dangling outside as I yelled to the driver,`Get out of here.' He
started driving and I lifted his (Rabin's) and my legs inside and closed the
door. This all took 2-3 seconds."

9:45 to 9:53. With a minute and a half driving time to go, Rabin's driver
Menachem Damti picks up a policeman, Pinchas Terem, to help direct him to
the hospital. Damti, an experienced driver needed no help in finding Ichilov
but even that isn't the main point. With the prime minister dying beside
him, the altruistic Yoram Rubin says to the new passenger, "I'm wounded.
Bandage me." As for Rabin, we can only guess he didn't care that his wounds
needed much more urgent attention. Terem completed his bizarre testimony by
noting that Damti did not notify Ichilov by radio that he was coming and
thus the hospital staff was totally unprepared for Rabin's arrival.

inside the car. Rubin took a harmless arm wound to cover his role in the
event and Damti picked up a policeman as a witness in case of future

honest commission of inquiry. And this hypothetical commission will have to
answer how the back passenger door of Rabin's car really closed as he
entered the vehicle.

The following comments are from Alex Constantine.
Subj: Jon Rappaport's Frauds
        I want you to know I have no faith whatsoever in Rappaport. His
"book" on the CIA and mind control is actually a file of transcripts
compiled by Valerie Wolf, a New Orleans therapist. Rappaport wrote a
five-page introduction, and he has since claimed ad nauseum that he is the
"author" of the book. He is not. He did not even edit it. The material was
used to advance his own career, and published as is. Yet he still claims he
is the book's "author," and never corrects the many introductions in which
he is credited with having "written" the thing. This is a fraud. His book
on the OK bombing has its own problems, among them a reliance on General
Partin of the Birch Society, discussed in my story on Calspan & McVeigh,
and other dubious sources. This is not to say the book is totally false,
but much of it does not check out. Rappaport also fawns over Bo Gritz. Need
I say more?
Robalini's Note: My sole experiences with Jon Rappaport is interviewing him
on the phone and through my work with Jack Herer and the Hemp Legalization
movement.  Thief or not, Rappaport has a good collection of interesting info
he's written about.  As for General Partin and Bo Gritz, I take their
information for what it is worth, and often it is worth a lot.
Also from big Al:
Robalini's Note: Scarlatti's site, whatever the flaws are to it, is a
mindblower, and should be read for that reason alone.  I may add he's been
very encouraging to The Konformist, and I'm certainly going to burn my
bridges with him.  Still, if you, or anyone else, has any specific criticisms
of his (or other) sites, please let me know and I will forward it.  As for
the militas, well, I've never been into running around in the forest with
guns (though it sounds kind of fun), and I suspect much of that crowd would
hate my guts, but I believe they speak a lot of truth, and that their opinion
needs to be heard.  On the OK Bombing, in particular, they have been
admirable in bringing forth evidence that the corporate media has pretended
doesn't exist.  In fact, if I fault militas members for anything, it is that
they don't go far enough in their condemnation of society, and I think it is
odd that a group which is very much anti-government could fawn over the
military (the most powerful arm of the government) so pathetically.  And,
lets face it, racism and homophobia is quite rampant in the milta crowd (as
it is in the rest of society), so I think there is quite a bit of fraudulence
in many members claims of wanting "less government" and being for "freedom".
 But, hey, if I was going to cut off people who's opinion I disagreed with,
I'd be living in a cave.

Subj:  [Fwd: New Internet Tax--Can YOU Afford It?]
You have until tomorrow to protest the new Internet "tax" which the FCC
will be entertaining.  Here is the message which I sent out to everyone
that I could.  I suggest that you spread this message as QUICKLY as
possible.  It is extremely important the FCC be bombarded by messages
and then maybe, just MAYBE, we'll beat this thing!  This is a VERY
SERIOUS ISSUE!!!!  It is extremely important and will determine whether
or not the Internet continues to be available to all of us or just those
who can afford massive fees.  Figure it out, $.10 per minute is $6.00
per hour and this doesn't include your present monthly fees!  Are YOU
going to be willing or able to pay it!
The following is a message which I sent out a week ago.  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is entertaining the
possibility of permitting the telecommunications industry to impose a
per minute charge on Internet Service Providers (ISPs).  This charge
will, obviously, be passed directly on to the user; US!  Needless to
say, this new "tax" will increase the cost of access to the Internet
tremendously!  I strongly believe that this will curtail the growth of
the Internet dramatically.  At a time when access to knowledge and
learning is at an all time high, this additional "tax" will impose an
incredible burden on the average user, to say nothing of very likely
forcing many smaller ISPs out of business.  In addition, this will cause
an extremely adverse affect on the rural user who does not have toll
free access to the larger ISPs, i.e., AOL, Prodigy and others.  If you
feel as I do, drop an Email message to the FCC who has requested
comments.  Their address is:  mailto:isp  You may "click"
directly on the address which will bring up an Email message box in most
programs.  Add your comments, pro or con, and send it off!  Deadline for all comments is Thursday, February 13, 1997!
My message follows.

Subj:  American "Acid Novelist" Brings Home Expatriate Treasure
News Release--For Immediate Distribution--2/12/97
Novelist and psychedelic renegade Todd Brendan Fahey, wit the aid of
his father, a Los Angeles-area health care executive, has purchased from
the Amsterdam art gallery Anton Heyboerwinkel what is believed to be the
bulwark of The Logbook of the Ship _Henry David Thoreau_, an obsessive
and intimate mixed media project of an expatriate American artist/mystic
known pseudonymously as Viktor IV before his drowning death in Amsterdam
in 1986.
While on assignment for _Smoke_ magazine last November, Professor Fahey,
author of the incendiary underground LSD novel _Wisdom's Maw_, claims he
was "directed" to a particular shop on Prinsengracht, a canal
street in downtown Amsterdam; after entering the shop, he was
immediately struck by the idiosyncratic force of the works of a
particular artist.  "It was as if I were being beckoned into Aladdin's
Castle from way out in some super-mall parking lot," says Fahey, of his
experience. "I will never be able to put it into words; but there was a
pull, a connection, and then, after studying the many Logbook pages for
several days in this shop, there came a long moment of illumination."
Fahey describes this "illumination" as an ecstatic vision, in which he
claims to have understood the mystical emphasis of much of the Logbook
"It's not entirely bizarre," says Fahey, who is currently completing his
Ph.D. coursework in English at University of Southwestern Louisiana. "Allen Ginsberg had an experience one day, in his early twenties, where
he heard and witnessed, or believes he did, the voice and personage of
the mystic poet William Blake.  Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote the poem
`Kubla Khan' completely whacked in an opium trance.  I was using
psychedelics pretty heavily during the writing of `Fear & Loathing in
Amsterdam' for _Smoke_, and feel as if I were privileged for a few days
to some kind of Source.  I had many things happen to me in
Amsterdam--very powerful moments of insight and registrations of the
cosmic flow of things--and during one of these moments, it was impressed
upon me from without, that I should bring back to the U.S. these Logbook
drawings of Viktor IV."
Born Walter Karl Gluck, the artist Viktor IV traveled to Amsterdam in
the early 1960s and settled there, leaving on a ship he christened the
_Henry David Thoreau_, after the philosopher who he claimed as his chief
inspiration and muse.  A burly, rugged figure, Viktor IV  was
recognizable amongst the quiet Amsterdam populace as the barefoot
American hippie artist who dressed in black, loved cats and young women,
and worked tirelessly on deeply personal and largely non-commercial
projects aboard his canal-bound ship.
A master scuba diver, Viktor IV drowned in June of 1986, while
performing underwater repairs to the _Henry David Thoreau_.
Todd Brendan Fahey, a novice art collector, perceives in the Logbook
pages the artist's fascination with the "ecstatic vision."  In this way,
he compares the drawings to the poem-paintings of American surrealist
Kenneth Patchen.  "There is that same relentless focus on the
All-At-Once, that so characterizes the experiences of mystics in every
religion and culture.  The rich, interconnectedness of all things.  That
is what Viktor IV is expressing in these pages.  And that is what I was
feeling for much of my stay in Amsterdam; as much as I was really out of
my head most of the time, I was, in another way, very grounded."
Unconcerned with commerce, Viktor IV created hundreds of these Logbook
drawings in the original, with no known professional reproductions, from

ITEM ONE
Rob, Ken is a fellow who had a Dish company south of Dallas and recorded all the network uplink for the whole Waco affair. His tapes were used By Linda Thompson..
If no child died on Feb.28- when was the ATF attack?  Clearly, Koresh,
Snyder, and others conveyed information that children had indeed been injured and or killed.  The physical evidence is overwhelming.  But there remains a question in my mind to this day as to whether the ATF had actually assaulted the place on Feb. 27.  Sound crazy?   It came from ATF commander Ted Royster's mouth first. In his first press briefing, on Sunday afternoon,  Feb. 28, he began (reading from a prepared statement), "Yesterday's action, I mean today, er. uh it seems like yesterday...."
There is much to question about how it would be possible for TV newsmen acting on their own without sattelite-link support, could remain at the site of a two and a half hour "gun battle" that began at approximately 10 AM for the duration,  slowly walk out (nearly 2 miles), and have an edited tape of the raid ready to show on Dallas TV at 11:30 AM.  Several things about the big lie don't add up!

Subj:  rubin's secret testimony
 THE AMIR-RUBIN DEBATE:              YORAM RUBIN'S SECRET TESTIMONY by Barry Chamish
The author is privy to an important document withheld from the media and
public. It is the testimony of Yitzhak Rabin's personal bodyguard Yoram
Rubin taken from the protocols of the trial of Yigal Amir, the alleged
assassin of Rabin. As we recall, Rubin was the bodyguard who jumped on Rabin
after Amir's alleged first shot and took his second shot in the arm.
What is surprising about the secret testimony is how mundane it is compared
to what Rubin testified to in open court. That testimony is far more damning
to his credibility.
The secret testimony begins with the court asking Rubin why the session
should be closed. Rubin replied, "I don't mind being photographed but within
my story I could touch on matters that I wouldn't want made public."
A representative of the intelligence services then explained that operating
procedures and details of secret servicemen should not be publicized. The
defence argued that the court could decide whether to procede after hearing
its questions. The argument did not sway the judges and they decided to hold
the session in camera and afterwards sign a declaration that they heard
testimony denied the public.
The final declaration of the three judges Levy, Rothlevy and Mordick read
that, "To prevent speculation, we must relate that the previous testimony
was held behind closed doors, is not for public attention and will not be
included in the trial protocols."
In the most bizarre episodes of the trial, Amir acted as his own attorney
and personally questioned Rubin, one of the two men he allegedly shot.
Rubin first testified that seven bodyguards in two groups covered Rabin. He
was then asked by Amir why Rabin didn't wear a bulletproof vest. He
answered, "We judge the situation and decide if a bulletproof vest is called
for. Vests are worn only in exceptional cases. The bodyguards never wear
them." At this point Rubin makes a rather remarkable statement. "There were
previous warnings that an incident could happen."
Needless to say, if there were prior warnings, then it was up to Rubin to
make certain Rabin was wearing a bulletproof vest. Amir did not jump on this
point, rather he returned to the question of the makeup of Rabin's bodyguard
Amir- You pointed out that seven bodyguards surrounded Rabin.
Rubin- Thre were seven attached to him and twenty in all. I was the
commander of one group, I walked beside him, another preceded him, another
man walked behind him and he was joined by someone to the left, they formed
the pair guarding the rear. One other proceeded forward and another right to
cover the fence on Ibn Gvirol Street.
Amir- You were with Rabin on the left side.
Rubin- No. I didn't walk on his left.
Amir now questioned the security arrangements but did not make his point.
Instead, he digressed, asking questions about whether bulletproof vests can
be discerned under clothing. His attorney, Jonathan Goldberg addressed Rubin
to help get Amir back on the right track.
Defence- Was the protective ring around Rabin different at this rally than
at other events because according to the defendant, he circled the prime
minister and saw that his protective guard was different?
Rubin- It was different.
Defence- The defendant says that at prior events the formation was two
bodyguards on the side, one in front and another in back but this time the
formation was different.
Amir- At the rally when I got into Rabin's range, a hole opened up for me, I
walked around someone and came in from the side. I always wanted to kill
Rabin but I didn't believe that I'd ever have room to push my hand right to
him. But that's what happened in this case. When I walked towards him I saw
a gap open and I shot him in the back.
In round one, Amir admits to murdering Rabin but has planted deep suspicions
that he had help from Rubin and other Shabak agents. He stops just short of
saying he couldn't have done it without their help. Of course, the judges
didn't see it that way. But any other objective observor would ask why Rabin
wasn't wearing a bulletproof vest if warnings against his life were
received, why the bodyguards changed their regular formation that night and
how did they allow the gap to open which permitted Amir an unhampered shot
at the prime minister?
