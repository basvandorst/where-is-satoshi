Richard and others,
Please stop.  This thread does not belong on the coderpunks mailing list.  If you want to argue
about BXA vs GPL please take it elsewhere.

This is yet another a good example of why one should never confuse using PK certificates with security.  An email PGP signature looks impressive but in
practice it is useless.

PK Unfortunately the "if" is false.  I have no idea if your fancy PK signature really represents you.  Just look at the recent trouble Black Unicorn has had with someone else using the same name affiliated with a key stored on the Network Associates PGP key server. Dave could not verify a PK signature for the PGP software distribution itself.  PKI, or a web of trust, looks good on paper but in practice it does not work when scaled up to large numbers of networked users.
