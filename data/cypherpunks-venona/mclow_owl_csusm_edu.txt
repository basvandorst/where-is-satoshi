     EMERGING JAPANESE ENCRYPTION POLICY
     by
     Stewart A. Baker
Acouple of choice paragraphs:
Japan's encryption policymaking is in its early stages, but there are
strong signs that encryption is increasingly seen as a key technology for
improving Japan's penetration of the Global Information Infrastructure. A
highly selective (and possibly biased) sampling of informed Japanese
opinion on cryptography suggests a growing determination to treat
cryptography as a national Japanese economic priority.
- and -
For a variety of reasons, commercial interests are predominant in Japanese
government thinking about encryption. Time after time during my interviews,
I was reminded that Japan was an island nation that has not had to defend
itself for fifty years and so has not had to confront the national security
concerns associated with encryption. And Japanese police face severe
political and constitutional constraints on wiretapping, so the prospect of
losing this criminal investigative tool seems not to be as troubling to the
Japanese government as to the United States and many European nations.
There's lots more here, and I haven't read it all.

Some comments (off the top of my head):
* What kind of encryption? [The article says RSA. ] How big is the key?
* Why encrypt before compression? If the encryption is any good, then the
encrypted data won't compress much at all. However, compression before
encryption has its own problems.
* Who does the key management (if any)?
* Does MCI store copies of the keys used?
* How does MCI authenticate users who request copies of files, and do they
then return them encrypted or as plaintext? If encrypted, how does the
recepient decryt the files? (He/she just had a disk crash, and this is
their backup medium, remember?)
I looked on MCI's web site , but couldn't find
anything. Besides, it's slower than sludge. [ 90 secs/page over my 128K

If people wish to safeguard their encryption/signature keys by leaving them with a "trusted third party", then they should be able to do so.
If this is a requirement, then it's hardly a service for which there is a "commercial demand".

Mr Gibson --
I'm afraid that I must disagree with your editorial in the October 14th issue of PC Week titled "Encryption Law Change: Good News" . This is not a good change, but rather another attempt by the government to get it's "key escrow" (now renamed 'key recovery') agenda added to commercial software products.
Let's start with the facts. A) This is not a change in the law. There is no law regarding export of encryption software.
Congress has never passed any such law. These are State Department regulations, and presidential decrees. These regulations, which have the force of law to you and me, were never debated or voted upon by our elected representatives. They can be changed tomorrow the same way. In fact, they can be changed and the public need not even be notified.
B) The Clinton administration agreed to allow the export of unescrowed encryption that used 56 bit keys for six months (with up to three six month renewals) on the following conditions:
Condition  is what the Clinton Administration has been fighting for since 1993 when it first announced the Clipper chip, the ability to recover the plaintext of any encrypted communication.
Condition  puts these companies at the mercy of a government panel which will decide, every six months, whether or not an internal project is proceeding 'satisfactorily'. If not, the company will be unable to sell its' encryption products abroad. This is a _big_ stick that the government can use to influence companies' actions.
Condition  requires the companies to obsolete their products in two years, because they will no longer be able to sell the "unescrowed" software abroad, and because one of the goals of "key recovery" is that it will not interoperate with software that does not support "key recovery".
Your editorial states:
Even if this was, as you wrote, a "complete about face", and there were no other conditions (such as key recovery)  involved, it would still be inadequate. A paper written this year by a group of noted cryptologists titled "Minimal Key Lengths for Symmetric Ciphers to Provide Adequate Commercial Security" recommends that the minimum key length for security today was at least 75 bits, and for data that needs to be secured for the next twenty years, at least 90 bit keys should be used.
The entire paper is availiable at  (ASCII) and  (PostScript). It is fascinating reading.
This is incomplete and misleading. The original Clipper press release, (availiable at  ) states:
Please note the word "normally".
The Clinton Administration, even though repeatedly asked, has never explained what consitutes an abnormal case, and what they would consider authorization in that case.
This was not a typo. This Q&A was part of an official White House press release.
C) What exactly is "key recovery"? How does it work?
No one knows. The White House press release doesn't say. The idea is that the 11 vendor coalition will work out the methodology, and the White House will "approve" it. This is, in my mind, one of the slickest moves in the whole situation. The administration has taken a problem that they have been unable to solve to the satisfaction of the computer industry (access to all encrypted communications), and suddenly, it's not the administration's problem any more! It's the computer industry's problem!
From an article in a recent ComputerWorld: ()
Who are these "observers"? They don't seem very observant to me.
The government has stated that the export of unescrowed 56 bit encryption software is a temporary measure, and will be prohibited again (at the very latest) on Jan 1, 1999. At that time, the only (medium or) strong encryption software that will be allowed to be exported will be that which supports "key recovery".
In conclusion, this is not a "refreshing change of direction" for the Clinton administration.  This was "more of the same", albeit better disguised. The 11 companies who signed up for this coalition are receiving very little (56 bit export for at most two years), in exchange for giving up control of their encryption technologies to the government forever.

I never argued that these regulations did not have the force of law.
In fact, I conceded that they did.
Nevertheless, they are not laws.
They were neither debated nor voted upon by our elected representatives.
They can be changed at a moment's notice by the State Department, which takes its' orders from the President. The announcement that prompted Mr. Gibson's editorial did not come from the State Department, who putatively has authority over the ITAR.  Instead, the announcement was made from the office of the Vice President, and begins "President Clinton and I" and speaks throughout of "The Administration's initiative".
_That_ was the distinction that I was making.
FWIW, I was unable to find the announcement on the White House's web server, but it is availiable at Here is another example (taken from the Clipper debate):
In a paper about privacy and the original Clipper proposal (in 1994) A. Michael Froomkin of the University of Miami School of Law pointed out that since the entire key-escrow infastructure was created by presidential decree, and the proposed key holders were part of the executive branch, the provisions for release of the keys could be changed at a moment's notice by another presidential decree, which need not ever be made public.

Though in many ways it is a restatement of approaches already suggested elsewhere, the document urges a shift towards free market forces on the Net and a rejection of government interference in electronic commerce.

a "policy lunch" in San Francisco. It was in one of the hotels hosting

Mr. Murray gave a long, impassioned speech.
He said that the government is going to crack down on
domestic possession and use of crypto, that they
were looking to increase their wiretapping capabilities
100-fold, and so on.
He was very emphatic about not trusting anything
that the government says, and that once they got
their "foot in the door", that they would seek to
expand their abilities to regulate, etc, etc.
He advocated deployment of strong crypto. He
insisted that there was no way the government

Let's not start this.
Tim wasn't arguing for or against abortion; he made no comments
about abortion. His comment was that the _argument_ used to "legalize"
abortion was unconvincing to him.
If we are going to discuss privacy, that's fine.

I attended this presentation. Basically, what they do is to add
two packets to the "channel setup process", one that depends only
on the coorespondents, the other that contains the information
about this particular session.
A problem with this, as I pointed out to the presenters, is
that the first packet can be trivially used for traffic analysis.
The eavesdropper may not be able to determine who is
cooresponding, but they can tell if it is the same people
as in a previous conversation.
As you can see, IBM suggests cacheing the contents of the
first packet, so that you don't have to recalculate it each
time. Imagine how easy traffic analysis would be if the
identification packets were identical instead of just related.

I like this idea.
However, I would suggest an additional refinement:
is all the 'approved' messages. This way, people who wish
to have the benefits of a filtered list are happy, people who
wish to have posts rated for them (but be able to check on
the "rater") are happy, and people who wish to see every
message are happy.

from Deloitte-Touche Internet Privacy Coalition luncheon
last week? I mean, he all but advocated violent overthrow of
the government. D-T is the most "establishment" of the big-6
accounting firms, last time that I looked.
It's a weird world when we have a representative of a
company that makes a living advising people on how to
obey government regulations advocating civil disobedience.

After a while, I stopped taking notes, because I was so astounded at
what he was saying.
(Maybe someone with more complete notes could post a better summary)
But, here a brief overview of the luncheon:
Last Wednesday, January 29th, the Internet Privacy Coalition had
a "policy lunch" in San Francisco. It was in one of the hotels hosting
the RSA conference, and at the same time that the conference was
breaking for lunch, so it was easy for attendees to "switch lunches".
The speakers (as I remember, apologies to any I miss) were:
Mr. Murray gave a long, impassioned speech.
He said that the government is going to crack down on
domestic possession and use of crypto, that they
were looking to increase their wiretapping capabilities
100-fold, and so on.
He was very emphatic about not trusting anything
that the government says, and that once they got
their "foot in the door", that they would seek to
expand their abilities to regulate, etc, etc.
He advocated deployment of strong crypto. He
insisted that there was no way the government
could stop the export of strong crypto. He exhorted
people to refuse to obey the ITAR/EAR regulations,
and to lobby their congresscritters to get the
PRO-CODE bill passed.
It wasn't really what he said that amazed me, because
I had heard most of it (in bits and pieces) before. It

I wonder how many of these companies signed up
"just to appear on the list".
Apple, as far as I know, has no GAK project in place.
In fact, as far as I know, the last GAK-related action
that anyone at Apple has participated, was to participate in
the original press release.
This is not meant as a defense of Apple. I have discussed
their support of this organization with senior management there,
and tried to convince them of the errors of their ways. Rather,
it is a comment on their current activities regarding GAK.
Apple also happens to be the one company on that list that
I have non-public knowledge of.

No, I did not.
I feel that Apple's "lack of participation" is much more a preoccupation
with other matters (like losing $700M) rather than a stand on principle.
However, I suspect that if Apple management actually started work on
such a project (or were ready to begin seeding), there would be a lot of
opposition, both inside and outside Apple.
Martin, do you have any comment on this?

Why do people do what things?
Do you mean:
Why does the state of Texas collect this information and sell it
to anyone who is willing to write a check?
Why would anyone take this publically availiable information
and make it available to the public?
When my libertairan streak is in full flood, I think that since
this information was collected by government employees and
paid for by tax dollars, that it should be availiable to anyone
who wants it, for (minimal or) no cost.
Of course, the better solution is to not collect the information
at all. (Not selling it just means that people can buy it on the
black market, or in the case of TRW, etc; buy legislatures)

That was my take, too.
IANAL, but I don't see how this "agreement" can possibly work.
Especially since it's not an agreement at all.
Congress will pass a law, and if the tobacco companies don't like
it, (a foregone conclusion, given the posturing going on) they will
sue to overturn it. (And again IMHO, they'll win.)
Then congress will pass another law more to the
tobacco companies liking.
I predict this will not be settled until after Clinton leaves office.
