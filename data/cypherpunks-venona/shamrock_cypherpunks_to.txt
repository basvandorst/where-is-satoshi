There are a number of technical reasons why you really don't want to call
the standard commandline Ecash client from a script to add/retrieve Ecash
from Mixmaster remailer packets. The biggest problem being that you can
fit only a few coins into the packet header as specified. There is
no feature in the standard Ecash client that allows coin level
control. DigiCash firmly resited and continues to resist adding it. A
$0.25 payment could be paid as three coins or as 25 coins. The user has no
control over this. For this and a number of other reasons, DigiCash's
software is unsuitable for the task.
You certainly could use DigiCash's software with Type 1 remailers. Though
why anybody would want to pay for a service as insecure as Type 1
remailers is beyond me. Type 1 remailers should be removed from service.
Furthermore, the barrier to entry is too high for the consumer. All these
problems are about to be solved by third party software. Perhaps then we
will see for-pay remailers.

Correct. The adversary watches messages move in and out of the mix. [This
is quite easy to acomplish, given the security or lack thereof, of much
network infrastructure]. I really don't have the time to write an intro on
this topic. Subscribe to
the Bugtraq mailing list for a year and you'll understand what I mean.
Once you have all the mail going in and out, you make use of the simple
fact that Type 1 messages must shrink with each hop. See the classic
essay "Mixmaster & Remailer Attacks" at
IMHO, operating Type 1 remailers is doing the world a disfavor. It
provides a compromised technology  to a large number of people unaware of
the fact while, if anything, slowing down development and deployment of
better technology. Do you think it would have taken two (or more) years to
port Mixmaster to DOS had there been no Type 1 remailers? Of course not.
If you run a Type 1 remailer, do your users a favor: shut it down and
replace it with a Type 2.

 because the iris pattern is on the eye's surface. In fact, the video

 - Chipknip (IEP) specific commands added
 - new internal commands
 - infrastructure for implementing card specific commands has been added
   (which the chipknip commands are built on top of)

additional cards. If you have an ISO7816 compatible smartcard with
programmer reference manual and minimal C knowledge, you can contribute to
the project. Full source is at

of you with commmercial readers we don't already support; how about
writing a table for our reader abstraction layer]?
We currently support the home-built Dumb Mouse, Schlumberger, Gemplus, and
Phillips readers. Either one of these outfits will sell you one of their
readers for ~$100. They are all equally capable. It doesn't matter
which one you get. The Gemplus reader looks the coolest. Email me if you
need a contact address.
o ISO7816-[3,4] -3 is online, -4 isn't yet, pending a good copy that can
be scanned. But you can get by with just 7816-3.  I am.
o A smartcard, ideally with programmer reference manual. Gemplus will send
you their reference in PDF and a sample GPK4000 (sig only) for free. Schlumberger will sell you 4 CryptoFlex cards for $80, but requires an NDA
for the manual. Bull is between card revisions and doesn't really have any
intresting crypto cards at the moment. Same with Siemens. If your interst
is more towards cash cards, we already have  support for Chipknip
(Proton). Beyond that, you are on your own. But if it speaks ISO7816, you
can write an STEST table for it. In fact, you can write the table from the
manual without ever touching a card. But this  is less gratifying. Still,
we would be thankful for any and all tables  added to STEST.

What you really want is the ability to slow down the mobility of the raid
force while making your exit. In a prolonged siege, the attacker will
always win.  A good way of slowing down the attacker after an initial
armed response is to deploy chemicals. A combination of Tabun and Mustard
Gas works best, but don't deploy them at the same time. Use the Tabun
first for maximium impact. Follow up with the Mustard Gas a few minutes
later. The underground irrigation systems common on California properties
are ideal means of gas deployment. You should be able to retrofit the
system for under $500. Assuming you already have the gas. Of course you
need to make sure to keep a chem suit at home. After you make your exit, you can clean out the next with a previously
installed fuel/air explosive.

Schlumberger, and Philips. Therefore, there is no need to for another
production run of our own reader. If you wonder which reader to buy, I

I asked the exhibitor if the scanner would grant access to a hand not
attached to the body. At first, the exhibitor paled and replied that if a
severed hand was part of my thread model (not using these terms), then my
"facility had larger problems than could be solved by access control". The

following me with their eyes as I walked away from the exhibit.
Seems these amateurs hadn't considered that somebody getting ready to blow

company that understands security.

Making the mag stripe on a driver license unreadable by a POS terminal is

chances are you then won't be sold any alcohol.
See, major chains, such as the Southland corporation [7/11], recently
installed POS terminals that are linked to the cash register. [This may
not have reached a particular reader's area yet, please don't reply with
"but my 7/11 down the corner does not do this"].
Unless a driver license has been swiped, the cash register will not permit
the clerk to ring up the sale. It doesn't matter how old you are, you can
be 80 years old and in a wheelchair, no government issued ID with working
mag stripe, no alcohol or tobacco products for you.
The clerk at my local 7/11 assured me the information captured would not
be forwarded to a central site. Yet. It appears the stores are installing
these systems to protect themselves against police sting "test buys", in
which the authorities take persons just days shy of their 21st birthday,
put theater makeup and/or a gray beard and wig on them and thus entrap
store clerks into selling controlled substances to minors.
As any fool can predict, the information captured will not remain local
for long. After all, the system is ideal for monitoring gun^H^H^H alcohol
purchases of parolees, tracking down deadbeat dads, etc.

At HIP'97, I watched a van Eck demonstration given by a German professor.
Using cheap analog equipment and one of the better HP frequency

the monitoring equipment to a specific PC. Even if there are numerous PC

The boundaries between NRA and HCI are blurry. I am thinking about leaving
the NRA, but since I am a Life Member, I can at least vote for the NRA
--Lucky, JPFO member and proud of it.

Well, at least this makes it clear where EPIC stands on civil liberties.

NFW that Matt would get arrested. He is too high profile. They haven't
become that blatant just yet. Arresting Matt would trigger more pro-bono
work than the DOJ has staff. :-) Besides, Matt would not engage in illegal

14.4 modem, awsome sound quality, 2048 bit DH, 3DES. Have one, love it.

Ultimately, It won't make a difference, but sure, why not. Crypto regs can
go one way, and one way only: more restrictive. See some 5 years of my
postings on this topic. Lobbying and litigation can only delay the arrival
of a total ban on general purpose strong crypto, not prevent it. Note that
I am not at all claiming that either lobbying or litigation is useless. By
all means, keep it up. It just won't change the fact that the ratchet
turns only into one direction. Until the ratchet breaks, but that is
another matter entirely and tends to be acompanied by lots of dead bodies.
I doubt we will find out anytime soon. Favors? Blackmail? Most likely
all of the above. But it doesn't matter why the representative of
country A or B voted for export controls. We already know that most, if
not all, governments would fall all over themselves banning crypto
outright were they exposed to some of the traffic this list has seen over
the years.
What does surpise me, however, is why some people (not John) tend act
surprised when the ratchet tightens yet another notch. I can't help but
wonder if they are equally surprised when the sun goes up in the morning
or tide moves in. Weird.

The company used to be called Comsec.  They've
expanded and are working on the next revision of the product. The old
version was $750 each. The new version will be a lot less expensive. When
you call, ask for Eric Blossom. (831) 333-9393  x12
Starium's current generation phone encryption device, the GSP8191,
performs a 2048 bit DH key exchange to establish a 3DES session key. Each
party then reads out half of the hash. If the hashes match, you know that
you are not subject to an MIM attack. The system has perfect forward
secrecy. Thumb screws will have no effect. :-)

I believe that there will be free havens for crypto for some time to come.
Crypto is too obscure a topic to be outlawed worldwide anytime soon. So
the Canadian entrepreneurs Tim is referring to and others determined to
ship crypto will be able to do so for many, many years by simply
relocating development to other countries.
Just as there are small countries that don't play ball with FINCEN, there
will be small countries that don't play ball with crypto regs and be that
because that's the countries only significant source of hard cash.

Traffic analysis is performed using wire loops in the the road. The
sensors mountend on overpasses near truck scales fulfill a different (so
far unknown) purpose.

The wire loops (in sets of two a few meters apart) are in every stretch of
freeway in California. They report the numbers and speed of all
vehicles. Have so for decades. This allows the Caltrans operation centers
to instantly identify backups due to accidents, etc. Once in a while, the
evening news do a story on these operation centers.
So we still don't know what the grey sensors do. Note that these sensors
are typically mounted only above the two right lanes.
