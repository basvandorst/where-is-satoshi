I walked straight through British, Dutch and Maltese Customs at the respective airports and they didn't even ask what was in the bag, let alone what software. I had PGP and a huge keyring stored on my hard drive and they were known the wiser.
I'd suggest to lugging them through as hand luggage. If you are worred, zip up pgp and so on with a password - if customs do check, they aren't gonna waste breaking the zip password (even though it can be done quickly)
Also, I think the law may different, as you are an American Citizen using your own equipment...
