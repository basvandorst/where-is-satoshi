@_subject: Re: Review of the EPP plug-in 0.2 for Eudora 
Hi...I'm the developer. I'd like to respond to these items that Alan Olsen
listed so that everyone knows what the heck I'm doing with the Eudora/PGP
Plug-In, a.k.a EPPI.
[snippet about what EPPI is deleted]
Unfortunately, the plug-in developers kit, called the Eudora Messaging
System API (EMS API), is very limited, and only provides the functions
necessary to get the incoming or currently-displayed mail message, and to
paste the results of the plug-in into said message. It gives _no_ control
over the Eudora menus. In fact, you can't even activate any arbitrary menu
or function of Eudora, nor can you read any information besides what is
passed to you by the various functions which call your plug-in.
Many of the problems below have been called to my attention. I'll note those
that have, and add to my list those that haven't. I'll also explain what I'm
doing to correct the problems. If anyone has a better suggestion of fixing a
specific problem, please let me know.
Already known. I'll have a field to specify default ID, with an entry for
the hex key ID in case there are more than one of the same user ID.
Already known. I'll perform the word-wrap in the plug-in.
Already known. I'll change the way the plug-in replaces text by only
replacing the text between the PGP BEGIN and END headers.
There's not much I can do about this. I have no way of knowing in the
plug-in that a user has switched personalities, so there is no way to notify
the plug-in to use a different configuration. I could, however, add
personalities to the plug-in, which would at least let the user select
different configurations in it to match the current personality being used.
Thank you. Yes, I knew it was going to be rough at first, hence the version
numbering of 0.x. I'll get to 1.0 when I feel it's truly a polished Eudora
plug-in worthy of paying for (though I plan to keep it freeware).
Sadly, my account was unexpectedly yanked out from under me, so that
information is wrong. However, thanks to some generous folks who responded
to my plight, I have some temporary locations set up, until I can find a
permanent home. Here is the updated information:
Download version 0.20 from the Web:
   *      (for 16-bit version of Eudora 3.0 for Windows 3.1)
   *      (for 32-bit version of Eudora 3.0 for Windows NT/95)
If you don't have Web access, but have FTP access, try the following sites.
Note that if the version you are trying to get was released today or just a
few days ago, it may not have shown up at the sites below yet, so give it a
few days:
papa.indstate.edu: /pub/winsock-l/mail/epp16v02.zip
                   /pub/winsock-l/Windows95/mail/epp32v02.zip
                   /pub/winsock-l/WindowsNT/mail/epp32v02.zip
ftp.winsite.com:   /pub/pc/win3/winsock/epp16v02.zip
                   /pub/pc/win95/winsock/epp32v02.zip
If you want to be automatically notified of new versions, send e-mail to
EPPINEWS with the following message body:
You will not be able to post to this list. It is merely a convenient way to
receive notification of new updates to EPPI.

I have noticed that GeoCities has had some problems last week. Hopefully,
these are corrected by now. If not, try the FTP sites.
