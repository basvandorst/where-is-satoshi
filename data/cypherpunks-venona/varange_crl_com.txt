Burning the floppy would seem to solve the problem.  Lock sensitive
data in RAM away from disks except for burnable floppies.  I guess
linux can be configured to keep sensitive data in a RAM filesystem,
keeping it from being synced or flushed.

Consdering how none of the above incidents are connected in any way to the internet, what do you mean?  And what if there were bomb making instructions on the internet and people are killed on account of it,
so what?
Mix roughly equal amounts of potassiam chlorate and red phosphorous together while thoroughly wet.  When the mixture dries it becomes a fulminating highly explosive mixture that doesn't even contain a nitrogen molecule, so seventy pounds of the explosive can be brought onto an airplane by passing through the nitrogen bomb sniffers in luggage.
You are now a potential terrorist Stephan Schmidt.  If the anti-extremists had their way, you will be a top candidate for arrest for being a dangerous German, we all know that now, we can honestly testify in German court you openly subscribed to an internet high tech e-mailing list where terrorist secrets were being traded.
How do you feel about being a terrorist, Mr. Schmidt?

Are you familiar with the Jefferson Bible?  It's an excerpt and
rearrangement of the gospels to produce a more liberal effect.
It shows that Thomas Jefferson was into interpretation rather
than doctrinaire discipline.
And rather than "dispensing drugs in clinics," why not simply
scrap the drug laws entirely?  People have a *right* to do as
they please with their bodies.

You media monopoly asswipes love corporate press releases because
your too cheap to hire real journalists.
Yes, there's a problem with publishing ADS as news.  Look at the magazine shelfs and the newspapers for proof.

@_subject: wealth and property rights 
If the free market is a good thing, that it's a democratic way of
getting the best to the top of the economic ladder, then I see no
reason why this should not also apply to politics.
The people have every right to use democracy to establish a
non-democratic system re: abolishment of the wealthy as a class
and sentencing the entire Forbes 400 and their underlings to 25
years at forced labor, say 16 hour days at picking vegetables
under the pain of the knouted whip.
No Libertarian could oppose the use of the political free market
of democracy for undemocratic ends; that would violate the spirit
of liberty!

@_subject: Cash - Covenience and privacy over the threat of being mugged 
Why not just carry sufficient cash for your purchasing needs?
Irrational fear of muggers I guess is the primary reason not
to carry around, say, $500.00 cash.  But if you were mugged
for that much, wouldn't you feel worse about the mugging
itself than the actual loss of the money?  I doubt the mere
carrying of greater amounts of cash makes someone more likely
to be mugged than someone carrying nothing.  So it boils down
to whether you think it's better to use the inconvenience and
invasion of privacy of credit cards and/or checks and getting
them stolen over convenience and privacy of cash and getting
an anonymous $500.00 cash stolen.
(You also can *sign* your cash to help trace thefts.  I used to
do this when hanging around disreputable charactors.  Hell,
drug dealers will accept your money if you wrote down his
identification and "Crack Bill of Sale" in magic marker on
every bill.)
BTW, my uncle was mugged at Provo Park for thirty five
cents and my front windshield of my car was smashed in for
the fifty cents in open view between the passenger seats.
You know those ancient mono AM only radios that are almost
always broken down in old cars?  Yep, had a window smashed and
the worthless radio stolen.  In another vehicle that was even
shittier looking I never locked the doors and nothing was ever
stolen; the radio and cassette player actually worked!
Merry bloody crassmus.

This article will be saved to

FALSE COMPLAINTS category of my index.html.
Six weeks or so is all the public access there is to the wtmp
file; ask Sandy or Stan if you don't know how to read it from
your own CRL account.  (How conveniant of you to accuse me of
the repulsive "Mark Wehal(sp?)" forgery past the date it can be
easily verified; why should the CRL admins drag out their backup
tapes on the account of your spurious allegations?  Anyone who
checked up Dejanews on "Mark Wehal" could have seen that some
user had forged his name as revenge spam against "Mark Wehal's"
offensive under 18 style sex spam in a few exceedingly odd
choice of newgroups, alas, "Mark Wehal" never complained about
the forgery and an unknown user may have been the instigator
of a business prank against a ligitimate electronics firm
whose street address was listed in the original sex spam.)
Or check the Here: line of my posts for better readability
than the additional standard Date: line.
"Our?"  Are you allowed to abuse the Stanford network because
you are a user, employee, or the actual admin?
If Graves is the actual admin, or is allowed to act like one,
then bona fide complaints about users conduct on the Stanford
network can't be sent directly via e-mail; send a registered
letter/return receipt to whomever is responsible (who?)
I read his post as a threat to the Stanford network.
