There are some other problems too I believe.  I have worked for a decent sized network who did all user authentication at the terminal servers for dial-in accounts thru DNS.  This wasn't too bad for just passws and stuff, but wouldn't this cause some bloat in the nameservers database?  As well as cause problems security wise when it comes to updates.  Would these automatically not be cached in any form by the site making the request?  This also causes a problem for smaller time people who perhaps have a PPP/SLIP connection 24/7 but have nameserve done by their prvider, and I for sure don't want my provider to be in control of those keys.

This can be done with hacked telephones probably.  A switch in the telphones that then takes the line over turning it into a data connection and negotiating keys etc.. with the remote side which would have a similiarly equipped telephone.  It may already be done, but rather prohibitevly expensive for common use.
not true really, most providers shut off accounts that run SLIRP if they also offer SLip/PPP service to customers. I know MCSnet did.  but SLIP/PPP was only five dollars more a month and offered much better "I regret that I have but six orifices to give you" -Nesta Stubbs
