While some of the "information" cited in this post is technically possible, as a
sys admin at a small start-up ISP, I can guarantee you that at least one ISP in the US is not kissing MS's ass in such a fashion.
One would need to present a warrant in order to obtain our customer information.
I sure as hell don't have the time or desire to help Gates track down people whohave managed to find their way around paying for his bloated OS.
It seems to me that the ISP would have to be in cahoots with Gates in order to make piracy charges stick.  Hence, one more arguement for using small, privacy oriented ISPs.  The lesson here is, never trust the telco ;)
