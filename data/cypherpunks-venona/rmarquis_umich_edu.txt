@_subject: Illustrations 
I was wondering if anyone had any .gifs or .jpgs (on the web I suppose)
which illustrate how encryption works.  Just simple pictures and
illustrations are fine.  Thanks.

@_subject: Questions 
I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me out.  I am writing a
research paper and I need some interviews for it.  If you could answer any
of these questions about security, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thanks
for your time.

Please send responses to rmarquis
- How can PGP help secure something like e-mail?
- Are there any encryption schemes which are "unbreakable"?
- What would someone need to do to send an e-mail message which cannot be
read or altered by anyone else, or is it not possible?
