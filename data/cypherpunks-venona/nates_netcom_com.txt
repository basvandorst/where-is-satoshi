Since I moved all my personal mail to netcom, I was wondering
how I could change my info in my key to reflect my
new identity?

  If passwords should traverse the Internet only in encrypted form, what about other sensitive information?  Standardization efforts for "privacy-enhanced" e-mail have been under way for more than five years, but widespread adoption lies well in the future.  "The interoperability problem is nasty," Ware says, unless everyone has software that can handle encrypted messages, it is of little use to anyone.
  Encryption could provide not only privacy but authentication as well: messages encoded using so-called public-key ciphers can uniquely identify both recipient and sender.  But encryption software in general remains at the center of a storm of political and legal controversy.  THe U.S. government bars easy export of powerful encoding software even though the same codes are freely available overseas.
  Within the U.S., patent rights to public-key encryption are jealously guarded by RSA Data Security, a private firm that licensed the patents from their inventors.  Although software enploying public-key algorithms has been widely published, most people outside the U.S. government cannot osse it without risking an infringement suit.
  To complicate matters even further, the government has proposed a different encryption standard, one whose algorithm is secret and whose keys would be held in encrow by law-enforcement agencies.  Although many civil libertarians and computer scientists oppose the measure, some industry figures have come out in favor of it.  "You can't have absolute privacy," Parker says.  "A democracy just can't operate that way."
  The question is not whether cyberspace will be subjected to legislation but rather "how and when law and order will be imposed," Parker says.  He predicts that the current state of affairs will get much worse before the government steps in "to assure privacy and to protect the rights people do have."
  Others do not have Parker's confidence in government intervention.  Ranum forsees an internet made up mostly of private enclaves behind firewalls that he and his colleagues have built.  "There are those who say that fire walls are evil, that they're balkanizing the Internet," he notes, "but brotherly love fall on it's face when millions of dollars are   Denning counts herself among the optimists.  She lends her support to local security measures, but "I don't lose any sleep over security," she says.  Farber, also cautiously optimistic, sees two possible directions for the Internet in the next few years:  rapid expansion of existing services, or fundamental reengineering to provide a secure base for the future.  He leaves no doubt as to which course he favors.  Spafford is likeminded but gloomier.  "It's a catch 22," he remarks.  "Everyone wants to operate with what exists, but the existing standards are rotten.  They're not what want to build on."
  Even if computer scientists do redesign the Internet, he points out, putting new standards in place may be impossible because of the enormous investment in old hardware and software.  So much of the Internet rests on voluntary cooperation, he observes, that making sweeping changes is almost impossible.
  Then again, Ware counters, perhaps piecemeal evolution may be the only possibility.  No single organization understands the idea of a national information infrastructure well enough to be put in charge, he contends: "There's no place to go and say `Here's the money, work out all the problems.'  There aren't even three places, and I'm not sure there should   In the meantime, the network grows, and people and businesses entrust to -------- cut here --------

@_subject: Re: clipper==bad, but how do you explain this to average joe 6-pack? 
I have to agree with Time, etc that many of my friends say the equivilant
of "what a stupid idea... it'll never pass" when I explain what the gov
is trying to do to us.  Some of my friends, however, think I am
totally paranoid (not completely false) and that I should just
chill out a bit.
The problem is that many people say that clipper is so stupid it'll
never pass, so they assume that their congress-critter will do the
"right" thing and dump clipper.  This is where most people fail.
Our congress-critters are most likely *not* going to do the right thing, since their ears are being pulled by the NSA and the FBI,
etc... who think that unless all of us are watched, we'll hurt ourselves
or hurt eachother like a bunch of infants.

I cannot help but think that having the gov looking in on us will
be good.  I know, get my head shrunk, but look:  It gives us something
to fight for.  Look at me:  Somewhat of a slacker who for a long while
thought there was nothing worth fighting for... now there's the government to fight!  What better entity to wage war against?  It's the
classic "valiant fight" the "good guys against the bad guys" fight.
It's the kind of fight you may even feel yourself _wanting_ to fight.
I can't help thinking what a kick I'll get out of seeing my kids in
the future saying, upon them finding my "Cypherpunk Criminal" T-Shirt
in the attic, "Gosh!  Dad was a Cypherpunk!  Wow!"
I'm not (obviously, look at my track record) advocating the Clipper/Capstone/
blah/blah/blah standards or the new draconian legislation proposals...
I'm just saying that it's easier to fight when there's something tangible to fight... it's hard now, since there are no laws keeping me
from having a copy of PGP on my Mac (yet), to see what we're fighting.  Maybe
in a year or two there will be.  Who knows.
This National ID Card *really* scares me.  It floods my mind with images
of me standing in line to buy a CD (or whatever) and getting to the front
of the line, being asked for my National ID card (So the proper taxes can
be assesed, and since they cannot sell to non-citizens... blah blah blah)
and me saying "Gosh... I must have left it in my other pants" or me pulling out a card with a very obvious blowtorch hole in the center (imagine little semi-toasted copper wires hangin out from behind the melted
plastic case) and saying "I had a little accident"
To be honest, if given the chance to get a job after I graduate (blessed
be that day) that involves me moving to some non-USA (or non-Police State)
location, I would be inclined to take it... fast.  I have been leaning towards
the "Let's overthrow the government!" crowd lately, what with reading
all this shit from the FBI, etc... but it's rather pointless to want
to overthrow a government as vast and powerful as our own, so I think it's
best to just plot a guerilla underground haven for myself.
Sorry to waste the bandwidth, but I had to get this off my chest...
(Oh, and sorry for not making it to the last Colorado CPs meeting,
all hell broke loose at work and I had to fix just about everything...)

@_subject: pgptools app wanted 
Hello punksters...
I am almost done with some remailer software and I need something:
an app that takes input from a specified file and sends output
to anothe specified file (all on command line) and asks for the
key from stdin or from an environment variable.  This I need since PGP will not take environment vars or stdin for getting the key for
a conventionally encrypted file.
I would also like a program that will do nothing but encrypt
a file specified on the command line and dump ascii-armoured
output to another file, and ask for the password from an
environment variable or from stdin.
I am asking this since I hope someone else will have already done this or learned pgptools well enough to do it quickly.
I thought about modifying PGP, but I also thought that many people
would not want to use my remailer if I had to hack PGP to make
it work ;-)
My remailer implements the following features:
Latency:  MINUTES  (where  is an integer or the word "RANDOM")
Request-Remailing-To: username (of course)
PleaseDontPad  (keeps the mailer from padding the message)
Encrypted: PGP  (message is encrypted with the remailer's pubkey)
SubjectEnclosed  (if message is encrypted, the subject can be hidden
                  inside the encryption envelope, on lines 1-5)
SuperEncrypted  (if the messge is encrypted, it looks for a line in the
                 decrypted message that looks like: (on lines 1-5)
                 SuperEncryptionKey: cjkdsancuiabcdsbakjcdsabkjcdsa
                 and uses that key to decrypt the message again. )
In a configuration file, the owner can specify a few options, also:
here's an example:
# debuglevel sets the degugging level, 0 = off, 1 = on and 2 = picky.
debuglevel                2
# loglevel sets the resolution of logs:
# 0 = off.  No logs at all.
# 1 = Log Synopsis of message (from, to, subject, size, etc... not content)
# 2 = Log Full message to the mailbox specified in logmbox
# 3 = Log Full text and synopsis
loglevel                  3
logmbox                   ./log/mbox
logsynopsis               ./log/synopsis
# This is the directory that all tempfiles, etc are set relative to
homedir                   /staff/nate/dev/perl/remail
# set the maximum number of latency minutes for random latency requests
maxlatmin                 20
# the process number will be appended to this name
tempfile                  ./remailer-temp
# defaultsubject specifies the subject to use if none is given, omit to
# forward no subject at all.
defaultsubject            There is no subject.
# The mailbox that diagnostic mail and non-remialer mail is sent to.
mbox                      ./mbox
# Passphrase for PGP decryption.
passphrase                nckldanjcsancjkndsakjcdsajk
# sourceblock blocks mail coming FROM this address
sourceblock               detweiler
# destblock blocks mail addressed TO the address.
destblock                 nate
# netblock will block all mail going to that subnet.
netblock                  whitehouse.gov
In addition to this, the owner can change the number of padding
sizes and their individual sizes... the remailer strips out the padding
when it gets a message and adds it to the end when it's about
to leave.

@_subject: Nate's Remailer... slight problem 
It appears that Netcom does not have the latest version of perl
(4.0 rev 36), so some of the pattern patching code does not
return theproper value... for instance, if I can find a string like
"hello there" with 4.0r36, in the version that netcom has, I only
get "hello"
So, basically, the name displayed for my remailer is "Jed's" and it should actually be "Jed's Anonymous Remailer Emporium and Tanning Salon"
This should not affect any of the functioning of the remailer, but it
does affect the cosmetics.  I am talking with netcom to see when they are
going to upgrade...

@_subject: bumperstickers 
I have found a source for paper to print bumper stickers on.  It's a
thin plastic that is *very* sticky on one side, and made to go through
laser printers.
I have been tossing around some ideas for stickers to make, and I have come
up with a few... what so you think?
The WIRED ist icon, with and without text
"CYPHERPUNK CRIMINAL"
the "Warning: Strong Crypto" logo from the Tshirts
"1984: We're behind schedule, NSA"
and others.
Who would be interested, and does anyone have more ideas.
I would be selling individual stikers for between $0.50 and $1.00 each,
depending on their size (some may be 3" square, some may be "8x3", etc...)
