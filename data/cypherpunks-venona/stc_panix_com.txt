 SAMPLE LETTER OR PHONE CALL
 The Honorable Senator ____________
 I understand you will be attending the hearings on the Clipper chip.
 I wanted to express my concern about the use of the Clipper chip
 in personal communications.  The Clipper chip would mandate a  privacy standard that is prone to significant abuse.   Unlike most recent work in cryptography, the academic work surrounding  the chip has been kept from the public, developed in secret.
 Decent cryptography exists today to protect my communications.
 The Clipper chip threatens my ability to use that technology.
 Please oppose the Clipper chip.
 Sincerely,
