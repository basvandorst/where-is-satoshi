SPEAKER:	Benny Chor, TITLE:		Private Information Retrieval
DATE:		Wednesday, September 25, 1996
TIME:		3:30 pm

Publicly accessible databases are an indispensable resource for retrieving  up to date information. But they also pose a significant risk to the privacy of the user, since a curious database operator can follow the user's queries and infer what the user  is after. Indeed, in cases where the users' intentions are to be kept secret, users are often cautious about accessing the database. It can be shown that when accessing a single database, to completely guarantee the privacy of the user, the whole database
should be downloaded , namely $n$ bits should be communicated (where $n$ is the number of bits in the database).
In this work, we investigate whether by replicating the database, more
efficient solutions to the private retrieval problem can be obtained. We describe schemes that enable a user to access $k$ replicated copies of
a database ($k\geq 2$) and privately retrieve information stored in the
database. This means that each individual database gets no information on
the identity of the item retrieved by the user. These schemes use the
replication to gain substantial saving.
In the talk, I will describe the original work on this topic (joint work
with Oded Goldreich, Eyal Kushilevitz, and Madhu Sudan), as well as recent
developments in this area. Refreshments to follow.

@_subject: Microsoft CAPI 
"Today Microsoft is using similar technology as part of its Cryptography
API: You can't load an encryption engine into Windows 95 or Windows NT
unless that engine has been specially signed by Microsoft's corporate key.
The reason for this restriction, says the company, is the Clinton
administration: Microsoft couldn't have gotten export permission for its
operating systems if users could easily plug in crypto engines that hadn't
been approved. "
This is disturbing, if true, though I suspect there is also a less ominous
reason: you certainly want your cryptography provider to be trusted, and you
want to be sure the code has not been altered. The implications really
depend on Microsoft's policy on signing cryptography engines, and whether
they allow a way to delegate signature authority.
