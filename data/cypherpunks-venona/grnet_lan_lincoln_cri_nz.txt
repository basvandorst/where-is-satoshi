@_subject: PGP to SMTP mailer 
People were suggesting that someone write a mailer with PGP
support, and because my site uses lots of PCs connected to an
internet host, I was thinking of using an SMTP-client based
system. That much I think I can do.
However, I am also now trying to learn to program for Windows,
and the idea of a windows based PGP is quite nice, and with an
integrated mailer it would be great.
Is anyone else working on either of these two things?
What are the implications (security wise) of using something    like windows where tasks aren't really that hidden from each
other and that swaps to disk?
I notice that PGP bothers to erase its stacks and work areas. It
seems that this would be a lot less possible under windows. Jim McGrath

Karl said: When PGP generates keys doesn't it always pick d and e to have
the same number of bits, ie 446 for the strongest type?
Is this the same thing? I suppose that if you are allowed leading 0s it isn't a problem
at all, but if the first couple of bits were ones in each key, (a
16:1 chance) wouldn't that significantly reduce the power
required to factor the PK using this approach?
Just a thought,
