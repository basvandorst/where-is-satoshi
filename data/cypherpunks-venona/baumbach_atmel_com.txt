@_subject: How secure is an anonomous mail-server 
Suppose somone wanted to compromise an anonomous mail-server.  Couldn't it
be possible without the owner of the mail-server knowing?  The attack might
consist of monitoring all traffic to and from that address.  Unless the server waits a long and random time to forward the incoming mail, couldn't
a mapping be made of real-name/possible-anon-names?  If a users uses the
same anonomous name for long enough (2 times?) couldn't the attacker be
very confident of the mapping?  If the attacker uses the server themselves
creatively, wouldn't the task be even easier?  This seems like a simple cipher easily broken.
I am new to this, so I appologize if this is a dumb question.

My eyes have been opened, after reading the White House press release.
Privacy can only be allowed if the users don't break any laws.  If
through accident or other means we find that someone who is using privacy has broken the law, we need to be able to discover what has
been hidden by privacy in the past to see if other laws were broken.
It is for the greater good!  Let's have the gov't set a good example
for us too follow.  I want all government employees and anyone they
have spoken to, to be recorded always.  The tapes will be encrypted
and stored safely in the hands of all losing presidential candidates.
If a citizen has probable cause to believe that a person in gov't has
broken the law, then, with proper safeguards, he will be given copies
of the appropriate tapes and the keys, to get to the bottom of this.

the gov't having the keys.  These people came to this conlusion on their
own.  The sources of their information might be biasing their view. :-)
I heard a commentary on National Public Radio that was against it!
Keep up the fight.  It's not a loosing battle.
There is also a bright side to this battle.  Look at all the free publicity
that privacy has gotten.  Our gov't has given ground in the early rounds of the negotiation by stating there is a right to encryption.  They want to
completely control that right to encryption, and this we will fight and win.
I recommend telling people about the freedom and privacy gained in other
countries by their use of PGP.  Tell them that the secret police can no
longer spy on their citizens as effectively.

I have an encryption question:
Has anyone tried to create a strong encryption algorithm that cannot
be broken by brute force?  If the algorithm relied on a dictionary,
for instance, then the wrong key could still return something that
resembles english.  It would be even better if for any arbitrary text,
a KEY could be generated which maps the encrypted real message to
the arbitrary text.  With this system, even if your true key could be figured out (maybe
you wrote it on a napkin!), you could easely deny the accuracy of
the decryption.  A decrypted message would only be useful for
information, but never for evidence.  This is more of an idea than a question.  What do you think?

A custom one color t-shirt can be had for $27.60. 2 @ $15.90 each. 4 @ $10.10 each. 12 @ $6.20 each.  This is not silkscreening, it is fabric dye based laser printer toner.
You can actually do all this on your own laser printer, but the cost
above is for a finished product.  The company sells supplies or will
do it all for you.  You might want to ask for a sample of their
product before ordering anything.
They also publish a magazine: Flash   The premier Journal of Desktop Printing
The ad as seen in their magazine follows:
Transfer Services
  We can reproduce photographs, drawings, artwork or computer graphics on
a variety of products using our Transfer Toner technology.  We will color
separate your photos or artwork to create full color transfers.  The prices below are for projects where you provide us with camera ready artwork.
Design sizes are shown in parenthesis after item names.  Larger designs can
often be accomodated with one or more Additional Designs.  Designs may be
placed on the back, front, sleeve, cuff, & pocket.
  To use the chart below, simply match the product you want to the quantity you are ordering for the base price of the first color.  Next,
add in the cost per item for each additional color.  For full color photos & artwork add three more colors for a total of four.
  To receive these low prices artwork must be camera ready.  Single color
items should be in black ink on bright white paper.  Multicolor items
should be in their respective colors on one composite page.  High
contrast images will give the best results.  We also accept images on
3.5" Mac & PC disks in the follwing formats: ReadySetGo, TIFF, MacDraw,
MacPaint, Illustrator, & PjotoShop.  Files should be print erady and clearly
labeled.  Include any special fonts as outlines.  Be sure to keep a backup
of all artwork.  We attempt to return all originals, but can not be
responsible for their loss or damage.
  Our artists can create or modify a design at the rate of $45/hr billed
by the quarter-hour.  Simple jobs like curved text might be 15 minutes.
  Full scale mockups are available at the Q1 pricing and are 75% deductible against orders placed within 30-days of Q12 for that same item.

The magazine seems to have separated from the toner company.
For what it's worth, the masthead has CIS:[73130,1734].  I think
that's a Compuserve address, and offhand I don't know how to
send mail to one, yet I know it's possible.  The 2 companies
probably have employees in common.
I have never actually done business with this company, but from reading
their magazine I have a good feeling about them.  I considered going
into the t-shirt printing business using this companies products, but
for now I am still a wage slave.

@_subject: TECH: encrypted computer? 
Here's something I've been thinking about:
Is it possible to create a computer system based on encryption?  Could
you have a computer that does not just increase the program counter for
each instruction, but instead jumps around forward and back based on
a combination of an encrypted program and a public key?  Without the
public key, the computer would never know what the next instruction was.
If you try to watch the execution, to figure out the order, you can't
tell if the next address was chosen because it's just next or if it
was chosen as the result of a comparison.  A new encryption/decryption
algorithm would need to be invented so as to securely hide how the
next address was chosen.  Decryption hardware would have to be created
so things run fast enough.  There is lots of other things to be worked
out, but is it possible?
If it is possible, software piracy is given a major blow with such a system.
Have any particular program encrypted with a different private key for
each customer.  Compile the name of the purchaser into the program code,
and then tracing illegal copies to the leak is trivial.
In case it's not clear above, the whole system is based on encryption.
It is not just a matter of the executable being encrypted.  I don't
want the owner to be able to decrypt the executable and run that, he
has to run it encrypted.

This means to me, that you cannot patent a broad claim, until you have a
narrow specific example of it.  Anti-gravity had prior art, public key
systems did not.  If without inventing a public key system, someone had
described the concept in general terms, then prior art would exist for
this as well.  The person who invented the wheel (or sled?) might have
been able to have claims broad enough to cover hovercrafts.

Where does this interest come from.  If you have a 100% backed currency

Continuing with Alice and Bob, let's add Carl.  If Carl needs his freezer

can supply them, a currency is still unneeded.  Suppose, however, Alice
wants the vegetables, but has nothing to offer Carl, a "barter currency"
would solve her need.  Alice pays Carl for the vegetables.  Carl pays
Bob for repairing his freezer.  Alice pays Bob for cleaning her street.
Bob pays Alice once for the vegetables, and once for her to prepare them
to his liking.  A small economy becomes facilitated.  Useful stuff has

these people own gold before their economy can function?

I stumbled onto a pair of programs called seejunk.exe and prune.exe this
past week.  It seems that files are stored on disk media in fixed units
called clusters.  Your file size is usually not an integral multiple of
disk clusters in size, so the ends of your file is followed by random
data to fill up that last cluster.  Random is a bad choice of words
though.  I suppose each system is different, but under DOS, the extra
fill data is a copy of a piece of whatever you had in memory at the time
your system wrote the file.  You could have information written to disk
that you do not wish to have there, and seejunk.exe will show it to you
... and anyone else.  prune.exe is the solution offered.  Using this
program, I wrote "This space intentionally left blank " repeating in
the 5K of space sitting at the end of the doc file for these two programs.
 That was the risk and the fix available.  There is also an opportunity
here.  Encrypted information could be stored at the end of your files.
In other words this is an opportunity for steganography.  You would
have to be careful though; any disk operation involving that file could
corrupt your encrypted data.
 I don't have full access to the internet.  If someone finds these
programs on the internet, can they post the location here.  If the
files aren't on the internet, I can email them to anyone that wants
