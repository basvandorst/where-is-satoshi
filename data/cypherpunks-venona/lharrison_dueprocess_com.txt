The Government Has Our Numbers
by Lori Patel 4:00am  3.Jul.98.PDT
Your banker has it. Your employer has it. Your insurer, the IRS, and,
frankly, you can't remember who else has it. So what difference does it
make if the US Department of Transportation joins the crowd asking to see
your Social Security number?
Recently, the department published its intention to require all states to
verify Social Security numbers before issuing or renewing drivers'
licenses.  Depending on who one asks, the significance of this decision can
swell or shrink like a top-notch
special effect. "Fear of crime and terrorism has caused us to let down our guard against
excessive intrusion into the lives of the law abiding. The ease of minor
borrowing and the transformation of shopping into recreation has addicted
us to credit cards," wrote
New York Times columnist William Safire. "Taken together, the fear and the
ease make a map of our lives available to cops, crazies, and con men alike."

Could be because, at least from what I read in the report and from other
sources, Monica came onto Clinton.  One could make the argument that the
imbalance of power was the other way around ;)
On another note, instead of the report, it may be extremely more
interesting to read:
I can't vouch for the veracity of all of those listed.  Of those
individuals, however, with whom I am familiar by way of the media, it is
accurate - and eerie, to say the least.

My mistake.  Sometimes when you're reading a post that's been re-quoted
several times, it gets confusing as to who posted what.
I don't see a power imbalance here.  If a young woman in her 20's
invitingly flashes her thong panties at a man, I don't see how she can be
portrayed as the victim.  The only way that the issue of power arises is
that Monica was not overwhelmed by someone in power - she was attracted to
the power.
On another but connected note, explain why Monica saved that dress!  I
found this little tidbit to be the "yuck" factor...

What law?  This was consensual sex.  No law was broken.  Judgment and
morality, of course, are different issues.
Clinton, like anyone else, is required to tell the truth when being deposed
or testifying in front of a Grand Jury, i.e., making any statement under oath.
I'm not in a position to comment because I'm not sure who the major players
were at the time the legislation was enacted.  Generally speaking, when the
president belongs to Party A, the majority of the Legislature belongs to
Party B.
Regarding political parties, I am an NPA (no party affiliation) and can
only vote in general elections.  I made this choice because I do not wish
to be "pigeon-holed" by a label imposed upon me as a result of belonging to
a given political party.  In the same vein, I am unable to speak for
"feminists", "normal people", "politicians", etc.  I speak only for myself. ;)

@_subject: LAST WORD: Re: Clinton--Why I am Chortling 
Bill -
I was pointing out that one (male or female) doesn't save such items of
unwashed clothing unless there's a distorted reason for doing so.  Like
you, I can only speculate as to why, but it reflects a premeditation on her
part - which supports my position that she's not a *victim*.
A woman who comes on to her male employer and, when he accepts her
"invitation", cannot turn around and allege: "Poor me.  I was a victim.  He
is so powerful."  I don't give a damn whether her employer was the
President or the chief janitor.  To contend otherwise is to suggest that
*every* woman in an executive position, private or public, slept her way to
get the position because of the initial imbalance of power.  I do not
accept this.
Clinton has chased skirts for most of his adult life (as an article which
was posted points out). As the "chaser", he's used his various positions of
power to his advantage, and I agree wholeheartedly that there's an
imbalance of power when he acted in this manner.
So, my bottom (and final) line is:
1.  Clinton has been a womanizer for most, if not all of his political life;
2.  Monica was not a victim in _this_ scenario;
3.  Clinton is guilty of perjury;
4.  Clinton used his friends to publicly support his lie and publicly
disgraced his daughter (Hillary's been through this before);
5.  My tax money has been spent to publish a report that he engages in
extra-marital sex and lies about it (gee, a real surprise!); and
6.  Even if I "Don't Get It" - Bill damned sure got it, and got it, and got
it... ;)

@_subject: RE: Quick, Dear -- Beat Me 
Absolutely, and it is not limited to credit cards.  It would pop up if, for
example, you buy a new car.  If your rating does become negatively
affected, the creditor could care less about your explanation of some Joe
Anonymous using your SSN.  His first question would be why didn't you
report it when you found out.  Whatever credit you'd be applying for would
get unbelievably mired in beaucracy - something you wouldn't need.
Additionally, it can mushroom in other areas as well.  This other person is
getting credit for the number of years that you have been employed.  Also,
if s/he applies for SSD or SSI (disability or supplemental security
income), you will be impacted upon.  Some states require SSN's for driving
licenses, and there's a myriad of potential problems here as well.  Tax
returns can potentially become a complication.  And the list goes on....
All in all, you should seriously reconsider your decision of not reporting
the problem.
