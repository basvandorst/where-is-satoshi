@_subject: Banning Laptops! 
favorite alt. newsgroup when the news on the t.v mentioned something about
banning laptops and cd players on airplanes. The story did not mention any
reason behind this ban on our favourite machines except quote " something is
causing problems to  our intsruments and we can't figure out what "
Anyway I'm just wondering what will happen to those new planes that have ports
on the seats. So that we can download our e-mail. ( Would we still call it
downloading even if we were flying over the site we were downloading the e-mail
from )                             ^^^^

@_subject: HDTV Markey hearings! 
flipping through the channels today and caught the last few minutes of the Markey Hearings on HDTV and digital broadcasting on C-Span. I wonder if anybody caught this and could e-mail me about it or posting it on this list.
(The outcome of it).
Does anybody know if it was broadcated on internet radio or the mbone?.
