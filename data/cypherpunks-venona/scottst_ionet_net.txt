@_subject: Pegasus Mail 2.20 
The new beta release of Pegasus Mail (one of the better e-mail
apps available) has a new feature:
     --------------------------------------------------------------
    Runtime-loadable encryptor/decryptor modules for Pegasus Mail.

The hot topic on everyone's lips is "privacy". And, as usual, the
computer industry is in the process of confusing and disrupting the issue
beyond recognition... We have factions all over the place each arguing
passionately for its own most beloved encryption scheme, and some of the
rhetoric is getting pretty heated.
Add to the proliferation of interests the USA's ridiculous export laws on
encryptors and the sum is trouble. As far as I can tell, encryption is
going through what seems to be an industry-standard cycle of chaos:
everyone suddenly realises there's a lack/opportunity/need and rushes to
promote the idea they like best; a small war develops during which the
users and peripheral developers are left bemused and bewildered amongst
the welter of extravagant claims and counter-claims, then eventually
(usually after two or three years of total pandemonium) the group with
the most clout (although not necessarily the best product) will win out
and become "the standard".
I've been through this rat race several times and have no desire whatever to go through it again; on the other hand, my USERS have very legitimate concerns about privacy. So what do I do? Easy - I pass the buck.
WinPMail v2.2 and later supports third-party, runtime loadable modules to
handle encryption and decryption of mail. A special mechanism has been
defined that allows Pegasus Mail to detect that a third party encryptor
has been used and to determine whether the matching decryptor is
available on the system. The built-in encryptor will remain available for
those sites who only need moderate levels of message security.  WinPMail
will define an open interface for third-party encryptors and it is then
up to other people to write the code. What I envisage actually happening
is people writing "shell interfaces" for WinPMail - i.e., modules that
take the calls I make and translate them into calls to other programs,
such as PGP or whatever, returning the result.
   Let the games begin.

from the Nando Times-
DENVER (Jan 20, 1996 01:16 a.m. EST) -- A college student's request to look at
the electronic mail of several high-profile state politicians got lawmakers'
attention Friday.
Becky O'Guin, a senior journalism student at Metropolitan State College of
Denver and a reporter for The Capitol Reporter, a student newspaper that covers
legislative action, stirred up the ruckus.
She sent a letter to Sen. Charles Duke, R-Monument, asking for all of his e-mail
messages from Jan. 1 to Jan. 16 and cited the Colorado Open Records Act as her
right to get it.
The letter noted that Colorado law would force him to pay court costs and
attorney fees if a member of the public "has to take official action to enforce
his or her right to view a public record."
That really miffed legislators.
Lawmakers said they'd get a legal opinion on whether they must disclose their
electronic-age messages and may pass legislation to make sure their messages
have some protection of privacy.
Senate Majority Leader Jeff Wells, R-Colorado Springs, said he and Senate
President Tom Norton, R-Greeley, got similar requests, but verbally.
Personally, Wells said, he believes e-mail is privileged information unless it
is specifically identified as public information under existing law.
A bill by Sen. Paul Weissmann, R-Louisville, to make e-mail as privileged as
telephone conversations was killed in a Senate committee.
A somewhat stronger bill still rests in the House.
O'Guin, meanwhile, was standing her ground, although she admitted to being a
little surprised about the uproar.
"The way I read the open records statute, those are open records," O'Guin said.
"I was very serious about the request. What I was looking for was to find out
how much public business is conducted through e-mail.
"If they're using e-mail to send memos back and forth discussing public
business, I see that as public record," she said. "Most of them don't (have
e-mail), but about 30 people have software that allows them to send e-mail back
and forth."
She said only Duke and Gov. Roy Romer have been sent letters so far, but she
intends to send them to other high-profile politicians.
Jim Carpenter, press secretary for Romer, said his office was "looking at all
the issues, all the options."
Duke said he has always complied with requests for public records, but said the
request for e- mail messages goes too far.
"I'm disturbed by it," Duke said.
(John Sanko writes for the Rocky Mountain News in Denver.)
   OK, if _I_ can't read your e-mail Mr. Legislator, why should you
be able to read _mine_?

I _am_ a GEnXer, and I worshipped Jules Bergmann as a child. Some
of my first memories is pressing my nose up to the tv, watching Saturn
V's lifting off. If I ever win the lottery, I'm going to take the Saturn that's lying on it's side at Cape Kennedy, refurbish it, and launch that baby just to watch it go. ;-)))

   I have to give Janet some credit for persistance, after all the events of the last week, she's still pushing the four horsemen.
Let's see, Dole, Clinton... Do I get another choice?
