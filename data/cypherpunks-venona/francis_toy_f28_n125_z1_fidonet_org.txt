I know that this is probably not the appropriate time or place to post,
however, if you are a true lover of Science Fiction literature, please
access the FIDONET SCI-FI LIT conference on your local BBS(if available).
Things are more or less dead over there, and stand a chance of disappearing
altogether without your support(posting messages)!
