@_subject: Canon Color Copiers 
X-Reposting Policy: Don't redistribute without permission. Rev.1.0.1
With a friend, I conducted an experiment.
We took two one dollar bills.
We tried to copy each one on a Canon CLC 550 (aka Canon Color copier).
The side with George Washington on it copied fine.
The other side didn't.
We adjusted the bills so we exposed only half of each bills; that is the top and bottom half and the right and left half.
The bottom have copied while the top half didn't.
The Left half copied (side with The Great Seal) while the right
half didn't.
We assumed then it was finding something located in the
upper right half of the back of the dollar bill. When we attempted to isolate that part of the bill, it DID copy.
Strange. Perhaps someone could look at a 1, 5, 10, 20
and 100 dollar bill and see if there is anything in common
in the upper right half of the back of those bills.
Interestingly, when we did isolate the upper right half even
though it copied, it didn't copy cleanly. You might ask, "How good are the copies."
My friend thought they were not great, while I thought
they were pretty good. As we were leaving the copier and
cleaning up after ourselves, the truth was revealed. My friend tried to pick up one of the "copied" dollars. My friend then
remarked, "I guess it is not such a bad copy."

As I have long predicted, clipper has a likely chance of going into

Cable systems need strong cypto to prevent not only theft of their

to hide what you are ordering on pay per view, your credit card numbers,
etc,) and when they offer voice services they will also need to encrypt
your voice....

Basically they have in the "system" a pointer to the memory location

This is important for a reason I have spoken here before about..
Law Enforcement loves to talk about how digtial tech will make things

easier. (today to tap into a DS-3 trunk, looking for a DS-0 channel,
you need to de-mux and pull out all the DS-1 channels, find the DS-1
that contains the DS-0 you want, and then de-mux that to get into and

3) Offer a free upgrade problem for people who have a server that has
   had a security breach. They can download a known secure server.
   This upgrade is for any commercial server browser that has a known
   breach. E.g., update a netsite server but not a CERN 3.0 server even

Here is some more information on the Checkfree Wallet (tm) system. I've
learn about it from some reporting I've been doing on it..
1) Has there been any public review of this product?
Here is the basic run down
It uses a 768-bit key. They claim it is not escrow-ed with the US
government. It is export able to most countries except for Sudan, Cuba,
North Korea, Syria, Libya, Iraq ot Iran.
It encrypts limited bits of information (like Credit Card Numbers)
which is why they claim it was able to get export approval.
User configures the Wallet(tm) by downloading and installing and
configuring it. It works with Proxy servers which I have
successfully tested.
It generates a public and private key pair using RSA technology.
It keeps the payer anonymous to the merchant via the internet. Merchants can learn the payer's name out of band (e.g., by phone).
No credit card info is stored on a merchant's site.
Payment is encrypted and signed buy the payer and sent to the merchant
who add's there version of the transaction and their signature. It is
forwarded to check free who then decrypt, compare the payers' and
merchant's view of the transaction and if they agree process it.
It use is very very quick and easy. It auto configures itself to
Netscape. Payment information is sent to the Wallet (TM) from the
merchant in a Mime segment, which triggers a launch of the Wallet, the
payer binds in their credit card data (all ready at Checkfree (at
installation) e.g., which card to use. Then the whole thing is sent to
the merchant then the onto Checkfree for processing as indicated
I was very impressed with the software and it's easy of use. Currently
only works on Windows but soon on the Mac..

The Internet has the potential to set us free -- to learn anything and
do anything, whenever we want. No wonder politicians want to regulate
it -- The Washington Post, November 7, 1995, p. A13., Cyber Liberation

The thing is that at "best" the Iphone people (et al), are sell
Equipment!. NO ONE is SELLING phone service.. I mean Selling phone
service means some guy in NYC putting a sign on a store front offering
10 cents a minute calls "anyway where in the world."
When you or I use Iphone (etc), we are not selling anything.. Tarrifs
are for Selling.. Not "personal use." The only one selling anything is
IDT with there plans to have Iphone like calls start in the US go to
europe via the Internet and then switch them to regular POTS lines for
the call completion..
Any Legal options here?
Btw. the worst thing is all the phone companies are very very good
a lobbying... congress, the FCC, etc.
ALso once FCC regulations something commmerical speach becomes "restricted."
Eg., tobbaco ads..

I've taken Ritalin as both an adult and a child. It is by experiance
not a sedative. It helps me focus more and increase my attention span.
It is as perry indicates a amphetamine.

My view point on this is that there will always be unmetered use but
it will ALWAYS have a lower priority. That if you want to ensure that
the download your doing or the internet phone call you placing gets
through you'll have to pay it bit...
You pay for faster routing
You will pay for priority access
You will pay for transaction control and measure and monitoring..
If you don't care about those things.. and will surf on the left over
bits' i'm sure it will always be unmetered.
