@_subject: Re: please stop the Mitnick stuff 
I don't usually rant, but nobody (Anonymous) said:
 Perry, give it a break.  Mitnick's case has to do with security
 as well as the violations of privacy and/or search and seizure
 government used to arrest him.
 may not be cryptography per se, but are you going to seriously argue
 security, etc. is not encompassed in crypto issues?
 found it interesting.  If you didn't, then all you had to do was
 it.  No one needs to read your personal crusade as *The One*
 tells us what's relevant and what's not.
I too found it interesting reading (agreeing with your position).  I too found it to be off-topic/off-charter (agreeing with Perry's position.)
It really torques me when someone suggests: (in response to someone else's suggestion that something was off-topic) "just delete it."  I subscribe to a lot of mailing lists and news groups.  Anything that contributes to the noise/signal ratio, and doesn't aplologize for it is a bad thing, IMHO.
To be more on-topic, if Mitnick knew more about crypto and covert ops, he probably woudln't have been caught as easily.  When he was caught, the feds probably wouldn't have been able to gather as much evidence against him.
I'll stop ranting, now.  You probably don't know me, and probably don't care about why I don't care to read alt.fan.kevin.mitnick stuff on the cypherpunks list.
