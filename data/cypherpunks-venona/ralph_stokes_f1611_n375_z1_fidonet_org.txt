@_subject: Beware of Roman Catholic Corruption 
Beware of the Satanic conspiracy of the WHORISH Roman Catholic Church.  The
Pope and his puppets have attempted to infiltrate and subvert the
Protestant Christian church using corrupt modern translations of the Bible.
These are nothing more than religious filth that have spewed forth from the
deceitful pens of Satan-inspired men in league with the Vatican.  Don't
let them lure you into following them into Hell.  The 1611 Authorized (King
James) Version of the Holy Bible is the only book that God ever wrote.  All
other alleged translations are frauds written by the Devil himself.
For further information regarding this damnable Satanic conspiracy, contact
