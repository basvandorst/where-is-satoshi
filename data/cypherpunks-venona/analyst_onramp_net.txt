Why not just use alt.test (with appropriate IGNORE subject line),
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica with your data steagonograpically hidden in a
JPEG or any other agreed upon group. Many anon posts would be quite
irritating, esp. on a high volume list such as this one.

@_subject: Pseudonymous ID cards? 
On the bright side, at least the Clinton administration is trying to stir
up interest in privacy issues amongst the general public.
Between the administration's support of Clipper, National ID cards,
National Health cards and Digital Telephony (have they supported this
yet?), there should start to be a lot of public interest in these issues.
Personally, rather than _just_ naysay everything that is being proposed
(which I will do, strongly), I would like more concrete recommendations and
proposals to make on the positive side that use technologies like digital
signatures and reputations to *protect* privacy while still allowing many
of the familiar sorts of social/economic interactions that we take for
granted. Perhaps we can pull an Aikido maneuver on this sudden gov power
grab (ok,ok, pretty far-fetched).
But, short of tracking down the Scientific American article from a couple
of years ago and re-reading it (and I'm sure it's out of date), I'm not
really sure what we can do with pseudonymous reputations and whatnot given
the current state-of-the-art.
So, I'd like suggestions, comments about alternative ways of establishing
digital IDs, insurance cards, credit cards, etc. that protect privacy
instead of divulge it, while still providing some of the societal controls
that we have come to expect (e.g. that drunk drivers will be deprived of a
license to drive).
Do we have alternative suggestions to make in this dark hour so that we can
actually win back some of our privacy? Can these sorts of technologies be
implemented in a way that is understandable by the average citizen-unit?

I wonder what exactly Justice and/or the spooks have on Clinton that's so
effective? Or are he and Gore actually as stupid as they act?

@_subject: Re:"True Names," chat with Vinge, and Cypherpunks 
Any newer Vinge estimates of arrival time for the Singularity? I saw an
article a while back by Vinge and I think he was estimating 2013-2030
I've been thinking of starting a Singularity Watch type Web-page/email
list, as I am often struck by technological newsbits that seem enough
out-of-the-ordinary and potentially status quo shattering that they seem to
indicate some sort of potential for breakthrough.
Some recent examples:
*human genome project
*quantum mechanical teleportation
*high energy ion bombardment of nuclei in Germany yields something besides
quarks, gluons in protons (potential challenge to QCD, is this our
photoelectric effect finally?)
*quantum computing
Despite the romantic appeal of the idea, though, I think it is a bit
farther off than Vinge imagines--maybe 2050.

*New Hampshire--alcohol sales (state run liquor stores), anything else?
*Alaska--lots of oil.

@_subject: Re: e$ : NetBank 
8 digit numbers only. No internal checksums or verification. Merchants must
send an email message to verify that the money is previously unspent and
receive fresh bills.
Agree about ungainliness. They aren't yet set-up with PGP or PEM, although
they say they are looking into it, so they currently suggest that if you
want to send encrypted mail, that you generate a key to be XOR'd with all
messages to and from. They do provide the C code for the encryption, though
From reading all of the info from the above infobot, it looks like they
only charge the 20% once, to the merchant when he tries to redeem
e-certificates for $USD, which they will pay out at the end of each month.
They claim in their docs that the 20% is the cost of their 900 number
service, so I suppose their business plan is to make money on the float,
since they are not charging transaction fees for making change, verifying
e-cash, etc.
If they accepted credit cards they might be in much better shape.
I would much rather see real Chaum-style electronic money, but have not yet
received a response after signing up for their beta test.
I wonder if NetBank's style of serialized e-certificates provide the 75% of
the functionality that most people need to ignore better alternatives,
especially if, as with Pr0duct Cypher's money, their is a big learning
curve to go up before they can use it.
Any pointers to other near-term e-cash systems? I am very interested in
setting this up for relatively small transactions (<$50) in the
not-to-distant future.
Thanks for info.

@_subject: RE: New Threat on the Horizon: Software Key Escrow 
Any word from Apple? Given their past relationship with RSA (built in to
PowerTalk) and without the threat of an antitrust suit, are they going to
sell out as well?
(I define sell-out to mean unavoidable key escrow built-in to the operating
system--the gov will eventually require that they get a copy in this case,
as others have mentioned)
Tim, it looks like it may not take 6 months after all. When is the Hard
core privacy seminar, anyway?
