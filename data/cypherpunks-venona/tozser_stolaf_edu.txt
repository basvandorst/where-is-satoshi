Stuff like this makes me sick. What the hell is up with these people!? You
offended me so you must leave. Well, excuse me, there is a reason internet
addresses have a WWW URL. It stands for World Wide Web and as such encompasses
the world. If there is stuff in the world that offends someone, don't look! But
to tell everyone else that they can't either since some were offended, that is
a starting point for cencorship. Now it's porn, tomorrow it's you saying what
you beleive (that might also be the truth...)
If one is offended by something, don't look! How come Catholicism doesn't get
banned and outlawed? Hell, it offends me... Guess not people!

If you show me an algorythm that calculates the real number TT (=3.14.....)
I'll give you a Nobel Prize personally!

Exactly! This is called recursive definition. To get the p-th set in the
sequence you need to find p-1 first...

Well, that is not entirely true... The length of any arbitrary line can be any
number, rational, natural, etc. Real numbers are the numbers that defy all
other categorization (they are not rational, irrational, natural, etc.) They
are complex and despite any instinctual perception, there are a lot of them!
I don't know if these maed a lot of sense but all of these questions are
answered in a good Elementary Real Analysis book.
