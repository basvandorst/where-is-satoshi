"Encyphering minds want to know."
The recent opening of One Time Pad season was a resounding success, with
previously unknown competitors Internet.Security.Guaranteed throwing out the first troll.  Unfortunately, the annual cypherpunk contest may have
to be renamed as it has been discovered that the phrase "One Time Pad"
has been trademarked by the Kotex division of Johnson & Johnson.  A second
entrant, Stonewall-Drawbridge, was disqualified when it was found that
the so-called "Infinite Venegere Key (IVK)" is the same one used by the
New York Times for its popular Sunday Cypher series.
Dr. Fred Cohen, noted virus expert and President of Info-Sec, recently announced the discovery of a new Internet security threat, the telnet
bomb.  First discovered when Dr. Cohen found, to his surprise, that people were actually trying to access the information that Info-Sec
was posting on the Internet, this insidious attack seems to only go
after sites that are getting down on their knees and begging for it by
announcing to the world that people are actually trying to access our site
and if you don't stop, we're going to tell the CERT and the FBI on you.
Info-Sec quickly announced its solution, a $20,000 "Air Wall" (tm)
turnkey computer with it's serial ports and ISA and PCI bus slots filled
with crazy glue.
Tim May's IQ dropped ten points today after the noted cypherpunk and retired
Intel engineer was stopped at the Mexican border by Customs agents, who
seized and confiscated over two hundred grams of an "unspecified pharmaceutical substance".  Mr. May was released on his own recognizance
when presented with an Alta Vista list of over two hundred aliases he
has used to post to various Internet newsgroups and mailing lists and
admitting, "Yup, that's me!".
Eric Blossom has announced that CPLite is NOT out of business, but the S/N ratio has been so low for the past month that no posts made it through
the CPLite filtering system.  Not a single subscriber has requested a
refund, claiming, en masse, "Hey, that's what we pay him for!".
Asgaard's popular web site, a revisionist view of Viking history, has relocated to c2.org after being shut down by his original ISP due to complaints from the French government, which has declared as illegal

Surfwatch today reinstated access to AOL after the Wall Street Journal
explained that their claim that AOL was "getting into bed with Bill Gates"
was standard business school terminology and did not refer to consensual

Jim Bell died this week when a homemade "nuclear detonator" exploded in his
hands.  The detonator was immediately awarded the over ten thousand dollars
bet on Mr. Bell in the Blacknet "Dead Pool" when the committee decided that
the detonator had correctly predicted Mr. Bell's time and place of death,
and that the prediction of "death by radiation poisoning" was "close
enough for cypherpunk work."

several female employees of First Virtual reported that he had been

"Encyphering minds want to know."
The Enquirer has strong evidence that a group of well known cypherpunks
is using the nym Jim Bell in a conspiracy to wheedle a free legal education
out of the Black Unicorn.  As one of the anonymous unindicted co-conspirators
stated recently on the semi-secret coderpunks mailing list, "If Mr. Bell
had not already existed, we probably would have been forced to invent him."
Mr. Bell has pleaded innocent to charges that he is assisting the group,
stating that his judgement was impaired by the ingestion of large quantities
of sugar in the form of Hostess chocolate covered cupcakes, otherwise know as
the "Ding Dong Defense".
Microsoft announced today that it has achieved B1 Orange Book security on
a Windows NT box by encasing the computer in concrete and sinking it to the
bottom of the Marianas Trench.  C2 security had previously been attained
for Windows 95 by adding a warning message that the C2 rating was voided by any use of the I/O bus.  In other news, the DoD has announced it is
suing c2.org for unauthorized appropriation of the C2 security designation.
A DoD spokesperson stated that, "they can use the C2 designation all they
want to as long as they don't hook it up to a network."
Novell has announced that all future versions of Netware will abandon their
proprietary IPX protocol, in favor of IPv6.  "That way," claimed a Novell
spokesperson, "we won't have to worry about Netware 5.0 for at least a
couple of years, and if we still can't get it out in time, we'll just
announce that we're waiting for PGP 3.0." Timothy May is spending his recuperative time in the Corralitos General
Hospital learning some Spanish.  Mr. May suffered a broken nose, a sprained
neck, and multiple bruises and contusions in a local Mexican restaurant after
a friend jokingly told him that the Spanish translation of "Where's the
restroom?" was "Puta tu madre".
Perry Metzger announced a new theoretical attack on so-called 'smart card'
technology such as the Fortezza card.  Using the newly developed
Continuous Atomic-Level Asynchronous Magnetic Array Resonance Interferometer,
Mr. Metzger speculated that it should be possible to train a school of
the little nanotechnological wonders (also affectionately known as
"Detweilers" because of their many tentacles) to swim up a PCMCIA port
and back out the NSA's secret trap door with code fragments clutched in
their suction cups.
Raph Levien lost an important court case recently, when a federal judge ruled that his son (born March 17, 1996) will legally be known as Alan
Mathison Levien until he's old enough to decide for himself whether he
wants to be named after his PGP key fingerprint.
Netscape Communications announced today that they were launching a hostile
takeover bid of $35/share for Lance Cottrell in order to get his highly
coveted export-controlled ftp site technology.  Netscape engineers,
stymied after a year and a half of effort to code a secure export-
controlled ftp site, have hailed the new acquisition.  Jeff Weinstein,
Electronic Munitions Specialist at Netscape, stated, "Now we'll finally be
able to offer the same RC4 128 security to our beta testers as we offer
to our regular clients.  Non-domestic users, unfortunately, will still
have to install it themselves by copying it off the T-shirts." Employees of the FBI have banded together to purchase director Louis Freeh
a cowboy belt with his name embossed on the back, so that when the proctologists at Bethesda Naval Hospital finally get his head unstuck, he'll be able to see who he is.
After a recent discussion of WWII "codetalkers" on the cypherpunks mailing
list, the NSA and DoD have banned Native Americans of Navahoe descent
from leaving the country without first filing a CJR.
The sale of Internet Security Guaranteed to the Elementrix Corporation for
one dollar was cancelled today after San Francisco securities analysts
Hambrecht and Quist declared ISG 'overvalued'.
CERT has announced the first discovery of a computer 'prion'.  The prion,
which affects only Microsoft's Explorer web browser, causes the victim's
hard drive to slowly fill with holes until his data turns to mush.  Bill
Gates reportedly started foaming at the mouth when told of the new threat
to Internet security, causing Microsoft employees to dub the new affliction
"Mad Bill Disease", which resulted in Mr. Gates being banned in Britain. Next in the Enquirer:  Direct from the CDA hearings, Marty Rimm and

The Enquirer's Public Service Award for this month goes to ABC Evening
News, which, after noting that 25% of America's children have access to
bomb-making instructions via the Internet, proceeded to provide those
instructions to the 75% without Internet access.  ABC News President Roone

available household ingredients, stating that "In the interest of public
safety, we omitted the final instruction to 'light the fuse and run like
The Cypherpunk Academy of Codes and Cyphers recently announced a new
nomination for the Perry Award.  The nomination for this prestigious award,
given to the cypherpunk who has done the most in the past year to increase
the S/N ratio of the list, goes to Alex de Joode, for shutting down the
famed Hacktic remailer and refusing to confirm or deny that the reason was
actually the fact that the entire staff of Hacktic, Int. has recently
converted to the Church of $cientology.  The resulting rumors set of a wave
of paranoia on the list regarding the future of the remailer network, and
resulted in a few cypherpunks actually writing code for the first time in
recent memory.  Mr. de Joode, interviewed while peddling e-meter software
for $10,000 in Amsterdam's red light district, refused all comment. Curtis Sliwa had to return the $10,000 today when it was discovered that
the .gif of "a woman's genitals nailed to a board" that the CyberAngels
presented to the ACLU lawyers in the CDA appeal hearing was really a
photo of his wife Lisa's labial piercings.
Rich Graves finally got his Doctor of Divinity degree from the Universal
Life Church, and requests that from now on, list members refer to him

Sotheby's Auction House today announced that the famed "Black Window"
Java applet signed by Marianne Mueller has been sold for $2,500,000.
The rare applet, which can damage hard drive files even though it had
been signed and certified as "completely secure", was purchased by a
certain Wall Street Computer Security Consultant who wishes to remain
anonymous, and who placed his winning bid via anonymizer
Leon Panetta belatedly admitted today that hidden away in the small
print on page 1,237 of the Administration's latest "Law Enforcement
Access to Encrypted Internet Traffic" proposal, otherwise known as
Clipper III, was a section on the new "Republican Members of Congress FBI
File Escrow Service".
Logan promises to never again try to operate his Mac mail software
immediately after one of those late-night Beltway cocktail parties.
Former President Jimmy Carter was vindicated today when Jim Bell
announced that the strange markings on recently deceased ex-CIA Director
William Colby's canoe were indeed the result of rabbit bites.  Sandy Sandfort's tax avoidance consulting service collapsed today when it
was discovered that tax avoiders weren't any better at chaining remailers
that the average Windows95 user.

I finally lost the tail somewhere around the docks, and slowly worked my

"Vodka martini.  Shaken, not stirred," I said to Ratz, the regular bartender.
Ratz slammed the drink down on the counter in front of me.  "Shaken enough

Alice stared at the two strange creatures.  She was completely dumbfounded.
"So let me see if I've got this right.  You make really good wheels.  But
if the Queen of Hearts had wheels, her subjects who occasionally raid your
borders would be able to get away faster, and you wouldn't catch as many of
them.  Is that right, Tweedledumb?"
"I'm Tweedledumber.  He's Tweedledumb.  Yes, that's right.  We have a technological lead over the Cards, and we have to maintain it."
"So you won't sell them wheels?"
"Well, it's more complex than that.  A large part of our population is engaged
in making wheels, and we make a lot of money selling them to the Cards.  So
we made a compromise.  We only sell them SQUARE wheels."
"But of course," Tweedledumb chimed in, "it's very expensive to make both
square and round wheels.  So most of our people only make square wheels,
so they can sell them to both us and the Cards.  Of course, our people
are allowed to buy round wheels, IF they can find them."
"AND," stated Tweedledumber, "since the wheel is patented here, we get to
collect a hefty licensing fee for every wheel sold."
"But the Cards DO have wheels!"  Alice could see over the fence, and the
Cards were happily zipping around all over the place.  "And so do a lot of
people over here.  What happened?"
"Well, we couldn't stop the Cards from building their OWN wheels ... "
"And people like buying the Card wheels because they're faster than our
wheels, and they're cheaper, because they don't have to pay us the licensing fee ..."
"You see, we have a licensing treaty with the Cards for most things, so if
they make something we have a patent on, they have to pay us, but the wheel can't be exported, so it can't EXIST over there, so our patents don't
apply ... "
"But I don't understand!  You said you needed to catch people, but now you
can hardly catch anyone!"  Alice was totally astounded at what she was
"It's only a stopgap measure anyway."  Tweedledumber clasp his hands behind
his back and started pacing.  "We need to get an agreement with the Queen of
Hearts that both of our people will only use, oh, say, pentagonal and
maybe hexagonical wheels.  That way, everyone can get around faster, but
we'll still be able to catch them."
"But who's WE?"
"Anybody with a TLA on their shirt.  WE get round wheels."
"What's a TLA?"
Alice almost felt relieved when she saw the familiar grin materialize.  The
rest of the Cheshire Cat soon followed.
"A TLA, my dear, is a Three Letter Anachronism.  When people start referring
to you by your initials, you've overstayed your welcome.  If everyone starts
calling ME TCC, I'll know it's time to find another job."
The caterpillar spoke up from its perch on the toadstool.  "Wrong, tuna
breath.  TLA's are the only thing standing between society and total
Alice turned to face the caterpillar, who responded by blowing a lungful
of hookah smoke in her face.
"THESE two goons only deal with the dangers of the Queen of Hearts and her
soldiers, I have to worry about the domestic situation.  So we came up with
a solution.  There are certain unscrupulous locals who engage in terrible
things, terrorism, drug dealing, child molestation, money laundering ...
we have to be able to catch them.  If they had wheels, they could outrun
us.  But if we had ACCESS to those wheels when we needed it ... by the way,
speaking of drug dealers, we know about that mushroom, and the pills.  You
might want to think really hard about playing ball with us, the Queen of
Hearts is rather fond of cutting off dope addict's heads."
"Access to wheels?  Does that have anything to do with those ropes hanging
off the back of those carts?"
"Yup.  We pull on that rope, the wheels fall off.  And since we may have to
stop a LOT of people at one time, we could have a riot, or another Butthole
Surfers concert, we figure that we should be able to stop about
ten percent of the population at once, a little less in the rural areas ...
well, they've gotta be REALLY LONG ROPES ... and there have to be A WHOLE LOT
of them ... course, the ones with the ropes we let have octagonal wheels ... "
"But can't just anybody pull the rope?  You'll have wheels falling off all
over the place."
"Price you have to pay for a safe society.  Besides, we have trusted third
parties holding to to the other end."
"How will you get people to use it, when they can get regular wheels from the

wheel dealers - put the rope on or we shut you down.  Spread the word that
only criminals don't use ropes - what are you afraid of?  Got something to
hide?  Eventually we'll have to outlaw the round wheel, of course, but for
the time being, some creative social engineering should do the trick."  The
caterpillar took another long drag on the hookah.  "Good shit.  Dole was
right about this stuff."
"But can't people get real wheels for free?"
"Sure, we've pulled off enough they're lying around all over the place.  But
then you need an axle, bearings, steering - most people still just go down and buy the whole package.  We get them, we're in - guy up in Seattle makes
something like 90% of all carts sold here, you should see the shit we've got
on HIM!  No problemo.  And those idiots at Netscape - we've got them doing
a complete background check on anybody who wants a round wheel - come back
in five days, and maybe you can have it."
"So, Alice, are you learning anything?"
Alice liked the Cheshire Cat, but it did have very sharp teeth, and very long
claws, and it did have the habit of appearing out of nothing.  Alice felt
that it should be treated with respect.  "Not really, your cattiness.  It doesn't make any sense at all!"
"It isn't supposed to.  You have to look at it the right way.  From their
perspective, it makes perfect sense."
"I'm confused."
"Don't worry about it.  It gets worse before it gets better.  Come on, we're
going to a party.  Tim May and John Gilmore are throwing a Mad Tea Party."
"Are they really mad?"
"May's crazy as a loon.  You'll like him.  Gilmore, he's just still pissed
at Shimamura for that stunt in the hot tub ... "
