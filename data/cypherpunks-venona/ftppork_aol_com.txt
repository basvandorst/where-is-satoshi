It's people like Lt that give AOL a bad name... I am sorry to say I am a part
of it, but I just keep it because I don't feel like switching... ah well.
At least they have TCP/IP protocols now with Win 95
ex: Hiroshima 45, Tsjernobyl 86, Windows 95 (Please, correct my spelling if I misspelled Tsjernobyl)
Anyway, Lt... get real, this is Cypherpunks, not travel.

<< Hoppyhead,
 You'll have to wait until we supply the other AOLholes with the information
 they demanded on thrash music, hacking banks info, LSD manufacturing, and
 get rich quick schemes.
 We're struggling under the workload of millions of new AOL, PacBell,
 Earthlink, Prodigy, and other newbies who have just discovered the Net.

I take that statement as an insult, and it really isn't true about all of us
AOL users.  Of course, Hoppy was kinda stupid for asking something that
stupid, but we don't all care about thrash music, hacking banks info, LSD
manufacturing, and
 get rich quick schemes.  Actually, some of us know what real hacking is...
not just using scrolling programs and cracking banks (Both of which are
completely different) etc...
Anyway, try not to stereotype people so much, because, with the Advent of 32
bit AOL, we can actually use all of the TCP/IP protocols, etc...

I did not say anywhere that 32 bit would fix problems of cluelessness - or
ignorance in your case.  I said, it is a little better because we can now use
TCP/IP protocols.  Did I ever say that the people on AOL were smarter because
of it?  Well, let's go read over that post - - - nope... I didn't.  I think
some people should read a little more carefully, or just don't read at all.

Hey, could anyone tell me what process DES Encryption goes through, or point
me to a site with the information?
P.S. Please no flames because I am on AOL...
