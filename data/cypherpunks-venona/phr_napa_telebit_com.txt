  A lab proven method:  Take CD-ROM.  Place in standard kitchen microwave.   Set on high power cook for 5 seconds.  Press start.  Watch the action.   Hang resulting artifact on wall as curiosity, which is all it's good for
  now.  Let the wave air out a little (this won't fry it).
You should know better than this.  Microwaving cracks the aluminum
coating into a lot of small pieces, but almost all the pieces are
larger than a few square mm. even if you cook until quite "well done".
A few mm. of a CD is a *lot* of contiguous bits that could be
recovered by a determined enough adversary, and you likely wouldn't
ebe bothering with OTP's unless you're concerned with very determined
I agree with the person who griped that OTP's are making excessive
list traffic compared with interesting protocols, etc.
OTP's get rehashed on sci.crypt every few months, as that person
pointed out.

@_subject: Idea on Random Number Generators 
It is very hard to generate really random numbers no matter what you do.
See the famous RAND book "One Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal
Deviates" for their adventures trying to generate random numbers by
counting particle emissions from a radioactive source.  Even after
all kinds of statistical massaging there were still correlations in the

@_subject: Random Numbers Boxes and Cypher Processers 
Ok folks, sounds like its time to look into the guts of Telebits and
    XyZel's and see if we can make cypher-processers of them.  Both have
    real CPU's and DSP's, what more do you want?
Hardware devices tend to have barely enough processing power to do the function they were designed for---if there were some power
left over, the designers would have used a cheaper and weaker processor.
Why would you want to do encryption in your modem instead of on
the host cpu that the modem is talking to?

codec should be under $50 single quantity, the data rate isn't very
    high so you don't need much of a CPU (6811 might even be enough, and
    they're easy to interface to things -- lots of on-chip I/O). You'd
    need a modem-style encoder for the output (running digital from
    box-to-box -- "analog" scrambling (Time or Frequency domain) is way
    too easy to break) so maybe another $50 DSP chip... after all, you
    don't need to support 30 different baud rates, just one data rate with
    perhaps a low-line-quality backoff. The codec is pretty cheap, but you want a nice low bit rate so you can
send the encrypted data over the phone.  Some talk of how to do this
is happening on sci.crypt.  I have a scheme which I plan to float
around at the cypherpunks meeting on Saturday.  However, the hardware
ends up being on the expensive side ($150 or so).

Those of us who support the freedom to use cryptography, run PGP, and
write whatever programs we wish (cryptographic and otherwise) should
be aware that the boycott against Lotus and Apple is still on.  By
making PGP run on Macintoshes and with Lotus Notes, we improve the
usefulness of those systems and thereby help our enemies take away our

Everyone, please send the name of your email software to Eric, so
he can do useful and wonderful things with the information.
But please *don't* clutter the rest of the list with it.  Thanks.

Has anyone given any thought to generating random numbers by counting
particle emissions from a radioactive source?  This might be more
reliably random than using purely electronic means.

"...and just take the legal risks..."  Wellll, what is there to gain by
    taking legal risks, as opposed to doing a research gig where we're trading
    in pennies for fictitious goods & services...?  Please spell it out
    explicitly; there would have to be a very significant advantage to convince
    me to agree.  Like maybe that the govt is about to pull all cash out of
    circulation and this is our last hope....
How about a crypto poker game, or crypto diplomacy (with fictitious
money)?  This would allow us to try some coin flip protocols, zero
knowledge proofs etc. as well as crypto banking.  Of course, cheating
(trying to rig the coin tosses, spoof messages etc.) would be
encouraged!  That would allow us to find weak spots in the protocols,
which are supposed to prevent this from happening.  Then, at the next
physical meeting, people could describe what kinds of things they did,
and maybe the winner could get a small prize (e.g. be treated to
dinner by the rest of the players).

over dinner at a chinese restaurant -- this didn't start a trend,
    unfortunately :-) I haven't signed John Gilmore's key (even though I
    work for him) since I haven't actually seen him in person, though I
    may get a chance to when I'm in California next week -- this will
    create a link between east-coast and west-coast signatures, though
    possibly not the first.
If you meet someone claiming to be John Gilmore,
how will you know he's not an impostor?

@_subject: share room at RSA conference Thursday? 
Does anyone have crash space, or need some, at the Sofitel hotel on
Thursday night?  (I'm not sure if it's all booked up or what the
room rates are).
I live fairly close to Redwood City but figure that staying
at the conference hotel is the only way I'll have any chance
of getting up early enough for the 9:00 A.M. session on Friday.
I might also be interested in splitting up a room on Wednesday night
but the interesting sessions on Thurs. don't start til 10:45 a.m.
which is not quite as bad...
Please reply by direct email, as I'm not on the list any more.  Thanks.

@_subject: DES flushed from numerical recipes 
Fans of the Numerical Recipes book might like to know there's a second
edition out.  It includes quite a few improvements, and a much expanded
chapter on random number generation.  However, the DES routine from
the first edition has been flushed on the grounds that it was too slow
to be useful as an RNG.  Oh well.
