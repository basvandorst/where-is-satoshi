I recieved this this afternoon (11/9/96), this has gone far enough, would anyone here care to join me in mailbombing this guy?

about 100 times or so, if we get about 100 people to do this it should generate enough traffic to close his account down.
my reply to his mail is at the bottom:
Listen you spotty socially unskilled adolescent masturbator:
Your petty and pathetic claims amuse me, I laugh at your worthless and dirty existance peon.
What have you ever hacked, have you broken any encryption codes, have you found security weaknesses by new and ingenious methods, have you practised within the hacker ethic?
I think not
You are a *WANNABEE*, a punk who knows not the slightest thing about systems security, can`t code, and couldn`t hack his way out of a wet paper bag, your mailbombing threats are about as technical as you can in addition your flames show no linguistic creativity, just a bunch of crude words thrown together, get an education you trailer Mailbomb me, go ahead punk, make my day, if you dare to even think about doing so I will kick your ass, I will hurt you in ways you cannot imagine, I have carried out vindictive personal vendettas before and will do so again if necessary.
 Go on, I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker. Yours with the greatest respect:

If his true passion is fractals and raytracing, then why would he expend
energy things other than fractals and raytracing.  He may be an anarchict but wish
to invest his time in fractals and raytracing rather than in explaining anarchy.
If his true passion were re-mailers and anonymity then he would spend pages
and pages writing about them rather than just admitting to supporting them.
