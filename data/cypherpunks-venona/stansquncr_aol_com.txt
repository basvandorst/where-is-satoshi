Well, yes, that's what BXA flaunts, but I wonder if the encryption regs
are a high priority compared to the cases which are actually pursued
which deal with truly threatening technology that every congressperson
loves to fearfully hate. Yapping Chihuahua crypto is not up there yet, I suspect.
True, there's a batch of agents being trained to work specifically on
encryption, and with the total of crypto exports now exceeding $half a billion, it may be cost and politically effective to set an example by pounding one or two neo-crypto-Zimmermanns, especially as the
year's hearings rumble, troll and slumber.
Still, Adam's signature RSA-taunt has been on our Web site for months,
terminating each of his exemplary stream of messages on low perfidy in high places, to no effect on BXA's eagle eyeball.
Adam's 3-liner was also once part of Peter Junger's legal filings  (DoJ downloaded the evidence) until we were ordered to excise the tiny terrible Perl so that Peter's noble bite of the hand of god would be clearly his stiletto fangs and not confused with Sir Adam Bulldog's ass ripper.
Now, Declan, what would a crypto-miscreant need to do to actually get BXA's fierce kennel of crypto bloodhounds' attention, to make it truly
worth everybody's headline read, money, politics, talents and teeth?

Absolute Proof - Rush is a Liar!
First let's define 'liar' (from pages 670-671 of 'Merriam Webster's Collegiate
Dictionary, 10th
"Liar - one that tells lies"
That was easy, now it's a little more confusing, because of the number of
definitions (4). The first
two I will leave out, as they pertain to how you might 'lie' down, or where a
golf ball may 'lie'. The
3rd is the verb, and is inapplicable. I will use the 4th definition, the noun.
(4) "Lie (noun)- 1: a: an assertion of something known or believed by the
speaker to be untrue
with intent to deceive b: an untrue or inaccurate statement that may or may
not be believed true
by the speaker 2: something that misleads or deceives 3: a charge of lying"
By combining the two definitions,
(4:1:a) 'Liar - one that tells assertions of somethings known or believed by
the speaker to be
untrue with intent to deceive'
(4:1:b) 'Liar - one that tells untrue or inaccurate statements that may or may
not be believed true
by the speaker'
(4:2) 'Liar - one that tells somethings that mislead or deceive'
(4:3) 'Liar - one that tells charges of lying'
I think that regular readers will now concede that subsense (4:1:b) proves
that his many 'errors'
can be classified as lies, and (4:2) certainly fits Rush! But for the sake of
proof, I will now
document more than one lie, with complete disreguard as to whether Rush knew
they were lies at
the time he said them, to prove it by subsense (4:1:b).
These examples from FAIR (Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting). Please e-mail
FAIR (at
fair-report - it will be returned via e-mail) for the complete FAIR
report on Rush
Limbaugh, so you can see how Limbaugh responds to FAIR's reports of his lies
so-called response (that he lauded so loudly (at the time)) is included also,
as well as FAIR's
counter-response). LIMBAUGH: On California contractor C.C. Myers completing repairs 74 days early

out of the way." (TV

through the
rigmarole...of giving 25 percent of the job to a minority-owned business and
25 percent to a

REALITY: There was competitive bidding: Myers beat four other contractors for
the job.
Affirmative action rules applied: At least 40 percent of the subcontracts went
to minority or
women-owned firms. Far from getting out of the way, dozens of state employees
were on the job

Subj: It's Cupit, Ma'am, Not Stupid!
More from the "Liberal Media", from the 'Houston Press' June 20-26, 1996
these are pieces of -
The Insider - compiled by Tim Fleck
TALES OF CUPIT (RHYMES WITH STUPID)
The squirrelly adventures of Congressman Steve Stockman's frat-house band of
consultants who call themselves Political Won Stop seem to know no
limits. *The Hill*, a Congress-covering weekly in the nation's capital, first
revealed that Stockman's re-election campaign had paid more than
$126,000 to the consultancy, which is owned by 26-year-old Chris Cupit and
25-year old Jason Posey and is listed on the congressman's campaign
disclosures as having the same Whitman Way address as stockman's combination
home and election headquarters just outside Friendswood. More
recently, *The Hill* reproted that the address Political Won Stop used on its
DBA filing in Brazoria County is a rental beach house at Surfside.
Always up for a summer jaunt to the Gulf, The Insider motored down to Surfside
over the weekend to discover that the rent house, which is named
the Hide-a-Way and sits just down the road from the Money Pit, was vacent. On
our return, we talked to the owner of the Hide-a-Way, Houstonian
Diane Hensley, who rented the house in the off-season to Cupit from last fall
to early spring. Hensley, a Stockman supporter and unsuccessful
legislative candidate this year, says she's known Cupit for two years and
isn't surprised he listed the home as his place of business.
The Hide-a-Way certainly is an appropriately named location for a business run
by the secrecy-obsessed Cupit, the Stockman operative and GOP
nominee for Jefferson County tax collector-assessor whom we encountered on our
unannounced visit to Stockman's home/campaign office two weeks
ago. Cupit refused to identify himself and hid his face when a *Press*
photographer approached. It's apparently typical behavior from Cupit, judging
by the account of an advertising sales type who tried to sell the Stockman
campaign some bumper stickers two days before we ventured into the grip
of Stockmania.
The salesman says he contacted the Stockman headquarters "and got ahold of a
man who wouldn't identify himself except by his first name, Chris."
It took the salesman two weeks to get an appointment with the mysterious
Chris, and only under circumstances that seem lifted from a spy novel.
"He would not give me the address of his headquarters," recounts the salesman,
"and he asked if I would meet him on the parking lot of the Burger
King in Baybrook Mall." (Stockman's home/office is located in a subdivision
behind the mall.) When the salesman finally rendezvoused with "Chris,"
the Stockman flunky again refused to give his last name but expressed interest
in the batch of see-through, peel-off "Stockman for Congress"
stickers the salesman had brought along to demonstrate. Chris refused to allow
the salesman to put one of the stickers on his car and instead insisted
they be handed over for future inspection, presumably by the congressman. At
one point, Chris displayed a trace of envy by allowing that he wished
he could afford the see-through numbers for his own campaign.
The salesman is still chuckling over the encounter. "I'm in my early
seventies, and I've done business in Houston for over 35 years. It's the first
I ever made a sales pitch on the parking lot of a Burger King!" (He was later
shown a photo of Chris Cupit and positively identified the stealth
candidate as the phantom of the Burger King.) Their meeting was two weeks ago,
and now the salesman can't get through to Chris. "The guy who
answers the phone, who's a nitwit, says, 'What is this regarding?' Then he
says, 'I don't know if he's here.' I say, 'Come on, kid, you're in a house and
you don't know who comes through the front door?' "
Cupit also hasn't acquired much name identification in Beaumont, the seat of
the county where he wants to be the head tax collector. When The
Insider went on a Beaumont call-in show last week to debunk the false claims
by Stockman that we had assaulted his campaign workers and
terrorized his wife, the radio host, Jack Piper, was unfamiliar with Cupit and
his candidacy. During Piper's show, we played an audio tape of our
encounter with the Stockmanites at the congressman's home, wheich included our
repeated question, "Is Chris Cupit here?" Afterward, a
hard-of-hearing pro-Stockman caller rang up to chastise the liberal media for
"calling people stupid." Why, she asked, did we have to call them
stupid? Piper had to gently correct her: "It's Cupit, ma'am, not stupid."

The Stockman Welcome Mat
Having read the latest in your series of articles and "exposes" on Congressman
Steve Stockman, I have a few questions and observations for you:
Do you expect Stockman or his staff to welcome you into his home with open
arms when everything you've ever written about him has been decidedly
negative? Your stories and the tone of your paper are antything but objective.
You can't abide or report objectively on anything or anyone who is
Republican, nor can you ever report anything unfavorable on a Democrat.
You went to Stockman's place with your mind made up as to what you were going
to write. You refer to all his staffers as whiny. To me, you are the
ultimate whiner.

STOCKMAN MOURNS DEATH OF 'SUPPORTER'
Alan Bernstein, Politics
U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman of Friendswood did not immediately try to put a self-
serving political spin on last week's TWA jetliner tragedy.
He waited almost two days.
On Friday afternoon, reporters received a news release on Stockman's
congressional stationery. It expresses the congressman's deep sorrow that
Houston victim's rights advocate Pam Lychner was killed in the explosion and
crash off Long Island.
The document, an official communication from Stockman's publicly funded
operation in Washington, D.C., was headlined "STOCKMAN
SUPPORTER DIES IN TWA TRAGEDY/ VICTIMS' ADVOCATE MADE TV AD FOR STOCKMAN."
With direct quotes from Stockman, the news release lauded Lychner for her
criminal justice reform work.
"Pam was a friend who will be dearly missed by my wife Patti and I," said
Stockman's written words. "Pam Lychner did a campaign television ad for
me in 1992. I got to know her and her story. She was a woman of uncommon
courage and inner strength and that is how I will remember her."
Stockman's top aide, Cory Birenbaum, said the news release was not a political
exploitation of a grim event.
"We are just trying to point things out that affect" the congressman,
Birenbaum explained. "It's simply to regret the fact that a personal friend of
passed away."
To say the least, written statements from Stockman and Birenbaum have been
controversial lately.
In June, another official news release from Stockman carried the headline
"STOCKMAN STALKED BY TRESPASSING REPORTER."
It told Stockman's version of a visit to his home and campaign headquarters in
Friendswood by a reporter for the Houston Press, at a time when
Stockman was in Washington.
Stockman sought criminal charges against the reporter. The district attorney's
office refused to file the charges. The reporter then filed a libel suit
against Stockman.
Birenbaum was the focus of national publicity recently for a private letter he
wrote to a Texas Monthly reporter after the magazine ran an
unflattering profile of Stockman.
The letter said the writer got her magazine job "for reasons I would refuse to
speculate upon in polite society. Hope your knees have healed up
Birenbaum said he meant that the writer had to beg for employment, not that
she performed a sex act. ...

 See.. now.. you're clearly talking about power protection.. but, you see

Right.  That's why I pointed out that you shouldn't use a UPS and expect it to
prevent large surges (such as the type that occurs when lightning hits your

If you look up in your definition of the word "save", maybe, EXCEPT, there's
bound to be at least a couple of people on this list that don't need saving.
But really, what I'm here to save, is your computers -
Subj:  What if -
God and SuperMan got into a fight - no, I found this on a Rush newsgroup -
What if there was a Rush Limbaugh computer virus. What might it do? What about
some other political figures... ?
Ron Capik [aka: the NJ Editorial Minstrel ]
Forbes virus:       Makes all your programs give 17% of their resources back
to your system. We have no idea what the system will do with the resources.
(Only applies to earned resources.)  At a cost of millions (in un-earned
resources), the virus runs for a short time then quits.  Buchanan virus:     All your icons move to the far right of your screen.
Bill Clinton virus: Your pointer jumps back and forth across the middle of the
screen, seems to drift to the left and you can't seem to pick any programs. If
you have a sound card you may hear the sound of rushing [white] water.
Limbaugh virus [aka: ditto virus]:     All icons line up under the Rush icon
where ever it may go.
Bill Clinton      Icons turn purple and explode. (May be triggered by
conservative input)
Dole virus:         We don't quite know what it may do, but it seems to have
been in the system for a very long time. May cause system to enter sleep
Perot virus:        Ran for a short time in 92 then quit. It may also be
active for a short time in 96. May cause space alien problems with daughter
Hillary virus:      Causes text to appear on your screen years after you lost
it.  May trigger "Bill Clinton  virus.  May also cause rushing [white]
water sound.
What if, Stan had written those virus descriptions? - Buchanan virus [aka - "Sap" (of the 'Family (Values) Tree')]:     All your
icons move to the far right of your screen, and then, any icon that depicts a
face gets covered up by a white coned shape hat (and sheets, if the icon is of
a whole person).  The rest of the icons turn into pitch-forks, and swastikas.
The (now) covered 'people' icons then grab the 'pitch-fork' icons, and run off
the *extreme* right side of the screen.  The swastikas remain on your screen,
and cannot be removed, for they are burned into the phosphor.  Your computer
then logs on to America OnLine, goes to the 'government' forum, and then the
(now) covered 'people' icons return (in groups), with the 'pitch-fork' icons,
to the screen, and start attacking America (OnLine), starting with the
'government' (forum). The instant the Buchanan virus infects your computer, it
attempts to kill all forms of the 'Jerusalem' virus (but it never gets them
all).  Limbaugh virus [aka - "Whiner"]:     All icons line up under the Rush icon
wherever it may go.  As soon as 'Limbaugh' infects your computer, it (along
with any other virus that will join it) attempts to kill the 'Clinton' virus,
and the 'Hillary' virus (but doesn't succeed, only weakens them temporarally,
then they become much stronger, and impossible to remove for another '4 More
Years!').  Then it starts attacking any other viruses 'Limbaugh' thinks is
vulnurable, including the viruses that had joined it in attacking the
'Clinton' viruses.  The only viruses that the 'Limbaugh' virus has been know
to truly rid your system of, though, is the 'Limbaugh' virus, and the virus'
that believe that the 'Limbaugh' virus is a 'truth detector' type virus, or
that the 'Limbaugh' virus is on 'loan from god', etc.  The 'Limbaugh' virus
self-destructs after 7 or 8 years (and it can't understand why).  Gingrich [aka - "KingRich" (King of the Rich)]:     This virus affects
applications that have an ability to recreate previous commands given to that
application while editing a document of that application, using a 'history' or
'undo' command.  'KingRich' attaches itself to the 'history' files, and
selectivly changes certain portions in it.  So if you make a mistake, and you
need to go back and recreate your file before your mistake, you can still go
back, but you'll probably find the icons that represent your best work that
you had placed on the left side of your screen, now on the right of it, and
those icons that open your worst work, and previously placed on the right,
you'll now find that on the left.
Gingrich  [aka - "CryBaby"]:      This virus goes to the back of your pci,
vesa,16bit, or 8bit bus, and makes your hard drive make a real loud 'whining'
noise and your soundcard starts making a 'crying' sound through your audio
setup or speakers.  On your screen, 'CryBaby' places the message "I'm going to
shut the system down because I had to go to the back of the bus!", and it
causes your computer to go into 'default' (meaning, it causes you to lose your
CMOS memory, and it restarts with power-on 'defaults').
And we now know what the Dole virus will do -
Dole virus [aka - "Quitter"]:  This virus attacks your hard drive, causing it
to make a real loud 'whining' noise.  Then it quits, and you never have to
worry about it again.
