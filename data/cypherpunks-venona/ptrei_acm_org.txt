I called up Exon's press secretary and asked him about this. He claimed that BBS's were uploading advertisments to the Net, and this
was the 'profiteering' referred to. He was immune to reason on this,
and felt that the CMU 'study' was rigorous.
It's true that a some of the pics in those groups include stamped-in
BBS names and phone numbers, but my impression was always that this
was the BBS operators trying to do a little damage control - so that
when random users post their pix (on which they claim copyright, ignoring the fact that most of their scans rip off magazine publishers), they can recognize the 'piracy', and also earn a little

This is why it's imperative for cpunks to work on the SSL challenge
recently posted. Cracking 40 bit RC4 will provide a strong industry
incentive to move towards stronger crypto standards, and to pressure
the government to relax ITAR. If the SSL crack looks like it will take a while to gear up, perhaps
we should work on an interim project, cracking a straight 40bit rc4
encrypted message. If there is interest, I can create such a text, and escrow the key and plaintext in a PGP-encoded posting. While such a crack will not be as strong a blow against SSL and 40-bit crypto as cracking a complete SSL transaction, it will be
a lot better then only being able to say 'Well, we didn't find a
key, but we *did* sweep 40 bits of keyspace', which is all we have
now. If need be, we can follow up with a crack of full-bore SSL.
Disclaimer: I work on a competing product, but am posting this in my private capacity. We've bigger fish to fry than Netscape.

I started reading this thinking it was actually something important. All it describes is a keyboard monitor, which greps for CC and which could be spread by an (unspecified) virus, and sends the output to a crook over the net by some (unspecified) So, what else is new?
It's sort of interesting that "Nathaniel Borenstein" has a PGP key, but failed to clearsign this message, which loudly trumpets it's great import. Considering the

It's this last sig-quote that bothers me. It's worth noting that, unlike
the other two, it has no attribution. It looks like an inversion of Benjamin Franklin's: " They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety   deserve neither liberty nor safety."          - Historical Review of Pennsylvania
People usually put in their .sigs quotes they feel sum up their personal

"War is Peace"
"Ignorance is Strength"
"Freedom is Slavery"

@_subject: Re: USPS 
Back in June I attended a presentation on this from Paul Raines, who
is running the program. As I recall, there were three services they were
planning to offer. 1. A time-stamping service. This is basically a remailer - you would
send email to the USPS site, which would add a digital timestamp
and signature, then forward the message to it's ultimate recipient.
Customers wishing to use the service would deposit a sum of money
with the USPS, which would be debited for each use of the service
(suggested cost was on the order of 25 cents/message)
2. A CA service. Keys would be signed at various levels of assurance.
At least at the start, business strength keys would be issued only at
Postal Business centers, which are in about 100 cities in the US.
3. An archival service. For a fee, the USPS would store copies of all of
  the email you send though it's remailer. Only the sender could
  retrieve it, short of a court order. In answer to a direct question, Raines
  said that user-encrypted data was OK.
Raines claimed the following advantages:
* The contents would be subject to the postal fraud statutes. * People would trust a message received through the remailer more
  than one which was not.
* IRS tax filings sent through the Postal system can arrive after April
  15, provided they are postmarked before that time. Tax filings sent by
  other methods must be received at the IRS before midnight on the
  15th.
* Approximate quote: "When business negotiate a deal, they do it
  over the phone, in person, etc. But when the deal is closed, what do
  they do? They write a letter, and send it via registered mail through
  the USPS."
* As a CA, the USPS was a known and trusted entity overseas, unlike
  commercial CA services.
Some specific counter arguments:
Fraud protection:  If a person was intending to commit fraud, why would he or she send the message through the USPS remailer?
Since the service is costly, most email will never be sent through
it, and there will not develop a tendency to regard non-USPS email
as untrustworthy.
IRS filings: If I send a tax filing to the USPS remailer at 23:45 on
April 15th, it gets a pre-midnight timestamp and is accepted by the
IRS as being on time. If I send an email tax filing directly to the IRS
at 23:45, it is also accepted (and if I was that desparate, I could also
bounce the message through Hawaii, or US Samoa, and get several
more hours of grace) Also, I was under the impression that the IRS
now accepted FedEx timestamps for tax filings. Finally, the amount
of business which this represents is miniscule.
Closing deals: Ever hear of faxes or FedEx?
My personal impression was that Raines had been listening to his own propaganda for too long, and was rather out of touch with the way things are done outside of the Beltway. I got the feeling that the USPS was desperately trying to find a role in a time where it
was becoming merely the cheapest and slowest player in the package delivery business. Peter Trei

DES Key Recovery Project, Progress Report Friday, Jan 23 1997
Peter Trei
Next Tuesday morning, 9AM, RSA is scheduled to release the 'real' $10,000 DES challenge data. My software is in a state where it can be used for the
challenge, though there is room for improvement. It currently tests about 185,000 keys/sec on my 90MHz
machine. This translates to about 205,000 keys/sec on
a 100 MHz machine. I still have to replace my DES round,
which takes 25 clock cycles, with Svend Mikkelsen's, which
takes only 18. Since the DES rounds are well over 80% of
the work,  this should boost the speed to over 250,000 keys/sec at 100 MHz. If I'm lucky, I'll perform
this conversion over the weekend.
I've sent out early betas to a few people for porting,
but have had no feedback yet.
I've approached several restricted FTP sites as possible
distribution sites, and have had some positive responses,
but nothing definitive yet. I'm being pretty strict in
my interpretation of EAR for this purpose.
In advance of the challenge, I'm willing to email copies
as a ~100k uuencoded zip file to people, but to do so, you must
comply with the following:
1. Send the request to ptrei NOT trei
   I won't be able to read the latter for the next 10 days.
2. Include your 'true name' and residence address, as
   well as the email address to which it should be sent,
   .
3. A statement of your nationality. I'll mail it only
   to US Citizens, Canadian citizens, and US Green Card    holders, residing in the US or Canada.
4. A statement to the effect that you understand that this
   is restricted code, and that cannot be exported or    given to non-US/Canadian citizens
I'm going to hold this information in strict confidence, and
will surrender it only to a valid court order. It's similar
to what you have to go through to download the domestic
version of Netscape Navigator or PGP from MIT.
You are free to distribute the software further. If you've
complied with the requirements above, I believe that at that
point I've done more than due diligence under ITAR/EAR.
My software gets it's challenge data either from a text
file cut-and-pasted from the RSA page, or from internally
stored data. Tuesday night, I'll recompile the program with
the real challenge data, and redistribute.
My version runs on WinNT or Win95, on 486's and above. It's
set up as a console app, which can run in background. I don't
yet have a version for Win 3.1 or below 486, but may do in
the future.
The software is set up in such a way that it can be used
either on a standalone system, or in a LAN environment with
shared disks.  The latter has a slightly more complex setup, but will allow many machines to share one executable and
results file. I envisage people installing one copy on a shared disk in
their workplace, and then adding the appropriate commands
to the autoexec.bat file of every machine they can, so the program will start running whenever the machine is booted.
(I HOPE you get permission!).
The distribution includes both source and the Win32 executable.
The source includes both fast Intel assembler, and much slower
generic 'C'. There's nothing that's really Microsoft specific
in the code - it should be easy to port to other systems with
32 bit or better processors. I'm attempting to do a 'PGP style' distribution with a signed, nested zip file.
The signing key I'm using is available at
(I hope I've done this right).
I'm only going to send out signed archives. If you get one
where the signature fails, or one lacking a signature, I
repudiate it - and you should be suspicous of it.
I'll be trying to set up that URL as a page describing the
project, with info on other efforts, and FAQs. Once the challenge starts, I hope you'll all evangelize it
to your friends and acquaintences. I'd like to see 100,000
machines trying for the $10,000.
All next week I'm in the San Francisco area (I'm flying out in
a couple hours). I'll be attending the Verisign Partner's Day on
Monday, and I'll be at the RSA Data Security Conference Tuesday
through Friday. I'll be trying to read cypherpunks and coderpunks
at least once a day, along with checking mail to ptrei
I can't read cryptography from an archive, so I will not
see it unless it cc's ptrei (Perry, could you temporarily
