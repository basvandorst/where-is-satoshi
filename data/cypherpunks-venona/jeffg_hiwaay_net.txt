IMHO Microsoft has no concern about the security of any university; educational institutions will standardize on whatever OS the majority of their students are familiar with (=Windows whatever).  No, the big priority in Redmond is winning (and keeping) corporate customers.  A corporation can standardize around whatever the management likes.  A large Virginia-based metals corporation recently standardized on the M$ Office suite with little regard to the hundreds of users who had already effectively entrenched with WordPerfect.

Because I am treading in unfamiliar waters, I will just throw this one on
the table, leaving the discussion to the big boys.  Have you considered
sudo?  I really am not familiar with its capabilities, so easy with the
flames :^>

@_subject: Remote use=export? 
I apologize if this is a dead horse, but...
Is granting use of crypto software running in the US to a remote user
outside the US considered exportation?  For example, if allow my friend in
Paris to use a PGP binary residing and running on my PC in Washington, is
either of us violating any ITAR or similar restrictions?
