It is only surprising because you are a naive fool. The NSA will
stop at nothing to control us and you are just helping by allowing
yourself to be playing by their own rules and will set yourself up for
them to use as an example to the rest of us when they get your ass.
Don't be an idiot - wake up and LOOK. Read puzzle palace. We can't win
on there terms. They aren't playing fair and we shouldn't either.
