This is nothing new.  800, 900 and some other similiar numbers have been able to subscribe to a service called Automatic Number Identification (ANI) for many years now.  While it is related to Caller ID, it doesn't operate with necessarily the same restrictions/options.  Many companies use ANI in addition with special software to actually look at where you are calling from and either pull up your records, transfer you to a region specific extension, etc.
    I've heard rumors that some carriers pull their ANI information from CID thereby enabling you to block it just like you would the normal signal.  Other methods of remaining anonymous can be achieved by going through long distance companies that don't pass on ANI information or paying companies who offer you ANI blocking dial-throughs.

I thought this might be of interest due of the recent discussions about ANI and privacy.  I've seen this type of service before, but this one is apparently free (besides the cost of calling their area code if you aren't local).

It would still be possible for the LD company to just pass through your information for ANI, although I wonder what percentage actually do.

I'm not positive, but I think that there may be some standards on what types of signals and information that they must pass through.  I don't know that ANI signals would be among those, but I know that LD companies have been 'encouraged' for quite some time to pass on the information.

They would get your phone number and information on their bill regardless of whether they have ANI/CID/etc.  That comes from the phone company and not from their own systems.
    Not necessarily.  I get charged a flat 13 cents a minute for all connects to my 800 number, regardless of where they are calling from.

That and the fact that it can be physically sickening to the people who have to be around such individuals.
    The government can't do much about accidental bathtub deaths though.  Terrorism can be dealt with on a much more tangible level.
    I look at it this way.  Information warfare has the *potential* of being as potentially destructive as conventional warfare due to the very nature of our country's infrastructure.  However, when we look at other means of war that were supposed to be the "ultimate" force, like nuclear weapons, we've historically seen that they work better as pawns in the power struggle rather than as actual playing pieces.
    The main difference between nukes and infowar is that an attack by the latter means is more feasible for just about anyone as opposed to an actual country or powerful organization having nukes.
    Neither have I.  It would seem that the government has worked more towards actively discouraging any good infosec policies than helping out.  Let them take care of foreign nations amassing large groups of Internet connected work stations in their military bases and I think we can handle the infrequent malicious individual.

This is very similiar to the law (federal I believe) which states that you must report any 'computer crimes' to the authorities.  There are no punishments and it was obviously crafted to be more of a means of counting the crimes than solving them.  If anyone is interetes, I will get the specifics.

In related news...
Web Week, July 8, 1996, p3
    In an effort to do its part to nuture electronic commerce, the U.S. Postal Service is launching a pilot project this summer to test the electronic postmarking of documents sent over the Web.
    The electronic postmark--a time and dte stamp--will carry the full legal weight of the postmark on standard mail, including the Postal Service's authority to investigate tampering.
    The Postal Service's attorneys have told the USPS that the tampering part of the current federal law would transfer to the electronic space, and that the mail fraud portion might also apply...
    "We're a trusted third party," Saunders said.  "We don't have any interest in learning your trade secrets.  Congress oversees our actions.  Our customers have found that of value."
    Electronic postmarking is one of two services that the USPS intends to launch into cyberspace.  The second is a certificate-authority service, in which people can take a public encryption key and register it with the Postal Service for general use on the Internet.
    There will be three levels of security offered: simple online registration; a physical verification of identity; and the highest level, which requires electronic THUMBPRINTS.  The certification program will pilot-test in the fall and will be available to the public by the end of the year.  The price will be $10 to $15, Raines said.  The certificates will last one to three years, specified at registration.
    Cylink Corp,...is providing the public-key encryption and certificate-
issuing technology fo the Postal Service, basd on the company's patented Diffie-Hellman public-key cryptography scheme.  Neither the Postal Service nor Cylink executives would discuss the use of those technologies.
[Information about how their software will be integrated into software by Microsoft, Lotus and Netscape]
    The Postal Service plans to add follow-up services, including an electronic return-receipt program and time-specific delivery.

@_subject: Re: IP address 
I have never been able to cause more than a mild performance degredation by pinging a Windows 95 machine with large packets.  When testing the idea I kept increasing the packet size until the machine no longer responded, but the machine still had TCP/IP capabilities (in terms of transmitting data and forming connections).  Ping flooding is another matter though.  You probably could cause a larger performance drop.

A decent article about the subject (one that also gives us some historical proof of the govt's desires) can be found at:
    By the way, I'm finding all these articles on the page:

@_subject: Re: Deloitte-Touche? 
I was in attendance at an ISSA conference earlier this year where Mr. Murray gave the "keynote" speech on Electronic Commerce.  While he did strongly advocate the adoption of strong crypto and various methods of security, he never stepped into the more radical mode of encouraging people to break the law.  That was a different audience though.
    As he is also an ex-25 year IBM veteran it amazes me that he would make such a public outcry against govt. regulations (okay, so it's a stereotype).  Deloitte & Touche must really have a big stake in the pro-crypto market or else he actually cares a lot.
