@_subject: Surprisingly fast PGP5.5(i) scanning and proofreading 
Newsgroups: de.comp.security,alt.security.pgp,comp.security.pgp.discuss
I am probably not the only one surprised how "out of a sudden" the 5.5 version of PGP was scanned and proofread by Stale Schumacher
alone (as it seemed to me). Hence I asked him and Teun Nijssen (they, according to the README in
the PGPsdk 5.5 distribution on  did all the work) how
come they were so much faster and there wasn't a coordinated "distributed" proofreading as with the "international" version of PGP5.0.
Teun took the time for a detailed answer and was so kind to permit its
free distribution; so here is what he wrote in reply to my request:
The original reply was PGP-signed by Teun; it should be available via  from today, ~ 7pm UTC (GMT) on.
