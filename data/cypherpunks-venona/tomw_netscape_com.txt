The problem with that approach is that if the system is heavily loaded,
it can take an arbitrarily large amount of user time.  Somewhat better
is to sleep for a random amount of time after you're done.  That will
smear out the time distribution making it harder to get a statistically
meaningful number of samples.  It also increases your latency, but
doesn't hurt throughput on a busy system.

As Paul mentions in his extended abstract, there is actually an easy way
to fix the problem without hurting either latency or throughput much. If you blind and and unblind around the modular exponentiation, it
appears impossible to perform this attack.  Because you don't know the

based on those inputs.

Although your point is quite valid, there is always the possibility of
some technological advance that invalidates these calculations.  It is
possible that quantum crypto will some day make brute forcing 256 bit
keys practical.  (Of course, my knowledge about quantum crypto couldn't
fill a thimble, so maybe I'm wrong.)
These results also apply only to symmetric key ciphers and have no
relation to the difficulty of breaking RSA.  The techniques for
factoring large numbers have come a long way in the recent past and it
would not be much of a surprise for them to take another large leap.
All that being said, I believe that 128 bits is sufficient for a
symmetric key and 2048 for a public key.  Our paranoia would be far
better directed at as yet unknown attacks on the algoritms involved
or the specific implementations of cryptographic systems.  Paul Kocher's
recent timing attack is a perfect example of what we should be afraid

I'm just going to reply to what I think it the real substance of your
argument.  If I got the wrong piece, I'm sure you'll tell me.
This particular feature (the HTTP referer header) has nothing to do with
corporations "having their way" with users.  It was created so that web
authors could put "back" buttons on their pages.  The security problem
arises when stupid CGI authors use GET forms to transfer sensitive
information.  This is a security hole in the web site, not in the
browser.  The browser follows the HTTP specification.  If you have a
problem with that, contact the author of that specification.  Or, better
yet, contact the web site (as far as I know, there are none) that has
this security hole.
The only "bad guys" are the web sites that you are giving your private
information to.  If you trust them enough to give them your information
in the first place, shouldn't you trust them not to give it away by
using a GET form?
In the eyes of some, the referer header is a privacy violation.  It
allows a site to see what site you visited before coming there.  In the
case of Navigator, we ONLY send the referer header when you click on a
link.  Not when you select a bookmark.  Not when you type a URL into the
location field.  This allows web sites to see who links to them.  I
think that's something that a web author is entitled to know.
So, you think we're doing something bad.  Why don't you tell me what
you think we should do?

but I don't see any problem with that.
I fail to see the problem.  Right now, if you want to communicate
securely with exportable web browsers, this is the only way to do it. Either you do it, or you don't.  If VeriSign doesn't renew your cert,
then you're right back where you were the previous year.

It wouldn't help.  The problem is that your customers (using the export
client) who used to be able to connect using strong crypto now have to
use weak crypto.  It doesn't affect people using non-exportable clients.

Because issuing these certs is defined as a "defense service".

The main result of such a hack would probably be to get our export
license yanked.  Of course, you might see that as desirable, for either
its direct or indirect effects.

Princeton and the University of Washington are also doing some
interesting things, if you're interested in Java security.

There are a number of hardware vendors with PKCS modules for smart
and other hardware devices.  These include Litronic, Chrysalis-ITS and
You can import X.509 certificates and private keys.  The data format is
early version of PKCS which is actually more similar to MicroSoft's
PFX.  I believe the spec is available on our web site.  There are also a
number of other CAs on the web, including Thawte in South Africa.

For those of you interested, we are validated at level 2 when used on a
C2 OS, level 1 otherwise.  You can find more info at

Last I checked, NT was only C2 when networking was turned off.  Kind of
hard to use our products that way.  In particular, we were certified on
Solaris 2.4SE.

Don't hold your breath.  We're still bound by US export regulations, so
we won't be able to export crypto-relevant source code.  We'll release what
we can, but you probably won't be satisfied.
Of course, there's always the option for some enterprising individuals
outside the US to replace the missing pieces.

Actually, it wouldn't be any easier to deploy 56-bit RC4 than DES.  Either
would require roughly the same changes to both clients and servers.

I agree.  This is something that I found particularly offensive.  "Really,
