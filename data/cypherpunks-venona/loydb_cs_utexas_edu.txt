@_subject: Intro & Keystone 
First, as a newcomer, and introduction. My name is Loyd Blankenship. I am
the Product Development Manager at Steve Jackson Games, and was the
employee raided by the Secret Service that set off the formation of the
EFF, our lawsuit against them, and much angst within the government. I also
use the nome de' plume "The Mentor" when traversing the computer underground.
On to stuff relevant to the list:
A group of us here in Austin have spent a great deal of time discussing
the advantages of RSA-encrypted e-mail. I'm putting a BBS back up later
in the year, and would like to offer secure communications to my users.
Since the threat of seizure is very real (the feds still have over $10,000
(1989 street price) of computer equipment of mine since I'm "still under
investigation"), this needs to be implemented before the message is ever
written to hard disk.
To implement this, I'm currently trying to get PGP up on my Amiga, then
write the necessary C & AREXX functions to link it in with my BBS's (DLG
Pro) email function.
The outgrowth of this was the Keystone project. We're going to attempt to
get everyone in Austin cyberspace public-key capable, and get a master
keyring that will be regularly distributed via a trusted system to other
nodes in town. Ideally, you would be able to send RSA-encrypted email from
any bbs on any of the local nets to any other bbs -- even if all you know
is the destination address. We're going to do this by attempting to make
the bbs PGP-friendly. All the user has to do is generate a key pair.
The two potential weak links in this chain are line security and key
validation. The first is almost insurmountable -- unless the user takes the
time to d/l a complete copy of PGP and the Austin Keystone Keyring and
encrypt the mail on their home system. But if not, then they have to live
with the chance that someone is data-tapping. The second will rely on
face-to-face identification -- this is why we're making this a local effort.
It will probably be Christmas (when I have a 3-week vacation) before serious
strides are made in this, but I'm interested in any comments people may
p.s. What is this "game" you are talking about?

:I would be hesitant to implement a system that _only_ required a user
:to generate a key pair.  This, for the users, is too much provided
:privacy.  It will not teach the users how privacy really works, nor
:will it give them any good idea how their privacy is being maintained.
I take the opposite view -- I dare *not* supply such a system. Any user that
is interested enough in 100% privacy will be encouraged -- both from the
email prompt and through the message bases/file areas -- to d/l a copy of
PGP. I'll probably write a tutorial on using it as well.
But many users do not have the interest/time/ability to set up PGP on their
home system. For them, I want to provide the best possible privacy given the
ease with which anyone who can find their local LMOS can tap (voice or data)
a line...
:Defended privacy does not need to be difficult.  I would spend effort,
:instead of modifying BBS software, to make it easier for users to
:handle encrypted email with their own terminal programs.
I don't have my user's terminal program -- I *do* have the bbs software.
:Again, trusted systems can turn into provided privacy.  If there is a
:distributed solution you can think up, use it.
I don't know any way to maintain an up-to-date, central keyring without
someone being in charge of regular updates. I'd make it available via
Fido, FTP, BMS and regular d/l.

:But the user interface problem can be solved.	Just make a bunch of
:.com files which do nothing but spawn pgp by invoking the correct
:arguments.  Very simple; a few lines of C is all.  Even the PGPPATH
:can be set before the spawn.  It's an easy encapsulation.  It will run
:a bit slower for load time, but not appreciably.  And you won't have
:to recompile PGP from the distributed executables.
That's a real good idea. I shoulda thunk of it myself. :-)

:"How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what Steve
:Jackson Games did, what it was?" asked Sparks. "An hour?
:"Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to Steve
:Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything taken?
:"Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had a
:picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen --
:saying he was a computer crime suspect?
:"Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material could
:harm Steve Jackson economically?"
:Foley replied, "No, sir," but the judge offered his own answer.
:"You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go out
:and hire a lawyer and sue you."
This particular exchange makes me warm & tingly inside... :-)
:"Agent Foley, it's been almost three years. Has Chris Goggans been
:indicted? Has Loyd Blankenship been indicted? Has Loyd Blankenship's
:computer been returned to him?"
No, it hasn't.  Hopefully this will motivate them to return it. While
I can't get too excited about the then state-of-the-art 286 system, I'd
*really* like the laser printer back, and Whitney wants her papers returned.

This actually hits on one of my favorite rant topics. The feds like to
scream about how hard it is to tap a phone line with digital switching et
al, but don't talk about the fact that anyone with half a brain can tap a
line using the phone company's LMOS.
The only rational theory I've come up with to explain this is that the feds
aren't worried about court-ordered wiretaps, but about illegal wiretaps.
I bet there's a *lot* of monitoring going on out there that they can't get
a court order for, so they're doing it themselves. Monitoring without the
cooperation of the phone company will get harder when the company starts
paying more attention to security -- whether through encryption or simply
using a shredder. :-)

@_subject: Government Encryption 
Recently there was a thread on a public-key program that would involve a
central, government-backed-or-authorized agency to issue key pairs and
serve as a repository. Could someone please post some details on this --
I seem to have gotten it into my head that this is how PEM works, and I
don't know whether I'm right or just medicated. :-)
