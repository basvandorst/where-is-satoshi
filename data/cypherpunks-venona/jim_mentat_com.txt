I suspect not.  Re-exporting US crypto to Ireland without a license
doesn't make it.  Perhaps the fact that they're only using it within
their company would make it OK, but I'd check with the attorneys.
Very likely.  An American would want to be careful not to give any
Sekrit Data to the furriners, but perhaps the rules are different
for Canadians.
Easier yet, they can buy Canadian-grown strong Crypto from Entrust, for
example, and ship it both to their Irish and U.S. branches.  A guy from
Entrust told me last week that there was some consternation from Ft.
Meade when they first started shipping overseas this year, and after
they were shown the details and legalities they backed off.

Jim Choate skribis:
There's a very brief mention of a disk in "Masked Dispatches: Cryptograms
and Cryptology in American History, 1775-1900", available from the NSA
Central Security Service.  (Series 1, Pre-World War 1, Volume 1, United
States Cryptologic History), Center for Cryptologic History, by Ralph
E. Weber, 1993.
On page 110 he says: "The North, on the other hand, adopted a handy "on-line"
means of changing the basic flag code by prearrangement or at will, even within
the act of transmission.  This was done with a disk, in which the alphabet on
the inner disk revolved against an outer ring of flag combination, enabling an
instant change of code."
My impression from this and from the chapter summary is that the disk was
used for flag codes but not telegraphy.  For telegraphy the Union apparently
used a word-based route transposition that Friedman found unimpressive.
It's clearly different from the brass cipher disk used by the Confederates,
which used letters rather than flag positions as the ciphertext alphabet.
Weber doesn't include pictures of the disk.

IChudov relays from CNN Custom  News:
That reminds me... in PR Newswire on 16 Dec 1997 it was reported that
IBM had endorsed Meganet's VME, and recommended that NIST replace the
DES standard with it (presumably in the AES bake-off).  This was
humorous enough that I thought it worth sharing with IBM -- I
ingenously asked them whether it was true, and, if so, how they came to
the conclusion that it was a useful product.  They responded:
       I would like to apologize for the length of time it took
       to reply to your message. I had to make a few phonecalls
       and had to wait for someone to get back to me. I spoke with
       a Cryptography Specialist and she informed me that IBM
       has, in fact, not tested their product and therefore has not
       endorsed it. IBM has no further comment regarding the report.
       I hope this helps.

Randall Farmer skribis:
Doesn't seem terribly likely.  Typically ciphers will look strong until
someone discovers a chink.  The chink will sometimes lead to a serious
break, but not always, and not always quickly -- but at that point the
cipher looks weak.  Your best chance at encrypting stuff that needs a
long shelf life is with a cipher that's had a lot of analysis and
plenty of intrinsic key, like 3DES.
The former.  The S-boxes they replaced were bogus, and the ones they
came up with were good against differential cryptanalysis -- better
than random ones.  There's no a priori reason to believe they knew
about linear cryptanalysis, and in any case Matsui's l.c. attack on DES
is better than brute force only in situations where you have a great
deal of known or chosen plaintext.  So how come you claim they aren't
secure?  DES isn't suitable for long-archived info, but is still OK
for short-lifetime data against a not-too-motivated attacker: its
only known weakness for this application is its key-length, not its
I like it!

Tim May skribis:
Yes, that's definitely better for high-confidence long-term archival
stuff than relying on one cipher.  Carl Ellison's suggestion was DES |
tran | nDES | tran | DES, where "tran" is an unkeyed large-block
One word of caution (which should be obvious, but can't hurt to repeat it):
if you chain ciphers (e.g. DES | IDEA | 3DES | CAST | Blowfish), be sure to
use separate keys for each of them; otherwise breaking the last one will give
the key to the whole lot.
BTW, I went to look this up in the Cyphernomicon (I sorta think it's

@_subject: Re: Chaining ciphers 
Matthew Ghio rispondis:
If the person strapping those systems together writes them from scratch
and the penultimate cipher gives a flat distribution, then I agree
100%.  However, many (most?) standalone encryption programs will put a
magic number or other identification at the beginning (e.g. encrypted
PKZIP) or will do a sanity check that actually tells you whether you've
decrypted with the right key, whether you see garbage or not (e.g.
EAY's stand-alone 'idea', 'des', etc.).  PGP also has distinctive headers,
I think.
In the world of existing cipher packages it's usually possible to tell what
you've got.  Assume Kerckhoff's principle, of course: the attacker knows
which packages you're using and which order you're doing them in.

Guy skribis:
I don't know how elegant it is, but here's my response:
Compromising the public's right to privacy gives away not only our own
rights, but those of our descendants.  The government must make an
extraordinary case to justify undermining those rights, and so far it
has not done so.
The most detailed research on the issue is a study by Dorothy Denning
and William Baugh investigating the extent to which crypto has
interfered with law enforcement's ability to get convictions: their
bottom line was that crypto has not in fact interfered: law enforcement
has been able to complete their investigations using other means.
There's no demonstrated need for Government Access to Crypto Keys
(GACK), so there's no need to compromise away our privacy.

Stan the Sequencer sez:
This isn't quite accurate.  The term "spamming" in Mudding has always meant
inundating the players with repetitive material, whether intentionally
or accidentally, and has been used in that sense since sometime around
1990 at least.  The "overflow" is of user screens, not stacks or
buffers... although of course any high usage like that can test a
program's limits.
I just wrote and snipped a long disquisition on the history of spam starting
with Clarence Thomas IV in 1993, having realized it's probably not relevant to
your interests and old hat to everybody else.  Suffice it to say that spam
does require extra resources to process, both in hardware and time.  We resent
it because the end user is paying for it rather than the advertiser, so there
is no natural limit to the amount of crap they can pour on us.

[Bill Payne's's mailing list pruned back to cypherpunks only]
Is that to speed it up, so you don't have to initialize it by spinning
through a bunch of initial iterations?  Turns out there's a time-memory
tradeoff, where if you do a recursion relationship on where you want it
to start, you can set it up in log2 time and come out with the same
starting point you would have by spinning: the recursion equations
cancel nicely and it boils down to something manageable.  I think other
people have initialized it with another PRNG with good success.
I  that's not classified, since I came up with the recursion
shortly after the Lewis & Payne paper on GFSR came out -- JACM, wasn't
it?  I never got around to writing it up.

@_subject: Re: text analysis 
The term is "linked list".  If you want to collect all the arbitrarily
long repeats you may have to resign yourself to a two-pass algorithm.
For small cryptograms like the ones I usually deal with, it's
sufficient to use an N^2 algorithm, looking at each starting point and
each possible offset to see whether a string of at least k characters
is duplicated at that offset.  For a longer file, off the top of my
head, you might start with a set of pointers for where each possible
digraph starts; you can use a linked list, storing all the starting
locations for each digraph (a two-dimensional array of pointers, total
size 64K).  On your second pass you can do an N^2 search within those
reduced sets to see which repeated digraphs can be extended.  It will
help a lot if your target ciphertext fits in memory.  I make no claim
that this is optimal.
