@_author: and any other country for that matter 
@_subject: Re: money maker 
Count me in.  I can take information from the U.S. and Canada and send to the Bahamas and Switzerland (and any other country for that matter).  Additionally, I believe I have a fairly safe way to route messages.  The only problem is this: would the lag between mailing the email and the financial transaction going through diminish the return on the investment?  Perhaps that is something to consider.
