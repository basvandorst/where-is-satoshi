The mail server has identified an administrative command in your
message. DO NOT SEND ADMINISTRATIVE COMMANDS TO THE LIST. All server
commands should be sent to listproc
If you did not intend to send an administrative command, then you'll need
to rewrite your message to avoid the command words
that are causing listproc to trap your message.
For help, send email to address info
