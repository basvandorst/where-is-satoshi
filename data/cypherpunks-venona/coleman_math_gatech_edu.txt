The group of 7 in question are definitely not `wannabes'.  They are
about as knowledgeable a group as you could find outside of the NSA.
The report discussed the length of key needed for *symmetric*
crytosystems.  As this pertains to PGP, it uses a 128 bit session key
for the IDEA symmetric algorithm.  Not 2048.
Their recommendation was for a *minimum* of 90 bit keys for data
that must remain private for any length of time.  Given the calculations
they stated, this seems reasonable.

I'm way out of my league here, but using a small OTP to create a
larger OTP seems impossible on information theoretic grounds.

I've always wondered why large companies just don't write some type of
standards document for crypto to interoperate, and then have each
foreign branch write (or contract out) their own version.  I don't see how
this violates export laws in any way.
Surely this has to be easier than some of the contortions large companies
are going through now to safeguard communications between branchs in
different countries.
