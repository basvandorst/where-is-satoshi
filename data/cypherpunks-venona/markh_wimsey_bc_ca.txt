} As I understand RIPEM there is a tree of agencies such that everyone

I just want to point out (as has been pointed out before) that it is a mistake to confuse RIPEM with PEM. RIPEM is an implementation of a subset of PEM. At this moment, RIPEM has
absolutely no support for certificates or signed public keys.
PEM on the other hand, is a draft internet standard which requires
certificates and a hierarchy that can be described as a "Tree of Trust".
There are at least a couple of full PEM implementations. Probably
the best known at this point is the one from T.I.S. which is currently

You should be able to do it. But, you will first have to get permission
from RSADSI to access RSAREF in ways other than by the published interface. I trust they'll grant it, given what you say above.
Also, be sure to get the RSAREF version included with RIPEM (wait for
version 1.07 if you can). It has several significant performance enhancements (generic and some platform specific asm versions of
time critical code).
You won't be able to export this 'legal' version of PGP. Tracking

@_subject: Re:  Tough Choices: PGP vs. RSA Data Security 
With respect to this, putting another symmetric cipher into RSAREF is a simple matter. I've done it for triple DES (3 key EEE version). Once
(and if) we get permission from RSADSI to distribute it, it will go
into the RIPEM distribution. I don't see any reason why we couldn't
plug in IDEA. If you look at the RSAREF code you'll see that it would
be technically very easy.
Problems with RSAREF/RIPEM:
1. Use of RSAREF/RIPEM in support of a commercial enterprise is prohibited without paying a licence fee. Note that they can get you on copyright violations rather than patent infringement if you break the RSAREF licence agreement. My bet is that it makes enforcement a much simpler matter (you might say, especially in Canada).
Note that personal use on a commercial system is OK.
2. One needs to get permission every time one wants to modify RSAREF in
any substantial way. 3. The pseudo random number generation is suspect, especially if we're considering using symmetric cipher keys of > 64 bits. Essentially at most 2^128 distinct sequences of pseudo random numbers can be generated. 2^128 is a big number, but on the other hand it does make one wonder whether
it is worth adding a scheme which uses 192-24 bits of key material.
It isn't that I know how to break it, but on the other hand, it wouldn't
surprise me if someone could compute, in less time than it would take
to try 2^128 possibilities by brute force, some smaller number of possibilities for the encryption key given the IV which is output in plaintext in a RIPEM message. Call me paranoid.
4. We need something better than 56 bit key DES (said it before).
5. export problems.
6. RIPEM currently has no way to handle certificates or sign other people's
public keys. This is, of course, serious.
Good things:
1. One can use it for non-commercial purposes in North America.
2. Performance of RIPEM is considerably better than the original RSAREF
code. The DES routines have been replaced. Furthermore a lot of platform
specific improvements have been made to the large integer operations.
The point being, that performance is similar to PGP.
3. The promise of PEM compatibility. (People are working on getting
some support for certifificates into RIPEM.)
The real point is that if we put our considerable resources behind something
like RIPEM or 'legal' PGP and we had RSADSI's cooperation in terms of permission to modify, improve and update RSAREF then we could almost
certainly have a high quality legal personal public key encryption program
with the features we want, in a few months.
It is a compromise. PGP is already done and is a very impressive
software package. It certainly has a better feature set than RIPEM.
It has been exported, so the export control issue is not a serious one.
I do think the optimal solution (for both RSADSI and us) is to get some sort of scheme into place where PGP could be used legally for a licence fee (either per key or per person). Perhaps the folks at RSADSI could
sign keys as PAID (but not necessarily authenticated) for US$50. They
would certainly make some money in the process.

if you can find an one of these old versions lying around on a ftp site,
you are free to do with it as you like (anything I wrote is in the public

This does bring up an interesting ethical question.
What should one do when one discovers that a vendor is marketing
an encryption scheme for the protection or to limit the use of
specific information, which is easy to break.
Obviously, one is neither doing the vendor nor the customers of that
vendor a favour by posting a detailed account of the weakness of
the system.
One the other hand, if one justs sits on the information, it is clear that other people will be able to deduce the weakness in the system and actually use it to steal information; and why not, I suppose anyone who puts trust in "smoke and mirrors security" probably deserves exactly what they get. The world abounds with weak encryption algorithms which are being used to protect information of consderable value. The case with Verilog, and their use of an easily "crackable" scheme is far from unique. Still I don't have an answer. Say one discovers that a vendor is protecting its customers' information using a simple "crackable" linear encryption function. Is that information something to reveal, something to keep secret or what? If one were to approach the
vendor in question with that kind of information, I can imagine
all sorts of legal entanglements that might arise. There are other instances which are similar. Information on the
(in)security of various operating systems comes to mind.

Luks did the trivalent case and then later the bounded valence case. bounded genus is due to Miller. Also bounded eigenvalue multiplicity due to Babai and others.
There are also a number of related problems which are believed to be difficult. Finding a small generating set for the automorphism group of a graph is
polynomial time equivalent. The graph isomorphism problem also reduces
to several of computational problems in permutation groups where these
groups are given by small generating sets (e.g. calculation of the centraliser
of a permutation, group intersection, double coset membership, subset
stabiliser, normaliser)
This is one of those problems where the "average" case is relatively easy. Take a random graph (with a reasonable definition), finding the automorphism group is usually relatively easy by backtracking. The hard cases are ones which superficially look like they have lots of symmetry but really have small non-trivial automorphism groups. Similarly for graph isomorphism, i.e. take two random graphs (again one needs to define this), it is usually pretty easy to determine whether they are isomorphic (just look at the degree sequence and work from there). Approaches involving backtracking to find isomorphisms can be effective in more subtle cases. So you need to be careful to avoid the easy cases. I remember some really hard (practically) cases for the usual backtracking approaches to determining automorphism groups came from graphs derived from certain designs. I'd sure like to see more details about a public key system based
on Graph Isomorphism. (For a book on graph isomorphism and related computational problems take a look at C.M. Hoffmann, Group-Theoretic
Algorithms and Graph Isomorphism, Lecture Notes in Computer Science
 Springer-Verlag, 1982. A little old but it covers a fair bit).

HP 9000/730 and was miserable on anything else I tried (Sparc, 80486,
MIPS R3000, 68030).
There's a really nice survey paper by Cetin Kaya Koc (then of RSADSI) called _High Speed RSA Implementation_ which describes various optimisations. The references in this are also pretty useful.

@_subject: Re: Canadian Cypherpunks [NOISE] 
I don't think it is any more practical to have "Canadian Cypherpunks"
meetings than "U.S. Cypherpunks" meetings. Call them what they are, i.e.
regional meetings, (e.g. areas around Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver,
Quebec, Calgary-Edmonton, etc.), but I suspect that most people are
unlikely to travel in excess of 3000km for meetings which last a few
hours. For example, I expect that Vancouverites are much more likely to
travel to Seattle for a meeting than to Toronto.
My point is, don't advertise what is really a Southern Ontario regional
meeting as the meeting of "Canadian Cypherpunks". This would be like
calling the S.F. Bay Area meetings the "U.S. Cypherpunks meetings".

@_subject: Wimsey cryptography archive is moving to Mindlink 
The Wimsey cryptography archive at ftp://ftp.wimsey.com/pub/crypto is moving
to MIND LINK ( You can now access the contents of the cryptography archive at its new location
The archive has been at Wimsey for about five years. I'd like to thank
the folks at Wimsey for providing disk space, bandwidth, technical
expertise, and for supporting the distribution of ~140MB of cryptography papers and software on the Internet.
As with Wimsey, MIND LINK is providing disk space and bandwidth for the archive at no charge to me or the users of the archive.
Thanks should go to MIND LINK for providing this as a service to
the Internet community.
Two small notes:
1. I assume sole responsibility for the contents of the archive. The
   folks at MIND LINK are generously providing facilties at no charge
   above their usual access fees, but they are not necessarily even    aware of the exact contents of the archive. My only connection with    MIND LINK is as a customer. 2. Please do not attempt to use the MIND LINK crypto archive to violate
   the laws of the U.S. or Canada. Distribution of cryptographic software
   is limited to U.S./Canadian persons in the U.S./Canada. All access to    the site is logged.
