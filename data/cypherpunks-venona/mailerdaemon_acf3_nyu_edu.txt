I agree.
Re: low tech - The extropians uses several Perry(TM) filters
to prevent unwanted bounces AND unwanted posters OUT.
For a more high tech solution I can imagine some sort of public or
private key needed to make a post - An example being some a public key that was in some manner signed by a trusted member of a list - I am weak on the techincal
end/side but basically unless the message is "trusted" it doens't
get through.
