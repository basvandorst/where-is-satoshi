I don't know if a simple reply gets to the cpunks list, but here goes.  There
have been two convictions for exporting crypto.  They were Elizabeth Martinez
and Mario Vallodares, in Miami, in Judge Hoeveller's district court (same
judge who tried Noriega).
The police work was done by Customs.  The NSA does not have a police, apparently.  The NSA attended the trial and took copious notes.
Elizabeth and Mario exported TV satellite receivers to Latin America.  These
receivers, made by General Instruments, contain the DES programmed in EPROM,
the whole potted in epoxy.  They were charged with violation of ITAR because of the crypto.  A bunch
of counts.  All their receivers were seized.  They were also charged with
conspiracy because they had attended trade shows in Las Vegas where
exporting the receivers were the subject of sessions.
Mario served one year and one day in Federal prison.  Elizabeth served
six months in a workhouse.
David Kahn, Cipher Deavors, and George Davida were expert witnesses for
the defense.  It was to no avail.

Forwarded message:
A little skepticism is in order.  The story reeks of PR, most likely by
Israeli counter-intelligence.  It appears to threaten (in a nice way)
the civilian leadership. I would suspect the facts as being inflated, the private eyes a convenient
cover for the desired message.
I read it as some sort of blackmail by Israeli secret police.

Forwarded message:
Yes, I found it distorted.  My question for John Markoff, if he would be
kind enough to answer, is:  is "traditional" his word, or was it his
source's?  If source's, was source DoJ, or White House?
IMO, police wiretapping usurped a power forbidden to it by the Fourth.  To
call usurped power "traditional" is pretty smarmy.

I'm waiting for Sternweiler to denounce Clipper for patent violations,
wince we know this was his only objection to PGP.

Forwarded message:
Well, as I read that sentence in isolation, it is true, and a Good Thing.
I will be concerned if the author is urging "institutional" supervision.
Guess I gotta go read the New Yorker now.  Sheesh, you guys, you get me
to read the Atlantic Monthly, now the New Yorker.  I hope they have gotten away from their dilatory style, and that the cartoons are still
good, if I gotta waste my money this way.

@_subject: Re: Sternlight & PGP 
I would like clarification on Sternlight's contention that PGP violates
RSA's patents.  My understanding is that PGP < 2.4 does not so long as
its use was private and non-commercial.  In other words, isn't the patent issue a fabrication of Sternlight to
attack PGP?
Or did he really have a point?

Forwarded message:
I have a hack in C for the PC that does trigraphic counting a la Sinkov.
It is just a hack, without documentation, and limited to a file that
is smaller than a 80x86 segment.  But if there is interest in it, I
can make it available.
Trigraphic counting, BTW, is the way to go.  Helps reveal repeated
sequences.  The same counting gives you your more normal stats too.

Forwarded message:
Well, yes, IBM did create DES.  But the NSA against its better judgment
blessed the effort, and by my guessing helped tremendously.  I have heard
rumors that NSA *does* say it was their biggest mistake, and never again.
There is no way I can prove a rumor, but I put a lot of credence in these
particular rumors.  I speculate that it was Bobby Inman who ordered NSA
to facilitate IBM.

If you have time, why not ask the NYT and LAT for permission.  I'll bet that
they will be glad to grant it, but it will take a few weeks.
