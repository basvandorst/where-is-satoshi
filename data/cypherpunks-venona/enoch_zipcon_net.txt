A few comments... Almost every non-trivial program which runs on a platform which does not
shield the OS from applications can be subverted to give access to the
target machine. This is hardly news.  The fact that a determined Dane with a debugger
managed to poke through the code and break something is neither
earth-shattering nor remarkable. In something the size of Netscape, I'm sure 999,999 exploits still remain. The company is hardly going to start writing checks every time someone
finds one of them.
Until all application software runs on secure virtual machines, or passes
bytecode verification and formal proofs of correctness, this problem will
continue to exist, not only in Netscape, but in every other large
application as well.

This is of course an interesting suggestion, since most underage
erotica and gambling on the Net aren't encrypted in the first
place.  It reminds me of one Islamic country where the leaders
introduced television by reading the Koran over it, daring
critics to attack something that could be used to transmit the
word of God.
We have much the opposite situation here in the United States,
where any new technology is immediately judged by whether it can
be used to transmit pictures of naked children, or thwart
attempts by law enforcement to stamp them out.

Perhaps by "Child Pornographers," the good Senator means those
legally producing erotica in countries where the permissible age
is 16 or 17, as opposed to the US-Mandated Official Age of
Adulthood and Full Responsibility(tm) of 18.
Countries where, of course, would-be child pornographers use only
quality American encryption, the population of such nations being
so busy pornographing that they have no time to develop strong
encryption products of their own.

After you defeat that one, you will discover that the text of the

This is a problem which I have been pondering in recent days. How
would someone in the future demonstrate that they have broken
DES, now that the RSA DES Challenge is behind us, and trusted
parties offering to generate and keep secret ciphertext/plaintext
pairs are no where to be found.
It would seem to me that the best way to demonstrate that one has
broken a block cipher without releasing ones algorithm would be
to generate and publish some key collisions, in which a
ciphertext/plaintext pair is mapped by more than one key.
If one encrypts plaintext with a known key to generate
ciphertext, cryptanalysis of the resulting ciphertext/plaintext
pair for a key other than the one used to generate it should be
comparable in difficulty to cryptanalysis of a
ciphertext/plaintext pair provided by a trusted third party.
The ability to generate such collisions at will clearly
demonstrates that one can calculate keys from
ciphertext/plaintext pairs.

A step in the right direction.  We should develop ways of
demonstrating cryptanalysis which do not require one person to
solve a problem provided by another person without the

If there were to be no solutions at all, given the alleged

The Supremes can easily dismiss the Constitution any time they
like by using the magic phrase "Society's Overwhelming Interest."
We saw a good example of that today, in a ruling which said that
Society's Overwhelming Interest in protecting its citizen(-unit)s
outweighed the right of specific terminally ill citizen(-unit)s
to smoke marijuana to relieve intractable pain.
Even the First Ammendment falls victim to this phrase when the
Supremes rule that Society's Overwhelming Interest in protecting
its children makes it possible to commit a felony using only a
Playboy, a Jack and Jill, scissors, and a piece of scotch tape.
Similar arguments come out of the Court all the time about
Society's Overwhelming Interest in "preserving the family,"
"protecting children," "empowering parents," "thwarting
terrorists", and generally preserving the right of the state to
rule, to execute, to collect taxes, and to rip out the spleen of
anyone who publicly objects.

The self-proclaimed "child protectors" are at it again.  This
time, an ex-police officer with far too much time on his hands
has declared war on all so-called "boylover" web sites on the
This includes not only sites where legal issues surrounding
youthful sexuality are discussed, but virtually every site in
which the word "boy" appears, including photography web sites,
young celebrity sites, and any sites such sites link to.
We're not talking about porn here, but material which is
perfectly legal, the vast majority of which would attract little
attention aside from the fact that a bunch of Christian wankers
have unilaterally decided for all of us that they do not want it
on the Net.
They have sworn to harrass each and every ISP carrying material
on their "hit list," until the material is removed.  Tactics
include intimidating snail mail spams and phone calls by people
claiming to be associated with law enforcement, as well as late
night phone calls threatening bodily harm to ISP management and
their families.
The rantings of this individual and his similarly minded friends
can be found at...
         and      The latest organization to be attacked by Officer Friendly and
his contingent of jackbooted thugs is XtatiX.com, a small
provider which until recently had hosted a number of web
resources which CPAC didn't like.  The nature and content of
these web sites were clearly discussed with XtatiX before they
were chosen to host them, and assurances were given that no problem existed. XtatiX.com states explicitly on their home page, and I quote...
   "XtatiX supports the concept of an open Internet. Xtatix
    does not censor accounts or content in any form. We
    encourage our users to exercise sound and responsible
    judgement when creating their web pages."
   "We also understand that some internet sites may have
    content that some find objectionable. Software products
    exist which give the individual the ability to limit
    unwanted material. This software does not interfere with the
    rights of others to surf as they wish."
So one might think that anything legal and resonably tasteful
goes at XtatiX, right?  Well, that's the way it was until the
CPAC contingent hurled a few threats in their direction.
In response to the harrassment, XtatiX is now sending a letter to
web customers whose pages are, according to XtatiX, "too
XtatiX says in part...
   "We regret to inform you that we can no longer host your
    website, due to many local and national pressures on us, to
    get rid" of sites of the nature of yours, and also a few
    more sites with other natures that could be considered
    controversial."
   "We sincerely apologize, because we _DO NOT_ like
    censorship, nor do we endorse its use. We have had to
    practice it of late, though, because of many law
    enforcement and other officials emailing us, and or calling
    us in regards to some of the sites we are now hosting."
   "Again, if it were based soley upon our choice, then we
    would not change our censorship policies, and would not have
    to do things such as these, which pain us very much. We
    would appreciate it very much if you would please copy the
    files you need to host your site off the server within 48
    hours, and delete the copies on the server."
   "This does not mean that we do not still want you on as an
    XtatiX customer, but we can no longer deal with as many
    hate mails, phone calls, and emails from law enforcement
    officials and users on other systems. Please bear with us."
Now XtatiX is certainly welcome to accept or turn away business
as they see fit, although it seems somewhat disingenuous of them
to loudly advertise their service as one that "does not censor
accounts or content in any form," while at the same time,
crawling all over themselves to get rid of customers they
consider "too controversial," based on harrassment orchestrated
by a single pressure group.
Now to some Cypherpunk issues this case illustrates...
"Information Wants To Be Free"
Our working model of information services has always been
comprised of three things.
First, a dynamic collection of information service providers with
complete discretion as to whom they choose to do business with.
Second, a Net which regards censorship as damage and routes
around it.  And third, market forces that ensure that any legal
information has a home where others may access it.  Providers
that censor lose customers, who give their money to providers who
The CPAC/XtatiX case study demonstrates another reality.
First, a dynamic collection of information service providers in a
mad race to see who can come in second to last when the awards
for "Enemy of the State" are handed out.  Second, a Net in which
almost nothing is multi-homed which cannot even regard damage as
damage and route around it.  And third, market forces which
ensure that censorship is frequent, silent, and never publicly
spoken of in policy statements.
Whether it's CPAC wanting to nuke all web sites containing the
word "boy," Sen. Swinestein wanting to nuke all web sites
containing the word "bomb," or Sen. Hatch wanting to nuke all web
sites containing the word "sex," the optimal strategy for service
providers has turned out to be to quietly remove any material
some squeeky wheel is uncomfortable with, keep proclaiming
themselves to be the strongest supporters of free speech in the
entire Net community, and stonewall when asked questions which
might suggest anything to the contrary.
This behavior of the Net mirrors the behavior of the other
so-called "free" market-driven media.  There are issues and
points of view you will never see discussed on the evening news,
or in Time and Newsweek.  There are books that disappear from
your local library and bookstores and are not replaced.
The Net is starting to look a lot more like just another
"self-regulated" media outlet, where the individual citizen has
access only through a company whose principals are well versed in
whose feathers must not be ruffled.
The CPAC/XtatiX dance is being repeated each and every day, with
providers like Tripod and Geocities, and with search engines
quietly removing Horsemen-related articles from their databases,
all while proudly displaying their Blue Ribbon Campaign icons for
Free Speech on the Net.
What's happening now is that a lot of sites are moving offshore,
but it probably won't be long before "The Attorney General's List
of Horseman-Related Offshore IPs" is dutifully prepared for
Congress each year, and Router-Blocked at our borders under
threat of criminal penalties.  "Information Laundering" will
undoubtedly become the Fifth Horseman shortly thereafter.
All of this represents a big shoe in the clockwork of
Crypto-Anarchy, and a problem needing a technological solution

I read your earlier post, and find the notion of hosting Web
sites on Usenet intriguing.  Tim has always pointed out that
Usenet already exists as a persistent uncensorable repository of
virtually everything, and that applications (eg BlackNet) needing
such a facility should simply use the existing one.

Conceptually, seamlessly extending the Web over Usenet is not
complicated.  Each document could be posted as a single PGP
conventionally encrypted article, with some reasonable convention
for encryption keys and message ids that would enable links to be
followed. Browsers could be modified to maintain a open
connection to an NNTP server, and to fetch and decrypt articles
specified by an nntp: link in lieu of using http.
Suppose I post my favorite banned Web pages to
alt.anonymous.messages on a weekly basis, and distribute browser
plug-ins and patches to enable Usenet to host Web content.
I forsee the following glitches.
First, as anyone who has posted a large number of articles to
Usenet knows, many servers will only get a subset of them.
Second, policy for article expiration is site-specific, and can
be made to depend on a number of parameters.  Posting once a week
may be fine for some servers, and not for others.
Third, it is only practical to employ Usenet to host static Web
content.  This rules out Web-based chat boards, and other such
politically interesting content, as well as anything that is
cgi-bin based.
Fourth, Web content on Usenet will be in an easily identified
format and trivial to filter out at local sites.

-----Begin Officer Paladino Rant-----
July 29, 1997, I was told of an article that appeared on the Net.
It appeared on a Netly News site. Of course, its good reading if
you are a Boylover. Apparently the writer, like many reporters I
have known, likes to keep the pot stirring with coin phrases like
war, net.vigilantes and so on.
To give the article credibility he interviewed CPAC, NAMBLA,
ACLU. He also mention this writer but forgot to get a statement
from me and 100's of other groups that feel that child porn,
molesters and such have no place on the web.
In the article he links to a few sites showing young boys but he
forgot to link to the 1000's of sites showing young boys in the
nude. Why is that I ask. Well to keep the pot stirring. He claims
their is gay bashing going on, look on this site and others that
link here and you'll find no gay bashing.
You will see sites exposing young boys, as young as 4 years old,
nude. I, for one, can't not justify nude pictures of 4yr old boys
and girls. But the Boylovers insist this is their way of showing
love. AND, of course, we always get back to the Freedom of Speech
You know that gigantic excuse for expression. We still have
Freedom of Speech in this counrty, while every other liberty is
falling by the wayside. As I read the article, I could see the
bias and I wonder why???? Maybe the reporter also has an agenda.
If he writes another article on this subject, it would be
interesting to see which Boylovers will be interviewed.

I am pleased to announce that I have successfully installed Adam Back's
"Eternity Server" on my home page.  This server permits a user to
transparently browse Web content posted to Usenet in encrypted form in
newsgroups like alt.anonymous.messages. Eventually, the Eternity Server will also serve web content from a variety
of more permanent repositories, like Altavista and Dejanews.
The Eternity Webspace is comprised of http URLs in a new virtual top level
domain, .eternity.  All documents are PGP signed, and posters may
optionally choose to have their domains indexed in a top level directory
under the URL  PGP is used for encryption, and documents may require the user to supply a
password before they can be viewed.  Documents may also be encrypted
with the hash of the URL, so that documents are only accessible to
individuals who already know their names. Although I expect most people will want to install their own servers in their Unix shell accounts, I will leave my server open for a little while
so that people can play before installing the software.
To try it out, just select the "Eternity Server" link on my homepage
             In order that people have something to browse, I have seeded
alt.anonymous.messages with two virtual web sites.  The first of these has a URL of  and is a single
document describing different ways one might kill a certain purple
dinosaur.  The second has a URL of  and is a large index
of boy-related resources on the Web, recently made homeless by the
CPAC/Sewer people.  The authors have devoted their best efforts to make
sure this list contains no links to porn or illegal material.  The latest version of the eternity server may be found at Adam Back's
Web site and is called eternity-0.04.tgz.  You will need Perl 5 and
access to cgi-bin to install it. The eternity home page is...
          Included are the eternity server, written in perl, and a "sitegrabber,"
which can be used to post entire websites to Usenet.

We already have a preconfigured set of exit remailers.  They have
names like "hotmail", "rocketmail", etc...  These are the
web-based email services which will instantly create accounts for
anyone, no questions asked or authentication required, and permit
access to these accounts with the chosen password from anywhere
on the Net.  You can even chain them, using an account on one to
apply for an instant account on another, leaving few bread crumbs
for anyone to follow.
Most of these services don't care, don't log, and rarely read
their email to abuse Even if pressure does cause an occasional
account to be deleted, you can easily create ten more in as many
By reconfiguring current remailers to use a public Email service
as the last link in the chain, we tap a potentially infinite
supply of disposable accounts, on advertising-supported service
providers with skins as thick as those of the bulk emailers.
Sounds like a plan to me.

If we aren't going to actually shell out money for a worldwide
network of Eternity file servers, we have to use existing
publicly available services as our distributed data haven.
The more places we can stash things, the merrier.
Currently, we post documents to Usenet, and keep them alive by
reposting prior to the server expiring them.  This is robust, not
easily censored, and little effort.
I see nothing wrong with having the server also examine Dejanews
for Eternity documents, lightly stegoed to avoid the deletion of
encoded data.  To the extent that Dejanews serves as a more
permanent repository of data than Usenet, fine.  The worst thing
that can happen is that documents get removed, in which case, the
guardian of the document in question returns to keeping it alive
on Usenet.  All this is transparent to people using Eternity to
read documents.
Dejanews likely removes encoded data because of storage
requirements, not because of content.  Unless the Eternity
business becomes a significant fraction of Usenet bandwidth,
stego wars with Dejanews are unlikely.

Dejanews started in 1995.  By 1996, they had 80 million articles
in 15,000 Usenet newsgroups.  They currently have 109 million
articles.  The Dejanews database is presently 180 gigabytes. They
index all the "most active" Usenet newsgroups, minus binaries and
some other controversial content.
A week of a full Usenet feed is presently just a tad over 20
gigabytes, and is growing by leaps and bounds.

Not very.  You are tossing out one of the most useful aspects of
Usenet news as a Distributed File System, namely acting as a
"Giant FIFO" of what is interesting during any particular window
of time.

None at all.  Keeping everything that had ever been posted to
Usenet forever would be a giant waste of resources.
What I suspect you need here is the "Distributed File System" of
the future, which could carry Usenet as well as support Web, NFS,
FTP, and all other popular protocols to access its content.
It would be a giant FIFO with hundreds of gigabytes of capacity,
with reliable transport, authentication, encryption, and a
micropayment system for accessing and prolonging the lifetime of
data stored on it.  It would of course be uncensorable, as Usenet
is today, and the Eternity Service could run on top of it, as
well as a lot of other interesting things.

It's certainly interesting to think of what the ultimate DFS for
the Internet might look like, given the various white papers on
NC, thin clients, fat servers, and big pipes.
But this isn't something that is going to happen overnight.  To
the extent that we employ Usenet in interesting new ways as a DFS
today, we create working models of many of these concepts and
demonstrate their feasibility.

First of all, instead of thinking of this in terms of being the
singing and dancing Usenet archive of all time, we would do much
better if we thought of it as a protocol-independent Network-wide
Distributed File System with configurable characteristics suited
to a wide variety of applications.
If we could put together a prototype with a small number of
nodes, and demonstrate it could carry both Usenet and Eternity as
well as provide NFS3 access to commonly requested Network
binaries, all supported by an integrated micropayment scheme,
that would go a long way towards making it a standard.
Would anyone care to donate some storage, cycles, and a fast pipe
to the Net?

Steve Writes:
It strikes me that when material is ruled to be too dangerous to be
allowed in the community, it must be based on how the material affects the
typical well-adjusted citizen.  The so-called "reasonable person"  test. We certainly can't go around banning everything that might send some kook
off on a tangent or crusade, and goodness knows, were such a standard to
be adopted, the Bible would be the first thing on the bonfire.
So it would seem that the court is saying one of two things.  Either that
the average American citizen has so much psychological baggage concerning
sex and children, that he or she experiences uncontrolled arousal upon
being exposed to it, and leaps off to find children to show the material
to and perform sex acts on.  Or that American citizens collectively have
so much psychological baggage concerning sex and children, that they
through their elective representatives have chosen to make sexual
depictions of children the sole exception to Constitutional guarantees of
freedom of expression. Either way, it is hardly a stirring testimony to the mental health of the
nation. While I suspect the typical citizen is unlikely to have a particularly
strong reaction one way or the other to sexual depictions of children, as
long as it is not a photographic record of an actual child being treated
abusively, there is a obvious subset of frothy pointy-headed individuals
who should be shielded from such material at all costs, or they may be
completely unable to control their behavior.  They are of course the self-appointed "child protectors", none of whom
could care less about what rights children really need or want, as long as
no one appears naked.      Mike Duvos         $    PGP 2.6 Public Key available     $

WHAT!? The "alleged victim" describes officers beating him and then shoving a
toilet plunger up his rectum and down his throat while yelling "Take that,
Nigger!"  He has a broken jaw, a punctured rectum, and a torn bladder, a
colostomy, and will require multiple surgeries to repair all the damage. The police officers initially covered up for eachother, and the guilty cop
was only turned over to internal affairs when the cops realized that they
had a situation so serious that they couldn't lie their way out of it. It will be interesting to see whether he is charged with anything serious,
what sort of defense he concocts, whether his fellow officers testify
against him. In other news, a Texas jury refused to indict a marine who shot an 18 year
old goatherder tending his flock near the Mexican border.  After the
shooting, the marines claimed that the man had fired first, but this
excuse seems to be crumbling as the investigation continues. An interesting newsday, as Tim McVeigh is sentenced to death, and quotes

@_subject: Picketing With Packets 
I availed myself of some free home page enhancements on the Web
yesterday, and all of a sudden, my SPAM has increased by at least
an order of magnitude.  Obviously, one or more of the sites I
visited sold my email address to Mr. Spamford.
I am now getting almost continuous Cyberpromo, EmailBlaster, and
SubmitKing mailings as well as one from some female entrepreneur
in Singapore who wants me to send her US$10 to email me obscene
stories.  (sigh)
The time has come to make an example of Wallace Spamford, and to
mount his stuffed carcass on the gates of the Internet as a
warning to those who might be tempted to follow in his footsteps.
The following was suggested to me by someone on IRC this morning,
and I think it's a pretty nifty idea.  We write a little Perl
script that keeps exactly ONE AND ONLY ONE TCP connection open to
each of Mr. Spamford's machines.  Keeping a single TCP connection
open to someone's box is unlikely to be illegal, and does not
constitute a Denial of Service attack.  Consider it the packet
equivalent of a single person picketing.
We publish the script, and encourage every Sysadmin who hates Mr.
Spamford to run it.  When thousands do so, he will be out of
sockets, and consequently out of business.  Consider this the
packet equivalent of the UPS strike.  We can make the scripts
clever, and have them goose a wide variety of ports on Mr.
Spamford's machines.  He can, of course, devise a technical
defense against this, but he does not have one installed at
present, and it will shut him down for the time being, and give
him sufficient time to ponder his evil ways.
This also has the advantage of distributing the liability over
thousands of individuals, a technique shown in the recent uunet
UDP to render legal redress impractical.
Anyone have any comments on this scheme, or anything even more insidious to suggest?

Jim Bell is an example of an individual screwed by the government
using overly vague statues for alleged crimes which amounted to
little more than a few high school type pranks.
He took names of assholes who harrassed him, gave a made-up
number to a few people, and made the IRS doormat smell bad.  How
much, if any taxes, were evaded as a result of one of these
charges isn't even an issue.

information depicting the government's true colors should be

Those of you who have been following the efforts of CPAC and their
associates to render homeless certain web sites which they feel might be
frequented by thought criminals might find the following an interesting
case of "strange bedfellows."
It is apparent that CPAC doesn't like opposing points of view,
particularly when they are seen in public forums hosted by CPAC on the
Web.  Messages which don't toe the CPAC party line mysteriously vanish and
forums are frequently erased in their entirety when anything resembling a
discussion appears.
Now CPAC has claimed some new territory in their war to silence their
critics.  They maintain that no one who does not agree with their agenda
may show a link to any of their publicly available resources on the Web,
and that doing so constitutes theft of their bandwidth. They quote as their cite for this concept a piece by Brad Templeton,
ClariNet owner, who apparently shares their view that links can constitute
copyright infringement under certain circumstances.  Fortunately, Brad does not restrict linking to the article in question, from which I offer
the following tiny snippet under the "Fair Use" doctrine.  > I, and many other people initially had the intuitive feeling that it
 > could never be a violation of copyright to make a link to a web page.
 > Of late, I've come to think that this might be wrong. Now what CPAC objects to is people who post messages saying, essentially, "Look at the silly CPAC people rant and froth.  "
I would suggest that CPAC is a political organization, with a very well-defined social agenda, which I have every right to comment on, and that illustrative hyperlinks in my commentary constitute "Fair Use"
of their content.
Am I on firm legal ground here?

Two months ago, I wouldn't have known CPAC from a hole in the

attempts at "Ideological Cleansing" on the World Wide Web.
I had a pretty good idea what the organizational agenda was when

Most of CPAC's visible agenda is pretty reasonable.  It's the
part about harrassing legal First Ammendment protected speech on
the Net, based on their perception of the sexual orientation of
the people engaging in it, because supposedly such people might
*SOMEDAY* commit a crime, that is a bit of a civil liberties
Like most Dworks, they believe in "voodoo molestation," where
unnamed children thousands of miles away are vicariously
"exploited" should a single stranger have "impure thoughts" about
them by looking at even innocuous photographs, or should accurate
depictions of childhood sexuality be permitted in mainstream
media. They are getting their nonsense written into the law one
tiny step at a time, the Hatch "synthetic sexual depictions of

What's really amazing is how much under the table support the

@_subject: A Distributed Network Cache Service 
I've been thinking a bit about the micropayment-based distributed
network file system of the future.
It should be scalable, with the addition of servers being a
simple process.  Anyone should be able to run a server.
Kidnapping a server should disclose nothing about the contents of
files stored there.  Which files are stored on which servers
should be concealed from mere users of the network.
Anyone should be able to use the system by connecting to the
server nearest them.  Deterministic routing between servers
should be used by servers to provide files to other servers.
The system should provide for replication of files on a fixed
number of servers, with "k of n" parts being sufficient for
Aside from replication done for reliability, there should be only
one copy of a file in the system at any time.  If multiple users
submit the same file, there should be no more copies than if one
user submitted it.
The architecture of the system should be completely independent
of any specific file system organization, and any user should be
able to sync all or any part of his file system with the network
file system, or cache against the network file system on his
local machine.
The system should be completely secure, even from operators of
servers.  The person submitting a file receives a secret
necessary for its reconstruction, and the file may only be
accessed by the owner and those to whom the secret is
communicated.  The war room at the Pentagon and TCMay should be
able to use the same server as an extension of their local file
systems without any security worries.
Let's consider the following service...
Bob has an string of 100,000 octets he wants to make available to
Alice and a few of their closest friends.  Bob makes a secure
connection to a Trusted Agent doing business with the network
file system, and gives the Trusted Agent the string, and a
micropayment of $1/MB or 10 cents.  Working in a secure box, the
Trusted Agent batch compresses and scrambles Bob's string into a
much smaller string of seemingly random bits, and gives Bob two
128 bit values, a TAG, which will identify Bob's data to Bob, and
to anyone else Bob may wish to share his data with, and a
CONTEXT, which will unravel Bob's data back into its original
form.  The Trusted Agent then signs Bob's data, declaring that
the resulting digital coccoon produced from Bob's data is
associated with the TAG, and that the CONTEXT necessary to
recover the data has been communicated to Bob and all copies
destroyed.  The agent gives Bob the TAG and CONTEXT, and sends
the processed data and the TAG to the distributed file system,
and it is stored on one or more of its servers for the next 100
days, after which it expires.
For the next 100 days, Bob and all of his friends may use the 256
bit TAG/CONTEXT pair in place of Bob's data and may serve that
data for free any number of times off any network file system
server.  They simply make a secure connection to any server, and
send the TAG.  The server returns to them the seemingly random
stream of bits, after which a freeware program takes that data
and the CONTEXT, and regenerates the original data.
After 100 days, bob may fork over another 10 cents for another
100 days, or his data will disappear.  The TAG assigned to an
Octet String is unique, and no two strings have the same TAG, and
no string is ever assigned multiple tags, no matter how often it
may be entered and purged from the system.
Now, almost everything you could want from a network wide
distributed file system can be carried on top of this simple
service, which might be considered a system of temporary lodging
for popular Octet Strings.
You rent your Octet String a room, where you and people you
authorize may have unlimited visits for 100 days, and at the end,
your Octet String checks out for parts unknown.
One can do an almost unlimited number of useful things with such
a service which, given a fast network connection, allows you to
store any file in 256 bits for a period of time ranging from 100
days to forever, for a small fee.
Bob could back up his entire file system to the network, sending
each individual file or directory as an Octet String, with hard
links to files replaced with TAG/CONTEXT pairs.  The TAG/CONTEXT
pair for Bob's root directory would then be used to access Bob's
file system off any network server.  If Bob changed some files,
he could resync his FS with the server by only updating a few
Octet Strings.  If Bob synced his FS with the network daily, and
jotted down the TAG/CONTEXT pair for his root directory, Bob
could mount his file system as it appeared at backup time for any
of the last 100 days, with no replication of material on the
servers that contained it.
Bob could write a "compression" program, Bobzip, which would
produce an "archive" where each file only took 256 bits of space,
and which could be "unBobzipped" on any machine connected to the
Network for the next 100 days.  Bob could mail this small
"archive" to his friends.
If browsers understood URLs referencing the distributed file
system, Usenet binaries could be replaced with appropriate
pointers in Usenet articles, ending the endless replication of
binaries on thousands of machines, and reducing Usenet back to a
managable volume of data.
Users could boot their machines off the Network, and instantly
see gigabytes of software available to them.  After syncing their
cache file system with the network, they could drop their PC off
the roof, buy another one, and by typing in just one TAG/CONTEXT
pair, see all their files again.
Cache proxys could be set up which would grab files from the
servers and provide NFS access to them, permitting other hosts to
export NNTP, HTTP, and FTP access to the distributed network data.
I would imagine a typical useful node in such a distributed
system would need about 10 gig of disk, a fast network
connection, and a reasonably fast processor.  Such a node could
hold 100 meg of compressed data for each of the 100 days until
the space was reused.  At full utilization, each node would
generate in excess of $100 a day of revenue at $1/MB.

@_subject: Adding Memory to the Net 
A few people have commented on my "Distributed Network Cache
Service" suggestion since I posted it, and I would like to
respond to their comments.
The basic idea here is to add memory to the Net in a reliable
way, so that the Net provides memory services in the way it now
universally provides data transport services.  The Net would then
serve compressed encrypted Octet Strings to machines connected to
it, and provide a consistant view of which Octet Strings were
available at any point in time which was independent of the
access point.  Adding Octet Strings to the universe of available
ones, with a specified lifetime, would involve a micropayment.
Computers connected to the Net could then employ either Octet
Strings or fixed length data consisting of a cryptographic hash
and decryption key to describe any chunk of data, which would
reduce the storage requirements of hosts accordingly. Replication
and synchronization of data would be the responsiblity of the
totality of machines providing the cache service, and would
augment the storage capacity of ordinary hosts which often
replicate data excessively and synchronize it poorly.
As Lucky Green correctly points out, since the cache service
would effectively serve prepared digital coccoons whose contents
were not visible to it, protocols would be needed to ensure that
data was not spoofed.  However, this is a "who do cache servers
trust to give them data" issue, and not a "how do we serve the
data and provide a Network-wide consistant view of the database"
Such a system, implemented efficiently, could carry the Eternity
service, reliable network news, and serve as a distribution point
for all freeware.  It could have terabytes of storage, using a
fraction of the resources now consumed by the endlessly
replicated news spools of hosts on the Net.
It would be as uncensorable as Usenet, and survive the
destruction or compromise of a large number of cache servers in
the system.  It would be reliable, and no ones data would be
visible to anyone else.
I think such a service is the "World File System"
reduced to its most basic principles, upon which endless other
useful services may be based.

That may be premature.  Real PGP signatures can only be generated
by the owners of PGP private keys, and they vary with the
contents of the document being signed.  This identifies the
person who signs a document, and prevents undetected alterations.
Clearly, you cannot use the same signature on more than one
message, or have someone else give you a signature to use, or
anyone could fake signing a message.

When you sign a document with PGP, the document is converted into
a unique number, which it is statistically unlikely any other
document will generate.  Then this unique number is raised to the
power of an exponent only you know, modulo the product of two
large probable primes.  The result is converted to a printed
ASCII string, which is appended to the message with text
identifying it as a PGP signature.
Others wishing to make sure you have signed the document, and
that it has not been altered, can raise this number to the power
of a publicly known exponent, modulo the product of the same two
large probable primes.  The secret exponent which you used to
sign and the public exponent you give others to verify your
signatures, have the property that raising to the power of both
of them leaves a number unaltered.  If the result matches the
unique number the document generates, then it was signed by you
and no changes were made to it.
Isn't that neat?
So basically you don't need to get your signature from anyone.
You need to get a copy of PGP, and generate your own PGP key
using the PGP -kg option.  Then you can post your public key to
the keyservers, and sign documents with it.
Others can use your public key to check your signatures, and also
to encrypt documents in a way only you can decrypt.
This is all explained in the PGP documentation, which comes with
the PGP program.
Good luck.

The thing to realize here is that NCMEC is an agency which
receives almost 100% of its funding from government agencies, one
of which is the Juvenile Justice division of the US DOJ.
It has about as much to do with childrens' rights as aardvarks
have to do with starship design.  It exists primarily so that
news organizations can point and say "Childrens' Advocates
Praised the President's Decision" every time childrens' civil
liberties are further reduced, or some laughable new definition
of child porn is criminalized.
In addition, it helps to conduct the war against imagined
pedophiles, both at home and abroad, and enforces the property
rights of parents against any minor under the age of 18 who dares
to leave their bed and board.  These two agendas may be easily
combined, since if one is not with ones parents, one is obviously
in the clutches of an exaltation of pedophiles grooming one for a
life of sexual depravity.
While reasonable people would see little problem in popular adult
web sites also posting missing childrens' pictures, NCMEC toes
the child sex hysteric party line, and accepts links only from
ideologically pure "Save the Children" organizations, like CPAC,
which engage in content-based harrassment of perfectly legal
material, and which subscribe to the doctrine of "Voodoo
Molestation" when otherwise ordinary photographs are viewed.
If you're a missing or exploited child, seek the services of a
good childrens' legal advocate, not NCMEC, unless of course you
wish to have your picture on numerous grocery items, be returned
to your parents in handcuffs, and be used to promote someone
elses political agenda, the only "services" NCMEC has ever
managed to provide to children in need.

When Federico Fellini made his 1960 film, "La Dolce Vita," where Marcello

I'm still a fan of my "Network Cache Server" approach to
anonymous message pools and distributed data bases, even if only
to reduce spam and provide a completely reliable Usenet.
This then embeds into the Net three levels of communication, with
varying degrees of latency and reliability.
       UDP:  Alice says, "Here's some octets for Bob.  I hope
             they don't get lost in transit."
       TCP:  Alice and Bob are within sight of each other and
             toss octets back and forth, each replacing any the
             other fails to catch.
       NCS:  Alice says to her local cache service, "Here are
             some octets which expire in 10 minutes and a
             micropayment."  Alice gets a 256 bit receipt,
             which may be presented to any other cache server
             to retrieve Alice's octets in the next 10 minutes.

This is really a user action item, not a Cyperpunks action item.
The techology to do this already exists.  Like most people, I

Correct.  This continuous brute-forcing of wider and wider keys
has ceased to entertain.  Unless someone comes up with a way to
make less computing power do more keys, I'm really not interested
in hearing about it.
Of course, the first such efforts served to show how distributed
efforts could be mounted on the Net, how much computing power you
could snarf for free, and other interesting things.  However, now
that these things are known, repeating the experiment every week
is not necessary.
