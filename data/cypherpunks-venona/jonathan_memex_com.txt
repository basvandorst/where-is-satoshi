I don't see how using PGPified mailing lists help at all
(with the assumtion that anyone can subscribe). I mean, anyone
can simply subscribe to the list and then read all of the traffic.
What's the point? Anyways...
    I *can*, however, see the use of using PGP encryption for
mailing list submissions, expecially combined with an aliasing
feature. (i.e. the mailing list has a key pair, and people send
mail to it). Possibly even accepting something like the cypherpunk
remailer format (i.e.:
anon-post-from: bob
etc... ). This, however, *might* be going to far for some people's
comfort, because it would allow *COMPLETELY* untraceable posts
(depending on the security of the site, but that's another issue).
You can do other remailer-type traffic analysis defeaters like
sending out the posts in random order at fixed intervals, etc.
See above. Also, a couple problems with encrypting it to each person on the list  is that it takes:
  Space for all of the keys
  Time to encrypt EACH message to each person
Both of which quickly become a problem on high-volume lists such as cypherpunks.
Also, it requires that EVERYONE use PGP if they want to read the list. This, I  believe, is an unacceptable requirement.

It's 1 atmosphere for every 33 feet, but either way, I don't see how
you managed to get 4.5 * the rate. At around 3 atmospheres, you're using air at about 4 times the 1 atmosphere rate.
Hmmm. I believe that the diving depth-to-time tables (which I don't have
in front of me. I'll get them out and double check later) give a
time of around 25 minutes. It has nothing to do with how much air you
have. The tables are used to avoid the bends and nitrogen narcosis.

Alan Barret  wrote to Cypherpunks:
The problem is, if you are using an interface to PGP, most of the time  they use PGP in batchmode to check the signature, and they don't let you  see the output. This means people go "Check the signature", PGP says "Good  signature found", and they think that it has never been modified. This is  a security hole. Not everyone uses PGP to do everything from the command  line. Plus, using lines with only a tab in them, it's possible to add  seperated paragraphs and "normal-looking" text.
Here's an example:
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Note that this paragraph was added *AFTER* this message was digitally  Note also that the line above this paragraph contains *1* tab. Using this,  it's possible to add as much stuff to the beginning of a clearsigned  message as you want, with it looking completely natural, and checking  fine. This *IS* a security hole.
This para was also added later.
Test message
My public key follows, after this signed message:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6.1
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
