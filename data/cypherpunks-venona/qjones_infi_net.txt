I used to work for the govt and I could classify anything by just writing either secret confidential of Foyes. It doesnt take much to classify.
As an EE in ECM plexing noise is easy. Decrypting just takes the Massives
a few hours longer. I just work for a living ,Ithink for myself.

The "roadblocks" put up by intelligence is no surprise. Afterall what did
happen to the 10 millions of the Iran-Contra drug money? What about the DEA agent who stole several hundred thousand dollars in drug money?
  FinCen is one way of hiding the illegal drug escapades of the intelligence community. *  Qjones               So I'm a dog...what else is new?          *

With FLIR you have SLIR  OTH UV  LOW LIGHT  from the military (Billy boy
is itching to deploy here in the good ole USA). Remote Sensing RADAR SONAR
Stealth RADAr, Remote Imaging SYStems all kinds of goodies coming home.
TO do what..fight crime..Yeah right. I remember law and order Nixon.
  Cryptography is the least of your problems. A high tech military is
coming home and Billy wants to put them to use on our streets..>!!!

Ok genuises. The above subject mentioned FLIR talking about apying in the IR spectrum. SLIR is Side Looking Infrared Radar, OTH is Over the Horizon, UV is UltraViolet (existing light) Low Light speaks for itself.
 Remote Sensing and Remote Imaging is what I am involved in. Stealth is
basically passive radar. Take it from there....
