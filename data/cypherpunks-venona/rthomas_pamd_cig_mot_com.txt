good points, Christian!
more and more, networks are becoming flooded with X traffic.  although X
has always been known to be a potential security hole, i think X-attacks
are going to increase dramatically in the coming months.
i commonly hear of sights with Xauthority enabled, only to have the user
community type "xhost +" at the prompt.  bad karma.  the days of pumping
rude & crass noises to someone else's workstation will soon graduate to
more nefarious and insidious attacks.
is anyone looking into a means of securing X (above and beyond the current
weak solutions)?

perhaps not.  however, i would bet that the PR dept. at Netscape could
answer your questions.  have you even *attempted* to contact Netscape
directly?  or are your questions merely rhetorical ramblings?

look, this is just a *bit* extreme.  having been one of those folks sworn
to uphold the Constitution, i can tell all of you that there is no master
plan to rid the American people of their rights and freedom.
this is not to say we should not keep a sharp and keen eye open for any
assault upon our liberties.  rather, having "BEEN THERE", i just do not
see any threat along the lines of, er, Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, et. al.
let's try to keep this in perspective, Fred.  perhaps a little less
caffiene would help?  ;-)
a former U.S. government employee...but i won't say where...;-)
