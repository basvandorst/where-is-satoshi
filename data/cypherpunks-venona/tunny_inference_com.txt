Thanks for the pointer.  I was reading through their nicely
organized gentle introduction to basic concepts, when I nearly
sprayed coffee all over my monitor from laughing so hard at
the following gaffe:
"...most modern codes rely on the intractable mathematical
problem of 'factorisation'. This is the process of trying to
find the two prime factors that, multiplied together, would
give you a third prime number. [JT: Yes, I'd call that an
intractable problem, all right.] For example, if you take
3337 - a prime number (i.e. a number that has precisely two
divisors) - how would you find its two prime factors? (They
are, in fact, 47 and 71.)"
A little unclear on that "prime" thing, it sounds like... :-)

@_subject: Local news botches RSA story 
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
On the local San Fransisco Bay Area news early this morning (I think it
was KRON, the local NBC affiliate -- I'm new around here), there was a
story about RSA Inc. licensing encryption technology to the People's
Republic of China -- about a $200 million deal, if I understood
correctly.  Given that RSA is a local company, care to guess how the
story was presented?  "Local hi-tech company makes inroads in global
market?"  "Restrictive government regulations make life tough for U.S.
software companies?"  No, the lead-in and thrust of the story was
"Export of advanced technology will hamper U.S. spy efforts"!  They had
some heavily edited bits from Jim Bidzos, who at least got to make
mention of the "genie being out of the bottle", and the fact that if
they can't buy it from us, they'll get it from someone else, but the
clueless newsies really butchered this one.  RSA was made out to look
like they were selling out their country to make a buck, over the
protests of the government (in fact, the deal obviously received
government approval).
I don't know the details of the deal (I couldn't find anything on
RSA's web page), but it sounded like the software was (as
expected) export-crippled, though Bidzos made some comment about
it being "upgradable".  Anyone have any more details on this?
I expect the report will air again -- maybe some Bay Area cpunks
can catch it and provide some more feedback.  There may even be an
opportunity to educate the local media, though I don't hold out a
lot of hope...

@_subject: RE: Private key server 
I don't know about you, but I can certainly remember enough bits to be
secure.  The fact that passphrases are so widely used goes to show that
I'm not the only one that can do this.
[Darth Vader voice:] "Don't overestimate the entropy of your passphrase"
Let's see, 128 bits (say) of info, mapped comfortably into the upper case letters and digits (5 bits/char), means a string of about 26 *really random* characters.  An example might be "KQI8CH49SCK3PKWNA37AYV9QJ5".  If that just rolls off your toungue, you have my respect (and I have pi memorized to 110 decimal places!)  This assumes a full 5 bits of entropy/character.  If your passphrase is more coherent (i.e., less entropy) than that, like "Strange kr0ws fly 1azily at MIDnight", it almost certainly contains _far_ less entropy than that.  128 bits of truly arbitrary (random) info is a fair amount of information to comfortably Mind you, I think a properly constructed passphrase (like the one above) is pretty darn resistant against any sort of reasonable dictionary or quasi-brute force attack.  But I don't think it's got anywhere near, say, 128 bits of entropy.  Probably closer to half that.
Anyway, the point I was making that this method would be preferable to a
"secret key server".  My proposal would offer the same security, would
it not?
(The secret key server is arguably less secure than generating keys from
passphrases, since key generation takes longer than IDEA decryption -
however, they are still of the same order).
Using a pass phrase to seed key generation (or more directly, using the hash of a pass phrase as a key) does not increase the entropy, of course.  Not sure if this is relevant to your claim, as I've sort of lost track of the original context!

[...Interesting discussion of logarithms deleted...]
The discrete logs used in crypto have very different mathematical
properties than regular logarithms, but I thought this bit of history
would spark some memories in old-timers and give a new perspective for
younger people.
As an apparent old-timer (calculators weren't common until my college days, which puts me a couple of years before you, I guess) I enjoyed the retrospective, and I even recall the joke that goes with the punchline you quoted.  It's amazing to realize that only a few years ago, we were calculating orbital trajectories using logarithms by lining up marks on little sticks of wood!  I have to admit, though, that I was a little disappointed after your opening paragraph, because what I was really hoping to hear was a straightforward explanation of discrete logs, which, as you say, are entirely different.  A simple layman's explanation of what they are and how they're useful in crypto would be nice, especially since PGP is moving toward this (just when I was beginning to get a handle on RSA!).
Now that I have an interest in all this, I wish Rich Schroeppel still worked here (he worked at Inference when I started here in '88, and has since done a lot of pioneering work on discrete logs).  Me, I'm still trying to figure out what sort of seed is best to plant in a Galois  James A. Tunnicliffe   | WWWeb:  Inference Corporation  | PGP Fingerprint:   CA 23 E2 F3 AC 2D 0C 77

Why does it follow that these must be crackable, or the government would
have outlawed them? Despite recent moves to limit encryption, there are
currently NO domestic (U.S.) restrictions on crypto.  Nothing prohibits
you from using a true One Time Pad, which is mathematically proven to be
unbreakable, now and forever, even against infinite resources.  If this
is not prohibited (and it isn't), doesn't that refute your argument?
You may find it impossible that the masses are allowed to use truly

Dale Thorn writes (in part):
But you've described exactly what PGP does.  It encrypts the message
with a "good, trusted private-key system" -- IDEA, which has undergone
significant peer review, has a long-enough key (128 bits), and has
exhibited no significant weaknesses or shortcuts to brute force (which
is impossible, given the key length).  It then encrypts the IDEA session
key that was used with the recipient's public key, and bundles the the
IDEA-encrypted message and the RSA-encrypted session key (and
optionally, a signed hash of the message) for delivery to the recipient.

Sigh. I really don't have time for unimaginative trollers, and
you've caught your limit, so into the killfile you go. Still, I
would appreciate it if you could see your way clear to quit
posting these trolls on cypherpunks, since it does make it harder
to effectively filter the responses from people who make the
mistake of taking you seriously.
Thank you for your kind consideration,

Mike Gurski asks:
I believe it can be.  Until a few years ago, it was common to request
a credit card AND TO RECORD THE NUMBER ON THE CHECK.  Legislation was
enacted (this might have been just in California, I'm not sure) to
prevent them from recording the number, but I believe it specifically
allowed them to continue to ask to see that you have a card (they
shouldn't need to see the number, so I believe you are within your
rights to, say, obscure it with your thumb).
Of course, they are (and should not be) under any obligation to accept
your check in the first place, so I would think the ID they request
would be up to them.

I found the logic questionable, but more disturbing was the fundamental
position that "loss of privacy [...] is a price that must be paid to
gain security".  Benjamin Franklin's statement about security and
freedom comes strongly to mind when I hear nonsense like this.  He then
cites the (in "our" view, useless and intrusive) hassles that airline

@_subject: RE: Why are 1024 bit keys the limit right now? 
In just about every way possible... :-)
The RSA algorithm can use keys of arbitrary length.
All current versions of PGP allow key sizes up to 2048* bits.  (When
asked for the size of the key to generate, it allows you to select 512,
768, 1024, OR TO *TYPE IN THE NUMBER OF BITS DESIRED*.) There are older,
partially incompatible versions that allow even larger keys, though
there is little reason to go higher. Beyond something like 3100 bits, it
is surmised that the 128-bit IDEA session key is easier to attack. As for prime numbers, no, 1024 bits isn't even close to the largest
found (there are of course an infinite number of primes).  The latest
discovery was of a Mersenne prime, the 35th such found. It was 1,398,269
bits long (all 1's, of course).
Tunny * OK, there is a minor bug in 2.6.2 that in some cases limits keys to
"only" 2047 bits -- the difference is utterly insignificant in terms of
security.  This message is signed by such a 2047-bit key.  James A. Tunnicliffe   | WWWeb:  Inference Corporation  | PGP Fingerprint:   CA 23 E2 F3 AC 2D 0C 77
