This is not "quite true"
1)   for (2^n)-1 to be prime, it is indeed necessary that n is prime
     (if n=pq then 2^p-1 divides 2^n-1)
     however (2^n)-1 is not prime for all prime n
     prime numbers of the form 2^n-1 are called Mersenne primes
     there are some 30 known Mersenne primes for the moment
     (could send interested people a list of the ones I know--see also      Knuth, volume 2 for some interesting stuff about primes)
2) (2^(2^n))+1 is certainly not true for all n, though I don't know
   any particularly values for which it doesn't hold (I thought
   2^128+1 was NOT a prime)
   primes numbers who happen to be of the form (2^(2^n))+1 are called    Fermat primes. Some pretty large ones are known (could send a list...)
3) I don't know about the third stated formula
Hope this straightens things out...

This last step (therefore p+1 is a prime) is not totally correct. You forgot the posibility p+1 NOT prime, but some prime number pn divides p+1. This number is prime and >pn.
So in any case there would exist a prime >pn, which contradicts the
hypothesis, and the conclusion is indeed:
