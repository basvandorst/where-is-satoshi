In fact it's not difficult.  It's quite simple to estlablish new identity for the individual willing to risk the charges and consequences of exposure.  The basic impediment is time.  Good credit doesn't come overnight.  The second impediment is tax evasion- which is less than justifiable in the United States on the grounds of privacy.  If you're willing to be patient, and pay taxes on more than one name, its easy to maintain several identities.
Which tells me how serious you really are about your privacy.  You have made a decision here about how much trouble privacy is worth to you, which is "not much."
I hear people bitch about privacy endlessly.  Privacy helps those who help themselves to privacy.  I think Mr. May was precisely correct in saying that it is so much easier and simpler for one to rely on self privacy insurance rather than government privacy insurance.

I don't see how the net will eliminate the basic need for highly qualified professionals and the proof that they have credentials.  Perhaps diplomas and such will be transfered into digital signatures for the institutions, but I can't see how this "cracks" any "monopoly."  Perhaps the monopoly is shifted to those who have diplomas, rather than those "licensed to practice" but so what?

Examples of "text tracking" in documents where language specificity is important (legal, scientific) are typically marked with changes in the justification scheme, i.e. the number of spaces to the right, number of lines to a page, number of pages total, etc. etc.
Clearly it is much more difficult to apply in digital schemes, but consider that in order to modify the scheme to avoid traceback to the distributer, one of two conditions must exist.
1>  The distributer must be close to the initial release point.
  (If not, then all documents ABOVE the distributer in the chain will be    text tracked, and all the documents BELOW the distributer will not.     Clearly this will brand the distributer).
2>  The distributer must be entirely outside the 'legal' distribution scheme.
Remember also that uniform modification of text tracking methods is itself identifying unless several 'illegal' distributers are using the same sanitizing method.
The same way you can get surgery to have fingerprints removed, but the resulting scars make you all the more identifiable.

Didn't I just say this above?
A centralized, or several centralized authorities.
I guess the center of my question is, how can you apply Web of Trust to e.g. a university degree.  Who cares what Bob and Alice think my degree is in, the client only wants to know from the institution.
  Licensing can only be done by an
I believe you are incorrect, but I guess my main concern is your characterization of "Physical force."  I am assuming you mean coercion, and not that you will be jailed or such (though this may be the case).
I would argue that as long as coercion exists (violence of any type, physical or not) you have a licensing authority.  Take the hollywood blacklist.  No one actually pushed around suspected pinko screenwriters (well, at least, if anyone did, it was incendential) but they certainly faced a great deal of persuasive motivation.  Look at the committee as the licensing authority here.  (Licensing you as a non-communist as it were).
If several governmental and private authorities were in the practice of certifing that Bob has a law degree from Tremont University, and that he is competent to practice in D.C., and given that the citizens of D.C. will look for these credentials, isn't this a license?  Afterall, Bob has to pass some test or requirement to get the signatures.  Isn't this coercion in your definition?  Can't the multiple authorities set common or near common guidelines?  Rather, don't they HAVE to in order to have their signatures worth the electrons they are transmitted with?
If you take the exteme position you seem to, there's an antitrust case here.
Am I not "licensing" my key signature to people provided they pass my key signature criteria?  Am I not doing violence by withholding my signature and the benefits it might convey for certain "terms?"
In this definition, all trusted authorities are by definition licensing.  Either their signature is worth nothing, and thus they are not coercive by witholding it, or it is worth something, and thus to be non-coercive they must give it to anyone who asks, rendering their signatures worthless.
This is the trap of the licensing argument.
The evil is not licensing, which I think serves a real purpose, but created convenience fees, taxation through the withholding of licensing and the use of other government largess.   I wrote a massive piece on this and sent it to the list about a year and a half ago.  With interest I will repost it.
The real question is how you decide what an authority to license is.  Is it to be dictated by government?  Or by market forces (i.e. the reputation of the licenser).
Then why will lawyers, or a 'professional monopoly' be broken?
Now you are getting more specific.
Agreed.  Again, what does this do to lawyers?  See my above comments on what constitutes a license.
I'm not so sure.  There will be a tremendous amount of corporate power in these authorities, and if (as you seem to be saying a few paragraphs up) it is hard to break into the trusted certification business, there is a monopoly again.
Like the several state Bars?
Hint: An attorney licensed in Deleware has a much different speciality likely than one licensed in Alabama.
So you have estentially admitted that a central authority is required?  Or will be more often used?
So is this a license or what?  Looks like one to me.
If your defintion of license is simply who does the coercing, I think you should reconsider.

I think you have failed to apply them to other organizations.  Again, I think you are over amoured with hating "the state."  Many organizations not affiliated with government do violence to abstract properties.
If I am a producer in a horizontal territory limitation agreement for sales of wigets, and bob is not, bob's attempt to move into my area and sell widgets will be met with a boycott by all the members of my agreement.  Is this any less coercion?  I understand the violence is fairly dramatic coercion, but it is hardly the only coercion.  Do you not consider the Clipper program coercion?
I suggest you take a look at Nozick, Coercion, in Philisophy, Science and Method  (S. Morgenbessed ed. 1969) or Zimmerman, Coervice Wage Offers, 10 Phil & Pub. Aff. 121 (1981)  Also, see Kreimer, Allocational Sanctions: The Problem of Negative Rights in a Positive State, 132 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1293 (1984).
Personally I think Justice Stone had it correct with "Threat of loss, not hope of gain, is the essence of economic coercion."
You might also take a look at the Yale Law Review article by Reich:
(73 Yale 7 I think)
Exactly, it must be tied to some kind of authority.  In this case, the issuing institution is about the only acceptable one.
I stand by the contention that a University degree cannot be certified acceptably by an authority not in some way connected to the University.
You are using coercion in a different sense.  One of the definitions I get in Webster's (while force is incorporated in some others) is "to compel to do something by the use of power, intimidation or threats."
If you perfer that I use "serious persuasion" instead, fine, but I think you are just splitting hairs.
You needn't apologize, but I must admit, this looks a lot like coercion to me, as well as to Reich, and several justices of the Supreme Court.  Do you believe it impossible/insignificant to manipulate behavior by persuasive means other than violence or the threat of actual physical An example please?  With specific regard to certifing authorities and university degrees?
  I would
But certainly all lawyers must have some base level of certification, even if this is only market enforced?  i.e. no one would accept a lawyer with NO certification (or few enough people to make it impossible to be one with some certification) this being so, the withholding of the required certification is still co- er... persuasion, no?
I still am having trouble understanding your definition of coercion.
There is no PHYSICAL violence, this I have admitted, but the economic violence of such an act can be significant.  It seems that for you the distinction is in the emotional effect of the application of persuasive force, rather than the effect.
I've given this example before.
We take two convicted carjackers.
The first we sentence to 5 years, but after 4 years and 50 weeks, tell him that we are going to extend the sentence another 10 years unless he takes an experimental vaccine.
The second we sentence to 15 years, and after 4 years and 50 weeks, we tell this one that we will cut off 10 years from the sentence if he takes the experimental vaccine.
What's the difference?  Both have been given two choices
1>  Spend 15 years, no vaccine.
2>  Spend 5 years, take vaccine.
The point is that the first is emotionally more stacked, you feel sorry for the carjacker (well, maybe I should have picked crypto exporter) because he has been tricked.  When asked, 90% respond that the first is more "unfair."
Allowing emotion to cloud one's judgement of what is and is no coercive is a mistake.
Let me dig it up.
Absent another public request I will send it in E-Mail only.
I believe that your defining the words merely to distinguish who the certifing authority is confusing- and deceptive.
I still think you are mistaken in that I feel you are ignoring the fact that no market exists below a certain certification level, regardless of how diverse the certifiers are.  You also still miss that credentials for attorneies are already multidimensional.
[market monopolies are "softer" than government ones.]
I will point to the oil companies in the industrial age, as well as the railroads.  Certainly the potential for violence is not limited to government.  I hate this example, but in this particular case I think you are missing its context.
I'm not sure I follow you here.
Then how do you explain the points I have brought up.
The base requirement of a certification from an education institution (for which you have provided no substitute).
The existance of a floor, below which it is impractical to practice a profession and the existance of a set of entities (of whatever number) who's signatures are required to transcend this floor.
I think this construction is still flawed.  I will remain by my position that licensing is useful when not used to collect taxes or otherwise overregulate.  I also hold that the distinctions you make between licensing and certification are without functional difference in effect and are deceptive in that they suggest a significant difference in effect or purpose where there is none.

@_subject: Re: cryptography eliminates lawyers? 
Yes, in the context of competing credentialing institutions I agree, but even now there is a base certification for such institutions (accreditation) which is delved out by a central authority, or common standards.  What the other writer's approach missed was that one could not, in the end, do away with the basic requirement for some kind of standardization, even if it was market driven.
While I too prefer the market approach, I still contend that a floor of credentials will exist, and indeed, should exist.
But I believe there will still be a demand for an objective, or trusted authority in the market.  This was my point when I asserted that certificated from Bob and Alice that I was a decent attorney would not be sufficent for most unless Bob and Alice were trusted in the "attorney credential" area.  So in the end, isn't a trusted authority required to some degree?
I think the difference here, as opposed to the Web of Trust in e.g., PGP, is that you are talking about legal talent, or any professional talent, for which payment is being made.  It's easy to accept a signature from Mr. Mar indicating that Bob has (in Mr. Mar's opinion) decent key management habits, but it's asking a great deal to extend that trust in Mr. Mar to his opinion of Bob's legal skills.  For that there will be a demand of more detailed and certain expertise in Mr. Mar, and also a trust that Mr. Mar is not just helping an upstart friend of his make some money in consulting for nuclear physics projects.
i.e. it is very difficult to estlablish the objectivity of a certifier without some kind of public and significant risk on the part of the certifier coupled with some verifiable skill in appraising nuclear physics skill- a situation I would argue is almost impossible without a certificate from an institution which meets some base credentials, which are set up publically by a objective process, or nearly so.

Check cloner gets account number from ATM slip or otherwise. Check cloner prints up 30 "checks" in any name at all with magnetic ink account number on the bottom for the benefit of automatic readers at the bank.  Checks are written to the account in false name and withdrawn.
For some reason, the focus seems to be on the ease with which one opens an account- rather than with the need to safeguard account information, and the lack of oversight by banks.  Of course, the liability for these crimes is with the bank, which cleared a check without the proper Of course, the immediate solution, rather than insuring the banks pay their liability for their insecure payments and check clearing system, and their printing account information on any piece of paper they can find, is going to be a crackdown on account identification- and probably legislation.

New accounts can expect to have to cough up significant identification and I predict a re-newed call for national identification credentials.
Tell the banks they have to pay within 2 days of the presentation by the duped depositor of the fraudulent checks and I would lay odds that the banks would be screaming bloody murder for a more secure payments and check clearing system than the trash they have now.

At the risk of politicizing the issue, I wouldn't be the first to call this "left-speak" or "term-sanitizing."
Really the core issue is that the citizens of their respective nations need to either:
1>  See cryptography for the important individual rights issue that it is and latch on to the basic desire for free and unmonitored commerce and exchange without censorship or observation.
2>  Decide that they are not interested in the issues because these issues are too radical, or simply because their own political ideas fall left

The final judgement will be in the advantage of velocity and security of transactions and the wealth that this "allocates" to those wise enough to adopt crypto exchange systems.  Evolution in action.  If this makes me elitist, so be it.

When you begin compromising to meet the public sentiment you end up aiming for the middle.  "He who builds on the people builds on mud."  I believe this especially true in the United States.  The general population has no tolerance/time/interest in the deeper issues involved here, and are much more apt to bow to the "law and order" arguments made by the various political entities here.  These are emotional arguments to which Joe Sixpack is particularly open.  Enter the four horsemen.
I believe working to recruit "the people" and lobby "the leaders" to embrace the ramification of free and strong crypto is a losing game.  My money in information futures is going into "yes" certificates on the question of "Unescrowed Strong Crypto Banned in U.S. by 2000."
The fact that you need this question answered does more to rebuke your position than I ever could.
Be real.  What percentage of [insert nation here]'s citizens would be able to discuss strong encryption with anything more than a comic book i.e., the answer to your question is "mostly nothing."
You're error is in assuming Joe Sixpack desires or thinks he requires strong   How do you expect
I don't expect its legality to survive in the United States, nor do I expect it to survive despite "political pressure" (that nature of which which you conveniently do not idenfify) and finally, I don't expect Joe Sixpack, and his friends to exert any (undefined) political pressure- or care.
If people want to try and organize a crypto awareness program, fine.
If people want to try and organize a crypto propoganda program, count me out.
If you don't understand the difference, you need to study history and political science.
If Joe Sixpack can't deal with the core, unsanitized ramifications of strong crypto, Joe Sixpack isn't ready to have strong crypto.  This is, in my view, realism, and intellectual evolution in action.  If strong crypto is the advantage I suspect it will be, then those nations which use it will endow its citizens with those significant advantages, hopefully to the disadvantage of the banning nations.  With any luck, this will result in the eventual lack of world/market infulence of crypto-ignorant Joe Sixpacks.  This in my view is "a good thing."
I would like the United States to be pro-crypto, but I'm not sure I give the country and its current political system as a whole that much credit.
No, it is exactly the point.
And I believe them a waste of time because I feel that political and persuasive methods are useless *right now* or in the *foreseeable future*.
The only thing that will stop this legislation will be a sudden awakening of the American People to freedom of speech in the face of an offered and vague promise of "security."  (Read: Good Luck)
The FBI is screaming that strong crypto is nasty stuff to the Executive.  Certainly the intelligence agencies are doing the same.
The Executive is going to support if not outright push through a key forfeiture bill, and about all I can see standing in the way will be cost- which in this bill is going to be small.
So if you are so intouch with Joe Sixpack, what does he think?  Do you have some evidence to suggest that there is any widespread awareness of the issues among Joe and Jane?  Surveys?  Studies?  Anything?
Go out on the street and ask 10 random people.  Hell, ask 10 intellectuals not in the computer science field.  I think your level of disillusion will approach mine, and if not, then I do not give your powers of observation much credit.
I think you have a long wait.
Part of the entire issue here is securing your own privacy rather than letting the government do it for you.  By waiting for someone to TELL YOU that you are now ALLOWED to secure your own privacy, why are you any better than he who doesn't use strong crypto?  Instead you should, while perhaps allocate some effort to political concerns, be working to propogate crypto systems which are untraceable, do not bear the recipiants key identifier in each message, and otherwise able to endure a crypto "Dark Age" which I see right around the corner here.
In other words:
Secure it yourself.  Privacy comes to you only if you secure it yourself.  If you believe that political action is the way to do this, be my guest- I happen to think you are wasting your time.

Traffic analysis, jurisdiction, detection of encrypted data in stego'd I believe the basic problem will be one of avoiding detection and the ability to piggyback harmless looking files on "approved" encryption.
In the event your encrypted message were detected, it would be nice if it didn't announce its intended destination via a public key header.
I also believe that excessively large keys should be incorporated (2048/4096 bit RSA and 256 bit IDEA like encryption perhaps) to extend the
likely useful life of cyphers which will be difficult to distribute later.
I also would like to see applications which permit the user to select the from among a few types of encryption, in the event one is found to be broken.

As I understood the current implementation, stego is fairly easy to sniff out.  Am I mistaken in this?
Perhaps, but hardly as suspicious as sending naked random data.  I think given hard to sniff stego, and the nationwide bandwidth, this is a non-issue.

You'd have to argue that reverse engineering was mis-appropriation within the meaning of the rules, and that the data was tipped to the tippee's with the intent of gain.  In otherwords, you must have a fraud with respect to the rightful owner of the "misappropriated" information.  That an important commerce system is insecure, be it publicly held or whatever, when publically posted, is hardly misappropriation, or if it is alleged so, I'll defend the accused (if they are in my jurisdictions of license).

You prefered it when they were funding gunrunning and hostage negotiation with drug profits and abbetting smuggling?
Uh, you've not been looking.  Many have criticised the new emphasis as justification in a threatless environment.
A very interesting note has been published on the subject just recently.
Interested parties might want to check out:
Augustini, Jeff, "From Goldfinger to Butterfinger: The Legal and Policy Issues Surrounding Proposals to Use the CIA for Economic Espionage,"
26 Law & Pol'y Int'l Bus. 2 (Law and Policy in International Business, The
International Law Journal of Georgetown University Law Center).
While the author misses some key points, goes off on a silly anti-trust tangent which totally misreads the current state of antitrust law, and makes some outright misses on the legal logistics of passing the information through government channels, the work also holds some interesting research about the programs of Japan, France, Germany and Isreal.
Some Choice Parts:
'Intelligence officials in the United States estimate that at least twenty foreign nations are currently engaged in intelligence activities "detrimental to our economic interests...."'
'The White House Office on Science and Technology estimates losses to U.S. businesses from foreign economic espionage at nearly one hundred billion dollars per year.'
'Allegations within the French Government accuse U.S. personal, including four diplomats, attempted to steal secret government documents relating to Franco-American trade disputes.'
'A classified CIA report lists two top Japanese intelligence priorities as (1); intelligence regarding access to foreign sources of raw material and (2) "detailed intelligence on technological and scientific developments in the United States and Western Europe."'
'In addition to intelligence operations abroad, the French are notorious for routinely eavesdropping on, and conducting "bag jobs" against, U.S. businessmen visiting France.  To conduct these "bag job" operations,
the French allegedly maintain an extensive network of part-time or volunteer informants known as "honorary correspondents," whose main tasks are to help the DGSE (French Intelligence) gain entry into hotel rooms, delay or distract targets, and provide an early warning system in cases where targets return early... placing electronic eavesdropping equipment on Air France flights between Paris and New York to listen in on traveling U.S. businessmen, attempting to plant moles in European branches of U.S. corporations, and wiretapping state-owned communications lines used by U.S. companies located in France.'
Most interesting for cypherpunks:
An ominous footnote  indicates that:  'While many American companies employ encryption equipment, under French law they must give the "keys" to the French government.  This allows the French Intelligence services to listen to encoded transmissions.'
If anyone wants a fuller summary, I'll post it to the list with enough Moral:  Even a clueless Law Student comments on intelligence better than "In fact, had Bancroft not existed,       potestas scientiae in usu est

Not all agents are agents provocateur.  Human Intelligence is often required to determine if the criteria you cite above are present.
The distinction is in the difference between private and government sponsored espionage and intelligence.
Most of the French activity is, for example, government sponsored.  As is most of the Japanese activity.  U.S. activity is mostly private, by corporations and such.
I believe the numbers above are quite helpful really, in identifying scope, and demonstrating a need for counterespionage.

It's important here to distinguish economic "espionage" and economic
Espionage refers to the stealing of secrets with humint, and genrally the
term economic espionage refers to the actual thefts as with the French
government stealing bids, and bag jobbing American businessmen.
Economic Intelligence is much older, and is more about economic analysis
on a macro scale of the target country.
I mention these because the doublespeak can trip up people who aren't
used to what the intelligence types are saying.
John Deutsch is definately an economic intelligence man, but has in past

"It's a petty program, you should ignore it" is what you're really saying, which completely misses the fact, that millions of people are using/going to use it, and they are as likely to use it for banking as for shopping at home as for 'surfing.'
Then again, perhaps your intent was never to make strong encryption available to the masses.

Were I an overseas employer, I would be quite happy to work in a "disinterested" jurisdiction and hire American workers to telecommute and issue their pay blindly to the number only or crypto bank account of their choice and promptly encrypt or lose the records.
Remember, there is an incentive for employERS as well as employees to flee the tax system of a nation that is manipulative of it.  Employers who work in tax free ways will be able to pay their employees less, quite a bit less.  Given a 32% tax rate, an employer with the advantage of no income reporting on employees will easily be able to drop a given salary 25% and attract employees quite easily.
Who are you going to work for?  The publisher who is based in New York and reports all payments, or the publisher who works in the Cayman Islands, reports nothing, and merely sells the manuscript to the big name publisher in New York after purchasing it blind from you?
I believe it will be extremely hard for VAT inspectors, in future, to determine one of a few things needed to assess VAT taxes.
1> Identity of employers within their jurisdiction
2> Identity of employees within their jurisdiction
3> Who is working "IN" their jurisdiction
4> Who is a U.S. citizen
How can you say that the 2 meg random data file that Mr. X sent to Publishing Company B is worth $2mil?  That the encrypted letter to client Q is the sum of legal work worth $80,000 in services and research?  These are particularly difficult to determine when the bank transaction are made with truely anonymous e-cash and overseas accounts.  It's simply not possible unless:
1>  The state has enforced toy crypto
2>  The strong crypto the parties use is broken
3>  The parties tell.
At some point, the only thing your going to be able to tax is "Goods."  As in solid and measureable.
When this is true, the most profitable venture in the United States will be retail smuggling.  And as taxes are raised again and again, compliance will drop and drop until the largest portion of the national budget will be enforcement of the Value Tax Reform and Retail Laundering and Terrorism Act of 2002.
Again, the more difficult it gets to do business in the United States without taxation far out of proportion to other nation states, the fewer companies will stick around.  I might add that as technology progresses, fewer and fewer companies will NEED to work in the United States.
What I have not discussed here are the various political problems involved.  I admit they exist, but I haven't quite come to a conclusion of how the balance between government self preservation and blind and secure transactions will balance out.  I believe in part it rests on how much the United States will be willing to abide by various constitutional provisions.  Americans are going to have to decide if they really believe in free speech and freedom, a question which has begun to surface quite obviously of late.
It will literally take a dictatorship to enforce taxation in any real way in 15 years, if not sooner.  VAT, income, sales tax, or otherwise.

You also might point out that commercial escrow is in a way MORE prone to compromise because it effectively doubles the number of entities entitled to demand release of the keys.
Instead of JUST government, you now have to face the possibility of key forfeiture by BOTH government and the commercial escrow agent, the escrow agent being, as it is, subject to the whim of governmental coercion to release keys as well as the agent's own reasons for doing so.
Effectively the potential for misuse is increased by virtue of the increased numbers of officals (commercial and public) who have access to the material.
I would like to hear the answer to this dilemna, which I am sure will include something about commercial key escrow easing the perceptions of the public, to which the obvious response will be, "Then this is a public relations move to avoid the perception of potential government abuse and a move which infact increases the level of risk, is that right?"
Perhaps I should attend.  Where and when is this precisely?

My pleasure.
"Race to the bottom" this is usually called by statists who dislike the effect.  It's also applied to things like environmental regulation, where (for example) many businesses in Illinois moved to Indiana when it became clear that Indiana was much more corporate friendly because their 'office paper' disposal "tax" was zero, and Illinois was significant enough to make small business feel the pressure.  (No, I'm not kidding)  Of course, losing the business, Illinois uped the ante and eliminated the tax all together and coupled it with some kind of incentive.  Indiana countered and so forth.  Everyone won, of course, in that the total number of small businesses in both states outgrew economic growth over the period, but the leftists had a fit.  Wealth maximization is not a concept that is easily understoof by greedy statists who want MORE and want it NOW.  I am amused that this strata of market forces is never recognized as market forces, but just dirty nasty states shooting important regulation down.

You need to think real hard about how likely foreign customers on a scale as large as the U.S. government are going to be attracted to a product that forfeits its keys to the U.S. government.  Consider this problem again in light of all the hand waving about the U.S. intelligence agencies and industrial espionage/intelligence.
And most of those laws apply only to other members of the market, not "public safety" announcements by private or not-for-profit organizations.
It infuriates me to turn this into a question of hand wringing over exactly HOW to say that your keys will be turned over to the nearest government agency and that the product, from a security standpoint, is simply unacceptable.  I suppose we could call it "security challenged" but I think that a bit silly, don't you?
Then again, we wouldn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
If you can't say anything nice, then key forfeiture obviously sucks.
Let's put this example in a more personal context, with you as the netscape guru.  In fact, let us carry that assumption along, as really I'm talking to the netscape insiders to begin with.
It's silly or unrealistic only because your views on the subject are obviously worth less than the salary cut you would take for quitting.  In fact, the fact that it is silly or unreasonable at all for you to resign is totally based on your assessment of what the spread of strong crypto and the opposition to key forfeiture is worth.  You have made that decision, but don't call hopeful prodding unrealistic unless you include the statement 'key forfeiture is simply not worth enough for me to endure the risk and likely salary cut I will have to face if I oppose it strongly.'
Your faith in Joe Random vastly exceeds mine.
And one less now that Netscape has taken this position, yes.  Shuffling the blame off on everyone else is a fine thing to do unless you are sitting on top of a hunk of cash, a lot of influence, and a foot into the market.  You have the chance here to do a lot of good, rather than cave in and suckle off the teat of your local authority figure.  Then again, your money is in your pocket, and we have well estlablished exactly what strong crypto is worth to you.
Again, your faith in Joe Random is excessive.  NETSCAPE has a position of power at the moment, and could easily energize the issue and educate a lot more stockholders by taking a stand than by caving in.  If your concern is education, netscape press releases and political positions are much more potent in that regard than cypherpunks mailing lists.
Your information cost is lower by a factor of 100 or more.  Putting the burden on our shoulders, and then couching it in terms of the cypherpunks being negative, when indeed we are merely pointing out to whoever will listen that a spineless money decision has been made, is the center of hyprocracy.  It sickens me.
As does this psycho-babble trash.
So when pinto's explode, I might as well just advertize hondas as a 'better value' and not mention the rather glaring fault in the competing I might add, few cypherpunks (to their great credit) sell their software.  We are interested in the software being the strongest, and best quality.
Freeware has that effect, it clairifies the issue.  No longer is hype or advertizing an issue.  It is merely quality, and peer review, elements which Netscape has completely missed the target (and the barn) on from the beginning.
You mean to realize that Netscape could care less about the 'educated' consumer who is displeased with the decision, and instead is following that large nose which sniffs the waifting scent of green?
Look, I am as much for free market as anyone else.  That's fine.  Don't, however, tell anyone not to complain because this or that company is only in it for the money.  Some people vote with their feet.
I sold the lot of my netscape shares.  I did just fine, and I will sleep better at night.  SOME cypherpunks do buy stock.  Some of us put a great deal of money into the market in fact.  Some of us are interested in promoting companies that further our LONG term interests as well as short term interests.  If you would happen to look at the long term, you might discover that there is more money in it for Netscape, and everyone else, if strong crypto is not restricted.  Unfortuantely, like most Joe Randoms, and most Joe Random Inc.'s, long term for you is when the restricted sell of your stock options expire.
Either support GAK or do not.  Don't give us horseshit about how you think we are being too hard on Netscape because we are educated consumers, and because we realize that GAK crypto is not the best product it could be.
It is as much our right to gripe and moan about the spineless decision as it is for you to make it.  To tell us to ignore it is hypocritical in the extreme.  If your product is so superior, why the hell should you care about a few cypherpunks moaning about this or that?  Aren't we members of the free market as well?  Who are you to tell us that our decision to promote or to denounce netscape is based on the wrong criteria?  The entire point of the free market is to hear and support those concerns in the proportionate levels and with the respective influences that they wield.
Take your emotional censorship elsewhere.  And while your at it, try making a superior product to please us, rather than some high-school textbook psycho-babble about saying only nice things to the other children in the sandbox.

An individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in the encryption numbers in his GAK browser, we reasoned, because he voluntarily conveyed those numbers to the government when he purchased the software.
I would say the above indicates that infact a lot more than common sense is needed to try and assure privacy.  It would seem that when it comes to privacy, you have to be a phone techie or in this case, a crypto techie, to expect to be protected.
In fact it would seem that there is almost a burden imposed on the user to determine who and what gets the information of the software should he or she want to be protected by the constitution.
Actually, I was under the impression that adherance contracts like that (the most oft touted example is the ski lift ticket with four paragraphs on the back) are often tossed out when it has to do with liability on that order.  The reason loan agreements are not often thrown out is because courts find an increased expectation that the consumer would be paying attention to the back of loan documents than the back of a ski lift ticket.  I think it will be unlikely that warnings on the box of a given piece of software will suffice.  Large banners in the program itself may meet the threshold.
If there is enough interest, I will research the threshold issue.

So you will refuse to implement GAK in future version of netscape then?  Or you will merely do lipservice to the GAK policies at the conference?
I think the distinction is quite key.
Forgive the pun.

AT&T seems to have been suitably 'incentivized'
The receipt of government funding (in whatever guise) might be just as powerful in this case.
To the outsider, it looks as if Netscape 'owes' the government.
And this is impressive.  Stamina, however, is much more difficult.
With which firm?  Or have you made it an in-house effort?

"Gee, I dunno, that sounds like a lot of work, and well, I'm making good dough.  Sure, it would be a boon for the company, and fit right in with the mainstream perception that government way too involved in Joe Random's life, and win or lose, either way it would be a major public relations coup, and would restore the confidence of many foreign customers concerned about U.S. economic intelligence goals, but well... it just sounds so... subversive.
Honey, could you pass the jam?"

The point that should have come across was that it is hyprocracy for the Netscape employee to proport to be a strong crypto supporter of any great degree when the phrase 'the money is more important to me' could be applied.
I tend to agree that the resulting effect was instead a version of "if your not a part of the solution, you're part of the problem."
I just get sick of those who tout themselves as Experts in Software Munitions and are in fact are merely in it for the cash.  In it for the cash is just fine.  Just don't tell me later you aren't.
I don't care if Netscape makes a pile of money as of now.  Until they show themselves as a company with backbone in the area I consider important, my investment dollar goes elsewhere.
I believe you got it with:
"If the law requires GAK, then I believe that we will implement it rather
than just disable encryption."
Note that the phrase is entirely ambigious on whether this refers to the law requiring GAK for export, or export AND domestic sales.  Netscape will install GAK into whatever will increase its sales.  I understand and respect this position in the context of a company which needs badly to start raking in some profits.  The title "Software Munitions Expert" or similar such should probably be changed to "GAK marketing expert" however.

While I suspected this, I don't think we needed it to show us how much they really care.  It seems fairly obvious from the outset.
