for requirements that encryption systems and signature verification

@_subject: Chaing Remailers (instructions) [long] 
Note-1: [RRT- stands for Request-Remailing-To:, most remailers also
         accept Anon-To: ]
Note-2: [You is in this doc me          substitute that adress for your own if you          want to receive the test message yourself]
First you should test only one remailer:
you > remailer 1 >> RRT- you
This is what you send:
This is what you receive from alumni.caltech.edu:
If this is succesful you add another remailer:
you > remailer 1 >> RRT- remailer 2 >>> RRT- you
This is what you send:
        Remailer usura will receive this message from
        hal
-->        Because the message has the header pasting tokens [::]     the remailer at xs4all.nl knows where to send it to.
        You will receive this message from xs4all.nl
-->        You can keep adding remailers this way, everytime you receive
a test message back you add another remailer: if you stop receiving
test messages, the last remailer added is most likely "down". You can
check that by using that remailer directly.
The above is simple unencrypted remailing. If you want to have an
encrypted chained remailing, you first have to "design" the chain.
    0] from your PC send to alumni.caltech.edu
    1] at alumni.caltech.edu RRT jpunix.com
    2] at jpunix.com RRT vox.hacktic.nl
    3] at vox.hacktic.nl RRT me
{Stage 3:} This is actually the first message you make. The above is encrypted with the PGPpubKEY of vox.hacktic.nl and will
result in this:
*************************************************    Then you than proceed to the 2nd stage the message wich has to leave
jpunix.com, so remail knows what to do [decrypt it] is:
{Stage 2:}
But jpunix.com has to know where to send it to, so the 2nd stage msg is:
The above is then encrypted with the PGPpubKEY of jpunix.com
{Stage 1:}
This new encrypted message gets the headers for caltech to remail:
{Stage 0:} the message you send to alumni.caltech.edu
is the encrypted message [with the PGPpubKEY of alumni.caltech.edu] of
stage 1 plus a Encrypted: PGP header.
This you send from your PC to hal :
  ^   ^   ^
   |   |
   |   -> the inner envelope: you close this first
   |
   -> the second envelope: you close this second
  -> the outer envelope: this one you close last
If you finger remailer.help.all you will
receive a list of active remailers and their peculiarities.
If you finger remailer-list and/or
              remailer-list you will
              receive a list of uptime statistics. Hope this helps.
Happy Remailing ...

: : I heartily agree with Duncan here! There has been very little said by
: the good residents of France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Italy, etc.
: about just what the crypto-related laws of their countries are.
: So, I appreciate that some of our European readers may be tired of
: hearing about U.S. policy or proposed laws, but the proper solution is
: _competing speech_. That is, give us something new to talk about. Tell
: us about what *your* country is doing. Tell us about any laws limiting
: what kind of modems can be hooked up to your PTTs, as a concrete
: example. Tell us about the raids on BBSs in Italy. Tell us about the
: rumor that the Netherlands plans to ban unapproved crypto. There was a draft for a proposal for a law that would have outlawed crypto in the Netherlands. It would only be legal to use crypto if you had deposited the KEYs and if you had received a license. The use, trade and possesion of crypto was forbidden.
It would be illegal (to dutch law) to have cryptosoftware available at some ftp-site (somewhere in the world) that would be accesable from the Netherlands (really!). (laws and enforcement of those laws are two -totally- different things in Holland :))
The draft was revoked, due to the huge amount of protest',
the good thing is that we are in the proces of founding the
dutch equivelant of the EFF: "de db.nl".
Some loose thoughts any comments ?
There are basicly four scenario's that a state can follow to
regulate crypto:
 - outlaw it totally
This was the path Holland choose briefly.  - key depositing
This is what the US is trying to do with Clipper et al.  - try to develop a standart
This is what the US did with DES and is trying to do
now with Clipper.  - do nothing
The most prosperous scenario. Crypto use will boom, but
lawenforcement agencies will be deprived from a useful
tool, they can't bug phones any more. That will hinder their investigations but advancements in hardware/software  could balance that: it is more easy to localise phonecalls,
bugging equipment has become smaller and more powerful.
Lawenforcement agencies have computerised databases that can link fingerprints, names etc in near "real-time". Large scale
use of crypto could balance out some of the recent advancements
in information technology that have given them a clear edge.

: : Last time I checked (a week ago, I am currently on the road) there : well over 500 or 600 active ecash accounts. But there are another : 1000 accounts waiting, and new requests coming in between 10 and 100 : per day. :               Because we can not support a 24 hour staff and we want : to keep response time low, people in time zones close to ours (GMT+1) : have been issued accounts first. At the moment we are confident we can : scale up the trial. I promise you it will not be several more months : before everyone can join the trial.
There is a sort of (limited) Freenet system in Holland called DDS, people can request an account, (wich usually takes 48 hours), if youre
- -really- want ECash fast, get an Dutch-English dictionary and type:
