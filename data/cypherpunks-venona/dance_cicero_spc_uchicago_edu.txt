No.  The object of government is to limit the freedom of the people it
governs.  The word is derived from "govern" which means "3. To control the
actions or behavior of  4. To keep under control; *restrain*" [American
Heritage Dict.]
It would be great if government could be a service provider, or simply feel
responsible for those it governs--but then it would not be a government any
It would also be nice if I won the lotto. ;)

Well, as a tribalist, I don't agree that this "useful service" is
ultimately necessary.  I *do* agree, however, that government is necessary
*at the moment.*  As a species we have not evolved enough to learn to take
personal responsibility for our actions, therefore an external restraint
system is necessary.  My particular slant on anarchy calls for personal
responsibility, which I believe renders an external system of
superintendence unnecessary. But as I said before, this species isn't
I would rather have Customer Service than government, but I don't believe I
can have both.
Write me some more and hear my other stupid ideas. ;)

_Ender's Game_ you say?  Hmm.  I simply assumed that we had a plethora of
Diogeneses because Diogenes was a kick-ass Cynic.
This has *nothing* to do with cipher. Cynicpunks anyone?  Hmm.

@_subject: EFF Analysis of Leahy/Edwards Digital Telephony Bill 
I hope this is helpful (and not too out-of-date, 9 days ago!). It's the
EFF's justification....
A telecommunications carrier is required to ensure that, within four years
from the date of enactment, it has the capability to:
1.      expeditiously isolate the content of a targeted communication
        within its service area;
2.      isolate call-identifying information about the origin and
        destination of a targeted communication;
3.      enable the government to access isolated communications at a point away
        from the carrier's premises and on facilities procured by the
        government, and;
4.      to do so unobtrusively and in such a way that protects the privacy and
        security of communications not authorized to be intercepted (Sec.
        2601).
However, the bill does not permit law enforcement agencies or officers to
require the specific design of features or services, nor does it prohibit a
carrier from deploying any feature or service which does not meet the
requirements outlined above.
CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS
Within 1 year of enactment of the bill, the Attorney General must
determine the maximum number of intercepts, pen register, and trap and
trace devices that law enforcement will require four years from the date of
enactment.  Notices of capacity requirements must be published in the
Federal Register (Sec. 2603).   Carriers have 4 years to comply with
capacity requirements.
