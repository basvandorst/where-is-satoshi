From The New York Times, June 28, 1994, pages D1, D5:
"Profit and Ego in Data Secrecy" [headline].
By John Markoff.  Special to The New York Times.
REDWOOD CITY, Calif., June 27 --
If the web of thousands of computer networks around the world be thought of as an information superhighway, then Jim Bidzos one of its best-placed toll takers.  Mr. Bidzos expects to very rich -- unless the Government has its way.
As president of a Silicon Valley company called RSA Data Security Inc., Mr. Bidzos,
39, controls the patents for software crucial to scrambling and unscrambling computer
messages so they can be sent confidentially.
Just about anyone using a computer network -- whether for sending personal
messages, filing taxes electronically, or shopping from home with a credit card --
would want such confidentiality.
On the strength of its coding technology, RSA has sold more than four million copies
of its software, and it has won wide support from industry giants like Apple Computer,
I.B.M., Lotus Development, Microsoft, Motorola, Northern Telecom, Novell and Sun
Not Just for Spies Anymore [subhead]
Until recently cryptography, the science of sending secret messages, was a province
generally populated by the armed forces, governments and their spies.  But with the
rise of commercial computer networks, cryptography has become an essential
ingredient in information-age services.
RSA's software is based on an innovation in cryptography that permits people to
exchange private messages without actually getting together beforehand and
arranging a secret password.  In the past, cryptography required that two parties to a
communication first meet to exchange a large number that enabled them to encode
and decode messages.
RSA's system employs two keys, one for encoding a message, known as a public key,
and another for decoding it, called a private key.  People who wish to receive secret
messages can freely distribute their public key, which enables senders to encode a
message.  Only with the private key can the message be decoded.
A company selling products on-line, for instance, might make its public key widely
available, which would enable customers to send in a coded message containing their
credit card numbers that could not be intercepted and read by others.  The company
could decode those messages with its private key, which has a relationship to the public one.
The Government fears that should the RSA system become available abroad, it would
lose its ability to eavesdrop and wiretap in cases involving risks to national security.  It
would much prefer that the global standard be based on its own Clipper encryption
standard, which has a "backdooor" that law enforcement officials can peek through.
Precisely because the RSA method has no backdoor, it is the choice of industry.
But to some government officials, Mr. Bidzos is nothing short of a scheming
"The Government would like him to not exist," said Jeffrey I. Schiller, computer
manager at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has negotiated a licensing
deal with Mr. Bidzos.
And Stuart Baker, who until several weeks ago was chief counsel of the National
Security Agency, observed, "My sense is that his motivation is no more than trying to
convince people to buy his products."
Officials at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, another Federal
agency, say they want to create a standard that is not beholden to the patents of one
small company.  And the National Security Agency and the Justice Department want a
standard that will allow law enforcement agencies to eavesdrop on suspected
criminals or violators of national security.
Conventional Wisdom [subhead]
From Mr. Bidzos's perspective, Washington remains bound up in a cold war mentality,
and should simply get out of the way and let RSA Data go about its business.  What
is more, he complains, any number of foreign companies are developing encryption
techniques just as hard to crack as his, so the Government's efforts to keep him from
exporting his software is useless, and perhaps Notwithstanding the official concerns, RSA has developed a loyal following among a
wide range of computer, communications and software companies.  "They have the
strongest technology and the best reputation in the cryptography business," said
William Ferguson, vice president of Semaphore, Inc., a maker of systems that licenses RSA's software.
Adding spice to this dispute is Mr. Bidzos's ability to outmaneuver the Government,
most recently by snatching a crucial patent from under the noses of officials who were
planning to use it in an official standard they are trying to Several years ago, two top computer scientists from the National Institute of Standards
and Technology traveled to Europe to meet with a German mathematician, Claus
Schnorr, who holds a key patent that the Government's coding system may violate.
When they returned to the United States, the scientists told their superiors that the
United States should license Mr. Schnorr's patent.  But Washington was slow to act.
So in March 1993, while Mr. Bidzos was on a trip to France, he met with Mr. Schnorr
for a four-hour lunch.  By the end of the meal, Mr. Bidzos had a deal to use Mr.
Schnorr's patent.
Despite Mr. Bidzos's high profile in the world of encryption, RSA's revenue is small --
somewhere between $5 million and $10 million annually.  But analysts say that the
company has the ability to grow substantially.
"They have huge opportunity in the Internet," said Lisa Thorell, a researcher at
Dataquest in San Jose, Calif., referring to the global web of computer networks that is
regarded as a working but primitive model of a global data RSA is also playing an increasing role in the $500 million business for equipment that permits safe financial trasnactions and voice and data
A Question of Patents [subhead]
The issue clouding the future of the company is how severely it will suffer from export
controls and competing standards backed by the National Security Agency.  Last
month the Government made its own competing standard for signing electronic
documents mandatory for all Federal agencies, and declared that the digital signature
standard, as it is known, did not violate RSA's technology.
Mr. Bidzos thinks that Washington is infringing his patents, and, eventually, the
strength of his patent claims will be tested in court.  Rather then (sic) sue the
Government, Mr. Bidzos is likely to start with one of the small companies, like Group
Technologies Corporation, in Tampa, that is making components under a Government
contract, industry executives say.
Mr. Bidzos, who is a Greek citizen and a permanent resident of the United States, was
working at a small international marketing firm in 1985 when he decided to move from
Florida to the Silicon Valley to help a friend save a failing "I wanted to do deals and stay in luxury hotels," he said recently at his office here.  "I
had no idea I'd be in the center of a political whirlwind."
When Mr. Bidzos joined the company in 1986, RSA was shoestring operation about to
go into bankruptcy.  With his help, RSA struck a deal with Lotus Development in 1987,
in which the software giant agreed to advance money for the right to include RSA
software in Lotus Notes, a program designed for work groups of office employees.
A year later RSA was presented with an offer to be acquired by Rupert Murdoch in a
multimillion-dollar deal.  A Murdoch subsidiary, the News Data Corporation, was developing technology for Mr. Murdoch's Sky TV.  So in 1988 Mr.
Bidzos flew twice to Britain to attempt to negotiate a deal, but the sides were far apart
on price.
He says the offers to buy RSA still roll in.  "I've received no less than five firm, written
offers in the last two years," he said.
He also says he doesn't think that the Government can regain the upper hand in the
cryptography wars.
"They've fired every weapon they have at us now, and we're stronger than ever," Mr.
Bidzos said.  "All they can do is try to get RSA legislated out of business, and that will
never happen, in my

Forwarding message by gtoal
Several years ago lots of British scientists died under mysterious  circumstances.  They were generally described as 'defence scientists'  but what a significant number of them had in common was work in  the area of surveillance.  Several of them were connected to UK's  system X.  I posted a long piece at the time (now lost, sorry)  hypothesising that what was going on was internecine warfare betweem  the UK and USA governments departments responsible for fitting  surveillance assistance to their telephone exchanges for contracts  with foreign countries.  (One UK govt official was found dead in  his hotel room in an arab country while there at a trade fair in  an unofficial capacity helping to promotye system X).  At that time  the UK govt had a clear lead in selling bugged exchanges because complete surveillance capability was designed in to system X -  the USA doesn't have it everywhere yet - just in exchanges from  co-operative suppliers. (Hence the 'wiretap' FBI bill, to get  everyone else to play ball too).  The ability to remotely monitor  all the phone system of a foreign country would be *extremely*  valuable to an agency like the CIA or GCHQ.  Personally I don't  doubt it's worth killing for, in their view.
It was also my view when I suggested this hypothesis some years  ago that the phone systems were being sold to these countries by  telling the respective governments that *they* could use them for  surveillance purposes.  My suspicion was that there would be extra  code buried in the switches that the customers did not know about  which would enable remote callers to use the surveillance options  too, without the host country or telco being aware of them. This  latter capability being top secret and the risk of it being made  known by disaffected employees perhaps being the reason why some  of them were killed by our own security agencies.  Hence why the  multiple suspicious deaths were never properly investigated (or at  least the investigations made public - MI5 couldn't expose the USA  dirty tricks without exposing their own.)
This is all highly speculative and I don't stand by it, I just  offer it as a hypothesis.

Forwarding message by scmayo
Organization: Australian National University
The question in the subject of this thread may seem dumb to some people  in this group, but I'm curious about how varied the motivations  of  crypto-using people are.
I got PGP running on my machine a few weeks ago because I liked the  idea of being able to communicate privately if I wanted, as I felt  that email was much more insecure than other forms of communication.  I started reading some of the crypto stuff on WWW and noticed a political trend in the motivations of many of the people who are 'big' in the crypto scene in the US. The motivation for these people's interest in  cryptography seems to stem from a strong libertarian viewpoint, which  incidentally often seems to coincide with strong views about the right to bear arms. It may seem that I am being particularly naive in being  surprised by this but I am from the UK where libertarian views of this  kind are not so widely held. I have never held a hand gun and have no desire to do so. Similarly my motivations for using cryptography come simply from a desire for privacy from Govt. and other snooping but NOT  from the 'cyber-survivalist' inclinations that seem to motivate some in  the US at least. I read some stuff on Vince Cate's WWW site by Tim May about how crypto was going to bring down governments due to (legal?) tax evasion by those who are computer literate . I have to say that I think this is highly unlikely (and to be fair, Vince's site included an article by Hal Finney agreeing with my view). I know that Tim May's views are considered to  be extreme by some, but more moderate people seem to hold the view that crypto and also cyberspace (god I hate these buzzwords) in general herald an age of 'survival of the fittest' where those clued up about computers will be able to take advantage and do better due to paying less taxes  etc.
Personally I have no desire to evade tax since I quite like being able  to drive on tarmac without holes, and having schooling and health care  provided for all with the richer folk subsidising the poorer folk. I  realise my views are anathema to the libertarian and I'm curious to know  if there are other crypto users (I would NEVER call myself a cypherpunk :-)  who's interest stems from a left-wing rather than right-wing viewpoint.  I should point out that I consider tha libertarian/crypto-anarchist views  I've outlined above to be an extreme form of the (right-wing) philosphy of individualism. I'd never come across a right-wing anarchist before reading the crypto groups - weird!

It parallels political and economic chance and the use of crypto to hide info from foes and competitors.

I would say that an algorithm is also a rigidly constructed framework consisting of well-defined formula within a stabilized potential well; as such it has limited operability in situations which possess fuzzy heuristics - such situations would include ordinary-language parsing, by the way, if a theoretical full-accountability is to be given. Eliminating indeterminacy and `true randomness' is eliminating the lifeworld itself, with its fuzzy heuristics not always reducible to natural law, even of the trajectory-bundles of chaos theory. So we are thrown back to a quantum computer which is reduced in the quoted text as well to a theoretical positioning; this is suspect since such a computer also functions in the lifeworld. If the brain in Penrose's text functions as _a_ quantum com- puter, what is the source of the singularity (_a_)? It seems to me that there is, in the real, deep fuzziness all the way around. Are we dealing with a group of logicians who have ignored Schutz? I think so,

*  As the single largest purchaser of desktop computer systems, the government could then decree that it will never buy another computer system with principal interfaces that do not conform to these standards.  This would send an unmistakable message that open standards are the key to a free market.  This point is especially critical to guaranteeing that the information superhighway allows competition, innovation and choice.

Responding to msg by a.brown (Andrew Brown) on Wed, 3 Aug  1:17 PM
Features for concealment of plain or cyphertext by CAD 1.  Plain or cyphertext can be imported by each letter, by sentence, by block of text; then manipulated by the CAD program as one or multiple concealed CAD entities.
2.  Text manipulation includes:
    Reduce to any scale.
    Place on hidden layers.
    Hide by other entities.
    Distort to a variety of shapes.
    And otherwise disfigure the text into non-recognizable 3.  In addition, there are a host of CAD-features for further, multiple, transformations of the text, including algorithmic 4.  Subsequent manipulation of the CAD document may include exporting to other proprietary and generic CAD formats.
5.  CAD document may then be transmitted plain (in the selected CAD format) or encrypted for transmission.
6.  The recipient uses a CAD program (and decryption program if needed) to restore the concealed text to its original encrypted form.  It is exported to the original encryption program for decryption. 7.  Caveat 1:  While this manipulation will be invisible or camouflaged in the CAD document the underlying code of the program will provide clues.  However, it should be possible to encrypt these clues.
8.  Caveat 2:  Sender and recipient will need to exchange protocols, by encrypted transmission probably, for restoring the concealed text.
9.  Caveat 3:  This is not elegant and requires little or no crypto competency.  But it can be easily done by a CAD operator to help conceal sophisticated crypto.

The list Cyberia posted an article yesterday on the US Postal Service's plan to use a public key system for email. If anyone wants the full posting, email me; it's about 25K.
Below are excerpts:
Quebec City, Canada, August 3, 1994--The U.S. Postal Service dramatically increased its commitment to the security of
communications on the NII, with the announcement of Postal
Electronic Commerce Services ("Postal ECS"), which will offer a
nationwide public key certification service for the of digital signatures used in paperless electronic commerce.   Richard Rothwell, Senior Director of Technology Integration for USPS, officially released the news today in Quebec City, in a delivered to an international working group of the Information
Security Committee of the American Bar Association's Section of
Science and Technology, which has been developing guidelines public key certification authorities. [Speech is all in uppercase]
* * *
AS MANY EXPERTS HAVE NOTED, INCLUDING MANY OF YOU IN THIS
ROOM, DIGITAL FILES AS A RULE ARE NEITHER AS SECURE NOR AS
ELECTRONIC COMMERCE CONVEYS.  BUT WITHOUT SOME METHOD OF A DIGITAL FILE TO ESTABLISH ITS CONTENTS, AUTHOR, AND TIME OF
TRANSMITTAL, THE BENEFITS OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE WILL BE LIMITED TO HIGHLY STRUCTURED TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN PARTIES KNOW AND TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
* * *
THE POSTAL SERVICE IS USING PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY, RELATED TECHNOLOGIES, TO DEVELOP A PUBLIC KEY CERTIFICATION
AUTHORITY AND A SET OF ASSOCIATED TRUSTED THIRD PARTY SERVICES
WHICH WE CALL POSTAL ELECTRONIC COMMERCE SERVICES (POSTAL ECS). WHEN INITIALLY DEPLOYED, POSTAL ECS WILL PROVIDE A BASIS FOR
ELECTRONIC ASSURANCES WITHIN AND AMONG GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND
BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS.  IN
PARTICULAR, THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS DEVELOPED THE ABILITY TO:
    ISSUE PUBLIC KEY CERTIFICATES AND STORE THEM IN A
          PUBLIC DIRECTORY;     PROVIDE FOR THE "SEALING" OF SELECTED DOCUMENTS OR
          OTHER ELECTRONIC OBJECTS AND ASSOCIATING THEM WITH A
          DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND A TRUSTED TIME AND DATE STAMP;
    PROVIDE SERVICES FOR PUBLIC KEY CERTIFICATE           AND REVOCATION; AND,     PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO ENCRYPT CONFIDENTIAL           MOVING BETWEEN THE USER ENVIRONMENT AND THE POSTAL           MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
    FINALLY, PROVIDE NEAR REAL-TIME ACCESS TO           AND THEIR STATUS.
THE CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY WILL ISSUE AND MANAGE X.509 PUBLIC
KEY CERTIFICATES CONTAINING A PERSON'S X.500 DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC KEY, AND OTHER IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.  USERS CAN THEN
RETRIEVE A CERTIFICATE FROM THE POSTAL SERVICE, AND USE ITS
PUBLIC KEY TO AUTHENTICATE A DIGITAL SIGNATURE GENERATED BY THE
COMPLEMENTARY PRIVATE KEY.  * * *
THESE USER AGENTS CONTAIN STANDARD PROGRAMMING INTERFACES THAT
LINK USER APPLICATIONS, CRYPTOGRAPHIC ROUTINES, AND ECS TOGETHER.  OUR INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION IS BASED ON THE DIGITAL
SIGNATURE STANDARD (DSS) ALGORITHM SET; BUT OUR PLAN IS TO
SUPPORT OTHER CRYPTOGRAPHIC OPTIONS SUCH AS RSA IN THE NEAR
FUTURE. * * *
IN KEEPING WITH THE PHILOSOPHY I HAVE ARTICULATED, LET ME SAY
THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE, IN ANY DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PRODUCTS,
INTENDS TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE CRYPTOGRAPHIC PRODUCTS IN THE PLACE.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL NOT COMPETE WITH NETWORK SERVICE
PROVIDERS, NOR WILL WE BECOME A NETWORK OR CARRIER.

A small note:  The NY Times article today said that NSA will contribute $4.2 million toward *development*, along with $400,000 in software-consulting services, while Cray will invest another $4.8 million.  Thus the overall cost, after full development, may be more than you assumed in your calculations and thus the power may be more.
But, as the story said, Cray will need more than this initial contract to survive, so the machine may never be completed.

Bill's suggestion about obscurity through strong crypto as a defense against real bullets is a provocative version of "the pen is mightier than the sword" homily.
That rephrasing of the topic seems to be a good way to mix software and hardware issues that originated the "they" topic.
Is it possible for mind stuff and its gadgets to beat the tools of physical violence?  It seems that is what this list is Jim Dixon's elegant disquisition (and that of other respondents) on the rise and fall of governments is less persuasive than his (and others') remarks, say, on the NSA spy machine where he (and they) shows nitty-gritty expertise.
I vote for the nit-grit as more pertinent to Hal's "real bullets" problem.  Sorry, but geo-political bullshit apologizes for real killers of all political bent, in power or out.
Geo-pol is overdone by talking heads who sound numbingly alike.  The distincitive sound of crypto and techno stuff is what charms here, because it's rarely heard in public venues.

2.  Who is in the offing to succeed Cray and others as NSA's grateful suppliers?
3.  Will there be more on-base hardware and software production, a "circling of the wagons" as crypto becomes more 4.  And, thus, an even sharper (and more secret and competitive) line between governmental and commercial crypto hardware and code?
5.  Who is NSA (or other TLAs) underwriting as lesser known SRCs, not-for- or for-profit?  This is an update on where the jobs are for the "finest mathematicians" other than TLAs.
6.  Is NSA (like CIA and NRO) bifurcating into an even more super-supersecret arm and another friendly, public one in response to wider use of crypto and ostensible pressure from the likes of Senators Moynihan and Kerrey?  (And the recent RSA to-dos, murder threat, PKP lawsuit, are ploys.)

Hey, that's what commercializing the national security treasure is all about.
Ignorance is essential for the market in nuclear "terrorism".  The staid NY Times headlined a summary of this topic with "Call 1-800-TERROR".  The unknown threat is the weapon.  Intelligence is the magic shield.
The National Resources Defense Council pointed out in an execellent series on nuclear weapons a few years back that it is impossible to make an accurate count of nuclear devices because every country dissembles even while leaking data to sow fear.  Even now, says NRDC, the need is for a reliable way to count so the fictitious can be separated from the real.
Lack of precision, ignorance, thank you Perry, helps market fake as well as real nuclear material, just like any other market-driven exotic product (supercomputers?).  Recent reports describe the Russian nuclear materials managers proffering their real and Potemkin cache for buy-out to the most gullible deep-pockets, governments.
And so goes pumping this lucrative market, and its concomitant market of intelligence, now commercial where once affairs of state.  More national security legislation, more powerful computers, more money for salesmen (er, agents).
Ignorance drives this market, always has; starting some forty years ago with George Kennan's lurid 'X' essay on containment.  Jim Dixon, help out with gritty facts.

Under a sub-sub-sub-contract I once worked on some phony CAD drawings for the nuclear weapons production process, plotting false info that still appears in popular books, some of which has been posted here.
The docs were then encrypted and stegonagraphied for authenticity.  We were told that they were turned loose on the market for this product in other countries.
I don't know if the USG was involved, there no security clearances.  It may have been a commercial scam.
Also, growing up not to far from LANL, I was told that kids of staff were encouraged to chat about B-this  and W-that by the security people there as part of the fog around that outfit.
This supports the suggestion for profligate use of PGP as a stratagem, to make it harder to tell the trivial from the Or is public encryption a stratagem to focus on software rather than hardware?
Anybody hear anything about covert ID in new-generation CPUs, like done with supercomps?

Out of your several thoughful comments this one strikes some Terror of nuclear weapons is universal.  Nothing about crypto anarchy is terrifying (yet).
A link between the two is not fanciful because of the challenge to those who hold secrets posed by crypto anarchy.
One singularity of the nuclear arsenal was that few people actually know its capability.  Its secrecy is a part of the threat.  The same is true of the more general national security apparatus, most of whose power derives from privileged knowledge of weapon-systems capabilities.
By extension of state power, under the rubric of national security, to other areas of government, often under the guise of intelligence and law enforcement needs, we have a society where a small number of economic, scientific, political, military and law enforcement persons hold privileged secrets and a very large citizenry who does not.  Because of suspected abuse of privilege, these keepers of secrets are no longer Electoral politics, once thought to offer means to throw the scoundrels out, now feeds this suspicion, rather than relieving it,  because little of entrenched power structures are changed by the voting process.  The public process merely cosmetizes the means for exploiting the the secret privileges of the few.
The crypto and related technological and civil issues discussed on this list might be viewed as exploring how to redirect the science and technology, heretofore used sustain a national security-driven economy, toward creating the apparatus for a more just and benefical civil society, one less fraught with military, police and economic insecurity and fear of the tools of privileged secrecy.
Mastering cryptography and devising ways to put it to remunerative use are honorable and constructive alternatives to enduring unresponsive government.  If successful they will set examples, and provide tools,  for others to diminish state However, there is still the task of proving that crypto anarchy is not itself a play for power by those who write and master its cryptographic code.  But better to test that in the public arena rather remain hidden and protected by state secrecy.
Fierce opposition should be expected, not least by demonizing crypto anarchy.  It will probably begin within the crypto anarchy enterprise under the guise of skeptical criticism and provocative baiting.
It is worth recalling that classical black anarchy, the secret, lethal version as distinguished from open black flag type, is used by despots to justify their ruthless measures.  Black anarchists, as agents of despots,  mingle with avowed flag-wavers to spy and provoke acts that lead to repressive crackdowns.  Black anarchists never announce themselves as such but may freely admit to being "anarchistic" as a wild-eyed subterfuge.  Inept provocations sometimes reveal them but the most able are never detected.

Some folks in other countries of more afraid of the USG and national security capitalism (protection of "national interest") than some of us are.  They view it as normal that the Government will advance and protect interests of its economy, including, if necessary, by military force.
Those who have lived abroad know that fear of our foreign policy is greater than the US public may want to believe.  Our domestic-oriented politics clouds understanding of the effects of what is perceived to be aggression against the sovereignty of other nations' culture.
Other countries' drive for nuclear weapons, or alliances with those who have nuclear capabilities, is based what they think is a "real politik" necessity to the loss of being able to balance the Soviets against the US.
China, as the most obvious example, is working this fear-of-the-west hard to gain support in Asia and the Middle East for its nuclear program.

Sound remarks about domestic upheavals.
Parallel to these, it should be added that internal strife has declined as US foreign interventions have increased.  From Teddy Roosevelt forward, whenever domestic strain builds, there just happens to be an urgent matter somewhere else that needs patriotic attention to our "national interests".
Soothing, addictive, social and economic bribes flow from warmaking -- industrial growth, jobs, education, research, technological advances.
A bitching citizenry is a happy citizenry where domestic Government affairs are concerned, but the most obedient people are those united against a foreign foe.  Lesson 1 of world affairs leadership.

Yes.  The external threat to the US has diminished, let's hope, to where some resources, human and material, can be applied to ways to make an advanced society serve its citizenry without resorting to fear of foreign boogies.
The way that the surveillance satellite systems of the US and the USSR helped to reduce fear of military planners is instructive.  This non-lethal technology, though expensive, made, and continues to make,  accidental nuclear war less likely, and seems to me to be a great service to the world's Aggressive weapons systems may be similarly replaced by non-lethal technology as scientists and technologists are asked to device such apparatus.
Fear of economic and social deprivation might also benefit from the talents of those who once produced the tools of the Cold War and hot regional conflicts you mention.
Further, this list offers other ways to envision a society less dependent on the national security rubric of big Government, and may thereby support alternative local initiatives for economic and civil affairs.
Kudos for this non-lethal work.

Method and Madness
Nicolas Wade
Little Brother
Not so long ago, high technology was seen as the likely handmaiden of
totalitarian government, with surveillance systems and central tracking  every citizen from cradle to grave. By a strange turn events, what is now in progress is the very opposite of that So many powerful technologies are streaming into private hands Government is struggling to protect even the bare minimum of legitimate domains.
Once only governments could launch photoreconnaissance satellites; now
the C.I A. is anxiously trying to curb commercial systems that discern objects as small as a yard across, high-enough resolution to
interest generals as much as geologists. A fleet of satellites designed to give military commanders their exact anywhere in the world is now in essence available to anyone; Pentagon has let the public listen in on a degraded signal, but
commercial vendors with clever algorithms can restore it to
near-military accuracy.
The computers that tie together the Government's information have become increasingly porous. The better their security systems, the
more tempting the challenge. Earlier this year the Pentagon that a coterie of computer hackers had penetrated large parts of its
sensitive though unclassified computer network and had even control of several military computers.
Think tanks and academics have warned for years, quite erroneously, that
terrorists would avail themselves of nuclear, chemical or weapons; it hasn't happened, because none of these items are easy to use
and simpler means have always been available. But the samples of stolen
Russian uranium and plutonium that have recently been captured Germany are a clear warning that this blithe era of security may now be
The samples seem to have come from reactor fuel and laboratories, not
nuclear warheads. But that is small comfort, especially in view of new
calculations that only one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of plutonium is needed
to make a bomb, not eight kilograms as was generally assumed. And the
smugglers caught by the German police were hawking four kilograms for a
mere $250 million.
Perhaps the most surprising democratization of high technology is that of
cryptography, once an elite art of those who guarded Government's most
precious secrets. The first serious challenge to the National Agency's ability to crack almost everyone else's ciphers came from an
ingenious coding approach created in academe in the mid-1970's and known
as the public key cryptosystem. The commercial sponsor sold the to American companies but was not allowed to export it. Then in 1991, a
Colorado computer expert, Philip R. Zimmermann, produced a apparently based on this system, which he named Pretty Good Privacy. A
copy of Pretty Good Privacy found its way onto the Internet, free to
takers from all countries, and all of a sudden Government-class became available to everyone. Zimmermann's next project is to develop a
pretty secure citizen's phone that scrambles conversations.
At this point, of course, it's possible to wonder if the humiliation of
Big Brother isn't being taken beyond reasonable limits. Some monopolies are not so bad: the use of force, for one. If you believe the
F.B.I. is bugging your conversations, you'll want to see Zimmermann in
the inventors' hall of fame; if terrorism and organized crime seem the
more immediate threats, the universal right to absolute privacy less compelling.
Is it possible for the state to get too weak in relation to its adversaries? That's the last thought that occurs to Americans across a
wide spectrum of opinion, from free market economists to civil
libertarians. From a variety of motives, they persistently call governmental power to be curbed. The present headlong democratization of
high technology is the flower of a decade of economic deregulation, and
of the fading influence of military procurement as a driver of The state is so familiar a political structure that its endurance is
hard to doubt. For economists and political analysts, it is the unit of account. Yet in his recent book, "The Transformation of the noted military historian Martin van Creveld argues that since modern
states are no longer able to fight each other for fear of nuclear war,
conventional warfare, too, has become outmoded. Since the purpose of
states (at least in the view of military historians) is to fight each
other, states that cannot do so must sooner or later yield to
organizations that will, like sects, tribes and cults.
"In North America and Western Europe, future war-making entities will
probably resemble the Assassins, the group which ... terrorized medieval Middle East for two centuries," van Creveld predicts. armed forces, as has happened in Lebanon, will degenerate into forces or mere armed gangs; the day of the condottieri will Van Creveld is not the only analyst to fear for the state. From different reasoning, the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington argued
in a widely read essay in Foreign Affairs last year that world would be shaped in future by clashes between cultures and religions. As
the West loses its military and economic predominance, the
counterresponse from the rest of the world will be couched in and cultural terms: "The fault lines between civilizations will be the
battle lines of the future," he wrote.
Even without fully embracing these forecasts of the state's it's hard to ignore such recent incidents as the bombing of the Trade Center or the car bombings of Jewish organizations in Buenos Aires
and London. Terrorists with secure phones, satellite maps, positioning and a sophisticated understanding of modern systems could bring down not just a few buildings but large sections of
a modern economy.
Big Brother is dead. The only serious likelihood of his lies in reaction to the chaos and disintegration that an era of Brothers might bring.

Perhaps to avoid counter-objections that matters of definition all to often lead back into nominalistic debates, you will be able to suggest practical examples of what you mean by "dangerous", "frightful", "serious consequences", "kicking the crucial foundation out from under freedom", and the like.  Sometimes these melodramatic terms obscure rather than point toward concrete situations that will convey your intentions more effectively.
Your strong feelings on these matters are clear, but I for one do not know what you would do in place of what Hal, and others, are proposing, to build and sustain reputations in the electronic realm.

Forwarding mail by: HRL (Howard Ray Lawrence 814 238 9535) on      - - The original note follows - -
Doors of Perception 2: ' Conference
4+5+6 November 1994
RAI Congress Center Amsterdam
the Netherlands
*Doors of Perception* is an important meeting point for all those  interested in the design challenge of interactivity. The first conference,  in November 1993, was attended at relatively short notice by nearly 700  people from 20 countries.
*Aim of the conference
The 1994 conference, which is organised by the Netherlands Design Institute  with Mediamatic Magazine, will further develop discussion about culture,  context and innovation. The subject's importance was well put by Terry  Winograd: 'major leaps only happen when someone has a new insight into the
larger picture, and can escape from the old context'. That is the aim of  *Doors 2*.
Speakers will focus on a particular context, 'home' - as market, as  metaphor, and as myth. Industry has great expectations for home as a site  for new products, as an outlet for entertainment and information services,  and as a place of work. But when a new technology enters a culture, the  culture changes. What does that mean for 'home'?
design,  philosophy, anthropology, and psychology, speakers will consider the  cultural impact of technology on work and play, home and school, learning  and entertainment. They will compare the qualities of telematic space and  domestic space. They will talk about real nomads and telematic nomads. They will analyse changes to our  sense of place, both public and private. They will look at the psychology  of belonging - to a family, group, or community. They will explore the  architecture of information, and the creation of shared meaning, in  virtual communities.
The point of this debate is that uncritical assumptions, and a crude use of  'real world' metaphors about the home, can actually stifle innovation. Vast  resources are being devoted to digital versions of existing human  activities - teleshopping, video-on-demand, telecommuting; but attempts to  create entirely new uses for the technologies have been unambitious, to say
the least. Doors of Perception gives equal emphasis to thinking and doing.  It is not a trade show - neither is it exclusive: chief executives and  young creatives are equally 'at home' at this unique event.

*Christopher Alexander
author of 'A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction': After a  ten-year silence, Christopher Alexander and his colleagues at the Center  for Environmental Strucure published a major statement in the form of three  books which will, in their words, 'lay the basis for an entirely new  approach to architecture, building and planning, which will replace  existing ideas and practices entirely'. At the core of his books is the  idea that people should design for themselves their own houses, streets,  and com
munities. This idea may be radical (it implies a radical transformation of  the architectural profession) but it comes simply from the observation that  most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects but  by the people.
Also author of: 'The Timeless Way of Building': The theory of architecture  implicit in our world today, Christopher Alexander believes, is bankrupt.  More and more people are aware that something is deeply wrong. Yet the  power of present-day ideas is so great that many feel uncomfortable, even  afraid, to say openly that they dislike what is happening, because they are  afraid to seem foolish, afraid perhaps that they will be laughed at. Now,  at last, here is a coherent theory which describes in modern terms an architecture as ancient as human society itself. Christopher Alexander  presents a new theory of architecture, building, and planning which has at  its core that age-old process by which the people of a society have always  pulled the order of their world from their own being.

@_subject: NYT on Electronic Purses 
The New York Times today reports:
"Electronic purses" may mean the end of cash.  Banks, credit card companies and even some governments are racing to introduce electronic purses, wallet-size cards embedded with microchips that store sums of money for people to use instead of cash for everything from buying fast food to paying highway * * *
Long-range planners in the banking industry see the weaning of small businesses and consumers from cash as the last step to closing many expensive branches and conducting virtually all business by telephone, through cash machines and perhaps home * * *
"As more and more people do business on the Internet, we have to look for how you pay for things," said Catherine Allen, a vice president in Citibank's technology office and the head of the Smart Card Forum, an industry group.  "The smart card allows me to identify myself securely."
* * *
But Mondex [Britain's system] has still another wrinkle:  Unlike most other electronic purse systems, Mondex, like cash, is anonymous.  The banks that issue Mondex cards will not be able to keep track of who gets the payments.  Indeed, it is the only system in which two card holders can transfer money to each other.
"If you want to have a product that replaces cash, you have to do everything that cash does, only better," Mondex's senior executive, Michael Keegan said.  "You can give money to your brother who gives it to the chap that sells newspapers, who gives it to charity, who puts it in the bank, which has no idea where it's been.  That's what money is." End quotes.
The article describes smart card systems in the US and other countries.  Describes how customers "recharge" the card by home phone or other means. Email copies wanted?  It's about a half-page in size.

Responding to msg by tcmay (Timothy C. May) on Wed, 7 Sep  4:14 PM
It is worth noting that private "data havens" of all sorts abound, especially for financial matters, and most are not subject to governmental regulation.
Some banks have research departments that are older and more comprehensive than credit reporting agencies.  Favored customers can use them for evaluation of private deals.  Large law firms maintain data banks that approach those of banks, and they grow with each case, through additions of private investigators paid for by successive clients.
Security professionals, like Wackenhut and Kroll, also market the fruits of substantial data collections.
To these add those of insurance, bonding, investment, financial firms and the like which help make or break business deals.
It's probable that massive government-regulated consumer data banks contain far less useful information than that of the private market where serious money is made with the best, privileged information.
Some may be porous but most are guarded better than Ft. Knox, with special protection against Uncle Sam's snoopers, indeed more secure than consumer records because more valuable.
Any c'punkers in the security side of the financial industry want to comment?  Anonymously of course.

Responding to msg by doug (Doug Cutrell) on Fri, 9 Sep 12:36 PM:
Your critique has elicited some of the best responses I've seen There is still, indeed,  the task of proving that cryptoanarchy is not itself a play for power by those who write and master its cryptographic code.  But better to test that in the public arena rather remain hidden and protected like the state secrecy of governmental cryptography.
The state will probably fiercely  oppose it, not least by stigmatizing cryptoanarchy and impugning its motives by exaggeration and distortion.
(It is worth recalling that classical black anarchy, the secret, lethal version as distinguished from open black flag type, is used by despots to justify their ruthless measures.  Black anarchists, as agents of despots,  mingle with avowed flag-wavers to spy and provoke acts that lead to repressive crackdowns.  Black anarchists never announce themselves as such but may freely admit to being "anarchistic" as a wild-eyed subterfuge.  Inept provocations sometimes reveal them but the most able are never detected.)
I may be helpful to read one writer's view of how cryptoanarchy may be lumped with and targeted like other stigmatized groups whose attributes it may claim:

DEVIATIONS AND DEVIANCE
One such deviation is important here, the kind presented by
individuals who are seen as declining voluntarily and openly to
accept the social place accorded them, and who act irregularly somewhat rebelliously in connection with our basic institutions the family, the age-grade system, the stereotyped role-division
between the sexes, legitimate full-time employment involving
maintenance of a single governmentally ratified personal and segregation by class and race. These are the Those who take this stand on their own and by themselves might called eccentrics or "characters." Those whose activity is
collective and focused within some building or place (and often
upon a special activity) may be called cultists. Those who come
together into a sub-community or milieu may be called "social
deviants", and their corporate life a deviant community. They
constitute a special type, but only one type, of deviator.
If there is to be a field of inquiry called "deviance," it is
social deviants as here defined that would presumably its core. Prostitutes, drug addicts, delinquents, criminals, musicians, bohemians, gypsies, carnival workers, hobos, winos, people, full time gamblers, beach dwellers, homosexuals, and urban unrepentant poor -- these would be included.
These are the folk who are considered to be engaged in some kind of
collective denial of the social order. They are perceived as
failing to use available opportunity for advancement in the approved runways of society; they show open disrespect for betters; they lack piety; they represent failures in the
motivational schemes of society.
Once the core of social deviancy is established, one can proceed to
peripheral instances: community-based political radicals who only vote in a divergent way but spend more time with those of
their own kind than is politically necessary; the traveling who are not geared into the executive's work week, and spend time drifting from one summering place to another; expatriates,
employed or not, who routinely wander at least a few steps from PX and the American Express; the ethnic assimilation who are reared in the two worlds of the parent society and the
society of their parents, and resolutely turn away from the
conventional routes of mobility open to them, overlaying their
public school socialization with what many normals will see as grotesque costume of religious orthodoxy; the metropolitan
unmarried and merely married who disavail themselves of an
opportunity to raise a family, and instead support a vague that is in rebellion, albeit mild and short-lived, against the
family system
In almost all of these cases, some show of disaffiliation is as is also true of eccentrics and cultists, providing in this a thin line that can be drawn between all of them and deviators the other side, namely, the quietly disaffiliated--hobbyists become so devoted to their avocation that only a husk remains civil attachments, as in the case of some ardent stamp club tennis players, and sports car buffs.
Social deviants, as defined, flaunt their refusal to accept place and are temporarily tolerated in this gestural rebellion,
providing it is restricted within the ecological boundaries of
their community. Like ethnic and racial ghettos, these constitute a haven of self-defense and a place where the deviator can openly take the line that he is at least as good anyone else. But in addition, social deviants often feel that are not merely equal to but better than normals, and that the they lead is better than that lived by the persons they would
otherwise be. Social deviants also provide models of being for
restless normals, obtaining not only sympathy but also (Cultists acquire converts too, of course, but the focus is on
programs of action not styles of life.) The wise can become

Kudos, Tim, for adept mix of philosophy and gritty specifics, for brevity and wit.
When the mood strikes you, an update would be appreciated.
And, please, comments from those who have not seen this before or who may have forgotten.
The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto
Timothy  C.  May
A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy. Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-routing of packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be
of central importance, far more important in dealings than even credit ratings of today.
These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the
ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of
trust and reputation.
The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social
and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The
methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction,
authentication, and verification. The focus has until now been academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently have networks and  personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the
ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards,
satellites,  Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and
encryption chips now under development will be some of the technologies. The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by
drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make
possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But
this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.
Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of
medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.
Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!

The fractal steganography sounds promising.  Is this yours or has it been done?
The need for authentic sigs on architectural and engineering drawings is not merely aesthetic.  Right now municipal agencies will not accept digital documents because of the lack of verifiable authorship to establish responsibility, and liability, for the health and safety of the design and construction.  Hard copy with original seal is required to prevent unauthorized manipulation.
Beyond copyright protection, architectural and engineering documents are means to guide actual construction, rather than end products like paintings and drawings in the art world.
If there could be a way for buildings themselves to convey authenticity, say, that they are healthy and safe, by a kind decryption by the public that could help prevent concealment of shoddy construction.  It's not the drawings that assure safety but field verification of the end result that construction work was done right.
What a great help if a building could convey its own message of authenticity about its fitness and safety for habitation and use.  That might keep us architects more honest.
Probably a long shot that your fractal idea could be stretched this far, but it is certainly needed in the flim flam world of New York City real estate where deception about building safety and health is all too common.
Any other thoughts?

On the contrary, his optimism, it seems to me, derives from his own hard work and original thinking not from parroting any party line.
With this he is in the company of original thinkers like Karl Hess, Murrary Bookchin and others who have garnered the courage to grow beyond the simple faith of left-right comforts and Their writings have a generosity of scope and purpose that exemplify how to assess specific problems and to prescribe remedies, and thereby perhaps help us break free of the mesmerizing, melodramatic defecations of partisan politics.

RSA Data Security
Says Exposed Code
Poses No Threat
By Ralph T. King Jr.
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
The anonymous dissemination over the last several
days of a software code used to safeguard the
privacy of electronic messages in no way threatens
the security of existing computer networks,
according to the code's owner and encryption
However, the defiant act is expected to trigger a
trade-secret dispute between the culprit and RSA
Data Security Inc., the Redwood City, Calif.,
company that developed the code. The act also
raises thorny legal questions about how public
data networks, collectively known as the Internet,
may be used.
An unidentified person used the Internet to post
RSA's encryption code, called RC4, on electronic
bulletin boards. The RC4 code works something like
a padlock. But knowing how the lock works isn't
enough to open it. The system user has an
individualized combination or key that prevents
access by other parties to private computer
messages. RSA's code product is incorporated in numerous
popular software programs, including those of
Apple Computer Inc., Lotus Development Corp. and
Microsoft Corp. Some reports published over the
weekend indicated that the disclosure might
jeopardize the integrity of computer systems that
are equipped with these programs.
"This doesn't compromise systems that are in use,"
says Jim Bidzos, president of closely-held RSA.
"This is a misappropriation of our intellectual
property. It's a legal issue and it will be
pursued." Mr. Bidzos also said officials at U.S.
Customs Service and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation are investigating the matter.
One analyst noted that disclosure of the formula
may benefit RSA because some users have questioned
whether its code contains the equivalent of secret
trapdoors enabling people familiar with it to
eavesdrop on private communications at will. As a
result, some computer operators have turned to an
alternative code whose formula is publicly
available. Now it will be clear to interested parties that no
such trapdoors exist, Mr. Bidzos said. In any
case, RSA is about to release a new encryption
code for use with the latest computer-chip
architecture, he said.
One possible effect of the disclosure is to shed
light on the extent of legal liability that
applies to people who make copyrighted or
protected material freely available on the
Internet. Those who use such material under
license typically sign nondisclosure agreements.
In this case, someone apparently violated a
nondisclosure pact and in effect invalidated the
protections of RSA, the formula's owner.

Bill Would Ensure
Law Enforcement
Is Able to Tap Wires
By Mary Lu Carnevale
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
 WASHINGTON - The House Judiciary Committee cleared
a bill that would require telephone companies to
ensure that their networks remain accessible to law
enforcement wiretaps.
 But key lawmakers agreed to changes aimed at
appeasing local phone companies. The modifications
largely spell out that phone companies won't be
forced to pay to modify their existing networks to
comply with the measure. They are expected to be
included in the bill before it goes to the House
floor, possibly as early as Tuesday.
 A similar measure sailed through the Senate
Judiciary Committee earlier this week on a 16-1
vote. Though little time remains in the current
Congress, the legislation could squeak through.
* * *
 The agreement, details of which are being ironed
out, also aims to protect individuals' privacy
rights; prevent phone companies or law-enforcement
agencies from installing or ordering unnecessary
upgrades; and ensure that the changes have the
least possible effect on phone rates and
phone-company efforts to build advanced
communications networks.
 The legislation is separate from the Clinton
administration's controversial "Clipper Chip"
proposal that would have mandated an encryption
standard for computer and communications equipment.
That failed proposal would have let law-enforcement
agencies decipher any calls or messages that had
been encoded.

Responding to msg by ogd (ozymandias G desiderata) on Mon, 03 Oct 11:49 AM
The best I heard is that of a fairly noteworthy 60s radical who asked for his FBI file and was completely demoralized to learn that his FOIA request was the first and only item in his brand new file.
No one there cared about him until then -- or so he was told.  Since then I have heard that this was a
technique used by the LEAs to blow people away and discourage them from getting their real files.
Quite illegal, to be sure, but well within approved procedures of the time.  Probably still done.

Good and bad news in today's NYT on a controversial new libertarian (I think) community.

Col. James (Bo) Gritz, a Vietnam-era Green Beret and onetime Populist Party candidate for President, with what is likely to be the first community ever built around fear and hatred of the Federal Government.
Mr. Gritz, who discovered Idaho during the Presidential campaign, says he is a patriot who has become disgusted with the "cesspool" of public schools, the "grip of the international bankers" on the nation's currency, and "an encroaching, ravenous, predator Government," which wants to disarm the citizenry and force people to carry health cards.
. . . in an advertisement for his paramilitary programs, he says, "You will learn what weapon and ammunition type is best in times of grave peril; how to carry, draw, hold and efficiently engage multiple targets.
It is this kind of language that has many people worried that their hamlet will become the next Waco.
"The tyrants who ordered the assault on Waco should be tried and executed as traitors," Mr. Gritz wrote in a recent issue of his newsletter.
. . . Mr. Gritz said, "I want a community where if the F.B.I. looks at us, they'll end up saying it's more trouble than it's End quote.
The bad news, or maybe good, is that the Times then goes on to ridicule Mr. Gritz and his cohorts.

triple-DES cannot be
overseas, since all
Although NSA will neither confirm nor deny  one of the fundamental principles of cryptography is that any encryption system which cannot be broken is also inefficient - like the one-time-pad.  NSA may be concerned with allocation of CRAY resources, but I doubt they are concerned about the viability of breaking triple-DES.
One of the most important concepts of cryptography is that false security is worse than poor security, for if you are aware of a system's vulnerability, you can guard the weak points.  NSA's point that layering encryptions not only doesn't strengthen the security, but may create patterning that is more susceptible to differential analysis than a single DES pass, is an important one.  More is frequently less in crypto.
Now, I have no more insight into NSA motivations than the next shmoe, but the objections they raise are legitimate from a security standpoint.
As for independent creation in Europe, there is a component to "real" hardware DES which is classified.

Mr. Steven Levy writes an admirable article on "E-Money" in December Wired, with emphasis on Chaum's venture, along with various opinions of e-cash systems, the role of cryptography and the salient thoughts of Mr. Eric Hughes.
Mr. Levy, I pray, will excuse my quoting two provocative excerpts to induce reading the whole piece:
"Corleta Brueck, the project manager for the IRS's Document Processing System, described some of the IRS's plans.  These include the so-called 'Golden Eagle' return, in which the government automatically gathers all relevant aspects of a person's finances, sorts them into approriate categories and then tallies the tax due.  'One stop service,' as Brueck puts it.  This information would be fed to other government agencies, as well as states and municipalities, which would draw upon it for their own purposes.  She vows 'absolutely' that this will happen, assuming that Americans will be grateful to be relieved of the burden of filing any taxes.  The government will simply take its due." . . .
"[Brueck continues] 'We know everyting about you that we need to know.  Your employer tells us everything about you that we need to know. Your activity records on your credit cards tell us everything about you that we need to know.  Through interface with Social Security, with the DMV, with your banking institutions, we really have a lot of information . . . We could literally file a return for you.  This is the future we'd like to go to.' "
* * *
"It isn't the future that David Chaum would like to go to, and in hopes of preventing that degree of openess in an individual's affairs, he continues doggedly in his crusade for privacy. . . . He thinks that if an economic system that tracks all transactions comes to cyberspace, the result would be much worse than in the physical world.  'Cyberspace doesn't have all the physical constraints,' he says.  'There are not walls . . . it's a different, scary, weird place, and with identification it's a panopticon nightmare.' "
End quotes.
And, yes, for the Chaum-uncharmed, Mr. Chaum was rude to Mr. Levy.  Whether Mr. L. is rude in kind to Mr. C. is an exercise left to the reader.

"And flirting with heresy, Mr. Spindler says he sees no need for the so-called information superhighway.  And 500 channels?  Sixty are plenty.  'This is not going to be an all-electronic world where we all sit on a couch and are force-fed a constant stream of information,' said Mr. Sindler."
"Mr. Spindler took pains to contrast himself with two of his industry's rivals -- and vaunted visionaries -- William H. Gates, chairman of Microsoft, and Andrew S. Grove, chairman of Intel.  'They believe that just because of technospeak it's going to happen, but it's not,' said Mr. Spindler."
"And yet, Mr. Spindler, even as he decries the industry's preoccupation with the so-called vision thing, acknowledges that there are still ways of improving the life of the computer user.  'We still have to switch our computers on and off,' he said.  'We go to the restroom, and when we leave it flushes automatically.' "

@_subject: NYT on Insecure Phones 
The New York Times last Thursday had two pieces on
   telephones that may be of interest.
   One deals with cellular fraud in NYC, given entirely here:
   "Cellular Fraud in New York
         Cellular telephone fraud in New York City has become    rampant that a cellular service in Washington will
   temporarily block its customers from using their wireless
   phones when they travel in New York.
         Cellular One of Washington-Baltimore, owned by SBC
   Communications Inc., has sent its customers letters
   notifying them that it would block the service beginning on
   Thursday because it had compiled a huge backlog of phone
   numbers used in New York that appeared to be fraudulent.
         Company officials said they would resume service once
   they finished investigating each case, which they said
   would take three weeks.
         Cellular telephone fraud occurs when people use false
   identification numbers on their wireless telephones and
   make calls. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry
   Association said fraud costs had soared to about $1 billion
   a year.
         Cellular thieves typically use radio scanners to    the identification numbers of legitimate cellular phones,
   which transmit the numbers each time they are used. These
   numbers are then written onto a computer chip inside an
   inactive phone, effectively 'cloning' the original."
   -------------------
   End illegitimate fraud article
   Then, probably not coincidentally in this happy
   legitimate-fraud shopping season, there was a long
   consumer-oriented article the very same day, alors, about
   new cordless phones, including this info about security
   features against illegitimate fraud:
   "A new generation of digital cordless phones using a
   powerful 900 megahertz (MHz) frequency ... blocks thieves
   who scan the airwaves listening for credit card and Social
   Security numbers people innocently give over the phone. ...
   Cellular car phones and two-way radio car service
   conversations were constant unwanted companions with the
   standard cordless phones [but] with the 900 MHz phones, the
   interference was practically non-existent. ...
   The Cincinnati Microwave Escort 9020 Digital Spread
   Spectrum Cordless Telephone is one of the first models to
   feature spread-spectrum technology -- originally developed
   for the military and now being used for consumers -- that
   digitally scrambles voice communications before
   transmitting them. ...
   ... newer standard-frequency models are offering improved
   security.  By using scrambling technology -- though not as
   sophisticated as digital spread spectrum -- they block out
   most eavesdroppers.  Panasonic calls the feature Secure
   Guard; Motorola, Secure Clear, and Toshiba, Call Protect.    It doesn't add much to the cost ($10 to $25) and is well
   worth the money, although the phone is not as secure as a
   digital one."

And, while not directly related to crypto, the magazine "The Sciences", published by the New York Academy of Sciences, has a long article, "Beyond E=mc(2)", on a controversial theory that mass is "only electric charge and energy".
The authors are:  Bernard Haisch, Alfonso Rueda and H. E. For copy send blank message with subject:  EMC2_too
Here is a brief excerpt:
   Recent work by us and others now appears to offer a
   radically different insight into the relation E=mc(2), as
   well as into the very idea of mass itself. To put it
   simply, the concept of mass may be neither fundamental nor
   necessary in physics. In the view we will present,
   Einstein's formula is even more significant than physicists
   have realized. It is actually a statement about how much
   energy is required to give the appearance of a certain
   amount of mass, rather than about the conversion of one
   fundamental thing, energy, into another fundamental thing,
   mass.
   Indeed, if that view is correct, there is no such thing as
   mass -- only electric charge and energy, which together
   create the illusion of mass. The physical universe is made
   up of massless electric charges immersed in a vast,
   energetic, all-pervasive electromagnetic field. It is the
   interaction of those charges and the electromagnetic field
   that creates the appearance of mass. In other words, the
   magazine you now hold in your hands is massless; properly
   understood, it is physically nothing more than a collection
   of electric charges embedded in a universal energetic
   electromagnetic field and acted on by the field in such a
   way as to make you think the magazine has the property of
   mass. Its apparent weight and solidity arise from the
   interactions of charges and field.
   Besides recasting the prevailing view of mass, this idea
   would address one of the most profound problems of physics,
   the riddle of how gravity can be unified with the other
   three fundamental forces of nature. The electromagnetic
   force and the weak force, which is responsible for nuclear
   decay, have been shown to be two manifestations of a single
   force, appropriately called the electroweak force. There
   are tantalizing hints that the strong force, which binds
   nuclei together, will someday be unified with the
   electroweak force. But until now gravity has resisted all
   attempts at unification. If the new view is correct,
   however, gravity would not need to be separately unified.
   Just as mass would arise from the electromagnetic force, so
   would gravity.

Here are few excerpts:
   In recent weeks, evoking memories of Richard Nixon at the
   height of the Watergate crisis, Mr. Grove has retreated to
   his "war room" inside the company's corporate headquarters
   in Santa Clara.
   ***
   'Righteousness'
   How did a sporadic arithmetic error that was not detected
   for months, in the chip that Intel insists is its most
   heavily tested microprocessor in history, become the heart
   of such a debacle?
   The answer is rooted in Intel's distinctive corporate
   culture, and suggests that Intel went wrong in much the
   same way as other big and unresponsive companies before it.
   Intel has traditionally valued engineering over product
   marketing. Inward-looking and wary of competitors (from
   experience with the Japanese), it developed a bunker
   mentality, a go-for-the-jugular attitude and a reputation
   for arrogance.
   "There are certain elements in Intel's culture, and one is
   righteousness," said Federico Faggin, a former Intel
   engineer and co-inventor of its first microprocessor.
   "The attitude at Intel is, 'We're better than everyone else
   and what we do is right and we never make mistakes.' "
   ***
   But the technologist's mind-set did little to prepare Intel
   for the consumer marketplace. Although it spent hundreds of
   millions of dollars on its "Intel Inside" and Pentium ad
   campaigns, the consumer-oriented strategy unraveled last
   month when Mr. Grove dismissed customers' requests for
   chips to replace the Pentium.
   ***
   "What Intel clearly should have done is issued a bug report
   as soon as they found out it was a reproducible problem,"
   said Timothy May, a former Intel semiconductor engineer.
   "Instead, by keeping it mum, they backed themselves into a
   corner."
   But although he has issued a public apology for the flaw,
   Mr. Grove has been unwilling to personally come forward in
   an effort to restore customer confidence.
   "The test of a great company is in how they handle
   disasters," said James F. Moore, head of Geopartners, a
   high-tech consulting firm. "This is one where you can't
   behave like a paranoid. This is one where only the
   compassionate survive."

Some tidbits:
   New Shot at Cold Fusion
   By Pumping Sound Waves
   Into Tiny Bubbles
   [Drawing caption]
   New Fusion Recipe:  Sound Plus Bubbles
   Fusion creates great energy but requires tremendous
   temperatures. In a new approach that scientists hope might
   reach such temperatures, they are using minuscule bubbles
   as the focus for sound waves. In this figure, a tiny
   heating element boils just enough water to create a single
   micron-sized bubble. A sound field makes the bubble
   pulsate. As it expands, it absorbs sound energy. Then it
   violently collapses, launching a spherical, inward-moving
   supersonic shock wave, which produces enormous temperatures
   and a flash of light.
   By Malcolm W. Browne
   Ever since the first hydrogen bomb was detonated in 1952,
   scientists have sought to harness thermonuclear fusion as
   a peaceful power source, but that goal has proved
   tantalizingly elusive. Now, however, there seems to be an
   outside chance that a wholly new technique could achieve
   it. Bombarding microscopic bubbles with intense sound waves
   could convert the bubbles into minuscule fusion furnaces.
   Recent experiments by a half-dozen laboratories suggest
   that a mysterious phenomenon called sonoluminescence may be
   capable of raising the temperature of gas trapped in a tiny
   bubble to 1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit or more -- enough,
   in principle, to ignite fusion.
   If fusion were achieved, a microbubble could be expected to
   radiate neutrons, nuclear particles produced by
   thermonuclear reactions. So far, the laboratories
   experimenting with sonoluminescence have failed to detected
   any neutrons, but there are other signs that the project is
   far from hopeless.
   ***
   Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California, the nation's
   preeminent hydrogen bomb laboratory, has conducted some
   small experiments on "sonofusion," the name that would be
   bestowed on any fusion technique powered by sonoluminescent
   bubbles.
    As part of its nuclear weapons research programs during the
   1980's, Livermore built the Nova laser, which focuses
   multiple beams of ultrapowerful lasers from all directions
   on a small target. Among the targets Livermore has tested
   are tiny, hollow glass spheres filled with hydrogen
   isotopes. In a typical experiment, the laser beams are
   turned on, the glass instantly vaporizes and the resulting
   shock wave of glass vapor is driven inward to compress the
   hydrogen. The idea is to get the hydrogen hot enough to
   initiate fusion.
   ***
   Still, the nation's thermonuclear bomb designers eventually
   solved similar problems for full-scale hydrogen bombs, and
   Livermore's scientists believe that inertial confinement
   fusion as a means of generating comparatively cheap
   electric power will eventually prove to be practical.
   The tiny bubbles used in sonoluminescence experiments are
   similar in terms of their fusion physics to their big
   brothers, hydrogen bombs and on a smaller scale, to the
   glass spheres used in inertial confinement fusion.

Perry makes an astute critique about the Peter Lewis article today on anonymity.  I hope that he or someone takes the time to write The Times with polite corrections or a cataclysmic I would note that the two law professors quoted are active on mail list Cyberia-L, where many of the cypherpunks issues are debated from a legal perspective.  Peter Lewis is a subscriber to that list.
Peter Lewis wrote yesterday about the LaMacchia case dismissal.  The article was reprinted verbatim today.  It too focussed on the need for legislation.  (Todd posted Reuter's version.)
Is it any wonder that lawyers are quoted when enhanced law and order are immanent?  Mike Godwin, of EFF and also a Cyberia-L subscriber, takes a dissenting view from that presented by those quoted by Lewis.  Or so I would judge from his posts on the LaMacchia case.
My one-cent's worth to the anonymity topic is that The NYT may be drum-beating for legislation to regulate anonymity -- a characteristicly paternalistic role of the self-important power-brokering running-dog mad-dog yellow-dog hyenia-slobbering anarchy-hating media.

It is one thing to claim First Amendment protection to shield  political speech, IMHO it is another to shield fraud and criminal  behavior.
Besides the First Amendment runs against the government, not in  favor of individuals in actions brought by private parties.  In  the sexism thread, would anyone claim that an individual has the  right to harass or stalk a person under the guise of the First  Amendment?  Would the First Amendment be a defense in a defamation  suit?  Of course not (Times v. Sullivan aside).  Doesn't an  individual have the right to know the identity of someone who is  trying to communicate with him/her on a private basis?  To a  certain extent, the question was crystallized in the caller ID  debate -- Who has the superior right, the calling party to anonymity or the called party to knowing who is calling?
One of the areas of my professional concern is the use of  cyberspace for securities fraud and manipulation.  Cyberspace is  an ideal medium for these activities because of the availability  of anonymity and pseudonymity.  Even on commercial BBSs, where  "member lists" are available, posting to these lists is voluntary  and those who draw my attention are rarely on these lists.  Does  all of cyberspace become off limits to conventional private rights  and law enforcement under the rubric of "freedom of speech and  assembly?"

The New York Times    January 10, 1995, D2.    Mastercard to Develop On-Line Standard    By Saul Hansell    Joining a stampede of companies that hope to profit from    shopping on computer networks, Mastercard International    said yesterday that it would develop standards for its    cards to be used on the Internet.    Mastercard, an association of banks that is based in New    York, said it would use the technology developed by the    Netscape Communications Corporation of Mountain View,    Calif., a specialist in software for the Internet, the    global web of computer networks.    The Internet allows a company to make information on its    products available to millions of computer users around the    world. Increasingly, companies would like to consummate    sales using the Internet as well, but the open nature of    the network may allow credit card numbers to be stolen.    "The problem with the Internet is there is no privacy and    no security," said Edward J. Hogan, a senior vice president    of Mastercard.    The Mastercard plan is one of several attempts to translate    credit card numbers into a code before they are sent to    merchants selling goods over the network and then on to the    credit card companies.    Visa International has said it will develop its own    encryption system with the Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft    has hinted that it may charge a fee for every transaction    using its system, though the details have not been    announced. Netscape and Mastercard say their transaction    standards will be openly published and free for other    companies to use.    Netscape's main business is selling software that allows    companies to publish information on the Internet. To expand    the market, it gives away or sells for a very small fee    software that allows people to view nformation on the    Internet.    The company has already included a component to encrypt    credit card numbers with its current version. The first    merchants to allow purchases using that feature will be    part of an electronic shopping service to be introduced by    the MCI Communications Corporation later this month.    The initial Netscape credit card system allows customers to    use any brand of card. It did not involve the cooperation    of credit card companies, but rather used existing rules    that related to mail and telephone card orders.    The agreement with Mastercard will for the first time allow    purchases on the Internet with automatic teller machine or    debit cards, which withdraw money from checking accounts.    Mastercard will likely agree to absorb the losses from    fraud on the system. Under the existing Netscape system,    merchants selling goods are liable if fraudulent card    numbers are used, as are companies that sell goods by mail    or telephone.    The debit card access and the fraud guarantee are expected    to be available by the fall.    End

New York Post, January 9, 1995    Front Page, pp. 8, 9. Four articles.    A Post Investigation    Computer Sickos Target Your Kids    Child-porn perverts roam info-highway    Furor Over Cybersmut    Molesters With a Modem    Kiddie-sex perverts using computers to lure victims    By Lou Lumenick and Kieran Crowley    City cops are about to start patrolling the information    superhighway to hunt down child pornographers and    pedophiles who are luring kids through high-tech computer    bulletin boards, The Post has learned.    "The bulletin boards are a total haven for pedophiles,"    said Sgt. Richard Perrine, who's forming a new computer    investigation unit.    There are no names and faces, and a 33-year-old man can    pass himself off as a 10-year-old kid." Perrine said the    new unit, in the NYPD's Organized Crime Control Bureau,    plans to include computer child-pornographers and    pedophiles among its targets.    "We haven't really solidified our strategy yet," he told    The Post.    "This is something that's so new, law enforcement is not    quite ready for it."    Law-enforcement officials say pedophiles are lurking on the    nation's three major on-line services, America Online    Prodigy and Compuserve where kiddie-sex perverts are using computers    to lure victims -- as well as on the worldwide Internet,    smaller online services, and locally-operated computer    bulletin boards.    On-line services are an easy way for pedophiles to meet    children anonymously, noted Dyanne Greer, a senior lawyer    with the National Center for the Prosecution of Child    Abuse.    "Many cases are not reported, so I'm not sure anybody is    really aware how much this is going on," she said.    A Post probe uncovered these on-line horror stories:       Westchester computer expert George Telesha pretended to be       a 14-year-old girl on America Online and was quickly       besieged by perverts sending dirty pictures.       A Manhattan computer expert allegedly got a 13-year-old New       Jersey boy he met on-line to go skating with him.       Cops said the man lured the youth into the woods near the       boy's home and sexually abused him six times between last       July and September.       An unemployed Brooklyn computer programmer tried to       sodomize a Nevada teen-ager he met on a computer bulletin       board.       A 27-year-old computer engineer in Cupertino, Calif.,       allegedly met a 14-year-old boy through America Online.       He is charged with handcuffing, shackling and blindfolding       the boy and then taking him to his apartment, where he       whipped him with a belt, shaved his pubic hair and had sex       with him.       California man sent pornographic photos via computer to a       teen-ager, then sought to have the teen killed to silence       him.    Such crimes are not easy to investigate or prosecute,    officials note.    "It's a bigger problem than most people realize," said Mike    Brick, director of the Orlando bureau of the Florida State    Office of Law Enforcement.    "There's a lot of people out there who want to have sex    with children. If they hang out at a real playground, a    teacher or someone might see them. In the computer    playground they can more or less hide in the bushes."    A handful of agencies have staffers pose as youngsters to    solicit dirty pictures and come-ons, but many don't have    the manpower, equipment or inclination to do so on a    regular basis.    And even if they did, experts say there's probably no way    to completely stop on-line perverts -- who constitute a    tiny fraction of overall on-line communicators -- short of    shutting down the services.    And that is not only unlikely, but would rob children and    others of a valuable educational resource.    The services say they're concerned -- but in no position to    play the role of police.    AOL spokeswoman Pam McGraw said computer-privacy laws keep    her company's hands tied when it comes to the    person-to-person type of communication in which porn can be    exchanged in electronic "private chat rooms."    "Federal law prevents us from monitoring E-mail," McGraw    said. "We do our best to prevent misuse of our service."    She urged AOL customers to report offensive communications    -- which are prohibited under company rules -- so the    company can warn offenders or eject them from the system.    Law-enforcement officials say on-line companies are quick    to cut off perverts and help track down and prosecute    pedophiles and pornographers.    But the crimes still flourish because computers make life    simpler for the perverts.    Pedophiles can easily pretend to be a child online, or even    someone of the opposite sex, to help draw a child into a    trap. And they can elude detection by using false names and    post office boxes.    "Offenders can say they're other kids, then arrange for    face-to-face meetings," Greer said. "It's pretty scary when    you find out you're dealing with a 47-year-old man instead    of the 14-year-old you expected."    Greer said some pedophiles have convinced children to pose    for pornographic pictures. The pedophiles then trade the    pictures with other perverts, or use the pictures to draw    in other kids "and break down their inhibitions," she said.    End Article 1    Article 2    Photo:    CREEP CATCHERS: Special agent Mike Brick (white shirt) of    the Florida state police and another agent track a    pedophile on the computer.    How to protect your children    Steps parents can take to stop on-line pedophiles    By Lou Lumenick    Parents must take the offensive to protect their children    from on-line perverts, experts say.    "You wouldn't let a young child hang out in a playground or    mall alone, so don't let them hang out in the computer    playground by themselves," said Mike Brick of the Florida    Department of Law Enforcement. "You need to exercise the    same caution."    So what can a parent do? First of all, experts say talk    with someone at your on-line system -- whether it's America    Online, Prodigy, Compuserve, Genie Delphi or one of the    others.    All of them allow users to limit access by children.    Subscribers to America Online, for instance, can bar their    children from the private "chat rooms," where the more    sexually explicit conversations take place.    Most services will also allow you to disable one-on-one    conversations when your child logs on.    Then talk with your children.    Rule No. 1 is that they must never ever give their real    name, address or telephone number to anyone on-line.    Rule No. 2 is that they must never ever agree to meet with    anyone they encounter on-line -- even if he says he's a kid    the same age who lives across the street. He could very    well be an adult willing to travel hundreds of miles for a    sexual encounter.    Beyond that, it's a matter of parental vigilance.    "Make the kids teach you how to use the computer," said    Dyanne Greer, a senior lawyer with the National Center for    the Prosecution of Child Abuse.    "Many parents take the attitude, 'Gee, my kids are learning    a skill.' That's very true, but you can't be left behind or    you won't know what's going on.    Many experts recommend moving the computer out of the kids'    bedroom into a more central place -- like the living room    -- so parents can keep a closer eye on things.    "If your kid wants to put the computer in his bedroom    closet, I would be very nervous," Brick said.

Telesha, 46, a bank computer specialist and president of    the Westchester chapter of the Fathers Rights Association,    heard from several dads that their kids were accessing porn    on their home computers.    So he decided to take a walk on the wild side -- on the    information superhighway.    Telesha, the father of two, pretended to be a 14-year-old    girl named "Suzy" on an America Online computer bulletin    board.    He said he was besieged with perverts who sent dirty    pictures.    Telesha said several men sent "Suzy" porno pictures, tried    to get her address and phone number -- and tried to lure    her out of her home.    "Can I come up to New York?" one out-of-state man said.    "Can I meet you? You don't have to tell your parents."    When "Suzy" mentioned her parents were not home, another    man became very insistent, Telesha said.    "I live in New York. Can I come over? I'll take you    shopping," the man messaged "Suzy" in trying to set up a    date at a local mall.    One man said he lived in New Jersey and invited "Suzy" over    for a photo session.    Telesha said his most disturbing exchange was with a man    who sent child sex pictures.    "Do you have any more of these?" Telesha asked.    "Usually, it's just one session," the man typed back.    "That sent chills through me," said Telesha, fearing the    photographed children may have been harmed.    "It's mind-boggling. I haven't slept in a week. What    happened to the children in these pictures? What is going    to happen to them?"    One AOL subscriber even offered hints on how to pick up    young girls and take pornographic pictures of them Telesha    said.    "I think people ought to know what's going on. I just want    to see it stopped," he said.    End Article 3    [Article 4 reports on exchanges between Telesha    masquerading as three different girls and AOL subscribers.

@_subject: WSJ on CIA Dump 
The Wall Street Journal    January 18, 1995, p. A14.    Get Smart -- Eliminate the CIA    By Angelo Codevilla    Over the past several years, U.S. intelligence agencies in    general and the CIA in particular have proved themselves    incompetent in peacetime and of little use in conflict.    Stripped of their mystique and lacking the capacity to    reform themselves, these organizations are virtually in    receivership.    The maladies ailing the intelligence community are    numerous. Independent quality control was never more than    a pretense, and competition among intelligence agencies was    nonexistent. Producers of intelligence -- rather than the    soldiers and diplomats who have to use it -- have also    become its judges. All this has spawned a complex of    habits, procedures, mentalities and people too entrenched    to be repaired and too noxious for any part to form the    nucleus of a new, healthy system. Hence, we should take    Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's advice, and rethink our    intelligence from the ground up.    A good place to start is with the fact that about half of    the $28 billion U.S. intelligence budget pays for units    directly controlled by military commanders, which routinely    provide precise information for the armed forces'    operations close to the front lines. The Treasury and State    Departments also have their own intelligence units, which    fit their needs quite well. So why do we need a national    system headed by the CIA?    The original justification for the creation of the CIA in    1947 was that intelligence would be best if its gathering    and evaluation were divorced as much as possible from the    operating departments of government -- State, Defense, etc.    -- and placed under the president. This judgment has turned    out to be wrong. Because presidents have relied on the CIA    to run the system, the result has been a system dominated    by the priorities of the producers -- not the users -- of    intelligence.    A basic failing is that the CIA has primary responsibility    for intelligence and none at all for real world events. The    CIA prefers to place its career employees in U.S.    embassies, where they pretend to be employees of other    parts of the government. Such "case officers" must    acknowledge that they are gathering information for the    U.S. Another disadvantage is that they don't speak foreign    languages well.    And unlike successful reporters, they virtually never know    the substantive fields about which they are seeking    information. Thus it is unsurprising that they are usually    outdone in economic reporting by economic reporters, in    military reporting by military reporters, and so forth.    The Aldrich Ames case shows how much more highly the CIA    values the smooth functioning of its system than what the    system produces. Mr. Ames handed the KGB the capacity to    shape the intelligence flowing to top U.S. officials during    the endgame of the Cold War. Thus disinformation made    presidents and secretaries of state more vulnerable to    Gorbomania than the average citizen informed by newspaper    accounts.    How could the CIA fail to notice the fishiness of reports    generated by a network controlled by the other side? The    same way that, in the 1970s and 1980s, the agency had    failed to notice that it was passing along reports from a    network of agents in Cuba totally controlled by Castro's    DGI, and from a network in East Germany all but a few of    whose agents were working for the Stasi. In other words,    while the Ames case was unusually destructive, it was a    typical example of bureaucratic sclerosis.    In the Gulf War, intelligence worsened the farther one got    away from the front lines. The national system headed by    the CIA misperceived the nature of Saddam Hussein's regime,    failed to grasp the obvious signs of attack, and has yet to    learn Saddam's military and political reasoning. Our    imaging satellites failed to find mobile Scud launchers,    and our communications intelligence antennas failed to shed    light on the diplomatic intercourse between Saddam and the    Soviets. National analysts misjudged Iraq's nuclear    program, and were fooled by elementary camouflage. Gen. H.    Norman Schwarzkopf's public belittling of CIA-run    intelligence was matched by unprintable epithets from field    commanders.    What happened in the Gulf would have happened in any    conflict because the intelligence community's cameras and    antennas were conceived, and its people trained, on the    CIA's assumption that cooperative competition with the    Soviet Union would last forever and that the basic designs    of weapons would not change. Thus cameras, for example,    were optimized to take pictures of fixed installations    rather than to keep track of attacking military forces or    mobile missile launchers.    Long before the Soviet collapse, however, it had become    clear that the CIA made bad bets. The age of mobile    missiles arrived long ago, and modern weapons are  defined    by the software they contain rather than by observable    features. So what's the point of, for example, analyzing a    radar signal that a computer can change in an instant?    Divorce from operational responsibility also tends to make    the reports that flow to top officials less valuable than    the information used to compile them. (In any given    subject, the CIA delivers a consensus of the system's    several agencies. It takes far more time for a paper to go    through the interagency process than for someone to write    the paper. Considering the elementary errors and ignorance    that often come out, it is clear that the conferees do not    spend much time fact-checking. Intelligence analysts become    spin doctors, concerned not with facts but with pushing    policy makers in the direction of their parent agencies'    prejudices. Hence the ultimate irony: A system whose    ostensible reason for being was to eliminate from    intelligence the parochial interests of tank drivers,    diplomats, bomber pilots, etc. ended up aggregating the    prejudices of the analysts -- prejudices unrelieved by the    sobering prospect of having to carry out the policies they    are pushing for.    The CIA has maintained a monopoly on judging the quality of    the system's operations and products. It does not heed    presidents, much less their appointees. A decade ago, the    agency ignored President Reagan's executive order to    reorganize counterintelligence. Two decades ago, President    Ford, shocked by how far intelligence estimates were    diverging from reality, asked a group of distinguished    outsiders (the B team) to see whether the intelligence    community's data on Soviet nuclear forces could support    conclusions different from those of the insider analysts.    The B Team, despite resistance from the agency, came up    with results far superior to the insider A Team's.    A better intelligence system should be built on a model    radically different from the 1947 original. Each of the    major departments of the U.S. government (State, Defense,    etc.) should be responsible for gathering and evaluating    the information it needs to operate in the new world    disorder. Intelligence, in short, should be franchised out    to its consumers. There is reason to believe that the    departments would do better without the ClA's tutelage than    with it. In the past, the armed forces have asked to deploy    officers who speak foreign languages, who could blend in    with the local population, and who would be experts in the    military fields on which they were reporting. U.S. military    leaders have also clamored for satellites whose products    they could use. Each time, the CIA made sure such requests    were denied. If those requests had been granted, the    country would be better informed.    In all this there is a need for some central coordination.    The several agencies have to mesh their quest for agents    abroad, lest they stumble over each other. The information    that any part of the government collects must be available    to properly cleared people in all other parts, so that any    and all analysis can be based on all the facts.    Fortunately, maintaining a central registry nowadays    requires computers, rather than the bureaucratic monster    that arose a half century ago.    Finally the president of the United States' own    intelligence needs should be provided by his own staff.    Among its duties should be to make sure that all the    agencies get each others' estimates. The availability to    the president and other top decision makers of contrasting    estimates from through out the government would stimulate    better performance all around. So, while there is a role    for a central intelligence agency in a system based on    consumer sovereignty, there is none for the CIA.

Commenting on Tim's comment about the decline of the guilds of "licensed
professionals" (I'm a licensed architect long-time arguing against the
breed's conceits and camouflages and irresponsibilities): Here in NYC there is a new trial policy to allow architects and engineers
to "self-certify" their construction documents as in compliance with the
building code rather than being approved by a municipal examiner. Over decades a sub-species has grown called "code consultants" or
"expediters", which advises and processes documents for A-E's who have
become ignorant of the arcana of the building code.  This group of several
hundred, has pretty muchly dominated, by default or by design, the
non-governmental side of construction through their specialized knowledge
of the code, procedures, interpretations, regulations and who to see for
favorable treatment in the Building Department. A-E's used these folks with happiness, usually, for it relieved the
self-certified high-minded animals to concentrate on the important stuff of
design and schmoozing and puffing feathers. On the municipal side, agency employees found that it was easier to deal
with these consultants than contrary professionals.  And, the culture
welcomed ex-public officials into their well-paid ranks to lubricate the
wheels. An odd result so far is that while owners and professionals like the idea
of speeding up the process they are reluctant to take on the concomitant
responsibility for deficiencies in meeting code standards in final
construction.  The city will inspect 20% to keep tabs. Both fear that they do not know the code well enough to take the risk of
being found at fault by random municipal inspections of construction. A-E's dread the liability and blame by owners for well-known construction
corner-cutting, and owners suspect their professionals competency and
ethics -- afraid that the pros will certify in ignorance or cupidity and
that the owners will face costly corrections without having the traditional
scapegoat of over-weening government to justify cheating in the field. The code consultants I've talked to say they wait for the animals
frightened of their own shadows to return to the safe stables.  Perhaps "code consultants" precurse the trajectory of cryptographers?

The New York Times    January 25, 1995, p. A9.    [Excerpts]    Clinton Orders Assets of Suspected Terrorist Groups Frozen    By Douglas Jehl    Washington, Jan. 24 -- Seeking to underscore an American    commitment to the fight against terrorism, President    Clinton today issued an executive order intended to cut off    the flow of funds from United States citizens to    organizations suspected of terrorist activities in Israel    and other countries.    Mr. Clinton's directive orders American financial    institutions to search for and immediately freeze any    accounts held in the names of Hamas, Islamic Holy War and    10 other organizations, and 18 of their top leaders.    It also forbids financial transfers from the United States    to those groups and individuals and will seek to prevent    them from gaining access to donations made to charitable    causes in the Middle East.    Administration officials said it was too soon to know    whether any assets would be uncovered.    While today's announcement at the White House emerged from    an Administration review concluding that the United States    could do more to limit terrorists' access to money, aides    to Mr. Clinton acknowledged that the timing had been    largely dictated by the quest for a tough-worded    centerpiece to the State of the Union address.    The aides said Mr. Clinton intended to use the speech in    part to demonstrate his commitment to preserving foreign    policy gains in the Middle East against those who would    scuttle peace efforts.    Even if the groups identified today do not hold accounts in    their names, the officials said the directive could give    the Government more power to block and deter transfers to    them -- even when those are disguised as contributions to    charity.    "It is not foolprooof," a senior Administration official    said at a White House briefing this afternoon. "It is    capable of being circumvented through a variety of    strategems." But another official said the measures could    "essentially sever the lifeline that keeps these    organizations going."    ***    A statement issued by three major American Islamic    organizations warned that the initiative could "have a    negative impact on legitimate political expression by    American Muslims and others."    But advocates of the plan said it represented no more than    a first step, even though Administration officials said    they would need to see further evidence that charitable    contributions were being used to support terrorist    operations before the Government would seek to block    operations by Muslim and Islamic groups active in raising    money in the United States.    Administration officials say that much of that money is    used for legitimate purposes in building mosques, providing    food and milk and otherwise helping Palestinian communities    like the ones in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.    But State Department officials have said that millions of    dollars a year from the United States ends up in the hands    of militants in the Hamas organizatlon, whose total    spending is estlmated by Israeli officlals at $30 million    a year and they said a test of the initiative would be    whether it could cut back that flow.    For now, the names of groups and individuals whose assets    are to be frozen or blocked unaer Mr. Clinton's order reads    like a who's who list of organzations and people identified    as terrorists.    In addition to Hamas and Islamic Holy War, they include the    Palestine Liberation Front and its leader, Mohammed Abul    Abbas -- also known as Abu Abbas --  as well as the two    rival factions of the Popular Front for the Liberation of    Palestine.    The list also includes two militant Jewish organizations,    Kach and Kahane Chai, which were spawned by Rabbi Meir    Kahane and were outlawed by Israel early last year.    The authority that Mr. Clinton invoked today in blocking    the assets is provided to the President under the    International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which was used    by President Carter to freeze Iranian assets when Americans    were being held hostage in Teheran.    But the White House made clear that Mr. Clinton intended to    ask Congress soon for even more sweeping authority to curb    terrorism, including wider powers to use wiretapping and    swift deportation procedures against suspects.    ----------    End    The New York Times    January 25, 1995, p.

But he was not promoted to the title of assistant    director, the rank normally given to the agency's top    manager in New York, one of the agency's most prestigious    assignments.    An agent and supervisor for 27 years, Mr. Gavin was in    charge of the investigations that led to the convictions of    four men for the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and    the indictments of 12 other men accused of plotting to blow    up the trade center and other New York Iandmarks. The 12    defendants are currently on trial in Federal District Court    in Manhattan.    Law-enforcement officials said yesterday that James    Kallstrom, a supervisory agent in New York, was considered    the most likely candidate to be chosen by Mr. Freeh to take    over the office. Mr. Kallstrom is now in charge of special    operations, the unit responsible for the surveillance and    the electronic monitoring of criminal suspects.    ----------    End

C17    Books of the Times    Kids or Conspirators: How Hackers Got Caught    MASTERS OF DECEPTION     The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace    By Michelle Slatalla and Joshua Quittner     225 pages. HarperCollins Publishers. $23.    By Chirstopher Lehmann-Haupt    It's difficult to feel much besides amused admiration for    the computer hackers spotlighted in "Masters of Deception:    The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace," by Michelle Slatalla and    Joshua Quittner, a married couple who are reporters for    Newsday. After all, what mainly characterizes the gang of    adolescents they write about is high intelligence, infinite    resourcefulness and boundless curiosity.    Among the Masters of Deception, as the gang is called,    there is Paul Stira, nicknamed Scorpion, who as a child    learned to program a computer even before he had his hands    on one and went on to master the art of cracking    computer-game copy-protection codes. Mark Abene, a k a    Phiber Optik, was so driven to understand how machines work    that he explored and mastered the most sophisticated of the    telephone company's computers.    Eli Landopoulos, or Acid Phreak, after helping lure Phiber    Optik away from a rival cyberspace gang, Legion of Doom,    was moved to write "The History of MOD" for other hackers    to envy. And John Lee, or Corrupt, found computer hacking    a better way to survive than running with a street gang.    It is difficult for the reader of this book to look upon    these and other members of the gang as criminals. Yet they    were eventually charged by a New York grand jury with    conspiring to "gain access to and control of computer    systems in order to enhance their image and prestige among    computer hackers," among other counts. And they ended up    pleading guilty and serving jail terms, which they have    completed.    In telling their stories, Ms. Slatalla and Mr. Quittner    have almost as hard a time finding a continuous thread as    the Government did building a coherent case against the    hackers. The authors begin by describing a crash of the    AT&T long-distance system that occurred on Jan. 15 1990.    The authors write of the gang's reaction to this crisis:    "No self-re-specting computer hacker would ever destroy    anything. No hacker would ever purposely hurt the phone    system. Paul just wanted to look around. He just wanted to    learn more. He'd know it if he'd done something bad.    Wouldn't he?"    The lively narrative then backtracks to tell how the    hackers formed their gang the previous year. This sequence    creates the impression that the gang will turn out to have    caused the crash, an expectation that is buttressed by    other evidence that Ms. Slatalla and Mr. Quittner describe.    The boys crashed smaller systems they invaded, like the    Learning Link, a collection of electronic bulletin boards    for educators and librarians that is owned by Channel    13/WNET, New York City's public broadcasting television    station.    The gang left the message "Happy Thanksgiving you turkeys,    from all of us at MOD," which prevented access to the    bulletin board's files. As the authors write, "the Learning    Link crash would become the pivotal event in the case that    the Federal Government was slowly building against the boys    in MOD." The process was slow because the investigators had    to weigh the need for evidence against the risk of damage.    As the authors write: "It was kind of like having a    tarantula crawl up your leg. If you shook it off too fast,    it would escape into the wall. But if you waited too long,    you got bitten."    But when, about half way through the book, the narrative    arrives back at the AT&T crash of 1990, we learn that the    failure was traced not to anything the hackers did but to    what the author's describe as "a routine update of the AT&T    software." True the gang did much that was wrong like    creating and using unbillable telephone accounts,    trespassing in cyberspace to make long-distance calls,    looking up private information and using it to harass other    hackers and stealing and selling other people's credit card    numbers.    In short, certain members crossed the line between hacking    and cracking and thereby violated the hacker ethic, which    holds, in the authors' words: "Thou shalt not destroy. It's    O.K. to look around, but don't hurt anything. It's good    enough just to be here."    Yet the fact remains that the gang did not cause the AT&T    crash. And the worst that was done appears to have happened    at a remove from what Mr. Abene was responsible for and    after Mr. Stira had more or less withdrawn from hacking.    Yet these two received the stiffest sentences. Mr. Abene,    the last to complete his sentence, was released in the fall    of last year. So one has the impression that what mattered    to the Government was less the mischief done than the    potential for mischief.    What the slightly jumbled narrative does capture    effectively is the contrast between the manic glee of the    hackers at the prospect of a vast new unexplored world to    conquer, and the Government's nervous disapproval and    understandable need to set limits on a mysterious new    frontier. The authors try to present both points of view.    They don't reveal where their sympathies lie until the last    line of their book. Here, after describing the meeting of    a hackers' club as "the milling clumps of boys" who "are    the picture of entropy, of disorganization, of isolated    growing pains and undeveloped social skill," they write    with tongue in cheek as their concluding paragraph:    "This is the conspiracy."

On this I was of course totally wrong:
Unix has symbolic debugging equal to DOS/Windows.
I was under the false impression that it only had
C code interpretation.
This is an error -- what I said was true for C++, but then in Windows we too are forced to primarily use
interpretation to debug C++.   C++ symbolic debuggers
are not up to acceptable capabilities in either system.
But my statement concerning internationalization and
resource files was correct.
Unix has no equivalent of App Studio, etc.  I have made
a little tour of people in my company who work on both
unix and Windows.  I (fortunately) work primarily on
Windows, as you may have guessed.
The company I presently work for is making a tool they
call Window Painter.  This is in some respects similar
to App Studio.  It works with their unix database But it is no App Studio, as the unix folk who are
working on it freely admit, those few of them that
have used App Studio.
Most of my correspondents had replies along the lines
of "Huh -- internationalization -- what source code
tools could possibly help you with internationalization."
Others listed irregular bands of random unix tools which
are essentially irrelevant to the problem of Most international unix programs have string files
that the compiled program refers to a string by a number, and
a font size by a number, and the position of the button
on screen by a number -- site customizable information,
Xdefaults, *.cfg
This is functionally equivalent to the Windows Resource
file, in that in principle one can keep translatable elements
separate from source code.  But is certainly not equivalent in ease of use.  One can do the job, but in essense one
does it by hand.
Resource files, and dialog box editing tools such as App Studio,
provide a clean separation between visual user interface
elements that typically require translation, and functiona
code that does not.

For email copy send blank message with subject:  TSU_shi Here's an excerpt:    Mr. Shimomura, one of the country's most skilled computer    security experts, is the person who prompted a Government    computer agency to issue a chilling warning on Monday.    Unknown intruders, the agency warned, had used a    sophisticated break-in technique to steal files from Mr.    Shimomura's own well-guarded computer in his home near San    Diego. And the stealth and style of the attack indicated    that many of the millions of computers connected to the    global Internet network could be at risk. There have been    at least four other known victims so far, including    computers at Loyola University of Chicago, the University    of Rochester and Drexel University in Philadelphia.    Since Monday, as the F.B.I. has continued to investigate    the crime and look for evidence of break-ins elsewhere, Mr.    Shimomura has been answering telephone calls and E-mail    from government, corporate and university computer    administrators seeking advice on how to arm themselves.    Between replies, he has been working feverishly to perfect    a new type of protective software that would thwart the    burglars. Once it is finished, he intends to distribute the    software free over the Internet.    But more than anything else, Mr. Shimomura, who is 30,    wants to help the Government catch the crooks. And while he    acknowledges that the thieves were clever, Mr. Shimomura    has also uncovered signs of ineptitude that he says will be    the intruders' eventual undoing.    "Looks like the ankle-biters have learned to read technical    manuals," Mr. Shimomura said derisively. "Somebody should    teach them some manners. "

@_subject: NYT on Fermat Proof 
A long article (16k) today on Dr. Andrew Wiles's dramatic, successful
struggle to close the gap in his proof of Fermat's last theorem. For email copy send blank message to  with subject: FERM_hak Here are excerpts:    Fermat's last theorem which has tantalized mathematicians    for more than 350 years, has at last been solved, say those    who have read the revised but not yet published proof. But    the endgame of this furious chase has proved as full of    last-minute surprises as a murder mytery.    For Dr. Andrew Wiles of Princeton University, the chief    author of the proof, triumph had to be snatched from the    jaws of disaster. His first proof, which aroused world-wide    attention when announced two years ago, turned out to    contain a gap, which Dr. Wiles found he was unable to cross    alone.    ***    But he went back to the Flach method for one last time.    "There was one variant in the original argument that I'd    convinced myself wouldn't work but I hadn't convinced him,"    Dr. Wiles said. "I was sitting at my desk one morning    really trying to pin down why the Flach method wasn't    working when, in a flash, I saw that what was making it not    work was exactly what would make a method I'd tried three    years before work. It was totally unexpected. I didn't    quite believe it." He dashed down from the attic to tell    his wife. Although his enthusiasm was infectious, Dr. Wiles    said, " I actually think she didn't believe me."    ***    Dr. Wiles said that the breakthrough came in figuring out    how to glue together an infinite collection of mathematical    objects called Hecke rings. He had initially been creating    what was "a very natural relationship between these objects    -- natural in the sense that you can give a clear    definition of the maps between them." It was an inductive    argument. The idea was to take one element of a set and use    that to find the next element, then to use the second to    construct a third, and so on.    The new idea, Dr. Wiles said, "was to simply construct    artificial maps between these objects."    "You wouldn't show a relationship explicitly," he said, but    would use a counting argument to prove that a relationship    had to exist. The basic idea is to use the pigeonhole    principle: if you have more objects than pigeonholes to put    them in, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more    than one object.    The complete argument involves creating an infinite    sequence of sets of pigeonholes and then showing that there    must be objects that show up in every set of pigeonholes.    This allowed.Dr. Wiles and Dr. Taylor to prove that there    must be an infinite set of Hecke rings that share a    relationship, although they never have to specify exactly    what that relationship is.

@_subject: NYT on Jihad 
The New York Times
   February 3, 1995, p. A19
   [Column] On My Mind
   A. M. Rosenthal
   Jihad in America
   The Clinton Administration has come to two major
   conclusions about terrorism in America, and from America.
   The first is that the United States is becoming a
   national safe haven for terrorists from the Middle East:
   a combination bank, fund-raiser, militarist training
   ground, recruitment center, political academy and
   embarkation dock.
   Second conclusion: Do something. So one recent night,
   instructions from Washington went out to banks nationwide
   to freeze the funds of the various Hamas Hezbollah and
   Islamic Jihad units, and their clones, operating from the
   East Coast to Texas and California. Mr. Clinton did that
   by Presidential order.
   Now the Administration is asking Congress to pass new
   anti-terrorist legislation. It would enable the
   Government to trace funds to and from the
   terrorist-supporting groups, tighten the definition of
   terrorism, enlarge the powers of Federal attorneys to
   deal with it and make it illegal to plan or train for
   terrorism abroad as well as in the U.S.
   The draft legislation is called the Omnibus
   Counterterrorism Act of 1995. It was drawn up by the
   Department of Justice on Presidential order and will be
   introduced in Congress in a matter of days.
   For Americans who have been warning about terrorism
   operating in and out of America, the time to relax has
   hardly arrived. We will see how effective it is in ending
   the contribution to terrorism of American laws and
   American inattention.
   But the fact is that the Clinton Administration has begun
   to pay more attention to the growth of terrorist
   organizations here than its predecessors have. And in
   parts of the government intelligence machinery, the
   assessment of the danger of terrorism originating in
   America is strong enough to surprise even anti-terrorism
   alarm ringers like myself.
   In large part, the awakening can be credited to the
   terrorists themselves. Even for America, blowing up the
   World Trade Center was a little thick.
   But the next time you get all worked up about the
   dastardly press, do remember that in the matter of
   terrorism, as so many others, it was an American
   journalist whose skill, determination and risk-taking
   (physical and professional) helped shake government
   awake.
   On Nov. 21, 1994, PBS presented "Jihad in America." The
   documentary laid it all out on film -- the meetings in
   American cities where the cry of holy war went up against
   America, Christians, Jews and Muslims who would not
   surrender to fundamentalism; the training; the visits to
   American units by Middle Eastern leaders of Hamas and
   Islamic Jihad, and the fund-raising structure that
   supported terrorism.
   The executive producer was Steven Emerson, an
   investigator of terrorism who has turned out a strong
   body of work in film, books and print journalism. Among
   government officials I talked to, credit for Mr. Emerson
   was not only acknowledged but volunteered.
   Democracy often has a tough time defending itself because
   it has to operate step by step, inch by inch, under the
   law. Yes, of course, that is democracy's blessing and
   strength.
   But nothing says a democracy has to watch the bombers
   come racing in their trucks and pretend they are
   bicyclists out for a ride in the park. Laurie Mylroie,
   the U.S. expert on Iraq who wrote a fine best seller on
   Saddam Hussein with Judith Miller, has written another
   book, focusing on the question of an Iraqi role in the
   bombing. It deserves to be published wide and soon.
   The Emerson documentary brought protests from American
   Muslim groups. So will the new legislation. Immediately,
   non-Muslims nod sypathetically and think, well, it's
   understandable Muslims will be upset. I almost did
   myself. But why? Christians are not expected to complain
   about denunciation of Christian Fascists. Jews around the
   world led the protests of the massacre at the mosque in
   Hebron and Jews generally did not protest the President's
   freezing of funds of two extremist Jewish groups.
   The assumption that all Muslims must be angry at action
   against Muslim terrorists strengthens the killers. It
   demeans the intelligence of all Muslims. And, as for the
   hundreds of thousands of Muslim victims who died under
   Muslim state tyranny or Muslim state-supported terrorism,
   it spits on their graves.

Forwarding mail by: gleick (James Gleick) on Fri, 10 Feb  0:12 AM
Dear Pipeliners,
I'm pleased to be able to tell you that the Pipeline has become part of  a larger enterprise: Performance Systems International (PSINet), the  nation's leading Internet access provider.
That means two things immediately. First, PSINet has a state-of-the-art dialup network in many cities  across the nation, and these will shortly be available to our users at  a cost much less than our current out-of-town SprintNet surcharges.
Second, PSINet plans to use our Internaut software as the basis for a  national service--not to replace the New York-based Pipeline but to  provide an alternative for out-of-towners who don't especially care  about New York information and services.
PSINet is a company a lot like ours--small (though not so small  anymore), enthusiastic, fast-moving, and steeped in Internet history.  The people there care about the Internet as an environment worth  preserving even as it grows so explosively.  And they admire what we've  accomplished here at the Pipeline in forming a model online service.
That's enough for now--there will be more information following along  behind, but I wanted you to hear it here first.  As for me--this isn't  goodbye, exactly, but I have gotten a little behind on a book I was  supposed to be writing . . .
I am deeply grateful to all of you--staff and customers--for making  the Pipeline what it is and for letting me get to know you a little bit.

The NY Times report today on the near miss of "terrorist mastermind" Yousef in Manila after a kitchen blaze of cooking-up explosives, says that he was seen walking rapidly away talking on a cellular phone.
Allegedly left behind on a laptop was a disk "filled with details of his plots to kill Pope John Paul II, and to blow up American jets flying in the Far East."
Twenty (20) FBI agents were sent to pick him up in Islamabad, Pakistan for safe home in the New York.
A concerned citizen may ask:
What was picked up from the phone, or will be affidavited to have been picked up.
What was on the disk, or will be solemnly sworn to have been found on the disk.
And, finally, what armament and intergalatic technology accompanied the SWAT team -- over and back, to provide full cloak and security on land, sea and air?  And, with that show as spoof, how was he really imported?  How many other fake transports were set in motion?
When will we learn more of the lurid Clancy-juicy details of this black-op budget-busting crowd-pleaser?
Is this a laptop dog and pony?  No offense to Fifi and Holy Bull and Apple.

   "U.S. Tells How It Found Soviets Sought A-Bomb: Discloses
   Clues That Led to Code-Breaking."
      The American intelligence establishment today unveiled
      one of its oldest secrets: how a small team of
      codebreakers found the first clues that the Soviet Union
      sought to steal the blueprints for the atomic bomb in
      World War II.  Using just brain power -- no computers,
      no stolen skeleton keys -- the cryptographers slowly
      cracked what was thought to be an unbreakable code.       Their work and the fact that they had broken the
      Soviets' seemingly impenetrable cipher, was until today
      one of the most tightly held secrets of the National
      Security Agency, the nation's electronic eavesdropping
      service.  The messages were like a jigsaw puzzle with a
      billion pieces -- all black. They had been double-coded
      by a system called a one-time pad -- a unique random
      code for each message, converting words to numbers in a

                Administration, Congress Introduce
                  New Computer Crime Legislation
   Washington, D.C. -- Attorney General Janet Reno today
   announced that the Clinton Administration, along with
   Senators John Kyl, Patrick Leahy, and Charles Grassley has
   introduced legislation dramatically increasing federal
   protections of data confidentiality.  Current law protects
   the confidentiality of financial information.  Today's
   legislation would protect all government data against
   access without permission, as well as criminalizing access
   by government employees who exceed their authority to gain
   access to government data.
   "As technology advances, computer crime has grown," said
   Reno. "We have to ensure that the law keeps up with
   changing times."
   With the phenomenal growth of legitimate computer use has
   come a similar growth in computer crime and the problem of
   "hackers" who break into computer networks without
   authority to steal information or damage computer systems.    In addition to penetrating telephone networks to disrupt
   phone service and wiretap calls, many hackers attack
   government and private computers to steal valuable
   information.
   According to the Computer Emergency Response Team at
   Carnegie Mellon University, during the past four years, the
   number of reported intrusions on the Internet has increased
   498 percent, and the number of computer sites affected has
   increased 702 percent.
   "Computer crime is fast becoming everyone's problem," said
   Reno. "I'm encouraged that this bill is off to a bipartisan
   start, and I hope Congress will move quickly to enact it."
   The new Act provides three new tools to address this
   problem:
   +  More computers would be protected by federal law.  Under
      the new law, a "protected computer" would be defined as
      any government computer, financial institution computer,
      or any other computer used in interstate or foreign
      commerce or communications.  Under current law,
      computers are not adequately protected from foreign
      hackers, and no federal jurisdiction can be obtained
      when the hacker's and the victim's computers are located
      in the same state.
   +  Under the new law, all government data would be
      protected, and the federal government could prosecute
      individuals who access government data for their own
      use.  Additionally, private data would be protected when
      hackers steal information from computers located across
      state or national borders. Currently, only financial
      data and classified information are strictly protected
      from improper access.
   +  The integrity and availability of data would be better
      protected under the new law because it ensures that all
      hackers are punished adequately.  Current law provides
      penalties for intentional damage, but hackers who
      recklessly or accidently damage information or systems
      face little or no penalties.
                                   95-370

Garry Wills, the historian, writes a thought-provoking essay    The New York Review of Books, August 10, 1995, on "The New
   Revolutionaries," about the militants and the political and
   social grievances that undergird their movement -- many of
   which are shared, Will states, by a wide spectrum of the
   populace discontented with the government:
      The suspicion that government has become the enemy of
      freedom, not its protector, crosses ideological lines.
      Liberals point to FBI plots against American citizens
      like Dr. King, to CIA experiments with LSD on American
      citizens, to the Defense Department's use of Americans
      as guinea pigs in nuclear testing. The right sees
      assaults on liberty from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
      and Firearms, the Department of the Interior, the
      Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Many
      people resent the fact that government has become a
      dictator of the terms of societal conduct -- in welfare
      programs, in affirmative action and other preferential
      attitudes toward citizens' rights, in schools that seem
      to have a "multicultural" or antireligious agenda, in
      confiscatory taxation, in the keeping of elaborate files
      on citizens' activities, in various agencies'
      surveillance techniques and bribing of informers.
   Wills goes on to review these grievances:
      Taxation.
      The jury system.
      Regulations.
      Police power.
      Schools.
      Family.
      Religion.
      Citizen militias.
      Constitutionalism.
      Corruption.
      Guns -- discussed at length.
   And, he summarizes in closing:
      With the end of the cold war, the justification for
      government activism has been taken away. If the
      government is only good for fighting Communists, and it
      no longer fights Communists, then what good is it? No
      convincing answer comes from above -- which lends the
      answer from the depths its new plausibility: It is good
      for nothing, and citizens must take their own lives in
      hand again, vindicating their own liberties. Right or
      wrong, the armed patriots at least have arguments they
      can believe in wholeheartedly. They take the mood of
      post-cold war drift, of Perotista resentment, of
      disillusionment and economic shakiness, of fin de siecle
      fear, and change it into a plan for doing something
      about one's gripes.
      The militias and their supporters are
      not the most central social symptom of our time, but
      they are among the more dramatic symptoms of a general
      crisis of legitimacy. The authority of government can no
      longer be assumed. It has to be justified from the
      ground up.
      Many people who are not militants or conspiratorialists
      can agree with parts of this analysis. Libertarians
      wonder why people who keep to themselves should be
      bothered.
      It is no longer so "extreme" to believe that our
      government is the greatest enemy to freedom. We see this
      in a new hatred of government agents (who fear for their
      lives in western states). Or in the unprecedented
      vilification of the head of our government. The fierce
      contempt for Hillary Rodham Clinton, for the Attorney
      General (called "Butch" Reno on bumper stickers), for
      "Condom Queen" Joycelyn Elders, reflects misogyny
      rebelling against feminism's gains; but it is also a
      sign that the office of the presidency itself may now
      incur a contempt as routine as the respect it once
      commanded. The heaping of filth on the personnel and
      symbols of government has a delegitimating effect in
      itself; and the assault is joined to the disillusion,
      anger, and disorientation that have marked recent
      electoral behavior. Where the heated deny legitimacy and
      the cool are doubtful of it, a crisis is in the making.

The New York Times, July 28, 1995, p. A26.
   [Editorial] Senator Grassley's Surf Police
   An academic study suggesting that the Internet is awash in
   bestiality, pedophilia and other kinky sex turns out to
   have been seriously flawed. Politicians like Senator
   Charles Grassley who waved the study around as an argument
   for intrusive regulation have stopped doing so. But Mr.
   Grassley and his allies have not backed off from their
   drive to draft unnecessary legislative restrictions on
   computer communications. Earlier this summer, Senator James
   Exon attached an amendment to the Senate version of a
   telecommunications bill that would impose Federal penalties
   on those who made available material deemed unsuitable for
   children.
   The unreliable study that did much to spur this bad
   legislating was conducted by Marty Rimm, then an
   undergraduate at Carnegie-Mellon University. It was
   reprinted in the Georgetown Law Journal and served as the
   basis for a credulous Time magazine article early this
   month. Mr. Rimm's academic supervisors have since made
   clear that the study had serious defects. The likelihood
   that children will be accidentally deluged with sexually
   charged computer graphics is much smaller than Mr. Rimm and
   his promoters suggested.
   Furthermore, to the extent that any problem exists, the
   best response is not through heavyhanded, constitutionally
   dubious legislation but parental education and
   discretionary user controls.
   Mr. Rimm's study looked at the computer habits of adults.
   He focused not on generally accessible areas of the
   Internet but on separate, commercial adult bulletin board
   services that require special procedures to find and use.
   This, critics note, is like visiting an adult bookstore and
   using the percentage of gamey titles to generalize about
   the contents of all bookstores. He also looked, less
   carefully, at specialized areas of the Internet that would
   be hard to stumble upon by accident.
   By Mr. Rimm's own calculations, less than 1 percent of all
   material on the Internet itself is raunchy, although this
   tiny percentage is unusually popular among the adults he
   surveyed. Another Carnegie-Mellon study, focusing on
   families with high school children, suggests that sexually
   explicit material is much less popular among these users.
   To be sure, sexually explicit material that would be
   offensive to some users can be found on the Internet. It is
   within the reach of computer-literate children using the
   networks without parental supervision.
   But the problem is being exaggerated to create a pretext
   for restricting the material available to adult users of
   computers. Some members of Congress, out of political greed
   or ignorance, want to censor what can be put on the Net and
   prosecute those who post legal but raunchy material. The
   approaches being advocated by Mr. Exon and Mr. Grassley are
   unwarranted and unconstitutional.
   They are also impractical. Material posted to the Internet
   in foreign countries, beyond the reach of American law, is
   as available to users as domestically posted material.
   Items can also be posted through anonymous mailers that
   make it impossible to identify the original source.
   Censorship would also have the unwelcome effect of
   restricting adults to reading and viewing material deemed
   suitable for children, and would stunt the future of the
   networks as a medium for artistic expression.
   Parents who want to restrict what their children are able
   to call up on their computers can avail themselves of
   software now available on the market that can block out
   unwanted material. Filtering out such material at the user
   end is a more practical, and far less objectionable,
   approach than limiting a nation of computer users to baby
   talk.
   Such devices are not foolproof, of course. The surest
   defense is for parents to try to teach their children the
   kind of healthy values that would make them uninterested
   in, or immune to, sexually exploitative material.

Responding to msg by jlasser (Jon Lasser) on Mon, 31 Jul 12:43 PM
In addition to Doctorow's OpEd piece, there have been three recent NYPaper articles on the case and a half-page ad.
Here's a judicious benchwarmer from the July 30 article:
   Judge Albert F. Sabo of Common Pleas Court, who conducted
   Mr. Abu-Jamal's first contentious trial, is presiding over
   his hearing for a new trial, and defense lawyers contend
   that not much has changed.
   Judge Sabo, a retired member of the Fraternal Order of
   Police, has sent more people to death row than any judge in
   the state. In the current hearing he has been openly
   contemptuous of the defense.
   "Objection is over-ruled, whatever it was," the judge told
   Mr. Abu-Jamal's lead lawyer, Leonard I. Weinglass, a
   veteran of some of the most politically charged trials of
   recent decades, including that of the Chicago Eight after
   the 1968 Democratic Convention.
   Judge Sabo has sustained virtually every prosecution
   objection while shooting down almost every defense
   objection. At one point, when Mr. Weinglass asked for a
   four-minute recess to locate a crucial witness, Judge Sabo,
   looking at his watch, said, "It's ten-twenty-eight-and-a-
   half. You have until 10:30."
   On Wednesday, the first day of the hearing, Judge Sabo
   turned his back and walked out of the courtroom as another
   defense lawyer, Rachel H. Wolkenstein, was addressing him
   about a legal issue. He came back a few minutes later,
   saying that he could not hear because of the noise coming
   from the street, where a large group of Mr. Abu-Jamal's
   supporters were chanting, "Free Mumia now."
   Richard B. Costello, the president of the Philadelphia
   Fraternal Order of Police, said he did not understand why
   Mr. Abu-Jamal's plight had drawn so much attention and big-
   league legal help.
   "He has more lawyers than Snow White had dwarfs," Mr.
   Costello said. "There's nothing special about this guy.
   He's a cop killer. We've had cop killers before, and,
   unfortunately, we'll have them again."
   Although Judge Sabo has frequently urged the defense to
   hurry, he interrupted the proceedings for several minutes
   to argue and reminisce with a baffled witness about the
   location of a swimming pool in his old neighborhood
   sometime around "1926 or '28."
   As he talked about the pool, a woman in the audience jumped
   to her feet and shouted, "Aren't we here to talk about a
   man's life?" She was escorted from the courtroom. Minutes
   later, the judge asked another question about the pool.
   Several of Mr. Abu-Jamal's supporters were removed for
   refusing to stand when Judge Sabo entered and another was
   taken outside for giving the judge a Nazi-style salute.

   "Your Home Computer Will Soon Be Your Banker and Broker."
      The first on-line banking transaction will be a historic
      moment not unlike the first automobile sale or the first
      commercial airline flight. It will signal a commercially
      viable use of a new technology that may ultimately
      eliminate what until now we have considered the retail
      aspects of banking, stock brokerage and more. The
      implications are profound.
      The promise is electronic access to all financial
      transactions at substantially lower cost. One's personal
      computer can, in essence, become an in-home bank branch,
      brokerage outlet and financial planner.
      For example, with Intuit's software and with its union
      with American Express, Smith Barney and 17 large banks,
      consumers will be able use one link for the first time
      to access traditional banking, credit- and charge-card
      services, brokerage services, financial planning and
      more.
      The effect on the banking and brokerage business and
      their employees is going to be profound. The retail
      sales forces of banks and brokerage houses may shrink
      substantially, as may the ranks of financial planners.
      The number of bank and brokerage buildings may also
      shrink.

      The Federal Aviation Administration yesterday awarded a
      contract to greatly improve a navigation system that
      would let civilians pinpoint their locations anywhere in
      the United States to within 21 feet.
      The augmentation would consist of 36 receiving stations
      in the United States, each fixed in a precisely surveyed
      spot. Each station would listen electronically for the
      signals given off by the halo of satellites, and
      calculate what the satellites were saying about the
      station's location. But the station, bolted down, would
      not rely on the satellites to determine its location; it
      would already know that precisely.
      The central office, listening to all 36 stations, would
      establish a correction factor. It would radio the
      correction factor to a different satellite, one in
      geosynchronous orbit over the United States, meaning
      that its position did not change relative to the earth's
      surface.
      The geosynchronous satellite would radio a correction
      factor back to planes in flight, or any other user. The
      plane would also receive signals from the G.P.S.
      satellites, calculate a position, apply the correction
      factor and fix its location.

   "Spies Unlike Us: A history of French intelligence reveals
   a far more brutal approach than this country's."
      The aftermath of 1945 imposed an additional heavy burden
      on the French secret services. Political allegiances
      were exacerbated by the presence of a potential huge
      Communist fifth column in France. The rough lessons of
      the war led to a premium on "service action" operations
      of sabotage and assassination before which Britain's
      M.I.6 would have quailed. Mr. Porch sees the French
      secret services of today as still not having recovered
      from their politicization during World War II. During

      coming years with lasting social, cultural and political
      effects. Mr. Slouka foresees a sinister new world in

I respect the view that sound crypto requires skeptical

   or die by the same process. Crypto would die if there was
   no belief in conspiracies.
   Conspiracy theory drives the cypherpunk agenda, I surmised
   from the welcoming statement. Note the caution about "S1,"
   and any other crypto offering.
   Perry's sharp statements on the urgent need for crypto
   deployment are motivated, it seems to me, by a view of a
   believable, if not wholly proveable, threat that crypto is
   believed to counter. I choose to believe him; Orlin's got my
   skeptical interest -- put up or shut up -- and he's not out of line.
   But who knows more than what we read in the conspiracy-
   driven media and hear from our respected leaders?
   Take your pick of them, or believe your own home-grown,

@_subject: Re: \"S1\" encryption system 
Is it possible that there are multiple levels of encryption
   included in the "S1" algorithm?
   This question is prompted by reviewing the DoD's Multilevel
   Security (MLS) Program at:
         One of the features of this program is to design means to
   simultaneously transmit data with different levels of
   security, so that communicants send and/or read the data
   according to their levels of security clearance. This is
   amplified in Section 3 of the program description at:
         Excerpts:
      Multilevel security allows information systems to
      provide capabilities that augment its existing
      single-level data processing and data communications
      services. Data of multiple security levels are        processed and transferred by the system, which also
      separates the different security levels and controls
      access to the data. ...
      When a system operates in the multilevel mode, it allows
      data of two or more security levels to be processed
      simultaneously when not all users have the clearance,
      formal authorization, or need to know for all data
      handled by the system. The system is able to separate
      and protect the data according to these restrictions.
      To amplify the definition, an MLS system might process
      both Secret and Top Secret collateral data and have some
      users whose maximum clearance is Secret and others whose
      maximum clearance is Top Secret. Another MLS system
      might have all its users cleared at the Top Secret
      level, but have the ability to release information
      classified as Secret to a network consisting of only
      Secret users and systems. Still another system might
      process both Secret and Unclassified information and
      have some users with no clearance. In each of these
      instances, the system must implement mechanisms to
      provide assurance that the system's security policy is
      strictly enforced. In these examples, the policy        allows access to the data by only those users who are
      appropriately cleared and authorized (e.g., having
      formal access approval) and who have an official need to
      know for the data.
      A related mode of operation is the partitioned mode,
      also known as compartmented mode. Although similar
      concepts and solutions are involved for compartmented
      mode operations as are for the multilevel mode, there is
      also a key difference. In the compartmented mode, all
      users have clearances for all the data processed but may
      not have authorizations for all the data; whereas for
      multilevel mode, some users may not even be cleared for
      the highest level. Because the compartmented mode is
      often envisioned for the intelligence community, all
      such users would have Top Secret security clearances and
      often authorizations for one or more, but possibly not
      all, compartments in the system.
   End excerpts.
   There are also descriptions of the soft and hardware
   implementations of MLS.
   Would anyone care to comment on how this differentiation of
   levels of security is done, by a single encryption program
   or multiples, and if multiples, their arrangement? Is
   feature then embedded in the hardware, such as the Fortezza
   card system cited in the program?

   "Bigger Than the Family, Smaller Than the State: Are
   voluntary groups what make countries work?" [Book review]
      Mr. Fukuyama has shifted his attention from the state to
      society; the result is a fascinating and frustrating
      book, "Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of
      Prosperity." We have settled on the structure of the
      state, he writes, but "liberal political and economic
      institutions depend on a healthy and dynamic civil
      society for their vitality."
      In the world of ideas, civil society is hot. It is
      almost impossible to read an article on foreign or
      domestic politics without coming across some mention of
      the concept. And "civil society" has bipartisan appeal;
      from Hillary Rodham Clinton to Pat Buchanan, politicians
      of all stripes routinely sing its praises.
      Behind much of the new interest in civil society, on the
      part of communitarians as well as social conservatives,
      is the idea that culture and society shape the nature of
      government. But the space between the realm of
      government and that of the family can be filled with all
      kinds of associations, liberal and illiberal. Historians
      have amply laid out how the Nazi Party made its first
      inroads through infiltrating local groups. On a less
      extreme note, many of the small groups that have formed
      in America over the last two decades have been
      thoroughly illiberal in spirit: victims' groups that
      have discouraged individual responsibility, minority
      clubs that have Balkanized the campus and the workplace,
      pseudoreligious cults with violent agendas. Not all of
      civil society is civic minded.
      A report on Timothy J. McVeigh's civil life noted that
      Mr. McVeigh and Terry and James Nichols, would go
      bowling and plan their future. But perhaps we would all
      have been better off if Mr. McVeigh had gone bowling
      alone.

This seems worth posting in full:
   The New York Times, August 14, 1995, pp. D1, D8.
   Rift Emerges Over Computer Data Secrecy Issue
   By John Markoff
   Some of biggest names in the computer industry sent
   separate letters to the White House last week in
   pre-emptive moves aimed at a proposed regulation originally
   intended to insure that law-enforcement officials have
   access to encoded telephone and computer communications.
   The proposal may be released as soon as this week.
   But as the Government's task force on the encryption issue
   prepared to disclose the closely held details of the
   proposal -- the latest version of a measure revealed more
   than three years ago but subsequently reconsidered in the
   face of industry opposition -- unexpected divisions emerged
   from the last-minute, scattershot lobbying.
   The splits are developing at a crucial moment, with the
   Government's interagency task force also apparently divided
   between those favoring maximum governmental access to
   communications and those who support a loosening of export
   restrictions. Most industry executives had hoped to present
   a united front in favor of the more liberal position -- a
   goal that now appears to be in jeopardy.
   The two major groups sending letters to Vice President Al
   Gore, the Administration's point man on technology issues,
   were a group of computer hardware manufacturers and a group
   of the largest makers of software.
   In a letter sent to the Vice President last Thursday, eight
   executives, including James Treybig, chairman of Tandem
   Computers Inc.; Gil F. Amelio, chairman of the National
   Semiconductor Corporation; Edward McCracken, chairman of
   Silicon Graphics Inc.; Eugene Shanks Jr. president of the
   Bankers Trust New York Corporation, which conducts
   international electronic commerce, and Stephen T. Walker,
   chairman of Trusted Information Systems, urged that the
   Government immediately establish a new standard to control
   the export of technology that is used to encode
   communications, so that outsiders cannot tap in.
   A day later, however, a group of software publishers,
   including William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft
   Corporation; Jim P. Manzi, president of the Lotus
   Development Corporation and a senior vice president of
   I.B.M., Robert Frankenberg, chairman of Novell Inc.; Mark
   B. Hoffman, chairman of Sybase Inc., and Carol Bartz,
   chairwoman of Autodesk Inc., wrote arguing that the
   possible restrictive regulations that may soon be offered
   by the Government would fail to remove the current
   obstacles that keep American companies from competing in
   lucrative international markets.
   Many off-the-shelf programs cannot be marketed abroad
   without alteration under current regulations. For example,
   before American publishers can sell the popular Lotus Notes
   program abroad, they must replace its encoding system with
   a weakened version so that foreign communications can be
   monitored by American intelligence agencies. These
   restrictions date to the 1970's when advanced computer
   technology was treated as the equivalent of military
   technology and subject to the same strict controls.
   The software publishers have been able to sell their highly
   effective communications encoding products in this country,
   while sales abroad, they contend, have been hurt. Their
   letter also said that although the Administration agreed
   last year to work with industry toward a compromise, "there
   has been only minimal consultation with the software
   industry with respect to basic questions."
   "We're worried the Government is about to announce the son
   of Clipper," said Robert W. Holleyman 2d, president of the
   Business Software Alliance, referring to the Government's
   original proposal for changing the standard. This proposal,
   released in April 1993, would have replaced the cold
   war-era restrictions with a coding standard that allowed
   sales of strong encryption programs, but would have given
   United States law-enforcement agencies access to all
   communications through a back door with a numerical key.
   "The Administration has been trying to resolve how to keep
   U.S. companies competitive, but there remain individuals in
   the Government who want to do anything they can to slow the
   proliferation of new encryption technologies," Mr.
   Holleyman said.
   In April 1992, the Administration proposed a hardware-based
   system for protecting the privacy of telephone calls and
   computer data transmissions. The standard, known as the
   Clipper Chip, included a special "backdoor" that would
   permit law-enforcement officials to listen to conversations
   and monitor data exchanges.
   The original Clipper system called for a two-part key for
   decoding scrambled conversations. The two parts of the key
   -- actually two large numbers -- were to be held by two
   independent Government agencies. Under the plan, when a
   law-enforcement agency had a warrant to listen to a
   conversation encoded by Clipper, it would obtain the keys
   from the separate agencies. By merging the keys, it could
   obtain a key that would unlock the coded conversation.
   The Clipper proposal met with angry opposition both from
   advocates for civil liberties, who argued it would
   undermine the right to privacy, and by high-technology
   executives who said Clipper would be unacceptable for
   foreign users who would not want their conversations to be
   readable by the United States Government.
   The announcement of the new proposal may be imminent. Two
   trade associations, the Software Publishers Association and
   the American Electronic Association, are planning a
   conference on cryptography policy for Friday.
   Several people familiar with Administration policy
   discussions said the Government had until recently remained
   divided and that the director of the Federal Bureau of
   Investigation, Louis J. Freeh, has been the most vocal
   advocate of placing strict limits on any use of
   unsanctioned encryption technology.
   After the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City,
   the F.B.I., circulated a proposed antiterrorism bill on
   Capitol Hill that would have banned even the domestic use
   of coding software except for systems approved by the
   Government.

A couple of cryptoids from PC Mag, 9-12-95:
   [Review excerpts] *Network Security, Private Communication    a Public World*, review by O. Ryan Tabibian
   The book is grouped into three parts: "Cryptography,'
   "Authentication," and "Electronic Mail." There is also a
   "Leftover" section, which covers security with popular
   network operating systems such as Microsoft Windows NT and
   NetWare.
   Most books fail to cover the difficult subject of
   cryptography effectively. *Network Security*, however,
   clearly describes the different cryptography methods --
   such as secret key, hashing, and public-key cryptography --
   as well as a variety of other technologies, including
   Diffie-Hellman and RSA.
   The second section, "Authentication," deals with how a
   system or persons you are communicating with can verify
   your identity. Verification schemes range from simple
   passwords to complex digital signatures. The authors do a
   remarkable job of describing and analyzing the variety of
   authentication methods.
   Since the majority of your access to the outside world is
   through e-mail, your messages are probably most vulnerable.
   The book covers some of the popular e-mail security
   schemes, such as public key and privacyenhanced mail. A
   brief overview of X.400 is also included.
   Overall this is perhaps the most comprehensive, yet
   easiest-to-understand book covering network security
   available.

   [Then, Bill Machrone muses on the utility of an electronic
   business cards. Excerpts:]
   Some of my correspondents want a magnetic stripe on the
   business card, pretty much like the one on your credit
   cards. Others want a bar code. Assuming that you don't use
   the back of your card for an alternative language, you've
   got several square inches back there, plenty of room for
   data.
   What will we use it for? The database stuff is the easy and
   obvious part. Since the computer industry and IS
   departments are likely to be the earliest adopters, it
   would be a simple matter to standardize on a format that
   the reader spits out for easy importation into just about
   anything. If the software and I/O devices are cheap enough,
   the rest of the world will come along -- and benefit.
   Authentication is a potentially huge application. In some
   South American countries, fraudulent representation is
   common. Crooks collect business cards from legitimate
   businesspeople and then misrepresent themselves to
   perpetrate a variety of scams. As a result, businesspeople
   commonly tear a corner of their card as they hand it to
   you. You don't trust a card that wasn't torn in front of
   you.
   A more elegant solution lies in a new Kodak technology that
   can encode your likeness in as little as 500 bytes,
   readable by your PDA, notebook, or desktop machines. You
   could also include a machine-readable version of your
   public encryption key, making it easy for people to send
   you secure communications.

   French Hacker Cracks Netscape Code, Shrugging Off U.S.
   Encryption Scheme
   By Jared Sandberg
   A computer hacker in France has breached the encryption
   scheme of new Netscape software for navigating the
   Internet, the global computer network. The breach
   underscores flaws in U.S. rules restricting the export of
   more-sophisticated security measures.
   The hacker, a French student at the Ecole Polytechnique,
   cracked the weaker encryption scheme that U.S. government
   policy forces Netscape Communications Corp. to use in a
   foreign version of its Navigator software. Yesterday, he
   posted the results of his efforts on the Internet's
   Cypherpunks discussion group.
   The student took up a challenge issued on July 14 in the
   Cypherpunks group, which is frequented by cryptography
   experts and hackers and mathematicians. He used 120
   powerful computer workstations and two supercomputers to
   crack a piece of information encrypted in Netscape's
   "browser" software. The security is aimed at scrambling
   sensitive financial data to keep credit-card numbers, sales
   transactions and other material safe from breakms.
   The highly sophisticated computers took eight days to break
   the code -- far more power and time than the typical
   illegal hacker would be able to muster for criminal
   pursuits. But the chore nonetheless highlights the
   vulnerabilities that could make customers shy away from
   conducting commerce on the Internet, particularly
   international users who can't get hold of the tougher
   security measures allowed within the U.S.
   The French hacker was able to crack the so-called 40-bit
   encryption scheme in Netscape's overseas version of its
   software. In the U.S., Netscape employs a far more powerful
   design -- 128 bits, a number that refers to length of the
   encoding "key," which is used to scramble data.
   U.S. rules limit Netscape to exporting only 40-bit
   encryption overseas. Yet the 128-bit version takes
   exponentially more power to crack: Compared with violating
   the 40-bit scheme, the 128-bit key would take
   10-to-the-26th-power more time to breach, experts say.
   That's a 1 followed by 26 zeroes, a factor of time that
   makes it all but impossible for hackers to break in.
   Netscape wasn't surprised at the findings. The company said
   it has always known and stated that 40-bit security could
   be breached by "brute force," the use of massive computing
   power to descramble the information.
   "This is a good indication of why the government should
   allow us to ship more secure software," said Mike Homer,
   Netscape's vice president of marketing. "The laws are
   archaic."
   Clinton administration officials have viewed strong
   encryption as a weapon for foreign terrorists, who could
   exchange communications without fear of eavesdropping by
   law enforcement officials.
   That policy, however, has raised the hackles of industry
   executives, who say that without strong encryption abroad,
   the growth of electronic commerce could be significantly
   stunted. Last week, a group of software executives told the
   White House that restrictive export regulations might blunt
   American competitiveness in foreign markets.
   "Netscape security is fine," said Dietrich Cappe, a senior
   partner at Red Planet LLC, an Internet consulting company.
   "As long as the government's export restriction exists,
   commerce is going to be severely hampered." Netscape
   licenses the encryption algorithm from RSA Data Security
   Inc., one of the most prominent software security firms
   that licenses its software to most major software
   companies. "We've warned the government that the level of
   security they allow our customers to export is too weak,"
   said James Bidzos, president of RSA. "Maybe they'll listen
   now."
   Netscape's Mr. Homer noted, however, that the amount of
   effort and computing power, which could cost as much as
   $10,000 in addition to the cost of the machines, don't make
   even breaches of 40-bit security practical from a thief's
   perspective.
   "You'd be better off working in a shoe store, stealing
   credit card numbers for a week." Mr. Homer said.

      The profit on credit card operations is almost five

       "We're in a state of chaos," said Stephan Seidman, the

   U.S. to Urge A New Policy On Software
   Affempt at Compromise On Scrambling of Data
   By John Markoff
   The Clinton Administration broke a year of silence on its
   data-scrambling policy yesterday by saying it would soon
   propose an alternative to the Government's so-called Clipper
   Chip system, which has been widely criticized by makers and
   users of computer technology.
   The Administration announcement is an attempt to reach a
   compromise with American corporations on a software coding
   system that would protect the privacy of communication over
   computer networks while still permitting court-authorized
   wiretaps and eavesdropping by law enforcement officials.
   Critics of the Clipper Chip have opposed it because the
   Government refused to allow public examination of the
   underlying technology to make sure there were no secret
   backdoors that might allow unauthorized spying.
   Privacy-rights advocates attacked the policy because it
   called for a Government agency to hold a numeric key to
   each user's code. And technology executives have opposed
   the Government's data-scrambling policy because it
   restricts export of other types of data-security systems,
   which is seen as an impediment to sales of American
   computer products overseas.
   Officials of the Commerce Department's National Institute
   of Standards and Technology, which administers the data-
   scrambling standard, said yesterday that the Government
   would convene a workshop on Sept. 6 and 7 to discuss the
   new proposal. The topics include a proposal to relax the
   export policy and discussion of an alternative to Clipper
   technology that would be more palatable to industry
   executives.
   Industry officials had written two weeks ago to Vice
   President Al Gore, calling for resumption of talks that had
   broken off last year. In the talks last year industry
   leaders had met with Government officials to seek Clipper
   Chip alternatives.
   "I think that moving ahead with industry dialogue is
   positive," Robert W. Holleyman 2d, president of the
   Business Software Alliance, said yesterday. The alliance is
   a group of the industry's largest software companies,
   including Microsoft, Lotus and Novell. "But much more needs
   to be fleshed out," Mr. Holleyman said.
   One big criticism of the Clipper policy was the proviso
   that a Government agency would hold, in escrow, a decoding
   key that law-enforcement officials could obtain after
   receiving a court's authorization. The new proposal would
   still include a provision for holding keys in escrow, but
   Government officials said they were now willing to discuss
   letting non-Government escrow agents hold the keys.
   Later in September, the Government will hold a second
   workshop to discuss Federal standards for software coding
   systems that could then be used as an alternative to
   Clipper and a related technology called Capstone. In an
   attempt to establish Clipper and Capstone as de-facto
   industry standards, the original policy mandated that
   computer and communications systems sold to the Federal
   Government must contain Clipper or Capstone hardware.
   But the new approach might allow computer and
   communications companies to sell products to the Government
   that achieved the same privacy protection through software-
   only means. That would relieve companies doing business
   with the Government of the obligation to invest in Clipper
   and Capstone technologies that might not find buyers in the
   commercial marketplace.
   Another criticism of the Government s policy has been its
   longstanding export rules, which have put strict limits on
   the export of software containing data-encoding
   capabilities. The assumption has been that the Government's
   electronic spies, the National Security Agency, would be
   able to break codes with keys of 40 bits or shorter. But
   now the Government will consider allowing export of coding
   systems with keys up to 64 bits long -- on the condition
   that decoding keys be held in escrow for access by
   authorized law-enforcement officials.
   "This is definitely a compromise," said Ray Kammer, the
   deputy director of the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology. "During the past year we've had a pretty
   spirited debate about the possibility of a 64-bit software
   key-escrow system. Law enforcement people had to get used
   to the notion it might be possible to do this."
   The vulnerability of 40-bit systems was underscored two
   days ago. A French student decoded a message that had been
   encoded using the 40-bit security feature in the European
   version of the Netscape Communications Corporation software
   for navigating the Internet's World Wide Web service.
   The student, Damien Doligez, at Ecole Polytechnique, a
   French engineering and sciences college, used 120 computers
   in a campus network to simultaneously test every key
   possible in a short period. It took him eight days, but he
   was able to decode a single encoded Netscape message. Mr.
   Doligez announced his achievement on the Internet.
   Yesterday, Netscape issued a statement saying that the
   version of its software distributed in the United States
   supports 128-bit keys, which the company said would require
   more than one trillion times the computing power the French
   student used to decode the message.
   Despite the industry's tentative willingness to accept a
   key-escrow coding plan, civil liberties organizations and
   other computer experts said that escrow techniques made
   little sense in light of the fact that private individuals
   might use any kind of coding system they wished to exchange
   information domestically. Encoding systems without escrow
   keys are also widely available overseas.
   "How does key escrow accomplish what the Government has set
   out to do?" asked David Sobel, legal counsel for the
   Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington D.C.
   public interest group. "Nonescrowed encryption is out
   there," he said. "And for the concerns law and enforcement
   and intelligence have, the problem remains and it will
   remain under this policy."

      Companies hoping to start selling stronger encryption

      For instance, one unresolved issue is how to certify

      organized-crime figures out of the business. And the
      administration's emerging policy doesn't deal with
      data-security hardware -- products that wire the
      encryption schemes right into chips or other devices.
      Even with the export restrictions, U.S. officials
      haven't been able to stop widespread international
      distribution of an encryption program, called Pretty
      Good Privacy, that is nearly impossible to crack.

   A feature designed to make electronic mail easy to use on
   the Microsoft Network online service may also make it
   easier for hackers to trick users into running destructive
   software programs on their PCs.
   When a Microsoft Network user sends a binary file embedded
   in an E-mail message, the file appears as an icon on the
   recipient's screen. The recipient can double-click on the
   icon to automatically download the embedded file and
   execute it. To download the file without executing it, the
   recipient must use the mouse's right button, which has been
   rarely needed until now.
   Though other online services offer automatic downloading of
   files, Microsoft's goes one step further in allowing the
   file's automatic execution. That file could be a virus or
   other malicious program that could erase files or reformat
   a hard disk, according to Mike Wyman, VP and chief
   technical offficer of Interactive Data Corp., an investment

   Microsoft says the feature is a convenience, not a security

      that they would design a system to create "electronic
      checks" that could be used to make payments over the
      Internet or other electronic mail systems. Unlike the
      electronic bill-payment services increasingly offered by
      banks, electronic checks could be sent directly by
      customers to their recipients, without going through the
      bank. The electronic check would contain all the
      information that is on today's paper checks. In
      addition, the check would contain a "digital signature,"
      a security code that could prove that the check was
      authorized by the account holder.

   "C.I.A. Still in Dark on Spy's Damage."
      Eighteen months after the arrest of Aldrich H. Ames,
      Moscow's mole inside the Central Intelligence Agency,
      the agency has still not sounded the depths of the
      damage he did. The process of looking backward to
      reconstruct the past and understand the present -- the
      business of "walking back the cat," in espionage argot
      -- has proved immensely frustrating. Often he did not
      know the true names or roles of the people he betrayed.
      The Soviet (and later the Russian) intelligence services
      forced some of the men Mr. Ames betrayed to become pawns
      in a game of deception, using them to feed false
      information on some of those operations to the C.I.A. in
      an effort to mislead and mystify the agency. The C.I.A.
      became a laughing stock for the way in which it
      investigated itself once it knew its Soviet agents had
      been betrayed.

   "Russia's Threat Beneath the Surface."
      Most elements of Russias's military arsenal are
      shrinking in numbers and effectiveness. Yet Russia is
      still completing construction of submarines begun in the
      Soviet era, on about the same timetable as the Soviets
      produced them. Recently, it laid the keel for an even
      more advanced submarine and will enter the next century
      with the largest nuclear submarine fleet in the world.
      That new Russian subs are so quiet is attributable in
      part to the skill of Russian scientists and engineers,
      in part to Western technology illicitly acquired, and in
      part to help from two convicted American spies, John
      Walker and Jerry Whitworth, who for many years sold U.S.
      secrets to the Soviet Union.

   on a proposal for a "Criteria Zero":

Intel Scalable Systems Division
   Fortunately, advances in computer hardware and software    are making computer-based virtual weapons testing and prototyping a
   viable and affordable alternative to the traditional nuclear    non-nuclear testing of stockpile stewardship. The Intel    computer announced today is a key milestone in the shift from nuclear
   testing to computer-simulated testing.
  The ASCI Program
   Located within the DOE's Defense Programs (DP) laboratories, the U.S.
   Department of Energy's Accelerated Strategic Computing    (ASCI) is a multi-year program to extend DOE's computational    to support virtual testing and prototyping capabilities for    weapons. ...
   ASCI has four objectives, each of which requires    capabilities that are beyond the capabilities of existing      * Performance -- Create credible virtual tests to analyze        performance and predict the behavior of nuclear weapons.
     * Safety -- Predict the behavior of full weapons systems in complex
       accident scenarios.
     * Reliability -- Develop the ability to make predictions that will
       extend the lifetime of current weapons, predict failure        and reduce routine maintenance requirements.
     * Renewal -- Use virtual prototyping to reduce production        testing facilities for stockpile requalification and        work. ...
   Beyond its weapons safety impact, the teraflop computer will have a
   wide range of other applications -- from developing safer,    efficient cars to simulating natural disasters in real-time to finding
   new drugs to fight disease. The machine will be one of the    foremost scientific research tools and will act as a magnet    advanced research projects.
   In 1963, John Kennedy referred to a test ban treaty as a shaft of
   light cut into the darkness of the Cold War -- a chance to step back
   from the shadows of war. Today, by making it possible to ensure the
   safety, reliability, and performance of the weapons stockpile while
   foregoing nuclear testing, the Intel/Sandia teraflop computer can help
   the world take a further step back from the shadows of war into the
   light of peace.

Responding to msg by anonymous-remailer () on Sun, 10 Sep  2:8  AM
   Picking up the possible mandated use of key escrow in the
   UK:
   There was chat at the NIST key escrow meeting that low-bit
   key escrow may be the global policy in the works among
   governments. With a blanket outlawing of all non-escrowed
   systems. And, that US key escrow and 64-bit export policy
   is a harbinger of domestic regulation.
   A fed at the B-2 breakout session imperiously barked the
   mantra chanted by several feds at the general meeting, "64-
   bit encryption is what industry asked for, why are you now
   complaining."
   To the counter-question, "what industry are you referring
   to?" the answer was always just "industry."
   The USG's latest key escrow policy, the NIST meetings and
   the Intellectual Cryptography Insitute's conference "Global
   Challenges" posted here may be the surfacing of a well-
   orchestrated government and "industry" collusion on this
   issue. Note the common ever-present attendees of both NIST
   and the ICI meetings.
   Certainly, some "industry" spokespersons like "Daughter of
   Clipper" Denning presume by their tone of writing that key
   escrow is on its way to supremacy, with only quibbling left
   on the criteria for acceptably "competitive" variations.
   The NIST handouts of industry players seem to bear this out
   as well, even as some join the public kibitzing. Perhaps
   their raz, and that of BSA, is just a diverting smokescreen
   to induce complacency -- or squeaking wheels to get USG
   attention for sweetheart contracts.
   Maybe they've already met privately with USG reps to get
   rewarded with a piece of the PGP/non-escrow clamp-down biz
   -- more venerable suckling of national security kabooty as
   advised by smart-varmints like ex-NSA Mr. Stewart
   Abercrombie Baker, Every-meet-attending-Esq.
   I wonder if Mrs. Denning and Mr. Baker are advising their
   sweating crypto clients, "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em,
   the international escrow train is leaving the station,
   better get on before it's too late."
   While fretting of derailment by hackers, or worse, by
   international security agencies paranoid of gov-biz
   complicity to take over the "if you knew what I knew"
   crypto-protected cornucopia.
   Wonder who's really engineering this GAK Limited runaway?
   Does anybody know David Kahn well enough to ask what he's
   finding as NSA Visiting Historian -- in the archives and in
   the job-insecure-spook resumes heat-seeking crypto fires?

The New York Times, September 11, 1995, p. D7.
   Technology / Peter H. Lewis
   On The Net. Privacy for computers? Clinton sets the stage
   for a debate on data encryption.
   In terms of its ability to raise the nation's blood
   pressure, the debate over data encryption has not yet
   reached the same levels as gun control.
   But last week the Clinton Administration appeared to set
   the stage for an equally divisive debate over the degree to
   which businesses and individuals have the right to keep
   secrets when using telephones, computers and other forms of
   electronic communications.
   In two days of public hearings last week in Gaithersburg,
   Md., home of the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology, the Administration introduced its long-awaited
   proposals to relax restrictions on the export of
   cryptographic software.
   The Administration drew a line in the virtual sands of
   cyberspace, signaling that it is willing to permit
   Americans to put stronger cryptographic locks on their
   electronic data only if a spare key to those locks is made
   available on demand to law-enforcement agencies.
   There looms the conflict. Although the debate is about
   export controls the "export" issue is irrelevant in today's
   era of global electronic networks. Placing a common privacy
   program on an Internet computer in Austin, Tex., is
   effectively no different from sending a shrink-wrapped copy
   of the program to Moscow.
   The real issue is how much privacy the Government is
   willing to allow its own citizens, and the latest word from
   the Clinton Administration is that the right to electronic
   privacy, like the right to bear arms, is not absolute.
   Cryptography is the science of secret writing. In this
   digital era, it applies not just to notes, but also to
   telephone calls, money transfers, bank and credit card
   records, electronic mail, faxes and other computer files.
   The Clinton Administration's goal is to allow Americans to
   use the strongest possible cryptographic technology, while
   at the same time preserving the ability of law-enforcement
   agencies to perform court-authorized wiretaps as part of
   the effort to catch drug dealers, terrorists, child
   pornographers and other miscreants.
   In other words, it favors strong cryptography, but not too
   strong.
   The strength of cryptographic software is measured by the
   length of the software key necessary to encode and decode
   a message. The longer the key, the harder it is for an
   unauthorized user to decipher the message.
   In recent years, the Government has generally permitted
   Americans to export cryptographic software with key lengths
   up to 40 bits. Experts say that 40-bit keys are secure from
   casual snooping, but will fall quickly to a determined
   codebreaker.
   Last week, after more than a year of intense analysis, the
   Government introduced what it said was the best possible
   compromise.
   Under the new policy, companies can export encryption
   algorithms using 64-bit keys, which are much more secure,
   but only if spare keys are given to "escrow agents" who
   would make them available to lawenforcement agents under
   standard legal procedures, similar to legal wiretaps
   authorized by a judge. Otherwise, the 40-bit limit
   continues to apply.
   Such a "key escrow" scheme is anathema to many privacy
   advocates who fear Government abuses. The Government first
   proposed a key escrow system with its so-called Clipper
   Chip, a technology that failed to win acceptance even as a
   voluntary standard.
   The new scheme is somewhat more palatable than Clipper. Key
   escrow is still unpopular with American computer and
   software companies, which say it prevents them from
   competing against foreign companies that have no similar
   constraints, and with many multinational corporations,
   which say it prevents them from working with foreign
   companies that do not especially care for the idea of Uncle
   Sam holding the keys to their data banks.
   "If this was intended to be any sort of compromise, I don't
   think it achieved its end," said Whitfield Diffie, a Sun
   Microsystems enginePs who attended the meetings. "I didn't
   see anybody who was enthusiastic."
   Raymond G. Kammer, deputy director of N.l.S.T., suggested
   that the hearings last week were intended to elicit public
   comment, and that the Administration's final position on
   cryptographic policy were still under analysis.
   But the emergence of key escrow issues at the N.l.S.T.
   proceedings suggests that key escrow is emerging as a
   nonnegotiable demand by some factions of the Clinton
   Administration, especially the Justice Department and the
   Federal Bureau of Investigation, led by Louis Freeh.
   "If this fails," said a figure familiar with the
   Administration's thinking on the proposed change in
   cryptographic policy, "it's going to lead to a very
   divisive debate. And the irony, for libertarians who oppose
   key escrow, is that if it fails, I am convinced that Louis
   Freeh cannot be true to his job without proposing domestic
   controls on data encryption."
   "He's not going to give up without a fight, and neither is
   the Justice Department," said the figure, who spoke on the
   condition he not be identified.
   Others say they do not think the Clinton Administration has
   yet arrived at a concrete position, even after more than a
   year of study and debate. "I don't think it's a final
   offer," said John Gilmore, an engineer at Cygnus Support,
   a computer company in Mountain View, Calif. "It looks to me
   like a weak strawman, a first offer, a proposal to dance."
   The question is whether American citizens and businesses
   have the patience to wait for the music to start. And the
   issue may be moot, anyway because the Internet is no more
   controlled by the United States than is the United Nations.
   "The Internet Architecture Board has specifically decided
   to ignore export controls in designing the security
   infrastructure for the next generation of Internet
   protocols," Mr. Gilmore said. "The Internet of 1998 will
   provide automatic, secure, and fully private communication,
   without key escrow, internationally."
   In other words, the Internet community is already planning
   to jump over the new line in the sand drawn last week by
   the Administration. Cryptogrophy that is stronger than the
   Government's proposed system will be built into the
   Internet by a dozen countries, and American companies and
   individuals would be foolish not to use it.
   At that point, millions of Americans will come into direct
   conflict with Government policy, and the popular
   gun-control bumper sticker may be replaced by one that says
   "If cryptography is outlawed, only outlaws will have
   cryptography."

A response to the quote below from your NIST Key Escrow web I got the full Discussion Paper  with all ten criteria from the main desk, along with others that seemed to be appearing as the day passed. (I'll fax a copies of any of the handouts to anyone wanting hardcopy. We scanned all handouts.)
In breakout session B-2, we were also given only that part of Paper  that dealt with our session's criteria 3, 4 and 9. It was passed out at the end of the meeting after discussion had ceased. We did not get a chance to discuss the "example potential solutions."
Strange procedure: it seemed as if NIST was sleight-of-handing prepared backup papers as if they anticipated resistance. Maybe there would have been more concessions or more rabbits pulled from the KE hat if there had been even louder "brrrrat-GAK."
Never too late to ask for those other trapped bunnies.

      We are not concerned with bad people using crypto among

The New York Times, September 19, 1995, pp. A1, D21.
   Security Flaw Is Discovered In Software Used in Shopping
   By John Markoff
   San Francisco, Sept. 18 -- A serious security flaw has been
   discovered in Netscape, the most popular software used for
   computer transactions over the Internet's World Wide Web,
   threatening to cast a chill over the emerging market for
   electronic commerce.
   The flaw, which could enable a knowledgeable criminal to
   use a computer to break Netscape's security coding system
   in less than a minute, means that no one using the software
   can be certain of protecting credit card information, bank
   account numbers or other types of information that Netscape
   is supposed to keep private during on-line transactions.
   The weakness was identified by two first-year graduate
   students in computer science at the University of
   California at Berkeley, who published their findings on an
   Internet mailing list Sunday evening.
   Although the Netscape Communications Corporation, which
   produces the software, said today that the flaw could be
   fixed and that new copies of the software would be
   distributed as early as next week, Internet experts said
   the discovery underscored the danger of assuming that any
   computer security system was safe.
   "There needs to be much more public auditability in the way
   these financial security systems are designed and
   implemented," said Eric Hughes, president of Open Financial
   Networks, a company in Berkeley that is developing Internet
   commerce systems.
   The Netscape software is already used by an estimated eight
   million people for navigating the World Wide Web portion of
   the Internet. On the Web, thousands of companies offer
   text, images, video and audio information, much of it as a
   way of advertising or directly selling goods and services.
   Because the Netscape software is not only easy to use but
   has also been promoted as a secure way of dealing with
   personal and financial information, it has been seen as the
   emerging de facto standard for on-line commerce.
   Already, a diverse group of companies -- including Wells
   Fargo Bank, MCI Communications, Internet Shopping Network
   and Virtual Vineyards -- have adopted Netscape as the
   vehicle for checking bank balances, catalogue shopping or
   buying wine on line.
   Although Internet experts agreed with the company's
   assessment that the flaw could be fixed and that it posed
   no risk to people who use the World Wide Web only to
   retrieve nonsensitive data, the security problem's
   disclosure may represent a public relations setback for
   Netscape Communications and an inconvenience to millions of
   people who may feel a need to replace the version of
   Netscape installed on their computers. Last month the
   company's shares began public trading and had one of the
   most successful first days in Wall Street's history,
   largely on the resounding popularity of the Netscape
   software.
   Today, as word of the security flaw circulated only within
   fairly small circles of Internet users, Netscape's stock
   closed with a slight loss, down 75 cents, to $52.50, in low
   Nasdaq trading volume.
   The company said it would release a repaired version of the
   software within a week. Users will be able to download it
   free over the Internet, through the Netscape site on the
   World Wide Web (
   The company had previously announced a next-generation
   version of Netscape that it said would be more secure than
   the original, and it said today that it would release this
   updated version within the next few weeks. But first it
   will remove the newly disclosed flaw, which is currently in
   the new version.
   "The good news and the bad news of the Internet is that
   when you put something up there, many more people can test
   it," said Mike Homer, the vice president of marketing at
   Netscape. "You also give yourself the opportunity of having
   people point things out which you can fix quickly."
   The company so far has distributed most copies of its
   program free over the Internet, under a strategy of making
   its money from commercial customers who use Netscape to
   provide services or for other business applications over
   the World Wide Web. So replacing the copies will not be an
   expensive undertaking.
   Instead, for Netscape Communications and for other
   companies betting their futures on the Internet, the real
   cost of this disclosure may be in the public's shaken
   confidence in the ability of computer companies to insure
   privacy and security for on-line commerce.
   The weakness in Netscape's security was discovered by Ian
   Goldberg, 22, and David Wagner, 21, two computer science
   students who share an office at the university and who also
   share an interest in the arcane science of cryptography,
   which is becoming increasingly important for business as
   companies begin to explore electronic commerce.
   The two students said they had decided to put the software
   to a test in an effort to raise public concern about
   placing too much trust in unproved electronic security
   systems.
   Netscape's security is based on a type of coding technology
   known generically as public key cryptography in which users
   exchange mathematically generated numbers -- or keys -- to
   encode or decode information. In such systems, a new key is
   created for each information exchange, based on a
   mathematical formula that is combined with numbers
   supposedly known only to the sender or recipient.
   The students found that by determining how Netscape's
   formula generated the number used as a starting point for
   creating a key, they were able to greatly reduce the
   potential combinations that would unlock the code. The
   starting-point number turned out to be based on the time
   and date of the transaction, combined with several other
   unique bits of information taken from a user's computer
   system -- bits of information that an electronic intruder
   could determine, if he were intent on intercepting a
   Netscape user's transactions.
   Knowing how the starting-point number was created greatly
   reduced the other possible components of the formula -- and
   the students found they were able to break the code in a
   matter of seconds using a standard computer work station.
   Netscape officials said today that they would strengthen
   the system, by making it significantly harder to determine
   the random number at the heart of their coding system. They
   said they would no longer disclose what data would be used
   to generate the random numbers.
   The announcement of the flaw was posted Sunday night on a
   computer network mailing list maintained by an informal
   group known as Cypherpunks. The group, which is made up of
   mathematicians, computer experts and privacy advocates, has
   been campaigning for more effective electronic security
   systems.
   The discovery is the second reported security weakness in
   the Netscape program to be posted on the Cypherpunks list
   in the last month. In August, Damien Doligez, a student at
   the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, used a network of 120
   computers, running for eight days, to generate a Netscape
   secret key. But his was a "brute force" attack, requiring
   the computers to sample a vast range of numbers before
   coming up with a key that would break the code.
   The Berkeley students, in contrast, by identifying a basic
   flaw in the way Netscape set up its security system, were
   able to narrowly focus their attack to quickly break the
   code, with far less computer power.

   The F.B.I. Sting Operation on Child Pornography Raises
   Questions About Cryptography
   By Peter H. Lewis
   Federal agents swooped down on more than 125 homes and
   offices across the United States on Sept. 13, seizing
   computers and diskettes from people suspected of
   trafficking in child pornography over the America Online
   network. But to date, the number of arrests in the sting
   operation remains at 15.
   More arrests are expected, but why haven't more occurred?
   Last week, Louis J. Freeh, the director of the F.B.I.,
   offered an oblique explanation for the seemingly low
   initial success rate.
   At least some of the suspected child pornographers had used
   data encryption software, Mr. Freeh said Thursday in
   remarks at an International Cryptography Institute
   conference in Washington. In other words, they had
   scrambled their computer files so that only someone with
   the password -- or with proper code-breaking skills --
   could view the contents.
   Mr. Freeh wisely did not say whether the F.B.I. agents were
   able to decipher the encrypted files seized in the
   investigation. It would be foolhardy, from a
   law-enforcement perspective, to tip one's hand.
   If the head of the F.B.I. acknowledged that his agency was
   powerless to crack a cryptography program like Pretty Good
   Privacy, the stampede for that software on the Internet
   would make the run on Windows 95 look puny.
   From a political perspective, Mr. Freeh's coyness is shrewd
   as well. By making even a subtle suggestion that some child
   pornographers may walk free because of unbreakable
   cryptography, he gains more leverage in seeking
   Government-mandated controls over the use of encryption
   technology.
   Mr. Freeh said that encryption was a "public safety" issue,
   and he said law-enforcement agencies around the world "will
   not tolerate" the use of private data encryption to impede
   investigations. He said encryption had also been
   encountered in the Philippines in a plot to blow up an
   American jet and to assassinate Pope John Paul lI (in that
   case, at least, one can presume the code was cracked.)
   It seems worthwhile to point out that even if the suspects
   in the child pornography sting, called Operation Innocent
   Images, used cryptography, that did not provide evidence
   that they were doing something illegal. Our legal system is
   predicated on the belief that one is innocent unless proved
   guilty, and there is no exception clause for technology.
   "Fortunately we are not yet at the point where the mere use
   of encryption overcomes the presumption of innocence," said
   David Sobel, staff counsel for the Electronic Privacy
   Information Center in Washington.
   Another point to remember is that the F.B.I. identified
   more than 100 suspects, and gathered sufficient information
   to warrant raids, using existing laws and enforcement
   techniques. On the other hand, there is no denying that
   child pornographers use data encryption to keep co-workers,
   family members and police from discovering their secrets.
   "We are involved in a couple of jobs every week resolving
   some kind of a child pornography investigation," said Eric
   K. Thompson, president of Access Data Inc. of Orem, Utah,
   a private company that specializes in cracking encrypted
   files for corporations and Government agencies.
   The Government's elite codebreakers at the National
   Security Administration are prohibited by law from using
   their talents against American citizens. The F.B.I. has its
   own code-breaking experts, but it routinely calls on
   independent experts like Access Data to help on some cases.
   After eight years of breaking into encrypted files, ranging
   from situations involving secretaries who simply forgot
   their passwords for important memos to cases involving
   corporate computer systems that were encrypted by
   disgruntled employees, Mr. Thompson has concluded:
   "Basically, the criminal element is becoming more computer
   literate, and they are discovering encryption. Files are
   becoming more difficult to break."
   Dorothy Denning, an expert in cryptography and a professor
   of computer science at Georgetown University in Washington,
   said she recognized the importance of encryption for
   businesses seeking to protect information. At the same
   time, she said, she also recognized the problems that
   law-enforcement agencies face because of cryptography.
   "So many people had been saying people in law enforcement
   weren't having this problem, and I didn't believe that,"
   Dr. Denning said. So in May, she said, she spent two days
   calling sources at law-enforcement organizations. "I came
   up with over 20 cases -- child pornography, terrorism,
   murder, embezzlement fraud, tax protesters, export
   violations -- and, in some cases, they were able to crack
   it, and others they couldn't," she said.
   What can be done? The Administration's plan is to seek
   voluntary compliance with a "key escrow" plan, which would
   enable citizens to use strong, private cryptography as long
   as a copy of the software "key" were made available to law
   enforcement officials.
   Last week, Mr. Freeh stressed that he preferred a voluntary
   approach. But "if consensus is impossible" on the
   encryption issue, he said, the F.B.I. might consider other
   approaches.
   The debate is certain to heat up as more information about
   Operation Innocent Images becomes known. There are no
   comforting answers, only an echo of advice from a time
   predating the Internet: There is no solution. Seek it
   wisely.

   Netscape Software for Cruising Internet Is Found to Have
   Another Security Flaw
   By Jared Sandberg
   Another security flaw that has long plagued the Internet
   has been found in software by Netscape Communications Corp.
   and others, raising concerns for the privacy and safety of
   information on the global computer network.
   The flaw in Netscape's popular Navigator software, which
   helps users cruise the multimedia portion of the Internet
   known as the World Wide Web, is the third defect in the
   software discovered by the "Cypherpunks" discussion group
   in little over a month. Members of the Cypherpunk group,
   which includes mathematicians and hackers who discuss the
   security method of cryptography, last month broke
   Netscape's "key" that protects sensitive data by "brute
   force" -- the use of massive computing power. Last week,
   other members found a flaw that could let hackers
   essentially pick the lock in Netscape's software.
   Unlike the prior glitches, however, the latest flaw doesn't
   lend itself to the theft of multiple credit-card numbers.
   Instead, it could allow a savvy hacker to damage an
   Internet user's computer, such as crashing the computer or
   deleting files.
   "This is just another indication that Netscape isn't being
   careful," said William Cheswick, a security researcher at
   AT&T Corp.'s Bell Laboratories.
   Still, he said, the flaw goes well beyond Netscape. It
   first reared its head seven years ago when Cornell graduate
   student Robert Morris used it to create a "worm" that
   crippled thousands of computers on the Internet. Last
   February, the same kind of flaw was found in the popular
   Mosaic program created by the University of Illinois. But
   that strain of the flaw was more serious than its latest
   appearance because it affected the computers that store
   many users' credit-card numbers. Now experts are
   discovering that the flaw shows up in other so-called Web
   browsers such as Links and Arena.
   "We're so glad that the network dog dances, we don't
   realize that it's rabid," Mr. Cheswick said of the
   programming quality of many software packages.
   Marc Andreessen, vice president of technology at Netscape,
   said the company will issue fixes for the recent glitches
   later this week. He added that it's unclear whether
   anything other than temporarily crashing a user's computer
   could result trom the recent flaw. But, he said, once users
   adopt the modified software, "this won't be around long
   enough to cause a problem."
   Some, however, worry that another variation of the flaw
   will prove more difficult to cope with in the coming
   months. Bruce Fancher, president of Phantom Access
   Technologies Inc., operator of the Mindvox Internet access
   service, said a variation of the security hole has been
   found in several Unix software packages, which run on
   thousands of Internet computers that contain user's
   credit-card numbers and other personal information. It
   could cause far more damage than the Netscape flaw, he
   said. "This is going to be a big problem," warned Mr.
   Fancher, adding that he's been told that hackers are
   already devising software toolkits to exploit the hole.
   "This flaw is an easy mistake to make, but it's also easy
   to fix," he said.
   The latest flaw came to light early Friday morning when a
   reader of the Cypherpunk mailing list discovered the glitch
   and posted a message to the Internet. Basically, the
   software on an end-user's machine allows for commands that
   are too long, letting an intruder tack on an extra line of
   damaging code that could crash the computer. Instead, the
   software should verify the length of the commands that
   computers accept.
   Security buffs concede that the recent round of security
   glitches found in several pieces of software, including a
   virus found in Microsoft Corp.'s Word program and security
   problems at Amefica Online Inc., has shaken confidence in
   electronic commerce. But they say the publicity brings to
   light problems that will ultimately make software more
   secure. Richard Lethin, a graduate student at
   Massachusettes Institute of Technology who participates in
   the Cypherpunk discussion, said: "This technology for
   electronic commerce is ultimately going to be real
   important, but there might be some hiccups at the start."

   Hackers Alert Netscape to Another Flaw
   By Bloomberg Business News
   Mountain View, Calif., Sept. 25 -- The Netscape
   Communications Corporation said today that a third flaw had
   been discovered in its Internet access software by a group
   of computer hackers who call themselves the Cypherpunks.
   The hackers -- computer users and mathematicians who try to
   discover weaknesses in computer software and networks --
   found a design flaw that can shut down Netscape's Navigator
   browser software, which helps people travel on the
   Internet.
   Two American college students last week broke Netscape's
   software security code, a design flaw that could jeopardize
   financial transactions done using Navigator. A month
   earlier, a French hacker broke a different Netscape
   security code.
   "We are learning a lot from these problems," said Michael
   J. Homer, vice president of marketing at Netscape. Shares
   of the company, which sold its first stock to the public
   last month, rose $4.25 today to close at $67 in Nasdaq
   trading.
   The latest flaw found by the hacker group is a programming
   error in Netscape software used to navigate the World Wide
   Web, a part of the Internet made up of photos, sounds and
   drawings.

Worth Magazine, October, 1995, has a longish, easy-reading,
   supportive article on David Chaum and digital cash.
      Virtually alone among E-money thinkers, Chaum insists on
      creating anonymity for all transactions -- building a
      tamper-proof system that works just as "real" cash
      always has, from cowne shells to $100 bills. The key, he
      says, is this: Without the spender's say-so, no one
      should be able to trace who paid whom for what, whether
      a transaction takes place online or in a swipe of a card
      at a coffee shop. It's a libertarian approach in tune
      with Chaum's roots in freewheeling communities such as
      Berkeley and Amsterdam -- but it is anathema to control
      freaks like the FBI, the IRS, and corporate information
      marketers.
      Chaum says every digital-cash system but his has the
      potential to be abused or compromised -- and the math
      seems to bear him out. His competitors, however, insist
      their plans will prove plenty secure in practice. They
      dismiss Chaum as an incorrigible purist, a brilliant
      mathematician and innovator whose political views are
      hindering his chances of success.
      Like many in the digital elite, Chaum, an unabashed

      electronic money is just the first consumer use of an
      arcane field he hopes will transform society:
      cryptology, the science of secret codes. In cyberspace,
      these codes can prove a powerful way of shielding a
      person's identity -- or of verifying an identity without
      giving away extra information. Armed with personal
      computers and good software, says Chaum, ordinary people
      will finally have the power to do and say things without
      being tracked by Big Brother.

   Hewlett Lobbies for Its Encryption Plan That Would
   Satisfy Tough Export Rules
   By Don Clark
   Hewlett-Packard Co. is pushing an unusual plan to
   protect electronic transactions around the world
   without running afoul of U.S. export laws.
   The Palo Alto, Calif., computer maker said it has been
   lobbying government agencies for more than a year to
   gain support for its proposal, which uses a
   data-scrambling technology to protect transactions
   from tampering or theft of data. Strong encryption
   technologies ordinarily fall under tough export rules
   that limit technologies which could impede U.S.
   wire-tapping capabilities, a source of continuing
   friction between the government and high-technology
   companies.
   H-P, in a plan developed with the French company
   Gemplus SCA, wants to split the code-making
   technologies into two pieces that would be approved
   under different government standards. One device,
   which could fit in a standard computer, would contain
   a basic encryption capability that is designed to be
   broadly exported without the need to seek a separate
   export license for each foreign user.
   Would Help Industry
   That device, dubbed an encryption engine, would be
   useless without the addition of another tiny piece of
   hardware that contains a code-making formula set at a
   specific strength. The second device, called a policy
   card, would be separately reviewed by the U.S. State
   Department for each customer.
   Government agencies, including codebreakers at the
   National Security Agency, would still have a say over
   the strength of encryption exports. But customers
   could build commercial applications around the
   proposed encryption engine, knowing that it will work
   with any code-making formula that governments might
   adopt in the future. Now they run the risk that their
   work will become obsolete amid policy changes in
   Washington, D.C., and other countries.
   State Department officials weren't immediately
   available for comment. Stewart Baker, a former NSA
   general counsel who now practices law in Washington,
   D.C., termed the H-P plan a clever answer to the
   problem of shifting government policy.
   "There was a lot of skepticism when H-P first proposed
   it," said Lynn McNulty, a former encryption specialist
   at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
   "But it looks to me that they are well on the way to
   the next step."
   H-P Confident of Approval
   Doug McGowan, an H-P manager involved with the
   project, said he expects to receive U.S. approval by
   next year to begin shipping the encryption engine
   freely to Western Europe and Canada. "We believe we
   will receive relaxed export controls," he said.
   H-P's plan fits some of the NSA's objectives. For one
   thing, its technology embeds encryption technology in
   microchips that can't easily be modified by computer
   hackers or terrorists. H-P's policy cards also could
   be adapted for a controversial Clinton administration
   proposal called key escrow, in which mathematical keys
   to break codes could be stored for later use by law
   enforcement or intelligence agencies, Mr. McGowan
   said.
   The plan complements a parallel H-P effort to develop
   a new generation of "smart" data cards to let
   consumers buy goods and services around the world
   electronically. Gemplus, a huge supplier of credit and
   debit cards in Europe, is supplying technology to that
   effort along with Informix Corp., a database software
   maker in Menlo Park, Calif.
   Jeff Hudson, an Informix vice president, said the
   partners' proposed cards could store money and a
   database worth of personal information, such as
   medical records. That approach could eliminate the
   need to connect to multiple companies or agencies to
   manage such information, since it would be stored on
   each card, the companies said.

   Microsoft and Visa Expected to Unveil Internet Technology
   By a WSJ Staff Reporter

   The software company and bank clearinghouse have been

   Other key players in the Internet-security race include

   Cracks in the code
   Peter Martin calls for an easing of US restrictions on
   the export of encryption technology
   Encryption used to be a subject of interest only to spies
   and mathematicians. But the central role that the
   electronic transmission of information is playing in
   commerce and society make it now a technology of enormous
   practical relevance. Two recent stories out of many
   exemplify this trend.
   Citibank lost $400,000, it is alleged, to a Russian hacker
   who managed to crack its clients' passwords. The solution
   to this security problem: a new generation of encrypted
   passwords that are much harder to crack.
   And Netscape Navigator, the leading "browser" program for
   the Internet's fast-growing World Wide Web, has been shown
   to have flaws in its encryption routine. In theory at
   least, these make it possible for outsiders to read
   encrypted data sent over the net -- such as credit card
   numbers. Netscape acknowledges the problems and says it
   will have fixes available by today.
   Is this crucial technology vulnerable to determined attack
   by hackers and fraudsters?
   Before considering the question, remember that the
   introduction of any new technology highlights risks
   uncomplainingly borne for years. The safety precautions
   demanded of the Channel tunnel are one example, as compared
   with those required of traditional trains or ferries.
   Similarly, it is argued, people have been unhesitatingly
   using analogue mobile phones, reading credit card details
   over the telephone, and sending off faxes into the ether
   without any of the panic that now surrounds the issue of
   Internet security.
   The comparison is an instructive one, but not entirely
   fair. What worries Internet users is not so much that a
   determined enemy might target them for eavesdropping, or
   even that chance might put their credit card details in the
   hands of a dishonest person.
   Instead, they worry about the Internet's unstructured
   nature under which messages are passed from computer to
   computer across the world until they reach their final
   destination.
   In principle, this would allow a criminal to leave a
   "sniffer" program lurking, electronically, at one of the
   nodes, recognising credit card numbers as they passed by,
   and scooping them up for subsequent exploitation. People
   also fear an attack on the computers of merchants selling
   goods over the Internet -- each containing thousands of
   credit card numbers. The fear is thus not one of random
   theft but of systematic brigandage.
   Encryption is all that stops such fears paralysing
   electronic commerce before it has properly begun. It is
   therefore in the general public interest that effective
   encryption be widely available.
   The Netscape problem illustrates how easy it is for the
   inherent mathematical strengths of a modern encryption
   scheme to be overcome by an oversight in its supporting
   plumbing. One of the faults in Netscape's encryption, for
   example, stems from too predictable a method of generating
   the random numbers needed to make the scheme work.
   It also illustrates how, once a code-breaker's task is
   simplified by such a weakness, today's powerful networks of
   cheap computers make it quick to crack even the most
   sophisticated encryption schemes. The narrower the range of
   numbers through which the cracker's computers must sift in
   order to find a meaningful answer, the greater the
   probability of breaking the code within a useful amount of
   time.
   All the more reason, then, for non-Americans to view with
   dismay a US policy which restricts the international
   distribution of the most powerful forms of encryption. For
   national security reasons, the US insists that the version
   of Netscape sold outside North America must contain a
   weaker form of encryption than that available to Americans
   and Canadians.
   The international version is restricted to a 40-digit
   "key", while the North American version uses 128 digits.
   The longer the key, the greater the time and computing
   power required for the code to be cracked. In principle,
   given enough computing power, even a message encoded by a
   very long key could be cracked in time. In practice,
   however, the task of cracking many millions of messages to
   find one that is of interest makes messages secure as long
   as the key has enough digits.
   Amateur code-crackers claim to have broken the 40-digit
   version of the Netscape encryption scheme. Their claim is
   hard to verify. But there is no doubt of the weakness in
   the random-number generation procedure; Netscape has
   verified it.
   This fault is common to both North American and export
   versions of the program, so it does not result from the US
   government restrictions on key length. The occasion reminds
   us, however, that effective encryption is essential to the
   growth of electronic commerce. And it teaches us that
   simplifying the code-breaker's task -- by error in
   Netscape's case, by deliberate diktat in the case of the
   government restriction is an easy way to make transmissions
   vulnerable.
   There was never much justification for the US determination
   to weaken exported encryption products. There is less now.

   Russians Arrest 6 In Computer Thefts
   St. Petersburg, Russia, Sept 26 (AP) -- Russian police
   officers have arrested six more people in a $10 million
   computer theft from Citibank here, but the masterminds are
   said to remain at large.
   An officer in the organized crime division was quoted by
   the Itar-Tass news agency as saying that six people had
   been arrested in St. Petersburg on swindling charges
   stemming from the case involving Citibank, the chief unit
   of Citicorp. Weapons and tax-evaslon charges may also be
   filed.
   The police confiscated two computers and a number of
   computer diskettes, plus weapons and cash from the
   suspects.
   Bank and law-enforcement officials say a gang of thieves in
   St. Petersburg broke into Citlbank's electronic
   cash-management system scores ot times and transferred
   money into their own accounts.
   Several people have been arrested abroad and face charges
   in the United States, including Vladimir Levin, 28,

   Citibank officials said they recovered all but $400,000 and
   upgraded the cash-management systems's electronic security

   Extradition in Citibank hacking case
   A British court yesterday approved the extradition to the
   US of Mr Vladimir Levin, the Russian science graduate
   accused of an attempted $10m (6.5m pounds) computer hacking
   fraud on Citibank. ...
   Mr Levin has been charged in the UK with offences under the
   Computer Misuse Act, forgery and false accounting. The US
   authorities are now drawing up similar charges to bring
   against him.
   Mr Levin is one of six people arrested over the alleged
   attempted fraud on Citibank. An FBI inquiry into the
   incident is continuing and it is believed that others are
   still being sought.
   When Mr Levin is returned to the US, he is likely to be
   closely questioned by the authorities, who are anxious to
   discover more of the technical details of the alleged
   attempted fraud.
   Mr Levin, who was arrested earlier this year travelling
   through Stansted airport in the UK, would appeal against
   the court's decision, his lawyers said. He has 14 days to
   lodge an appeal to the High Court in London. ...

Financial Times, September 28, 1995, p.1.
   Rivalry for Internet Security Grows
   By Louise Kehoe in San Francisco
   The Internet rivalry between Microsoft, the world's largest
   software company, and Netscape Communications increased
   yesterday when they announced competing encryption
   technology intended to ensure the security of financial
   transactions over the global computer network.
   Mr James Clark chairman of Netscape, the leading supplier
   of browser software that enables personal computer users to
   "surf" the Internet, also revealed the company had turned
   down a move by Microsoft to take a minority stake in
   Netscape earlier this year, before Netscape's public
   offering.
   Microsoft's encryption technology, developed with Visa
   International the credit card processing organisation, is
   intended to solve Internet security problems which have
   become a serious barrier to electronic commerce.
   Recent incidents, including the hacking of supposedly
   secure Internet software developed by Netscape, have
   heightened concerns about sending sensitive data such as
   credit card numbers over the Internet.
   Microsoft said its Secure Transaction Technology (STT), was
   designed to provide a much higher level of security for
   credit card transactions on the Internet. Netscape's
   general purpose encryption system uses a 40 or 128-bit
   electronic "key", while STT will use 2,000-bit keys.
   "By Christmas of 1996 you will be able to shop on the
   Internet to your heart's content, without even thinking
   about security," said Mr Warren Dent, Microsoft director of
   business development for consumer systems.
   Although no encryption system was totally secure, Mr Dent
   estimated it would take "25 Cray supercomputers a year" to
   break the STT codes.
   Netscape, however, said a new version of its Navigator
   software, which will become available next week will
   provide the same level of security. Netscape's "Secure
   Courier" technology has been developed in conjunction with
   MasterCard, Visa's credit card rival.
   To encourage widespread adoption of STT, Microsoft and Visa
   are making its technical specifications available at no
   charge to third parties to allow them to develop software.
   Netscape said Microsoft is expecting to charge transaction
   fees each time the STT technology is used.
   Commercial software products incorporating STT are expected
   to be available by April, Microsoft said. Netscape says
   Secure Courier will be available sooner.

      "The fact of the matter is that the intelligence
      agencies are the center where all this is put together
      -- the economic, the political and the security
      concerns," said Robert B. Zoellick, a former top State

      makes sense, because they should have more detachment
      than the individual economic agencies would."
   "Economic Espionage." Editorial
      The C.I.A. has not made a convincing case why it should
      start from almost no base to build a center for economic
      intelligence and analysis when the Government can hire
      outside experts or look to agencies like the Treasury
      Department that already have more knowledgeable staffs.
      William Casey had many faults as Director of Central
      Intelligence in the Reagan Administration. But he did
      know a thing or two about economics. Whenever he wanted
      economic intelligence, Mr. Casey often said, he would

      commercial activities "to provide cover security to
      intelligence collection activities undertaken abroad."
      The authority "to provide bona fide commercial cover,"

   U.S. Export Rules to Ease On Some Supercomputers
   Washington -- President Clinton is expected to announce
   today that he is easing export restrictions on certain U.S.
   supercomputers, a move sought by the computer industry.
   Administration officials say that given continuing

   high-speed computers, the current restrictions are
   unrealistic and damaging to American companies. Critics
   contend, however, that easing the restrictions will
   exacerbate weapons proliferation.
   Mr. Clinton approved raising the speed of computers that
   may be exported to most countries to 2,000 million
   theoretical operations a second, or MTOPS, from 1,500
   MTOPS, according to officials. For certain nations,
   including China, Egypt, Israel, India, Pakistan, Syria and
   Russia, civilian customers would be able to buy computers
   with speeds up to 7,000 MTOPS without prior government
   approval. Military customers in those countries could
   purchase computers with speeds of 2,000 to 7,000 MTOPS but
   only with an individual export license.
   Certain nations, such as Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Libya,
   would still be banned from buying high-speed computers.

   When it's all in the mind
   At the department of medical informatics at Graz
   University of Technology in Austria, Gert Pfurtscheller is
   working on a project that could result in
   thought-controlled devices.
   Stephen Roberts, a researcher at the electrical and
   electronics engineering department at Imperial College
   London, has worked with Pfurtscheller's team. He hopes to
   improve the signal classification accuracy by using
   artificial neural networks, computer-based systems designed
   to mimic the way the human brain works.
   Roberts's work is part of an EU research programme called
   Anndee (Artificial Neural Networks for Diagnosis and
   Enhancement of EEG) which involves around 30 researchers in
   a dozen European universities.
   The Consciousness Research laboratory at the University of
   Nevada is pursing a more controversial line of research
   into psychic phenomena or, as its director, Dean Radin,
   prefers to call it, Direct Man/Machine Interaction (DMMI).
   A number of Japanese companies including NEC and
   Matsushita, have also conducted research into DMMI. Radin
   believes that in 20 to 50 years' time, it will be possible

   "Foreign Policy 3.1. Microsoft as World Power." [Foreign
   affairs column]
      Does Microsoft have a foreign policy? Mr. Ballmer says
      Microsoft doesn't have a foreign policy per se. But it
      does have a global business agenda. Since Microsoft
      today has twice the market value of General Motors, it's
      worth looking at that agenda because it is bound to
      influence U.S. foreign policy. Microsoft doesn't need
      Washington to open doors for it because foreign
      governments are begging Microsoft to come in and
      translate Windows 95 into their languages, so they can
      get on the information highway. Describing his contacts
      with foreign leaders, Mr. Ballmer put it this way:
      "People say, 'You have this technology. We hear it's
      changing the world. Tell us how it can help us.' "

      however, one aspect of this change is especially
      important: its effect on "economic sovereignty". They
      claim that global integration is emasculating the modern
      state. If the number of believers is any guide, these
      views are appealing. Yet the new orthodoxy is wrong. The
      world has changed, the global economy has indeed
      arrived: nonetheless, the emasculated state is a myth.

   [Page One]
   Discovery of lnternet Flaws Is Setback for On-Line Trade
   By John Markoff
   San Francisco, Oct. 10 -- Newly publicized weaknesses in
   the basic structure of the Internet indicate that the
   worldwide computer network may need a time-consuming
   redesign before it can be safely used as a commercial
   medium.
   The flaws could allow an eavesdropper or criminal to divert
   many types of documents or software programs traveling over
   the Internet, examine or copy or alter them, and then pass
   them on to the intended recipient -- who would have no easy
   way of knowing that the files had been waylaid. Not only
   could electronic mail be read in transit or credit card
   numbers be copied en route, but special security techniques
   meant to protect such transactions could be dismantled
   without the user's knowledge.
   That such security flaws exist is not surprising in a
   system designed originally as a scientific experiment. But
   the recent rush to the Internet by companies seeking to
   exploit its commercial possibilities has obscured the fact
   that giving the system a new purpose has unearthed
   fundamental problems that could well put off true
   commercial viability for years.
   "Companies would have you believe this is a trivial
   problem," said Eric Brewer, a professor of computer science
   at the University of California at Berkeley. "But now there
   is a financiat incentive to exploit these flaws and to do
   it secretly."
   The problems were described in a posting that researchers
   at the university made on Monday to several on-line
   discussion groups. While the discussion groups are intended
   for computer security experts, they are potentially
   accessible to millions of Internet users -- including
   break-in artists, who are known to monitor such discussion
   groups for tips on new ways to crack computer systems.
   The researchers who described the Internet weaknesses
   include two Berkeley computer science graduate students who
   noted a security weakness in a popular Netscape
   Communications Corporation software program last month.
   Then as now, the students' stated motivation in publicizing
   the problems was to underscore vulnerabilities facing all
   companies and customers wishing to use the Internet for
   commerce.
   When the Netscape problems were disclosed last month, the
   company said the security flaws would be corrected in the
   next version of its software, which users would be able to
   download at no charge from Netscape's Internet site. But
   the newly publicized flaws in the Internet itself indicate
   that even if a user downloaded a copy of the new, improved
   Netscape program, a criminal could tamper with the copy
   along the way and make it unsafe for use in credit card
   transactions.
   The problem is not Netscape's alone; it potentially affects
   any organization that operates a computer from which files
   or software could be downloaded over the Internet. The
   weakness can be traced to the technical underpinnings of
   the network, which was set up more than a quarter-century
   ago not as a medium for conducting business but as a way
   for academic and scientific researchers to exchange
   information.
   The disclosure of the flaws casts doubt on the aspirations
   of companies like Netscape, which last summer had one of
   the most successful stock offerings in Wall Street history
   based on the promise of the impending arrival of a
   full-fledged on-line marketplace.
   "Companies should take a step back and think about this a
   little more," said Ian Goldberg, one of the Berkeley
   students. "If it takes a bit longer but comes out more
   secure, we will all be better off in the long run."
   The way many Internet systems are set up -- especially the
   Internet's increasingly popular World Wide Web service in
   which software images and even video and audio clips can be
   easily downloaded -- information is stored on a computer
   called a file server and then transferred to a user's
   computer when it is needed.
   The newly publicized weakness occurs in a widely used
   Internet protocol -- or technical standard -- known as the
   Network File System, or NFS. Because NFS does not have any
   means for allowing the recipient of a program or document
   to verify that it has not been altered during transmission
   from the file server to the user, any interception or
   tampering would go undetected.
   "The Internet protocols have been insecure since day one,"
   said Jeffrey I. Schiller, the manager of computer networks
   at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director
   of an industry task force that is trying to design a new
   secure version of the Internet.
   But the group's timetable is uncertain, and even when it
   does have recommendations ready, Mr. Schiller is not
   optimistic that the industry will be willing to devote the
   time and money to put them into effect.
   He said that many technologies already exist for improving
   commercial security on the Internet, but many of them
   require too much technical sophistication on the part of
   computer users. He criticized makers of hardware and
   software for not moving more quickly to make easy-to-use
   security features a built-in part of the technology used on
   the Internet.
   "The people who should be the leaders in offering security
   have been too busy counting their money to build these
   features in to their products," Mr. Schiller said.
   Some commercial Internet merchants have tended to play down
   the potential for harm from an illegal interception of
   credit card information over the Internet. They point out
   that consumers routinely make their credit card numbers
   available in transactions done by mail or telephone and
   that the law puts limits on a consumer's liability in cases
   of credit card fraud.
   But Mr. Brewer, the Berkeley professor, said that the
   crucial difference in the proposed Internet commerce
   systems was that for the first time it would be relatively
   simple for a criminal to collect hundreds or thousands of
   credit card numbers. Then a thief could use each credit
   card only one time, making detection much more difficult.
   Sensitive to heightened concerns about security, Wells
   Fargo, the large California bank, which earlier this year
   began permitting customers with personal computers to view
   their account information with the Netscape software,
   suspended the service in September after the Berkeley
   students reported the flaw in Netscape.
   After Netscape followed with an improved version of its
   software, Wells Fargo officials found it secure enough that
   they planned to resume the service later this week. The
   bank will, however, require customers to use the corrected
   version of the Netscape program.
   Even then. Wells Fargo customers will be able only to view
   account balances and other information, but not transfer
   money or conduct other transactions of the type that might
   leave them vulnerable to the Internet NFS weakness.
   "We still hope to be able to offer transactional
   capabilities next year, but this has slowed us down a
   little bit," said Lorna Doubet, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman.
   "Many of our customers feel that security is absolutely
   essential and we have to be cautious in this regard."
   Executives at Netscape said yesterday that they were aware
   of the security issues surrounding NFS and would make
   changes in the next release of their software expected
   before the end of the year to permit a recipient of a
   downloaded program to check it for signs of tampering.
   And hoping to take advantage of the fault-finding talents
   of the Berkeley researchers and other like-minded software
   experts, the company announced a contest today called
   Netscape Bugs Bounty, in which Netscape will award prizes
   to users who find bugs or security loopholes in its
   software.
   Some Internet experts said they expected that many security
   weaknesses like the one the Berkeley group had demonstrated
   would be found, because the Internet was simply not
   designed to insure secure commerce.
   "Imagine a walled town or a house," said Noel Chiappa, a
   member of the Internet Engineering Task Force, a
   standards-setting group. "It doesn't matter if 99 windows
   are tight as can be -- if the 100th is wide open, the bad
   guys will bypass your security. "

@_subject: Enigma 
The NYT reports today on a British best-selling novel about
   breaking the Enigma codes, published this month in the US:
      Enigma, by Robert Harris, Random House.
      Harris interviewed many of the people who worked at
      Bletchley Park, and, most challenging, had to wrestle
      with complex mathematics to explain how the codes were
      broken ... by an elite comprised of an eccentric band of
      British and refugee intellectuals, aided by young women
      carefully picked from upper-class British families.
      So, Mr. Harris was asked, is the book a celebration of
      British amateurism? "There's a bit of that," he
      conceded. "Just as the British benefited from that
      tradition, the Germans were undone by the ruthless
      military efficiency, which made it easier to read their
      messages. The idea of brains taking on brute strength
      does have a certain romantic appeal."
      More than one reviewer said Harris was a thriller writer
      in the British tradition of Eric Ambler, Len Deighton,
      John Le Carre and John Buchan. "Harris has fashioned a
      story that is as humane, intelligent and gripping as
      documentary fiction can get, the critic Anthony Quinn
      wrote in The Financial Times. This is a story of
      intelligence, romance, twisted logic and necessary
      compromise," Peter Millar wrote in The Times of London,
      adding that it was "altogether top-class stuff."

The Financial times today has four-page insert on the
   complexity and difficulty of developing international
   standards for all types of products. There is a passing
   mention of the Internet security issue. An article on
   standards for IT confirms Perry's oft-made points about the
   slow pace, protracted angling for market share, and the by-
   pass of standards by market go-getters who foster messes.
   Here are quotes on the last point:
      Paul Callahan of Forrester Research: "When a company
      owns a market they can determine the pace -- a company
      in its early stages of domination can move the ball
      forward swiftly -- such as the Internet Web software
      provider Netscape. Netscape didn't spend a lot of time
      with standards bodies -- it simply joined forces with
      MasterCard to co-develop Secure Courier, much as
      Microsoft enrolled Visa to develop its STT, Secure
      Transaction Technology. Only afterwards are the
      overtures made to standards bodies. That's commerce, and
      it's the way things are in the real world."
      Henry Ryan, convenor of the Iso-IEC JTC1 ad hoc working
      group on GII: "People ask, 'Can you afford to wait for
      standards?' I'd turn it round. If you don't, you suffer
      in the long term and end up with an unholy mess. If
      people do their own thing then the benefits -- and the
      problems -- may not be concentrated in one sector of the
      industry. We're finding that with the convergence of
      technologies, such as the superhighway, it isn't enough
      to develop standards for the IT sector,       or consumer electronics individually."

   "Will your next computer be a tin can and a wire?"
      This week's fall in technology stocks was bad enough.
      But what if the Internet destroyed the personal-computer
      industry ...?
      Sun, Oracle and Netscape are spending tens of millions
      of dollars on a bet that the Internet can do a lot more
      than pass around e-mail and transmit data. They think it
      can also do much of the work of today's computers,
      holding not just information but software, from word
      processors and spreadsheets to games and entertainment
      programs. Most radically, they go on to argue that this
      could end the reign of the personal computer. Forget
      Windows 95; some people are starting to wonder if they
      need Microsoft at all.
      But those who predict that such machines will kill the
      PC are ignoring computing history, and glitch-prone real
      life. The PC beat the mainframe because users wanted the
      whole computer on their desktop, not in the basement.
      That makes Java terminals look like a step backwards: by
      putting program storage far away down a shared network,
      it makes it vulnerable to delays, congestion, and all
      the unpredictability of anything out of a user's
      control.

   "Emerging Role For the C.I.A.: Economic Spy."
      During the Clinton Administration's tense negotiations
      with Japan last spring Mickey Kantor received inside
      information gathered by the C.I.A.'s Tokyo station and
      the electronic eavesdropping equipment of the N.S.A.
      "But in the end, did it help much? Beyond some valuable
      detail we could not have gotten elsewhere, did it tell
      us much about which way Hashimoto would go? It would be
      hard to make that case."
      Many Administration officials suggest that the agency
      simply does not have the talent for such analysis. "The
      best graduate students don't go there and who can blame
      them?" said one of the Administration's top economic
      officials. "And yet, when you sit in a meeting, the
      views of the C.I.A. are often given more weight than the
      Council of Economic Advisors. Go figure."
      Allan E. Goodman, a former C.I.A. official and academic
      dean of Georgetown University's School of Foreign
      Service, said "We don't have the sources, we don't have
      the expertise. To develop an understanding of the people
      who trade currencies, their motivations, their
      lifestyles, you'd have to send your people to Harvard,
      Stanford and Wharton for years. Currency traders keep
      secrets very, very well, and to penetrate that would be
      the equivalent of cracking all the Japanese codes in

   "The New Watchdogs of Digital Commerce."
      Think of them as a truth squad of cyberspace, these
      crusading graduate-student hackers from Berkeley. "This
      is a tradition of unfettered inquiry and curiosity,"
      said John Gilmore, "for hackers, nothing is sacred and
      everything is subject to verification before you can
      really believe it."
      "The hacker ethic is transferring some of its better
      lessons to the world of commerce," said Steven Levy,
      "we're groping for a way to use the Net in a way where
      information will flow freely and people can still make
      money. The hackers are going to help us find ways to
      have a more humanized system of commerce."
   "Will Netscape be the next Microsoft, or the next victim of
   Microsoft?"
      Some investors believe Netscape could become "the next
      Microsoft." Other people believe that Netscape could
      become the next Microsoft victim, and that the next
      Microsoft is none other than Microsoft itself.
      All these new features of Navigator 2.0 send a clear
      notice to the industry that Netscape has no interest in
      bowing to the traditional Internet procedures for
      setting software standards by academic and scientific
      committee. The Internet has become primarily a
      commercial medium, where standards are set by whoever
      has the highest market share. It is a concept Microsoft
      knows well, and one that Netscape has grasped.

The New Yorker of October 23 reports on the "Supernote,"
   a perfect counterfeit $100-bill allegedly being used for
   economic terrorism.
      The Supernote had surfaced around 1990 and originated in
      the Middle East. It was no ordinary counterfeit. The
      workmanship was extraordinary. When a sample first
      arrived at the Secret Service's laboratory, a top
      technical analyst "examined it the way he has every
      other counterfeit note in the world, and called it
      genuine." Most alarming of all, the Supernote was so
      well engineered that it could fool currency scanners at
      the nation's twelve Federal Reserve banks.
      Today, the Supernote remains one of the longest unsolved
      counterfeiting cases in the modern history of the Secret
      Service, and it has begun to undermine international
      confidence in United States currency.
      The Treasury, taking its cue from the Federal Reserve,
      has a difficult time regarding counterfeiting, even on
      a very large scale, as a macroeconomic problem, because
      cash is a relatively small percentage of the total money
      supply. Wire transfers, checks, and credit-card
      transactions, after all, run into the trillions.
      Counterfeiting becomes significant to the Fed only if it
      undermines confidence in the dollar.
      Dozens of interviews with high-level insiders left the
      impression that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury
      don't fear the Supernote itself as much as they fear a
      confidence problem that might result if they publicly
      acknowledge it and countenance a large-scale
      investigation. (As one expert on international terrorism
      who has looked into the Supernote puts it, "If the note
      is that nearly perfect, it doesn't exist.")

      viable international electronic money will be available

      Disaster, because governments and central banks in

      that currency issue brings, and the sovereignty it is
      supposed to provide (but may not). Disaster, because it
      would destroy two central aims of Emu: the sharing of
      power between monetary authorities, and the attempted
      imposition of currency soundness by institutional fiat.
      Nirvana, because it would provide people with a powerful

   "Privacy Groups Assail FBI's Wiretapping Plan" [Excerpt]
   James Kallstrom, assistant FBI director in charge of the

   fact reduce the FBI's surveillance authority. "Today ... we
   could tap all the phones in the United States," he said,
   referring to older, pre-digital technology. Under the plan,
   the FBI's surveillance ability would shrink to a maximum of
   1 percent of simultaneous telephone calls from any one
   telephone switch, he said.
   Kallstrom said a typical central switching office in New
   York that serves 50,000 telephone lines has a capacity to
   carry only 5,000 calls simultaneously. It is the latter
   number, not the former, he said, on which the FBI bases its
   calculations. So the highest level of simultaneous
   surveillance in that area, he said, would be 50 lines.
   "We've never done that many" taps at one time, he said. But
   in a "worst-case scenario," such as a major act of
   terrorism, the agency might need such ability, he said. "I
   think it's a reasonable, minimal, conservative number."

The Washington Post, November 8, 1995.
   Return of the Cyber-Censors [Editorial]
   When the Senate passed its ill-advised "Exon amendment" to
   the telecommunications bill last spring, which would
   criminalize the transmission of obscene, pornographic or
   "indecent" material on the Internet, the measure got an
   overwhelming 84 votes, many of them from senators who
   didn't understand the implications of the move. Only a few
   weeks later, the House went even more overwhelmingly the
   other way, voting 420 to 4 for an amendment (co-sponsored
   by Reps. Ron Wyden and Christopher Cox) that would bar the
   Federal Communications Commission from regulating
   cyberspace and would instead make it legally easier for
   commercial Internet providers to use their own technical
   tools to regulate questionable material.
   The contrast was the result of a burst of public discussion
   in which more technologically astute members, including
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, caught on to the disturbing
   fact that the kinds of far-reaching liability imposed by
   Sen. James Exon's formulation -- hastily adapted from an
   existing measure on telephone transmission -- would cripple
   practically any commercial Internet provider and
   effectively lame the new medium as a venue for moneymaking
   activity.
   Now these vastly different measures are in conference
   committee along with the rest of the telecommunications
   bill (in other areas of which, we remind readers once
   again, The Washington Post Co. has some interests). But the
   seeming clarity afforded by the House response to the Exon
   amendment and by Mr. Gingrich's appreciation of the need
   for untrammeled development of the new medium is nowhere to
   be seen. A letter from Christian Coalition head Ralph Reed,
   Phyllis Schlafly and other prominent spokesmen for the
   religious right is urging the conferees toward an
   Exon-style approach that's as destructive now as it ever
   was. The House bill also could end up including an
   amendment sponsored by Rep. Henry Hyde that adds some
   criminal liability to the transmission of obscene (but not
   "indecent") images via the new technologies.
   The argument against "criminalizing" the transmission of
   "indecent" images via the Internet remains stark and
   simple, and it goes not to the awfulness of child
   pornography or even to the ability of parents to control
   what their children do on the computer (a wide variety of
   off-the-shelf technological filters now exist that let
   parents do this themselves) but to the impossibility of
   regulation by the electronic middleman industries that are
   developing.
   Commercial providers such as America Online continue to
   pass along millions of messages a day, the interactive
   "newsgroups" unfold quickly and internationally, and the
   kind of central filtering envisioned by would-be regulators
   erases the very quality that makes the Internet a live and
   promising medium -- its inexpensive accessibility. If the
   Internet were like a telephone system, there would at least
   be the possibility of identifying a specific "sender" and
   "recipient." On the Internet it's "receivers" who do the
   selecting of what to look at and where. Giving those
   recipients the tools they need remains the way to go. The
   conferees should resist the urge to censor cyberspace.

The New York Times, November 8, 1995.    Industry Group Rebuffs U.S. On Encryption
   By John Markoff
   The campaign by the Clinton Administration to create a
   standard for data encryption acceptable to industry, civil
   liberties and law enforcement groups broke down yesterday
   when a group including some of the nation's most powerful
   technology companies rejected a compromise proposal.
   The aim is to set a policy that meets the needs of
   electronic commerce as well as the concerns of the National
   Security Agency and other Federal offices that are opposed
   to the proliferation of data-coding software, feeling it
   will make it impossible for them to gather intelligence
   overseas.
   The Administration offered a compromise plan and had been
   seeking comment from the public. But the industry coalition
   said yesterday that it found the Government unwilling to
   compromise. Thus, the group of 37 companies said, it would
   formulate its own policy proposal to present to the White
   House and to Congress in the next six months.
   High-technology industries want a data-coding standard
   secure enough that both businesses and overseas customers
   could use it for sensitive financial and business
   correspondence. They seek a longer and more powerful
   encryption key than the Government is willing to grant, and
   object to Government demands that law enforcement agencies
   have "back-door" access to such transmissions that would
   allow them to intercept coded messages.
   The letter is signed by several of the country's leading
   computer, software and on-line companies, among them
   America Online, Apple Computer, AT&T, Eastman Kodak
   I.B.M.'s Lotus Development division, MCI Communications,
   Microsoft, Novell, Oracle Sybase and Tandem Computers.
   On Aug. 17, the Administration proposed a liberalization of
   export-control procedures for "key escrow" software
   products, or those providing law-enforcement access.
   "The current policy directive also does not address the
   need for immediate liberalization of current export
   restrictions," the letter said "Such liberalization is
   vital to enable U.S. companies to export state-of-the-art
   software products during the potentially lengthy process of
   developing and adopting a comprehensive national
   cryptography policy."

   Encryption Control Plan Sparks Industry Protest
      High-Tech Groups Say Proposals Unworkable
   By Elizabeth Corcoran
   High-technology companies and advocacy groups are writing
   to Vice President Gore and House Speaker Newt Gingrich to
   protest what they contend are unworkable federal proposals
   for controllng the export of data scrambling technology.
   The letters deepen an industry-government rift that began
   only days after federal officials unveiled an outline of
   what they hoped would be a palatable plan at an industry
   meeting in August.
   Two separate coalitions are criticizing the
   administration's draft proposal, which the government
   circulated on the Internet on Monday.
   Current export regulations prohibit companies froan sending
   overseas any encryption, or data-scrambling technology,
   that exceeds a certain degree of sophistication. The
   government argues that it needs to be able to peek at
   messages and files with proper court authorization -- to do
   its job of protecting U.S. citizens from terrorist groups
   and other malevolent organizations.
   In July, some French students demonstrated they could
   readily break the type of encryption technology that the
   U.S. government lets companies export. In August, the
   administration said it would let companies include more
   complex types of encryption, provided they pledged to
   entrust to an authorized agent a "spare key," or the means
   for unscrambling the information.
   Unlike early proposals in which the government said it
   would hold such keys, the administration is suggesting that
   companies and individuals would be able to select private
   keyholders, much the way people pick their banks.
   But after a brief honeymoon, industry and civil liberties
   groups began to find flaws with the details in the new
   proposals. This week's letters indicate that whatever
   fragile compromise the government had hoped it had found
   has grown even weaker.
   One coalition, pulled together by the Washington advocacy
   group Center for Democracy and Technology, includes about
   three dozen high-tech companies and associations. The group
   has promised to draft an alternative plan within six
   months.
   "There is a very serious message here: that national
   security can't be controlling the Internet," said Jerry
   Berman, executive director of the center. "There are other
   issues, global competitiveness and privacy, that need to be
   placed in the balance -- and the administration's policy
   doesn't do that."
   A second coalition of about 10 free-market and libertarian
   groups, led by another policy group, Americans for Tax
   Reform, plans to send their letter to Gingrich in the next
   day or two. The group contends the administration's
   encryption proposals are an encroachment on citizens' civil
   rights.
   The administration's proposals would not restrict tbe
   encryption technologies that people use within U.S.
   boundaries. But it would require that if they
   electronically send an encrypted message to parties outside
   the United States, a spare key must be stored with an
   authorized agency.
   "Even though we recognize [the administration] has worked
   hard on its proposals, it's not the right direction," said
   Rebecca Gould, director of policy at the Business Software
   Alliance, a trade association of software firms.
   "We've been in this [debate] since July 1994," she added,
   a long time for companies that churn out a new version of
   most products every 18 months. "That means lost sales for
   us and a loss of U.S. industry sales abroad."

   The political right has joined the opposition to the
   Clinton Administration's proposed restriction on the export
   of data-coding systems.
   A group of 12 conservative organizations -- including the
   National Rifle Association, Americans for Tax Reform and
   the Competitive Enterprise Institute -- sent a letter
   yesterday to House Speaker Newt Gingrich protesting
   Administration efforts to limit the export of cryptographic
   software and hardware.
   Calling the proposal anti-consumer, anti-business and
   anti-progress, the groups urged Mr. Gingrich to support the
   relaxation of export controls. "The Administration's
   approach is the wrong policy for today's marketplace," the
   letter stated.
   The letter to Mr. Gingrich followed one sent on Tuesday to
   Vice President Al Gore from 37 corporate and publicpolicy
   groups, including the Microsoft Corporation and America
   Online Inc. The letter to Mr. Gore opposed Administration

   Neural Networks
   Neural nets aren't terribly useful for cryptanalysis,
   primarily because of the shape of the solution space.
   Neural nets work best with problems that have a continuity
   of solutions, some better than others. This allows a neural
   net to learn, proposing better and better solutions as it
   does. Breaking an algorithm provides for very little in the
   way of learning opportunities: You either recover the key
   or you don't. (At least this is true if the algorithm is
   any good.) Neural nets work well in structured environments
   where there is something to learn, but not in the
   high-entropy, seemingly random world of cryptography.

   The Wall Street Journal, November 14, 1995, p. A15.
   This Is the CEO -- Get Me the CIA [Op-Ed, excerpts]
   By Ernest Brod. (Mr. Brod is executive managing director of
   Kroll Associates, an international investigation, business
   intelligence and security frim based in New York.)
   While government policy makers ponder and debate [economic
   espionage] issues, U.S. companies are fighting the global
   competitiveness battle. In the past year U.S. companies
   have rushed to level the playing field with foreign
   competitors who have long exploited the advantage of
   competitor intelligence. For years, foreign-based
   multinationals have had teams of people devoted to learning
   as much as they could about their U.S. competitors. The
   methods ranged from in-depth research and analysis of
   publicly available information to covert and sometimes
   clumsy attempts at industrial espionage, in some cases with
   the active support of their government's intelligence
   agencies.
   Today, having had their consciousness raised by the global
   business realities of the '90s, U.S. companies in all
   industries are scrambling to set up units devoted to
   gathering strategic information about the competition.
   Teams can be found at both corporate and division levels;
   they may be multi-department or reside within planning,
   development, marketing, finance or international units.
   They may have euphemistic labels and they increasingly draw
   upon burgeoning numbers of outside private resources.
   In recent months, for example, my firm was asked to help
   determine:
   + Whether an Asian competitor will take advantage of the
   North American Free Trade Agreement to establish facilities
   in Mexico in order to supply the U.S. market.
   + How an overseas competitor with an apparently comparable
   cost base can consistently produce lower bids.
   + Who controls an overseas private company and how deep are
   their pockets.
   While the controversy continues over whether U.S. companies
   should be favored with government-sponsored industrial
   intelligence, managers are already employing legal and
   ethical research and investigative techniques to learn more
   about the methods, resources and plans of their marketplace
   adversaries.
   These forays may not be exciting, risky or glamorous enough
   for our battle-hardened spy masters, but they help American
   strategists win hard-fought ground from their adversaries.

   "When Patients' Records Are Commodities for Sale."
      Individual medical records, carrying more sensitive
      personal information than ever before, are increasingly
      being gathered and stored by the tens of thousands in
      commercial databanks maintained by institutions like
      hospital networks, health maintenance organizations and
      drug companies. And although there is a Federal law that
      protects the privacy of video rental lists, private
      medical information is being bought and sold freely.
      The issue of medical privacy touches virtually everyone.
      "It is true to say that if you know a person's history
      of health problems, then you know more about that person
      than you would with any other data," said Lawrence O.
      Gostin, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
      And as medical records start including new genetic
      information that can predict diseases likely to show up
      in years to come, they will be able to reveal "not just
      health histories, but health futures," Mr. Gostin said.
      Yesterday hearings were held on a bill called the
      Medical Records Confidentiality Act, intended to
      establish uniform Federal rules for the use and
      disclosure of health information.
      Although the bill details procedures for obtaining
      consent, it also establishes a formidable list of
      exceptions to this requirement. The police, health
      oversight agencies, health information services, public
      health offices and medical researchers are among those
      allowed to obtain records of an identified patient
      without that person's consent and, in many cases without
      notification.

   Another realm of explosive population increase is in
   cyberspace, a phenomenon taken up in this issue with Sherry
   Turkle's "Ghosts in the Machine." Here the growth comes
   about not only in the traditional way but also in wildly
   non-traditional ways. People multiply themselves on the
   Internet, grafting various aspects of their personalities
   onto distinct characters. Even more unsettling, as Turkle
   wittily documents the matter, is that the Net is populated
   with "bots": robot sentence-parsing engines that can do
   fair impersonations of real people, often well enough to
   (provisionally) pass Alan M. Turing's test for machine
   consciousness. Do you really know who -- or what -- you're
   talking to?
   The future of all this is murky and mind-boggling:
   Information-seeking bots even now can tie up sites on the
   World-Wide Web. Bots impersonating people share chat groups
   with other bots, much the way telephone answering machines
   now "talk" to each other. Internet chatter gets so dense
   that bandwidth and other Net resources become strained: the
   site at the Los Alamos National Laboratory now
   (automatically) warns robots away with a chilling threat to
   "initiate automated 'seek and destroy' " action against the
   machine from which the robot seems to be launched. A
   conservative reaction may already be setting in, determined
   to have users identify, encrypt and authenticate every
   packet of information they send across the Net.
   Net fatigue becomes a recognized medical syndrome; Net

   The university had investigated complaints of sexual

   applied to civilian applications -- points to the substance of the

      The End of Big Government And the New Paradigm Ahead
      By James P. Pinkerton
      Hyperion. 404 pp. $24.95
      In Pinkerton's account, bureaucracy survives today only
      because no one has yet developed a coherent replacement
      model." Instead we have deluded ourselves into thinking
      that periodic upgrading of what Pinkerton calls the
      "Bureaucratic Operating System" (BOS) -- in the same way
      that computer software is upgraded -- will enable us to
      avoid the gloomy prospect of life in the "Cyber Future,"
      his term for the horrific predicament of extreme
      inequality and hypercrime to which we are headed.
      At one point Pinkerton suggests that a parallel for Bill
      Clinton may be found in Mikhail Gorbachev. Both leaders
      "shrank from genuine perestroika" after their peoples
      had come to the realization that the system itself was
      the problem.
      Displaying a sure grasp of popular culture, technology
      and political history, Pinkerton writes engagingly and
      insightfully about the defects and malfunctionings of
      the American bureaucratic state. His refreshing analyses
      of the flaws in bureaucratic thinking are among the best
      that we have on the subject and, surely, the wittiest.

Picking up on Tim's and Atilla's comments on Netscape, GAK,
   a WTO czar and government regulation of security on the
   Net:
   Jim Clark's speech was probably a trial balloon, to see
   what the reaction would be. Remember that the NIST
   conference on KE is December 5.
   It would make sense for the corporations to welcome
   application of police power to handle threats to public
   order, in cyberworld like the other. That way they reduce
   culpability for failures of their private security systems,
   as they do on private real estate property.
   Key escrow requires someplace for the buck to stop beyond
   several private pitstops, and that is usually Uncle Sugar
   when no other party has the resources to withstand
   sustained, substantial, culture-wide risk -- as, say, in
   the financial realm. Internationally, the same need exists.
   Probably the corporations  would like to work in concert
   with governments on this, so no single firm, or nation,
   gets stigmatized, or wounded and prey to vultures -- as
   Netscape was with the brute hack, and as Microsoft and
   others have been with other attacks on their lightly
   guarded property, or as the US might be if it does not work
   out international agreements.
   Moreover, it has been noted here that government contracts
   are crucial for a new company -- for testing, for
   credibility, for prestige. All the major players already
   have such vital contracts -- indeed most would not have
   thrived without them -- so why would Netscape, and its    investors, not want them too?
   It's possible that Netscape was selected to sound off on KE
   to see if it could play with the Big Boys -- take the heat,
   pass initiation, qualify for the Bohemian Grove bear hugs
   of assured stability, growth and profits.
   Could be, though, that after getting stable R/E for his    backers, Jim will be confident enough to join Pixar in that    rhumba risk of mercurial, evanescent mass-marketers.

Rasping rawbutts for National Whiners Day here's a duo    of pinhole puckers about the shut-your-filthy-hole bill:
   The Wash Post, Dec 25, 1995:
   Internet Football
   The Internet provisions are still in flux along with the
   rest of the host telecommunications bill, in which this
   newspaper and its parent company have an interest. If these
   provisions go through in anything like their present form,
   then their vulnerability to challenge on First Amendment
   grounds seems clear. It makes sense for a court to sort out
   the constitutional from the technical aspects of this new
   form of "speech," and the sooner the better.
   It won't be easy. The main legal questions about the
   proposed Internet indecency regulations as they now stand
   are inextricably wound up with technical issues. Can the
   "transmitters" of material that is deemed "indecent" ensure
   to a reasonable degree of certainty that underage computer
   users cannot get to it? If they fail, how can they show
   they tried? Several ideas here are flags for trouble.
   No legally solid test exists for the "indecency" standard
   now in the regulations -- patterned on those used for
   earlier dial-a-porn legislation but addressing totally
   different technologies. The coalition of moderate conferees
   had tried to replace the term with the more explicit
   "harmful to minors" but failed by a single vote. The
   Justice Department said in a letter last week that a
   "harmful to minors" standard was more likely than
   "indecency" to pass scrutiny but that "an overly broad
   restriction would likely not withstand constitutional
   scrutiny regardless of the standard chosen."
   That brings up the meaning of "transmit." Who is
   responsible for "transmitting" a smutty text that, say, a
   high school student locates by using an ordinary commercial
   account to (1) find, download and install free software
   that searches the Web, (2) use that tool to find a
   pornographic bulletin board overseas, and (3) make a copy
   to store in his own computer?
   The regulations now would punish anyone who "uses any
   interactive computer service to display [indecent material]
   in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age."
   But the bulletin board overseas isn't subject to U.S. Iaw.
   Most likely it will be up to the commercial providers to
   demand ID for certain types of accounts -- or up to
   account-buying parents to limit the scope of their kids'
   accounts. Whether providers can actually wall off sectors
   of the electronic world without cooperation from the adults
   paying the bills has more to do with the available
   electronic gizmos than with the laws governing the world to
   which they give access.
   There is much complicated back-and-forth about whether
   providers such as America Online and Prodigy will be held
   responsible for the effectiveness of the measures they
   take. But only the courts can decide what truly works. A
   court muddled its way through the Prodigy case on this
   topic in New York State recently. It declined to modify its
   own judgment that the provider was more liable because it
   had tried to create a "PG bulletin board" than if it had
   not. Whether or not this stands, it's a measure of the
   disconnect that persists as this legislation stumbles
   toward final enaction.
   The NY Times, Dec 26, 1995:
   Mr. Hollings Saves the Phone Bill
   House and Senate conferees seemed ready to negotiate a
   damaging telecommunications compromise until Senator Ernest
   Hollings of South Carolina, the chief Senate negotiator,
   altered that destiny last week. Wielding the threat of a
   filibuster and a deft legislative hand, he rescued the best
   parts of flawed House and Senate bills passed earlier,
   added some good new ideas and threw out most of the rot.
   His draft bill could spark innovation and set off
   consumer-friendly competition among television, cable and
   telephone companies. Its biggest flaw is a heavy-handed and
   probably unconstitutional effort to ban "indecent material"
   from the Internet.
   The original bills sought to break down barriers that keep
   media companies from entering each other's markets. But
   three mistakes were made. The bills would have deregulated
   cable rates before competition by other video companies
   could protect customers from price-gouging cable operators.
   Local phone companies would have been allowed to enter the
   long-distance market before they faced competition from
   cable or other companies. Worse still, the bills would have
   allowed broadcasters, cable operators, telephone companies
   and newspapers to merge too easily. That could expose
   consumers to a frightening concentration of information
   sources.
   Mr. Hollings, with the help of key Republicans like Senator
   Larry Pressler, fixed most of these flaws. His draft bill
   would hold up entry of local phone companies into
   long-distance service until the Federal Communications
   Commission says O.K. after giving weight to an antitrust
   review by the Justice Department. The bill leaves it up to
   the F.C.C. to set reasonable guidelines for mergers. It
   would put off deregulation of most cable rates for three
   years -- enough time for phone and satellite services to
   take on cable operators.
   The one serious error is a prohibition against transmission
   of allegedly indecent materials over the Internet -- the
   network of millions of on-line computer subscribers around
   the world. The indecency standard is probably
   unconstitutionally vague and restrictive. The standard is
   also unnecessary. The law already forbids sending obscene
   materials by computer. To protect children, parents can buy
   easy-to-use programs that block indecent materials from any
   source. The draft bill threatens to trigger further
   Government control of electronic communication -- which has
   blossomed so far precisely because Government has stayed on
   the sidelines. Fortunately, Republican leaders like Speaker
   Newt Gingrich are troubled by the indecency standard. There
   is a good opportunity to knock the provision out before
   Congress takes a vote.
   Some Republicans, miffed when Vice President Al Gore
   declared the draft an Administration victory, threatened to
   withhold support. But telecommunications, the heart of a
   high-tech economy, is too important for small-minded
   sparring. Congress should take up the draft bill, remove
   the indecency provision and put Mr. Holling's good deed
   into law.
   [The coccyx of a 12-26-95 WSJ eunucher]:

   induces, entices, or coerces" a minor to engage in any
   illegal sexual act.

Financial Times, December 21, 1995, p. 4.
   Encryption rules to be prepared
   By Andrew Jack in Paris
   Representatives of international business and government
   yesterday agreed to draw up guidelines on encryption, a
   system which allows computer users to transmit information
   electronically with little risk that it can be intercepted
   and understood by unauthorised "hackers".
   The meeting, which was held at the International Chamber of
   Commerce in Paris, could lead to formal propositions
   prepared jointly by business and government organisations
   that could be ready by as soon as next summer.
   Yesterday's meeting did not have any formal legal
   authority, but was highly significant as the first forum
   where so many representatives of governments businesses and
   computer experts met to discuss developments in encryption.
   Highly sophisticated encryption technology already exists
   in a number of countries including the US and Sweden. In
   the US, companies already have access to these programs. A
   growing number of businesses -- led by the banking sector
   -- are demanding access to these programs.
   However, many governments, including that of the US, have
   resisted permitting the technology to be exported because
   they fear it will fall into the hands of organised crime
   and terrorist organisations.
   They have demanded that they should be able to "hack" into
   computer transmissions for counter-intelligence and
   criminal investigation work, in the same way that they can
   conduct telephone-tapping exercises.
   An important conclusion of yesterday's Paris meeting was
   that business agreed in principle to allow such hacking to
   take place as long as sufficient safeguards were in place
   and "electronic search warrants" had been issued with
   proper judicial approval.
   A number of governments appear willing to permit relaxation
   of export controls on sophisticated encryption devices as
   long as these safeguards are in place.
   Among the issues that experts on both sides need to resolve
   are the ways in which "keys" allowing computer
   transmissions to be decoded would be handled.
   A number of business organisations have discussed the use
   of third-party organisations, which would be independent of
   government, would have the keys and would hand them over to
   government investigators when demands were justified.
   However, the organisations still have to resolve a number
   of issues, including how these custodians could be made
   legally liable for any unauthorised access to this
   information and for the costs of its misuse.

The WSJ and Financial Times report today on The New
   Transatlantic Agenda, the trade and security pact signed by
   the US and Europe yesterday to "boost cooperation."
      [WSJ] The accord's center piece commits the parties to
      working together on 150 specific policy areas, including
      cutting trade barriers, strengthening cooperation in
      nuclear nonprofliferation and fighting international
      crime.
      "There are mixed urges in Europe right now," says Kirsty
      Hughes, head of the European program at the Royal
      Institute for International Affairs in London. "On one
      hand, the nations of Europe want to keep the U.S.
      involved in European affairs, and on the other, they
      want to develop their own economic, political and
      security arrangements."
   Then, the Fin Times piece, headlined "Clinton and EU
   leaders agree on crime," reports on a variety of issues but
   mentions only in passing the phrase "crime, drugs and
   terrorism."
   This treatment suggests that there is more boosting of
   security and crime-fighting cooperation than the press is
   reporting -- or privy to.
   Recall recent reports on:
      A World Trade Organization cyberspace czar to bring law
      and order to the unruly Net.
      EU plans for setting standards and certifications for
      products, including software for computer security,
      encryption and authentication.
      The future threat to "the West" by a hyper-cyber Asia
      [ex-colonies] deploying information wizardry to level
      the playing field.
   Cooperation on trade and "crime, drugs and terrorism" might
   then be a euphemism for economic aggression -- US-EU
   international affairs arranged to maximize benefits for
   transatlantic self-interests.
   If so, then cryptography is truly a highly valuable
   munitions for economic warfare, worthy of the strongest law
   and enforcement measures, closely fit to the power of the
   weapon. With US-EU GAK and ITAR to protect markets of the
   transatlantic super-nation and selected meta-atlantic
   partners in crime-pure joy.

   Quantum Computers, Factoring, and Decoherence
   I. L. Chuang, R. Laflamme, P. W. Shor, W. H. Zurek
   [First paragraph] The uniqueness of the prime
   factorization of a positive integer is the Fundamental
   Theorem of Arithmetic. In practice, the determination of
   the prime factors of a given number can be an exceedingly
   difficult problem, even though verification is trivial.
   This asymmetry is the basis for modern cryptography and
   provides secret codes used not only on your own bank card
   but also to transfer diplomatic messages between embassies.
   [Precis] It is known that quantum computers can
   dramatically speed up the task of finding factors of large
   numbers, a problem of practical significance for
   cryptographic applications. Factors of an L-digit number
   can be found in ~L^2 time [compared to ~exp(L^1/3) time] by
   a quantum computer, which simultaneously follows all paths
   corresponding to distinct classical inputs, obtaining the
   solution from the coherent quantum interference of the
   alternatives. Here it is shown how the decoherence process
   degrades the interference pattern that emerges from the
   quantum factoring algorithm. For a quantum computer
   performing logical operations, an exponential decay of
   quantum coherence is inevitable. However, even in the
   presence of exponential decoherence, quantum computation
   can be useful as long as a sufficiently low decoherence
   rate can be achieved to allow meaningful results to be
   extracted from the calculation.

   Unmuzzling the Internet [OpEd]
      How to evade the censors and make a statement, too.
   By Jaron Lanier (Visiting scholar at the Columbia
   University department of computer science.)
   If President Clinton signs the telecommunications bill
   drastically restricting private as well as public speech on
   the Internet, he can expect a rollicking cat-and-mouse
   game.
   It can be comical when politicians try to control something
   they do not understand. Such is the case with the bill's
   censorship provision, which not only outlaws the
   transmission of material over the Internet that would be
   allowed in most newspapers, but also makes owners of
   computers on a network liable for the speech of others. (As
   Compuserve demonstrated last week when, to satisfy a German
   court, it blocked American subscribers' access to sexually
   explicit material, regulation of the Internet can threaten
   both commercial and constitutional freedoms.)
   The other day, I came up with a way to easily evade the
   proposed American restrictions. My simple idea would be to
   create a computer program, dubbed "Unmuzzle," which would
   deposit incomprehensible fragments of any forbidden
   material in different foreign computers (though maybe not
   Germany's). The contraband communication would only be
   reassembled into a coherent whole when downloaded in the
   home of the user back in the United States, where it would
   become protected speech, as in any other medium.
   I had no intention of actually building "Unmuzzle," but I
   mentioned the notion in E-mail to a friend, and within days
   I was hearing from people I didn't know who were busy
   creating the program with the idea of distributing it
   freely. Fine with me. Such a program would make an mportant
   statement.
   Speaking as someone who has been involved with computers
   for most of my life (I coined the phrase "virtual reality"
   in the early 1980's and created much of the technology for
   it), I find that many Internet users have been reacting to
   attacks on freedom in cyberspace by slumping into a
   separatist, angry mood. They feel that they are being
   denied the rights that others enjoy.
   On the Internet, separatism is expressed by encryption: an
   encrypted message can be read only by the party it is
   intended for. Therefore, in the spirit of the First
   Amendment, I suggest Unmuzzle as an alternative method: it
   may break up images or text into a hundred pieces, but they
   are still accessible to the public.
   The idea of censoring the Internet should be unthinkable,
   especially in the United States. Aside from the question of
   free speech, there's the economic imperative as well. The
   Internet is not a plaything: it is the infrastructure of
   our information technology industry.
   The young have the most to lose from the new restrictions,
   in spite of the fact that such limits are purportedly meant
   to protect them. Schools and libraries will find it
   extremely difficult to offer vital Internet services in the
   face of a mine field of criminal liabilities.
   It is members of Congress and the President who need to
   show some maturity, by rejecting free-speech restrictions
   in the telecommunications bill.

   In Search Of Computer Security
   By John Markoff
   Computer security is making a transition from the
   university and the research laboratory to the real world.
   So far it is proving to be a rocky evolution.
   Last year, a series of embarrassing gaffes and shortcomings
   undermined the faith of potential computer users in the
   certainty that their data are secure. The flaws have led to
   a growing realization that computer security systems are
   largely untested and that in complex environments like the
   Internet, they do not always respond the way their creators
   had intended.
   Paul C. Kocher, a computer security expert who discovered
   one potential flaw, said, "Many of the security systems
   that I am examining are good enough to keep out casual
   snoopers, but they're failing catastrophically when it
   comes to protecting data against determined attacks."
   The problems are emerging as the computer industry
   increasingly relies upon an arcane mathematical discipline
   that is intended to hide the secrets embedded in digital
   information behind a veil of imposing math problems.
   Cryptography, the science of writing secrets, was for
   centuries largely the province of kings, soldiers and
   spies. But that has changed in the 1990's as the world has
   rushed to use personal computers and computer networks as
   the basis for electronic commerce, communication and
   entertainment.
   Data scrambling has become the key to a vision that it will
   be possible to have private electronic conversations and
   secure financial transactions.
   In principle, data coding protects information by
   scrambling it to keep it out of the reach of everybody but
   those with a supercomputer and tens or even hundreds of
   years to crunch the data.
   But computer researchers have begun discovering flaws,
   sometimes subtle and sometimes glaring, that can help
   criminals take devious shortcuts to obtain the mathematical
   keys used to scramble the data.
   In August, a French computer hacker proved that it was
   possible to use a network of work stations to guickly find
   the secret key created by a coding system developed by the
   Netscape Communications Corporation, the leading developer
   of World Wide Web software.
   The feat cast doubts on the security of a system whose
   security had been scaled back to meet stringent United
   States Government export controls.
   The following month, two computer science graduate students
   at the University of California at Berkeley reported a flaw
   in the Netscape that would permit a technically skilled
   attacker to steal data by circumventing the complex
   calculations needed to break the code.
   In October, a team of Berkeley researchers, including the
   two computer science students, detailed security weaknesses
   in the fundamental software of the Internet that make it
   difficult to protect data that is sent between computers.
   And last month, Mr. Kocher explained a potential flaw in a
   widely used data coding approach known as public-key
   cryptography.
   The flaw could allow eavesdroppers to infer a secret key
   used to protect data in Internet security software,
   electronic payment smart cards and related systems by
   carefully timing how long it takes to compute the secret
   key.
   Mr. Kocher said that while he believed that trusted
   electronic security systems would ultimately emerge, there
   should be no urgency to rush their deployment.
   Banks have spent several hundred years perfecting systems
   for protecting money, he noted, but they have far less
   experience with the new computerized systems designed to
   protect information that represents money.
   One of the pioneers in the mathematics underlying most
   public key systems agrees that prudence is required in
   developing digital commerce.
   "Paul's discovery is one more piece of evidence that
   designing security mechanisms is tricky," said Whitfield
   Diffie, a Sun Microsystems researcher who was one of the
   co-inventors of the original public key technology.
   "Given the trust that we will be placing in systems for
   electronic commerce," he continued, "we should be putting
   all the effort we can into getting them right."

Jonathan Littman, an investigative reporter, has published
   "The Fugitive Game: Online With Kevin Mitnick," Little
   Brown, 1996. 381 pp. $23.95. ISBN 0-316-52858-7.
   It is a dramatic recount of Mitnick's exploits; the pursuit
   by Shimomura, Markoff, telcos and Feds; the bust and
   Markoff's tales; The Well controversies aand disputes about
   what really happened; suspicions of Shimomura and Markoff -
   - their complicity with TLAs, their movie and book
   dealings, their disputes with hackers and journalists. What
   Mitnick was telling Littman while a fugitive.
   Littman ends with this letter from Markoff and Shimomura:
   October 8, 1995
   Jonathan Littman
   38 Miller Avenue Suite 122
   Mill Valley, California 94941
   Dear Jonathan,
   This is in response to your separate letters to us. We
   apologize for not being more prompt, Tsutomu was travelling
   on business and did not receive your September 5 letter
   until recently. As you know we have a contract with
   Hyperion for Tsutomu's account of his participation in the
   arrest of Kevin Mitnick, and at the request of our
   publisher we have decided not to participate in other books
   on the same subject.
   First, in response to your September 7 request to John
   Markoff, for permission to reprint his March 14 Well
   posting, he is not willing to give permission.
   However, we do think it is appropriate to respond to
   several points where you have received inaccurate
   information.
   Our responses are not intended to be a comprehensive answer
   to your list of questions, but only to protect you from
   including libelous material in your book.
   Tsutomu was not asked by any governmental, military or
   intelligence representative to assist in the capture of Mr.
   Mitnick. All of his actions were taken in response to
   requests for assistance from both The Well and Netcom to
   deal with extensive and persistent break-ins.
   Tsutomu's decision to tell John Markoff that he was
   travelling to Raleigh on Sunday morning was done without
   contact with any law enforcement agency. Markoff flew to
   Raleigh independently six hours later after discussing the
   possibility of a story with his editors at the New York
   Times. Markoff did not at any time assist or participate in
   any aspect of the investigation into Kevin Mitnick's
   activities; Markoff was there only as an observer in his
   role as a newspaper reporter.
   Moreover, in Raleigh on Sunday evening the Cellscope
   equipment was never placed in Markoff's car, and there was
   never any discussion about taking it out of the Cellular
   One engineer's van or about placing it in Markoff's car.
   Markoff parked his car near the cell site that night and
   then later drove back to his hotel.
   Tsutomu never told anyone from law enforcement that anyone
   had authorized or cleared Markoff's presence in Raleigh.
   Tsutomu was informed by the Justice Department that his
   actions on behalf of the Internet providers and the
   cellular telephone company during the course of the
   investigation were covered under their fraud detection and
   prevention exception granted to these organizations under
   the ECPA.
   Tsutomu did have discussions with the National Security
   Agency about funding computer security research, the
   results of which were to be placed in the public domain,
   however no research grant was ever made. Tsutomu was not
   aware of any statements made in the search warrant until
   many days after the arrest.
   Tsutomu did not lure Mitnick or anyone else into
   breaking-in to his computers. The attack was entirely
   unprovoked.
   No copies of any files allegedly stolen by Mitnick were
   provided by Tsutomu to anyone other than the legitimate
   owners.
   The first discussion of the possibility of a book on the
   subject of Kevin Mitnick's arrest took place on Thursday
   February 16, when John Markoff received a telephone call
   from John Brockman, a New York City literary agent,
   proposing a collaboration between Markoff and Shimomura.
   You will remember, we hope, that after his July 4, 1994
   article about the hunt for Mitnick, Markoff did not wish to
   pursue the subject of Mitnick's life as a fugitive and
   referred a free-lance article on the subject proposed by
   Playboy to you.
   Also please note that you are inaccurate in stating that
   Tsutomu requested immunity before testifying before
   Congress on April 1993.
   We realize this is a delicate issue for you because of your
   involvement and communication with Kevin Mitnick during the
   period he was a fugitive. However, since your questions
   suggest you believe there may have been something
   inappropriate in Tsutomu's cellular telephone software
   development work, if you do include material in your book
   along this line, journalistic ethics require you to include
   the following: Tsutomu, unlike Mitnick, in all of his
   computer security research over a fifteen year period, has
   always, whenever he has found a vulnerability, made it
   known to the appropriate people, whether CERT, or a private
   company at risk, or the United States Congress.
   Sincerely, (signed) John Markoff Tsutomu Shimomura

   Here's Littman on immunity for Shimomura (describing telco
   tracking Mitnick):
   Shimomura's brought along his own hacker's scanning rig.
   It's pretty basic, just an Oki 900 cellular phone and a
   hardware interface to his tiny HP Palmtop. One of
   Shimomura's friends -- who happens to be under federal
   indictment for illegal hacking -- cooked up the interface
   and helped write the software.
   Shimomura likes his computer-controlled cellular phone, but
   its use for tracking is limited. Its main purpose is to
   lock on a call and eavesdrop. It is illegal to use it to
   eavesdrop on calls. That's why Shimomura needed immunity
   from prosecution when he demonstrated his Oki scanner
   before Congress a couple of years ago. (p. 6)

      The CompuServe case demonstrates just how difficult it

      propaganda. The nation's internal security services are
      already struggling to combat the sophisticated use of

      further maintained that the approach simply won't work.
      In addition, critics voiced concern that CompuServe's

      take responsibility for information they didn't create.

Responding to msg by bdavis (Brian Davis) on Fri, 5 Jan  3:4  PM
   Here's Littman on what the Feds knew about Markoff at
   Raleigh (Orsak and Murphy are with Sprint Cellular; Kent
   Walker was US Attorney in San Francisco):
   Monday afternoon, Special Agent LeVord Burns sits by the
   coffee pot and vending machine at the Sprint switch and
   debates the legal issues with Shimomura. "Tsutomu wanted us
   to kick his door down," recalls Orsak, who along with
   Murphy, listened in. "Burns was talking about what warrants
   had been issued, what the FBI was going to do."
   Burns impresses Orsak. A well-built, bespectacled black man
   in a suit and tie, Burns looks like the kind of FBI agent
   that doesn't miss details. As Burns recounts Mitnick's
   background, Orsak is surprised by what the agent says about
   Mitnick. "Burns said there were a lot of guys that as far
   as national security went were a lot more dangerous than
   Mitnick -- that a lot of professional hackers are a lot
   more dangerous." To Orsak, cyberspace's Most Wanted Hacker
   doesn't sound all that threatening. "One of the more
   interesting things, I thought, was the FBI goes, 'As far as
   hackers go,' Mitnick was 'benign.' They didn't have
   evidence he was in it for the money."
   A little later, John Markoff and Shimomura's girlfriend,
   Julia Menapace, who just flew in, arrive at the switch.
   Orsak and Murphy invite Shimomura's team, Burns, and two
   other FBI agents from Quantico, Virginia, out to Ragazzi's,
   a casual Italian restaurant nearby. Orsak spreads out a
   Raleigh street plan on the checkered tablecloth and
   pinpoints Mitnick's location.
   "LeVord was telling us what his involvement was for the
   FBI," recalls Murphy. "It was light banter. LeVord assumed
   like we all did, that Markoff was just another guy out of
   California. Just another egghead. One of Tsutomu's."
   Markoff gets everyone's ear when he mentions Mitnick
   inspired the hit movie WarGames. "Markoff was filling us in
   on Mitnick's typical behavior, the different people Mitnick
   had run-ins with," recalls Murphy. "A guy in England, a guy
   in Princeton, one at Digital." Then, Markoff runs through
   some of Mitnick's aliases. One of the phony names rings a
   bell with Murphy. After dinner, the whole crew heads back
   to the switch, and just as Murphy suspected, he finds a
   memo describing a recent attempt by someone using the alias
   to social engineer a new bunch of MINs.
   Meanwhile, the FBI is bumping up against a technical
   problem. The agents had planned to install the FBI's own
   bulky scanning equipment in a rental van, but they can't
   find one. Murphy suggests using his co-worker Fred's
   minivan. Burns gives the idea the green light, and Orsak
   helps the agents set up and calibrate their equipment in
   Fred's van.
   Around midnight, Fred chauffeurs the two agents to circle
   the cell site to calibrate their scanning equipment. Fred
   and the FBI agents get to talking.
   "He [Fred] let the cat out of the bag," confides Murphy.
   "We didn't tell him not to say anything. We weren't trying
   to hide it, but we were also not trying to convey it. He
   told them Markoff wrote a book on this guy."
   The boys from Quantico aren't happy.
   "They freaked," recalls Murphy. "They thought Markoff would
   tip the guy [Mitnick] so he could write another book."
   One of the Quantico agents phones the Sprint switch to
   confirm Markoff's identity. "Me, Markoff, Tsutomu, and
   Julia were at the switch," remembers Murphy. "One of the
   Quantico guys was on the phone. He wanted to talk to
   Tsutomu."
   Murphy passes the phone to Shimomura.
   "He [Shimomura] wasn't about to lie," says Murphy of the
   tense moment. "He [Shimomura] was trying to evade a little
   bit. He said that Kent Walker knew about Markoff being
   there, which of course Walker did."
   Murphy, Markoff, and Menapace listen to Shimomura.
   "Kent knows about it," insists Shimomura to the agent from
   Quantico. "He's cleared through Kent."
   But Kent Walker later denied ever giving Shimomura such
   approval or knowing John Markoff was in Raleigh. Shimomura
   later disputed Murphy's account and said he "never told
   anyone from law enforcement that anyone had authorized
   Markoff's presence in Raleigh."

@_subject: Mitnik: latest? -- Long, watch it 
Perhaps Brian Davis will comment with the latest but here's
   Littman on Mitnick (and scans of Shimomura/Media/Feds)
   through October, 1995:
   As Tsutomu Shimomura launched his new careers as pitchman,
   author, movie subject, and video game designer, Kevin
   Mitnick sat in a Southern county jail. Mitnick wrote to me
   nearly every week on yellow legal paper in longhand,
   bemoaning the lack of a word processor as he recounted the
   hardships of jail. He told me he had been attacked and
   robbed by two inmates and barely avoided fights with
   several others. When he complained that the vegetarian diet
   he requested was limited to peanut butter sandwiches, and
   that his stress and stomach medication prescriptions
   weren't filled, he was moved to a tougher county jail.
   His grammar wasn't perfect, but his writing was
   surprisingly frank and descriptive. Mitnick punctuated his
   letters with Internet shorthand, noting the precise minute
   he began each letter, as if he were still online. He was
   bitter, but he hadn't lost his sense of humor. When his
   jailers admitted they'd read the letter Mike Wallace wrote
   him, inviting him to appear on 60 Minutes, Mitnick admitted
   the irony of him, of all people, complaining about other
   people reading his mail. "Poetic justice, eh? ..."
   Once in a while he'd slip in a tantalizing comment about
   his case. One week he'd appear to trust me, the next he'd
   wonder whether I would betray him. It was strange
   corresponding with the man the media and our government had
   cast as a twenty-first-century Frankenstein. Mitnick
   himself didn't seem sure of who or what he was. He asked
   whether I felt he should be given a long prison sentence.
   Did I think he was evil? Dangerous?
   When he was sent to his second jail, as a matter of policy
   the U.S. Marshals confiscated his books, his underwear, his
   toiletries. Mitnick was doing the worst prison "time"
   possible, because the Eastern District of North Carolina
   had no federal detention center. That meant he would have
   to defend himself without access to a law library, required
   by law in federal institutions. The nurse in Mitnick's
   second county jail cut his medication again, and on June
   18, his attorney filed a motion in federal court stating
   that Mitnick "was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with
   esophageal spasms." The attorney argued that the
   "deliberate indifference" to Mitnick's "serious medical
   needs" violated constitutional standards.
   Before a federal judge could order a hearing on the medical
   issues, Mitnick was transferred to his third North Carolina
   jail in as many months. "He [Mitnick] overextended his
   welcome," explained a deputy U.S. Marshal in Raleigh who
   preferred to remain anonymous. "It was time for a change of
   scenery. This happens with a lot of them. They get where
   they think they're running the place."
   Mitnick's third county jail was his worst yet. He shared a
   cell with seven other men. There was no law library, radio
   or television, and each inmate was allowed only two books
   at a time. Mitnick's were the Federal Criminal Code and the
   Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The eight men in Mitnick's
   cell were forced to share a single pencil stub that was
   taken away in the afternoon. Mitnick was allotted one sheet
   of paper a day.
   On April 10, 1995, John Dusenberry, Mitnick's public
   defender, filed a motion to suppress evidence and dismiss
   the indictment. He argued that the blank search warrants
   and the warrantless search of Mitnick's apartment violated
   the Fourth Amendment, which specifically prohibits
   unreasonable search and seizure.
   In the government's response, John Bowler, the Assistant
   U.S. Attorney in Raleigh, defended the blank search
   warrants, not an easy proposition in a free country. Bowler
   prefaced his argument by claiming, despite evidence to the
   contrary, that Shimomura tracked Mitnick on his own until
   February I4, just hours before his capture. The
   government's response to the issue of the blank search
   warrants was to blame Magistrate Wallace Dixon. Bowler
   asserted that the FBI had wanted to execute the search
   properly, but the magistrate had "upon his own initiative"
   insisted on signing the blank search warrants.
   But a judge never ruled on these arguments. The
   twenty-three-count indictment the Associated Press had
   hypothesized could land Mitnick 460 years in jail fell
   apart. The government abandoned its case in Raleigh,
   dismissing all but one of the counts in accepting a plea
   bargain from Mitnick that would likely get him time served,
   or at most eight months. The tiny story was buried in the
   back pages of the New York Times.
   "Kevin is going to come and face the music in L.A., where,
   of course, the significant case has always been," David
   Schindler, the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, told the L.A.
   Times. The newspaper said the prosecutor believed Mitnick
   would receive stiffer punishment "than any hacker has yet
   received," a sentence greater than Poulsen's four years and
   three months.
   Mitnick's letters revealed how Schindler planned to win the
   record prison term. Schindler was claiming losses in excess
   of $80 million, the amount that would garner the longest
   possible sentence for a fraud case according to the Federal
   Sentencing Guidelines. Nor would Schindler have to
   substantiate his claim. The government only had to
   "estimate" the loss. Mitnick's attorneys said the figure
   was grossly exaggerated, and added that the case rested on
   source code allegedly copied from cellular companies. There
   was no proof that Mitnick had tried to sell the code, and
   there was no evidence it could be sold for an amount
   approaching $80 million. But under the guidelines the
   absence of a profit motive was no obstacle to a long jail
   term. David Schindler was seeking an eight-to-ten-year
   sentence for Kevin Mitnick, about the same prison time
   doled out for manslaughter.
   The jailed hacker wasn't the only one whose feats were
   being hyped. By August of 1995, the advertisement in
   Publishers Weekly for Shimomura's upcoming book featured
   Mitnick's New York Times photo stamped with the caption HE
   COULD HAVE CRIPPLED THE WORLD. Declared the ad, "Only One
   Man Could Stop Him: SHIMOMURA."
   The hyperbole made me flash on what Todd Young had done in
   Seattle. The bounty hunter had tracked Kevin Mitnick down
   in a few hours with his Cellscope. Unauthorized to arrest
   him, he'd kept Mitnick under surveillance for over two
   weeks as he sought assistance. But the Secret Service
   didn't think the crimes were significant. The U.S.
   Attorney's Office wouldn't prosecute the case. Even the
   local cops didn't really care.
   When I met Young in San Francisco a couple of weeks after
   Mitnick's arrest, he was puzzled by the aura surrounding
   Shimomura and his "brilliant" capture of Kevin Mitnick. We
   both knew from independent sources that Shimomura had never
   before used a Cellscope. Young asked why the FBI would
   bring an amateur with no cellular tracking skills to
   Raleigh for the bust. If Shimomura's skill was measured by
   his ability to catch the hacker, then he was on a par with
   Todd Young, a thousand-dollar-a-day bounty hunter who never
   had the help of the FBI. The simple, unglamorous truth was
   that Kevin Mitnick, whatever his threat to cyberspace and
   society, was not that hard to find.
   I tried to get the government to answer Young's question
   about Shimomura's presence. I asked the San Francisco U.S.
   Attorney's Office and they suggested I ask the FBI. But the
   FBI had no comment. I asked Schindler, the Assistant U.S.
   Attorney in L.A., and he didn't have an answer. I asked
   Scott Charney, the head of the Justice Department's
   Computer Crime group, and he said he couldn't comment. I
   asked the Assistant U.S. Attorney who would logically had
   to have approved sending Shimomura three thousand miles to
   Raleigh, North Carolina. But Kent Walker oddly suggested I
   ask Shimomura for the answer.
   The response reminded me of what John Bowler, the Raleigh
   prosecutor, had said when I asked him how John Markoff came
   to be in Raleigh. He, too, had suggested I ask Shimomura.
   Shimomura seemed to be operating independently. outside of
   the Justice Department's control. Or was he running their
   show?
   The media appeared captivated by Shimomura's spell. Except
   for the Washington Post and The Nation, most major
   publications and the television networks accepted John
   Markoff's and Tsutomu Shimomura's story at face value.
   Kevin Mitnick's capture made for great entertainment.
   Not one reporter exposed the extraordinary relationship
   between Shimomura and the FBI. Most seemed to ignore the
   conflict of interest raised by the financial rewards
   Shimomura and Markoff received by cooperating with the FBI.
   A Rolling Stone magazine story condoned Markoff's actions,
   saying he had merely done what any journalist would do when
   presented with the possibility of a big scoop. The media
   critic for Wired suggested only that Markoff should have
   advised New York Times readers earlier of his personal
   involvement in capturing Mitnick.
   The media functioned as a publicity machine for Shimomura
   and the federal government, quickly churning out a round of
   articles arguing for tougher laws and greater security on
   the Internet. But the fury over what Assistant U.S.
   Attorney Kent Walker described as Mitnick's "billion
   dollar" crimes simply distracted the public from the real
   issues. Privacy intrusions and crime in cyberspace were old
   news, and a series of Internet break-ins after Mitnick's
   arrest proved the capture of cyberspace's most wanted
   criminal had changed little.
   The real story was that Internet providers, the new
   equivalent of phone companies on the information
   superhighway, appeared naive about how to investigate
   break-ins while protecting the privacy of their
   subscribers. After an FBI computer child-pornography
   investigation was made public in September of 1995, the
   Bureau revealed that it had read thousands of e-mail
   correspondences, and invaded the privacy of potentially
   dozens of citizens in the course of its investigation.
   Privacy activists complained that constitutional rights
   were being bulldozed, but the FBI announced the public
   should expect more of the same. "From our standpoint, this
   investigation embodies a vision of the type of
   investigatory activity we may be drawn to in the future,"
   said Timothy McNally, the special agent in charge.
   The government seemed to be promoting a hacker dragnet to
   make sure the Internet was crime free for the millions of
   dollars of commerce on its way. Kent Walker, the Assistant
   U.S. Attorney who left the Justice Department within weeks
   of Mitnick's arrest for a job with a Pacific Telesis spin-
   off, was one of the many government officials who claimed
   the FBI couldn't crack high-tech cases without people like
   Shimomura.
   Perhaps prosecutions would increase if the FBI bolstered
   its force with nonprofessionals. But where would that leave
   the law and the Constitution?

Perry's askance leads me to propose stealing Littman's

   the melodrama of unexpected human/technology malfunctions.
   True, only a bit of bare crypto in it, with Kevin advising
   Littman to use PGP so his Well mail could not be read -- as
   Kevin's e-mail to Littman was by Shimomura and Markoff.
   Littman says that was how Markoff learned of Kevin's and
   Littman's exchanges and why Markoff started hustling
   Littman for leads on Kevin to feed the trackers.
   Also, crypto-related: The fact that Shimomura's supposedly
   secret files were not protected by encryption or other
   security is what causes Littman and others to think there
   was a sting (perhaps with TLA help) rather than foolish

[Before it is publicized, KM describes for Littman the
   Christmas 1994 attack on Shimomura's systems as a "TCP/IP
   prediction packet attack." (. . .) below are by Littman.]
   Three days later, on January 23, Shimomura will describe
   the attack in a widely distributed public Internet post. IP
   source address spoofing and TCP/IP sequence number
   prediction are the technical terms Shimomura uses to
   describe it, much like Mitnick's description. But his
   analysis is extremely technical, and even some UNIX
   security experts find it tough going.
   That same day, about 2 P.M., CERT will blast out an
   advisory to its international mailing list of 12,000
   Internet sites in the United States, Germany, Australia,
   the United Kingdom, Japan, and other countries. The vaguely
   worded report is much less specific than Mitnick's
   one-minute explanation on the telephone. Most likely, CERT
   is trying to provide enough detail so Internet sites can
   protect themselves against future attacks without providing
   so much detail that it could encourage copycat attacks.
   On one level, the hack is simple, a clever strike at a
   basic weakness of the Internet. Computers on the Internet
   are often programmed to trust other computers. The Internet
   was created to share information, and the attack on
   Shimomura, just like the Robert Morris Internet Worm attack
   seven years before, exploits that trust.
   The Internet has its own way of sending e-mail or files.
   Messages or files are split into smaller digital chunks or
   packets, each with its own envelope and address. When each
   message is sent, it's like a flock of birds that migrates
   to a planned location and reunites as a flock at the
   destination. Computers on the Internet often act like great
   flocks of birds that trust one another too. And all it
   takes is one enemy bird to infiltrate the flock.
                               . . .
   On Christmas Day 1994 the attack begins.
   First, the intruder breaks into a California Internet site
   that bears the cryptic name toad.com. Working from this
   machine, the intruder issues seven commands to see who's
   logged on to Shimomura's workstation, and if he's sharing
   files with other machines. Finger is one of the common UNIX
   commands the intruder uses to probe Shimomura's machine. As
   a security professional Shimomura should have disabled the
   feature. Finger is so commonly used by hackers to begin
   attacks that 75 percent of Internet sites, or about 15
   million of the more than 20 million Internet users, block
   its function to increase security.
   The intruder's making judgment calls on the fly about which
   commands will help him uncover which machines Shimomura's
   workstation might trust. He works fast. In six minutes he
   deduces the pattern of trust between Shimomura's UNIX
   workstation and an unknown Internet server.
   Then the automatic spoofing attack begins. It will all be
   over in sixteen seconds. The prediction packet attack
   program fires off a flurry of packets to busy out the
   trusted Internet server so it can't respond. Next, the
   program sends twenty more packets to Shimomura's UNIX
   workstation.
   The program is looking for a pattern in the initial
   sequence numbers -- the numbers used to acknowledge receipt
   of data during communications. The program deciphers the
   returned packets by subtracting each sequence number from
   the previous one. It notes that each new initial sequence
   number has grown by exactly 128,000. The program has
   unlocked the sequence number key.
   Shimomura's machine has to be idle for the attack to
   succeed. New Internet connections would change the initial
   sequence number and make it more difficult to predict the
   key. That's why the hacker attacks on Christmas Day.
   The attack program sends packets that appear to be coming
   from the trusted machine. The packet's return or source
   address is the trusted machine's Internet address.
   Shimomura's workstation sends a packet back to the trusted
   machine with its initial sequence number. But flooded by
   the earlier flurry of packets, the trusted server is still
   trying to handle the earlier traffic. It's tangled up.
   Taking advantage of the gagged server, the attacking
   program sends a fake acknowledgment. It looks real because
   it's got the source address of the trusted server, and the
   correct initial sequence number. Shimomura's workstation is
   duped. It believes it's communicating with a trusted
   server.
   Now the attacking program tells Shimomura's obedient
   workstation to trust everyone. It issues the simple UNIX
   "Echo" command to instruct Shimomura's workstation to trust
   the entire Internet. At that point, Shimomura's personal
   and government files are open game to the world. It's more
   than a humiliating blow to the security expert. By making
   Shimomura's machine accessible from any Internet site, the
   intruder has masked his own location. He can return from
   anywhere.
   The hacker can't believe his good luck. The attack is only
   successful because Shimomura has not disabled the "R"
   commands, three basic commands that allow users to remotely
   log-in or execute programs without a password. Tens of
   thousands of security-conscious Internet sites,
   representing well over a million users, routinely block
   access to the R commands to avoid its well publicized abuse
   by hackers.
   It takes a few keystrokes and about thirty seconds to shut
   off the R commands on an Internet server. You don't even
   have to turn off the machine.
   Why didn't Shimomura do it?
                               . . .
   Mitnick laughs. "He's [Shimomura's] not happy. I have
   nothing to do with it. I'm just telling you what I hear
   through the grapevine."
   [Littman] "Who do you think might have done it?" I ask    the likely suspect. "How did he figure it out himself?"
   "He [Shimomura] realized that somebody had edited his
   wrapper log, which shows incoming connections. Somebody
   actually modified those logs, and then he was able to
   reconstruct what happened through these logs that were
   mailed to another site unbeknownst to the intruder."
   Mitnick's actually telling me the evidence Shimomura
   collected to figure out the attack. The wrapper is supposed
   to control connections to Shimomura's server and log all
   connection attempts. It failed to protect Shimomura but
   still it logged the hacker's spoofed connection, and a copy
   of the log was e-mailed off-site.
   "So you were asking me if there's a secure e-mail site?"
   Mitnick continues, his voice suddenly hard. "My answer is
   no. This guy in my estimation is the brightest in security
   on the whole Internet. He blows people like Neil Clift
   away. I have a lot of respect for this guy. 'Cuz I know a
   lot about him. He doesn't know anything about me,
   hopefully, but he's good.
   "On the Internet, he's one of the best in the world."
   [pp. 222-25]
   -----
   [KM] "I don't know what his motive is. I don't know
   the man at all. Alls I know is he's very technical and he's
   very good at what he does. He's in the top five."
   [JL] "What makes Shimomura so good?"
   [M] "When someone penetrates his system he knows what to
   look for. When you compile a program, it uses external
   files and libraries. This is the type of guy that would
   look at the access times of the files to try to figure out
   what type of program somebody was compiling. The guy's
   sharp."
   On UNIX systems it's possible to tell the last time a file
   was read. Mitnick's guessing that Shimomura could determine
   the type of application that was compiled (converted into
   the computer's most basic machine language) by examining
   the date stamps in certain system directories. He's also
   acknowledging he knows that the intruder compiled a program
   while he was on Shimomura's machine.
   Once again, Kevin Mitnick seems to have an amazing amount
   of detail on how Shimomura analyzes an attack.
   [M] "He's just very good at -- well, he's a spook. What do
   you expect? This is only what I hear in the grapevine." ...
   [L] "But does the grapevine say he's primarily a spook?"
   [M] "Unknown. He's good in security and he consults with
   companies like Trusted Information Systems, the people that
   develop Internet fire walls, and a lot of people in D.C.
   and the Virginia area."
   Trusted Information -- the name strikes a bell. Markoff
   quoted someone from Trusted Information in his front-page
   "Data Threat" article.
   [L] "Where is Trusted Information?"
   [M] "Oh, in Maryland, 301 area code. Baltimore, I believe."
   [L] "What are some of the Virginia companies Shimomura
   works with?"
   [M] "I just have the phone numbers," Mitnick reveals
   casually. "I haven't called them yet to see."
   [pp. 252-53]
   -----
   Why not ask John Markoff about the real reason he called me
   twice this morning?
   So I ask him about the Shimomura Newsweek story, and the
   odd reference to cellular phones. He comes back with a
   stunning revelation.
   "Somebody hit a different Tsutomu machine last summer and
   the NSA was pissed," Markoff tells me. "They freaked out.
   There's no question about it."
   Why didn't he mention this in his New York Times stories?
   Why create the false appearance Shimomura was first hacked
   Christmas Day?
   "But it was a different machine?" I ask.
   "Am I being interviewed here?"
   It strikes me as an odd question. Markoff was the one who
   called me twice in the space of an hour. Who's interviewing
   whom?
   "Let's get on the same wavelength," Markoff suggests. "I'm
   glad to share this stuff with you, but I want to know where
   it's going to show up. 'Cuz I'm pretty close to Shimo and
   it's an issue for me."
   Before I can respond, he starts talking about Shimomura
   again.
   "I wrote that profile of Tsutomu because after I mentioned
   him in the bottom of my story ["Data Threat"] I basically
   outed him and a million reporters were all over him."
   "He wasn't happy about that?"
   "No, Tsutomu loves it," Markoff says. "He's playing his own
   games.
   "I'II tell you it's unclear what was taken [referring to
   the Christmas hack], and point two, I can send you a public
   posting by an Air Force information warfare guy who
   described what was taken and their assessment of the
   damage.
   "And there are lots of little snips of code that a
   brilliant hacker could probably use. But Tsutomu's mind
   works in very cryptic ways. It's not clear that without
   Tsutomu you're going to be able to do anything with it.
   "Now in this break-in I don't actually think a lot of stuff
   was taken."
   This break-in? Just how many times was Shimomura hacked
   before Christmas?
   But I ask a different question. "Why would an Air Force guy
   post something?"
   "Oh, Tsutomu," Markoff casually replies. "He produced a lot
   of software for the Air Force."
   "Where would he post this?"
   "Oh, to a mailing list. A lot of people were concerned
   about what was taken from his [Shimomura's] machine. What
   they [the hacker] got was a lot of his electronic mail.
   Some of it's kind of embarrassing. [But] I don't think
   people are going to find new ways to attack the network
   based on this particular attack.
   "There is another issue," Markoff cautions in a serious
   tone.
   "Tsutomu is a very sharp guy, and it is not impossible that
   that was a bait machine, which is why I stayed away from
   the issue."
   Is Markoff implying Shimomura, a rumored NSA spy, laid a
   trap? And what about Markoff's New York Times articles?
   Were they part of the trap, too?
   "Think about it for a second," Markoff pauses dramatically.
   "And you get into this wilderness-of-mirrors kind of world.
   And a lot of people that are writing don't know everything,
   and I don't know everything.
   "I've been protecting him [Shimomura] for five years. I get
   the profile and the [Wall Street] Journal is on him. They
   don't know how close he is to the military. It would make
   perfect sense. Who knows what's on the code? The guy is in
   the counterintelligence business."

Shimomura on BPF, NSA and Crypto:
   One of the tools I modified for my work was a sophisticated
   piece of software called the Berkeley Packet Filter. ...
   Unlike the original BPF, my version was designed to bury
   itself inside the operating system of a computer and watch
   for certain information as it flowed through the computer
   from the Internet. When a packet from a certain address, or
   for that matter any other desired piece of information
   designated by the user flashed by, BPF would grab it and
   place it in a file where it could be kept for later
   viewing.
   I had developed my initial version of the faster BPF in the
   expectation that I would receive additional research
   funding for the work from the National Security Agency. The
   Agency had begun supporting my work under a Los Alamos
   National Labs research grant in 1991, and had promised to
   extend their support for my work, but the funding was never
   forthcoming. I developed the tool, but after I completed
   the work, in early 1994, the bureaucrats in the agency
   reneged on funding.
   The idea of working with the NSA is controversial in the
   community of security professionals and civil libertarians,
   many of whom regard the NSA as a high-tech castle of
   darkness.
   Libertarian by inclination or by the influence of their
   colleagues, the nation's best computer hackers tend to
   possess a remarkable sensitivity to even the slightest hint
   of a civil liberties violation. They view with deep
   distrust the work of the National Security Agency, which
   has the twin missions of electronic spying around the globe
   and protecting the government's computer data. This
   distrust extends to anyone who works with the agency. Am I
   contaminated because I accepted research funding from the
   NSA? The situation reminds me of the scene in the movie Dr.
   Strangelove where General Jack D. Ripper is obsessed by the
   idea of his bodily fluids being contaminated. I think the
   idea of guilt by association is absurd.
   My view is very different. First of all, I don't believe in
   classified research and so I don't do it. The work I was
   undertaking on packet-filtering tools was supposed to be
   funded by the agency for public release. The tools were to
   be made widely available to everyone, to use against the
   bad guys who were already using similar tools to invade
   people's privacy and compromise the security of machines on
   the Internet.
   But even more to the point, I believe that the agency,
   rather than inherently evil, is essentially inept. Many
   people are frightened of the NSA, not realizing that it is
   like any other bureaucracy, with all of a bureaucracy's
   attendant failings. Because the NSA staff lives in a
   classified world, the government's normal system of checks
   and balances doesn't apply. But that doesn't mean that
   their technology outpaces the open computer world; it just
   means they're out of touch and ponderous.
   In any case, I feel strongly that tools like BPF are
   absolutely essential if the Internet is to have real
   security, and if we are to have the ability to trace
   vandals through the Net. If people are concerned that
   individual privacy is at stake, they should probably worry
   less about who should have the right to monitor the
   networks, and instead focus their efforts on making
   cryptographic software widely available. If information is
   encrypted it doesn't matter who sees it if they can't read
   the code. Cryptography is another example of my point that
   a tool is just a tool. It was, after all, used primarily by
   kings, generals, and spies until only two decades ago. Then
   work done by scientists at Stanford, MIT, and UCLA, coupled
   with the advent of the inexpensive personal computer, made
   encryption software available to anyone. As a result, the
   balance of power is dramatically shifting away from the NSA
   back toward the individual, and toward protecting our civil
   liberties.

Yes, indeed. James Bamford in "The Puzzle Palace" details the long-term TLA-access to international cable traffic -- via Operation Shamrock -- beginning in 1945 and ostensibly ending in 1975. See Chapter 6, "Targets."
Aside, in this chapter Bamford writes that Louis Tordella, who died earlier this week, "The Agency's chief keeper of the secrets," was central to targeting of thousands of Americans. Bamford says of Tordella, "If NSA was the darkest part of the government, Tordella was the darkest part of the NSA." Tordella allegedly shielded various NSA heads by not telling them what was going on -- to their great relief.
David Kahn in "The Codebreakers" more extensively examines the history of spying on citizens in the national interest. It will be interesting to read what he is currently researching at the more PR-oriented NSA -- and perhaps provide pointers to deep-blacker orgs that have supplanted it through non-FOIA arrangements like those of Shamrock.

   brain-wavers to reorganize the thirteen or so bloated,
   bumbling, cat-fighting intelligence agencies:
   1. Establish a new International Operations Agency to
      combine all operations units -- civilian and military --
      into one, separate from the CIA -- which he thinks has
      irretrievably lost operations credibility.
   2. CIA to do all intelligence analysis, but no collecting,
      to avoid contamination caused by "ownership of the
      data." The military to do intelligence collection and
      analysis only needed for immediate operations.
   3. FBI to do all counter-intelligence, domestic and
      international, with agents stationed overseas.
   4. Defense to do all imagery.
   5. NSA/NRO/???, though not named in open session,
      presumably would continue ELINT and SIGINT.
   6. All this will be very expensive, he roostered,
      intelligence on the cheap is worthless.
   7. The total intelligence budget to be made public but no
      further breakdown of how the the pot of gold is
      distributed to supplicants is to be confessed.
   Former Ambassador to China Tilley, a 25-year veteran of CIA
   operations, emphasized the importance of continuing Non
   Official Cover operations, which, he said, are invaluable
   very-long term penetrations. He cited those he set up in
   China as COS and then revisited fifteen years later as
   ambassador -- still ferreting deepest of demon red-commie
   secrets, he black-comicly glowered to the glazed-eyes. NOC,
   while very expensive, is crucial, he, too, parroted.
   For the full eye-opening pack of lies to replenish the pot    gold, Tilley co-conspired that a closed session was needed.
   But all the intel gold-digging experts testified to that,
   grinning malevolently, thus continuing the grand tradition
   of looting national treasuries top-secret cloaked by
   national interest.
   So, where are all those not-yet-reported CIA Non Official

Cypherpunks is featured in a story in The New Yorker of
   January 29 on the Mitnick/Shimomura books by Littman and

   The writer, Robert Wright, terms cpunks "an amorphous group
   that gets its name from its militant devotion to the
   widesrpead use of encryption." He refers to the comments
   here about Mitnick/Shimomura.
   More generally, Wright compares the two books, muses on
   career-boosting and Big Brother purposes of the media's
   melodramatic build-up of Mitnick and Shimomura, and
   outlines what might be done about Internet insecurity:
   1. Police -- by legislation for officials to monitor
      cyberspace.
   2. Privatize -- by IPs policing their own turf.
   3. Encrypt -- like cypherpunks.
   He comments on PRZ's case, notes possible infowar-type
   threats and closes:
      Given that federal officials who would constrain
      encryption seem to be swimming against the nearly
      inexorable tide of technological history, these are the
      [cyber-terrorism] kinds of scenarios they have to
      conjure up to justify their efforts. And these scenarios
      aren't entirely implausible. As cyberspace expands, we
      may see reasons to try to give the government the sort
      of power it seeks here. But those reasons won't look

The Washington Post initiates today a 6-part series on the
   loss of trust in all American institutions, "The Politics
   of Mistrust," based on a recent poll sponsored by the    Post, Harvard and the Kaiser Family Foundation.
   While not directly related to technical crypto, a number    of findings parallel discussions here about the diminution
   of personal and economic security. Samples:
      America is becoming a nation of suspicious strangers,
      and this mistrust of each other is a major reason
      Americans have lost confidence in the federal government
      and virtually every other major national institution.
      Every generation that has come of age since the 1950s
      has been more mistrusting of human nature, a
      transformation in the national outlook that has deeply
      corroded the nation's social and political life.
      Mistrustful Americans repeatedly expressed far less
      confidence in the federal government, the military, the
      Supreme Court, Congress and the Clinton administration
      than the dwindling numbers of Americans who were more
      upbeat about human nature.
      Fear of crime, economic insecurity and pessimism about
      the lives of future generations all have separately
      added to the belief that government is either making
      things worse or is incapable of making them better.
      Today, a clear majority of respondents in their early
      20s said they do not trust their fellow Americans, a view
      they share with one in four Americans over the age of
      60. "It's like living in the cave man age," said a 29-
      year-old. "Nobody cares anymore. Nobody cares. They will
      no sooner run you down and run away than to spit in your
      face."
      An environment in which a majority of Americans believe
      that most people can't be trusted breeds attitudes that
      hold all politicians as corrupt, venal and self-serving,
      and government action is doomed to failure.
      Wages have stagnated, workers change jobs frequently and
      downsizing corporations offer little protection even to
      the most loyal of employees.
      Americans who feel most pessimistic about the economy
      also are more likely to see the government as a threat.
   Harvard and Kaiser are to separately publish their own
   analysis of the poll.
   The first article offers much more detail and is quite
   long, about a page and a half. Perhaps someone might offer

Spy Agency Said to Have Spare Billions
     The National Reconnaissance Office, the secret agency
     that builds spy satellites, lost track of more than $2 billion in
     classified money last year, largely because of its own      secrecy, intelligence officials say.
     In the past, congressional oversight of the reconnaissance      has been sketchy, because few members of Congress
     understood the highly technical language of spy satellites and some
     did not know what they were approving when they authorized      of dollars a year in secret spending.

   "Chinese Firewall: Beijing Seeks to Build Version of the

      "We've eliminated what is undesirable and kept what is

      information age, from satellite television and real-time
      news to the Internet. Beijing eagerly seeks the fanciest
      information hardware, but it fears much of the software.
      China, in short, is determined to do what conventional

      while restricting access to information. The reason: If
      the Internet has proved its utility, it has also become
      a fluid medium for the two things China's authoritarian

   Try for Al Bayse, formerly assistant director of the FBI's
   Technical Services Division and its long-time senior
   techonology expert. Here's a quote from David Burnham's new
   book, "Above the Law:"
      Al Bayse, whom FBI documents suggest has been involved
      in the Clipper since its inception, was ecstatic about
      its inception. Shortly before the White House announced
      the project to reporters, he telephoned the three
      leading security experts in the academic world --
      Dorothy Denning of Georgetown University, Lance Hoffman
      of George Washington University and Peter Neumann of SRI
      International -- and informed them that the FBI's
      problem had been solved. (p. 150)
   Burnham claims that because Bayse shaped and directed the
   FBI's investigative technologies from the late 1970s to the
   mid-1990s he "may well be the nation's single most
   influential law enforcement official since J. Edgar
   Hoover." (p. 136)

@_subject: Toad Hall 
Chapter 2 TOAD HALL    In keeping with Internet nomenclature, Toad Hall acquired
   the Internet domain name toad.com, whose gateway to the
   rest of the world was a Sun SPARCstation computer in the
   building's basement. This digital domain was run by John
   and an eclectic band of programmers and hardware gurus, who
   together had a diverse political outlook, and while privacy
   was a priority, computer security at Toad was often pretty
   loose. ...
   For the past five years, Toad Hall had been Julia
   [Menapace]'s home -- for John Gilmore was the "other man,"
   with whom her relationship had been souring even before she
   and I had met. During the Christmas holidays John was away
   visiting his relatives in Florida, and so Julia and I had
   Toad Hall to ourselves when we arrived around 4 P.M. on the
   afternoon of her flight from Nepal.
   John, now forty, was someone I'd known from hacker circles,
   and even as a friend, for a number of years. ... Initially
   he hadn't minded that Julia and I spent time backpacking
   together while he worked long hours on his new start-up,
   because hiking didn't interest him. But once Julia and I
   had become more intimately involved, things grew chilly
   between him and me.
   Julia and I sent out for dinner from an Italian place
   called Bambino's. When it came, we undressed and sank into
   the indoor hot tub, eating while we soaked.
   The upstairs bathroom in Toad Hall is an unusual room. It
   is faced with a white and pink marble floor and wainscoting
   surrounding a dark green jacuzzi tub and other fixtures. A
   large asparagus fern sits on the window ledge, centered
   above the cascading waterfall of the tub's larger faucet.
   The fronds of the fern tumble down toward the water. Julia
   had, put on a cassette tape of Karma Moffet playing
   Himalayan intruments, and then lit candles; the only other
   light came from four overhead spotlights that dimly
   illuminated each corner of the tub.
   "This is just amazing," Julia murmured through the steamy
   air. She said she had fantasized continually about a long
   soak in hot water while trekking in the frigid Himalayas,
   where water is carried by hand from its source and becomes
   hot only when heated over flames, and where there is never
   enough to sit in. And at high altitude in the Solu Khumbu
   region of Nepal, the only heat had come from the sun, the
   small cooking fire, and the occasional woodstove fueled by
   wood scraps or dung.
   While we ate Julia told me stories of her adventures. In
   the kitchen of a lodge where she stayed she met and
   befriended a Sherpa guide named Tshering and a mountain
   guide from Seattle named Rachel DeSilva, who had led a
   group of 12 women to climb a 6,000-meter trekking peak in
   the region named Mara. Afterward they had invited her to
   climb another mountain named Lobuche, which lay to the
   north toward Everest. She had made it to just below the
   summit.
   I sat entranced. "I wish I had been there too," was all I
   could find to say.
   Julia had spent her birthday at the Tengboche monastery to
   celebrate the Mani Rimdu festival. She showed me a red
   string necklace that she had received when a Tibetan Lama
   had blessed her on her thirty-fifth birthday.
   "Near noon that same day, I heard the sound of long horns,
   cymbals, and drums," she recalled. "Then an avalanche
   poured in slow motion down the south face of Ama Dablam."
   Later in the trip she had stopped at one point to watch a
   sunset over Everest through the gathering mist, and she
   said it was so stark and beautiful that she cried. "I
   thought of you," she told me, "and wished you were there to
   share it with me."
   As we soaked, I told her about what had happened to me
   while she was gone. When Julia left I had been waiting for
   a $500,000 per year research grant from the National
   Security Agency, the nation's electronic intelligence-
   gathering organization. The NSA has two missions: one, its
   foreign spying mission and the other its responsibility for
   the security of all the governments computers and
   communications. In the fall an information security
   division in the agency had told me they would fund a
   project permitting me to assemble a team of experts to do
   research in new areas of computer security. I was ready to
   go and I had commitments from people to start work, but the
   agency had dragged its feet for months. Finally I had
   gotten tired of being jerked around, and two of my
   researchers had been forced to take other jobs.
   "I thought everything would be ironed out and I'd come back
   to find you happily at work with your team," she said.
   "No it wasn't," I answered. "They're amazingly inept, just
   like any government bureaucracy."
   We talked for a while about the NSA and how so many people
   in the civil liberties community fear them as Big Brother
   as well as anyone associated with them, arguing that they
   become corrupted by association. But that had never seemed
   accurate to me. Everything I'd seen indicated they were a
   largely incompetent organization tied up in endless
   regulations that could do little good or evil. And people
   are quite capable of making up their own minds.
   "I don't want to deal with them," I said.
   "I'm sorry it didn't work out, Tsutomu," she said quietly.
   We soaked for a while, both of us lost in thought. Finally
   I changed the subject.
   "I want to tell you something I've been thinking about," I
   said. "I've thought about a lot of things while you were
   away. I'd really like to try having a committed
   relationship with you, if you're willing to."
   Julia smiled. She didn't say anything, but she reached over
   and held me closely.
   It seemed like we would now be able to share a lot of time
   together. I told her I'd taken a leave of absence from the
   universlty and now I was looking forward to skiing and
   getting away. I was finally pursuing my long-held plan to
   spend a winter in the mountains, spending the mornings and
   late afternoons skiing and the mid-days and evenings
   thinking and working on my research projects.
   "Why don't you come with me and live in the mountains?" I
   suggested. "You can come ski and it will be good to be
   outside."
   We woke at about 1 P.M. the next day and Julia -- who grew
   up on the East Coast and is still learning to deal with
   mild California winters -- told me that she had seen the
   first morning light before she fell asleep and thought to
   herself, *It's Christmas and there is no sign of it here.*
   She was still jet-lagged and also feeling what she feared
   was flu coming on. We decided to spend the day inside,
   catching up on talk and sleep. It was chilly out, so Julia
   turned up Toad Hall's central heat, still eager to soak up
   the warmth of civilization after two months in the
   Himalaya.
   A bit later, while she rested, I was walking around the
   house, and several times went past the Sun SPARCstation in
   the hallway. It was a reminder that I probably had new
   electronic mail, but I didn't feel like checking it.
   At just about that moment, however, ominous bits of data
   were flowing through the Ethernet cable that wound through
   Toad's rooms and hallways. From somewhere, perhaps
   thousands of kilometers away, an electronic intruder had
   taken control of toad.com by remotely commandeering the
   SPARCstation in the basement. And while the two of us spent
   the day together two floors above, the electronic hijacker
   was using toad.com as a staging base to launch an attack on
   the computers in my own beach house some 800 kilometers
   south.

      A mathematician who helped break Enigma, and later       spent 16 years as the deputy director of the National       Security Agency. An intelligence visionary who had       helped create and shape NSA even before he became its

      as a pioneer in the development of ever more powerful
      and sophisticated computers to break enemy codes and as
      a master administrator who established a combined       code-breaking operation and then ran it.
      Since decryption devices did not exist, he and his
      colleagues simply designed and built them, not only
      breaking the enemy codes but helping to lay the
      theoretical and practical groundwork for what has become

The Washington Post, February 5, 1996, p. A8.
   Language on 'Indecency' Sparks Telecommunications Bill
   Protest
   By John Schwartz
   Provisions in the overhaul of the nation's
   telecommunications laws that call for regulating adult
   materials on the Internet have sparked a storm of anger and
   protest on that medium.
   "This is the kind of legislation you'd see from a lot of
   senators and congressmen who have never logged on," said
   Michael Godwin, staff counsel for the Electronic Frontier
   Foundation, a civil liberties group. "The Christian Right
   thinks they've hit a home run here, but the inning isn't
   over."
   The provisions, proposed by Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.),
   have gained momentum with support from religious
   conservative organizations. The legislation would make it
   illegal to make "indecent" material available to minors via
   computer, with penalties of two years in prison and up to
   $250,000 in fines. Exon called passage last week "a victory
   for children and families," adding, "We've come to a
   successful closing of the 'peep show' doors to our youth."
   President Clinton has said he will sign the bill.
   Those opposed to the regulations, however, said the
   "indecency" standard, which has been used in broadcast
   regulation cases, is too vague and would seriously restrict
   the potential of the emerging on-line medium.
   "I am concerned this legislation places restrictions on the
   Internet that will come back to haunt us," said Sen.
   Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.). He warned that quoting from such
   works as "Catcher in the Rye" and "Ulysses" in on-line
   discussions could court prosecution and said that making it
   illegal to "make available" indecent language would outlaw
   posting of messages or images that a child might see.
   "Imagine if the Whitney Museum ... were dragged into court
   for permitting representations of Michelangelo's David to
   be looked at by kids."
   But John McMickle, an aide to Sen. Charles E. Grassley
   (R-Iowa), said drafters rejected the idea that Userious
   works of redeeming value" would fall within the law, which
   he said would apply only to "patently offensive" material.
   McMickle said the bill "is not a Comstock-type effort to
   wipe out literature or political speech."
   The American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier
   Foundation and other organizations are preparing a lawsuit
   challenging the indecency provisions on constitutional
   grounds. Other legal actions are in the works. An on-line
   publication, American Reporter, has announced it will soon
   publish a column by a Texas judge denouncing the
   legislation intentionally salted with "indecent" language;
   Randall Boe, a Washington attorney for the American
   Reporter, said he would immediately sue after publication.
   "We want to move promptly to have this statute set aside as
   unconstitutional," Boe said. "The longer it's in place, the
   greater the harm done to the Internet and to the First
   Amendment." Boe's firm, Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin &
   Kahn, was defense council in the landmark "seven dirty
   words" case, which set the legal standard for indecent
   language in broadcasting based on a monologue by comedian
   George Carlin.
   Cathleen Cleaver, director of legal studies for the Family
   Research Council, said yesterday she expected such suits
   and that her conservative organization, which has pushed
   for on-line regulation, would fight to uphold it.
   The Justice Department has stated that the legislation
   would be vulnerable to attack on constitutional grounds.
   But in response to a letter from Grassley, Assistant
   Attorney General Andrew Fois noted last week that the
   department is defending the indecency standard in
   legislation "and will continue to defend similar statutes
   against constitutional challenges, so long as we can assert
   a reasonable defense consistent with the Supreme Court
   rulings in this area."

Wall Street Journal, February 8, 1996, p. A10.
   China, U.S. Firm Challenge U.S. On Encryption-Software
   Exports
   By Don Clark
   RSA Data Security Inc., the dominant supplier of
   data-privacy software, announced an unusual partnership
   with the Chinese government that exploits loopholes in U.S.
   export restrictions on codemaking technology.
   As part of the deal, RSA, which is based in Redwood City,
   Calif., plans to fund an effort by Chinese government
   scientists to develop new encryption software. The
   Chinese-developed software, based on RSA's general
   mathematical formula, may be more powerful than versions
   now permitted for export under U.S. Iaws, said James
   Bidzos, RSA's president.
   Two Chinese agencies also will use and distribute RSA data
   encryption products that may be legally exported from the
   U.S. The Chinese encryption-development arrangement, which
   isn't based on those products, appears to be legal as long
   as RSA doesn't supply the scientists with any other
   controlled technology, lawyers familiar with export laws
   said.
   RSA's move comes at a sensitive time in U.S.-China
   relations, and opens a new front in the company's
   long-running campaign against encryption export
   regulations. The closely held company, and other U.S.
   software concerns, have attacked the Clinton administration
   and the National Security Agency for trying to limit the
   strength of exported U.S. technology, while stronger
   products increasingly can be purchased from competing
   foreign companies.
   "The government has opened export doors a crack, and we
   sort of drove a Mack truck through them," Mr. Bidzos said
   of the Chinese deal. "The genie is truly out of the
   bottle."
   Stewart Baker, a Washington lawyer and former general
   counsel of the NSA, said the government "obviously would
   not be thrilled" by RSA's China venture. China hasn't in
   the past been party to international agreements governing
   encryption exports, he noted, and RSA's move could force
   other countries to consider China as an important player.
   "It's going to create an interesting strain in the
   international discussion," he said.
   Japan, an even more potent force in technology, appears to
   be leaning toward loosening export controls on encryption,
   Mr. Baker and other industry executives say. RSA plans to
   announce the formation of a new company in Japan today, but
   the venture will be subject to U.S. export controls, Mr.
   Bidzos said.
   Encryption uses special mathematical formulas, called
   algorithms, to scramble voice conversations or data to make
   them unintelligible to eavesdroppers. RSA's founders
   developed a popular variant of the technology that helps
   determine the authenticity of senders and recipients of
   messages. Both privacy and authentication are widely
   regarded as crucial to advances in electronic commerce.
   RSA struck its deal with departments of China's Ministry of
   Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and the Academy of
   Sciences. They will use two RSA software products -- one
   for authentication and one for protecting the contents of
   PC hard drives -- internally and help distribute them. The
   Academy scientists who will develop new encryption software
   also will be paid to try to break RSA's products to test
   their strength, Mr. Bidzos said.
   A spokesman at the Commerce Department's bureau of export
   administration said he was unaware of RSA's China venture,
   but said the agency would be monitoring developments.
   Mr. Baker, the former NSA attorney, questioned whether
   customers in other countries would warm to the idea of
   Chinese-developed encryption software. Products approved by
   the U.S. government for export have the stigma that NSA can
   decode, and Chinese products might be subject to even more
   suspicion, Mr. Baker said.
   Still, the RSA deal is likely to be seen as further
   evidence of slipping U.S. control over encryption. "It is
   another example of what happens when you try to impose
   unilateral controls on what is in reality uncontrollable
   technology," said Bruce Heiman, an outside attorney for the
   Business Software Alliance.

The New York Times, February 10, 1996
   The Idiot Chip
   By Frank Rich [Columnist]
   In the annals of dumb solutions to serious problems,
   history will have a ball with the V-chip, the antidote to
   trash TV that became the law of the land on Thursday when
   Bill Clinton signed the telecommunications bill. Far from
   making television safer for children, the V-chip will
   merely postpone and confuse the issue until well into the
   next century -- even as it provides politicians with
   convenient cover.
   By embracing the V-chip, Democrats and Republicans alike
   can posture as if they care about children without actually
   having to do anything to improve their cultural lot.
   Let Mr. V-chip do the job instead!
   The V-chip is a gimmick that has as much to do with
   ameliorating TV for kids as the Forbes flat tax has to do
   with serious tax reform.
   To see why, it's essential to realize that a cultural
   revolution took place in America this week.
   Contrary to the headlines and sound bites, the new
   telecommunications law is not just about cable rates and
   phone service, the explosion of new technologies and the
   unconstitutional effort to stamp out "indecency" and
   abortion information on the Internet.
   If you look at the bigger picture, this law is also about
   a mammoth expansion of mass culture -- more media, more
   outlets -- and a rapid expansion of power for the handful
   of mega-corporations that control it all, from TV, movies,
   music and publishing to both print and electronic news. It
   was perfectly symbolic that on the day Mr. Clinton signed
   the bill, Disney got its official Federal approval to
   swallow up ABC.
   Into this vast new universe of omnipotent media goliaths
   comes the tiny V-chip, designed to help parents block the
   coarse outpourings of an exploding digital universe.
   Common sense alone dooms this gizmo to failure.
   Who can rate some 600,000 hours of programming broadcast
   per year by even our current 70-channel cable systems?
   (Hollywood only has to rate roughly 550 movies -- 1,000
   hours -- per year.) Should crime-sated local news be
   blocked? "MASH" reruns? Reports from a future gulf war?
   "E.R."? Pro football? "Schindler's List"? (If so, a network
   may be tempted to duck a V-chip block -- which would lower
   ratings and revenue -- by sanitizing the Holocaust.)
   Even if all the practical, political and legal questions
   raised by the V-chip could be miraculously resolved
   overnight, it is still pie-in-the-sky. The chips are only
   required on new TV sets, so it will be years before most
   households, especially multi-set households, will be in the
   V-chip's harness.
   Even then, parents with kids in different age groups will
   have to choose between their younger and older children as
   they decide whether to flick the switch each night. Weaker
   parents will take the same path of least resistance they do
   now.
   As the founder of Action for Children's Television, Peggy
   Charren has been fighting for kids decades longer than most
   politicians.
   She is not only skeptical that the V-chip will transform
   lax parents into concerned ones, but points out that the
   chip doesn't even address the Saturday morning blight of
   brainwashing commercials ("worse than the programming") for
   violent toys and junk food.
   Nor, Ms. Charren adds, is there any language in the
   telecommunications law to require networks to increase the
   quantity and quality of good children's TV that might offer
   an after-school alternative to "Jenny Jones."
   Mr. Clinton will press for better programming when he meets
   with Hollywood potentates -- some of whom are his campaign
   contributors -- at the White House on Feb. 29. A far
   tougher idea -- one adopted by the British Government last
   month -- is being promoted by the Media Access Project, a
   public-interest organization.
   It argues that the one gift the networks still want from
   Congress and didn't get in the telecommunications law --
   more space on the public airwaves (so-called "spectrum")
   for additional channels -- be given only if they agree to
   cede some of it to public-service broadcasting, including
   top-notch children's TV.
   But the greedy media goliaths will fight any such proposal
   as vehemently as they oppose the V-chip.
   The politicians, hiding behind the V-chip, will let them
   get away with it.
   Delinquent parents, told that their children will soon be
   in the hands of an electronic nanny, will have a new excuse
   for doing nothing.
   And like each TV generation before it, today's children
   will grow up to fight this battle for their children on yet
   another day.

   Internet Users Say They'd Rather Not Share Their 'Cookies'
   By Joan E. Rigdon
   Netscape Communications Corp., responding to complaints
   from consumers, said it will change its Internet browser
   software so customers can prevent on-line merchants from
   tracking their footsteps in cyberspace.
   The ruckus began Monday, when the Financial Times reported
   on a little-known feature in Netscape software called
   Cookies. Cookies helps merchants on the Internet's
   multimedia World Wide Web track what customers do in their
   stores, and how long they spend doing it.
   Cookies stores this data on the customer's own hard drive,
   (in a text file called "Cookies.txt" in the Netscape
   directory) . The next time the customer visits the
   merchant's store, the merchant can read about the
   customer's last visit, and serve up a version of the store
   that's tailored for the customer.
   Cookies won't show merchants what other stores the customer
   has visited.
   Net surfers have complained on-line about the feature,
   saying it's an invasion of privacy and that it ties up the
   resources of their own computers.
   Netscape, the Mountain View, Calif., maker of the No. 1
   Internet browsing software, says it didn't think people
   might object to Cookies, since merchants can track a
   customer's footsteps even without Cookies, and few have
   complained about that. Product manager Jeff Treuhaft
   contends Cookies actually helps customers, because among
   other things, it allows customers to buy several things
   from different parts, or "pages," of an Internet store, and
   only pay once, instead of once at every page.
   Also, the Internet's standards board, called the Internet
   Engineering Task Force, has asked Netscape to propose
   Cookies as a standard for the Internet, Netscape said.
   Still, Netscape agreed to change the software. In future
   versions of Netscape, customers will have the choice of
   refusing to let a merchant lay down "a persistent Cookie,"
   Mr. Treuhaft says, referring to Cookies that track customer

You shoot electro-ammunition straight, so your credibility is solid. HQ should take target practice from you. Although explanations on this list may not be comprehensible to the public, or to NSCP's PR Dept.
What are the chances that NSCP might add a feature that would allow customers to say yes or no at login to tracking their movements at any site visited, with a friendly notice that tracking analysis was being done?
That might redeem the exchange value of cookies, and perhaps come closer to gving customers equality with the merchants, and merchants credibility with customers. As you are giving Netscape here, despite Wall Street's treachery.

   China Tells Internet Users To Register With Police
   Beijing (AP) - China ordered all users of the Internet and
   other international computer networks to register with the
   police, as part of an effort to tighten control over
   information.
   The order came in a circular issued by the Ministry of
   Public Security, according to the state-run Xinhua News
   Agency.
   Xinhua didn't give a date by which current users must
   register but said new users and those switching or
   terminating services must inform police within 30 days. It
   was unclear how foreigners would be affected.
   The rules haven't been published in detail, but previous
   Xinhua reports warned network users not to harm national
   security, reveal state secrets or disseminate pornography.
   China embarked on a broad crackdown on Internet users and
   other sources of information potentially harmful to
   government interests in December.
   The Ministry of Post Telecommunications was made the sole
   provider of channels connecting Chinese computer users with
   international networks.

   Cyberlaws [Editorial]
   Communication *sans frontieres*. To the Internet's fans
   that is the essence of its appeal. But to anyone putting
   information on the Internet's World Wide Web, its global
   nature is the cause of a growing headache: how to uphold
   intellectual property rights to the rivers of information
   pouring over its wires.
   Online computer systems such as the Net are among the
   fastest growing ways to distribute information -- music and
   pictures as well as words and numbers. But existing
   copyright laws deal inadequately with digital transmission.
   Regulation is complicated by the way that information
   downloaded in one country can have originated almost
   anywhere in the world. The $35bn-a-year music industry now
   believes that digital copyright abuse is a big future
   threat to its revenues.
   The century-old Berne convention on copyright and the
   General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade represent a degree
   of international agreement on the treatment of such issues.
   However, many countries are not signatories, while
   standards of intellectual property protection vary widely
   among those which have signed.
   Moreover, there are technological problems in enforcing
   agreements even where they exist. At present, it is often
   difficult to identify both those who have accessed
   information, and those who have entered it on the Net.
   Given that problem, some groups want companies providing
   Internet access to be responsible for upholding rules,
   rather than users or publishers. But this is highly
   unattractive: service providers will be unaware of much on
   the Net.
   The currently imperfect state of protection is one reason
   why much cyberinformation is junk, of value to almost
   nobody, deposited partly to stir up interest in paidfor
   services beyond the Net. However, new ways to restrict
   access to parts of the Net, and to charge for subscriptions
   to that information, may address that shortcoming.
   Companies are also working on "electronic tags" which will
   show whether information is passed to unauthorised users.
   If such technological developments bear fruit, the whole
   game may change. The mainstay of the Internet may no longer
   be information already published in another medium.
   Instead, publishers could put material of real value on the
   Net, knowing they would be paid. Other media may be
   squeezed as the Internet assumes some of their role.
   In this respect, copyright problems are a symptom of the
   Internet's immaturity, rather than a sign that electronic
   sophistication has made regulation impossible. The Net
   itself is a creation of technology, not policy, and the
   solutions to this problem are more likely to be
   technological than legal. But solutions must be found if
   the Net is to realise its enormous commercial potential.

@_subject: Remailers Pose Risk 
Computerworld, February 12, 1996, Front page:
   Stealth E-mail poses corporate security risk
   By Gary H. Anthes
   Anonymous remailers on the Internet are emerging as a
   threat to national and corporate security, some experts
   warn.
   These remailers are Internet sites that strip the names and
   addresses from electronic-mail messages before passing them
   along anonymously to prople or newsgroups.
   For corporate information systems managers, stealth E-mail
   is especially troubling because it allows hackers to attack
   systems, steal trade secrets and broadcast them worldwide
   without leaving an audit trail for authorities to follow.
   "Anonymous remailers have a lot of nasty potential," said
   Stephen T. Kent, chief scientist for security technology at
   BBN Corp. in Cambridge, Mass. "They have the broadcast
   potential of the news media but without the possibility of
   recourse if something is unsubstantiated or defaming is
   published."
   Critics are calling for strict limits or an outright ban on
   remailer sites, but others insist they are a safeguard
   against electronic snooping by abusive governments and
   should be considered a political freedom.
   Anonymous remailers have been used in a variety of criminal
   acts, including distributing pornography and computer
   viruses, violating copyright laws and harassing people with
   nasty messages.
   One snowy day last month, for example, about 25% of the
   workforce at a defense contractor in Rockville, Md., went
   home after they received a bogus E-mail message dismissing
   them for the day. The message originated from an anonymous
   remailer that allowed the user to impersonate a senior
   company official.
   But there are more scary, less publicized uses of
   remailers, said Paul Strassmann, former director of defense
   information at the Pentagon. Stealth E-mail also is used
   extensively by Russian criminals, often former KGB agents.
   "This method of communication is a favorite for engaging
   the services of cyber-criminals and for authorizing payment
   for their acts through a third party." Strassmann said.
   Its Reputation Precedes It
   Perhaps the best-known remailer site is in Finland at
   anon.penet.fi.
   The Finnish server was used last year to publish
   confidential and copyrighted scriptures from the Church of
   Scientology. It also was used to reveal the secret source
   code used by RSA Data Security, Inc. in some of its
   encryption products.
   Last year, police raided the Finnish site and seized
   records and computer gear as part of an investigation of
   alleged copyright infringement.
   The administrator of anon.penet.fi offers this warning to
   new users: "I believe very firmly that it's not for me to
   dictate how other people ought to behave. But remember,
   anonymous postings are a privilege, and use them
   accordingly. Remember, this is a service that some people    who use newsgroups such as alt.sexual.abuse.recovery need.
   Please don't do anything stupid that would force me to
   close down the service."
   One remailer advertises itself as a way to thwart attempts
   by intelligence agencies to trace illegal traffic,
   Strassmann said. It holds all incoming messages until five
   minutes after the hour, then remails them in random order.
   The messages are sent through five to 20 other remailers,
   with a stop in at least one of the several countries noted
   for lax law enforcement, he said.
   Yet other experts say the threat from remailers is greatly
   exaggerated. "We've had remailers around for a while, and
   society hasn't fallen," said Mike Godwin, staff counsel at
   the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco. "We've
   had anonymous communication in the U.S. for years, you can
   use a public telephone, send a letter without a return
   address or engage in a cash transaction."
   Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down an Ohio law
   that required the authors of political posters and
   pamphlets to identify themselves. "In the case of political
   speach, you can't make people tell you who they are," said
   Patrick Sullivan, executive director of the Computer Ethics
   Institute in Washington.
   But Sullivan said the police raid on the Finnish remailer
   was prompted by the Church of Scientology's legitimate
   complaint about violations of copyright law.
   "I haven't heard many uses of remailers that haven't
   involved, at the very least, being disrespective and, at
   the most, trying to cause harm of some sort." he said.
   _________________________________________________________
   Battle against remailers an unfair fight
   Think of anonymous remailers as enemies you can't fight
   face to face, says Paul Strassmann, former director of
   defense information at the Pentagon and now a lecturer at
   the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.
   "Anonymous remailers are here to stay," he said. "That
   means the old military paradigm of retaliation falls apart.
   The whole theory of warfare has been if someone attacks
   you, you can attack them. But when you are anonymous, there
   is no one to shoot at."
   Strassmann said society myst look for defenses in the
   health sciences, not among electronic technologies.
   "The history of public health teaches us that suppression
   of any disease must be preceded by a thorough understanding
   of its behavior, its method of transmission and how it
   creates its own ecology," he said.
   "As in the case of smallpox, yellow fever, flu epidemics,
   AIDS or malaria, it will take disasters before the public
   may accept that some forms of restrictions on the
   electronic freedom of speech and  that  privacy may be
   worthwhile."

IBM has an ad in the Feb 26 New Yorker where a joker e-
   mails a recipe-swapping friend in Osaka that "I'll teleport
   you some goulash." The text then states:
      Margit is a little premature, but we are working on it.
      An IBM scientist and his colleagues have discovered a
      way to make an object disintegrate in one place and
      reappear intact in another.
      It sounds like magic. But their breakthrough could
      affect everything from the future of computers to our
      knowledge of the cosmos.
   What is this breakthrough or is it just a chump tease?

   Thanks much for your precis and the IBM pointer.    IBM's ad seems inspired by Clarke's "Any sufficiently
   advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
   The teleportation site hiply introduces the topic with    its science fiction ancestry.  The site even has a link to
   the "goulash" featured in the ad, so the tease is PR for
   IBM's magical research explorations.
   It was illuminating to read the tie of teleportation to
   quantum research -- cryptograpy, communication and who
   knows what else burbling in that wizard Watson lab.
   Because my Lynx could not get into IBM's "quantum
   cryptography," perhaps Blue is onto some Lotus-like    Q-Crypto soon to be teased in ads for cosmos-wide Net
   security or surveillance-proof chips and goulash.

@_subject: TIS--Building in Big Brother for a Better Tommorrow 
To supplement TIS's Web site information on CKE, here's a
   mailing from Steve Walker earlier this month:
   TRUSTED INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INC.
   February 2, 1996
   There has been amazing progress on TIS's Commercial Key
   Escrow (CKE) initiative since my last status report.
   In November, we submitted a Commodity Jurisdiction (CJ)
   request to the U.S. Department of State for our Gauntlet
   Internet Firewall Product with CKE-based IP Encryption,
   which constitutes our Global Virtual Private Network (GVPN)
   system (see figure 1). Our Gauntlet system has had a
   Virtual Private Network (VPN) capability using the Data
   Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm to encrypt
   firewall-to-firewall communications for the past year. But
   because of U.S. export controls, we have not been able to
   sell this option outside of the U.S. and Canada. By adding
   CKE technology to our firewalls, the Gauntlet system with
   DES and CKE now meets the U.S. government requirements for
   export to most parts of the world.
   In the course of several meetings with U.S. government
   representatives. we were told that it will take a while
   longer for all the details of the CJ process to be worked
   out, but that the U.S. government was willing to consider
   a temporary (up to 4-year) export license until the CJ
   process is in place. In early December, we submitted such
   a request and on January 19, 1996, it was approved (see
   figure 2).
   While this temporary export license has limitations (there
   must be a Data Recovey Center in the U.S. as well as in the
   foreign country because reciprocal agreements do not yet
   exist between the U.S. and foreign governments), it
   represents the first export approval of a DES-based key
   escrow encryption system, a small step but a giant leap
   toward full exportability of good cryptography when
   equipped with user-controlled key recovery. We are now
   discussing Global Virtual Private Networks, based on our
   Gauntlet-CKE system, with several multinational companies.
   In December, I attended a special meeting of the
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
   (OECD) in Paris to discuss the international ramifications
   of the U.S. key escrow initiative. The consensus of the
   meeting was that user-controlled key escrow provides the
   only workable solution to the long-standing dilemma between
   the private sector's need for encryption protection and
   governments' needs to be able to decrypt the communications
   of criminals, terrorists, and other adversaries. Other
   meetings will follow, but it appears that most major
   governments endorse the U.S. government's user-controlled
   key escrow initiative as the only practical way through the
   cryptography maze.
   In mid-January, Microsoft announced its long-awaited
   Cryptographic Application Programming Interface (CAPI).
   This development promises to finally provide a well-defined
   separation between applications calling on cryptography and
   the actual performance of the cryptography. Now users will
   be able to request cryptographic functions in hundreds of
   applications and select precisely which cryptography to use
   at the time of program execution rather than program
   purchase. Cryptographic Service Providers (CSPs) can now
   evolve independent of applications, and users can choose
   whatever cryptography is available wherever they are in the
   world. TIS is working closely with CSP vendors to ensure
   that CSPs with good cryptography are available in domestic
   and exportable versions as soon as possible based on the
   U.S. government's key escrow initiative.
   In a presentation at the recent RSA Conference, I tried to
   put all this in perspective by conducting a "thought
   experiment" (see attachment 3).
   +  Suppose the U.S. government had never thought of placing
      export controls on cryptography...
      We would now have widespread use of encryption, both
      domestically and worldwide; we would be in a state of
      "Utopia," with widespread availability of cryptography
      with unlimited key lengths. But, once in this state, we
      will face situations where we need a file that had been
      encrypted by an associate who is unavailable (illness,
      traffic jam, or change of jobs). We will then realize
      that we must have some systematic way to recover our
      encrypted information when the keys are unavailable.
      When we add a user-controlled key recovery capability to
      our Utopia, we find ourselves in an "Ultimate Utopia,"
      with unlimited key length cryptography, widely available
      through mass market applications, and user-controlled
      key recovery.
   +  But, unfortunately, the U.S. government *did* think of
      cryptographic export controls. And over the past several
      years, we have been frustrated by repeated unsuccessful
      attempts to resolve this dilemma...
      In 1992, the U.S. government allowed the export of
      40-bit keys, a solution so weak no one wanted it.
      In 1993, the U.S. government announced Clipper, an
      attempt to give users good cryptography while preserving
      the U.S. government's prerogatives. But almost everyone
      hated U.S. Government-controlled key escrow, including
      most foreign governments.
      In 1994, industry rebelled with the proposed Cantwell
      legislative initiative to remove cryptography from U.S.
      State Department control. And, behind the scenes, the
      U.S. government orchestrated a massive counterattack.
      The result: a study that acknowledged the widespread
      availability of foreign cryptography yet proposed no
      change in U.S. government policies on cryptographic
      exports.
   +  Then in 1995, the U.S. government announced its key
      escrow initiative: allow the export of up to 64-bit
      cryptography (a remarkable concession) when accompanied
      by an acceptable form of user-controlled key escrow
      (critical component to this policy being that "an
      acceptable escrow system" must have sufficient integrity
      to give the government confidence that, with a warrant,
      the keys will be available.)...
      Some in the computer industry labeled this just another
      form of Clipper and vowed to continue the fight against
      U.S. government regulation of encryption in any form --       presumably forever. On the other hand, once the new
      escrowed encryption policy was announced, U.S.
      government agencies -- the FBI, NSA, White House, DoD,
      DoJ, NIST, and NSC -- closed ranks behind it and have
      shown little interest in discussing any other
      approaches. In addition, neither political party has
      shown any interest in taking up the argument in the
      Congress, probably because it is a complex issue and
      there is no obvious "winning" position. But, depending
      upon how the definition of user-controlled key escrow is
      resolved, the new escrow policy could just be the
      long-sought compromise between government and industry
      that gets us through this morass.
   +  If we can ensure that organizations can control the
      security of backup access to their encrypted information
      through well-designed commercial key recovery systems --
      yet also ensure that governments have access when
      justified via normal legal procedures -- we may have
      truly found the "Ultimate Utopia" solution to a dilemma
      that has existed all of our professional lives and
      threatens to continue through the next generation...
   Thus, in my thought experiment I have come to the
   conclusion that we (industry and government) are all
   heading towards the same objective, but on a different path
   from what some of us originally wanted. Yet, to my way of
   thinking, that path has to accomodate us all if we are ever
   to arrive at any mutually agreeable destination. When one
   group of participants raises insurmountable barriers for
   another group, it simply blocks everyone from progressing
   down any path, and the net result is that U.S. industry is
   not able to export any good crypto-based security.
   We at TIS are dedicated to finding a solution acceptable to
   all sides. We ask your help in this struggle. If you want
   exportable cryptography routinely available in your
   lifetime and believe that user-controlled key recovery is
   an important, if not vital, capability, please contact us

   into your product line, we are ready to help. If you want
   to buy internationally deployable good cryptography with
   your favorite applications, tell your application vendor
   you want escrow-enabled applications.
   We all have an opportunity to make a major difference here.
   The opportunity is ours to take or forgo. Help us make this
   happen. Visit our www site, at  and

   Netscape Will Issue Fix for Flaw Found In Browser System
   Mountain View, Calif. - Netscape Communications Corp.
   confirmed that Princeton University researchers found a
   potential security flaw in Netscape's popular Internet
   browser technology, but said the flaw was minor and that
   the company will issue a software fix for it next week.
   Edward Felten, an assistant professor of computer science
   at Princeton, posted a report on the Internet earlier this
   week describing the flaw in Netscape's Navigator 2.0, a
   product that enables the use of programs created with Java,
   Sun Microsystems Inc.'s hot programming language for the
   Internet. Java can be used to create "applets," small
   applications such as spreadsheets, that can be downloaded
   from the Internet's World Wide Web.
   Both Netscape's Navigator and Sun's Java have defenses
   designed to prevent Java applets from connecting with any
   computers except the ones they are summoned to by users and
   the ones they came from. But the Princeton team found a way
   to defeat those defenses, meaning that applets could
   theoretically be manuevered into other computers on a
   network. Applets aren't viruses, but in theory, they could
   be used to peruse confidential documents or other
   information.
   In trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Netscape fell $1.875
   to $62, while Sun Microsystems jumped 7.8% to $51.875, up
   $3.75.
   Netscape product manager Jeff Treuhaft said exploiting the
   flaw would require extremely skilled hacking and many other
   unlikely advantages, such as intimate familiarity with the
   network being hacked.
   Marianne Mueller, a top Java security engineer, also said
   the chances of such hacking occurring are "remote," but
   said Sun also soon will issue a software fix that will plug
   the possible security leak.

   The detailed story correlates Hall's role with the well-

   The Washington Post, February 25, 1996, pp. H1, H4.
   Scrambling for a Policy on Encryption Exports
   [Long snip]
   Industry also is fanning Congress's interest in taking a
   bigger role in the encryption debate. "Without
   congressional interest, the administration has no reason to
   liberalize exports at all," said Becca Gould, director of
   policy at the Business Software Alliance. "This issue is in
   Congress's front yard because it affects the economy" as
   well as U.S. citizens' privacy rights.
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. Robert W. Goodlatte
   (R-Va.) agree. They plan to introduce bills in the Senate
   and House aimed at loosening the restrictions on
   encryption. "The federal government is taking an attitude
   that's based more in the 1970s than in present time," said
   Leahy in a telephone interview.
   "This is a matter that should be decided by legislation,"
   he added. "We're talking about billions of dollars in
   revenues and thousands of jobs if we're handicapped in our
   global market, especiaUy if what we're told to do is to
   build an export encryption program that is so outdated that
   our 12-year-old computer experts wouJd laugh at it."
   The bills would do away with export licenses for any
   encryption technology considered to be "generally
   available," or "in the public domain." Leahy said that
   although he, too, worries about national security and
   terrorism, trying to bottle up technology won't solve the
   problem.
   Law enforcement has "got to figure out how to keep ahead
   ... and surprise, surprise, there will be some times when
   we won't be able to eavesdrop," Leahy said. Even now,
   criminals can make calls at pay telephones or avoid
   detection in other ways. The government shouldn't cripple
   the computer industry every time a new technology springs
   up that challenges law enforcement, he said.
   "What I'm suggesting is that if [the administration] works
   with the Congress, we'll find a solution," Leahy said.

   Scrambling for a Policy on Encryption Exports
      As Technology Advances, U.S. and Industry Seek
      Compromise That Balances Public, Private Fears
   By Elizabeth Corcoran
   Keeping information about technology out of other people's
   hands gets tougher all the time. And in the realm of the
   Internet, where information ignores boundaries and some
   cybersurfers flaunt rules, it may become impossible.
   A big test of that statement is emerging in cryptography,
   the business of scrambling information so that it looks
   like gibberish to anyone lacking the keys for unlocking the
   code.
   Once considered an arcane subspecialty of mathematicians
   and espionage, cryptography is rapidly becoming big
   business as more and more of the world's information is
   exchanged on electronic networks and as more and more
   people want to protect their data from prying eyes.
   But in these times of international terrorism, drug
   trafficking and sometimes peculiar financial transactions,
   law enforcement agencies want to be able to legally
   eavesdrop. As technology has grown dramatically more
   powerful, the ability to peek at encrypted information is
   slipping from the hands of government.
   That balance -- how much access can government demand vs.
   how much privacy others want -- has long been a theological
   debate between civil liberties advocates and worried law
   enforcement officials.
   Now, giddy with the growth of the Internet, technology
   companies have joined the debate. Both the software
   industry and civil liberties advocates believe powerful
   encryption will spur the growth of electronic
   communications and the Internet. And they don't want
   encryption restrictions to curb that growth.
   There are no limits on what kinds of encryption people can
   use within the United States. But the government has used
   export restrictions to try to shape what encryption
   technology is used internationally, and by extension, what
   is available in the United States. Those export laws
   prohibit U.S. companies from selling their best technology
   overseas.
   The restrictions, companies contend slow the development of
   the Internet and harm a potentially lucrative market for
   U.S. manufacturing. Making two flavors of an encryption
   product, U.S. companies contend, is expensive. Yet even
   more worrisome is that foreign competitors are likely to
   move in and offer better technology. That could spell the
   loss not just of sales of encryption technology, but of
   many other products that rely on strong digital protection
   as well.
   So companies are looking hard for ways to wriggle around
   the rules -- and beginning to find them.
   "Trying to suppress this technobgy is like Prohibition,"
   said Whitfield Diffie, a cryptographer at Sun Microsystems
   Inc. and an outspoken advocate of widespread use of
   encryption technology. Companies will use anything at hand
   -- technology, business strategies and even the promise of
   congressional action -- to begin to get their home-brews
   out.
   Building and breaking encryption is hard. All information
   stored in computers -- whether pictures or sounds or
   documents -- is represented by ones or zeros or bits, the
   genetic code of the digital world. Encryption techniques
   amount to applying clever mathematical formulas to a
   collection of bits to make it look like gibberish to the
   uninitiated.
   Unlocking encrypted data requires a "key," a mathematical
   formula that can make sense of the tricks used to scramble
   the data. One common way to measure the sophisticaticn of
   an encryption scheme is by the number of bits in the key.
   The more bits, the harder it is to decode the information.
   A 30-bit key, for instance, could take as many as a billion
   random calculations to crack the code. A 60-bit key could
   take a billion-times-a-billion calculations.
   In past decades, governments were largely the only
   organizations with the money and need to tackle such
   expensive problems. But as the power of computers has
   soared -- and the cost of running millions of calculations
   has fallen -- companies and individuals have begun to
   clamor for sophisticated encryption.
   "We believe that encryption is a critical technology" to
   support many areas of electronic commerce, said Craig
   Mundie, a senior vice president at Microsoft Corp.
   Under current rules, U.S. companies can export encryption
   technologies that use up to 40-bit keys. A few years ago,
   such a lock might have stopped all but the most determined
   digital interlopers.
   No more. Within the past year graduate students at the
   Ecole Polytechnique in Paris and others at the
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology have shown they can
   break the 40-bit encryption used by Netscape Communications
   Corp. A few weeks ago, Diffie and six other well-know
   cryptographers began circulating a report in which they
   argue that to "adequately" protect information for the next
   20 years, keys should be as long as 90 bits.
   Even encryption wizards at the National Security Agency
   would have trouble unlocking 90-bit encrypted information,
   experts say.
   So the government has tried to craft a compromise. Last
   summer, the government suggested that it would likely let
   companies use up to 64-bit encryption -- provided they set
   up a way for law enforcement agents, with a court order, to
   unlock encrypted information.
   Under this proposal, a "trusted third party," such as a
   bank or an encryption company that typically handles
   sensitive information, would safeguard the key. The plan
   has since bogged down over such details as precisely who
   might qualify as a trusted third party.
   Last fall, Trusted Information Systems (TIS) in Glenwood,
   Md., in what it calls a test case, applied for a license to
   export a sophisticated (and still unexportable) 56-bit
   encryption system called DES. Steve Walker, who heads TIS,
   has invested months in outlining the sort of spare-key
   program that he believes both the government and his
   customers can stomach. In late January, he got approval to
   ship his product to Britain.
   "It's not perfect; it's not where we want to be," Walker
   insisted. He purposely submitted a case, he said, that was
   virtually certain to meet the government's still evolving
   criteria. "But it's a first, giant baby step," he said.
   Trusting a Third Party?
   Others are uneasy with putting the means to unlock files in
   the hands of a "trusted third party."
   "Ask anyone who owns a business: Are they willing to give
   copies of a spare key that leads to everything sensitive in
   their company to a third party," said Jim Bidzos, chief
   executive of RSA Data Security Inc., a leading encryption
   firm.
   But government officials get nervous if the only keys to
   the scrambled material are held by its owners. Ed Roback,
   an encryption policy specialist at the National Institute
   of Standards and Technology, puts it this way: "I know of
   few front doors that can't be broken down. It's a little
   different with encryption," when it literally might take
   10,000 years to break the code without the key.
   Roback and law enforcement officials say they'd be
   delighted to see Americans make more use of encryption,
   particularly if spare keys were held by a third party.
   "This nation, more than any other, relies on computers ...
   [so] there's a lot of vulnerability and encryption can help
   that," Roback said. "So it's a good thing -- but it can
   present a problem for national law enforcement."
   But momentum in the United States could swing toward
   widespread use of sophisticated encryption -- without spare
   keys -- if such technology was widely available. That's
   just what a recent announcement from Microsoft could help
   spur.
   In January, Microsoft told developers it had created a
   module in its operating system software that will let
   applications such as word processing programs or
   spreadsheets "plug in" to encryption technology.
   An application developer who built a software program for
   filing expense accounts would not have to add encryption to
   his product. Instead, the developer would need only to
   write a small program that taps the encryption technology
   available through the operating system.
   The strength of the encryption program could vary.
   Microsoft plans to include a 40-bit code with the version
   of Windows used principaUy by companies (called Windows
   NT). That encryption technology would be easy to export.
   But Microsoft also is encouraging other encryption firms,
   including RSA and TSI, to build more sophisticated
   encryption modules that could be used in the United States.
   Commercial products that take advantage of the new function
   are not likely to appear until the end of the year. But
   Microsoft is hoping it will spur more widespread use of
   encryption. "The single most pressing problem for
   electronic commerce is to create a secure payment
   structure," Mundie said -- and Microsoft is hoping to
   accelerate that work.
   RSA's Bidzos is among those in industry who would love to
   see the government give up on trying to control encryption
   technology. He worries that other countries are gearing up
   to snatch a big role in selling encryption while his
   company and other U.S. businesses remain entangled in U.S.
   policies.
   So he's testing the rules. Early this month, RSA announced
   that it had created subsidiaries in the People's Republic
   of China and in Japan. In China, RSA partners include the
   Chinese government. Bidzos plans to do joint research on
   encryption software with scientists there.
   Although Bidzos says he is planning to export only the
   approved, 40-bit encryption technology to his Chinese
   colleagues, "one genuine concern is that they might try to
   strengthen it themselves," he said. "It would be hard to do
   -- but not impossible. I've never had a conversation with
   [the Chinese] about it," Bidzos added.
   In addition, the Chinese have some interesting ideas of
   their own about new areas of cryptography, Bidzos said.
   "They're pretty advanced." And if the group developed more
   powerful techniques than even RSA has in the United States?
   Bidzos shrugged. RSA would likely take any promising ideas
   and develop them into products in the United States. As for
   Chinese export restrictions, "I haven't thought about it,"
   he said.
   Going Up to the Hill
   Industry also is fanning Congress's interest in taking a
   bigger role in the encryption debate. "Without
   congressional interest, the administration has no reason to
   liberalize exports at all," said Becca Gould, director of
   policy at the Business Software Alliance. "This issue is in
   Congress's front yard because it affects the economy" as
   well as U.S. citizens' privacy rights.
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. Robert W. Goodlatte
   (R-Va.) agree. They plan to introduce bills in the Senate
   and House aimed at loosening the restrictions on
   encryption. "The federal government is taking an attitude
   that's based more in the 1970s than in present time," said
   Leahy in a telephone interview.
   "This is a matter that should be decided by legislation,"
   he added. "We're talking about billions of dollars in
   revenues and thousands of jobs if we're handicapped in our
   global market, especially if what we're told to do is to
   build an export encryption program that is so outdated that
   our 12-year-old computer experts would laugh at it."
   The bills would do away with export licenses for any
   encryption technology considered to be "generally
   available," or "in the public domain." Leahy said that
   although he, too, worries about national security and
   terrorism, trying to bottle up technology won't solve the
   problem.
   Law enforcement has "got to figure out how to keep ahead
   ... and surprise, surprise, there will be some times when
   we won't be able to eavesdrop," Leahy said. Even now,
   criminals can make calls at pay telephones or avoid
   detection in other ways. The government shouldn't cripple
   the computer industry every time a new technology springs
   up that challenges law enforcement, he said.
   "What I'm suggesting is that if [the administration] works
   with the Congress, we'll find a solution," Leahy said.
   "We say over and over that we recognize that this is a very
   difficult issue," Roback said. But, he added, "the
   government has thought about [encryption policies] for a
   long time as well as industry," he said. To reach some
   resolution, he added, "compromise is going to be necessary
   on all fronts."

   New Proposals On Encryption Get Tepid Response
   By Jared Sandberg
   Two bills are expected to be introduced in Congress that
   try to resolve the deadlock between the administration and
   the Internet industry on software encryption, but industry
   executives are lukewarm to the new proposals.
   The two proposals, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Patrick J.
   Leahy of Vermont and GOP Rep. Robert W. Goodlatte of
   Virginia, seek to loosen government restrictions on
   encryption -- mathematical formulas that are used to
   scramble data beyond recognition of eavesdroppers. The
   government prevents the export of strong encryption because
   it hampers its efforts to monitor the actions of terrorists
   and foreign governments. The Clinton administration wants
   to set up government-approved repositories that keep copies
   of mathematical keys for decoding encrypted information, so
   law enforcement officials can decode private communications
   if granted a court order.
   Those policies have met with uniform distaste on the part
   of the industry executives, who say that widespread use of
   strong encryption is essential to the success of electronic
   commerce over the Internet. They argue that the
   administration's export restrictions on strong
   cryptography, determined by the length of the key needed to
   unlock the code, are hurting business abroad where
   competitors can freely offer stronger encryption software.
   Producing a separate weaker version of encryption software
   for foreign markets not only raises costs but is becoming
   pointless because hackers can now access computers powerful
   enough to break the weaker code.
   "The federal government's ideas on encryption are based on
   a situation which may have existed 10 or 20 years ago with
   very little realization of the realities of today," said
   Sen. Leahy. "We're not going to sell our computer programs
   if we have outdated computer technology, especialiy if
   people can buy it in Europe or Asia."
   The two new bills would allow for the export of much
   stronger encryption provided that level of security was
   "generally available." Sen. Leahy's proposal states that
   the key-escrow scheme will be voluntary, and establishes
   rules by which companies rather than government agencies
   would hold the keys for decoding data. These companies
   would be liable for abuse of keys and subject to strict
   procedures for releasing the keys to law enforcement.       Though industry executives welcome the bills, they say the
   measures don't go far enough to unshackle high-tech
   companies. Thomas Parenty, product manager at the database
   firm Sybase Inc., said that both bills represent "a good
   start." But by allowing U.S. companies to export encryption
   only as strong as that which is available overseas, Mr.
   Parenty said, the bills won't allow them to innovate and
   produce superior products.
   And putting keys in the hands of third-party companies,
   they say, is still likely to meet industry opposition.
   People familiar with the bills said one motivation is to
   build support for a private version of the key-escrow
   concept, which could be an opportunity for several
   companies who are selling products based on the idea. "It
   would establish the legal framework for their
   implementation to go forward," said James Bidzos, chief
   executive officer of RSA Data Security Inc., an
   encryption-software company in Redwood City, Calif.

      transform them, every error that creeps in will go

Instead of competing on the       basis of inside information, those agents will compete       by adding value in other ways.       The Internet will put some intermediaries out of       business, but it will create more work for others. And       among these will be not only  suppliers of familiar       services, but also a new breed monitoring Internet       sites, collecting news and information, and repackaging       it -- folk, in other words, like Mr Gates.

The New York Times, March 4, 1996, p. D4.    Compromise Bills Due on Data Encryption       Industry Opponents and Civil Libertarians Are Lukewarm,       at Best    By John Markoff    Legislation will be introduced in the House and the Senate    tomorrow in an effort to break the deadlock between the    computer industry and the Clinton Administration over the    control and export of software and hardware used to    scramble electronic data.    So far, though, the proposed measures have received only    cautious endorsement from industry executives, while    civil-liberties and privacy groups say they are worried    that the bills would enable the Government to decode    scrambled transmissions.    Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and    Representative Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, plan    to introduce similar bills that affirm the right of    Americans to use any type of data-coding equipment without    restriction and prohibit the mandatory use of special keys    that would allow law-enforcement agencies to read scrambled    data. Their bills would also make it a crime to use    encryption technology in committing a crime and would    permit the export of data-coding software and hardware if    similar technology was available from a foreign supplier.    Data-coding, or encryption, technology is based on    mathematical formulas that rely on the immense computing    challenge inherent in factoring large numbers. Until    recently, such technology was largely used by military and    intelligence organizations and by some corporations like    banks. As electronic mail and commerce have become    increasingly accessible, however, the technology has become    more controversial.    In April 1993, the Clinton Administration proposed a    national data-encryption standard known as Clipper, based    on a system that would have made it possible for    law-enforcement agencies, if authorized by a court, to    decode private voice and data communications.    The Clipper initiative has been strongly opposed by    industry executives and privacy advocates. They argue that    reliable coding technology is essential for commerce and    privacy protection on the Internet. They also say that    strict export rules are increasingly hindering the ability    of United States corporations to compete with foreign    suppliers.    The proposed legislation would ease some current    restrictions on the exporting of data-coding systems, but    civil libertarians still see areas of concern.    "The bills relax export controls, which is clearly a step    in the right direction," conceded Marc Rotenberg, director    of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington    research and policy organization. But the negatives, he    said, were that the bills opened the door to Government    access to private transactions "and criminalize the use of    cryptography when it is used to perpetrate a crime."    Industry officials said they expected the legislation to    stir little enthusiasm from corporate users. "Corporate    America is absolutely unwilling to give a third party    control of their data," said Jim Bidzos, chief executive of    RSA Data Security, a maker of encryption software based in    Redwood City, Calif.

Does anyone how to get a copy of the report on "privacy    enhancing technologies - the path to anonymity" cited in    this paper from the Canberra/OECD conference on Feb 7-8:           Issues Facing Government : Meeting Public Concerns    Kevin O'Connor    Privacy Commissioner, Australia    [Giant snip]       In my own sphere of activity, there is some discussion       taking place over the potential of new technologies and       applications to assist with privacy protection.  A       recent report from the Dutch and Ontario Privacy       Commissioners entitled Privacy enhancing technologies -       the path to anonymity, offers some intriguing       suggestions about the potential of public key       cryptography for use in digital signatures to act as       'identity protectors' - allowing transactions to be       completed and accounted for without the true identity of       the participants needing to be known.       While there are some obvious concerns about such       technologies from a law enforcement perspective, which       we have already heard about from the previous speaker,       these should not be insuperable obstacles.  On the other       hand, the registration of digital signatures and public       keys, with sufficient integrity to gain commercial and       governmental confidence, itself raises additional       privacy concerns.  The complex issues involved are only       just starting to be addressed. ...    -----    Encouragingly, another paper by Matthew Bowcock           states:    [Big snip]       Controls on Encryption Technology       There has been much heated debate worldwide about       restrictions on the use of encryption technology, so       that law enforcement and national security agencies can       continue to intercept communications. Two questions are       worth asking in this debate.       Firstly, is interception of private communications a       governmental right, which must therefore be protected in       the face of technological change, or is it an accidental       consequence of the weaknesses of the communication       techniques that we have been using? I would argue that       it is the latter and that there is no community       obligation to protect it.       Secondly, is a country better served by a vibrant,       efficient, electronic economy, using trusted secure       communication techniques for its day to day business, or       by attempting to reduce organised crime by restricting       use of technology? So far, much of the opposition to       restrictions on the use of encryption technology has       centred around a right to privacy and civil libertarian       issues. Perhaps, instead, we need to quantify the       opportunity cost, in economic terms, of delayed and       lower levels of adoption of electronic commerce by the       business community because the security mechanisms are       not sufficiently trustworthy. It may be that the cost to       the economy of restricting the use of encryption       technology outweighs the benefits to the community. ...

Mr. Bell, The Economist terrorism report is unusally thoughtful and open-minded, and
considers the benefits of savaging innocents from the perspectives of a
variety of deeply held beliefs. But after revewing the plenitude of those who have murdered for
understandable motives, it does point to a very small group who truly lack
any rationale for earthly comprehension. Not that I want to get on your "Shit, shoot that fucker" list, but take a
look at it to double-check that you're not skydiving into the wrong
maelstrom. It's pretty long, but I'll gladly scan it and send it along. If not that, read Tim's pithy warning today about shit-stormtroopers
provoked by the daredeviltry of extreme-unctuous freedom fighters.

The Economist, March 2, 1996, pp. 23-25.    What is terrorism?       The use of terror is more widespread and effective than       is generally recognised    June 1914: a young man in Sarajevo steps up to a carriage    and fires his pistol. The Archduke Eerdinand dies. Within    weeks, the first world war has begun. The 1940s: the French    resistance kill occupying troops when and how they can.    June 1944: at Oradour-sur-Glane, in central France, German    SS troops take revenge, massacring 642 villagers. August    1945: the United States Air Eorce drops the world's first    nuclear weapons. Some 190,000 Japanese die, nearly all of    them civilians. Within days the second world war has ended.    Which of these four events was an act of terrorism? Which    achieved anything? Which, if any, will history judge as    justified? And whose history? Terrorism is not the simple,    sharp-edged, bad-guy phenomenon we all love to condemn. No    clear line marks off politics from the threat of force,    threat from use, use from covert or open war. Who is or is    not a terrorist? The suicide bomber, the rebel guerrilla,    the liberation front, the armed forces of the state?    In practice, what act or person earns the label depends on    who wants to apply it. To Ulster loyalists all IRA violence    is terrorism; to Sinn Fein it is part of a legitimate    war.To many Israelis, everyone from the suicidebombers in    Jerusalem or Ashkelon to the Hizbollah grenade-thrower in    South Lebanon is a terrorist; to many Arabs during the 1982    Lebanon war, the worst terrorists in the Middle East were    the -- entirely legitimate, uniformed -- Israel Defence    Force.    If the concept is not to vanish into all-embracing fudge,    two distinctions can be drawn, though habitually they are    not. Terrorism is indeed about terror; not just violence,    but its use to spread terror. And the violence is aimed    specifically at civilians.    Classical terrorism, ideological rather than territorial,    reveals the niceties. Recent decades saw West Germany's    Baader-Meinhof gang and Red Army Faction murder prominent    businessmen such as Alfred Herrhausen and Jurgen Ponto    (bosses of Germany's two largest banks, Deutsche and    Dresdner respectively. Italy's Red Brigades murdered Aldo    Moro, a former prime minister. Its far right in 1980 blew    up a train in Bologna station, killing 84 people. Which of    these was truly terrorism? Arguably, only the last. It was    an act of indiscriminate violence to terrorise citizens at    large; the others were discriminate assassinations to win    publicity and display power.    Likewise, lobbing mortar-bombs into a British army base in    South Armagh may have deadly results, but it is guerrilla    warfare. Planting a bomb that kills a dozen diners in a    restaurant is terrorism. The suicide bomber in Jerusalem    was a terrorist; the Hizbollah fighter in South Lebanon    attacking Israeli army patrols is not.    Even in the distinction between guerrilla warfare and    terrorism, there are grey areas. The soldier in a tank is    a military target. What about one in a jeep escorting    civilian vehicles? Or returning on a bus from leave? A bus    that may -- and was, when a suicide bomber attacked it in    Gaza last April -- be carrying civilians too?    There are, in contrast, distinctions often made that ought    not to be. What is or is not "terrorism" does not depend on    the badness or goodness of the cause, nor on whether those    espousing it have the chance to express their demands    democratically. When President James Garfield was    assassinated in America in the same year, 1881, that a    Russian terrorist group blew up Tsar Alexander II, the    Russians wrote an open letter condemning Garfield's killers    and arguing that:       In a land where the citizens are free to express their       ideas, and where the will of the people does not merely       make the law but appoints the person who is to carry the       law into effect, political assassination is the       manifestation of despotism ... Despotism is always       blameworthy and force can only be justified when       employed to resist force.    Yet despotism does not justify throwing bombs into crowds    (as the group sometimes did).    The fact is that a good cause may use terrorism just as a    bad one may. South Africa has provided a clear example. The    ending of white dominance was a plainly good cause. For the    most part, the African National Congress used mass    demonstrations and industrial sabotage to advance its    cause. But the men who shot up a white church congregation    or planted a bomb outside a cinema were terrorists in the    purest sense of the word.    Nor does the terrorists' ultimate success or failure alter    the truth. Menachem Begin got to lead a country; Yasser    Arafat may do; Velupillai Prabhakaran, who leads the Tamil    Tigers, probably will not. None of that changes the fact    that Deir Yassin (a massacre of Palestinian villagers by    Israelis fighting to establish their state), the killing of    11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972 and this    year's Tamil Tiger bomb in Colombo were all acts of terror.    The terror of the state    So much for the underdogs. Can there be terrorist    governments too? The Americans certainly think so when they    accuse Libya or Iran of supporting international terrorism.    In the cold war, international terrorists were used to wage    war by proxy: the East German regime provided safe houses    for Baaders and Meinhofs; the modern era's most notorious    terrorist, the gun-for-hire Carlos the Jackal, made his    career in this world of state-sponsored terrorism.    All that was diplomacy by terror. Can a recognised    government also be guilty of terrorism against its own    people?    Yes. Stalin used terror systematically to consolidate his    power -- random murders of Communist-Party members and army    officers in the 1930s, massacres and exiles of smaller    ethnic groups throughout his rule. Much of Latin America    practised state terrorism in recent decades. The brasshat    regimes of the day faced left-wing, sometimes terrorist    movements. Many fought back with terror. And not just    through paramilitaries or unacknowledged death squads. The    infamous massacre at El Mozote in El Salvador in 1981 was    the work of that country's regular army. The unit that did    it had a cheerful song of its own,       "Somos Guerreros":       We are warriors,       Warriors all!       We are setting out to kill       A mountain of terrorists.    What in fact they killed was over 500 peasants; probably    the worst "official" massacre in Latin America's recent    history.    Can regular armies, in regular war, be guilty of terrorism?    The answer, surely, is yes. Look at the Japanese rape of    Nanking in 1937, when not hundreds or thousands but ten of    thousands of civilians were murdered, to terrorise the rest    of China. Then go a step further. Can the armies of proud    democracies be guilty too? A century ago, the rich world,    with the rules of war that it claimed to use, would have    called attacking civilians impermissable. The modern world    has other ideas. The Allied bombing of Germany was aimed at    civilians in the hope of shattering morale: in short,    terror. The fire bombing of Tokyo and the atomic weapons    that vaporised Hiroshima and Nagasaki were arguably aimed    at government morale, not that of Japan's population. Their    victims did not notice the difference.    Who kills and how?    What use, one can ask, is a definition so wide that it can    go from Stalin to the American air force? There are two    answers.    First, it is a reminder that terrorism, historically, has    been the tool of the strong, not the weak. Medieval armies,    having taken a besieged town, would slaughter some or all    of the citizens to encourage other towns to surrender    faster. During India's struggle for independence, by far    the worst terror was the Amritsar massacre in 1919, when    British-officered troops shot up a political gathering, and    carried on shooting until the bullets ran out; 379    civilians died (and it worked: the rebellious province of    Punjab returned to order). In contrast, discriminate    assassination was the typical weapon of the 19th-century    anarchist and nihilist.    By and large, true random terrorism has come in the past 30    years, as in the Bologna train bomb, the recent nerve-    gassing of the Tokyo metro by a religious cult, or the    Oklahoma City bomb; all three crimes were aimed at no    matter whom for a purpose so vague or Utopian as to seem    irrelevant, except to the deranged. Even in this period    most -- not all -- IRA killing was aimed at defined    targets: soldiers, policemen, individual Protestant farmers    in border areas. The Basque violence of ETA has often    followed this pattern. Peru's Shining Path guerrillas are    truer terrorists, but even they (mostly) prefer the    tactics, honed by the Vietcong, of killing officials, not    just (as in some infamous massacres) everyone in sight.    Algeria's and Sri Lanka's terrorists today probably have    the strongest claim to be called spreaders of true random    terror.    The second thing one can learn from the wide definition of    terrorism is that the phenomenon is neither uniquely    wicked, nor -- still less -- uniquely deadly. People fight    with the weapons they have: knives, Semtex, rifles,    fighter-bombers. All their users are alike convinced of    their own righteousness, all kill and all their victims are    equally dead. What they are not is equal in number. The    Munich terrorists killed 11 Israelis; Israel's retaliation    against the Lebanese town of Nabatiyeh, however justified,    killed about 100 Arabs. The State Department has totted up    the deaths due to international terrorism from 1968 through    1995. Its total, and it defines terrorism broadly, is    8,700. Twenty-four hours of air raids killed six times as    many civilians at Dresden in 1945. One is a crime, says    international law, the other a legitimate act of war.    The response    Is all this mere word-play? It is not. It crucially affects    responses to terrorism.    One true difference between a terrorist group and a    government is that the group is almost impossible to smash.    You can destroy or seize a government's ability to make    conventional war; you will never get every terrorist's last    stick of dynamite or timing mechanism, and it requires    wonderfully few terrorists to keep a civilised society on    edge.    But many other imagined differences are less great than    they might appear. It is a common error to suppose that    because terrorism is not war, and because its weapons are    not the full panoply of war, then the psychology of    terrorists must be different too. Of course, there are    plenty of curious specimens among terrorism's ranks: Carlos    the Jackal, now in French hands, was not just any old    gunman; or consider Abimael Guzman, an academic who until    his capture in 1992 led Peru's Shining Path movement. Every    terrorist must have personal devotion to the cause -- he    is, after all, risking his liberty, and often his life; not    many reluctant army conscripts, drafted by a legitimate    government, are likely feel the same way. And plainly, say    those who know them, the IRA and other groups include    people who enjoy violence for its own sake.    But so do most armies. And most governments, once at war,    can produce remarkable devotion to the national cause. In    its own terms, a warring terrorist group, like a warring    government, is "pursuing diplomacy by other means", even if    its means of war are different. It too is subject to highs    and lows, to war fatigue and collapses of morale, to    premature celebration of a battle won as if it had been the    war. It too can be threatened with a heavy hand; some of    its members may be wooed with a lighter one.    Terrorists, like governments, may be rational: they are    pursuing a policy they hope will succeed. And the more it    works, the more vigorously they will pursue it.    It is always hard, when terrorism is just one element in a    complex pattern of events, to identify its impact. But the    world is manifestly a different place because of acts of    terror. In 1948, the Israelis blew up the King David hotel,    the administrative centre of the British rulers of    Palestine. The atrocity helped persuade the British to    leave.    Often, terrorists help advance a general cause, but not    their own particular aims. That may be the case with the    IRA. Irish Republican terrorism helped dramatise the    nationalist cause throughout periods of discriminatory    Protestant rule. And Britain has made concessions to the    nationalists. In the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985, the    British accepted the right of the Irish Republic to a say    in a province of the United Kingdom; in the two    governments' Downing Street declaration of 1993 Britain    said it had "no selfish strategic or economic interest in    Northern Ireland". It is hard to imagine any other    government saying such things of its own accord. Yet    whether it was the IRA that brought this about, or    persistent pressure from the Irish government and peaceful    nationalists in the north, is debatable. The leader of the    biggest nationalist party in Northern Ireland, John Hume,    argues that IRA terrorism has been the main obstacle to a    peaceful settlement in Ulster. If so, the IRA may also have    harmed the nationalist cause.    And sometimes, terrorists can advance both a general cause    and themselves. The PLO'S campaigns in the 1970s made the    organisation the dominant representative of the    Palestinians. They also helped solidify the Palestinians'    own sense of their distinct identity, which until then had    been relatively weak.    Just as terrorists make a difference to the world, so    changes in the world make a difference to terrorists. It    was not just their own weakness that led the British to    quit India, or later Cyprus (whose EOKA gunmen, though    damned as terrorists, were more like guerrilla fighters),    or later still Kenya (where they faced a genuinely    terrorist liberation movement). Weakness played its part,    but so did a world view that said colonial empires had had    their day. Much the same was true in South Africa. F.W. de    Klerk, probably the last white president there, may not    have been a more virtuous man than the architects of    apartheid who preceded him. But he was and is a realist,    who lived in different days and under different pressures.    In that case, a just cause plainly helped the terrorists.    For Muslim countries the Palestinian cause was no less    just. Western countries, guiltily aware of the horrors of    Jewish history, disagreed, and it took 20 years of Israeli    occupation and the intifada, the Palestinian uprising of    1987-90, to persuade them that the PLO too had a case. It    is still not one that much impresses Americans; and though    other westerners may have sympathy with Palestinian dreams    of statehood, any movement that still seeks a quite    different thing, the destruction of Israel, on top will --    very rightly -- find that its bombers face a western world    united behind the Jewish state.    Like the rest of us -- mostly    In all this, what is different about dealing with    terrorism? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is not very    much.    Any government has its own interests, its own pressures,    its concessions it can make and those it cannot. It fights    its conventional wars with tanks and aircraft, its    small-scale wars -- partly terrorist, mostly not -- with    intelligence men and small arms. It cannot, usually, zap    the terrorists' territory as it could that of a hostile    state. But its psychology will be much the same in the two    cases -- and so will that of its enemies. The terrorist or    suicide bomber or gunman or fighter or liberation hero is    not different from other men (men, sic; rarely have women    played any notable part, any more than they have in    old-fashioned war).    With one notable exception: the nutters, whether with a    cause or no evident cause at all. The American way-out    redneck who thinks he has to plant a bomb, when he could    vote for Pat Buchanan, is beyond any but a psychiatrist's    reach. So too elitist solipsists like the Baader-Meinhof    mob, convinced that murder was justified because they knew    all the answers and it was society that was out of step.    Among the almost causeless, Italy's far right may have    sought instability, but for what? That was never clear. And    no known concession could have led Japan's Aum Shinrikyo    cult to put aside its chemistry set.    Is it coincidence that three of these four groups seem to    specialise in the true terrorism, the random murder of    civilians for terror's sake? Perhaps it is not.

The Washington Post, March 11, 1996, p. A18.
   Security and Software [Editorial]
   The number of computer users continues to grow, but use of
   the Internet for business and financial transactions isn't
   keeping pace. At least, that's the complaint of many who
   expected a flood of Americans to go on-line for banking,
   publishing and mail-ordering -- with tremendous profits to
   the on-line industries that handle these services. One big
   reason for the lag is customer concern about the safety of
   information, from credit-card numbers to bank balances and
   business secrets, in the hacker-rich environment of the
   Internet -- an eminently reasonable concern that many in
   the industry believe can be addressed only by the wider use
   and availability of sophisticated "encryption software,"
   which scrambles information en route, making it
   indecipherable to anyone who doesn't hold the key to the
   code.
   The sense that encryption technology holds the key to
   future economic growth on the Internet is pushing an arcane
   but intense argument between the Clinton administration and
   the computer industry over whether to lift existing
   restrictions on the export of the most powerful encryption
   software. The administration, especially its law
   enforcement agencies, bars on national security grounds the
   export of encryption software above a certain difficulty
   level, saying that it needs to be able, if neqessary, to
   seek and obtain the equivalent of a permit to wiretap. The
   makers of the software argue that these restrictions are
   ruinous for U.S. competitiveness in the international
   market because foreign customers want the most secure
   encryption available. Some civil liberties organizations
   argue that the restrictions are an invasion of customers'
   privacy rights.
   Legislation introduced this month in both the House and the
   Senate would ease the export restrictions while attempting
   to meet some of the government's security concerns. Code
   makers would deposit a "spare key" to any exported
   encryption software with a trusted third-party agency -- a
   compromise the Justice Department and national security
   agencies also have been pursuing in talks with the
   industry, but at which the industry hesitates because it
   fears that the existence of "spare keys lying around" would
   cause potential customers to balk. (The Justice Department
   also would like a spare-key agreement for encryption
   software sold domestically, but has less leverage because
   such sales require no license.)
   The legislation would heavily penalize any "key holder"
   agency that provides an unauthorized copy to anyone besides
   the government. But it also would make it legal to export
   any encryption technology that is already "generally
   available" -- for instance, in stores or on domestic
   computer bulletin boards.
   Such a sweeping change, law enforcement authorities fear,
   could render the other barriers and safeguards in the bill
   close to academic in the borderless, lightning-quick world
   of Internet transmission. Once it's widely available
   overseas, "uncrackable" software or hardware can't be
   recalled. The U.S. intelligence agencies with their
   superior computing power can still crack most coded
   software, if not immediately, then much faster than 99.9
   percent of ordinary commercial hackers. But that doesn't
   mean their concerns should be shrugged off. Like arms
   sales, encryption technology sales have implications for
   traditional national security interests as well as the
   economic kind. The urgent interest both sides share is to
   get this resolved soon.

      Privacy-enhancing Technolgies: The Path to Anonymity

      Information and Privacy Commissioner/Ontario, Canada
      August 1995

         _________________________________________________________
   Introduction [Excerpts]
   The Dutch Data Protection Authority (the Registratiekamer)
   and the Information and Privacy Commissioner for the
   Province of Ontario, Canada (IPC) are both privacy
   protection agencies that oversee compliance with their
   respective juridiction's privacy laws. The Registratiekamer
   and IPC decided to pool their resources and collaborate in
   the production of a report exploring privacy technologies
   that permit transactions to be conducted anonymously. The
   first international paper of this type includes a survey of
   companies that might be expected to offer such
   technologies, and organizations that might use them.
   In addition to anonymous transactions, the range of
   security features commercially available for use and the
   types of services actually being used by various
   organizations were also examined (see 2.1 Survey
   methodology). The Registratiekamer and IPC felt that a
   joint report outlining the practices followed in their
   respective jurisdictions would shed some light on this
   little-studied but extremely important area where the
   future of privacy-protection in an electronic world may
   lie.
   Consumer polls have repeatedly shown that individuals value
   their privacy and are concerned with its potential loss
   when so much of their personal information is routinely
   stored in computer databases, over which they have no
   control. Protecting one's identity goes hand in hand with
   preserving one's ability to remain *anonymous* -- a key
   component of privacy. While advances in information and
   communications technology have fuelled the ability of
   organizations to keep massive amounts of personal data,
   this has increasingly jeopardized the privacy of those
   whose information is being collected. Minimizing
   identifying data would restore privacy considerably, but
   would still permit the collection of needed information.
   When assessing the need for identifiable data during the
   course of a transaction, the key question one must start
   with is: how much personal information/data is truly
   required for the proper functioning of the information
   system involving this transaction? This question must also
   be asked at the outset -- prior to the design and
   development of any new system. But this is not the case
   today.
   This question is rarely asked at all since there is such a
   clear preference in favour of collection identifiable data,
   'the more the better'. However, with the growth of
   networked communications and the ability to link a wide
   number of diverse databases electronically, people will
   become more and more reluctant to leave behind a trail of
   identifiable data. What is needed is a paradigm shift away
   from a 'more is better' mindset to a minimalist one. Is it
   possible to minimize the amount of identifiable data
   presently collected and stored in information systems, but
   still meet the needs of those collecting the information?
   We believe that it is.
   The technology needed to achieve this goal exists today. We
   will describe some of the privacy technologies that permit
   one to engage in transactions without revealing one's
   identity by introducing the concept of an *identity
   protector*. The notion of *pseudonymity* will also be
   introduced as an integral part of protecting one's
   identity. These technologies are available now and within
   our reach; what is needed is the will to implement privacy
   technologies over the tracking technologies that are in use
   today.
   When organizations are asked what measures they have in
   place to protect privacy, they usually point to their
   efforts at keeping information secure. While the use of
   security measures to prevent unauthorized access to
   personal data is a very important component of privacy, it
   does not equal privacy protection. The latter is a much
   broader concept which starts with the questioning of the
   initial collection of the information to ensure there is a
   good reason for doing so and that its uses will be
   restricted to legitimate ones that the data subject has
   been advised of. Once the data has been collected, security
   and confidentiality become paramount. Effective security
   and confidentiality will depend on the implementation of
   measures to create a secure environment.
   Alternatively, instead of restricting the focus to security
   alone, a more comprehensive approach would be to seek out
   ways in which technology may be used to enhance the
   protection of informational privacy or data protection. We
   use the term *privacy technologies* to refer to a variety
   of technologies that safeguard personal privacy by
   minimizing or eliminating the collection of identifiable
   data.
   Not only are measures that safeguard privacy becoming an
   important mark of quality, but increasingly, consumers are
   demanding that organizations pay attention to their privacy
   concerns. Social acceptance of demands for one's personal
   information, without adequate assurances of protection,
   appears to be on the decline. Not only do consumers wish to
   maintain control over their personal data and be informed
   of its uses, but insufficient protection will be reason
   enough for consumers to take their business elsewhere -- to
   companies that follow privacy-protective practices.

   "Beyond the Last Theorem."
   On Diophantine equations, by mathematician Dorian Goldfeld.
      To mathematicians, the statement and proof of the STW
      conjecture were as revolutionary as the first mingling
      of waters in the Panama Canal. Until that point, the
      mathematics of elliptic functions and the mathematics of
      rigid motions had developed in isolation from each other
      and in strikingly different ways. The study of elliptic
      curves was a branch of number theory, small, specialized
      and provincial -- not unlike the study of Diophantine
      equations. In contrast, the study of rigid motions was
      a bustling, sophisticated suburb of topology, geometry
      and analysis, with many applications to engineering and
      physics. Mathematicians had been working on rigid
      motions intensely for a hundred years and had
      accumulated a vast armamentarium of powerful
      mathematical machinery. By suggesting that the two
      fields could be linked, Shimura, Taniyama and Weil
      delivered that heavy machinery to the construction site
      of elliptic curves; by proving that the link held, Wiles
      and Taylor started the engines. The result has been a
      frenzy of productive mathematical work that has
      benefited each field and is likely to lead to solutions
      of outstanding problems in other fields as well. ...
      If the ABC conjecture yields, mathematicians will find
      themselves staring into a cornucopia of solutions to
      long-standing problems. Some of those problems are of
      more than theoretical interest. Nowadays many methods of
      ensuring the security of electronic mail and other
      computerized transactions depend heavily on number
      theory, as programmers develop ciphers based on
      time-consuming problems in arithmetic. For example, a
      highly popular technique depends on the difficulty of
      determining all the large prime factors of a very large
      number.
      In principle, it should also be straightforward to
      create a cipher based on the difficulty of solving
      problems in Diophantine analysis. The major hurdle is
      the solvability barrier: the number of variables above
      which a Diophantine equation becomes impervious to
      attack. Any cipher based on an equation with that many
      variables should be absolutely secure. But where is the
      threshold? All anyone knows is that it probably lies
      between three and nine variables. At current or
      foreseeable processing speeds, a nine-variable cipher is
      impracticably slow, even for the fastest computers. A
      four-variable Diophantine cipher, however, would be both
      practical and extremely useful.

   In "America's Information Edge," Joseph S. Nye, Jr.  former
   Chairman of the National Intelligence Council and Assistant
   Secretary of Defense, and Admiral William A. Owen, former
   Vice Chairman of the JCS, argue that information technology
   is transforming knowledge, and thereby power. They write of
   a "system of systems, an integration of ISR, C4I and
   precision force, which represents a qualitative change in
   U.S. military capabilities." They envision informational
   "soft power" -- the ability to achieve outcomes in
   international affairs through attraction rather than
   coercion -- as reinforcing the "information umbrella"
   shielding allies in lieu of the nuclear option.
   In "A Revolution in Warfare," Eliot A. Cohen, Professor of
   Strategic Studies at Johns Hopkins, takes issue with Nye
   and Owen on the radical impact of information technology,
   and argues that its revolutionary dazzle may distort
   historical understanding of the more general political and
   economic forces that are reshaping international and
   military affairs. He observes that misunderstanding of
   revolutionary technology all too often has had unexpected,
   disastrous, consequences: "A revolution in military affairs
   is under way. It will require changes of a magnitude that
   military people still do not completely grasp and political
   leaders do not fully imagine."

   The key issue for the Net is not smut, it is the use of
   encryption
      Growing fears that Big Brother might decide to read your
      E-mail.
   By Denise Caruso
   The current uproar over the Internet is about smut and what
   can be made public on the global computer network. But the
   next public-policy tangle will be about what we're allowed
   to keep secret.
   Earlier this month, a bipartisan group from both houses of
   Congress introduced versions of legislation called the
   Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996. This bill,
   which outlines the proper use of encryption technologies
   for privacy and security, is by far the most critical piece
   of Internet legislation yet introduced.
   Encryption uses a mathematical key to scramble and
   unscramble digital messages so they can be read only by
   their intended recipients and not by human or electronic
   snoopers. Legislation about this powerful technology is
   especially important when viewed in light of two laws
   already on the books.
   One of these, the Digital Telephony Act, signed into law in
   1994, allows Federal law-enforcement agencies to update the
   telephone network with the most pervasive surveillance
   equipment in history.
   The other, the freshly signed Communications Decency Act,
   bans "indecent" material from the Internet. It is a law
   that many legislators seemed to feel was on shaky ground
   even as Congress was passing it. A constitutional challenge
   to the law is currently being heard in Federal District
   Court in Philadelphia.
   Though the encryption bill as written is receiving
   qualified support from industry and civil libertarians,
   some worry that changes made in committee could make the
   bill too restrictive, completing a triumvirate of Big
   Brother legislation that would give law enforcement the
   ability and rationale to monitor all the electronic
   messages of citizens, leaving little or no recourse for
   private or secure communication.
   Such restrictions threaten to suffocate the Internet. As
   new users and businesses flock daily to the Internet, their
   need to protect confidential business data and messages
   becomes a key issue in making the Net safe enough to be
   useful. Computer security experts say that many of today's
   problems on the Net -- minors getting access to
   pornography, security breaches of corporate data, the need
   to prove one's identity -- could be solved by using
   encryption.
   Today, using encryption of any kind is still perfectly
   legal inside the United States. Historically, it was mostly
   used to protect secret military communications, so the
   technology is still classified as munitions -- the same
   threat to national security as a boatload of artillery
   shells. Thus any products containing encryption are subject
   to strict export controls.
   Law-enforcement and national security officials say that
   widespread use of strong encryption would enable terrorists
   and organized-crime syndicates to communicate with
   impunity. They say export control is the only way to keep
   this genie in its bottle, at least when it comes to
   foreign, not domestic crime.
   In addition, security experts have persuaded the Clinton
   Administration to propose an encryption method called "key
   escrow" that would give the Government access to
   information even after it had been encrypted. Key-escrow
   systems generate a decrypting key that is held by a trusted
   third party. When law-enforcement agents show up with a
   court warrant, the trustee hands over the key to unlock the
   message.
   So far, the Clinton Administration's proposals, which
   include a key-escrow system called Clipper have been
   universally reviled by both civil libertarians and the
   computer industry, which claims it stands to be deprived of
   up to $60 billion annually by the year 2000 because of
   export controls. They argue that any country today can make
   and sell encryption products stronger than what can be
   legally exported from the United States and that people
   won't use a system like key escrow because it has a
   built-in security compromise.
   One defender of key-escrow policy is Dorothy Denning, a
   professor of computer science at Georgetown University and
   a consultant to the military industry. She argued in a
   letter to Senator Patrick J. Leahy Democrat of Vermont --
   one of the sponsors of the new legislation -- that such a
   system was vital to public safety and security.
   James Barksdale, president of the Netscape Communications
   Corporation, whose popular Web-browser software has
   built-in encryption capabilities, called Ms. Denning's
   solution a "stopgap measure."
   "Key escrow is an unworkable idea, and we do not support
   it," Mr. Barksdale said. "Key escrow will be defeated just
   like Prohibition was defeated by bathtub gin -- all it took
   was a big bag of sugar and a long weekend."
   Policy watchdogs like the Center for Democracy and
   Technology and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, both
   outspoken advocates for privacy rights and due process,
   agree that the bill is headed in the right direction. It
   does not dictate the use of a key escrow system, eases
   export controls for "mass market" products (like
   Netscape's), prohibits any restriction on the domestic use
   or sale of encryption, and provides a "personal use" policy
   for American travelers who use encryption while outside the
   country.
   But the bill is sure to face a fight as it moves through
   the House and the Senate, and the key-escrow and
   export-control proponents marshal their experts.
   David Farber, a professor of computer science at the
   University of Pennsylvania and a board member of the
   Electronic Frontier Foundation, says encryption policy
   always turns into "a religious discussion" between those
   who fear terrorism and those who want to live without fear
   of constant surveillance.
   But, he adds, if you take privacy discussions to the
   people, their attitudes are pretty clear. " If you ask the
   American public what they think of national I.D. cards, for
   example, a huge percentage are opposed to them," he said.
   "Why? They're not hiding anything. They just don't want the
   Government to have that type of power."

Wall Street Journal, March 26, 1996, p. B4.
   Researchers Find Big Security Flaw In Java Language
   By Don Clark
   A team of Princeton University researchers said they
   discovered the most serious security flaw yet in the widely
   used Java programming language from Sun Microsystems Inc.
   The flaw could make it possible for unscrupulous hackers to
   destroy files or cause other types of damage on any
   personal computer that uses Netscape Communications Corp.'s
   Navigator program, said Edward Felten, a Princeton
   assistant professor of computer science who helped discover
   the flaw.
   Netscape Navigator, which uses Java, is the most popular
   software for browsing the Internet's World Wide Web. Java
   enables the creation of tiny programs, called applets, that
   are transferred from a Web site on the Internet to a PC
   running Netscape Navigator.
   Mr. Felten said that unscrupulous people who discovered the
   flaw could boobytrap a Web page on the Internet,
   essentially seizing control of the browser software of any
   PC that tapped into that page. At that point, the hackers
   could read or delete an entire hard disk of data files.
   "The consequences of this flaw are as bad as they can be,"
   he said.
   Sun, a computer maker based in Mountain View, Calif.,
   acknowledged the problem. "This one is a serious bug," said
   Marianne Mueller, a senior Sun engineer specializing in
   security issues.
   The company, alerted by Princeton on Friday, is already
   testing a software fix it has developed for the program and
   hopes to distribute it to Netscape and other users in about
   two days. Those companies are then expected to distribute
   updated versions of their Web browsers or other products to
   users.
   "We plan to fix it and get it out to our customers as fast
   as we can," said Jeff Treuhaft, a Netscape product manager.
   Java was originally touted by Sun as a secure language. But
   at least two other flaws have already been discovered in
   the technology, including a less-serious problem uncovered
   by the Princeton team last month. Sun's Ms. Mueller said
   the problems have been correctable details in the way the
   Java code is written, not problems with its basic design.

   "Sold Out." By James Boyle, American University law
   professor
      We are in the middle of an information land grab and no
      one seems to have noticed. Congress is now considering
      the Administration's proposal for intellectual property
      on the Internet, aimed at "saving" this thriving medium.
      Using a far-fetched theory of what constitutes
      "copying," the proposal would turn browsing an Internet
      document into a copyright violation. It would
      effectively privatize much of the public domain by
      transforming the current law of fair use. It would make
      on-line service providers strictly liable for their
      customers' copyright violations, thus giving providers
      an incentive to monitor what you do in cyberspace.
      "Poetry can only be made out of other poems, novels out
      of other novels," as the critic Northrop Frye famously
      put it. The same goes for computer programs, which build
      on the contributions of earlier hackers. Every
      intellectual property claim is a chunk taken out of the
      public domain. If we give someone a software patent over
      basic functions, at some point the public domain will be
      so diminished that future creators will be prevented
      from creating because they won't be able to afford the
      raw materials they need. An intellectual property system
      has to insure that the fertile public domain is not
      converted into a fallow landscape of walled private
      plots.

   Stephen P. Heymann, a Federal prosecutor in Boston, said
   investigators had worked with Harvard to determine a method
   of tracking the suspect that would protect the privacy of
   legitimate users.
   He said that the Harvard system had 16,500 accounts and
   13,000 users and that about 60,000 E-mail messages each day
   moved in and out of the area where investigators were
   looking for the intruder.
   Mr. Heymann said investigators had used a high-speed
   computer to check for 10 to 15 key words that matched the
   intruder's profile. If they were not sure if an electronic
   communication containing a key word was Mr. Ardita's, the
   investigators looked at 80 characters on either side of the
   key word to make that determination. Mr. Heymann said
   investigators believed that only twice had they read a
   complete message that was not Mr. Ardita's.

Financial Times, March 6, 1996, IT Section, p. V.    Network Security: Operating under a cloud of uncertainty       Companies face a complex web of technical, legal and       moral questions    The IT security threat has long been depicted in terms of    wild-eyed hackers hunched over terminals late into the    night. But while there is real cause for concern about    criminal activity over computer networks, large    corporations are very worried about another threat to their    use of electronic communications.    Meanwhile, government restrictions on the use of data    encryption codes in various countries are limiting the    ability of commercial organisations to protect themselves.    Cryptography is at the heart of this dilemma. Governments    all over the world rely on specialist intelligence units to    break down data transmissions from other nations and    individuals while encrypting their own messages.    The US National Security Agency and the UK's Government    Communications HQ are the best-known of these agencies.    The NSA is notorious for obsessive secrecy. Meanwhile, in    the UK, the GCHQ has lifted its traditional reticence in    recent years to offer advice to British companies concerned    with data security.    Mr Roger James, chairman of Cheshire-based communications    software specialist Boldon James, has worked with GCHQ to    define data standards for UK government departments. Mr    James plays down the cloak-and-dagger imagine of GCHQ, but    instead he describes his contact with its staff as    "horribly technical". He also portrays the Cheltenham    code-breakers as "very down-to-earth people".    There are two ways of looking at security, he says "one is    the practical approach, which means accepting that perfect    security is impossible to obtain. The other is the Ivory    Tower approach, which involves dreaming of a world in which    security is absolute. There are a lot of 'practicalists' in    GCHQ".    Mr James, whose clients include the Britannia Building    Society and the German Navy, is active in the European    Electronic Messaging Association. He is concerned at the    lack of a co-ordinated European policy on encryption. And    he fears that effective security measures could become    illegal with the advent of future legislation curbing the    availability of encryption software.    It is illegal at the moment to use strong cryptography    techniques in France without first depositing the key to    unlocking your codes with the French government. UK    companies developing sophisticated security programs find    their software classified as munitions and subject to tight    export restrictions, even within the EC.    In the US, the author of strong encryption program, called    'Pretty Good Privacy', found himself facing a Grand Jury    and possible charges of exporting prohibited technology.    The NSA has proposed that all personal computers made in    the US contain the Clipper Chip. This security feature    would give easy access to any data communications, however    the user chose to encode it. The proposal is currently    stalled, having met with ferocious opposition.    Both suppliers of information technology and industry at    large need to clear a path through this international maze.    The legal structure surrounding the use of encryption    technology is of particular concern to anyone working in    electronic commerce.    "The Clipper Chip debate raised a fundamental moral issue,"    says Mr James. "Software technology means that strong    encryption, previously available only to the military, can    now be obtained by the public. If governments then find    messages hard to break, it leads immediately to a conflict    of interest."    One company that has confronted this apparent conflict of    interest between state and commerce, with its attendant    uncertainty, is the Anglo-Dutch oil giant, Shell. Mr Nick    Mansfield, a Shell technical consultant specialising in    information security, says the company is enthusiastic    about the potential for eliminating paperwork across its    sprawling global operations -- "we are committed to    electronic trading," he says. "We have a vast    electronic-mail network. But there is still a section of    our business where we have to use paper".    Contract agreements are at issue here. Until security can    be absolutely guaranteed, bilateral agreements must be seen    to be tamper-proofed. Shell is about to deploy technology    to secure personal computers and PC servers across the    world. This e-mail security system will cost around L1m in    software purchasing plus L100,000 a year to run. It will    have 4,000 users.    Far from escalating costs, Mr Mansfield explains that    expenses are falling as security improves. Shell used to    run a secure telex network that cost L4m in technology and    required L200,000 a year to support 120 sites. This was    superseded by a secure fax network costing L1m in systems,    plus L100,000 in annual maintenance for 200 sites. The    latest system will expand secure messaging beyond the fax    network's remit.    But setting up this security system involved Shell in a    long and involved process. Its chosen security software is    subject to close scrutiny by the UK authorities, who worked    with Shell to customise the program before it could be    released for use overseas.    While Mr Mansfield is pleased that Shell's security system    is so strong, it required an export licence and he echoes    the concerns of EEMA's Mr James -- "it's a cart and horse    situation. Until governments agree on policy and relax some    restrictions, industry won't be encouraged to development    extreme standards of encryption".    There needs to be a broad European debate on this issue.    Until this complex web of technical, legal and moral    questions are resolved, secure commercial data networks    will be operating under a cloud of uncertainty.

   Pioneers of Cyberspace Move Into Wider Arena
   By Peter H. Lewis
   Cambridge, Mass., March 30 -- Cyberspace is dead, many of
   its electronic pioneers said at a conference here this
   week.
   As the Internet population has grown into the millions,
   what was once a small, self-regulating society of academics
   and computer wizards has been engulfed by mainstream
   culture. But in their efforts to preserve the libertarian
   spirit of the electronic frontier, the original members of
   the cyberspace community have emerged as a political and
   social force.
   "Last year, it was still possible for people to say
   cyberspace is a different place, subject to different laws
   and different rules and that there is a Net culture," said
   Hal Abelson, a professor of computer science and
   engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
   here. "Now you have such a large percentage of the
   population on the Net, it just is not sensible to talk
   about this as some other place anymore. What you are really
   talking about now is the communications fabric of the
   country."
   In what was seen as a clear sign of Internet users new
   power, several members of Congress announced, by telephone
   and through the Internet, new legislation and initiatives
   at the gathering here, the annual Computers, Freedom and
   Privacy Conference. The proposals include the formation of
   an Internet Caucus in Congress and a Senate blll to relax
   the Government's laws restricting the transmission of
   secrets over the global information network.
   "Washington is coming to thls conference in droves," said
   Daniel J. Weltzner, deputy dlrector of the Center for
   Democracy and Technology, one of several public-interest
   groups that seek to influence Government policy related to
   cyberspace, "and I think it's very exciting and promising.
   It's the coming of age of this community."
   The members of Congress were wooing more than 500 of the
   Internet's most prominent champions, who had gathered to
   discuss issues that were once esoteric but are now
   affecting millions of people worldwide: questions of
   privacy, electronic copyrights, computer crime, the nature
   of free speech, digital pornography, electronic cash and
   grassroots electronic democracy.
   The Computers, Freedom and Privacy crowd included its usual
   assortment of computer hackers, academics and self-
   described crypto-anarchists, and even one man wearing video
   goggles with an antenna apparently sprouting from his head.
   But it also included others who wanted to assess the fusion
   of cyberspace and real space: Federal judges, lawmakers,
   White House policy experts, corporate executives and
   law-enforcement agents.
   Senator Conrad Burns, a Republican from the real frontier
   state of Montana, chose the conference to announce, by
   telephone, new legislation that would remove nearly all
   current Government restrictions on the export of
   mass-market encryption software, which is used to send
   secret messages over computer and telephone networks.
   Senator Burns's legislation would also block the
   Administration from imposing as a Government standard any
   form of data encryption that would give law-enforcement
   agencies the ability to decode messages.
   The Senator's bill places him squarely at odds with the
   Clinton Administration and the Justice Department. But Mr.
   Burns said the use of robust data encryption would foster
   the rise of electronic commerce, distance education and
   digital communicatlons, which his large, rural state
   desperately needs in the 21st century. While the bill might
   have little chance of passage this year, conference
   participants were heartened by what appears to be growing
   support in Congress for a relaxation of the Government's
   cryptography policy.
   The proposal drew some opposition. "I think we'll regret it
   down the road," said Dorothy E. Denning, a professor of
   computer sciences at Georgetown University and a computer
   security consultant to the military. Dr. Denning and others
   have argued that the use of unrestricted encryption would
   thwart the ability of law-enforcement and intelligence
   agencies to conduct wiretaps on messages sent by foreign
   spies, terrorists, child pornographers and other criminals.
   On Friday, a bipartisan group of wired lawmakers addressed
   the conference by telephone and Internet to announce the
   formation of a Congressional Internet Caucus. Fewer than
   half of all members of Congress are now on line.
   Representative Rick White, Republican of Washington, said,
   "The idea behind the Internet Caucus is to do two things:
   increase members understanding of the Internet and get more
   members on-line so that people can contact their elected
   representatives on the Internet."

   "At the Justice Dept., Big Government Keeps Getting Bigger"
      In the tug-of-war over downsizing the government,
      Republicans and Democrats still willingly take out the
      checkbook when crime is the issue. Over the past 16
      years, a time in which both parties have controlled
      Congress, Justice's budget has grown by nearly 600
      percent and its work force has expanded from about
      55,000 employees to 94,000.
      Justice is only one part of this phenomenal crime-
      fighting growth. Where the federal government once
      relied mostly on the FBI, the federal buildup is
      creating several large police agencies. More than 41,000
      criminal investigators now work for 32 federal agencies.
      "It has grown like Topsy," says former AG Griffin B.
      Bell. "What I worry about is that people with a badge
      many times can't manage power."
      Senior members of Congress with oversight responsibility
      for DoJ say they are considering ways to consolidate
      the government's law enforcement agencies under a more
      centralized command. Among the models under review are
      the JCS, which aerosols DoD hogstench, and the DCI, who

   Peeking at Your P.C. [Op-Ed]
   By Simson L. Garfinkel
   Cambridge, Mass.
   As more Americans use electronic mail, buy products over
   the Internet and keep their most personal records on
   desktop computers, there is increasing demand for
   cryptography software that can insure the privacy of
   personal electronic communication.
   This technology already exists, but the Government, through
   export-control regulations, effectively bars citizens from
   using it.
   The Government classifies encryption software as munitions,
   because foreign countries can use such programs to hide
   their communications during times of war. To prevent this,
   American companies are largely prohibited from selling to
   foreign customers any programs that include strong coding
   features.
   Unfortunately, that has stifled the domestic market.
   Encryption-software developers find it too expensive to
   create two versions of their programs -- one with strong
   cryptography for domestic use and one with cryptography
   that is weak enough for export. So in the United States,
   developers sell only the weaker cryptography software.
   Last month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced "The
   Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996" to combat
   this problem. But while this measure would increase the
   availability of good cryptography at home, it would limit
   our freedoms in other ways.
   The act would legalize the export of any mass-market
   software if similar technology is already available
   overseas. This would put an end to the futility of
   forbidding such exports at a time when cryptography
   technology is increasingly available around the globe -- in
   libraries and on the Internet. Indeed, the Software
   Publishers Association says that the main result of the
   export regulations simply has been to shift the overseas
   marketing of military-grade cryp tography to foreign
   companies.
   So although the new bill would still prohibit American
   companies from exporting innovative programs, it would at
   least allow them to compete with foreign companies on an
   equal footing.
   However, the Clinton Administration and others oppose this
   minor change, because they are worried that criminals and
   terrorists could use the export liberalization to their own
   advantage.
   Because of this opposition, the bill throws a bone to the
   antiprivacy forces.
   While lifting export controls, it criminalizes some uses of
   cryptography for the first time in our nation's history. It
   would be illegal, for instance, to use encryption that
   interferes with a felony investigation. But the language of
   the bill is so broad that these restrictions could apply to
   a reporter's encrypted computer files.
   The bill also creates legal rules for "key holders" --
   organizations that would be given copies of an individual's
   decryption key, or codebreaker. This means that an
   individual's encoded messages or documents could be
   decoded, under a court order, without his or her knowledge.
   Although the use of key holders would be voluntary under
   the bill, that could easily change and the system could
   become mandatory.
   There is some hope for avoiding all this. Senator Conrad
   Burns, Republican of Montana, plans to introduce a narrower
   bill that focuses simply on liberalizing exports of
   encryption technology.
   The software industry and civil libertarians are already
   supporting this approach -- one that is good not just for
   American business but also for our right to privacy.

      As yet unexplored is the possibility that certain

      are hand-me-downs from this period. The "elitism" and
      didacticism that so gall its opponents may be a morphed
      version of the communist doctrine of vanguard
      leadership. The liberal penchant for government
      gigantism, complex bureaucracy and central planning may
      also have taken root in the liberal admiration of the
      Soviet system in the 1930s.

   Software-Scrambling Proponents Pushing To Ease Export Curbs
   New York -- Champions of encryption software -- computer
   programs that scramble data to thwart eavesdroppers -- this
   week will step up efforts to loosen export restrictions on
   the technology.
   Sen. Conrad Burns (R., Mont.) is expected to introduce
   tomorrow a bill that would ease the federal government's
   export rules. At the same time, industry-trade groups and
   privacy advocates will seek grass-roots support via the
   Internet.
   Current regulations limit the export of encryption software
   to weak systems that are presumed easy for intelligence and
   law-enforcement organizations to crack. The Clinton
   administration has opposed the sale of stronger systems,
   saying terrorists or other foes could use them to conduct
   operations without being monitored.
   But technology executives contend these regulations hamper
   their ability to compete overseas. And because the
   regulations govern any software that incorporates the
   technology to keep data secure, they can impede exports of
   electronic-mail systems, World Wide Web software and other
   Internet-related packages.
   "Right now, the industry is just wondering whether the
   administration will deal with this before we start losing
   market share," said D. James Bidzos, chief executive
   officer of RSA Data Security Inc., a Redwood City, Calif.,
   concern that supplies encryption software.
   The new bill would give software makers free rein to sell
   scrambling systems overseas as long as the same systems are
   widely available in the U.S. Other encryption technologies
   could be exported as well if similar products are already
   generally available outside the U.S.

[Thanks to BC]
   Electronic Engineering Times, April 29, 1996, page 4
   State Dept. Tries To Quash API's for PGP cryptography
   By Loring Wirbel
   Washington -- The Justice Department may have halted
   attempts to bring criminal charges against Phil Zimmermann,
   author of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) public-key
   cryptography algorithms, but the State Department is taking
   an increasingly hard line on PGP. Where once the State had
   restricted itself to warning developers against exporting
   source code with PGP file-encryption routines, it is now
   arguing that application programming interfaces (API)
   allowing PGP program insertion should be subject to control
   under arms-trading statutes.
   Warning letters sent out in the last few weeks reflect the
   bizarre status of cryptography algorithms in the
   government's Export Control Act. Under the International
   Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) promulgated under the
   act, the government can restrict any encryption programs
   the National Security Agency (NSA) is uncomfortable with.
   The new moves represent the first time State has tried to
   extend ITAR to software that only provides hooks for
   encryption packages, however.
   "There is some room to maneuver and make strong arguments
   that the rules on crypto APIs have some serious
   ambiquities," said Kenneth Bass, an attorney specializing
   in export control with the Washington law firm of Venable
   Attorneys at Law. Bass said several companies have received
   warning letters from State, but most do not want to do
   battle with the Federal government.
   Meanwhile, wildly differing rulings in the U.S. District
   Courts on the West and East coasts send mixed messages
   about software embedding crypto algorithms. In refusing to
   dismiss developer Daniel Bernstein's suit against the State
   Department, Judge Marilyn Hall Patel of San Francisco ruled
   in early April that source code can be protected free
   speech.
   "The particular language one chooses  does not  change the
   nature of the language for First Amendment purposes," Patel
   said. "This court can find no meaningful difference between
   computer languages ... and German or French; ... whether
   source code or object code is also functional is
   immaterial." Bernstein seeks to establish that his
   zero-delay private-key program, Snuffle, is not subject to
   ITAR.
   Opposite Rationale
   But on March 22, Judge Charles Richey of Washington
   dismissed Philip Karn's suit against State using almost
   exactly the opposite rationale. Karn, an employee of
   Qualcomm Inc. (San Diego), challenged a ruling that the
   floppy disks accompanying some editions of Bruce Schneier's
   book, *Applied Cryptography*, could be barred from export.
   Judge Richey said the government was free to view
   implemented source code as a munition that could be banned,
   and said Defense Department decisions regarding materials
   covered under export control were precluded from judicial
   review. Karn appealed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
   on April 19. "The stage is being set for some very basic
   issues on souce code and free speech to be decided," said
   attorney Bass.
   So far the API issue has not spurred any suits. Network
   Telesystems Inc. (Santa Clara, Calif.) a TCP/IP stack
   specialist and the one company that has admitted receiving
   a warning from State, said that a PGP API is not central
   enough to its business to warrant making its preservation
   a federal case.
   Company president John Davidson said Network Telesystems
   elected to make its new e-mail package, Confidante, "PGP
   ready" by including a PGP API instead of licensing the
   code. Davidson said the warning must have been the result
   of government officials seeing the press release on the
   package, which has not yet shipped, or a short article in
   a national magazine.
   "We thought it was a misunderstanding at first, since we
   had no resident PGP code," Davidson said. "It didn't seem
   possible that the government could really be talking about
   an interface."
   One computer-security expert said off the record that "NSA
   has told State to watch out for any APIs outside NSA's own
   effort to define a crypto API." NSA is embracing the API
   work of companies like RSA Data Security Inc., the source
   said, "but Zimmermann's PGP work has always been a
   freelance effort, so a compromise is not seen as
   necessary."

Financial Times, May 3, 1996, p. 7.
   Dole backs removal of software export ban
   By Louise Kehoe in San Francisco
   Senator Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican presidential
   candidate, yesterday threw his support behind proposed
   legislation to remove US export restrictions on computer
   software used to encode Internet messages.
   The new Security and Freedom through Encryption bill
   introduced yesterday by several Republican senators and
   congressmen, also rejects a controversial Clinton
   administration proposal to enable law enforcement agencies
   to unlock encoded electronic messages.
   For Senator Dole, the encryption bill provides an
   opportunity to seek support from Silicon Valley high-tech
   leaders many of whom backed Mr Bill Clinton in 1992, and to
   boost his election campaign efforts in California.
   "The administration's misguided proposal on encryption
   amounts to a pair of cement shoes for Silicon Valley," said
   Senator Dole. "It seems to me that a new pair of track
   shoes might be a better answer. The administration's big
   brother proposal will literally destroy America's computer
   industry," he said.
   Encryption software is currently classified as "munitions"
   and exports are strictly limited by the US state
   department. US and other western intelligence and law
   enforcement agencies are opposed to the commercial use of
   the most powerful encryption methods which they argue could
   be used to mask criminal or terrorist activities by
   effectively preventing wire-taps.
   However, US software companies maintain that the current
   export restrictions threaten US pre-eminence in the world
   software market.
   A study by the Computer Systems Policy Project, a computer
   industry group, estimated that within four years the US
   economy would lose $60bn in revenues and roughly 216,000
   jobs as a result of encryption export controls.
   Moreover, current regulations, which allow export only of
   "weak" encryption, are unacceptable because such encoding
   has been demonstrated to be ineffective.
   Last year, for example students in France were able to
   break encryption which is used in the export version of
   Netscape Communication's popular Internet browser software.
   The limited availability of strong encryption software is
   also blocking the progress of electronic commerce on the
   Internet, US computer experts argue, because companies and
   individuals are reluctant to make electronic payments over
   the Internet without assurance of security.

      The CIA is already upgrading many of its techniques:
      breaking into computer systems, intercepting faxes,
      experimenting with dead drops in cyberspace to receive
      secrets.
      The big-ticket spending that is out of control has been
      satellites. The CIA wants to build $1 billion-apiece
      "8X" spy satellites to photograph targets, even though
      it has sitting in warehouses about half a dozen
      satellites that have the capacity to take pictures for
      the next decade. But satellites may simply not be that
      useful. A secret CIA study recently concluded that
      satellites provide less than 10% of the valuable signal
      intelligence collected from such rogue states as Iraq
      and Iran. Most such data are scooped up by ground
      stations or via phone taps.
      There is deep anxiety at Langley that Deutch's grab for

Two related    articles which examine c'punks interests -- proposed    business regulation of the Net; on-line security;    copyright; encryption; authentication; E-cash; electronic    commerce; protected communities to escape "frontier    anarchy."    Executive summaries by HBR:    "Ruling the Net." Debora Spar and Jeffrey J. Bussgang    The Internet promises a radical new world of business. But    for many companies, it has yet to deliver. Although doing    business in cyberspace may be novel and exhilarating, it    can also be frustrating, confusing, and even unprofitable.    Debora Spar and Jeffrey Bussgang argue that the problems    companies face have little to do with a lack of technology    or imagination. Their problems stem instead from a lack of    rules. Without the order that rules create, business cannot    be conducted.    The authors explain why the informal rules that have    developed on the Internet since the 1960s are no longer    sufficient. Businesses thinking of allowing millions of    dollars of transactions to occur on the wide-open Net need    specific assurances. They require clear definitions of    property rights, a safe and useful means of exchange, and    a way to locate and punish violators of on-line rules.    The authors believe that the key to commerce on the    Internet lies in the creation of managed on-line    communities. Such communities can be formed by service    providers -- entities that will restrict on-line options,    fine-tune offerings to match a select group of users, and    provide some means of recourse in cases of fraud or abuse.    Under those conditions, they will draw new companies    on-line and increase the productivity of those already    there. And, say the authors, the rewards for service    providers will be substantial: Companies that make the    rules on the Internet's emerging frontier have the    opportunity to reap the greatest profits.

Arthur Armstrong    and John Hagel III    The notion of community has been at the heart of the    Internet since its early days, when scientists used it to    share data, collaborate on research, and exchange messages.    But how can businesses best use its community-building    capabilities? Not merely by putting their products or    services on-line, the authors contend. Real value will come    from providing people with the ability to interact with one    another -- from satisfying their multiple social needs as    well as their commercial needs. Companies that create    strong on-line communities will command customer loyalty to    a degree hitherto undreamed of and, consequently, will    generate strong economic returns.    The authors present four different types of community:    communities of transaction, interest, fantasy, and    relationship. Examples of each type already can be found on    the Internet or through on-line services, but the    successful community of the future will incorporate all    four -- or as many as possible. As for economic value, the    authors see four ways for a company to generate returns:    through usage fees, content fees, transactions and    advertising, and synergies with other parts of its    business.    In the near future, new business definitions may emerge    around the notion of owning a specific customer segment    across the full range of its interests and needs; owning    specific products and services may no longer be so    important.

@_subject: NYT on Netscape Flaw 
The New York Times, May 18, 1996, pp. 31, 43.    New Netscape Software Flaw Is Discovered    By John Markoff    Computer science researchers at Princeton University said    yesterday that they had discovered a new and potentially    serious flaw in the Netscape Communicatlons Corporation's    Navigator software, the leading program used to browse the    World Wide Web of the Internet.    The flaw, which was found in recent versions of the    Netscape software that support Sun Microsystems' Java    programming language, could allow people to write    destructive or malicious programs and potentially destroy    or steal data or otherwise tamper with a computer that was    connected to the Internet and used the Navigator program.    Netscape executives said that the researchers had been in    touch with them about the problem on Thursday and that the    software company was in the process of producing a new    version of the Navigator program that would protect against    potential attacks.    This is the third flaw in the Navigator program discovered    in recent months by the Princeton group. Netscape has been    under tremendous scrutiny over the security of its popular    software since the fall, when a group of researchers at the    University of California at Berkeley discovered a flaw in    the Netscape security system.    In the most recent case, Thomas Cargill, an independent    software consultant working with the Princeton group,    discovered a problem in the way Netscape has used the Java    language in its Navigator program. The group disclosed a    similar flaw in March in the Netscape Navigator that would    permit a Java program to run illicitly on a computer that    was running the Netscape program and perform damaging    operations.    "Netscape has fixed a series of problems, and the overall    security of their system has improved, but there is still    some reason for concern," said Prof. Edward Felton, the    leader of the Princeton group, which includes two graduate    students, Drew Dean and Dean Wallach.    Programs that are known as viruses and worms are a serious    threat to computer networks because they can move from    machine to machine quickly, carrying out destructive    applications. Sun Microsystems' Java language has been    designed to limit what a virus can do once it is    transferred across the Internet. But the security    mechanisms only work if the virus's code can be restricted    in a safety "box" constructed out of software.    Netscape's executives acknowledged yesterday that the    Princeton University team had on both occasions been able    to find doors that let program code out of the safety box.    "We're trying to create a sandbox which has rooms where    only certain things happen," said Jeff Trehaft, Netscape's    director of security. "What happened is that the Princeton    team found a door and it turned out that there weren't    adequate protections surrounding the door."    The company said it was in the process of posting on the    Internet a new version of the most recent test version of    its next-generation Internet program, version 3.0 beta. The    program contains a special fix to prevent the new attack.    He said Netscape had not yet posted a fix for the most    recent commercial release of its software, version 2.02,    but was instead encouraging customers to use the 3.0 beta    software.    Since the Berkeley researchers discovered the first    security flaw the company has offered a $1,000 "bugs    bounty" to programmers who are able to locate security    flaws.    [End]

Spies Without Cloaks: The KGB's Successors    By Amy Knight    Princeton University Press. 318 pp. $24.95       Knight suggests that Russia's new security forces are       not only continuing the same kinds of skulduggery as       they undertook in the past but are now also expertly       manipulating public opinion in Russia and the rest of       the world to obscure and disguise what they do.       What Knight suggests is that the old client-master       relationship between Russia's elite and the KGB has not       only been reversed but may even have vanished, because       these "children of the KGB" have subsumed large chunks       of Russia's economy and government.       If *Spies Without Cloaks* is correct, much of Russia       today is little more than a mutant KGB, the communist       ideology it once served now replaced by ruthless       devotion to great-power politics and bottom-line       capitalism.    The book is worth reading for its applicability to the    transformation of the US and international intelligence    "communities" into free-market racketeering of espionage    technologies and expertise and insider secrets -- as WaPo    reported May 2 on high-tech intel patrons Perry and Deutch.

It presents a vision and course of action for developing a cryptographic infrastructure that will protect valuable information on national and international networks.      The draft paper is the result of the many discussions we have had with interested parties concerning the use of encryption. While those discussions have explored the use of both key recoverable encryption and non-recoverable encryption, the draft paper addresses an infrastructure which uses key recoverable encryption. We believe such a key management infrastructure, voluntary and supported by *private sector* key management organizations, is the prospect of the near future. It would permit users and manufacturers free choice of encryption algorithm, facilitate international interoperability, preserve law enforcement access, and, most importantly, provide strong system security and integrity.      Recognizing that a robust infrastructure is not yet a reality, we are also considering measures to liberalize export policy for some non-escrowed products. Appendix II of the draft paper begins to summarize current policy, and we intend to expand and improve that section.      We believe that clearly articulating such a vision will accelerate the ability of the United States to realize the full advantages of the global network for commerce, security and public safety. However, such a vision cannot become a reality unless it is widely shared. Therefore, rather than being a finished product, the attached paper is a draft which we ask you to help us improve. We hope it will contribute to constructive discussion and promote a clearer understanding of each others' needs and concerns regarding the use of encryption.      We welcome your comments and look forward to further discussion. Written comments may be sent to our attention, Room 10236, NEOB, Washington, D.C. 20503. ____________________________________________________________

subject    Several news reports in the last few days seem to be aiming    at raising the alarm about crypto, perhaps in response to    the various crypto bills, administration reformulations,    and studies such as that headed by Herb Lin.    The recycling of the news of DoD break-ins supposedly due    to heavy military reliance on the Internet; the drumbeat of    conferences, press releases and planted stories on    international money laundering, the hazards of E-money to    the stability of the banking system, spreading "Russian"    criminality, and the role of high-technology in each; global    Chinese arms dealers and copyright pirates; thousands of    Japanese spies needed to combat "Asian" threats.    These scares might well be orchestrated in support of    Clipper 3 -- to the mutual benefit of international     governments and commerce as stated by the IWGCP report.    The Clipper 3 report, as John Gilmore and others have    noted, aims at an international clampdown on non-GAKed    crypto. For this to work, all the major crypto players must    agree to act at the same time so that no one gets an    advantage by offering non-GAKed products.    But is it not probable that there will be a holdout    nation(s), like the Swiss in war and bank secrecy, to offer    crypto that is non-GAKed? Or will a holdout be starved?    Or is it more likely that the genuine alternative to    multilateral governmental regulation is going to be small-    scale, non-corporate, private parties, insusceptible to    large-sacle governmental-market coercion, willing to offer    risky, covert services, perhaps as lucrative as prohibited    armaments?    In such a case, for example, would not a highly skilled    cryptographer, let us call her Mathilda Blaze, be able to    sell covert crypto (on the side, encrypted transactions,    anonymity assured) for far greater reward than a not-very-    secure pittance and pension at a downsizing ATT, or NSA, or    Russia, China, Israel, France, UK, NL, JP ... ?    To be sure, if we knew what they knew, we would understand    why the House has just increased the intelligence budget to    $30bn, $2bn more than 1996 (WaPo 5-23-96).    Maybe all the major crypto nations (gov-and-com), are    minting E-money to pay their best techies to protect their    secrets. If so, may the best algorithmist take 'em all to    the cleaners -- just remember to share with the hackers    spooking the spooks-and-crooks of gov-com intel-insec,    and causing "Yo, man's" of recognition and admiration of     those peering for pennies at ELINT and NetSec screens.

Follow-up to Peter Wayner's post yesterday:    The New York Times, May 24, 1996, p. D8.    American Banknote Gets Into Pachinko    The American Banknote Corporation said yesterday that it    was developing optical-reading technology for a group of    Japanese companies to help prevent counterfeit prepaid    cards in the pachinko business.    Pachinko, which is similar to pinball, is played in some    18,000 parlors in Japan and has grown in popularity in the    last few years.    Morris Weissman, American Banknote's chairman, said    American Banknote's holographics unit was making cash-value    cards and machines to read them. The cards and machines    will be tested in Japan in July, and "if certain criteria    are met," more will be installed in August, he said.    He said cards would authorize a person to play a game of    pachinko and win money. The cards, he said had "specific    algorithms and codes we believe are almost impossible to    duplicate."    -----

New Sci 25 May 1996:    "Panning for data gold."       Nowadays nearly every organization from supermarkets to       the police can boast a vast mine of electronic data.       Separating the gold from the dross is the real       challenge. A growing band of computer scientists say       they can dig out nuggets of 24-carat knowledge from huge       mountains of database dross. They call themselves "data       miners", and they are wielding some pretty impressive       tools -- information theory, laws of probability,        neural networks, tree induction, genetic algoritms,        disjunctive normal form logic.       But the impact of their efforts is anything but esoteric.       By identifying potential new customers -- or ways of       hanging on to existing ones -- this information is worth       millions in extra revenue. And this is just the start,       according to Usama Fayyad of Microsoft Research and       co-editor of a new book on data mining.    MIN_ers

New Sci 25 May 1996:    "Forensic lab awash with Semtex."       Just 5 nanograms of RDX -- one of the ingredients in       Semtex -- is enough to link a suspected terrorist to a       bombing. Yet the DERA forensic laboratory that carries       out tests in many high-profile terrorist cases       frequently finds more than this on its floor. "It's       horrifying," says an independent forensic scientist        who specialises in explosives cases. "They seem to        have been getting contamination all the time."       In contrast, forensic experts frequently say that the       Forensic Science Agency in Northern Ireland has the most       thorough precautions against contamination. The agency       moved to a new laboratory in 1992 after the IRA blew up       its old one.    SEM_tex

The achievement not only sheds light on the paradox of       Schrodinger's cat but could also have important       consequences for cryptography, a science that creates       codes to safeguard the electronic transfer of money,       state secrets and other valuable things.

21+C, Scanning the Future (UK), February, 1996:    "Dataveillance."    A global trend is emerging toward citizen surveillance.    While authorities speak of the need for data regulation and    people become digital shadows, watchdogs are doing some    monitoring of their won. With interviews of Phil Agre,    Roger Clarke and Simon Davies on invasive and privacy    technology.       These technologies face an uphill public relations       battle. Digital cash has already been widely accused of       providing money launderers, drug barons and other       criminals with the perfect means of continuing their       activities. It's the same argument that was used in the       Clipper Chip debate, in which the US government proposed       a central encryption software, and it will no doubt be       directed towards pseudonymous techniques as they emerge.       Simon Davies is familiar with this type of argument. He       says there has been a change of political winds in       recent years. Where once privacy was used to protect       individual freedoms it is now officially deemed by       governments and corporations to be an aid to criminals       and a barrier to administrative efficiency. "In a       generation, we now have privacy as almost like an       ancient forgotten wisdom," he says. Then he adds: "The       point that needs to be made very clear is that       technology has been misused. It always did have the       capacity, the capability to be a friend to people.       Instead, it has become a potential tool of enslavement.       And it has rendered society vulnerable on a scale that       has never been seen before. It is technologists and       politicians and financiers who have misused the       technology and should be brought to account for it."    UNV_eil

FiTi:    Chips Galore [Editorial]    Texas Instruments' claim to have developed a technology    capable of inscribing 125m transistors, or computing    elements, on a thumbnail-sized slice of silicon is    remarkable chiefly because the technique is commonplace.    ...    The consequences for society of this continued rise in    complexity are perhaps not fully grasped even in an age in    which computers are taken for granted. The latest    technology promises ubiquitous, tiny packages of electronic    intelligence. Today's model is the smart card and the tiny    videocamera. Tomorrow, tiny processors will be embedded in    jewellery, spectacles, buildings and furniture. ...    Widely distributed computer power will confer substantial    advantages on society; but it will create new ethical    problems for society, such as the individual's right to    privacy, which may be at least as difficult to master as    the technology.    -----    FiTi reported yesterday and today on TI's new chip:    TIC_hip

The New York Times, May 31, 1996, p. D2.    White House Challenged on Data Security    By John Markoff    The United States Government should immediately relax    export controls on electronic data coding products and    allow the computer, software and telecommunications    industries to set data security standards, a new report    urged yesterday.    The report, commissioned by Congress and prepared for the    National Research Council of the National Academy of    Sciences, stands in direct opposition to existing Clinton    Administration proposals for data security standards and    for linking the relaxation of export controls to the    adoption of such standards. The report calls for the    widespread commercial adoption of technologies used to    prevent illegal wiretapping of computer data, telephone,    cellular and other wireless communications. The National    Research Council provides science and technology advice    under a Congressional charter.    The report also states that despite creating potential    problems for law enforcement agencies by making it easier    for criminals to shield their communications from    Government wiretappers, cryptography would also help    prevent crime by sheltering communications and electronic    transactions from the prying eyes of electronic    interlopers.    "Without information security, computer crime in this    country will rise very rapidly," said Kenneth W. Dam, the    chairman of the panel that prepared the report. Mr. Dam,    Deputy Secretary of State during the Reagan Administration,    is also professor of American and foreign law at the    University of Chicago.    The report, industry executives said, is likely to become    a key weapon in the battle between the Federal Government    and industry and civil liberties groups.    "It echoes things we have been saying for some time," said    Jim Bidzos, chief executive of RSA Data Security Inc., a    developer of computer security software. "The next    battleground is going to be Capitol Hill because the    Administration isn't going to give up easily."    In particular, the report takes issue with Administration    efforts to force the use of data-scrambling systems using    "escrowed" keys that would let law enforcement and    intelligence agencies use built-in backdoors to read coded    information.    Cryptography, once used only by spies and the military, has    become an increasingly vital technology for insuring    security in electronic commerce and personal privacy. It    relies on the use of mathematical formulas to scramble    electronic information so that it cannot be read without    the proper digital "key."    Key escrow systems like those proposed by the    Administration in its Clipper chip program would split the    key and have trusted third parties like the Treasury    Department hold parts of it, making it possible for law    enforcement agencies to generate keys without consulting    the sources of the data.    As recently as two weeks ago, the Administration was    pushing for key escrow coding approaches to data    scrambling. A draft White.House policy paper has proposed    linking relaxation of export controls to systems that    included key escrowing. The recent paper also indicated    that the Government was willing to accept "self-escrow"    systems for some large corporations that would allow them    to to hold all parts of the keys.    Critics of key escrow management technology note that it    can be abused by agencies that wish to exceed their    surveillance authority and that the technology is    vulnerable to a single point of failure. If a so-called    master key is stolen, they say, the entire coding system    can be compromised.    Because strong cryptography would complicate the mission of    United States intelligence agencies, the Federal Government    currently places tight controls on the export of software    and hardware that offer stronger cryptographic protection    than 40-bit keys. Such keys are made up of a binary number    that is 40 digits long. Computer experts have shown that    40-bit keys are vulnerable to attacks.    The report released yesterday, "Cryptography's Role in    Securing the Information Society," calls for dropping stiff    export controls on products that use the Data Encryption    Standard, which relies on a 56-bit key and offers stronger    protection against computerized attacks than a 40-bit key.

Netscape (WSJ) and PRZ (Globe) say the NRC crypto    export recommendations don't go far enough.    ----------    Wall Street Journal, May 31, 1996, p. B5.    U.S. Strategy Should Promote Computer Codes       Panel Says a Free Market Is Best Policy, Urges Easing of       Export Curbs    By John J. Fialka    Washington -- The federal government should promote rather    than discourage widespread commercial use of powerful codes    that can protect electronic communications, a panel    sponsored by the National Research Council recommended.    The government also should relax its export controls on    such codes, according to the 16-member panel, which    included a mix of business, academic and government    experts. The NRC is an affiliate of the National Academy of    Sciences, a private, nonprofit organization that advises    the government on scientific matters.    Encryption coding software scrambles computer data by using    mathematical formulas that can't be read if intercepted.    Only personnel with the correct "keys" can access the data.    More Study Needed    The NRC study, which took 18 months to complete, calls for    greater trust in freemarket demands for protection and less    reliance on the U.S. National Security Agency and the    Federal Bureau of Investigation to set the nation's code    policy. It said the two agencies' recent promotion of    "escrowed encryption," in which the government would hold    a mathematical key to unlock codes, requires further study    because it poses liability risks and introduces weakness    into information protection systems.    Kenneth W. Dam, a University of Chicago law professor who    headed the panel, said changes are needed to counter "an    explosion of computer-based crime" and other forms of    espionage that threaten U.S. companies' ability to protect    proprietary information, especially overseas.    By promoting the use of more-elaborate codes, U.S.    law-enforcement agencies would be better prepared to ward    off hacker or terrorist attacks on the nation's electric    power grid, banking and telecommunications systems and its    air-traffic control networks, he added.    Potential Problems    Mr Dam said the widespread use of encryption by private    business is "inevitable" and the government must "recognize    this changing reality."    The report noted that the FBI has argued for years that its    law-enforcement efforts would be hampered if drug cartels    and other organized criminals began using codes that    couldn't be deciphered. Courtordered wiretaps, a major tool    used to break organized-crime cases, could become useless,    the FBI has contended.    Edward Schmults, general counsel for GTE Corp. and a former    deputy attorney general during the Reagan administration,    said he and other panel members believe the FBI and other    law-enforcement agencies would be helped more than hurt if    legitimate businesses were better protected. "It's a    balancing issue," he said.    Spokesmen for the FBI and NSA referred questions to the    White House, where an official said the Clinton    administration disagrees with the panel's recommendation to    relax export controls and wants to continue to explore the    use of escrows by private industry to keep the keys to    powerful codes. "We have equities to protect that the    people who wrote the NRC report do not," he said.    The administration, he said, still wants to review the    export of more powerful codes on a case-by-case basis. The    use of private, third-party escrows, he said, might be one    way to protect the secrecy of companies while allowing    federal agents with court orders access to code keys.    New Markets Would Open    The panel called for the U.S. to permit the export of codes    containing a "56-bit" Data Encryption Standard algorithm.    The algorithm, or formula, was developed by the National    Bureau of Standards in 1975 and is 65,000 times tougher to    break than current "40-bit" codes that are permitted for    unlicensed exports.    The panel estimated its recommendations would open up new    markets for information security products, possibly    increasing software-industry revenue "many tens of billions    of dollars." Until now, export controls tended to set    industry standards for a level of protection because    companies were reluctant to use different systems for    domestic and international applications.    Jeffrey Treuhaft, director of security at Internet software    giant Netscape Communications Corp., welcomed the report,    but said exports shouldn't be limited to 56-bit keys. That    would still blunt the competitive edge of U.S. software    vendors, given that code-cracking computer power is    multiplying, he said.    "The U.S. has a lead right now and these arcane policies    from the Cold War are giving U.S. industry cement shoes to    compete with foreign competitors," Mr. Treuhaft said. "We    can't run as fast as they ean."    - Jared Sandberg in New York contributed to this article.    [End] ----------    The Boston Globe, May 31, 1996, p. 36    Panel criticizes US government's encryption stand       'Net, cell phone security at stake, National Research       Center says    By Hiawatha Bray    The Clinton administration's efforts to limit the sale of    software that generates coded messages, already unfire from    Congress and civil libertarians, is now facing criticism    from a committee of the National Academy Sciences.    The National Research Center, which gives science and    technology advice under a congressional charter, yesterday    said the government should promote the commercial use of    encryption software to help cut down on the theft of    computer data and other electronic communications.    Law enforcement officials and intelligence agencies are    worried about the development of cheap encryption grams,    for fear it could become impossible to intercept a    mobster's telephone call or read an enemy spy's electronic    mail messages.    But the center's report says that encryption software is    essential for businesses and individuals who need to    transmit confidential data using the Internet or cellular    telephones.    "On balance, the advantages of more widespread use of    cryptography outweigh the disadvantages," the report says.    Encrypted messages can easily be read by someone with the    correct code "key." Without this key, it can take centuries    of computer analysis to decode a message. The longer the    key, the tougher it is to break the code.    Under current federal law, US companies cannot export    encryption programs that use keys longer than 40 bits.    Computer experts say that 40-bit encryption systems are    easy to break, and provide little security.    As a result, many software companies that sell their    products worldwide do not build in sophisticated encryption    features. Industry experts say that this costs them    millions of dollars in sales, as customers in foreign    countries buy encryption software made outside the United    States.    The report urges a change in the federal law, to allow sale    of an encryption system called DES that uses 56-bit keys.    "Except in some very specialized situations, it gives    adequate security," said council chairman Kenneth Dam, a    law professor at the University of Chicago.    The report also urges the administration to abandon efforts    to force businesses and individuals to use "key escrowed"    encryption software. Under this plan, companies could use    encryption, keys of any length, but only if the keys were    held in escrow, and could be made available to the    government.    The council urges the federal government to adopt key    escrow to prove that the system is trustworthy. The report    argues that many businesses will voluntarily adopt such a    plan to guard against the loss of its encryption keys.    A prominent critic of encryption policy was less than    thrilled by-the council report. "It doesn't go far enough,"    said Philip Zimmermann, inventor of the Pretty Good Privacy    encryption program.    Zimmermann scoffed at the idea that DES encryption is    secure enough for use by businesses. "It can be broken in    seconds by the NSA [National Security Agency]," Zimmermann    said. "All major governments can break DES. In fact, any    Fortune 500 company can afford a machine that can break    DES."    But even if DES were secure enough, Zimmermann said he    opposes any restrictions on the export of encryption    software.    [End]

This is the article Winn Schwartau cited to last night: ----------    The Sunday Times (London), June 2, 1996, pp. 1, 24.    City surrenders to L400m gangs [Insight column]    City of London financial institutions have paid huge sums    to international gangs of sophisticated "cyber terrorists"    who have amassed up to L400m worldwide by threatening to    wipe out computer systems.    Banks, broking firms and investment houses in America have    also secretly paid ransom to prevent costly computer    meltdown and a collapse in confidence among their    customers, according to sources in Whitehall and    Washington.    An Insight investigation has established that British and    American agencies are examining more than 40 "attacks" on    financial institutions in London and New York since 1993.    Victims have paid up to L13m a time after the blackmailers    demonstrated their ability to bnng trading to a halt using    advanced "information warfare" techniques learnt from the    military.    According to the American National Security Agency (NSA),    they have penetrated computer systems using "logic bombs"    (coded devices that can be remotely detonated),    electromagnetic pulses and "high emission radio frequency    guns", which blow a devastating electronic "wind" through    a computer system.    They have also left encrypted threats at the highest    security levels, reading: "Now do you believe we can    destroy your computers?"    The authorities have been unable to stem the attacks, which    are thought to onginate from the United States. In most    cases, victim banks have failed to notify the police. "They    have given in to blackmail rather than risk a collapse in    confidence in their security systems," said a security    director at one blue-chip merchant bank in the City.    A senior detective in the City of London police said: "We    are aware of the extortion methods, but the banking    community has ways of dealing with it and rarely reports to    the police."    European and American police forces have set up special    units to tackle the cyber criminals, who, Ministry of    Defence sources believe, have netted between L200m and    L400m globally over the past three years. But law    enforcement agencies complain that senior financiers have    closed ranks and are hindering inquiries.    Experts in the field of information warfare met in Brussels    last month to discuss defensive measures. Representatives    included Captain Patrick Tyrrell, assistant director of    computer information strategy at the Ministry of Defence;    General James McCarthy, professor of national security at    the US Air Force Academy; General Jean Pichot-Duclos,    director of the economic intelligence department of the    French Defence Council, and senior figures from the    civilian computer industries.    A separate closed meeting involving representatives from    Whitehall and the intelligence community was held to    analyse the 40 attacks on British and American financial    centres since 1993. A further secret seminar took place in    Washington this weekend.    Kroll Associates, the international investigating firm,    confirmed last week that it had acted for financial    institutions that have been blackmailed. "One of the    problems we face is that the potential embarrassment from    loss of face is very senous," said a spokesman in New York.    Kroll had evidence that firms in London and New York had    been targeted. "The problem for law enforcement is that the    crime is carried out globally, but law enforcement stops at    the frontier," he said.    Yesterday a Bank of England spokesman acknowleged the    threat from the extortionists: "We are aware of this. It    does exist. It is extortion and fraud." But the spokesman    also insisted: "It is not the biggest issue in the banking    market."    Scotland Yard is now taking part in a Europe-wide    initiative to catch the cyber criminals and has appointed    a senior detective from its computer crime unit to take    part in an operation codenamed Lathe Gambit. Such is the    secrecy that few details about the inquiry have emerged.    In America, the FBI has set up three separate units to    investigate computer extortion.    The NSA believes there are four cyber gangs and has    evidence that at least one is based in Russia. The agency    is now examining four examples of blackmail said to have    occurred in London:    + January 6, 1993: Trading halted at a broking house after    blackmail threat and computer crash. Ransom of L10m paid to    account in Zurich.    + January 14, 1993: a blue-chip bank paid L12.5m after    blackmail threats.    + January 29, 1993: a broking house paid L10m in ransom    after similar threats.    + March 17, 1995: a defence firm paid L10m in ransom.    In all four incidents, the gangs made threats to senior    directors and demonstrated that they had the capacity to    crash a computer system. Each victim conceded to the    blackmailers' demands within hours and tranferred the money    to offshore bank accounts, from which it was removed by the    gangs within minutes.    The techniques have varied. In London, criminals posing as    marketing firms have gained detailed knowledge of a    target's system by interviewing the heads of information    technology departments. In some cases, they have even    issued questionnaires to unsuspecting officials. Armed with    this information, they have been able to breach security    and leave encrypted messages warning of their capability.    The gangs are believed to have gained expertise in    information warfare techniques from the American military,    which is developing "weapons" that can disable or destroy    computer hardware. Some are also known to have infiltrated    banks simply by placing saboteurs on their payroll as    temporary staff.    Little is yet known about the identities of the gangs but,    according to the NSA, America is the main source of the    attacks. It believes that at least one other group    originates from Russia and has followed the movement of    money to the former Soviet states.    A spokesman for the Metropoiitan poiice said: "There is    potential for extortion from those purporting to know how    to damage computer systems.    "The computer crime unit liaises where necessary with its    Euro counterparts to discuss cross-frontier crimes."    One merchant bank director said yesterday: "You will never    get a financial institution to admit it has an extortion    policy, let alone that it has paid money to blackmailers."    -----    Additional reporting: Peter Warren    [End]

@_subject: NRC Session Hiss 
During the Q&A of the NRC public session, it was asked why    56-bit DES was selected as the standard of export over    other widely distributed programs such as PGP.    The panelists seemed to me uneasy in answering this.    Primarily their view was that DES was "ubquitious," well-    known and tested by use.    However, when pressed by later questioners on this topic,    they expanded their view: that if another, stronger,    program became "ubiquitous" -- in wide use -- they would    support it as the standard of export. When it was pointed    out that PGP now fit this definition, the panel merely    repeated the statement about ubiquity without specifically    affirming or denying the PGP claim. Their poker faces    seemed uniformly in place to dampen a potential    inflammatory topic.    Perhaps other attendees will amplify this odd demeanor, but    it seems to me that the panel was attempting to avoid    commenting one way or the other on PGP's worldwide ubiquity    for unstated reasons.    I wonder if this was a nudge to the audience that the    informal spread of unapproved encryption is the best way to    establish its ubiquity and thereby to set a new standard    for export, sort of under the noses of the authorities --    as if PGP was exemplary.    Recall that this fits the Clinton administration's way of    getting around the Croatian arms embargo -- the "no    position" position of sidestepping legality.    Also, I wonder if the panel wants avoid an open conflict    with the administration, the LEAs and the security agencies    about PGP. (Or do they know something about PGP that we    don't know, or have been led to think they do?)    Peter Neumann had pointed out earlier that crypto was going    to be ubiquitous, and fairly soon, no matter what. He noted    that it is the NRC's recommendation that LEAs take the    "long-term, pro-active" view about this and get on with    developing other technologies, and training personnel in    them, to fight computer crime -- like traffic analysis,    packet trace, etc. -- and to accept that prohibiting and    cracking crypto is not effective. (This may have been    diversionary, but he seemed sincere.)    Perhaps the panel is agreeing the crypto genie is out of    the bottle, and are advising the authorities to recognize    that stronger and stronger crypto is going to become    ubiquitous, and it's time to move on to other, presumably    less ubiquitious, cyber-crime fighting technolgies.    Perhaps the committee was briefed on these technolgies, or    maybe some members are even developing them -- Mr. Neumann,    for example, in conjunction with Ms. Denning, et al.    Those who plan to attend the June 6 session might want to    pursue the "no position" position about PGP's ubiquity, and    why. Diversionary sop, say, to cover the promotion of non-    crypto invasion of privacy.    Further, it would be helpful to learn more about what the    the committee members were told about "long-term" cyber-    surveillance technologies in the pipeline.    What bothered me more than anything else about the session    was that individual privacy got such short shrift by    panelists and by the audience.  While there was a bit of    discussion on personal privacy protection, government and    business, and their mutual back-scratching, seemed to the    the primary focus.    Pretty Lousy Privacy appears to be in the works, judging    from what was not disclosed in the session (and in the    report) about two 800-pounders working in concert at    citizen data gathering, mining, selling, controlling,    dominating -- at the expense of individual privacy, and,    shout it, liberty.    Peter Neumann got to me when he described the "downside" of    anonymity, encryption and security: how can we know who are    the criminals if we don't for sure who is who and know for    sure who is doing what? Not a single panelist disagreed    with his statement about this, but then I heard only a few    snorts from the criminal-fraught-fed audience.    I kept mum. Jesus, who knows who was recording every    titter and hiss -- besides anonymous beside me and me.

Tomorrow, the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of       Consumer Protection is sponsoring a public workshop in       Washington called "Consumer Privacy on the Global       Information Infrastructure." The F.T.C.'s intention is       to find out how much consumers and the industry really       know about critical privacy issues created by what it       calls "the emerging on-line marketplace," and to look at       various ways to protect personal data.       Privacy on data networks is a complex issue. It includes       thorny questions about anonymity -- who should be       allowed to be anonymous in network interactions, and       under what circumstances -- and the red-hot debate over       digital encryption, which can protect private       communication and transactions from all prying eyes,       including the Government's.

Newsweek, June 10, 1996, pp. 49-55.    Scared Bitless       The arcane world of cryptography used to be the       exclusive realm of spies. Now it's everybody's business       -- to the chagrin of the government.    By Steven Levy       [Photo] Loosen up: Sen. Conrad Burns says the United       States should ease the export rules on crypto software    On the face of it, the issue of cryptography -- the    technology that employs secret codes to protect information    -- seems more suited to math class than "The McLaughlin    Group." Yet this once esoteric subject has wound up in the    center of a Beltway controversy, complete with    congressional infighting, lobbyists, entrenched government    agencies, blue-ribbon reports and even a bit of    presidential politics. This sudden spotlight on what was    previously the domain of deep-black spy stuff turns out to    be a good thing, because in the Information Age crypto    policy is more than an abstraction: it could provide the    difference between security and vulnerability, or even    between life and death. Unfortunately, choosing the right    policy is not a given, and there the controversy lies.    Here's the problem: we're increasingly entrusting    information to computers -- everything from confidential    medical records to business plans to money itself. But how    can we provide security so that these data will be    protected from eavesdroppers, thieves and saboteurs? The    answer hinges on cryptography. By scrambling the    information into digital codes, it allows only those    entrusted with the keys to decipher those files to see    them. Some hot-shot cryptographers have developed systems    that can provide all of us with unprecedented security,    automatically coding and decoding in such a way that we    won't have to know it's there. (We can even have our phone    calls encoded something Prince Charles might have    appreciated.) Silicon Valley would love to set such a    system in motion. It not only would generate revenues, but    would also address the main problem that's keeping the    Internet from fulfilling its potential as a center of    commerce: security.    Problem solved? Not quite. Law-enforcement and    national-security agencies view this prospect with dread.    Legal eavesdroppers, like FBI wiretappers and National    Security Agency snoopers, couldn't make sense of    intercepted transmissions. They warn that we could miss    indications of a terrorist act, like a nuke smuggled into    Manhattan. In addition, drug dealers, child pornographers    and garden-variety thugs could mask their activities with    a mere mouse click.    Even before the Clinton administration took office, the NSA    and FBI presented those nightmare scenarios to the    transition team. The Clintonites were scared bitless. They    vowed to make sure that the worst didn't happen. They    understood that cryptography should be put to general use    -- but only if it were altered in such a way that the    government could, if necessary, get access to secret    messages, using a new technology known as "key escrow." The    best-known of those schemes was the ill-fated Clipper Chip,    and subsequent systems haven't caught on. (Yet another was    presented two weeks ago.) Until then they would maintain    the strict export controls that treat crypto software as    powerful munitions. That's right -- Uncle Sam regards that    copy of Netscape you downloaded as sort of a Stinger    missile.    But now the government position of slowing down the flow of    crypto is under increasing attack. Software companies    complain that regulations cost them money and hold down    innovation. Privacy groups complain that the controls reek    of Orwell's "1984." Congress is demanding changes. Bob Dole    wants to make it an issue. And on Thursday came what Sen.    Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican, called "the nail in the    coffin" of the Clinton crypto policy: a report by the    National Research Council that clearly rebukes the    administration's position. Despite the Clinton-Gore attempt    to protect us against the abuse of cryptography, says the    Congress-commissioned report, our safety is at risk --    because the lack of cryptography has weakened our security.    Under particular attack are the regulations that limit the    strength of exported software like IBM's Lotus Notes,    mostly by mandating that the keys that encode and decipher    the information not exceed 40 bits (the longer the key, the    stronger the protection). Often, domestic users have to    settle for this crippled crypto: since software companies    are loath to release two versions of their products, they    simply choose to offer the weaker, approved-for-export    version.    Meanwhile, foreign companies have no such restrictions, and    U.S. companies maintain they are losing sales. Congress has    taken up their case; bills introduced by Sen. Patrick    Leahy, Rep. Bob Goodlatte and Burns all would relax the    export rules. "These bills are pro-privacy, pro-jobs and    pro-business," says Leahy. While prospects for passage are    slim, the fact that a sizable number of legislators are    defying intelligence and law-enforcement agencies is itself    significant.    Crypto policy is even finding its way into the presidential    campaign. On a visit to Silicon Valley, Bob Dole was    alerted to the problem by Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale. He    also saw a chance to chip away at Clinton's support in the    high-tech world. Dole not only cosponsored the Senate bills    but issued a neo-cypherpunk statement charging that "the    administration's big brother proposal will literally    destroy America's computer industry."    The NRC report, entitled "Cryptography's Role in Securing    the Information Society," stands as the most serious    challenge to current policy. It is drenched in credibility:    its 16 authors include former attorney general Benjamin    Civiletti, onetime NSA deputy director Ann Caracristi,    privacy expert Willis Ware and cryptographer Martin    Hellman. The panel was briefed by all sides of the issue,    including some classified sessions with government    officials. Despite the group's diversity, it reached    consensus: "Widespread commercial and private use of    cryptography is inevitable in the long run and ... its    advantages, on balance, outweigh its disadvantages."    The NRC made some specific recommendations. The government    should stop building a system around the umproven    Clipper-style technology. The export regulations should be    relaxed, specifically permitting free export of the    well-tested Data Encryption Standard, which uses a 56-bit    key. (While some argue for even bigger keys, this is a    significant jump. The increase in key size alone means that    theoretically it will be more than 65,000 times harder to    crack a code.) Perhaps the strongest rebuke came with the    rejection of the "if you only knew" defense. The committee    concluded that informed decisions on crypto could be made    without access to classified material.    If the NRC advice was followed, would criminals hide    nefarious activities behind a digital wall of gibberish?    Quite possibly, admits the committee -- but without action    to promote crypto, we are increasingly dependent on a    computer-controlled world with insufficient protection.    "We're encouraging a world that supports greater    confidentiality -- but we think it's worth the risk," says    panelist Ray Ozzie, creator of IBM's Lotus Notes. The    committee cited security breaches like the recent raid on    Citicorp by Russian hackers, and warned that without    crypto, we are more vulnerable to "information warfare"    threats -- endangering operations like the    air-traffic-control system.    The government's response? "We do care about the security    of information, but we need to do it in a way that does not    diminish law enforcement," says an administration official.    "People writing academic reports can take chances. But when    you are the policeman, you have to err on the side of    protecting people."    The question is, which approach provides the most    protection? The NRC report undercuts the government's    position at a time when many were already beginning to    question it. On May 21, 11 senators sat down in a bugproof    room for a classified briefing, presumably designed to make    them rethink their proposals. But, said Leahy, "no one    seemed to change their mind." Looks like they've cracked    the code.    [Two photos] 'Pro-privacy, pro-jobs, pro-business': Sen.

Connecting Declan's three dots [...]:    The New York Times, June 4, 1996, pp. D1, D4.    Japanese Chips May Scramble U.S. Export Ban    By John Markoff    Washington, June 3 -- The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone    Corporation has quietly begun selling a powerful data-    scrambling chip set that is likely to undermine the Clinton    Administration's efforts to restrict the export of the    fundamental technology for protecting secrets and commerce    in the information age.    The existence of the two-chip set, which will have broad    potential application for local computer networks, the    Internet and telephone switching networks, was disclosed    here in a speech today at a public policy workshop by the    chief executive of RSA Data Security, a Silicon    Valley-based company that has frequently dueled with the    Administration over its export-control policies.    The executive, Jim Bidzos, said that his company was    negotiating with N.T.T., the giant telecommunications    concern, to resell the chips in the United States. Mr.    Bidzos also said that N.T.T. had already made sales in 15    countries, including in the United States to I.B.M.    "N.T.T. has done a lot of research and development work on    this product" he said. "There is clearly going to be a lot    of demand for their chips."    An executive at NTT America said that although there were    no restrictions on the export of cryptographic hardware or    software from Japan, his company was still anxious to    obtain software from RSA Data to use in its chips. That    software is still controlled by United States export law,    he said.    "We'd like to use this technology," said Junichi Kishigami,    director of NTT America, which is based in Mountain View,    Calif. "It is important to employ good international    standards."    Mr. Bidzos has been a vocal and longtime opponent of United    States export laws that prohibit the sale, without a    special license, of products that have powerful    data-scrambling capabilities. The Government's policy is    directed at limiting the spread of systems that could make    it more difficult for American intelligence and    law-enforcement agencies to conduct electronic    surveillance.    Such restrictions have been bitterly opposed in recent    years by American computer and telecommunications    companies; they have argued that the technology is already    widely available internationally and that manufacturers and    software developers in the United States are in danger of    losing markets to foreign competitors. The N.T.T.    technology would seem to support those contentions.    "The United States export controls are at risk from    Japanese competition," said Stewart Baker, a Washington    lawyer who is the former general counsel for the National    Security Agency.    The N.T.T. device also underscores fundamental differences    that exist between Japan and the United States on the issue    of privacy in the information age.    While United States officials have struggled to maintain    their ability to conduct electronic surveillance, Article    21 of Japan's Constitution specifically forbids    wiretapping.    "It's very interesting that the Japanese regard for privacy    in their Constitution translates into better cryptographic    technology," said Marc Rotenberg, director of the    Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington public    policy group and an organizer of today's workshop on data    scrambling.    Mr. Bidzos said that N.T.T.'s chips, which have been    developed and manufactured by a subsidiary, N.T.T.    Electronic Labs, were far more powerful than the so-called    Clipper chip, a data-scrambling system that the Clinton    Administration proposed for the nation's telephone system.    While the Clipper system has a built-in "back door"    intended to permit the F.B.I. to gain wiretap information,    the N.T.T. system has no such surveillance feature, It also    uses much stronger data-encryption algorithms than United    States export laws permit.    Those laws restrict the export of encryption systems which    employ digital "keys" of more than 40 bits in length. The    new N.T.T chips, however, are based on the United States    data encryption standard, which has a 56-bit key, and    actually triples the strength of that standard. Such a    scrambling system is believed to be beyond the capability    of the most powerful code-breaking system.    In addition to the "private" key system for scrambling    data, N.T.T. uses RSA Data's "public" key method to permit    computer users who have not previously exchanged    information to swap-private key information safely. The    N.T.T. system uses the RSA Data key, which is 1,024 bits in    length, also far stronger than the United States export    regulations permit.    "If there is anyone in the Government who hasn't already    seen the writing on the wall, here it is," Mr. Bidzos said.    He said that RSA Data had set up a small subsidiary in    Japan last year and that he was now negotiating with N.T.T.    to make a minority investment in that subsidiary in    exchange for N.T.T.'s gaining access to the RSA Data public    key technology.    The N.T.T. technology is at least partly the result of an    initiative by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and    Industry, which 18 months ago made a $120 million national    commitment to develop products to facilitate electronic    commerce.    "This is a major business opportunity that the Japanese see    clearly," said Deborah Hurley, an official at the    Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the    Paris-based international group.    RSA Data was acquired in April by Security Dynamics    Technologies Inc., a computer security company based in    Cambridge, Mass., in a stock deal valued at $250 million.    Mr. Bidzos said that the two companies had continued to    operate relatively independently.    [End]

@_subject: (Fwd) Crypto conference 
I was at EPIC's annual crypto conference yesterday, and just thought I'd pass along my impressions. It was, as always, extremely interesting; EPIC does a terrific job at these things of getting a very diverse and
thoughtful collection of people with interests in crypto policy into the room
together, everyone from Whit Diffie and Phil Zimmermann and Eric Hughes to Scott Charney of DOJ and Bruce McConnell of the White House, people from the OECD
and the hardware/software community, etc. There were panels on key escrow, digital cash, international developments, and the Karn/Bernstein cases and other domestic policy developments.  To
me, the most striking feature of the event was what I felt was a new bite to
the complaints about export controls.  People have been complaining, needless
to say, about these for a while -- but the *economic* case for lifting
controls is now in the forefront of the discussion in a way that was not the case before, imho.  Indeed, there wasn't an enormous amount of talk about the *privacy* implications of encryption this time at all.  Jim Bidzos of RSA gave a very powerful talk at lunch, at which he unveiled two chips that are
now being mass produced by Nippon Telephone, one incorporating the Triple-DES algorithm, and one with the RSA public key algorithm.  Someone else pointed to a recent story in the Economist, which listed the leading encryption software/services companies worldwide, each of which is Israeli.
Bidzos made the claim, and many others echoed, that the export controls are
in the process of doing nothing more than ceding a potentially lucrative market to others, a market in which the US might otherwise be expected to
be the dominant player.  It may even, in the eyes of some, be too late to undo
this damage. Now, some of this may be exaggerated, special interest whining.  But there's an interesting hook here.  Many have talked about the importance of
control over "standards " in network industries, the importance of
obtaining an early dominant position in the market that can appropriate all of the network externalities waiting to be plucked out there.  [Mark Lemley has an
interesting discussion of this in a piece on antitrust on the Net -- Mark, is that out anywhere yet?]  Acting quickly to penetrate the market becomes critical, not just because markets change on "Internet Time," but also because the early entrants have a chance of establishing themselves as de facto standards and thereby extending their dominance over time.  This, one
can plausibly argue, is what is happening -- has happened? -- in this market.  It is more credible in these kinds of markets to argue, as Bidzos was arguing, that if government policymakers wait until there's actual evidence of damage, of "lost market share," to US companies, that it will
at that point already be too late to do anything about the damage. ---------- [Second Cyberia-L message by David Post] One other interesting issue generated heated discussion -- as in yelling
and screaming between audience and panel -- at the EPIC conference.  Scott Charney of DOJ, who heads the US delegation to the OECD crypto guidelines conference, was subjected to pretty heated questioning about the
possibility that the US is trying to use the international forum as a way to move a particular policy agenda that is *not* being successfully peddled at home, and then to use the international support as a means of moving the domestic
policy debate in that direction.  Jamie Boyle of AU was particularly eloquent about this concern (I raised it too, less eloquently) -- I think
it fair to say that both of us had the copyright experience in the back of our
minds, where, many of us believe, the US has been pushing the "Lehman agenda" in international discussions as a way of presenting Congress with a
kind of fait accompli.  Charney vigorously denied that this was going on --
he strongly argued that since the OECD guidelines are non-binding (unlike, say, the treaty obligations being discussed in the copyright context), there's simply nothing wrong with discussing these clearly global issues with our international partners. It was, as they say in the press, a spirited exchange. David ********************************* David G.

USA Today, June 5, 1996, p. 1.    Feds ready anti-terror cyberteam    By M.J. Zuckerman    The Clinton administration, citing the threat of electronic    terrorist attacks, is taking steps to secure cyberspace.    The administration is expected to announce later this month    formation of:    + An emergency response task force, directed by the FBI and    based in the Justice Department, to manage any terrorist    incident involving an attack in cyberspace.    The Cyber Security Assurance Group would funcaon as both an    emergency response team and investigative body. It will    respond to any collapse of the National Information    Infrastructure -- the nation's vital computer systems such    as banking, transportation and telecommunications.    "The threat is there, it's very real," says CIA General    Counsel Jeffrey Smith. "If we have a Unabomber who decides    to launch an attack with a PC instead of a bomb, (there    could be) a great deal of damage."    + A commission, dominated by national security    representatives and chaired by a private sector person, to    deliver within 12 months a national policy on cyberspace    security.    The commission faces difficulty in balancing government    inter-agency turf battles as well as dealing with industry    and the private sector, which oppose Internet regulation.    "This is one of the toughest issues government faces    today," says Smith.    The initiatives have emerged from an unprecedented, closely    guarded series of meeangs held in recent months between    leading administration officials from law enforcement,    national security and defense.    Attorney General Janet Reno, acting under a classified    presidential directive issued late last year in response to    the Oklahoma City bombing, chairs the panel.    It includes the directors of the CIA and FBI along with    Cabinet secretaries from Treasury, Commerce, Transportation    and Energy.    Today, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations    holds the second in a series of hearings examining    cyberspace security and threats to information systems.    The panel's minority staff is expected to endorse    administration proposals to clearly draw national policy on    information security but calls for a more ambitious    emergency response effort by government.

The Economist, June 8, 1996, p. 65.    Encryption    Silence of the bugs    Spare a thought for America's professional snoops. For    decades the FBI and others have counted the telephone    wiretap among their favourite weapons against crime, as    countless mafiosi can (and did) testify. Now, software in    a computer or digital telephone can scramble a message so    effectively that no law-enforcement agency can read it. For    years, the government has fought back by restricting the    use of encryption, to the fury of privacy advocates on the    Internet, where rampant eavesdropping makes encryption    essential. Now a bit of silicon and a stack of paper have    apparently ended the battle: the cops lost.    The bit of silicon is actually two chips that can encrypt    data transmissions so that they are in effect uncrackable.    Had the chips been developed in the United States, the    government would have classified them as "munitions" and    banned their export. But they were developed in Japan, by    NTT, the telephone giant, and the Japanese subsidiary of    RSA, an American encryption company, which revealed their    existence early this week. They can therefore be used    around the world, and even imported into the United States.    There seems nothing the American government can do about    it.    As if that were not bad enough, America's restrictive    encryption policy took another hit last week when a report,    commissioned by Congress and compiled by the prestigious    National Research Council (NRC), concluded that the policy    had hurt Americans far more than it had helped them. For    the past few years, the White House has been offering a    purported compromise: give the government (or a mutually    trusted third party) a key to read your encrypted e-mail,    and you can scramble it all you like. The problem with this    so-called "key escrow" proposal was that it smacked to many    of Big Brotherism. The computer industry rejected it out of    hand, and fell back instead on weaker encryption that was    not regulated, even though this can be cracked over a    weekend with a home PC.    Up to now, the government's response to cries for better    encryption for all has been to fall back on its    responsibility to protect the citizenry. The NRC panel    rejected this, together with the "if only you knew what we    know" argument the government has usually trotted out.    Composed of former security officials and encryption    experts, this panel did know what the government knows, and    was still not convinced.    Now the NTT chips seem to sweep away the whole debate. NTT    has already sold the chips in 15 countries, and they should    soon be incorporated in products. Stewart Baker, the former    general counsel of America's National Security Agency,    concedes that the chips have probably killed encryption    controls in America, but argues that the battle will    continue to run in Europe, where countries such as France    limit their use. For the rest of the world, these bits of    silicon may indeed make it harder for police to protect    citizens. But they will also make it easier for citizens to    protect themselves.    --

The article Winn Schwartau cited today and a related column: ----------    The Sunday Times (London), June 9, 1996, p. 1/8    Secret DTI inquiry into cyber terror [Insight Column]    The government has been holding a secret investigation into    attacks by "cyber terrorists" on the City of London for    more than two years. The Department of Trade and Industry    (DTI), Bank of England, GCHQ, the secret listening station,    and the Defence Research Agency (DRA) are involved in the    inquiry.    The existence of the investigation, which began in April    1994, emerged after The Sunday Times revealed last week    that banks, broking firms and investment houses had paid    millions of pounds to gangs that threaten to wipe out    computer systems.    Correspondence from the investigating authorities, seen by    Insight, include letters from civil servants saying they    are "extremely concerned" at the evidence of extortion    demands.    Yesterday the DTI issued a statement confirming the inquiry    and suggesting its work had been hampered by the lack of    co-operation from City institutions.    "We are very interested in the allegations of extortion    directed at City of London institutions which were brought    to our attention in 1994. We responded then by involving    many government organisations, including the DTI, the    police, the Bank of England and other agencies. So far, we    have not been presented with any hard evidence from    victims. We would urge those threatened to come forward,"    a spokesman said.    In one letter, dated May 1995, David Hendon, director of    DTI technical affairs, wrote to a company specialising in    computer security work stating that he was taking the City    extortion issue "extremely seriously". Insight has since    seen the evidence passed to the DTI and GCHQ which sparked    the investigation. In 1994, a consultant working for a    company which undertakes computer risk assessments for City    institutions compiled a table of 46 attacks on banks and    finance houses in New York, London and other centres,    starting in January 1993.    The list included details of raids on three British banks    and one American investment house. The documents suggested    that operations in the futures markets had been a focus for    some of the attacks.    Documents sent by the DRA, from the office of Professor    David Parks, a senior director, indicate that the agency is    especially interested in the "weaponry" deployed by the    cyber terrorists.    The agency believes high-intensity radio frequency (HIRF)    guns may have been used to black out trading positions in    City finance houses. The weapon disables a computer by    firing electromagnetic radiation at it and is a "black    programme" at the defence ministry, one of the highest    security classification levels.    Last December, Parks approached a company which specialises    in defensive measures against information warfare and    carries out work for GCHQ. For a L30,000 fee it was asked    to arrange a demonstration of a portable HIRF weapon in    Germany.    Details of the HIRF weaponry and its use in the City have    also been compiled by Computing magazine, which intends to    pass them to the DTI and other authorities.    [End] ----------    [Related column, p. 2/4]    Held to ransom by superhighway-men    Private Account [Column]    By Jeff Randall    Forget Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the world's    financial institutions have a new type of bank robber to    deal with -- the cyber terrorist.    Before you start thinking it sounds like science fiction,    consider this: the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)    this weekend confirmed there is an official investigation    into "raids" by gangs of computer experts who threaten to    wipe out electronic information and trading systems, unless    they are paid off.    The DTI spoke out after last weekend's scoop by the Sunday    Times' Insight team revealing that some of London's best-    known institutions have paid huge ransoms to "electronic    highwaymen" to prevent the meltdown of computer networks.    These revelations have sent a shiver up the spines of the    City's top banks. Financiers are terrified the emergence of    a gaping hole in their systems will cause a loss of    investor and customer confidence -- and rightly so.    Can you imagine calling your stockbroker to buy a few    thousand ICI shares, only to be told its entire information    bank had been blown away by a Dick Turpin with a PhD in    electronic engineering?    If, like me, you know nothing about computer technology,    and care even less, the temptation is to dismiss the    problem as the creation of Arthur C Clarke. But the DTI has    acknowledged for the first time that an investigation into    these "attacks" has been under way for two years. The Bank    of England and GCHQ, the government's secret listening    station, are working alongside the DTI in the inquiry.    Agencies in Britain and America believe there have been    more than 40 raids on investment firms in New York, London    and other European financial centres since 1993. Victims    are understood to have paid up to L13m a time after    blackmailers showed their ability to bring electronic    trading in shares, bonds and commodities to a halt.    Futures-market systems have been a favoured target of the    space-age bandits. In some cases, the blackmailers have    used technology developed by military scientists.    But here is the paradox: the DTI has been hampered by the    reluctance of City firms involved to co-operate.    Extortionists have so frightened the investment houses,    they fear reprisals if they are discovered helping official    agencies track down the gangs. There is also concern that    an admission of the threats would diminish confidence in    the banking system and create a loss of face for the    victims. A banker told Insight: "You will never get a    financial institution to admit it has an extortion policy,    let alone that it has paid money."    That begs the question: who in London has paid up? Insight    has been told of at least four blue-chip firms caving in to    extortionists. For the time being, we have agreed to keep    certain information confidential to preserve the integrity    of the institutions while the agencies investigate. But the    names will eventually surface, and then there will be some    serious explaining to do.    [End]

The New York Times, June 10, 1996, p. A10.    The New Encryption Universe [Editorial]    The development of inexpensive computer programs and    hardware that scramble telephone calls and computer    messages to prevent eavesdropping is rapidly transforming    the world of cryptography. Once largely the domain of    governments and their intelligence services, encryption    technology is now commonly used by corporations, banks,    securities firms and individual computer operators. It is    time to revise Government encryption policy to fit this new    universe.    A panel of the National Research Council makes a convincing    case for doing just that after a careful review of    encryption issues. The panel calls on the Government to    abandon its effort to limit the development and    availability of advanced encryption technology. The Clinton    Administration has fought to preserve the Government's    ability to access commercial and individual communications    for law enforcement purposes by encouraging adoption of a    single encryption standard that Government agencies could    track and decipher if needed.    The Research Council panel leans the other way, urging the    commercial development of powerful encryption software even    though it would make wiretapping more difficult. It also    recommends that Washington ease restrictions on exports of    encryption technology.    The Government has long framed the debate over commercial    encryption around its need to fight crime through    wiretapping. The panel recognizes the usefulness of    court-authorized wiretaps. But the panel suggests that a    more important issue is the ability of the private sector    to transfer confidential financial and other data over    telecommunications pathways without interception.    The Clinton Administration wants the private sector to    adopt a type of encryption technology, known as key escrow,    that would give the Government the ability to unscramble    private phone or computer messages with court authorization    and thereby preserve its wiretap capability. But the policy    has so far failed several practical tests. The private    sector has not voluntarily adopted a Government-controlled    technology. In addition, encryption programs are already    available that allow almost anyone with a computer and    modem to work around Government-controlled technology. One    sophisticated system would allow two strangers -- people    who had swapped no private passwords -- to read each    other's encoded messages.    It seems likely that the Administration approach will not    succeed. If so, the danger is that Washington might move to    outlaw encryption technology it has not approved, a step    that would grossly violate American civil liberties. The    best way for the Government to protect its ability to    eavesdrop on domestic and foreign criminals is to stay    technically ahead of them. The panel recommends vigorous    Government research programs to that end.    The Research Council group would permit American computer    companies to export more powerful encryption software than    currently permitted. Foreigners already have access to    encryption systems that are more powerful than those    American companies are allowed to sell. The export    restrictions do nothing to keep encryption software out of    the hands of criminals and hostile governments, but    needlessly drive American exports out of foreign markets.    The panel's conclusions are especially credible because its    membership was not tilted against the Government. The    16-member panel was led by Kenneth Dam, a former Deputy    Secretary of State, and included Benjamin Civiletti, a    former Attorney General, and Ann Caracristi, a former    deputy director of the National Security Agency. The    Clinton Administration should take notice. It needs a new    encryption policy.    --

The Washington Post, June 10, 1996, p. A18.    Global Village Cops?    What will be the long-term effect of Internet technologies    on global law enforcement? The amazing story of Bill and    Anna Young, a k a Leslie Rogge and Judy Kay Wilson, offers    one possible scenario. The pseudonymous Youngs, residents    of Guatemala who the FBI says have been on a decade-long    run from U.S. justice since Mr. Rogge was convicted of a    string of bank robberies and other offenses, turned    themselves in to authorities after a neighbor recognized    Mr. Rogge's face on the FBI home page's Most Wanted list.    According to a story first told in the Guatemala Weekly,    the person who recognized him was a newly Internet-wired    14-year-old.    The vision of the future evoked by this story, of a world    in which the familiar "global village" becomes a place not    just of instant communication but of neighborly nosiness    and where no one can just melt into the crowd, is    reassuring and unnerving in about equal proportions. (What    if it were a network of hit men or an authoritarian    government seeking a dissident, rather than the FBI, making    use of this powerful technology?) But it's also worth    keeping in mind that, other than the romance of the    technology, it doesn't represent that great an advance on    current global media that have made celebrities or    fugitives' faces familiar to a vast public -- just ask    Salman Rushdie. The Rogge nabbing is the first that the FBI    credits to its home page specifically, but TV's "America's    Most Wanted" has scored similar coups.    The impossibility of predicting the exact shape of these    extensions of policing is relevant as well to a report that    the National Research Council recently issued on another    computer technology issue -- the vexed matter of whether to    ease export controls on encryption software, which encodes    information sent electronically so that only a user with a    key can decipher it.    The government until now has resisted lifting controls on    "uncrackable" encryption software --  that is, codes that    are too complex to be broken by brute force -- unless the    industry agrees to deposit keys in an escrow arrangement    with a third party so the government can seek and obtain a    warrant to read encoded communications if necessary.    Software makers, meanwhile, are pushing hard to have these    restrictions eased. The research council, an arm of the    generally neutral National Academy of Sciences, sought to    bridge the gap between industry interests and such    government agencies as the FBI and national security    agencies, whose case, they say, is based largely on    classified matter that can't be publicly discussed.    Part of the report's conclusion, which favors the easing    though not the abolition of current restrictions, is that    wider use of encryption technology will actually *help*    national security and law enforcement because more data,    economic and otherwise, will be secure to begin with. But    if the news of the changing terrain tells anything, it is    that it is far too soon to base arguments on such a    premise. Our own sense on encryption is that the national    security and law enforcement questions remain too important    to be sacrificed lightly, despite the considerable economic    interests of the parties on the other side. But the world    of Internet law enforcement is still taking shape. Whatever    the public conclusion on encryption, the debate should not    rest on any assumptions about what that shape will be.    --

6-11-96. FiTi:    "US squares up to cyberterrorists."       Until recently, the concept of "information warfare" has       been widely dismissed as alarmist rhetoric and viewed as       "post Cold War hysteria" generated by those with an       interest in maintaining the vast US intelligence       apparatus. But the potential use of computer networks to       undermine public confidence, disrupt essential services,       play havoc with the economy or damage military       capabilities is now being taken seriously in Washington.       Encryption may be just one of many battlegrounds --       others include: proposals for mandatory reporting of       corporate computer intrusions and for exceptions to US       laws that prohibit intelligence agencies from snooping       on domestic communications; the forthcoming ruling by US       courts on free speech on the Internet, in response to       laws aimed at stopping distribution of pornographic       material; and possible limits on information that       marketers may gather and use about children who surf the       Internet.

Foreign Policy, Summer 1996:    "Information Age Intelligence." by Bruce D. Berkowitz,    a former CIA analyst and staff member for the Senate    Intelllgence Committee. Excerpts of 14-page essay:       During most of this century, the intelligence       community led the world in developing information       technology. Intelligence organizations were deeply       involved in the development of telegraph and       telephone networks, modern computers, and       space-based communications and surveillance       systems. The intelligence community also       established new forms of analysis and areas of       expertise.       Yet several signs suggest that the intelligence       community is no longer the leader in the       information world, and it may have fallen behind       significantly in some respects. The underlying       problem is that the intelligence community has       failed to keep up with changes in how modern       society uses information and how information       technology develops in modern society. As a       result, our model for intelligence is out-of-date.       This reality is what current efforts at       intelligence reform are failing to recognize.       The intelligence community needs to move as fast       as information businesses do to capture markets,       but the traditional organization is not up to the       task. Today's model for intelligence -- how it is       organized and how it operates -- is an artifact       from an earlier age. Even the name "Central       Intelligence Agency" is reminiscent of the New       Deal era, when large, powerful, national       bureaucracies were the accepted way of getting       things done efficiently. It makes less sense in a       world moving toward fluid, distributed, networked       information organizations.       As the capabilities of the private sector improve,       the intelligence community will need to move on to       the next frontier of technology or expertise that       the private sector has yet to fill. While one       challenge for intelligence reform is to keep up       with these changes, fundamentally the greater       challenge will be to establish an organization       that can adapt with the times.       One reason why the intelligence community cannot       deal effectively with the Information Revolution       is that intelligence requirements and the       intelligence community's comparative advantage are       both fluid, but the traditional intelligence       bureaucracy remains static. In addition,       organizations responsible for developing and       applying technology, such as the National       Reconnaissance Office (NRC)) and the National       Security Agency (NSA), have created organizational       dogma, and dogma always resist change. Once such       organizations carve out a place for themselves       (and their technologies) in the budget, they can       be difficult to dislodge. The fact that these       organizations often operate at a classified level       further insulates them. As a result, the       intelligence community often locks into specific       technologies, even when new and possibly better       ideas have come along.     ----- Our Web site was hosed clean today, so this article may not survive.

Summary    The Government recognises the importance of the development    of the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) with respect    to the continuing competitiveness of UK companies. Its aim    is to facilitate the development of electronic commerce by    the introduction of measures which recognise the growing    demand for encryption services to safeguard the integrity    and confidentiality of electronic information transmitted    on public telecommunications networks.    2.  The policy, which has been decided upon after detailed    discussion between Government Departments, involves the    licensing and regulation of Trusted Third Parties    (hereafter called TTPs) which will provide a range of    information security services to their clients, whether    they are corporate users or individual citizens. The    provision of such information security services will be    welcomed by IT users, and will considerably facilitate the    establishment of, and industry's participation in, the GII,     where trust in the security of communication has been    acknowledged to be of paramount importance. The licensing    policy will aim to preserve the ability of the intelligence    and law enforcement agencies to fight serious crime and    terrorism by establishing procedures for disclosure to them    of encryption keys, under safeguards similar to those which    already exist for warranted interception under the    Interception of Communications Act.      3.  The Government intends to bring forward proposals for    legislation following consultation by the Department of    Trade and Industry on detailed policy proposals.

6-15-96. NYP Mag:    "Dead as a Dollar."       For everyone who uses cash, everyone who stores it and       everyone who regulates it, a challenge is nearing. The       challenge will be to make choices. Some kinds of       electronic currency will protect privacy, and some will       violate privacy. Some will make crime easier, and some       will make it extraordinarily difficult. Some will tax       commerce parasitically, and some will catalyze it. The       new minters of money will have enormous power to choose       -- unless consumers, on the one hand, and Government       officials, on the other, decide to make their own       choices.       In the "current climate," as those in Washington tend to       say, anything that smacks of an expanded role for the       Government is anathema. Policy makers at the Treasury       are reluctant even to talk about electronic money on the       record. "It's easy to go in and say, 'Oh, we're going to       regulate everything,' without knowing what everything       is," says a senior Treasury official. "We want to know       what everything is." He adds: "There are very serious       policy issues -- seigniorage, money laundering,       financial- stability issues, consumer issues that are       genuinely important that we must address and look hard       at. It may be sensible for the Government to issue a       card -- that's conceivable -- but what if you issue it       and nobody uses it?"       As money enters a new age, so does counterfeiting. The       ultimate threat is the perfect copy -- the virtual coin       that proves mathematically identical to the real thing.       If money is a string of bits, then someone, some where,       can make a perfect copy, and another and another. An       arms race is already raging between those working to       armor-plate digital cash with doubly and triply secure       cryptography and those working to pierce the armor.       Security experts assume that nefarious characters, in       search of an unending stream of money, are already       investing millions in the next stages of research and       development.       For every new idea in tamper resistance, there is a new       idea in tampering.... "At least you can cause people to       have to spend a lot of money," says Eric Hughes, a       cryptography expert. "But doing the second chip is far,       far less money than the first. And if you could make a       master chip that spoke the right protocol, you could       make a little money mint for yourself."       "Information warfare is going to make people very       worried downstream," says Crook at Citicorp. "We have an       immense paranoia about how dangerous it's going to be.       I think that the security requirements in our industry       are going to be more severe than at the Department of       Defense."       Cryptography is as close as modern mathematics comes to       magic.       It's simply a design choice. Smart cards, or their       on-line equivalents, could function as blindly as raw       cash. They could be even less traceable than in Chaum's       system. That is a frightening prospect to law-       enforcement authorities. Having finally made life       difficult for drug smugglers with heavy cash suitcases,       they will not casually allow the manufacture of half-       ounce chips that could make possible blind transfers of       hundreds of millions of dollars, a money launderer's       dream. Even if the Government takes no other action in       the electronic-money arena, it will surely move to       extend its restrictions on cash to cover digital       equivalents. And so far, the large institutions entering       the electronic-money arena are leaning toward       less-anonymous, less-private approaches than Chaum's,       betting that most of us will be willing to sacrifice       more pieces of privacy for, say, convenience. Chaum       could prove right, but only if the marketplace is       willing to cast its votes for privacy.

@_subject: Trits 
As a complement to Jim Choate's forward on the "trits"    communication research, we suggest perusing an interview of    the philosopher Paul Virilio. Here're are excerpts from the    interview available at:           PAUL VIRILIO: I have to take a detour through physics here,    and this is one of the differences between and Baudrillard    and myself. Unlike him, I have a formal scientific    education (that's why physics and military sciences kept me    busy for a very long time). In the past, reality was a    matter of mass; then it became mass + force. Today, reality    is the outcome of: mass + force + information. Matter has    now become truly three-dimensional. This is a clear break.    What we have witnessed in Italy, with Berlusconi seizing    power, is the first successful media-coup in history. Italy    is again Europe's avant-garde, and is showing us where the    new political alternative resides - in a realm where "left"    or "right" are no longer relevant. The new political    alternative is between the old political class on one side,    and the new media-class on the other. With Italy, the    media-class has now seized power in Europe. It will also    happen in the United States, in France, in Spain, and    elsewhere.    CARLOS OLIVEIRA: Do you see some kind of media-fascism    looming on the horizon?    PAUL VIRILIO: No, because what I see is far worse! Due to    its overwhelming power, the totalitarianism of the    information-medium is going to be even more powerful than    the traditional political totalitarianism of the old    national-socialist or communist hues.

For background on the recent cyber-terrorists reports from    London, we offer the Council on Foreign Relations' 1995    report:                       NON-LETHAL TECHNOLOGIES                  Military Options and Implications                 Report of an Independent Task Force    The long history of military operations has been marked by    steady increases in the lethality of weapons. U.S.    commanders and policymakers face excruciating dilemmas in    decisions to use lethal force. They strive to maximize    protection of their own troops and to minimize collateral    casualties among noncombatants. Authoritarian regimes -- as    in Iraq -- and factions in civil wars -- as in Bosnia --    may see fear of American casualties as one factor in    deterring intervention against them. Terrorists, guerillas,    and other irregular forces often exploit noncombatant    populations by mounting attacks from their midst.    Can technology, ease these dilemmas by providing    acceptable, effective non-lethal capabilities to supplement    conventional weapons across a broad spectrum of conflict?    In major wars or similiar cases of high-level violence, can    such capabilities reduce the risk to U.S. forces by, in    effect, substituting technology for manpower in performing    certain missions, for example, by shutting off power    transmission and communications of adversaries? In    situations short of traditional warfare -- for example, the    humanitarian intervention in Somalia -- can non-lethal    systems help provide calibrated coercion proportional to    the objectives? How do they relate to the lethal systems on    which U.S. forces depend? What policy issues do such    technologies pose? In this report a bipartisan task force,    including former Air Force and Army chiefs of staff,    leading scientists, and other experts, examines these    questions. The task force concludes that a number of    non-lethal technologies deserve serious consideration in    U.S. planning and development for future military    contingencies.

@_subject: The Rise of the Virtual State 
Foreign Affairs, July/August, 1996.    "The Rise of the Virtual State" [Excerpts]       Richard Rosecrance, UCLA Professor of Political Science    Amid the supposed clamor of contending cultures and    civilizations, a new reality is emerging. The nation-state    is becoming a tighter, more vigorous unit capable of    sustaining the pressures of worldwide competition.    Developed states are putting aside military, political, and    territorial ambitions as they struggle not for cultural    dominance but for a greater share of world output.    Countries are not uniting as civilizations and girding for    conflict with one another. Instead, they are downsizing --    in function if not in geographic form. Today and for the    foreseeable future, the only international civilization    worthy of the name is the governing economic culture of the    world market.    Timeworn methods of augmenting national power and wealth    are no longer effective. Like the headquarters of a virtual    corporation, the virtual state determines overall strategy    and invests in its people rather than amassing expensive    production capacity. It contracts out other functions to    states that specialize in or need them. Imperial Great     Britain may have been the model for the nineteenth century,    but Hong Kong will be the model for the 21st.    As a result of these trends, the world may increasingly    become divided into "head" and "body" nations, or nations    representing some combination of those two functions.    The world is embarked on a progressive emancipation from    land as a determinant of production and power.    Diminishing their command of real estate and productive    assets, nations are downsizing, in functional if not in    geographic terms. Small nations have attained peak    efficiency and competitiveness, and even large nations have    begun to think small. If durable access to assets elsewhere    can be assured, the need to physically possess them    diminishes.    The virtual state is an agile entity operating in twin    jurisdictions: abroad and at home. It is as prepared to    mine gains overseas as in the domestic economy. But in    large countries, internationalization operates    differentially. Political and economic decision-makers have    begun to recast their horizons, but middle managers and    workers lag behind. They expect too much and give and learn    too little. That is why the dawn of the virtual state must    also be the sunrise of international education and    training. The virtual state cannot satisfy all its    citizens. The possibility of commanding economic power in    the sense of effective state control has greatly declined.    Displaced workers and businesspeople must be willing to    look abroad for opportunities. In the United States, they    can do this only if American education prepares the way.    ----------       (39 kb)    VST_ate

New Scientist, 22 July 1996, p. 10.    Crackdown on Net Crooks 'a charter for state snoopers'    Britain and France have become the first European nations    to take concerted action against swindlers and other    criminals operating on the Internet. The governments of    both countries last week announced plans to license Trusted    Third Parties (TTPs) to act as "honest brokers" for online    business transactions. But civil liberties campaigners fear    that the schemes may be snoopers' charters, giving police    forces and security agencies unprecedented opportunities to    spy on the world of business.    The idea is for TTPs to act as "introduction agencies" that    will reassure each party to a deal that the other has been    vetted and is reputable. TTPs will also hand out encryption    software that business partners will use to exchange    information in confidence. But in both countries, TTPs will    be required to release the keys to this encryption to the    police or the security services, on production of an    appropriate warrant.    Currently there are few safeguards to protect those    contemplating buying goods or services over the Internet    from fraudsters. "Cyberspace has become the new frontier    for scam artists," concluded a report released by the US    Federal Trade Commission last month. "The scams are not new    but the medium is."    John Moroney, a senior consultant at the computer    consultancy Ovum, believes TTPs are the best way to drive    forward the growth of business over the Internet. As online    transactions become commonplace, he argues, banks may be    especially keen to volunteer as TTPs, to protect their    dominance in the financial services market. "If home    shopping takes off they could be left exposed," says    Moroney.    But Simon Davies, director of the London-based civil    liberties watchdog, Privacy International calls the plan    "naive". He argues that businesses are perfectly capable of    setting up secure systems for electronic trade without    government involvement: "What is the government doing in    this field in the first place?" The British and French    proposals, Davies says, bear a strong resemblance to the    failed "Clipper chip" plan in the US.    The Clipper scheme involved building a scrambling chip into    all new telephones and computers. The keys to the scrambler    would have been in the hands of government-appointed    agencies. "With Clipper it quickly became clear the agenda    was broader than initially stated," says Davies, "and that    is exactly what will happen in Europe." He fears that if    the scheme takes off, companies not using TTP-approved    encryption software will instantly come under surveillance    by the police or security services.    The Department of Trade and Industry in Britain rejects    this claim. "The government licensing of TTPs is just a way    of enhancing consumer confidence," says a spokesman, who    adds that there are no plans to ban non-TTP software.    Banks, trade associations and telecommunications firms are    the most likely candidates for becoming TTPs, the DTI says.    -- Mark Ward    [End]

The Washington Post, June 25, 1996.    Domain Delinquents Get Day's Reprieve       Firm Delays Suspension of Internet Service to Process       Flood of Fees    By David S. Hilzenrath    The Herndon company that assigns the basic addresses on the    Internet said yesterday it would delay until this evening    a plan to cut off the service of address holders who    haven't paid the required fees.    Network Solutions Inc., which registers addresses under an    arrangement with the federal government, had planned to cut    off the delinquents yesterday, but postponed the action as    it processed a flood of last-minute payments.    The cutoffs involve about 10,000 of 400,000 "domain" names    -- the portion of the Internet address that follows the "    symbol -- whose holders have not paid Network Solutions a    $100 registration fee.    Network Solutions spokesman David Gravff said the company    would suspend service for those domain holders that had not    paid by 5 p.m. on Sunday. The service of those who pay    between that time and tonight will be suspended, but the    company will soon reinstate it. The cutoff involves domain    holders that registered their addresses between Sept. 14,    when Network Solutions began charging new users, and Feb.    28.    Domain names may be held by companies, universities,    individuals, government agencies or other organizations,    and a single domain name might be used by many people.    People using domain names that are suspended would not be    able to receive electronic mail. Similarly, people would    not be able to connect to World Wide Web sites using    suspended domains.    The company two weeks ago estimated that 25,000 domain    names would be suspended, but it reduced the total as    last-minute payments arrived.    The company will wait 60 days before reissuing the    suspended domain names to new users, giving delinquent    users another chance to pay and reclaim them, Graves said.    -----    For More Information: Is your domain name available?

The New York Times, June 26, 1996, p. B7.    Head of C.I.A. Plans Center To Protect Federal Computers    By Tim Weiner    Washington, June 25 -- Alarmed at the growing threat that    computer hackers pose to national security, the Director of    Central Intelligence today announced plans to create a    "cyberwar" center to protect the bits and bytes that weave    the nation together.    The United States cannot be brought to its knees by a    madman with a modem. But the Director, John M. Deutch, said    the nation's intelligence agencies were alert to the threat    of "very, very large" attacks on the computers that run    Defense Department war rooms, power plants, telephone    systems, air traffic control centers and international    financial transfers.    "The electron," Mr. Deutch warned, "is the ultimate    precision-guided weapon."    Mr. Deutch said he was seeking to create a cyberwar center    at the National Security Agency, the giant electronic    eavesdropping branch of American intelligence. He said the    center could focus the Government's previously scattershot    efforts to understand and combat the threats posed by    governments, terrorist groups and mischievous teen-agers.    Mr. Deutch's first public statement about information    warfare came in testimony before Senator Sam Nunn, the    Georgia Democrat who called a hearing of a Senate    Governmental Affairs subcommittee to discuss the    little-understood, highly classified problem.    "There are some who believe we are going to have to have an    electronic Pearl Harbor, so to speak, before we really make    this the kind of priority that many of us believe it    deserves to be made," Mr. Nunn said. "Do you think we're    going to need that kind of real awakening, or are we fully    alerted to this danger now?"    Mr. Deutch replied: "I think that we are fully alerted to    it now. I don't know whether we will face an electronic    Pearl Harbor, but we will have, I'm sure, some very    unpleasant circumstances."    He added, "I'm certainly prepared to predict some very,    very large and uncomfortable incidents."    Mr. Deutch said cyberwar could become a 21st-century    national security threat second only to nuclear, biological    and chemical weapons.    Potential attackers may already possess the sophisticated    techniques they would need to bring off a cataclysmic    crash, many experts believe, but they still lack the deep    knowledge of their targets and direct access to the    computer systems they would seek to disable.    Military and civilian organizations are increasingly    dependent on evermore complicated and interlinked systems.    They run the risk of understanding the threat less and less    as it becomes more and more complex Mr. Nunn and Mr. Deutch    suggested.    Senator Nunn also said intelligence agencies have    communications problems with banks, telecommunications    companies and other business ventures vulnerable to cyber    attacks.    "There's a great reluctance by the private sector to    discuss the threat that they've faced or even the attacks    that have already occurred," he said, "because they fear    that the word would go out they're vulnerable, and    therefore could destroy or damage consumer confidence and    thereby cost them business."    "At some point," the Senator added, "there's got to be    communication here."    [End]

The latter part of this article elaborates the NYT report    today.    The Washington Post, June 26, 1996, p. A19.    CIA Gears Up to Thwart 'Information Attacks'       Deutch Lists Computer Break-Ins, Terrorism as       High-Priority Potential Threats to National Security    By R. Jeffrey Smith    CIA director John M. Deutch warned yesterday that the    country is likely to experience some a very large and    uncomfortable" disruptions of vital computer systems at the    hands of foreign terrorists or hostile nations in coming    years, but pledged a major new U.S. effort to detect and    combat the threat of computer break-ins.    "We have evidence that a number of countries around the    world are developing the doctrine, strategies, and tools to    conduct information attacks" on military-related computers,    Deutch told a hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee    on Investigations, while declining to name these nations.    Deutch added that he is convinced that foreigners are    becoming increasingly aware "that advanced societies,    especially the United States, are increasingly dependent on    open and potentially vulnerable" computers to control    electric power, airplane traffic, telecommunications and    financial operations -- posing an attractive target for    virtually "any nation or foreign terrorist organization."    Emphasizing that the Clinton administration has just begun    to grasp the dangers involved and begin working on the    problem, Deutch said "we are not well-organized as a    government to address these issues" and cautioned that    making vital computers much less vulnerable to attack may    take decades.    "The electron is the ultimate precision-guided weapon,"    Deutch said, but "it is not [a problem about] which it's    absolutely apparent ... the best way to proceed."    Deutch said he nonetheless had already drawn up plans to    create an office at the National Security Agency to be    called the Information Warfare Technology Center, which    will focus on analyzing the risks that foreign hackers pose    to U.S. computers and help create new methods of    investigating and defending the U.S. against electronic    break-ins.    Deutch also said that he supports creating a "real-time    response center" for any major domestic or foreign attacks    against civilian computers under the supervision of the    Justice Department, as well as a separate, Defense    Department center for responding to attacks on    military-related computers.    Deutch disclosed that the intelligence community conducted    an extensive survey last year of the risks of an attack on    computers controlling U.S. telephones, the electric power    grid, oil refineries and other utilities. He said the    results are classified, but added that a new, broader    estimate of the threat is to be completed by December.    He also said the intelligence community has begun to hunt    more diligently for evidence of any foreign intent to    attack U.S. computers, any sign of foreign sponsorship for    U.S.-based computer hacking activities, and for any    indication that foreign organized crime figures are    becoming involved in attacks on computers at U.S. financial    institutions.    The Defense Intelligence Agency, moreover, is trying to    develop a way to predict a major "information warfare    attack" against the United States, Deutch said.    One obstacle is that banks and other private institutions    have been reluctant to divulge any evidence of computer    intrusions for fear that it will leak and erode the    confidence of their customers. Deutch said "the situation    is improving" but that more cooperation was needed from    major corporations, and said the CIA remains willing to    share information with such firms about the risks they    might face.    Although he declined to cite any specific examples of    computer warfare, Deutch said he would list it as the    second most worrisome threat to U.S. national security --    just below the threat posed by foreign chemical, nuclear,    and biological arms.    In answer to a question from Senator Sam Nunn (D Ga.) about    whether the government was aware of the danger, Deutch    said, "I don't know whether we will face an electronic    Pearl Harbor, but we will have, I'm sure, some very    unpleasant circumstances in this area or our allies    will.... I'm certainly prepared to predict some very, very    large and uncomfortable incidents in this area."    [End]     Final notice:  Wash Post on the Web at:

@_subject: CIA Fears Hackers, Anonymity 
CIA Director Deutch's comments in the Defense Daily article below about hacker surveillance and the national security threat of anonymity:    "Tools are readily available on the Internet, and    hackers [computer experts] are a source for any    foreign nation or terrorist organization," he said.    The personal anonymity provided by cyberspace also    aids foreign agents, Deutch said, adding that    "hackers, with or without their full knowledge, may be    supplying advice and expertise to rogue states such as    Iran and Libya."    The CIA and other agencies are working to collect    information about hackers and their activities from    both informants and from other advanced means,    including signals intelligence, Deutch said. The CIA    is working closely with the Federal Bureau of    Investigations (FBI) and the Department of Justice to    collect and analyze information about hackers and    their relationships with organized crime and foreign    agents, he said. ------ Defense Daily, 26 June 1996 Deutch Orders Information Warfare Estimate The nation's top intelligence official said Tuesday that he has ordered a major review of foreign threats to the U.S. information, banking, and telecommunications networks.  "The treat of information warfare and the damage it could cause to the U.S. is so significant that it warrants an National Intelligence Estimate (NIE)," John Deutch, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), told the Senate Government Affairs committee yesterday. He added that disruption of the information infrastructure could give terrorists or foreign governments the ability to weaken U.S. national security. "Information attacks could not only disrupt our daily lives, but also seriously jeopardize our national or economic security," he added. Deutch said he ordered the NIE to focus attention on how vulnerable the nation's computer-based telecommunications and information networks are to foreign governments and terrorist groups, which are both, despite their relative differences in personnel and funding, potential threats to U.S. information networks. Information warfare is neither manpower intensive nor an expensive form of terrorism, Deutch said, adding that even the smallest radical group can exploit the unregulated and undefended expanse of cyberspace. For example, the Islamic militant group Hezboullah has been using the Internet and other modern means of communications for their daily operations, Deutch said. Such technology could also be used to launch a terrorist act on the U.S., he added. This NIE will determine the damage terrorists or foreign governments could inflict were they to combine information warfare techniques with conventional military tactics to attack the U.S. An NIE, which details potential security threats to the U.S., is usually crafted by the National Intelligence Council (NIC), a senior panel of career intelligence officers and academics. This NIE, however, will also include comments from the U.S. law enforcement community, the Defense Information Security Agency, the armed services, and representatives from the major telecommunications providers, Deutch said. The threat estimate is expected to be complete by December 1, 1996, he added. Preliminary evaluations conducted by the U.S. intelligence community suggest that such a coordinated information attack could seriously disrupt electric power grids, air traffic control centers, banks and the stock market, or even the operational effectiveness of deployed U.S. military forces. Deutch is concerned about the ease with which enemy agents can obtain the hardware and software required to attack the information infrastructure. "Tools are readily available on the Internet, and hackers [computer experts] are a source for any foreign nation or terrorist organization," he said. The personal anonymity provided by cyberspace also aids foreign agents, Deutch said, adding that "hackers, with or without their full knowledge, may be supplying advice and expertise to rogue states such as Iran and Libya." In addition to the high technology, computer-based threat to the U.S. information infrastructure, foreign agents could use conventional explosives to destroy key information facilities and data processing centers. Previous studies conducted by the U.S. intelligence community suggests that numerous foreign nations are creating "cyber-warfare" techniques for application on the modern battlefield, Deutch said. Those programs are geared towards crippling an enemy's command and control centers or disabling air defense networks, he added. Based upon the progress made by these military programs, disrupting U.S. civilian and commercial information networks would be easy, Deutch said. The U.S. intelligence community has begun several activities in response to the emerging cyber-threat, he said. The CIA and other agencies are working to collect information about hackers and their activities from both informants and from other advanced means, including signals intelligence, Deutch said. The CIA is working closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Department of Justice to collect and analyze information about hackers and their relationships with organized crime and foreign agents, he said. Both the intelligence and law enforcement communities are trying to work with private industry and academia in this cyber-warfare campaign, he said. The Pentagon and the CIA may reorganize existing personnel and efforts to create a new information warfare center at the National Security Agency, he added. -----

@_subject: The End of Science 
Natalie Angier, the sharp-witted science reporter for The    New York Times, reviews "The End of Science," by John    Horgan, a senior writer at Scientific American, in the June        In this intellectually bracing, sweepingly reported,       often brilliant and sometimes bullying book, John Horgan       makes the powerful case that the best and most exciting       scientific discoveries are behind us. He argues that       many scientists today, particularly those he interviewed       for this book, are "gripped by a profound unease." Part       of that malaise results from all the sociopolitical       irritants we've heard about: the dwindling financial       resources, the vicious competition, the strident       antipathy of animal rights activists, religious       fundamentalists, technophobes and the like.       But a far more important source of despair, Mr. Horgan       insists, is that scientists are beginning to sense that       "the great era of scientific discovery is over." The big       truths, the primordial truths, the pure truths about       "the universe and our place in it" have already been       mapped out. Science has been so spectacularly successful       at describing the principal features of the universe, on       a scale from quarks to the superstructure of galaxies,       that the entire enterprise may well end up the       paradoxical victim of its own prosperity. "Further       research may yield no more great revelations or       revolutions," he writes, "but only incremental,       diminishing returns."    While Angier does not agree with his thesis that the major    problems of science have been solved, she commends his    incisive critique of scientists who cannot give up the    dream of omniscience, many of whom he has interviewed for    the book -- Stephen Jay Gould, Roger Penrose, Steven    Weinberg, Daniel Dennett, Stuart Kauffman, Marvin Minsky,    John Wheeler, Frank Tipler and others.    She summarizes Horgan's view of detumescent science:       Where does that leave contemporary scientists? They can       either pursue small, manageable and vaguely boring       science (sequencing the complete complement of human DNA       may fall into this category), or they can turn to what       Mr. Horgan calls "ironic science." Such science is       "speculative, postempirical," resembling literary       criticism "in that it offers points of view, opinions,       which are, at best, interesting." Ironic science is       provocative, he says, but it fails to converge on the       truth. " It cannot achieve empirically verifiable       surprises that force scientists to make substantial       revisions in their basic description of reality," he       writes.    ----------    For those without access to NYT, the full review is    available at:          (11 kb)    Or, we will E-mail a copy.

@_subject: In From the Cold 
June 28 the NYT and Wash Post reported on a new report on    intelligence:       In From the Cold: The Report of the Twentieth Century       Fund Task Force on the Future of U.S. Intelligence.    This report supplements and differs somewhat from the three    released earlier this year by the Brown Commission,    Representative Combest's Committee and the Council on    Foreign Relations. It recommends greater emphasis on    economic intelligence and less on military support as well    as reduction of covert operations. Here's an excerpt from    the Foreword:       The Task Force discerned basic problems that merit far       greater attention. Foremost among them is the       intelligence community's increasing preoccupation with       military priorities since the Soviet Union's collapse,       which has coincided with a decline in the usefulness of       intelligence to civilian policymakers. To help strike a       more equitable balance between the military and civilian       needs of the government, the Task Force proposes       specific recommendations for strengthening what it       perceives to be four pervasive shortcomings: 1) the       atrophying analytic capabilities of the intelligence       community and U.S. foreign policy agencies; 2) the lack       of productive and effective interactions between the       intelligence community and civilian officials who make       foreign policy decisions; 3) a clandestine service whose       costs have too often exceeded its benefits; and 4)       poorly organized, unfocused, and often mediocre economic       intelligence efforts.    The full volume is 275 pages, composed of introductions,     the main 21-page report and three extensive and detailed    background papers of 248 pages.

@_subject: Technology and Privacy 
The Washington Post, July 1, 1996, p. A16.    Technology and Privacy [Letter]    In reference to the May 31 editorial "Plant Lights and    Privacy" commenting on an 11th Circuit Court of Appeals    decision to uphold the use of thermal imaging in cases    involving indoor marijuana growing operations: The U.S.    Supreme Court had just declined to review that 11th Circuit    decision.    On June 11, The Post published a letter from Jack King    ["When Government Can Look Through Walls"] warning us that    thermal imaging, as developed by the military and as used    by civilian law enforcement agencies with the cooperation    of the military, posed an Orwellian threat to citizens    because the government could use the technology to tell if    two people were making love in the privacy of their    bedroom.    To set the record straight, military thermal imaging is    used to support civilian law enforcement only after other    probable cause for a search warrant, such as power bills,    observation of boarded-up windows, vents on the roof to    draw away heat and buys by confidential informants, are    documented. The military is then called in, using thermal    imagers, to determine if there is an unusual heat source in    the house as detected by heat escaping from the house. In    dozens of cases where thermal imaging was used, I have not    observed one case where it could detect the activity of    people in a house, let alone a bedroom. I also have not    observed the technology to have the ability to detect what    people are doing in any room behind closed doors, covered    windows and walls other than to detect blurs or shadows    moving around behind light curtains.    The United States v. Cusumano language quoted by Mr. King    was reversed last month by the court because the original    three judges decided it was an issue that didn't need    deciding, i.e. the constitutionality of thermal imaging    absent a search warrant, and did not exercise "judicial    restraint."    The trend to Mr. King's "militarization" of the war on    drugs, based on a decision by then-secretary of defense    Richard Cheney that drug use represented a threat to our    national security, is being carried out with restraint,    respect for the law and an appropriate appreciation for the    privacy of our citizens.

To complement Tim May's essay on the Net and Terrorism:    The Washington Post, July 1, 1996, Business, p. 22.    Keeping the Military in High Tech [Excerpts]    At Camber Corporation in Springfield, Va., posters, comic    strips and colorful Silicon Graphics Inc. computers dot the    office landscape. Employees banter as they work.    Technical director Bryan Ware, 26, serves as the bridge     between the college-age computer programmers and the     military commanders who authorize the projects. "A lot of     military people don't know or trust technology," he said.     "A lot of computer nerds don't know or trust the military.    I know and like both."    The Army had a congressional mandate to prepare for    terrorists using chemical, biological or even nuclear    weapons and for civilian doctors having to figure out how    to treat the victims. To that end, the Army contracted    Camber to create the Nuclear Biological Chemical Medical    Defense Information Server which has many more bells and    whistles than the average Web site.    On the opening page, "danger" signs line the background.    Articles on the latest terrorist catastrophes appear in the    center of the screen. Black illuminated links to the site's    library, to news and to other information fill the    left-hand side.    Click on the library link, and medical manuals on nuclear,    biological and chemical warfare treatments appear. To the    left, a video section link becomes visible. Click on it,    and an interactive session begins between the user and an    actor playing the role of nuclear, chemical or biological    warfare victim. If the user administers the proper    treatment (it's good to read the library manuals before    going to the video), the victim will survive. If the user    fails to administer the correct procedures, the victim will    die.    "We try to have fun," said Alex Neifert, 21, who's working    on the Army Web site project for the summer before heading    back to the University of Michigan's Graduate School of    Information in the fall.    "We're hoping to improve the preparedness of the military    and civilian communities to deal with these types of    problems. This site will give doctors access to important    information that could save lives in the event of a    terrorist action," said the Army officer in charge of the    project.

7-2-96 UST, page one:    "Companies fear losing privacy, customers' trust."       In a show of self-reliance reminiscent of the old West,       companies are taking matters into their own hands,       hiring security firms to protect their computer systems       and ignoring the convention that law enforcement is the       best defense. It's a stance that has implications for       law enforcement and commerce, raises broad questions of       privacy and control, and pits the philosophy of the       Clinton administration directly against that of many       Fortune 500 companies. "An organization has very little       to gain" by reporting, says Lloyd Hession, of IBM's       Business Recovery Services.       There seems to be universal agreement that the strongest       means for securing computer data against theft lies in       cryptography, but the Clinton administration, citing       fears that criminals would use cryptography to cloak       their activities, is setting regulations slowing       development of cryptography software.       The Clinton administration is to announce, as early as       this week, a commission to determine the federal       government's role in securing cyberspace, from terrorism       to petty crimes.

Would anyone know more about the DEA "process the intercepts by computer"
in the excerpt below from today's Wash Post? Any connection to Peter
Neuman's remarks at the CRISIS press conference about LEA training and
technology as alternatives to breaking strong crypto?    This new funding has been a factor in making possible    increased use of electronic surveillance. Federal wiretaps    cost more than $70,000 a month to operate and generate    hundreds of hours of labor for monitors, transcribers,    surveillance teams and investigators. Larger budgets mean    cost is less of an obstacle.    Building for the future, the DEA is carrying out a $33    million program to replace single-line wiretapping gear    with new equipment that can monitor 40 lines simultaneously    and process the intercepts by computer. The FBI is plowing    millions into developing new intercept techniques for    digital lines and expanding its cadre of agents who use the    bureau's high tech surveillance gear.    "I don't think J. Edgar Hoover would contemplate what we    can do today in terms of technology," Reno testified during    a Senate hearing in May.    The total number of federal wiretaps is just one measure of    the rise in federal surveillance. The build-up also is    evident in the increased use of electronic devices that    record the numbers dialed by a target telephone, and the    origin of calls to it.    These devices allow agents to identify a person's    associates. Beginning in 1993, Justice agencies began using    the court-authorized monitors more often and leaving them    installed for longer periods of time, according to a    Justice Department report.

Business Wire, 9 July 1996:    Note To Editors: For more information on the NIST    initiative, please refer to the NIST press release: "NIST,    Industry Partners to Develop Specifications for Public Key    Infrastructure," July 9, 1996.    ----------     Certicom to Partner with NIST to Develop Specifications for    a Public Key Infrastructure; Certicom signs agreement with    NIST to contribute cryptographic expertise    Toronto -- Certicom Corp. a leading information security    company, today announced that it will participate in an    initiative by the U.S. Commerce Department's National    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) which will    lead to the development of the elements of a public key    infrastructure (PKI).     A PKI will enable individuals and organizations who have    never met to electronically send and receive documents    which have been digitally signed.    NIST announced today that it is partnering with several    companies who bring specialized experience in providing    products or services related to PKI components.    "Certicom is excited about the establishment of this PKI    project. It represents a proactive initiative by the    Commerce Department to develop standards based on existing    technology and commercial and government requirements by    soliciting the active participation of key industry    players," said Skip Hirsh, Director of U.S. Government    Marketing for Certicom.    "The strong leadership position taken by NIST will    accelerate the deployment of practical public key    infrastructures essential for the secure exchange of    electronic data."    "Certicom will contribute significant cryptographic    experience to the partnership, particularly with the    Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC) which is the most    efficient public key technology available," commented Gary    Hughes, president and CEO of Certicom. "ECC is a critical,    enabling technology for this NIST project because of its    efficiency in the high volume applications that are common     in PKIs." ...    Other partners that NIST has signed cooperative research    and development agreements (CRADAs) with include: AT&T    Government Markets, BBN Corp., Cylink Corp., DynCorp    Information & Technology Inc., Information Resource    Engineering Inc., Motorola, Northern Telecom Ltd. (Nortel),    SPYRUS, Inc. and VeriSign, Inc.    The goal of the partnership is to develop a minimum    interoperability specification for the technical components    of a PKI. The results will be shared with participating    companies, the appropriate standards-making bodies, federal    government agencies and industry organizations that are    working on aspects of PKI development.    A public key infrastructure relies on public key    cryptography in which each user has a key pair consisting    of a public and private key. The public key must be    digitally signed by a central authority to ensure its    authenticity. Digital signatures are cryptographic    techniques which are used for data integrity,    authentication and nonrepudiation.    The process of digitally signing public keys is known as    certification and is the main purpose of a public key    infrastructure.    Certicom expects to demonstrate the benefits ECC provides    to large-scale PKIs in which numerous users are signing and    verifying documents.    Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems have the highest strength per    bit of any known public key system, minimizing the    requirement for large key sizes. Cryptographic processes    based on ECC provide efficient computation techniques which    reduce communications and computation time, thereby    substantially reducing costs.    Certicom is a developer of information security products    and technologies and is the leader in Elliptic Curve    Cryptosystems, the world's most efficient public key    technology. The company specializes in applications where    the combination of cryptographic strength and high    efficiency are critical. Certicom's primary markets are in    wireless, smart cards, banking and electronic commerce over    the Internet.    Visit Certicom's home page at      -----

ISBN 0-465-00781-3    Mr. Bailey, a former senior manager at the Thinking    Machines Corporation, foresees an "electronic computing    revolution" whose "intellectual impact will be greater than    anything since the Renaissance, possibly greater than    anything since the invention of language." In his view, the    greatest challenge posed by the computer revolution will be    for humans to trust processes of thinking they won't    necessarily understand, such as neural networks spotting    patterns without supplying proof "in any human-absorbable    form."    His main point is that we must become aware of the outmoded    abstractions on which our sequential thinking is based and    to jettison them in favor of parallel processes. He cites    Alfred North Whitehead: "A civilization which cannot burst    through its current abstractions is doomed to sterility    after a very limited burst of progress." The wonder of Mr.    Bailey's book is that he makes us aware of things abstract    that all our lives we have been trained to think of as    concrete.    -----      (7 kb)    WON_der

Jamie Gorelick, deputy U.S. attorney general, described the    effort as having the "same level of urgency" as the    Manhattan Project, the crash World War II effort to develop    the atomic bomb.

"We are looking for a structure that cuts across the    government and private sector," Ms. Gorelick told the    Senate's Permanent Investigations Subcommittee. While some    22 federal agencies have some involvement with such    problems, she said there is no central mechanism.

@_subject: Devil's Bargain 
The New York Times, July 21, 1996, WIR, p. 5.    The Devil's Bargain of a Better World    By Tim Weiner    Washington. The arc of the burning plane falling into the    ocean, the fire glowing on the dark waters, shed light on    how vulnerable we are. When a jumbo jet falls from the sky,    technology has failed or terrorism has succeeded.    In the hours after Flight 800 went down off Fire Island,    everyone in officialdom said there was no reason to believe    it was a terrorist attack. Nearly everyone else    instinctively believed it was.    However the facts turn out, it is revealing that Americans    thought first of a bomb borne by angry men on a mission    from God. There was no more evidence to blame it on it was    close enough to truth, given the absence of facts,    Americans' shared fear of terror and their faith in    technology.    In any event, if the crash turns out to have been an    accident -- horrible but still an act of God -- the relief    may be fleeting.    "It doesn't matter whether it was a bomb or not, in the way    we think of it -- it's what we expect," said Ronald Steel,    professor of International relations at the University of    Southern California and author of "Temptations of a    Superpower" (Harvard, 1995). "We know it's going to happen    somewhere --if not this airplane, then the World Trade    Center, Lockerbie, the bombs in Saudi Arabia and Paris and    London. This is a part of our life. If for some reason this    wasn't a bomb, we better get ready for one tomorrow." [See    Steel's NYT Op-Ed today:     High-Tech Freedom    With the doubled-edge sword of technology, Americans have    carved a world of gleaming aircraft and guided missiles.    The airplanes that transport them, the cell phones and    television cables and computers that link them, define how    they live, how they work, how they take their pleasure.    They are right up there with freedom of speech and    religion, freedom from want and fear. They make America    rich, powerful, and free.    But Americans cannot control technology; increasingly, it    controls them. And when the people Americans fear get their    hands on it, the fear is accelerated and amplified by 500    channels of interwoven media hype.    The airlines and telephones and E-mail that connect    Americans connect those other people too: a computer disk    is the crucial piece of evidence in the current trial of    Ramzi Ahmed Yusef, accused of planning to blow a fleet of    commercial planes from the sky (and in a pending case, of    leading the World Trade Center bombing).    The subway rider poisoned in Tokyo and the American soldier    blown out of bed in Dhahran share a common knowledge: High    technology may make a fine sword, but it is a flawed    shield. It cannot stop every nut with a grudge.    Americans are slowly getting used to the idea that one can    no longer go through the world without passing through    security. They are learning to live with terror and the    technology of counter-terrorism, as people have for years    in Tel Aviv and Cairo, Belfast and Berlin, Karachi and    Algiers. They all visit those cities now; they enter them    every time they walk through a metal detector.    So life feels more and more like an international airport:    identity checkpoints and security zones in concrete and    glass buildings, pretty flowers planted in concrete    barricades outside, robot voices delivering warnings.    The fear means they arrive early to spend more down time    waiting in line to pass through security. So they adapt,    thinking: That's not a barricade, it's a flowerpot. They    give up a little freedom in exchange for feeling safe, "all    watched over," as the late poet Richard Brautigan wrote,    "by machines of loving grace."    Visitors    The people who hate, love, envy and fear America's    prosperity and power, also pass through that international    airport. The United States needs their oil for fuel; it    needs their sweat for work Americans don't do any more.    They are woven into America, traveling through open lines    of trade and telecommunications and technology.    So everybody learns to live with the fear of the bomb in    the cargo bay: you have to catch that plane if you have    business abroad. If the United States were determined to    buy machines that could sniff out the Semtex in the    boombox, it could have done it -- the cost is perhaps $2    billion, or slightly less than one Stealth nuclear bomber.    But that is not the war Washington prepared to fight after    Vietnam. Generals today want wars they are sure to win.    We -- the United States -- have the smart bombs, built with    the billions that bankrupted Moscow and made America Number    One. They -- the furious and the powerless -- have the dumb    bombs, made from fertilizer and fuel oil, ignited by rage    and religion. But the United States can't stop them all,    not with its ever-tightening laws, not with its trillion-    dollar military, not with its weapons and warheads. So the    thinking goes.    On the simplest level, terrorism works: it terrifies. It    can increase the technology of control and erode the edges    of the Constitution. That can fuel the fear of Big Brother,    make people paranoid -- and in turn promote the homegrown    madness that exploded last year in Oklahoma City. Terrorism    cannot destroy the United States, but it has the power to    wound, outrage, sadden and change it.    When Iranians took Americans hostage and controlled the    nation's politics from half a world away, when a suicide    bomber blew up 241 American soldiers in Beirut and drove    the Marines from Lebanon, when the World Trade Center    shook, when the Dhahran barracks went up in smoke, it    expressed a burning anger in the world, the anger of the    poor and the powerless and the God-mad and the stateless.    The Method    Through repetition, Americans are slowly coming to    recognize the method in this madness: These attacks are    meant as blows against the global dominance of American    culture, money, power and technology.    Mr. Steel says the United States' stature as the one    surviving superpower and the architect of the new world    order is the very thing that makes it a target.    "Terror," he says, "is the weapon that the powerless use    against the powerful. We don't have any conception of what    an ideologically threatening power we are to people who    have different beliefs. Globalization and modernization are    truly threatening to people. They're even threatening to    the working class in this country because they drive down    wages. The very faith in technology that we spread is    something that runs head-on into another faith based on    tradition, asceticism and authority. We're the alien    ideology now."    [End] ----------    The New York Times, July 21, 1996, p. 25.    Top F.B.I. Investigator Is Known for Bluntness    James K. Kallstrom the head of the Federal Bureau of    Investigation s New York City office, is a technical wizard    who has bugged, wiretapped and generally bedeviled    mobsters, terrorists and other criminals for more than two    decades.    The crash investigation is the first major, high-profile    investigation of Mr. Kallstrom's tenure of a year and a    half. Since Wednesday night, Mr. Kallstrom has spent most    of his time shuttling, in a Blackhawk military helicopter,    between the F.B.I. command center, at 26 Federal Plaza in    Lower Manhattan, and the crash site, where he has held two    press conferences a day with a top official of the National    Transportation Safety Board.    Mr. Kallstrom is known for a no-nonsense, blunt approach    with his colleagues. He also never passes up a chance to    express some strongly felt opinions, they say. Often, Mr.    Kallstrom has offered his long-held view that Congress is    not doing enough to help Federal law enforcement in its    fight against criminals who use new technologies, such as    the Internet.    Since the crash Wednesday night, Mr. Kallstrom has had a    strong suspicion that it was tied to a bomb or missile.    "You have a lot of things that look like terrorism," Mr.    Kallstrom said at a press conference Friday afternoon. "At    some point in time, we're going to reach critical mass and    then we're going to be prepared to say exactly what we    think it is." As late as last night, he said he had not    seen anything to make him change that opinion. But    publicly, at least, Mr. Kallstrom has been reluctant to    declare that the crash was caused by a bomb or missile    until physical evidence, enough to reach a "beyond a    reasonable doubt" threshold, is found.    By selecting Mr. Kallstrom as assistant director in charge    of the New York Office in February 1995, the F.B.I.    Director, Louis J. Freeh, chose one of the bureau's most    respected surveillance experts, a man whose techniques    played a critical role in the arrests of every major    organized crime leader and terrorist in New York in the    last 20 years, including those involved with the World    Trade Center bombing in 1993.

John Markoff       MS is preparing to release new software that would bring       the most fundamental change to personal computers since       the machines were invented in the 1970's. Demonstrated       last week and to be distributed free to the public, the       software is designed to blend the multimedia technology       of the Web with Windows 95. PCs would treat each parcel       of material as a document with all the stand-alone       capabilities of a Web page. Each of these documents       would have hyperlinks so that the creator of a document       could make it available for reading, listening or       viewing anywhere on the Web.       "This is going to make enormous changes possible," said       Jesse Berst, editor of Windows Watcher. "It's analogous       to the advent of the automobile." "We're moving into a       new world; we now have a new metaphor," said John Seely       Brown, director of the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto       Research Center.       A potentially troublesome aspect to Microsoft's new       thrust is the extent to which it will further blur the       distinctions between data that sit safely on a person's       own computer and data flowing around the Internet. While       certain measures of privacy and security control are       built into Microsoft's current and planned software, it       is still working to develop better security for Internet       software.    -----        SHI_fty

The Associated Press:    Computer Codes May Aid Crime      Washington -- FBI Director Louis Freeh warned Congress on    Thursday that allowing uncontrolled export of U.S. computer    security codes may help international criminals and    terrorists hide their activities from law enforcement.    "Encryption products used unchecked by criminals and    terrorists for their illegal activities pose an extremely    serious and, I believe, unacceptable threat," Freeh told    the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.    Legislation pending in the Senate would permit U.S.    companies to export high-tech encryption devices that    ensure greater privacy for computer files, electronic mail    messages and systems such as stock exchange transactions.

The Clinton administration has proposed that encryption    exports be allowed only if a decoding "key" for the devices    is left with a third party -- such as a bank or insurance    company -- so that law enforcement personnel with a court    order could break the code, if necessary.    Freeh said such an arrangement would safely open profitable    foreign markets for U.S. software companies. The Internet,    he said, "was never intended as a place without police    officers. We need cops there, as we do elsewhere, to    protect people, to guard their rights."    The encryption codes available today are so powerful, Freeh    said, that it would take the FBI more than a year to decode    a single message in some cases. Ramzi Yousef, on trial in    New York on charges of plotting to bomb a dozen U.S.    airliners, used a laptop computer containing files the FBI    still hasn't been able to decode, he added.    Sponsors and industry officials noted, however, that many    of these devices are already available abroad, and anyone    can download them free from the Internet. They can also be    sold within the United States at local computer stores.    "The criminal element the administration is trying to    prevent from obtaining this technology already has it,"    said Roel Pieper, president of Tandem Computers Inc. "The    only ones who suffer as a result of this policy is the U.S.    industry."    Netscape Communications Corp. President Jim Barksdale    estimated his company will lose $40 million this year in    potential export sales for encryption products.    But a top official at the National Security Agency -- whose    job is to break secret codes -- said the encryption "genie    is not out of the bottle." NSA Deputy Director William    Crowell said encryption won't be widely used until it is    marketed and sold, with support to help people use it.    "The administration's proposal is not designed to keep the    plug in the bottle, but to help provide a full range of    trusted security services," Crowell said.    Industry executives also said use of the decoding keys    would be costly and raises questions about government    access to private business and personal information, such    as bank and medical records.    "Keys can be compromised in many ways. They can be stolen,    revealed by disgruntled employees or obtained through    bribery, Pieper said.    -----

Bill Stallings reports in 7-23-96 Network World on the IETF's proposals for
Net security:    Toward that end, the IETF last summer published five    security-related proposed standards -- RFC 1825 through RFC    1829 -- that define a security capability at the IP level.    IP-layer security encompasses two functional areas:    authentication and privacy. The authentication mechanism    assures that a received packet was, in fact, transmitted by    the party identified as the source in the packet header and    that the packet was not altered in transit. The privacy    facility enables communicating nodes to encrypt messages to    prevent eavesdropping by third parties.    -----        IET_fws

7-27-96. FiTi:    "Colossus faces rebirth into a world of dispute."       The man behind the resurrection of Colossus is Tony       Sale, a computer expert and former MI5 operative who       once worked for Peter Wright of "Spycatcher" fame. Its       reconstruction, now in its final weeks, is not merely an       act of homage to the mathematical supermen of Bletchley       who hastened the Allied victory over the Nazis. Neither       is it just a triumph over the official secrecy in which       the machine was cloaked until a few years ago. It is a       working demonstration of Sale's contention that Colossus       was the world's first computer.       So sophisticated was the machine intelligence at       Bletchley Park that the very existence of Colossus was       not revealed until 1970, according to Tony Sale. After       the war the government ordered 10 Colossi to be broken       up -- some say as part of an intelligence deal with the       Americans.       Gripped by a desire to assert the claims of Colossus,       the former MI5 man asked GCHQ to reinstate his security       clearance so he could work on the project. The parts       could be found in any British telephone exchange up to       the 1970s. Yet it took until 1992 to get all the       electronics declassified. Only last November was Sale       allowed to demonstrate the machine's ability to break       the Lorenz wheel settings. Even today members of the       public are forbidden to operate Colossus: some of its       codebreaking algorithms are still, it seems, a secret.    -----      (15 kb)    COL_oss

@_subject: WaPo on Crypto-Genie Terrorism 
The Washington Post, July 27, 1996, p. A22.    Speaking in Code on the Internet ... [Editorial]    The decibel level has been rising in the argument over how    much control the federal government should have over the    export of encryption technology. The Senate Commerce    Committee held hearings Thursday on a proposal dubbed    Pro-CODE (Promotion of Commerce On-line in the Digital Era)    that would lift current restrictions on exporting    encryption software above a certain level of complexity.    The move is opposed strongly by law enforcement and    national security authorities, who fear the consequences to    their tracking of terrorism or crime if uncrackable    cryptography becomes the global standard.    But encryption software -- which scrambles a person's    computer messages so no one can read them without a key --    also is thought by many in the computer industry to be the    missing piece that's preventing customers from a full-scale    move to the Internet for banking and other confidential    transactions, rather than, as now, worrying about the    security of their data. They also see it as a market in    which the United States maintains a comfortable lead, one    that is threatened if domestic encryption makers can't sell    their products elsewhere. The makers argue that foreign    encryption software will rush in to fill the gap, doing    nothing about the uncrackability problem -- indeed, making    it worse. The administration in turn is pursuing a wider    international agreement to maintain controls on cryptology    export by all the industrialized nations and has been    putting pressure on its colleagues in the Organization for    Economic Cooperation and Development, which will rule on    the matter in a Paris meeting in September.    Administration officials, including FBI chief Louis Freeh,    have been pushing for an alternative policy of "voluntary    key escrow" -- encryption makers would deposit a key to the    code with a neutral third body before exporting the    products and could then have access to the codes only by    court order, as happens now with wiretapping. Mr. Freeh,    testifying at Thursday's hearing in favor of an optional    key escrow plan, noted that the point is not to prevent all    copies of uncrackable code from going abroad --  that's    clearly impossible -- but to prevent such high-level code    from becoming the international standard, with architecture    and transmission channels all unreadable to world    authorities. To software companies and Internet users who    have been clamoring for the right to encrypt as securely as    possible, Mr. Freeh and others argue, "the genie is not yet    out of the bottle" on "robust," meaning uncrackable,    encryption.    It's far from obvious to anyone that an optional escrow    plan really can prevent the growth of inaccessible    transmissions by international terrorists or criminals.    Encryption, if widely used, could conceivably ease some    privacy problems concerning who gets to see personal and    financial data on individuals -- though such data usually    are vulnerable to being dug out of storage rather than    intercepted in transmission. But neither is it clear that    the encryption enthusiasts' desire for free development    should take precedence over the tracking of terrorism. At    the very least, Congress should be exceedingly cautious    about getting out ahead of administration concerns on    controls that, once lifted, are hardly reversible.    -----

@_subject: War of Words 
Financial Times, July 27/28, 1996, p. XVIII.    War of words over the facts    By Peter Aspden     It must be tough to return from a spell of duty as a war    correspondent to a gentle, civilised, country such as    Britain. One minute you are witnessing the most unspeakable    atrocities committed in the name of politics, religion or    just for the hell of it; the next, you are listening to    heated debate over the future of the rugby Five Nations    Championship. It does nothing for your sense of    perspective.    Martin Bell, who covered the Bosnian war with such    distinction for the BBC, left the stench of the Srebrenica    mass executions to breathe the irrelevant odours of    Euro-scepticism and National Lottery-mania over the media    airwaves. It shocked him to the core, as he revealed in a    recent speech: "I ask myself: is this my country? Is it    even my planet?"    Bell's exasperation has led him to question the model of    balanced, dispassionate, objective journalism which has    been the bedrock of BBC -- and indeed most serious    newspaper and broadcasting -- journalism. He now calls it    "bystander journalism". "What I believe in now is what I    prefer to call the journalism of attachment, a journalism    that cares as well as knows."    Predictably, this has set alarm bells ringing.    Traditionalists fussed over their hallowed dictum -- facts    are sacred, comment is free -- with scarcely a pause for    reflection. It is precisely when issues take on a tragic,    awful dimension, they argued, that one needs to stick to    the facts of the matter. There is no room for sentiment on    the front lines.    But Bell's point is well made. The trouble with facts, or    at least those which are given privilege by traditional    journalism, is that they are hard, cold, numbing. If, while    reporting on Srebrenica, one talks about diplomatic    initiatives, talks about talks, United Nations troop    movements, one soon loses one's audience.    It is a lesson which even academics, those ultimate    upholders of cool objectivity, have come to appreciate. I    remember the American philosopher Richard Rorty beginning    a lecture on human rights to Oxford University students    with a harrowing account of a Bosnian Moslem having his    penis bitten off. The atmosphere became electric, no mean    feat for the Sheldonian Theatre.    We probably would not hear of such incidents in a normal    news account from Bosnia; we certainly would not see    anything related to it, on grounds of poor taste. But the    sexual sadism which is a component of virtually every    ethnic cleansing campaign there has ever been is a fact,    too. Not a cold, hard fact, but one which has the power to    move people. Therein lies its strength.    It is not as if the media show any consistency here. On    certain occasions, they are only too willing to allow news    reports to emote. When we see an interview with a    distressed relative whose family has been wiped out or gone    missing, we are meant to feel for them. And the police    exploit that feeling: they hope that public compassion will    turn to solid leads. The facts here are heart-wrenching.    But, more importantly, they are facts with which we can    identify. It requires little imagination to see ourselves    in the wretched situation we watch on the small screen. We    know what it is like to lose a loved one, or we feel we    know. What we find difficult is to move from micro to    macro.    What happened at Srebrenica, like what happened at    Auschwitz and Belsen, is almost unimaginable. And faced    with the unimaginable, we go cold. This applies to news    reports as well as the self-defence mechanisms of our    fragile emotions. One cannot countenance sitting down after    dinner in front of the television to hear of such    brutalities, let alone see them.    But that is no excuse. The trouble with cold facts is that    they harden, while all the time we should be being    tenderised. And then we fall to that terrible disease of    fattened western sensibilities, "compassion fatigue".    We should listen to Martin Bell. He knows a thing or two    about human behaviour which most of us choose to exclude    from our worldview. We should have heard more from him on    the horrors of Bosnia, and less on the grotesquely    inadequate responses of our gentle, civilised countries as    they sought to respond to the unthinkable.

AmBank, July 29, 1996:       Technologists at banks with large overseas operations       have drawn encouragement from a National Research       Council report suggesting that businesses be allowed       stronger forms of data encryption. Although financial       transactions are generally exempt from encryption       restrictions, bankers advocate more freedom in the       market. They complain that government officials often       refuse their requests for international use of       applications with strong cryptography -- and give no       reasons for their decisions.    NiSaShi, July 23, 1996:       Japan ID Tech, an Osaka-based information technology       startup, has developed a system for encoding text as       graphical images that can be sent via fax over normal       communications transmission lines. The system consists       of software that converts text to a two-dimensional bar       code called a CP code, which is gaining popularity as a       next-generation coding system. The company's encoding       program also incorporates DES.

@_subject: Reuter on P8 Anti-Terrorism 
G7, Russia adopt anti-terror pact, avoid sanctions    Date: Tue, 30 Jul 1996 10:00:07 PDT    PARIS (Reuter) - The world's major powers closed ranks to     combat terrorism Tuesday, urging other nations to join    forces with them but sidestepping a dispute over U.S.    demands for sanctions against what Washington calls    "terrorist states."    Foreign and security ministers from the Group of Seven    industrial nations and Russia approved a list of 25    measures to defeat terrorists around the globe.    "We will not stop in this united effort until those    responsible are brought to justice," U.S. Attorney General    Janet Reno told a news conference after the five-hour    meeting of the so-called P8 nations -- P being for    political.    The package included pledges to reinforce police    cooperation and training, share intelligence, ease    extradition and legal assistance, dry up sources of funding    and weapons and strengthen national anti-terrorism    legislation.    The ministers also vowed to prevent extremists from using     the Internet computer network to plan attacks and spread     bomb-making instructions.    Participants heard Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy     recount how his 11-year-old son had shown him where to find    such content on the Internet.    French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said the meeting    had achieved its two objectives, "to adopt concrete    measures and to send a very clear signal to the    international community and to public opinion that the    leaders of the P8 are strongly determined to act    shoulder-to-shoulder, hand-in-hand."    Under-Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff said the U.S.    delegation had not raised President Clinton's contentious    call for "strong sanctions" against four states he says    support terrorism -- Iran, Iraq, Libya and Sudan.    France, Japan, Britain and Germany all made clear they    would not accept U.S. legislation to punish foreign firms    that dealt with such countries.    "We did not discuss country-specific cases ... We recognize     the fact that some of legislation passed in the United    States recently has encountered opposition among our    trading partners," Tarnoff said.    French Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre, who co-chaired     the meeting, said before it began: "The American analysis    is a bit simplistic and a bit outdated. If we look at the    phenomenon of terrorism today, we can see that it's more    complex."    He cited the bomb attack that killed two people and wounded     110 at the Atlanta Olympic Games last Saturday as evidence    of what he called "home-grown terrorism" without outside    help.    State-sponsored and extreme-left terrorism were largely a     thing of the past, and the international community now    faced two virulent new forms -- regionalist extremism and    religious militancy -- which did not have state support,    Debre said.    The United States offered extra proposals to tighten    airport security and mark explosives chemically so bombers    can be more easily traced, which the other countries    accepted.    Axworthy voiced widely shared alarm at the use of poison    gas in recent attacks in Japan, including on the Tokyo    subway.    "We are beginning to see terrifying signs of what the    future could hold if we don't take strong action.    Terrorists are now getting access to weapons of mass    destruction, chemical weapons, biological weapons, even    nuclear weapons," he said.    "It's (a threat) that really has a doomsday quality unless     we act now," he said.     The United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan    and Russia agreed that solving regional conflicts and    stabilizing crisis areas was the best way to tackle the    roots of terrorism.    "There must be no safe havens," German Foreign Minister    Klaus Kinkel said.    The ministers agreed their experts would hold follow-up    meetings to draft a new international convention to prevent    the abuse of political asylum to plan, fund or commit    terrorist acts and to coordinate security in public    transport.    Japan said it would hold an Asia-Pacific counter-terrorism     seminar by next June including Asian and Latin American    experts.    [End]

Excerpts of four reports on the G7+1 antiterrorism meet in    Paris:    WSJ:       + Mass Transport: The International Civil Aviation       Organization will implement new standards for bomb       detection at domestic and international airports. The       eight nations will jointly develop standards for more       detailed and accurate passenger and cargo lists, as well       as new vehicle-identification tagging methods to make       car-bombing investigations easier, U.S. officials said.       + Information Sharing: The U.S Federal Bureau of       Investigation will lead an effort to develop an       international forensic database. The FBI offered to       share certain computer records with the other seven       countries.       + Wiretapping and Internet: The eight countries said       they would develop new lawful means to intercept       communications among terrorists. They agreed to study       how to prevent the Internet from becoming a tool for       planning and executing terrorist events.       + Explosives Tracing: The U.S. will share its research       on new technologies to trace the origin of explosive       devices U.S. officials said, and will push for       international use of such technologies if they are found       to be workable.       + Other Measures: Controlling trade in certain weapons       and chemicals financing of terrorist organizations and       forgery of travel documents also will be studied.    WaPo:       The 25-point plan calls for close cooperation in       formulating a range of security measures, including       tightened controls on firearms and explosives;       prevention of terrorist communications on the Internet;       improved bomb detection methods at airports; and       interdiction of terrorist groups' financial resources.       They also called for the expediting of extradition       procedures and faster exchanges of information on       terrorist activities, including any use of chemical,       biological or nuclear materials. Details on all 25       points were left for law enforcement and forensic       experts to work out, with deadlines for finalization of       specific measures set for 90 days to six months.    FiTi:       Among the measures agreed in Paris were an accelerated       programme of research designed to find ways to mark       explosives so their origin could be identified after a       blast; the development of ways to prevent terrorists       using electronic or wire communication systems,       including the Internet and tougher sentences. The       ministers also called for investigations into       organisations with social, charitable and cultural goals       which were abused by terrorists; restrictions on asylum-       seeking by those who had committed attacks or were       suspected of planning or funding them; and more       effective border controls and extradition procedures.    NYP:       The details were not all made public today, but the       measures the officials agreed to draft included devising       methods to monitor terrorist attempts to communicate       over the Internet; developing standards to make it       easier to trace the origin of explosives used in       terrorist bombs and cracking down domestically on the       manufacture, sale, transport and export of explosives       and firearms. ----------    For extensive background, links to related sites and latest    information on the G7 series of meetings see:        ----------    For today's four full reports:       (20 kb for 4)    G7T_err

geo-technology and geo-politics: One reviews the explosives sniffing technology invented by geologist
Anthony Barringer for global mineral exploration -- like copper, luxury
metals and oil -- but which came to have more practical utility in the
antiterrorist market (the company's stock is rocketing). Even so, its best
use may prove to be in discovering petroleum and other wealth of the earth.
As this tech becomes more widespread, Shell has good reason to encrypt its
geological logs and steganographize its governmental bribes. And, a column reviews the tie between nationalist conflicts (markets for
cheap explosives) and the invention of modern states (markets for expensive
munitions). How the citizenry of modern nations are united by "the need for
context-free communication" that was once limited to the members of the
"high culture" of pre-modern communities. And how the nationalist citizenry
are adopting the cheap versions of expensive munitions of the states' high
culture to get their overdue share of the earth's pie. It explores the

New encryption ICs on PCMCIA cards will be unveiled       imminently to allow PC users to make transactions over       the Internet with ironclad security. "This will open up       electronic commerce pervasively and launch a new market       for PCs," said TIS's Bill Sweet. Both National       Semiconductor and VLSI Technology plan to unveil       affordable chips shortly for PCMCIA encryption cards.       National's thumb-scan project, which aims to provide an       additional security factor, is a joint effort with       Identix. In this system, a holographic laser chip on the       card would image a portion of the holder's thumbprint.       That image will be compared with the holder's digital       thumbprint pattern stored on a memory chip in the card.    7-31-96. Jane's:    "Future Warfare | Rise of the robots."       A US Defense Science Board (DSB) task force is putting       the final touches to a study that members promise will       be one of the most controversial ever produced by the       panel. The next century adversary will aggressively use       offensive information warfare, rely on underground and       covert urban facilities and have some ability to attack       low earth orbiting satellites. It will require a       "revolution in military affairs" achieved through       enhanced surveillance capabilities, weapons of mass       destruction, thousands of inexpensive missiles, a few       very low observable cruise missiles, mines and diesel       submarines.

8-2-96. WaJo:    "More Bombs Are Exploding Across the U.S."       What also worries law-enforcement officials are the       comparatively unspectacular bombs exploding at a rising       rate in neighborhoods across the country. Indeed, with       homicides declining, bombings may have become the       fastest-growing category of violent crime. "In the old       days, kids would break windows," says John O'Brien, an       agent in Washington with the federal Bureau of Alcohol,       Tobacco and Firearms. "Now, they're making pipe bombs."       Police say one of the most popular bombs among       youths -- one combining acid and other ingredients in a       bottle -- is called the "McGyver" because many learned       about it from the television show. David Estenson, head       of a bomb-crisis management firm and former head of the       Minneapolis police bomb squad, observes that many of the       pipe bombs in Israel contain only match heads.    "U.S. Studies Use of Chemical Tracers To Track Explosives    in Terrorist Blasts."       The Treasury Department is studying a family of trace       chemicals -- first developed by U.S. weapons scientists       to track the fallout of nuclear weapons -- as a way to       give terrorist explosives an identifiable trail. The       trace chemicals are newer and much smaller than plastic       "taggants," which have provoked resistance from the       explosives industry and gun lobbies. Desmonde Cowdery,       vice president of Isotag L.L.C., a small Houston company       that has obtained commercial rights to the process,       claims the chemical tracers are so small they can be       blended with all types of explosives, including       fertilizers and gunpowders, without interfering with       chemical reactions.    "Can America Stomach a War on Terror?"       The lessons from the world's battlefields of terror are       sobering. Not only have few countries been able to make       much of a dent in a determined terrorist campaign, but       their efforts also often incur a heavy price.       Due-process rights have been suspended, freedoms of       speech curtailed, police powers beefed up.       Tommy Sands, a Belfast folk singer, praises America's       caution. He says that in Northern Ireland and other hot       spots, authorities have often overreacted to the initial       threat. "It's like driving a car and seeing a red light       come on that means you're short on oil. If you take a       hammer to it, the red light will go out, but you're       still short on oil," Mr. Sands says. "Sometimes there       are answers other than the big hammer."    -----      (19 kb for 3)    Lynx:     BOO_mer

Computer Reseller News, 8-05-96, p. 51    Channel feels pinch of export limitations -- VARs Hit    Encryption Roadblock    By Charlotte Dunlap & Deborah Gage    Could 40 bits of code cost you that multimillion-dollar    bid?    Andrew Sheppard, president of Branford, Conn.-based Espion    Inc., just returned from a frustrating business trip to    Europe, where he said he lost a number of accounts with    financial institutions because he could not deliver    software with more than 40 bits of encryption key length.    Sheppard, who recently tried to sell his encryption wares    to clients in Europe, said he lost business to competitors    offering stronger encryption.    "There is a real demand for this type of product, and yet    I find myself thwarted at every single opportunity by this    stupid law, which everyone realizes is unnecessary,"    Sheppard said.    Sheppard said potential clients that turned him down during    his recent trip included Banco Santander, a Madrid-based    bank; the London office of Credit Suisse; Logica Systems of    London; and the financial reporting arm of Reuters' news    service in London.    As the trend toward networking-sensitive information grows,    woes tied to encryption export limitations are spreading to    the VAR community. The dilemma of shipping overseas    anything other than light versions of security software is    starting to sabotage the efforts of Internet resellers.    Because 40 bits of code is considered to be breakable by an    elementary hacker, major corporations with data to protect    are reluctant to trust U.S. technology. So, U.S. resellers    are being turned away while multinational corporations turn    to foreign technologies.    The debate between business and the U.S. government about    export limitations is getting increasingly heated with the    growth of the Internet. The Pro-Code Bill, which aims to    relax export restrictions, has just been introduced, and    prominent Silicon Valley executives are trekking to    Washington regularly to argue the case. Jim Bidzos,    president and chief executive of encryption market leader    RSA Data Security Inc., Redwood City, Calif., has spent a    lot of time in Washington.    "The big picture in terms of what's happening is all of our    communications and document storage is moving from paper    and filing cabinets to the Internet and disk drives. We    need crypto technology in order to protect this," he said.    But resellers are getting discouraged and do not see a    quick resolution with law makers. Meanwhile, they are    losing business at a staggering rate.    Norm Yamaguchi, director of sales for RSA master reseller    Secure Distribution Inc., said he could have tripled the    size of his million-dollar company this year if it were not    for U.S. export laws dictating a maximum 40-bit key    encryption length to his clients' international offices.    "To say this law is causing me problems is a massive    understatement," Yamaguchi said. The reseller currently is    in talks with Price Waterhouse to get them to standardize    on Oakland, Calif.-based Secure Distribution's security    products, but will likely lose the contract because of the    40-bit key length limitation.    Resellers' fear of losing business to foreign players is    not paranoia, either. The Business Software Alliance has    identified 500 encryption products that can be purchased in    foreign countries. Information about the stronger foreign    technology can be obtained easily through the Internet.    "The laws are punishing U.S. companies, and we're losing    business to foreign countries because they can offer the    same thing. The law is not holding back the flow of    encryption, it is just holding back U.S. companies from    making money," he added, calling it a "lose-lose    situation."    Reseller Al Hill, vice president of engineering for    Successful Systems Solutions, Rancho Cordova, Calif., has    to surrender part of his solutions services in order to    keep his foreign clients.    "We ship units to England, Hong Kong and Singapore, and we    have to downgrade the software [to 40 bits] on all of them.    They were rather upset but smart enough to realize they    could upgrade the security themselves," he said, adding    that he has lost business because he could not complete    projects himself.    "We have to make sure the APIs in the software are    available so people overseas can tie them into their    [security] applications," he said. Similarly, Dave Johnson,    senior account manager of Precision Computers Inc.,    Portland, Ore., said he lost an account with a    multinational company with offices in France because "it    became too troublesome for them to implement U.S. products    because of the legal problems."    Uncle Sam's View    U.S. companies and civil libertarians have been battling    the government since 1991, when the proposal of the Clipper    Chip first surfaced. At that time, the government proposed    splitting the encryption keys and holding a portion of them    in escrow, giving law enforcement officials with court    orders a back door through which to conduct electronic    surveillance. To date, the U.S. government has budged    little from its original idea.    The Clipper Chip idea was squelched, but the government    refuses to concede that strong encryption is not a munition    because it believes national security is at stake. In    recent weeks, Vice President Al Gore proposed a compromise:    The government would extend the types of software that    could be exported, perhaps to include healthcare or    insurance instead of just finance, and allow long keys if    countries where the United States has government-to-    government agreements could hold keys in escrow. A    24-member technical advisory committee is expected to    produce a blueprint for establishing the Federal Key    Management Infrastructure in September.    The Vendor's View    Software executives remain disgruntled with the    government's progress. "Do we really want government-    to-government agreements?" asked Eric Schmidt, Sun    Microsystems Inc.'s Chief Technology Officer. "The U.S. has    protections that other countries don't. France, for    example, is noted for industrial espionage."    Microsoft Corp. Senior Vice President Craig Mundie said an    escrow system would create an expensive bureaucracy,    adding: "This should really be described as a key-leasing    system. This will create a huge new business in extracting    keys from the public. If you want to make sure that your    key is not compromised by law enforcement officials, you're    going to need insurance. There will be a whole service    industry around keys."    Vendors also argue that the government's reasoning is not    legitimate. "The current controls do not keep encryption    out of the hands of the criminals. They keep it out of the    hands of individuals and corporations," said Sybase Inc.    Director of Data and Communications Security Development    Thomas Parenty.    Sun, Microsoft and other companies would like complete    deregulation of encryption. Three bills that would lift    government restrictions and prohibit mandatory key escrow    are working their way through Congress, although none are    likely to pass this year.

The Washington Post, August 7, 1996, p. A6.    CIA Probed in Alleged Arms Shipments       Reports Claim Agents Involved in Arkansas-Nicaragua Drug       Swaps    By Susan Schmidt    The CIA's inspector general is investigating claims that    U.S. intelligence agencies were involved in illegal arms    shipments and drug smuggling at an isolated airstrip in    Mena, Ark., during the years Bill Clinton was governor.    A spokesman for the CIA said Inspector General Frederick P.    Hitz is preparing a report on allegations that the CIA was    involved in arms shipments from Mena to the Nicaraguan    rebels during the 1980s, and that pilots hired by the    agency brought back large shipments of cocaine.    CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said the inspector general    will report on possible contacts between the agency and    Arkansas state officials during the 1980s. His report also    will deal with allegations that the CIA attempted to    influence or curtail law enforcement investigations of    Mena.    Hitz was asked to investigate the Mena airport by CIA    Director John M. Deutch, who was acting on a request from    House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach (R-Iowa).    Leach's panel is looking into the possible laundering of    drug money generated at Mena.    Leach's Banking Committee staff has been looking a variety    of claims about Mena emanating from a collection of    Arkansas law enforcement officials and various figures    operating in the shadowy netherworld on contract with    intelligence agencies.    One congressional investigator likened sorting through the    allegations to being trapped in "a hall of mirrors."    Congressional sources said Leach made the request to the    CIA about six months ago and expects a report from Hitz in    late summer or early fall.    The latest Mena claims are contained in "Boy Clinton," a    book by American Spectator Editor R. Emmett Tyrrell    published this week. In it, Tyrrell asserts that Clinton    knew about CIA operations and cocaine smuggling at Mena.    He cites as sources Arkansas state troopers, including one    on the governor's security detail who says he was also a    contract employee for the CIA during the mid-1980s and    informed Clinton of what was going on at Mena.    Clinton has said he had nothing to do with any activities    at Mena. "Mena is the darkest backwater of the right wing    conspiracy industry," said White House spokesman Mark    Fabiani. "The allegations are as bizarre as they are    false."    [End]

Finger your delete key: What caught my eye in Tim's remarks about Apple was his continued use of
Macs. Why was that enticing? It has to do with what hard-headed physicists know about hardware that
soft-headed coders don't. So my curiosity: does Tim know Intel intel that we don't know, and can't
tell it? More generally, do chip physicists know what crypto coders don't,
about the covert features of those world-pervasive chips inside? Would Tim tell, could Tim disclose intel, what the world doesn't know about
Intel, about what Intel's hard-headed Moore, the immigrant physicist,
whispers in utmost secrecy to Microsoft's soft-headed Gates, the
American-way coder? Is soft-hearted OS code the front for cold-hearted
hardware spying? Maybe the most that Tim can tell without exposing Intel is that Tim uses
Macs. Still, is Motorola more trustworthy than Intel, and if so, for whom? What
do Apple insiders know that the world needs to know about the deals of
Intel insiders, are they working with inside the Beltwayers, gobbling
world-markets, gobbling intel chip by chip? Is Motorola doing the same with
its adorable cellulars and satellites and boards and hardware galore, using
benign code to conceal hardware malice? Dreamy, maybe, but hard-hearted Tellers did it to the Oppenheimers, and
everyone knows that physicists truly enjoy playing dice with God. (Hold on, Tim, this is the way I write after thirty years of grinding out

Network World, August 26, 1996, Page 1    Key-escrow firewall ready to leave the country    by Ellen Messner, Washington D.C.    After months of talk about exporting encryption software,    there will finally be action.    Fulfilling the Clinton Administration's vow to end export    restrictions on strong encryption products if they use    key-escrow features, the U.S. government this week is    expected to permit Trusted Information Systems, Inc.    (TIS) to sell its Data Encryption Standard (DES)-equipped    Gauntlet firewall overseas.    Such exports will allow U.S.-based companies to    standardize on an encrypting firewall for all global    operations.    The Department of Commerce is granting mass-market export    status to a specific version of the Gauntlet firewall    based on a key-escrow scheme that gives U.S. law    enforcement access to a master key for decrypting IP    datastreams.    The master key for each firewall will reside at Oakland,    Calif.-based Source Files, Inc., the third-party private    key holder chosen under the government's groundbreaking    plan.    Vice President Al Gore has supported the Defense    Department's view that unbreakable encryption should be    controlled because it is a powerful weapon and subject to    misuse by criminals and terrorists. However, Gore    recently said the government will allow mass export of    64-bit encryption products if they use key escrow. The    agreement with TIS is the first evidence that the policy    is being put into practice.    Until now, few companies other than banks could get the    State Department and National Security Agency (NSA) to    let them export 56-bit and higher Data Encryption    Standard (DES) products. Only 40-bit products, easily    broken with available computer resources, were allowed    for mass-market export.    "We're on the verge of a major shift," said TIS president    Steve Walker last week. TIS expects to unveil a raft of    other vendors in the network industry that will license    the TIS data recovery method for accessing data encrypted    with a session key.    The government is also considering approving other third-    party keyholders in addition to Source File, which has    traditionally held source code in escrow on behalf of    companies worried about the long-term viability of their    suppliers.    Just say no    Not all are key-escrow converts, however. In fact, it is    painfully clear that corporations will continue to balk    at the prospect of their encryption keys being held by a    third party or the government.    Netherlands-based Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., with    hundreds of subsidiaries and offices all over the world,    is looking to ditch dedicated private lines and send    encrypted IP traffic over the Internet instead.    The State Department's mass-market license for the    Gauntlet means TIS can compete to provide Royal Dutch    Petroleum with its encrypting firewall. But Homayoon    Tajalli, TIS vice president, acknowledged that the Dutch    oil conglomerate is unwilling to hand its encryption keys    over to Source File.    Hence, as part of negotiations with the U.S. and Dutch    governments, Royal Dutch Petroleum agreed to operate its    own data recovery center for the Gauntlet master keys.    Royal Dutch Petroleum would hand over the master    encryption keys to to Dutch law enforcement, which in    turn would give the keys to U.S. authorities "if the    government shows up with a valid warrant," Tajalli said.    TIS went to great lengths to broker the international    arrangement, and hopes that not every firewall export    will entail such laborious negotiations.

Computer Profiles,    High-Tech Detectors Central to System"       A presidential commission on aviation security is       considering a bomb detection plan that would require       U.S. airlines to scrutinize all passengers at U.S.       airports using massive computer files to identify       potential terrorists or other suspicious individuals.       The plan would require creation of a computer profiling       system that would examine passengers' bill-paying       records, flying habits and much other data to determine       which checked baggage should undergo examination by       sophisticated explosives detection equipment.       Numerous legal issues still need to be resolved,       including thorny civil liberties questions such as       whether the airlines would be given access to       information from government computer systems like those       containing criminal records.

Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct, Lead Essay:    "Postmodern Terrorism. The terrorism of the future may be    far more destructive than terrorism as we have known it."    An informative survey and pot-heat by Walter Laqueur.       Terrorism's prospects, often overrated by the media,       the public, and some politicians, are improving as its       destructive potential increases. Terrorism has       replaced wars between nations of the 1800s and 1900s.       In the future, terrorists will be individuals or       like-minded people working in very small groups. An       individual may possess the technical competence to       steal, buy, or manufacture the weapons he or she needs       for a terrorist purpose. The ideologies such       individuals and minigroups espouse are likely to be       even more aberrant than those of larger groups. And       terrorists working alone or in very small groups will       be more difficult to detect unless they make a major       mistake or are discovered by accident.       Society has also become vulnerable to a new kind of       terrorism, in which the destructive power of both the       individual terrorist and terrorism as a tactic are       infinitely greater. The advanced societies of today       are more dependent every day on electronic       information. That exposes enormous vital areas of       national life to mischief or sabotage by any computer       hacker, and concerted sabotage could render a country       unable to function.       Why assassinate a politician or indiscriminately kill       people when an attack on electronic switching will       produce far more dramatic and lasting results? If the       new terrorism directs its energies toward information       warfare, its destructive power will be exponentially       greater than any it wielded in the past -- greater       even than it would be with biological and chemical       weapons. The single successful one could claim many       more victims, do more material damage, and unleash far       greater panic than anything the world has yet       experienced.    -----      (30 kb)    POT_hot  (in 2 parts)

Financial Times, September 4, 1996, p. 4.    Singapore looks to superhighway    By James Kynge in Kuala Lumpur    Singapore took another step toward its vision of becoming    an "intelligent island" yesterday, announcing an initiative    to link the city-state's main on-line networks.    Mr Goh Chee Wee, Singapore's minister of state for    communications, said the "internetwork hub" would link    service providers of the Internet, government on-line    networks, commercial networks and some others.    Singapore's move follows an ambitious scheme announced by    neighbour Malaysia last month to launch an "information    superhighway" designed to attract the world's leading    information technology companies to Kuala Lumpur.    The perceived advantage in Singapore's initiative is that    users will be able to access all networks using a single    leased line, rather than the separate lines currently    necessary.    The hub will use a single set of national standards,    meaning inter-operability between networks becomes easier.    Mr Goh said the hub should be up and running by the end of    the year. A mechanism to identify users electronically    would be incorporated into the hub network next year,    paving the way for secure operations such as payments,    banking and confidential correspondence.    The move is part of the Information Technology 2000    masterplan, a scheme which aims to accomplish the sometimes    conflicting aims of exploiting the information superhighway    to its full potential while continuing to insulate    Singaporeans from undesired influences.    From September 15, the city-state will implement its first    big attempt to police cyberspace. From then all Internet    providers must channel more than 120,000 subscribers on the    island through "proxy servers" before they reach the net.    These servers will check every Internet site a subscriber    requests and block access to a about a dozen banned sites    known to display pornography. The government has warned    against material deemed politically subversive or inciting    religious disharmony.    [End]

The New York Times, September 6, 1996, p. D2.    Behind an Internet Message Service's Close       Pressure From Church of Scientology Is Blamed for the       Shutdown. A Finnish judge says different rules apply to       E-mail.    By Peter H. Lewis    Pressure from the Church of Scientology International was    at least partly responsible for the recent shutdown of a    well-known Internet messaging service based in Helsinki,    according to the Finnish operator of the service.    The service, known by its Internet address, anon.penet.fi,    was used by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide to    send and receive electronic messages without divulging    their true identities. It was the best known of a small,    global network of special computers known as remailers,    whose legitimate users include political dissidents, people    with medical or drug ailments and others who want to    communicate anonymously.    Although previous news accounts had reported that the    service was shut down because of accusations that it was a    primary conduit for child pornography transmitted on the    Internet, police investigators in Helsinki dismissed those    accusations as groundless.    The real reason for terminating the service, according to    its founder and operator, Johan Helsingius, was a recent    Helsinki court ruling that ordered him to reveal the true    name of one of his system's users to the Church of    Scientology. The judge held that under Finland's current    telecommunications laws, Internet electronic mail does not    carry the same privacy protections enjoyed by postal mail    or telephone calls.    The church, which in recent years has been trying to    protect its copyrighted scriptures by trying to block their    dissemination over computer networks, said an unknown    person or persons had used the anon.penet.fi computer to    illegally publish copyrighted church documents on Usenet,    the global electronic bulletin board.    Mr. Helsingius, a 35-year-old computer networking expert,    has not yet revealed the name sought by the Scientologists,    and said he planned to appeal the court ruling. But he said    the court ruling opened the door for future subpoenas    seeking the real names of anon.penet.fi users, and that he    would rather close the system than spend all his time in    court.    Mr. Helsingius has operated anon.penet.fi for more than 3    years, handling over 7,000 messages a day.    "In a sense I've done my pioneer work and it is now up to    others to carry on," Mr. Helsingius said.    Helena Kobrin, a Church of Scientology official, said the    complaint against anon.penet.fi was just one of several    actions the church had taken against the operators of    remailer computers in Europe and the United States. She    said the church has five lawsuits pending in the United    States against remailer operators and users of remailers.    "We have actively been in communication with various    remailers about postings that have gone through their    systems," said Ms. Kobrin, general counsel for the    Religious Technology Center in Los Angeles, which is    responsible for protecting the copyrights and trade secrets    of unpublished Scientology scriptures.    Earlier this year, another remailer, known as hacktic.nl,    in the Netherlands, was shut down under pressure from the    Scientologists.    Unlike many other churches, the Church of Scientology,    founded nearly 40 years ago by the science fiction author    L. Ron Hubbard, regards its gospel as copyrighted material    and a trade secret. Several courts have upheld the validity    of the copyrights.    Foes and critics of the church have used the Internet to    publish the church documents, as well as other documents    the church contends were stolen from its computers.    The Religious Technology Center has also unsuccessfully    attempted to put a stop to the forum on Usenet,     alt.religion.scientology, where many of the copyrighted    documents are published.    A series of recent news articles in The Observer of London    among others had linked the anon.penet.fi computer to    accusations it was a conduit for child pornography.    Mr. Helsingius, who has denied that his system is a conduit    for child pornography, declined to speculate on the motives    of the accusers. The accusations of child pornography first    appeared several days after Mr. Helsingius declined to turn    over to the court the name sought by the Scientologists.    The Observer quoted Toby Tyler, identified as an adviser to    the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as saying    anon.penet.fi was the source for up to 90 percent of the    child pornography on the Internet.    But Richard P. (Toby) Tyler, a sergeant in the San    Bernardino, Calif., County Sheriff's Department who said    his involvement with the F.B.I. was minimal, said he was    misquoted by the newspaper. Mr. Tyler, who has investigated    pornography trafficking in cyberspace, said that most child    pornography on the Internet did not pass through remailers.    He did say, however, that of the small portion that does,    70 percent to 90 percent passes through anon.penet.fi.    "I think that's a shame," Sergeant Tyler said upon learning    that anon.penet.fi was closed. "I personally view its    closing as a loss of freedom. I did not like the abuse of    the remailer for child pornography, but I felt it served a    necessary political purpose in this world."    Ms. Kobrin of the Religious Technology Center said that    despite its legal actions, the Church of Scientology does    not oppose the operation of remailers, which are also known    as anonymous servers.    "We were not opposing the existence of his server," Ms.    Kobrin said. "We have no opposition to there being    anonymity for private, consensual communications. What we    oppose is using anonymous servers for the purpose of    permitting criminal or other unlawful acts. There has to be    responsibility and accountability."    [End]

The Economist, September 7, 1996, p. 79.    Cryptography: Puzzling secrets    The truly paranoid have but one friend: mathematics.    Nothing (and nobody) else can be as trusted to keep a    secret. To transmit your credit card number, for example,    through an Internet full of thieves, the best way is to    hide it in a mathematical problem so excruciatingly    difficult that no thief could ever crack it, even by    hijacking all the world's computers for the effort.    Devising such problems is the business of cryptographers.    To be useful, the problems must be easy to create as well    as impossible to unravel. Multiplying numbers is very    easy. Taking the result and working out what numbers were    multiplied together to produce it (known as    factorisation) is a lot more difficult. It is not obvious    that 4,294,967,297 is the product of 641 and 6,700,417.    The two smaller numbers in this calculation are prime:    that is, neither can be factorised into two further    smaller numbers. The coding systems generally used by    governments, businesses and software companies such as    Netscape (known as RSA encoding schemes, after Ronald    Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who invented the    idea in 1977), mix a number even huger than 4,294,967,297    into a message, and then churn it in such a way that only    the number's prime factors can undo the mess. The big    number is used to make a "public key" (each user has his    own, but it is available to those who might wish to    communicate with him). The two prime factors compose a    private key, guarded carefully by their owner.    The trouble is that nobody is absolutely sure how safe    this scheme is. At present a public key that was 400    digits long would take existing computers longer than the    age of the universe to crack. But it remains to be proved    in a rigorous mathematical way that no systematic    short-cut exists. Indeed, some types of numbers are easy    to factorise, and RSA schemes must avoid these known    softies. It may yet turn out that, even if factorising is    hard in general (as mathematicians suspect, after    centuries of trying), there is a sneaky way, in the case    of some other types of numbers, to do it quickly.    This would be bad luck if you chose such a number.    Private users may not care much: it is unlikely that    someone who discovered such a loophole would use it for    anything so modest as unscrambling credit card numbers.    But governments, whose secrets are worth a lot more, are    always on the lookout for better cloaks to go with their    daggers. The ultimate cryptographic feat would therefore    be a mathematical proof that all choices of a particular    problem useful in code-making are forever intractable.    Nobody is that clever yet. But Miklos Ajtai, a    mathematician at the IBM Almaden Research Centre in San    Jose, California, has made progress with puzzles called    "lattice reductions". If you pick any such problem using    his guidelines, it is -- unlike a factorisation problem    -- guaranteed to be just as thorny as the most difficult    one imaginable. Since many mathematicians also suspect    that the toughest lattice-reduction problem is almost    impossible to crack, Dr Ajtai's proof, completed in May,    increases the confidence that they would all make good    wrappings for secret messages.    For mathematical aesthetes, lattice problems have more    panache than the dull numerals of factorisation. Instead    of factorising, say, a 200-digit number, a lattice    reduction invites the would-be codebreaker to deduce the    most basic way a pattern repeats itself in a piece of    200-dimensional decorative wallpaper. This is every bit    as hard as it sounds.    To describe a repeating pattern of rows and columns of    flowers on an ordinary piece of wallpaper, two "arrows"    suffice. Each points from one flower to a nearby one. If    you start with a wall which is blank, except for one    flower, you can reconstruct the entire design with the    arrows: lay the ends of the arrows on the flower and draw    new flowers (with new arrows) at each arrowtip. Repeat    the process with the new flowers and the wall will    eventually be full.    Although the obvious pair of arrows to choose in this    case would be at right angles to each other (eg, pointing    north and east) other pairs would also work: for example    north-east and east. But in this case the "north-east"    arrow would have to be longer to reach the centre of the    next flower than the "east" one. The puzzle is to find    the shortest set of arrows that can be used to replicate    the pattern -- easy in two or three dimensions, but    achingly complex in the higher-dimensional spaces that    the imaginations of mathematicians inhabit. By the time    the pattern has 200 dimensions, today's fastest computers    would be unable to find the 200 smallest arrows    describing an arbitrary pattern before the sun ran out of    fuel. Yet, as with two prime numbers, it is easy to begin    with those arrows and produce the design.    But how do you hide a secret message, accessible only    with a private key, in a publicly available lattice?    Shafi Goldwasser, Oded Goldreich and Shai Halevi, of the    Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Weizmann    Institute, in Israel, have just proposed a way. In order    to encode a line of digits, they first interpret them as    coordinates for a point in the lattice. Then they mix up    the numbers by nudging that point a tiny random amount    into the empty space between lattice points. To retrieve    the original number, an eavesdropper would need to find    the way back to the nearest lattice point, which is    almost -- but not quite equivalent to knowing its    shortest arrows.    The trouble with it being not quite equivalent is that    the encoding scheme changes the problem slightly --    enough for it to fall just outside the range of Dr    Ajtai's proof that any instance of his lattice scheme is    as hard to solve as the most difficult one.    There is hope that the proof can be extended to include    the encryption scheme, or that the scheme can be modified    to fit the proof. But a proof that nobody could ever    invent a quick method to solve the toughest lattice    reduction would be nicer still -- except that its    inventor would put fellow code-breakers out of work. A    cryptographer who invented such a system might well be    tempted to keep it secret.    [Graphic of wallpaper omitted]    [End]

A prime number, for those of us who    have forgotten grade school mathematics, can only be    divided by itself and by 1. Smaller primes include 2, 3, 5,    7 and 11. The new one, 2^1257787-1, is a bit bigger.    Printed out, the 378,632 digit number would take up 12    newspaper pages. "We're pretty confident that this is the    largest known prime number," said researcher Paul Gage.    There are an infinite number of primes but they are    extremely difficult to find. The newly discovered prime    number is of a type known a "Mersenne" prime, named for a    17th century French monk and mathematician. It is easier to    prove the prime-ness of Mersenne numbers than other primes,    thanks to complex mathematical software.    Cray runs the prime-testing program to search for bugs in    its new supercomputers. Gage said the discovery of the    prime was a happy byproduct of the process. The new number    was discovered during a six-hour run testing a new Cray T94    system.    Prime numbers are useful in the field of cryptography,    where they are used to help construct virtually unbreakable    codes. The new prime is far larger than those commonly    used. Said Gage, "A cryptographer interested in numbers    this big wouldn't be talking about it."    -- John Schwartz    [End]

Science, 30 August 1996:    "Enforcing Coherent Evolution in Dissipative Quantum    Dynamics"    Cirac, Pellizzari, Zoller       [Precis] The major obstacle to the preparation and       manipulation of many-particle entangled states is       decoherence due to the coupling of the system to the       environment. A scheme to correct for the effects of       decoherence and enforce coherent evolution in the       system dynamics is described and illustrated for the       particular case of the ion-trap quantum computer.    The preparation and manipulation of N-particle entangled    states is fundamental to the investigation of basic    aspects of quantum mechanics and is the basis of    applications such as quantum computation, teleportation,    cryptography. and spectroscopy.    The error correction schemes proposed so far have focused    on preserving a given entangled state (memory errors). We    introduce a method to correct for the effects of    decoherence in the dynamical proccss of preparation and    modification of entangled states (gate errors). We    illustrate our scheme in the context of the ion-trap QC.    -----    This 4-page paper is packed with equations. We will scan    to JPEG for those without access to Science.

FiTi, 10 September 1996.    Call to abolish banking secrecy    By William Lewis in Cambridge    The UK government should take a lead and abolish banking    secrecy in its dependent territory offshore centres, a    former legal adviser to MI5 and MI6, the British    intelligence agencies, said yesterday.    Mr David Bickford, the first British intelligence lawyer    to speak publicly in the UK, said at a conference in    Cambridge, 50 miles north-east of London, that there    "appears to be no justification at all for offshore bank    secrecy other than to protect the criminal".    He said "offshore bank secrecy can and must be abolished"    and "the UK should be the first to abolish this secrecy    given their control of their dependent territory offshore    centres".    Mr Bickford, who now runs an international legal    consultancy, said "endemic corruption" is caused by    offshore secrecy, and it is "difficult to see why it is    tolerated by any other than those with an unlawful    disposition".    He said allowing countries to maintain offshore banking    secrecy is "a classic example of the corruptive influence    of organised crime".    Mr Bickford added that the "justification is put forward    at all is an example of the overwhelming subversive    corruptive influence of organised crime which has managed    to magic a seemingly acceptable position out of the sheer    weight of its financial proceeds from narcotics, fraud,    extortion and other criminal enterprise".    Mr Raymond Kendall, secretary general of Interpol told    the 14th International Symposium on Economic Crime that    governments should commit more resources and step up    co-operation to tackle the growing problem of    international corruption.

Nikkei English News, 24 September 1996.    Mitsubishi unveils Japan's fastest encryption chip     Mitsubishi Electric Corp. said it has developed an LSI    that can encrypt data at a speed of 450 megabits per    second, which is four times faster than any other    encryption chip developed in Japan and brings domestic    technology in line with DES, the U.S.-developed    encryption system that has become the standard in the    U.S. and Europe.    Because the chip performs the same as DES, Mitsubishi    will promote it as a domestic product for encryption    needs in Japan, with an eye on the growing market for    corporate intranets and high-speed data communications.    It said it will prepare for volume production during this    year.    The company fabricated the chip as a gate array using a    0.5 micron CMOS process and its own proprietary    encryption algorithm MISTY. Operating at a maximum    input/output speed of 40 megahertz, the chip can handle    32 bits per clock cycle.    [End]

Adding to the CWD wiretap alarm by Brock and Declan:    The Washington Post, September 26, 1996, p. A30.    Wiretaps and Money Bills [Editorial]    Legislators who have pet projects but not enough support to    get them passed have a way of turning desperate during the    closing days of the congressional session. Their thoughts    turn ineluctably to unrelated appropriations bills. Only    last week, Rep. Frank Wolf used the transportation funding    bill as a vehicle for usurping the courts' role in a    specific domestic relations dispute. Now senators working    on the Commerce, State and Justice appropriations bill have    slipped in provisions relating to wiretaps that have been    before the Congress for 18 months but have not been    adopted. The law should not be changed by means of these    stealthy riders.    One of the substantive changes in the criminal laws ordered    by the money committee, for example, would make it easier    to obtain court orders authorizing "roving" wiretaps. This    would permit putting taps on any phone a suspect might use    -- including unspecified public phones -- without    requiring, as the law now does, that the government show    that the suspect is attempting to thwart a home or office    tap by repeatedly changing phones. This may or may not be    reasonable, but Congress considered and rejected it earlier    this year. It shouldn't be shoved through on an    appropriations bill.    The committee bill also increased the number of crimes for    which a wiretap can be issued, adding a list of new,    relatively imprecise offenses related to terrorism such as    "providing material support to terrorists" and "terrorist    acts transcending national borders." Taps already are    allowed for just about every major crime in which a    terrorist might engage, including bombing, arson, murder,    kidnapping, extortion, espionage, sabotage, treason,    hostage-taking and the destruction of trains ships,    aircraft and aircraft facilities. What, then, is the reason    for adding these new elastic terms, which could include far    less serious offenses that someone thinks might be linked    to terrorism? The committees that dealt with the subject in    April did not see fit to do so. Why now has the    Appropriations Committee intervened?    The competing values of security and privacy rights require    a much better sorting out. It's best done by people who    have had the benefit of relevant testimony and experience.    The appropriations committees are the wrong setting to deal    with such questions, which should not be presented in a    take-it-or-leave-it package with the government's continued    operation at stake.

The New York Times, October 1, 1996, pp. D1, D2.    Accord Near On Computer Security Codes       'Key' System Required For Law Enforcement    By David E. Sanger    Washington, Sept. 30 -- After several years of debate    between the computer industry and American intelligence    agencies, President Clinton has decided to permit American    computer companies to export more powerful data-scrambling    software but only if they establish a system that will    enable keys to the code to be obtained by law enforcement    officials with a court warrant.    Administration officials, speaking on the condition of    anonymity, said Mr. Clinton reached his decision late last    week and that Vice President Al Gore would announce it on    Wednesday or Thursday.    Several big computer companies, led by the I.B.M., have    agreed to the new system, but many others, which have    opposed past proposals by the Administration for data-    scrambling policies, are likely to object.    Many American computer and software executives have long    argued that United States export controls on the most    sophisticated data-privacy technology put American industry    at a disadvantage versus products sold by their foreign    competitors.    But the Clinton White House, like previous Administrations,    citing national security issues and fears of foreign    terrorists or criminals, is loath to permit the export of    some of the most powerful data-scrambling software. The    reason has chiefly been that intelligence agencies feared    such equipment would be used by foreign terrorists, drug    cartels and other criminals to hide transactions and    communications.    Now, in a compromise, according to two senior officials in    the Administration who have been deeply involved in the new    policy, American companies will be permitted on Jan. 1 to    export software that encrypts, or scrambles, data using    "keys" -- lengthy numeric codes -- that are up to 56 bits    long. Until now, companies have been prohibited from    selling products abroad that have keys longer than 40 bits.    Mr. Clinton has also decided to move the authority for    exporting the encryption software from the State    Department, which has had export-licensing authority    because the technology has been classified as munitions, to    the Commerce Department, which controls the export of    products that have both commercial and military use.    Industry officials have long urged that change, betting the    Commerce Department would be more inclined to give a higher    priority to American competitive interests.    But starting in two years, American companies choosing to    export the more sophisticated software would have to set up    what the industry is calling a "key recovery" system. That    system would enable intelligence officials and law    enforcement agents, armed with court warrants, to go    through a lengthy multi-step process that would give them    the mathematical key to decoding scrambled communications.    The approach replaces the Administration's earlier proposed    "key escrow" system in which the Government would have been    the repository of the numeric keys -- leading to fears of    potential Government abuse, or a reluctance by legitimate    foreign users to buy the software.    Under the new plan, the keys may be held by third-party    companies. And large institutions, like banks may be    allowed to hold their keys in escrow -- assuming they pass    some kind of Government certification.    Still, the success of the system will depend on large part    on the Administration's efforts to persuade other countries    to adopt the same "key recovery" system, allowing their    intelligence agencies and justice systems to cooperate in    trailing criminals across national borders. But Mr.    Clinton's aides acknowledged today that this process has    just begun, and so far only England and France have    expressed much enthusiasm.    "It is going to take a while to persuade people that their    data is safe under this system, that it protects privacy,    and yet that we can use the system to trace terrorists or    drug dealers," one senior Administration official said.    Officials at I.B.M., which is expected to announce on    Wednesday the creation of an industry consortium to aid in    establishing the "key recovery" system, said today that no    single entity would hold the entire key.    Instead, it will be divided up across several companies    that would handle any given message, much the way the    launching officials in nuclear missile silos each had only    part of the key instructions needed to begin a nuclear    attack.    If the C.I.A., for example, obtained a court order to    decode a message, it would have to go to several groups    with its warrant to piece together the key.    "We believe that this solves the, biggest weak point in the    previous plans, where one entity held the key," said an    I.B.M. official familiar with the company's announcement.    But these steps are not likely to silence all the critics.    "There is still a perception that the U.S. is trying to    extend its intelligence capability by setting standards    around the world," said Marc Rotenberg, director of the    Electronic Privacy Information Center.    There are other potential holes in the system. Customers in    the United States will be free to buy encryption software    of any complexity -- as they can today -- with keys that    are much longer than 56 bits and are nearly impossible to    break. That means terrorist groups or drug dealers could    still buy such software and sneak it out of the country, or    even transmit it over computer networks.    "There is nothing we can do about bright students or Joe    Terrorist who use sophisticated encryption systems to    communicate with each other," one senior administration    official said. "But when they brush up against legitimate    groups, especially banks," the official said, "then they    are more likely to be dealing with a system" where law    enforcement could use the key recovery system to decode the    communications.    On Capitol Hill, several bills had been pending that would    lift all export controls on encryption software, but the    legislation did not move as the current session of Congress    wound down. In Congressional testimony last week, Jamie S.    Gorelick, Deputy Attorney General, said lifting all export    controls would "undermine our leadership role in fighting    international crime and damage our own national security    interests."

The New York Times, October 2, 1996, pp. D1, D8.    Compromise Is Offered on Computer Security Codes    By John Markoff    The Clinton Administration offered a compromise to the    computer industry yesterday by holding out the possibility    of removing all export restrictions on data-scrambling    technology for companies that accept a new approach to    allow law enforcement officials to unscramble coded    messages. The new system is being recommended by an    alliance led by I.B.M..    The approach is to be announced today and has passed muster    with the Central Intelligence Agency. It would enable law    enforcement officials to unscramble computer communications    -- provided they have a warrant -- without having to obtain    a mathematical key to the code.    Instead, the agents could use the warrant to obtain the    cooperation of outside parties to help unscramble portions    of code accompanying a message. This information would then    allow law enforcement officials to draw mathematical    inferences enabling them to decipher the scrambled    messages.    By making it at least a two-step process to decipher a    scrambled, or encrypted, message, and by requiring the    cooperation of at least two outside parties designated by    the code users themselves, the approach is supposed to    address the main criticisms against data-scrambling systems    previously endorsed by the Government.    But some industry executives and privacy-rights advocates    said yesterday that the new approach would not satisfy    their objections to a Government-backed eavesdropping    system. Critics contend that any such system could    compromise the privacy of United States citizens and hinder    the ability of American high-technology companies to sell    their most sophisticated data-security products overseas.    Executives of the International Business Machines    Corporation said late yesterday that they were still lining    up the final list of companies in the alliance. Those    involved will include Digital Equipment and smaller    data-security companies including RSA Data Security, Cylink    and Trusted Information Systems.    The computer industry and the Clinton Administration, as    well as factions within the Administration, have been at an    impasse for years over export policy for data-scrambling    technology. Intelligence and law enforcement agencies,    fearing that such technology can be used by terrorists and    criminals to conspire with impunity, have insisted on a    system for cracking the coded messages under certain    circumstances.    Seeking to end the deadlock, I.B.M. set in motion the new    compromise earlier this year when it demonstrated its    experimental approach to the C.I.A. Director, John Deutsch.    Mr. Deutsch then took an active role in the internal    Administration debate, in which Justice Department and    F.B.I. officials had previously taken a hard line against    loosening export controls, according to several people    familiar with the talks.    In a public statement issued yesterday Vice President Al    Gore said that if the I.B.M. data-deciphering technology    proved workable, there would no longer be export    restrictions on the strength of the data-scrambling    technology or on the type of software algorithms -- or    mathematical formulas -- employed.    The Administration is calling the I.B.M. approach a "key    recovery" system. The designation is meant to distinguish    it from previously proposed "key escrow" systems, like one    called Clipper that the Government put forth a few years    ago.    In an escrow system, one or more Government or    private-industry escrow agents would hold keys for    unlocking coded messages, which could be used by    law-enforcement agents with a warrant. The drawbacks,    according to I.B.M., are that the storage of the keys can    become a record-keeping nightmare and can also make the    system vulnerable to unauthorized use of the keys.    The I.B.M. approach is intended to eliminate this    vulnerability by giving no third party an actual key to the    code. Instead, at least two "trusted agents" would be    required to help unscramble encrypted information in the    header of each message. Only after this portion of the    message is deciphered, I.B.M. said, would law-enforcement    agents be able to unscramble the contents of the message    itself by recreating the original key to the code.    "Our theory is this should work the same way as your filing    cabinet," said Kathy Kincaid, an I.B.M. computer security    executive. "You wouldn't give law enforcement the keys to    your filing cabinet unless they had a search warrant."    And yet, even one of the companies that I.B.M. is counting    on as an alliance member said yesterday that new approach    did not go far enough beyond the old Clipper plan, in terms    of privacy protection.    "The Government announcement is disastrous," said Jim    Bidzos, chief executive of RSA Data Security, one of the    country's leading developers of data-scrambling software.    "We warned I.B.M. that the National Security Agency would    try to twist their technology."    The Clinton Administration also angered executives at the    software company Netscape Communications, who warned that    even the new Government plan would continue to hinder the    American industry's ability to compete internationally.    Peter Harter, Netscape's public-policy lawyer, contended    that the Administration was playing favorites among    computer companies, rewarding those willing to go along    with its approach by removing export restrictions that    might be retained for companies not willing to incorporate    the "key recovery" system in their products.    "This is tantamount to making public policy by extorting    high-tech companies," Mr. Harter said.    But some computer hardware makers were more conciliatory.    "From my perspective the process has been much better this    time," said Eric Schmitt, Sun Microsystem's chief    technology officer. "The question is still, 'How will    industry implement key recovery?' It's still too early to    say."    [End]

C|NET, October 2, 1996, 1:45 p.m. PT    Computer alliance supports encryption policy     By Alex Lash    An alliance of 11 software and hardware companies has    just announced its formation to develop key-recovery    solutions for electronic encryption, a crucial component    of the Clinton administration's latest plan to loosen the    export of encryption technology.    Announced yesterday, the administration's plan gives    exporters of encryption or encrypted software a two-year    window starting January 1, 1997, to build what the    administration calls "key recovery" into their products.    IBM, Apple Computer, Atalla, Digital Equipment, Groupe    Bull, Hewlett-Packard, NCR, RSA Data Security, Sun    Microsystems, Trusted Information Systems, and United    Parcel Service have banded together to develop systems    that will give the government what it wants, which is    access to suspicious encrypted messages, so that    compliant software companies will be able to get export    licenses for hard-to-crack encryption codes.     "Export controls are a fact of life," RSA President Jim    Bidzos said today. "In an imperfect world this technique    will at least allow you to take advantage of what    governments around the world will allow."     RSA's presence in the alliance is not only a coup for the    government but a big surprise, as Bidzos has been one of    the most vocal opponents of the Clinton administration's    key escrow efforts. He has even accused the government of    offering software companies special "sweetheart" deals to    gain support for its encryption regulation plans.    A key-recovery plan not only satisfies the government's    desire for court-ordered access to encrypted messages,    but also sets off alarm bells for privacy advocates and    civil libertarians. Some within the U.S. software    industry also claim they won't be able to sell encrypted    products overseas if customers know the U.S. government    has access to a skeleton key.     "While some companies might choose to cast their lot with    the government's key-escrow policy, the marketplace is    likely to reject the approved products," said David    Sobel, legal counsel for the Electronic Privacy    Information Center. "Users want strong security, not    guaranteed government access to their communications."    However, the concept of key recovery is not anathema to    companies that acknowledge that firms and folks using    encryption to secure electronic transactions and    communications will need backup copies of their keys,    just as homeowners keep an extra house key under a flower    pot.    Under the new government plan, a company that promises to    participate in key recovery will receive a six-month    license to export up to 56-bit DES encryption. When the    promise is fulfilled and the government can get access to    the decryption keys, the 56-bit limit is lifted. If by    the end of the two-year grace period the company has not    fulfilled its promise to implement a key-recovery scheme,    the 56-bit limit is dropped back down to the current    40-bit limit.    "The fact that 56-bit DES [a type of encryption] will be    available from significant sources is going to jump-start    electronic commerce," said Ken Kay, executive director of    the Computer Systems Policy Project, a public policy    group comprised of 12 computer industry CEOs.     Now that the details are out and endorsements are coming    in, executive action is expected in the next two to three    weeks, according to one senior administration official.    President Clinton will soon sign an executive order that    transfers jurisdiction over encryption export licenses    from the State Department to the Commerce Department, a    move that the computer industry has asked for in the past    because they see Commerce as a more sympathetic agency.    At the same time, Commerce will announce a new set of    streamlined rules to grant companies a "fast track" to an    export license if they comply with key recovery, the    official said.    Commerce plans to begin licensing on January 1.    But the new plan will also give the Justice Department a    voice in the licensing process, a detail that angers    privacy advocates and software companies alike.     "The transfer from State to Commerce has been called for    for a long time, but a small tweak is that the FBI now    has veto power," said Peter Harter, legal counsel to    Netscape Communications. "Domestic law enforcement    shouldn't have a seat at the table."     Harter acknowledged that Netscape has not ruled out key    recovery but said that the market must show demand for    it. The administration has said it hopes to introduce a    bill next spring that would encourage the build-up of key    recovery by establishing laws on the conduct of    third-party key holders. But it will not try to mandate    key recovery through legislation.     "I think we have a critical mass of companies willing to    work with us," said Heidi Kukis, spokesperson for the    Vice President's office. "That would make legislation to    mandate key recovery very unlikely."     Another fear is that the administration is using export    limits to control domestic use of encryption. While Gore    directly stated yesterday that domestic use of encryption    will remain unregulated, the double standard for domestic    and international products might discourage U.S.    companies from developing two different versions, leaving    U.S. and Canadian customers with the same products that    the federal government has deemed safe to ship overseas.     "We obtained and intend to hold the administration to its    assurances that export controls would not be used to    control domestic use," said Kay of the CSPP. "The CEOs    have told the administration that if they want to do    domestic controls, they should do it frontally through    the democratic process and introduce legislation."     [End]

The New York Times, October 4, 1996, p. A32.    A Flawed Encryption Policy [Editorial]    The new White House proposal to keep high-powered    encryption software out of the hands of foreign terrorists    and criminals is needlessly restrictive and probably    unworkable. Though the new plan is better than previous    Administration proposals, it risks doing more harm than    good.    The Administration is rightly worried that foreign    terrorists or criminals will get hold of encryption    software that will make it impossible for the Government to    eavesdrop on their telephone and computer messages. The    technology is legal in this country, but the Administration    wants to keep the powerful new software out of foreign    hands.    However, the Administration downplays the fact that    encryption is also a good way for honest citizens to    prevent crime. At a time when banks and other private    companies send vast amounts of confidential information    over the electronic highway, it would seem sensible to make    high-quality encryption widely available so that the    private sector can protect itself from criminal or    malicious eavesdropping. For that reason, the Government    ought to promote wide-scale dissemination of encryption,    both here and abroad.    Trying to block dissemination is probably useless and    almost certainly harmful to American exports. Powerful    encryption systems made by foreign companies are already    available in Europe and Asia, and American exporters will    need to sell state-of-the-art software to keep competitive.    The Clinton Administration previously proposed that the    computer industry adopt a single type of encryption, known    as key-escrow, which would scramble messages with    mathematical passwords. Under the plan, private companies    and individuals would turn over these passwords to the    Government, which, with court authorization, could use them    to unscramble the phone and computer traffic. The purpose    of key-escrow, then, would be to preserve the Government's    existing ability to tap phone calls.    But that Clinton plan was firmly rejected by industry and    privacy-rights advocates who feared that a government that    held passwords would abuse First Amendment prohibitions    against listening in on private communications. The latest    White House plan addresses many of these concerns. It would    impose restrictions only on the software that exporters    sell abroad. Privacy advocates have less to fear from the    latest plan because it would allow individuals to deposit    their passwords with private organizations, rather than the    Government.    Yet the Administration has not explained why foreigners    would buy American software that would allow the F.B.I. to    eavesdrop when they could buy equally powerful software    from non-American manufacturers that omits any such trap    door. Critics assume that foreign governments -- few of    which pay attention to American constitutional protections    against invasion of privacy -- would demand access to    passwords, making such software unattractive for anyone to    use.    There is room to improve the plan. A panel of the National    Research Council recently concluded that there is no good    reason to restrict exports of currently available    encryption because foreigners already have access to    equally powerful software. There is time to work out    restrictions, in cooperation with the industry and privacy    advocates, for the next generation of encryption software.    In the meantime the Administration might push forward on    the panel's other sensible recommendations -- such as    developing better encryption expertise within the F.B.I.    and helping the private sector develop the encryption    software it needs to stop illegal eavesdropping.

The Washington Post, October 4, 1996, p. A22.    Crypto Politics [Editorial]    The Clinton administration once had a coherent, if    unpopular, position on encryption software, the stuff that    allows you to encode your email messages or other data so    that no one can read it en route without a key. Now, in the    wake of word that the president will sign an executive    order, the position is no longer coherent, nor discernibly    more popular with the high-tech audience it attempts to    mollify.    People and companies doing international financial business    are highly interested in this kind of software, the more    powerfully "uncrackable" the better. The U.S. software    industry thinks there's a lot of money in it, especially if    encryption becomes routine.    The administration position till recently was that, much as    U.S. software companies might profit from being able to    market "uncrackable" encryption software freely, national    security and law enforcement considerations dictated that    such exports be controlled by license. Powerful encryption,    like arms, could be dangerous in the hands of terrorists,    rogue governments or international criminals. The software    was classed as a munition; software above a certain    uncrackability level could not be exported unless law    enforcement authorities could get access somehow to the    "key" after obtaining the proper warrants.    Unbreakable codes on the loose strike us as a real danger,    a legitimate reason for tight export controls. But if the    administration really believes this, you'd think it would    stick with steps that can plausibly meet the goal of    control.    Instead, trying to please, it has been splitting and    splitting the difference between itself and the largely    unmoved industry, which argues that no one will buy an    encryption product that a government can decrypt at will.    As with arms sales, the companies also argue that if they    don't sell it, somebody else will, and that anyway it's far    too late to fence off rogues. The national security people    respond that there is still a "window," perhaps two years,    in which they can prevent, if not all leaks of unauthorized    crypto technology, at least its off-the-shelf use and wide    adoption as the international standard.    The administration initially proposed, then repeatedly    refined, the concept of key "escrow" -- depositing a copy    of the code with trusted third parties -- but never came up    with a version the industry would accept. It commissioned    a National Research Council report, which recommended a    significant easing of restrictions. Now the president    appears to have embraced a yet looser form of licensure    upon declaration by a company that it will develop a plan    within two years for key recovery. Also, the technology no    longer will be considered munitions.    What kind of plan? Nobody can quite say. What if the plans    aren't acceptable? Licensing will revert to the old rule in    two years. Will the security issue be moot by then?    Probably. Barring some burst of clarity, one is left    wondering whether the administration has compromised or    caved, and what it now believes about the dangers of    exporting uncrackable software.

10-03-96 at 19:09 EDT, American Banker    Banks Like Export Plan for High-Power Encryption     By Drew Clark    -----    "Banks have really taken a leadership role in the    responsible management of cryptography," said a senior    Clinton administration official who asked not to be    named. "Banks are already doing what we want other    organizations to do: safeguarding their keys and    providing them, when necessary, to law enforcement."    "Providing 56-bit encryption with key recovery doesn't    help us," said Netscape spokeswoman Chris Holton. "The    government is saying that you can export it but you have    to provide us with the keys. We feel that is extortion on    the part of the government."    "We are making the best of a bad situation," said Scott    Schnell, vice president of marketing for RSA Data    Security.    -----    Bank technology experts have reacted favorably to the    Clinton administration's proposal to liberalize the    development and sale of strong data security tools.    This week, the government said it would lift export    restrictions on certain kinds of cryptography, provided    U.S. companies agree to cooperate with a procedure that    would give law enforcement officials access to the "keys"    of such codes, upon presentation of a warrant.    Banks were heartened by the announcement because many    view the widely used Data Encryption Standard - a    low-level form of data scrambling - as inadequate    protection against the rising computer power of so-called    hackers.    Though banks can use a complex 56-bit data encryption key    for financial transactions, sensitive communications with    overseas branches are limited to a less powerful 40-bit    standard.    Banks hope that a loosening of restrictions in general    will benefit them, too.    "This policy announcement is better than anyone    expected," said Kawika M. Daguio, federal representative    at the American Bankers Association in Washington. "It is    gravy for us, but it's the meat and potatoes for the    hardware and software industries."    "Banks probably won't be adversely affected," said    Stewart A. Baker, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson, a    Washington law firm, "and they will be left pretty much    where they were before."    The announcement by Vice President Al Gore said that    controls over powerful encryption technology would be    lifted as the government and private sector develop a    "key recovery" system. (International Business Machines    Corp. already has stepped forward to head a consortium    dedicated to creating such a system.)    Current law forbids the export of computer hardware or    software that uses cryptographic codes with digital    "keys" - randomly generated combinations of 0's and 1's -    longer than 40 bits. The longer the key length, the more    impenetrable the code.    For three years, the government has said it would permit    the general use of more complex cryptography only if the    companies using it placed their keys in the hands of the    government or a third party.    "Key escrow," as it is known in the technical community,    is needed in order to prosecute people who have stored    evidence of illegal activity on the hard drive of a    computer, officials argued.    But the private sector - banks included - have balked at    handing over such access to any third party.    The disagreement gave rise to a compromise system known    as "key recovery" in which companies would hold their own    keys but could be required to divulge certain information    about specific transactions when presented with a court    order or warrant.    "What is novel is that it doesn't escrow any keys," said    Homayoon Tajalli, executive vice president of Trusted    Information Systems, Glenwood, Md., one of IBM's    consortium partners.    "If the government comes and gets this data with a court    order," explained Mr. Tajalli, "then they take a digital    lockbox from the third party or parties that hold it, and    they read the message."    Kathy Kincaid, director of information technology for    IBM, said the difference between key escrow and key    recovery is analogous to the following approach to    securing a house when its owner goes on vacation: Instead    of giving a key to two neighbors, the owner gives each    neighbor half the combination to a lockbox that holds the    key.    "You must have both halves and put them together in    exactly the right sequence," said Ms. Kincaid. "This    provides protection against a single point of attack."    Companies participating in development of key recovery    systems include: Apple Computer Inc., Digital Equipment    Corp., Groupe Bull, Hewlett-Packard Co., NCR Corp., RSA    Data Security, Sun Microsystems Inc., Trusted Information    Systems, and United Parcel Service.    And a government official said banks may even play a    role.    "Banks have really taken a leadership role in the    responsible management of cryptography," said a senior    Clinton administration official who asked not to be    named. "Banks are already doing what we want other    organizations to do: safeguarding their keys and    providing them, when necessary, to law enforcement."    Heidi Kukis, a spokeswoman for Vice President Gore, said:    "This key recovery system is the proper balance between    commercial interests and national security."    But not all agree. Some argue that the key recovery    system still gives the government too much control over    information flow.    "Providing 56-bit encryption with key recovery doesn't    help us," said Netscape spokeswoman Chris Holton. "The    government is saying that you can export it but you have    to provide us with the keys. We feel that is extortion on    the part of the government."    "We are making the best of a bad situation," said Scott    Schnell, vice president of marketing for RSA Data    Security.    "The bottom line is that the standard proposed by the    government is an insubstantial step in the right    direction," he said. "We want to make sure it is usable    and prepare for the day that products will be available    that do not have this key recovery situation."    The government's announcement came three months after a    National Research Council report on the role of    cryptography in an information-oriented society.    The report encouraged liberalization of government    standards and questioned the feasibility of the key    escrow system then favored by government.    "We raised the issue about the security of key escrow    systems," said law professor Kenneth W. Dam, chairman of    the body that prepared the report, "and we said the    government should work on it."    "I take it this is an attempt to move in the way of key    escrow, with the help of industry," said Mr. Dam.    [End]

introduce new controls, develop policies and procedures
specific to the company's identified risks, and plan an
implementation schedule. The end result is a prevention
system, protected under attorney/client privilege, that
meets or exceeds OSHA and legal standards and provides a
structured management response to threats or acts of
violence that is both psychologically and legally sound.
          Threats of Violence/Crisis Response Training:
Hands-on facilitation prepares management, TOV teams, and
selected employees for potentially violent situations. The
program covers prediction, prevention, and defusing hot
threats of violence as well as aggression management and
post-crisis response. Practical case studies based on actual
experience are included.
          Post-incident Crisis Intervention: Available 24
hours a day, CMI has the worlds largest network of crisis
psychologists who are trained and experienced in corporate
crisis and disaster intervention. We provide reliable and
effective services to deal with any level of traumatic
incident. Crisis Management International has handled
hundreds of corporate crises from small to large, including
the World Trade Center bombing, Oklahoma City Federal
Building bombing, Hurricane Andrew, Los Angeles and San
Francisco earthquakes, commercial and corporate airplane
crashes, workplace murders and assaults, explosions and
other industrial accidents.
          Psych-Claims Management: CMI offers analysis and
strategy for all psychological injury litigation and
workers' comp claims. CMI's affiliate company, Claims
Management International, provides support services for the
defense in disputing claims, including Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD) and closed-head injuries.
          SCAN: CMI offers a proven method of detection
deception without the restrictions associated with the
employee polygraph. SCAN is an extensive analysis of a
person's spoken or written words. This methodology can be
applied to sexual harassment cases, hot threats of violence,
sabotage, shrinkage, or any situation in which deception is
suspected and your company needs to know the truth.
          SCAN: Scientific Content Analysis
How SCAN Works
SCAN is an established and reliable method for obtaining
information and detecting deception from written or spoken
statements. What distinguishes SCAN from other interrogative
processes is that it first seeks to clear subjects who are
exhibiting truthful linguistic behavior. Other processes
usually operate on the assumption that all subjects have
something to hide. In SCAN, only those subjects who exhibit
inconsistencies within sentence structure, ..., and
sequences of events are labeled as problematic by the
analyst. When there ... a few of these inconsistencies, the
analyst tallies the evidence that shows the subject ...
being deceptive, or that he or she is showing sensitivity
about a certain topic. This sensitivity is a sign that the
subject is not giving the full story.
Who uses SCAN?
This methodology is employed by intelligence, investigative,
and law enforcement agencies around the world. But it is
also very useful in most areas of business and law. SCAN can
help you any time your company needs to know the truth. SCAN
is not like most interrogation techniques which are usually
invasive and confrontational. This would not be suitable for
a business setting. Whereas traditional techniques require
that an interviewer ask questions while the subject gives
short, rather uninformative answers, the collections of
material for SCAN linguistic analysis requires that the
subject talk or write at some length to give their side of
the story. This non-threatening manner of obtaining a pure
version of the subject's account yields much more material
to analyze and a greater likelihood of finding any
linguistic cues that indicate deception.
Businesses of all kinds may find themselves experiencing
threats of violence, sexual harassment cases, sabotage,
internal and external theft (shrinkage), conspiracy, and
white-collar crime. SCAN analysis helps to determine if a
seemingly threatening individual really means what they are
saying. It also helps to decide whether to believe someone
when they say they had "nothing to do with it."
Insurance companies process millions of fraudulent claims
each year, which are often settled even though the claims
adjusters have reasonable suspicions that the claims are not
legitimate. While it is impossible to catch every instance
of fraud, it is possible - and worthwhile - to have the
largest claims examined. CMI is experienced in managing
claims of all sizes and offers SCAN analysis as an adjunct
service to help obtain the whole story behind the claim.
Attorneys are naturally good at digging for information -
but it is sometimes difficult to know exactly where to dig.
A CMI analyst, present at a deposition, can discreetly
indicate to counsel where a witness may be leaving out
potentially important information. If a completed deposition
is already on file, an analyst can check witness' statements
for consistency and truthfulness, which allows for better
preparation for court or for an easy settlement. For times
when an insurance or claim comes to suit, SCAN can determine
if CMI's Claims Management Services may benefit the case.
CMI's SCAN Technology:
     is a comprehensive structuring of several techniques
and methodologies. As utilized by CMI, SCAN serves as the
foundation on which linguistic analysis can be built,
supplemented by CMI-developed technologies that include
linguistic "credibility" analysis, principles of logic,
tenets of Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP), and
interviewing/interrogation techniques.
     is used in behalf of its client companies to:
     a. Detect deception      b. Assist in dangerousness assessments      c. Clear the innocent in situations where there are             numerous persons who had both access and         opportunity (such as sabotage, shrinkage, etc.).
     d. Provide a sufficient basis of "reasonable         suspicion" as required for polygraph.
     offers benefits/advantages of SCAN over other methods;
interpreting physical indicators of deception is subjective,
at best. Further, body and eye movements (and most global
indicators) vary among cultures, making accurate
interpretation even more inexact. SCAN analyzes only     the subject's words, making it completely unobtrusive and
much more objective. SCAN can be conducted even more
effectively through a questionnaire approach.
SCAN vs. Polygraph:
The use of lie detector apparatus (polygraph) on employees
is controlled by the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of
1988 (EPPA), Public Law 100-347. EPPA restrictions include
prohibitions on polygraph use, and specific notification
requirements. The EPPA does not prohibit or restrict
written "pen and paper" tests or screening. Therefore, SCAN
can be used as both a precursor to Polygraph or as a
replacement. Further, SCAN and SCAN questionnaires can
produce results comparable to (and in some instances better
than) polygraph. SCAN may produce the desired results
and completely replace the need for polygraph, and do so in
a much less accusatory environment.

Time, October 14, 1996, p. 78.
   The Netly News
   Joshua Quittner
   Big Brother vs. Cypherpunks
   For more than three years, the White House and the U.S.
   computer industry have sat locked, eyeball to eyeball, in
   a seemingly intractable face-off over who will control
   the secret codes that protect our most sensitive
   communications. The government claimed to be working to
   protect us from nuke-carrying terrorists; the computer
   industry said it was championing the individual's right
   to privacy. Neither was telling the whole truth.
   Last week, in a concession to Silicon Valley, the
   Administration blinked -- or perhaps it merely winked.
   Fittingly, in the arcane world of code making and
   breaking, it's difficult to ferret out who's doing what
   to whom. And why.
   A few things are incontrovertible. Vice President Al Gore
   announced the new encryption initiative at midweek, timed
   to coincide with support from an alliance of high-tech
   businesses that included such hardware heavyweights as
   IBM, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard. However, most
   of the big software makers --  and every civil liberties
   group -- still opposed it.
   At the core of the initiative is a new code-making scheme
   known as "key recovery." Here at last, the government and
   its supporters claimed, was a way to get around the more
   noxious aspects of the reviled Clipper chip, the
   Administration's first doomed attempt to balance the
   industry's call for stronger encryption with law
   enforcement's need to surveil our shadier citizens.
   Clipper, as proposed, would use a powerful encryption
   formula to encode communications sent over telephones and
   computer networks but would require that a "back door"
   key be built into each chip that would give police --
   where warranted, of course -- a means to eavesdrop.
   Nobody -- especially foreign companies -- liked the idea
   of the U.S. and its agents holding those keys. The new
   key-recovery proposal tries to get around that objection
   by chopping the keys into several pieces and storing them
   with "trusted agents" of the user's choosing. Some nice
   Swiss banks, perhaps.
   But the Administration's plan still falls short of what
   civil libertarians, and especially a vocal group of
   cryptoextremists who call themselves cypherpunks, say
   they need: encryption powerful enough to give back to the
   citizenry the right to absolute privacy, which we have
   lost in the information age. According to the
   cypherpunks, the so-called 56-bit code the Administration
   has okayed for export can be cracked by the National
   Security Agency's supercomputers in a matter of hours.
   Are they right? It's hard to know whom to believe in this
   cloak-and-dagger debate. Civil libertarians tend to gloss
   over the fact that the world is full of bad people with
   crimes to hide. The software industry -- which makes 48%
   of its profit overseas -- is clearly less concerned with
   privacy than with losing foreign sales. And it may be no
   accident that the Administration chose to start making
   concessions the same week an influential software CEO --
   Netscape's Jim Barksdale -- excoriated Clinton's
   cryptopolicy and endorsed Bob Dole.
   The issue is too complex -- and too important -- for
   political gamesmanship. It will never get sorted out
   until somebody starts playing it straight.

      Mitsubishi Electric Develops New Encryption System
   "MISTY", More Powerful Than DES (Data Encryption
   Standard) for Communication Networks
   -- Security Strictly Evaluated in World's First Practical
   Block Ciphers --
   Tokyo, October 27, 1995 -- Mitsubishi Electric has
   developed a new block cipher algorithm for an encryption
   system, which is essential technology for protecting the
   privacy of individuals and confidential information in
   communication networks, that makes both strength and
   speed compatible.
   The encryption algorithm is based on a cipher strength
   evaluation index, which applies the "linear
   cryptanalysis", a powerful decoding method unique to
   Mitsubishi Electric, and the "differential
   cryptanalysis", considered to be an effective decoding
   method next to the linear cryptanalysis. Mitsubishi
   Electric has succeeded in strictly evaluating the
   security of this encryption algorithm against these
   decoding methods.
   Background:    Using ciphers on wide-area networks requires a method to
   maintain security as long as its encryption key (password
   commonly shared by a sender and a receiver) is kept
   secret, even if the mechanism of the encryption is made
   public.
   However, possibilities of unauthorized access will
   increase when the encryption mechanism is made public. In
   fact, several encryption algorithms, whose specifications
   were made public, have been compelled to make
   specification changes, and to sacrifice their encryption
   speed in return for an increased cipher strength to
   protect against recent decoding methods. This is why an
   encryption system whose security against these decoding
   methods is strictly evaluated at the design stage has
   been required.
   Security of encryption is formulated as the lower limit
   of the number of calculations needed for decoding. A
   powerful decoding method leads to a stricter safety index
   in that it reduces the number of calculations needed for
   decoding.
   At present, the "linear cryptanalysis" is considered to
   be the most effective general-purpose decoding method. A
   decoding method called the "differential cryptanalysis"
   is another widely known decoding method next to the
   "linear cryptanalysis". A evaluation based on the linear
   and differential cryptanalysis is therefore considered to
   be the most reliable among strength indexes of block
   ciphers.*1
   *1 Block ciphers : Plain texts and cipher texts that are
   processed by being grouped into units called blocks; most
   widely used at present.
   Outline of Development:
   Since announcing the linear cryptanalysis, Mitsubishi
   Electric has been making efforts to develop encryption
   technology backed by adequate security. In January 1994,
   Mitsubishi Electric performed the first successful
   experiment to decode the Data Encryption Standard (DES),
   an American standard commercial encryption system, to
   quantitavely evaluate its strength using this linear
   cryptanalysis.
   Using this evaluation technology, Mitsubishi Electric has
   developed an encryption algorithm that quantitavely
   provides sufficient security to linear and differential
   cryptanalysis and achieves a practical encryption speed.
   The encryption algorithm can clarify the relationships
   between encryption speed and strength and allow users to
   use an encryption that meets their security needs.
   Mitsubishi Electric plans to develop software tool
   products and hardware products (LSIs) using this
   encryption algorithm. Mitsubishi Electric will make the
   specification of this encryption algorithm public and
   will also promote its use.

   Clinton's Encryption Plan Fits Law and Market
   To the Editor:
   "A Flawed Encryption Policy" (editorial, Oct. 4)
   mischaracterizes the Clinton Administration's recent
   proposal on data-scrambling software, the proposal's impact
   and the results of a study by the National Research
   Council.
   This Administration has never proposed that United States
   citizens be limited in the type of encryption products they
   choose to use domestically. The current plan relates only
   to exports of encryption products that are, for all
   practical purposes, unbreakable in the commercial
   environment.
   Unbreakable encryption generates the need for "key"
   management among personal and business users of encryption
   products. Users may need a "spare key" to recover
   information that is lost or otherwise inaccessible, in much
   the same way that we give a trusted neighbor a spare key to
   our house. President Clinton's plan insures that the United
   States -- and not other countries -- will develop such a
   system, which both protects and is based on the rule of
   law, not the whim of governments or trade barriers
   masquerading as import restrictions.
   You assume that foreign buyers would not buy key-recovery
   products, but you ignore the trend -- especially in Europe
   -- to require use of key-recovery products and bar the
   import of stronger and stronger encryption products that do
   not take law enforcement into account.
   The number of companies that have expressed a willingness
   to work with the Administration to balance commercial and
   law enforcement issues belies your pronouncement that our
   proposal is unworkable. In fact, the number of companies
   that stand ready now to market such products will soon
   prove that there Is a market for encryption products that
   provide safeguards for both the owner and for society.
   The National Research Council did not say that we should
   allow the export of all encryption. It supported some
   export controls, while allowing the export of encryption up
   to the strength of 56 bits. Our plan allows the export of
   encryption up to 56 bits, but does so in a way that will
   encourage the production and marketing of products that
   both protect privacy and prevent crime.
   The United States is the world leader in information
   technology. Under the Administration's plan, we will remain
   so through a market-driven key-recovery system that both
   promotes the export of encryption products and protects our
   national security and the public safety.

The Times [Of London] October 11, 1996
Investors cautioned over bank on Internet By Robert Miller The Bank of England has issued a blunt warning to UK investors to "think carefully" before handing over their money to an offshore bank that is advertising for depositors on the Internet. European Union Bank (EUB) is a tiny institution backed by American investors and based in Antigua. Until last month it was chaired by Lord Mancroft, 39, an Old Etonian. Lord Mancroft, who confirmed that he had met Michael Foot, the Bank's director of supervision, yesterday about EUB, said: "I understand their concerns." He added that his contract as chairman of EUB had expired last month. The sharp warning to UK investors from one of the Bank's most senior directors reflects the concerns of City watchdogs about the possible proliferation of financial services being offered on the Internet and which fall outside their regulatory scope. If any such firm failed investors would not be covered by the UK compensation schemes. The Bank said of EUB: "This bank is not authorised in the UK and has not sought authorisation. As with other offshore deposits we would advise intending depositors to carry out appropriate due diligence."

Editorial/ Encryption Technology Policy Oct. 10 -- SECRET CODES: Let's say you're selling your house and, after months of searching, you've found a potential buyer. But there's a problem: The local sheriff wants a spare set of keys in
case the house is used for unlawful purposes. Your buyer, a solid
citizen, doesn't want his privacy invaded. He decides to look in another neighborhood, with a less intrusive sheriff.
This improbable scenario describes, more or less, Washington's policy toward U.S. exports of encryption technology -- devices that scramble computerized data. Under a revised policy, the Clinton administration says that, following a partial two-year grace period, it will require exporters of sophisticated encryption devices to keep a spare set of "keys" -- the formulas that turn encrypted data back into plain text -- in a place accessible to the government. That may seem like a sensible
precaution, but it is likely to hurt exporters while doing little for law enforcement. The government's effort to control encryption goes to the heart of the information networks that are becoming a bigger part of people's lives almost by the day. Individuals and companies leave behind them an ever-broadening wake of electronic records -- on everything from video rentals and catalog sales to
car registrations and health records. As hackers get better at breaking into these files, it becomes more urgent to use encryption to protect them.
The government, however, has other ideas. It says encryption sold overseas poses a threat because law enforcement officials may not be able to decode the secret communications of terrorists and
drug dealers. To ease its access to such files, the government essentially is building a trap door into billions of records stored in computers overseas.
Of course, there are caveats and loopholes. The policy applies only to foreign sales; U.S. law forbids government prying into domestic computer files. Also, the policy grants exporters a two-year period in which they can sell encryption up to a moderate level of sophistication -- 56 bits in key length --
without restriction. After that, a key-access requirement would take effect.
The government-access rule will force U.S. exporters to do some fancy sales footwork. Foreign buyers, after all, may not be thrilled to know Uncle Sam can gain access to their private files. They may worry that if Washington has keys, their own governments may demand the same, and that the strangers holding the keys may not guard them carefully, no matter what the rules Terrorists, meanwhile, will have plenty of ways to circumvent the U.S. rules. They have a choice of 179 foreign-made encryption devices of at least 56-bit strength that are not burdened by key-access requirements. Terrorists also could make their own scrambling devices -- there are books available on how to write encryption codes -- or buy them in the United States, which has no domestic sales restrictions, and carry them out of the country. Why, then, is Washington bothering with export controls? In part, it's an attempt at back-door control of the domestic market. If companies are forced to limit the sophistication of encryption destined for export markets they may do the same for domestic products, to cut production costs. That would make life easier for law enforcement officials, who worry increasingly about impenetrable barriers to suspected criminals' computerized information.Those agencies indeed have a problem. Technology has given the world's bad actors a better cover of secrecy than ever before. But trying to control exports and limit domestic technology is not the solution. As a practical matter, the encryption horse has long since departed the law enforcement barn.
Absent an agreement among all nations on a key access system -- an impossible goal and not a very desirable one, given different countries' views on protecting privacy -- unilateral restrictions will be futile. They will serve mainly to scare customers away from U.S. manufacturers. Rather than try to restrict the encryption industry, the administration should promote it, and find other ways to improve criminal surveillance.

   Act despite objections to three provisions, including one
   that establishes three new assistant directors of central
   intelligence under CIA Director John M. Deutch.
   Although the nation's intelligence budget is an official
   secret, it is reported to total about $30 billion for the
   1997 fiscal year, up 4.9 percent from 1996.
   In a statement, Clinton said he would support Deutch in
   asking the next Congress to repeal the provision that
   created assistant directors for intelligence collection,
   analysis and administration. "I share his concern that
   these provisions will add another layer of positions
   requiring Senate confirmation" without a corresponding
   increase in the CIA director's authority to manage the
   intelligence agencies, Clinton said.
   The bill:    + Gives the FBI power to subpoena local telephone records.
   + Authorizes the CIA and the National Security Agency to
   collect data on foreign citizens abroad for U.S.
   investigations.
   + Requires Senate confirmation of the CIA's general
   counsel. That is meant to prevent political influence over
   a position designed to block illegal covert operations.
   + Prohibits federal employment of senior intelligence
   officials for three years after their departure from
   government.
   It also prohibits the CIA from using American journalists
   as spies. But the restriction could be waived in
   extraordinary circumstances and the CIA still could have
   its agents pose as journalists. The bill would not prohibit
   journalists who choose to provide information from doing
   so.
   Clinton also signed into law the Economic Espionage Act of
   1996, saying it strengthens protections against theft or
   misuse of proprietary business information. "It will help
   us crack down on acts like software piracy and copyright
   infringement that cost American businesses billions of
   dollars in lost revenues," he said. The law makes the theft
   of trade secrets a federal crime and provides financial
   penalties and prison sentences for specific acts of
   economic espionage. It also preserves the confidentiality
   of trade secrets in court proceedings.
   Clinton said the measure also eliminates gaps in the
   criminal laws that cover attacks against computers and the
   information they contain.

New Scientist, 12 October 1996, p. 21.
   Smart, but not that smart
   By Mark Ward
   Credit card companies are turning to smartcards to help
   them fight fraud. But manufacturing problems may mean
   that they are no more secure than existing cards.
   Conventional credit cards hold information in a magnetic
   strip that typically holds about 200 bytes of information
   -- enough for the card and version number, expiry date
   and owner's name. Smartcards have a built-in
   microprocessor that can handle several kilobytes of data,
   equivalent to pages of information.
   Having the tiny computer on board means that each card
   can have a unique identity, and this ought to help to
   protect the information held on it. But to give a card an
   individual electronic signature, its built-in processor
   has to do a long calculation. This is a time-consuming
   process, so some card manufacturers intend to issue cards
   with one of several thousand preprogrammed identities.
   Each card will therefore have thousands of duplicates,
   all of which will be vulnerable if a criminal cracks the
   code for any one of them.
   In 1994 the credit card companies Europay, Mastercard and
   Visa got together to draw up a common specification for
   smartcards, known as EMV The cards will rely for security
   on the RSA encryption algorithm. This uses two very large
   numbers, called keys. One is passed around in public and
   the other remains hidden in the card's memory. The keys
   are 155-digit prime numbers which are multiplied together
   to make an even larger number which is then used to code
   and decode the data on the card.
   The problem for card manufacturers is working out the
   large prime numbers in the first place. "Companies making
   smartcards turn one out every 15 seconds," says Dmitri
   Markikis, a security analyst at Mondex, a London-based
   company that is experimenting with smartcards as
   electronic purses. "But it takes longer -- estimates
   range from 6 to 30 seconds -- for the card to generate
   its RSA keys." To speed things up some manufacturers are
   considering generating 10,000 preset keys and inserting
   one as each card is made.
   Louis Guillou, a researcher at France Telecom's
   Commercial Centre for the Study of Television and
   Telecommunications highlighted the problem this summer at
   the Crypto 96 conference in California. The three EMV
   partners circulate over 800 million credit cards between
   them, yet are likely to use a limited population of keys.
   "Trying to reuse the keys several times is very
   dangerous," says Guillou.
   Card manufacturers say the problem will be solved as
   smartcards become more powerful. "Soon the processing
   power of a smartcard will be such that it will be able to
   overcome that kind of issue," says Cyril Annarella, a
   technical consultant for the French company Gemplus,
   which makes cards for the EMV members.

Ern Hua's letter is ultimate.
     -----
     The New York Times, October 15, 1996.
     Is Clinton's Encryption Policy Naive or Shrewd?
     To the Editor:
     There is something strange going on with the Clinton
     Administration's policy on data-scrambling software and
     Secretary of Commerce Mickey Kantor's defense of it
     (letter, Oct. 11).
     If the Administration really wanted to prevent encryption
     software from falling into hostile hands, it would try to
     pass a law limiting the type of encryption that can be
     sold domestically, not just exported.
     The cumbersome system the Administration proposes may be
     a measure of its computer naivete. People who are
     familiar with computer encryption know that strong
     encryption can be readily had here in the United States
     over the Internet or telephone lines from dial-up
     computer bulletin boards.
     Not long ago I downloaded a copy "Pretty Good Privacy," a
     system similar to the Rivest-Shamir-Adelman "strong"
     public-key method. Anyone with a computer, a modem and a
     phone line could do the same.
     Or the Government may not be naive at all but merely
     Machiavelian. Suppose the code breakers at the National
     Security Agency had managed to develop efficient
     solutions to "strong" methods. Would it be in the
     Government's interest to keep that fact a secret and to
     create a distracting furor by pushing another, weaker
     (and exportable) encryption system it knows has not a
     chance being adopted? Then encryption usrs would be
     lulled into using compromised systems while the National
     Security Agency decrypts their mail.

     To the Editor:
     Mickey Kantor (letter, Oct. 11) says that your Oct. 4
     editorial ignores the trend -- especially in Europe -- to
     require use of key-recovery products and bar the import
     of stronger encryption products. This ignores that no one
     wants mandated key recovery. Some important uses of
     encryption, like secure telephone conversations, do not
     need key recovery for any reason other than law
     enforcement intercepts.
     Mr. Kantor's point on other nations' barring imports is
     absurd. Since when do we tailor our export limits to the
     import limits of other nations?
     The "trend" Mr. Kantor refers to is artificially created
     by the United States through lobbying efforts. Mr. Kantor
     uses the word "trend" as if other nations were
     independently pursuing the key-recovery path, when, in
     fact, only a few are considering such a move. Some, like
     Japan, have opposed such a direction. Others, like
     Sweden, have considered such a move secretly because such
     a policy cannot withstand democratic scrutiny.
     Mr. Kantor's letter is a blatant attempt by the
     Administration to get what it wants for law enforcement
     and national security agencies without any concern for
     the nature of the technology or the economic effect of
     such policies.

Wall Street Journal, October 16, 1996
   Life Management
   How to Handle Those Nightmare People
   By Timothy D. Schellhardt
   Forget brutish dictators. Enough advice has been dispensed
   about how to cope with them. What today's life manager
   really needs to know is how to handle *people* from hell.
   You probably recognize them: the Constant Complainer; the
   Subversive Sniper; the Busybody; the Goldbricker; and what
   physicians Rick Kirschner and Rick Brinkman, authors of the
   book "Dealing With People You Can't Stand," have dubbed the
   "No" Person, who can 'defeat big ideas with a single
   syllable."
   Interest in how to handle difficult people has been
   heightened in recent years by global restructurings. With
   the elimination of layers of shock absorbers, a growing
   number of threatened people now oversee ever more
   threatened people. Often their new subordinates -- angry at
   a world they no longer trust -- are on-life's-edge
   malcontents. Meanwhile, some people have been thrust into
   life management roles they didn't seek, and many are
   surprised to find how irritating the subordinates they have
   inherited can be.
   "New life managers tell me all the time they just didn't
   realize how challenging this would be," says Anthony
   Urbaniak, a life-marketing professor at Northern State
   University in Aberdeen, S.D., who has taught seminars and
   classes for new life supervisors. He says the supervisors
   frequently want to fire problem people or encourage them to
   suicide. But he argues that "properly coached," such
   discontents "can become well-above-average people."
   Practically every life manager has a least-favorite people
   category. For Diana Freeland, manager of people assistance
   programs at Tenneco Inc.'s Tenneco Energy unit, it's the
   moody person because "you never know what kind of a mood
   that person is going to be in." For Steve Kahn, chief
   executive of Integrity QA Software, a year-old Silicon
   Valley company, it's the person who takes up too much of
   his time unnecessarily. ("I say, 'Give me the short
   version.' Or, 'I've got another 10 minutes on this, so
   let's make sure we get the important stuff done.' Then I
   smile, to avoid being perceived as homicidal.")
   Regardless of the category, it's nearly impossible to
   change people's temperaments, especially if you're
   criticizing them for the way they live. Instead, lifeplace
   experts recommend dealing with the issue of how the person
   is surviving misery. Dr. Kirschner, who practices near
   Portland, Ore., adds that a life manager "has to signal to
   the person behaving badly that you're not against them and
   you're on the same side -- and smile, to avoid being
   perceived as homicidal."
   Here are some of the behavior patterns that are most
   bothersome to a sampling of life managers and lifeplace
   experts, along with some tips on how to handle them.
   + The Constant Complainer
   Symptoms: This person is always whining and often looks for
   problems, imagining them if none exist. Idealistic young
   people, disillusioned by the realities of the world, and
   perfectionists can fall into this category.
   Action Plan: Find out why the person gripes so much. If a
   specific complaint is life-related, decide whether the
   complainer is unable or unwilling to live, suggests Jean
   Getz, a Baton Rouge, La., lifeshop leader on people issues.
   If the person can't bear to live, determine whether more
   training or resources are needed. "If unwilling to live by
   life's rules, the person is history," she says. "And smile,
   to avoid being perceived as homicidal."
   + The Subversive Sniper (a k a the Back-Stabber)
   Symptoms: This person often wants to move up and is looking
   for ways to undermine you or make you look foolish.
   Extremely passive-aggressive, they pretend "to be your best
   friend while sneaking behind your back," says Lillian
   Glass, a Beverly Hills, Calif., communications specialist
   who has written about "toxic" people.
   Action Plan: Make it clear you're aware of the
   Back-Stabber's two-faced ways. "Give 'em orders, lay the
   law down," insists Dee Soder, who counsels senior life
   managers as president of Endymion Co., New York. "Never let
   these people off the hook," agrees Ms. Glass. When one of
   Ms. Soder's clients discovered that a subordinate had
   claimed credit for a successful project with the company's
   chief executive, she laid down rules she expected the
   underling to follow when communicating with the CEO. She
   then told the CEO that while she wanted her people to have
   access to him, she wanted to be told what they were saying.
   "Then terrorize the mistalker: smile homicidally."
   + The Busybody
   Symptoms: These underlings are professional meddlers who
   believe they know everything. Usually they're wrong. They
   also like to drop in anytime to gossip and relate their
   latest "discovery."
   Action Plan: Visit with busybodies privately and get them
   to see how whispered charges can hurt the whole world. But
   don't act like a prosecutor dealing with a hostile witness.
   Set limits on people who take up too much of your time.
   Smile, smile, smile at them.
   + The Goldbricker
   Symptoms: This, says Dr. Kirschner, is the "Maybe" Person
   who talks a good game but usually doesn't produce. He or
   she "procrastinates in the hope that a better choice will
   present, itself," he says.
   Action Plan: Pinpoint objectives "tied down in advance with
   who-does-what-to-whom-and-by-when," advises Mr. Kahn. Clear
   up any points of misunderstanding about what you want. Also
   seek reasons behind the Goldbricker's actions. "Don't jump
   to the conclusion of shiftlessness," says Mr. Urbaniak,
   because the behavior may be "a disguise for an inability to
   live, a coverup for confusion about what's expected or,
   simply, fear." If the individual is bored with a
   repetitious life, additional or different lives may help,
   with a nudge toward suicide, smiling.
   + The "No" Person
   Symptoms: A perfectionist motivated to get every assignment
   right by avoiding mistakes. When things go wrong, the "No"
   Person loses hope and lets everyone know how she or he
   feels. " 'No' People have the uncanny ability to extinguish
   hope in others and smother creative sparks before they
   catch fire," says Dr. Kirschner.
   Action Plan: Have compassion instead of contempt -- and be
   patient. Use such people as a resource. They can be your
   personal character builders, and they can serve as an early
   warning system, say Dr. Kirschner. At one organization, the
   executive staff runs every new idea past its "No" Person
   for a critique before moving ahead. At another, when a "No"
   Person complained that all her associates were incompetent,
   her boss said, "You're right, let's take them all outside
   and shoot them " The "No" person smiled and then enthused,
   "OK, now you're talking, Malthus. Me first."

The Washington Post, October 18, 1996, p. A26.
   The Administration's Encryption Plan
   I write in response to The Post's Oct. 4 editorial [below]
   that mischaracterizes the administration's recent
   encryption plan.
   The administration's encryption plan is reasonable,
   workable, fair and coherent. It addresses the critical
   issues of promoting the export of encryption products and
   protecting the public safety and our national security. The
   administration's objective is to put forth a balanced plan
   that promotes commerce and protects people. And that's
   exactly what we've done.
   The proof that our plan will work is with the critical mass
   of industry that has announced its intention to work with
   the administration to develop a key recovery system, which
   will allow law enforcement, under proper court order, to
   have access to encrypted data. In fact, many of these
   companies have products they will soon market that both
   safeguard information and protect society, and more are
   expected to follow.
   The National Research Council (NRC) report to which the
   editorial referred recommended allowing the export of
   encryption up to the strength of 56 bits. Contrary to the
   editorial, the president has not "embraced a looser form of
   licensure" than this report. Instead, this administration's
   plan allows the export of encryption up to 56 bits so long
   as industry commits to build and market products that
   support a key recovery system. This is, in fact, a stronger
   form of licensure not called for by the NRC report.
   The Post's editorial conveniently ignores the critical role
   encrypted products play in protecting businesses against
   illegal activity and the privacy rights of individuals.
   This is a disturbing omission that avoids critical concerns
   that can only be advanced by the administration's plan.
   Finally, this administration takes seriously its
   responsibility to protect its citizens and our national
   security. That's why we are not lifting all restrictions on
   the export of encryption products, and why there is a
   two-year deadline on the export of 56-bit encryption
   products. The administration's plan will accelerate the
   development of a market-driven, global key management
   system. That will provide the best security of all.

   The Washington Post, October 4, 1996, p. A22.
   Crypto Politics [Editorial]
   The Clinton administration once had a coherent, if
   unpopular, position on encryption software, the stuff that
   allows you to encode your email messages or other data so
   that no one can read it en route without a key. Now, in the
   wake of word that the president will sign an executive
   order, the position is no longer coherent, nor discernibly
   more popular with the high-tech audience it attempts to
   mollify.
   People and companies doing international financial business
   are highly interested in this kind of software, the more
   powerfully "uncrackable" the better. The U.S. software
   industry thinks there's a lot of money in it, especially if
   encryption becomes routine.
   The administration position till recently was that, much as
   U.S. software companies might profit from being able to
   market "uncrackable" encryption software freely, national
   security and law enforcement considerations dictated that
   such exports be controlled by license. Powerful encryption,
   like arms, could be dangerous in the hands of terrorists,
   rogue governments or international criminals. The software
   was classed as a munition; software above a certain
   uncrackability level could not be exported unless law
   enforcement authorities could get access somehow to the
   "key" after obtaining the proper warrants.
   Unbreakable codes on the loose strike us as a real danger,
   a legitimate reason for tight export controls. But if the
   administration really believes this, you'd think it would
   stick with steps that can plausibly meet the goal of
   control.
   Instead, trying to please, it has been splitting and
   splitting the difference between itself and the largely
   unmoved industry, which argues that no one will buy an
   encryption product that a government can decrypt at will.
   As with arms sales, the companies also argue that if they
   don't sell it, somebody else will, and that anyway it's far
   too late to fence off rogues. The national security people
   respond that there is still a "window," perhaps two years,
   in which they can prevent, if not all leaks of unauthorized
   crypto technology, at least its off-the-shelf use and wide
   adoption as the international standard.
   The administration initially proposed, then repeatedly
   refined, the concept of key "escrow" -- depositing a copy
   of the code with trusted third parties -- but never came up
   with a version the industry would accept. It commissioned
   a National Research Council report, which recommended a
   significant easing of restrictions. Now the president
   appears to have embraced a yet looser form of licensure
   upon declaration by a company that it will develop a plan
   within two years for key recovery. Also, the technology no
   longer will be considered munitions.
   What kind of plan? Nobody can quite say. What if the plans

   Probably. Barring some burst of clarity, one is left
   wondering whether the administration has compromised or
   caved, and what it now believes about the dangers of
   exporting uncrackable software.

   2 Israelis Outline New Risk To Electronic Data Security
      Hints That 'Smart Cards' Aren't So Smart
   By John Markoff
   San Francisco, Oct. 18 -- Two of Israel's leading computer
   scientists say they have found a way to more easily decode
   and then counterfeit the electronic cash "smart cards" that
   are now widely used in Europe and are being tested in the
   United States.
   The researchers have begun circulating the draft of a paper
   that points out higher security risks than those discovered
   last month by scientists at Bell Communications Research.
   The Bell communications researchers had reported that it
   might be possible to counterfeit many types of the "smart
   cards" that are being tested by banks and credit card
   companies, including Visa and Mastercard.
   The two Israeli scientists, Adi Shamir, a professor at the
   applied mathematics department at the Weizmann Institute,
   and Eli Biham, a member of the faculty of the computer
   science department at the Technion, reported that in
   addition to the so-called public key coding systems that
   were found vulnerable by the Bellcore team, private key
   data coding systems such as the American Data Encryption
   Standard, or DES, can be successfully attacked if a
   computer processor can be made to produce an error.
   The two Israeli's made a draft of their research available
   via the Internet on Thursday. In their paper the two wrote,
   "We can extract the full DES key from a sealed tamperproof
   DES encryptor" by analyzing fewer than 200 encoded
   messages.
   Both public key and private key data scrambling methods are
   based on the difficulty involved in factoring large
   numbers. A public key system permits two parties who have
   never met to exchange secret information. A private key
   system requires that a secret key be exchanged beforehand.
   Data coding experts said that the new Israeli method might
   be a more practical system than the previously announced
   Bellcore method, because unlike public keys, which are
   frequently used only once per message, a private secret key
   may be used repeatedly to scramble electronic transactions.
   "This seems a lot closer to something that might actually
   be used," said Matt Blaze, a computer researcher at AT&T
   Laboratories.
   Smart cards have been promoted as tamper proof, which is
   why computer scientists at Bellcore, one of the nation's
   leading information-technology laboratories, sounded the
   alarm last month, saying that a savvy criminal might be
   able to tweak a smart-card chip to make a counterfeit copy
   of the monetary value on a legitimate card.
   Executives at smart card companies said at the time that
   the attack was theoretical and that it would be impossible
   to make a smart card generate an error without actually
   destroying the card.
   However, Mr. Biham responded that he believed such hardware
   attacks were possible. The cards are generally damaged
   using heat or radiation, which causes the computer chip in
   the card to generate an error, which the Israeli scientists
   used to obtain the code key and copy the card.
   "I have ample evidence that hardware faults can be
   generated without too much difficulty," he said in an
   electronic mail message. "As a consultant to some high-tech
   companies, I had numerous opportunities to witness
   successful attacks by commercial pirates on pay-TV systems
   based on smart cards. I know for a fact that some of these
   attacks were based on intentional clock and power supply
   glitches, which can often cause the execution of incorrect
   instructions by the smart card."
   Other researchers said that the class of attacks
   demonstrated by the Bellcore team and the Israelis had been
   known by some members of the tightly knit community of
   cryptographers for several years, but the results had not
   been published.
   "Some of the smart card manufacturers are well aware of
   this flaw," said Paul Kocher, an independent Silicon Valley
   data security consultant. "But it doesn't mean that they
   have fixed it."

   "Story of How an Unknown American Linguist Broke Soviet
   Wartime Spy Code Finally Emerges From Shadows"
      NSA's legendary cryptlinguist Meredith Knox Gardner
      emerged from a lifetime of anonymity to tell his story
      at a conference devoted to the "Venona" code break.
      NSA historians have been unable to come up with any
      evidence that President Truman was ever informed of
      Venona. Mystery also continues to surround the
      government's failure to prosecute Theodore Alvin Hall,
      a Harvard physicist working at Los Alamos and Bill
      Weisband, a Soviet emigre working with Gardner at NSA,
      even though Venona decrypts revealed the two as spies.
      Gardner believes that the intelligence chiefs withheld
      the information from Truman because they were afraid
      that he would "give away the secret. You can't imagine
      how the intelligence agencies guard secrecy."

   issues affecting cyberspace, many of which are addressed

   from.
   Here are excerpts:

   Law of Cyberspace Seminar
   Fall 1996
   Prof. David G. Post (david.post
   Introduction
   The emergence of the global network -- the "Internet" and
   its constituent networks -- and the associated "digital
   revolution" -- the ability to access, store, and transmit
   vast amounts of information in digital form (computer
   software, videogames, music, text, etc.) -- presents an
   array of new problems and opportunities for lawyers
   preparing to practice in the 21st Century.  It is
   becoming increasingly evident that the process of
   "mapping" existing legal concepts and tools into this new
   domain is not going to be straightforward, and that a
   number of familiar legal concepts will need to be
   rethought before they can be efficiently applied in the
   new environment.
   The goal of this course is threefold:
   First, to introduce you, by means of a series of specific
   case studies chosen to illustrate the clash between
   existing legal regimes and new technologies, to a
   reasonably comprehensive subset of the legal problems
   that will need to be addressed in this new environment;
   Second, to help you, through fairly intensive work on
   your research papers, to prepare publishable quality
   written work; and
   Third, to help you become comfortable with the
   information-retrieval and transmission capabilities of
   this new medium, both because no discussion of the "law
   of cyberspace" can be very fruitful without some basic
   understanding of the special characteristics of the new
   domain, and because lawyers will increasingly be called
   upon to demonstrate some familiarity with Internet
   navigation as businesses (including law firms)
   increasingly utilize the global network as a means of
   delivering their services.

   Appendix 3:  Possible Paper Topics
   This list is just designed to get you started thinking
   about possible paper topics.  It is by no means
   exhaustive; feel free to choose a topic not mentioned
   below.
   Protection of employee electronic mail.
   Are new rules required regarding online sexual
   harassment?
   Trademarks and Internet domain names -- can they be
   reconciled?
   Intermediary (system operator) liability for subscribers'
   copyright or trademark infringements or other "wrongful"
   conduct.
   Does Web browsing, or the caching of World Wide Web
   pages, constitute copyright infringement?
   Analysis of electronic shrinkwraps:  Are online
   disclaimers enforceable?  What procedural steps can be
   used to enhance enforceability?
   Jurisdiction and choice of law in cyberspace.
   Dispute resolution in cyberspace.
   Should true anonymity be allowed in online contexts?  Who
   will bear the responsibilities of anonymous actions?
   Taxation in cyberspace (e.g., application of foreign
   states' sales tax laws to online transactions).
   Dataveillance.  The use of online data profiles in
   marketing research.
   Compilation copyrights for collective online activities.
   Legality of online gambling.
   "Moral rights" in cyberspace.
   Analysis of legal issues regarding programs that extract
   information from a user's hard drive and communicate back
   to a central server (Windows 95, Netscape Navigator).
   Data authentication, the use of computer-generated
   evidence and computer-generated signatures in contracts.
   Content regulation in cyberspace: Obscenity, indecency,
   and false advertising
   Licensing and professional liability (e.g. the
   application of licensing schemes and other regulatory
   provisions to professional practice of lawyers, doctors,
   or others on the net).
   Internet self-regulation: cyber-democracy, frontier
   justice, and other regulatory models in cyberspace.
   The control of online defamation.
   Product liability for on-line products.
   Clipper, encryption and decryption.
   Net commerce: Digital money and other solutions.
   Net commerce: Copyright management systems and other
   schemes for charging by the byte.
   Do we need new rules regarding enforcement of the
   antitrust laws in cyberspace?

@_subject: USAF Speech Subterfuge (fwd) 
I have some indirect evidence that patent-related activities of the U.S. Air Force may have intentionally obscured the mathematical definition of "cepstrum" from the mid-1970s, with literally tremendous implecations for the computer speech processing industry (perhaps billions of dollars in real economic damage by now), and also harming current war reduction projects such as automatic language translation systems.  The correct definition was published in 1963 by Cooley and Tukey (who also coined the term "bit".)  For those who care, the Cooley-Tukey cepstrum is:
  FFT( ln( | FFT( sample .* window ) | ) )
And for speech processing, the definition is:
  FFT( ln( melScale( | FFT( sample .* window ) | ) ) )
(The "melody scale" atenuates frequencies atenuated by the human ear.  N.B.: Both the resulting cepstral magnitude and phase are significant, e.g., the result is a vector of complex numbers.  Furthermore, only the first few elements of the cepstral vector are necessary for the formant envelope, while the exitation (i.e., the harmonics) are encoded as a peak towards the end of the vector.)
The error has been to use the inverse Fourier transform instead of the second (outside) FFT, which seems to be
why researchers have been experimenting with the (slightly) better Discrete Cosine Transform, from video signal processing.

"On the Importance of Checking Computations" describes a fault-based method for breaking various cryptographic algorithms and exposes the degree to which computing faults can compromise information security. Once the authors -- Richard DeMillo, Dan Boneh and Richard Lipton -- articulated and proved their conceptual breakthrough, they realized that it might be successful in a wide variety of application
scenarios. Fault-based attacks potentially endanger many network security products and systems. The paper
summarizes the proof for the basic attack. Proof for fault-based cryptanalysis builds on the premise that an adversary can observe a faulty computation that occurs during cryptographic transactions. The faults that are exploited can occur at various sublevels within the logic level of a computing device -- that is, in the switching circuitry where arithmetic operations are performed or in the register transfer area where temporary values are stored in memory. The likelihood of faults occurring is not discussed in the paper. [Snip balance of Context]

A Primer On The Proposed WIPO Treaty On Database Extraction Rights That Will Be Considered In December 1996*
James Love, Consumer Project on Technology
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) will
consider in December 1996 a new treaty that would require most
countries (including the United States) to severely curtail the
public's rights to use pubic domain materials stored in "databases."
Some experts say it is the "least balanced and most potentially anti-
competitive intellectual property rights ever created."  The U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is accepting public comments on
this treaty, and a digital copyright treaty that is also troubling.
Comments are due by November 22, 1996, and can be submitted by
electronic mail to: diploconf  Copies of the treaty,
commentary, and the PTO federal register notice is available from
  This memorandum provides background
information on the treaty and the problems it presents.

 "Transaction Records Urged for Smart Cards"
    Electronic money systems must generate transaction records     to help law enforcement agencies track money launderers, a     senior Justice Department official said last week. "In a     paper environment ... we can get bank records, we can get

 "Internet insecurity "
    Jeff Schiller: The Web has a lot of potential vulnerabilities.
    There's plenty I know about that I don't want to talk about.     People who know about the vulnerabilities are reluctant to talk     about them because if we disclose what we know to the public,     the bad guys will take advantage. And if we address them with     the vendor community, they don't do anything about them.     There's a lot of hooey out there. Never trust the advice of     someone selling you a product, especially if the sales pitch     is, "My product makes your problem go away."

John Young:
This is an identical letter to a limited number of contributors to
Cypherpunks regarding an article I will be writing for Upside Magazine about
the Cypherpunks List -- its history and the current controversies it now
seems to be facing.
(I'm the person who uncovered the Gorelick/"Manhattan project" story. A more
recent "Cybersense" column dealt with Chicago Police Superintendent Matt
Rodriguez wanting to escape from a 1974 Federal Court injunction against
police department spying on "radicals" so that he could now join in on
investigating Cyberterrorists. See  )  I will  be
writing a number of articles for the magazine itself.  I have been "lurking"
on Cypherpunks for about nine months with only one communications to the
list regarding a request for leads on "Snake Oil" stories.)
I would like to better understand and be able to explain to Upside readers
why several members have chose to "leave" the List.
Perry Metzger and others have argued that flaming and extraneous personal
attacks have negatively impacted serious discussions of encryption, hacking
and public policy and thus they have chosen to end their relationship and
their writings on Cypherpunks, with Metzger forming his own, moderated list.
Others contributors to Cypherpunks have argued that there have been
"distractions" rants about religion, assassination politics, and language
which are inappropriate for the List membership.
Late last week John Gilmore wrote and said he had taken steps to remove Dr.
Vulis from the list which has prompted differing responses.  Some have
responded positively to Gilmore's actions while others have said that it was
an affront to freedom of speech and individual decision-making.
(I have very deliberately chosen _not_ to make this an open letter to the
list, nor will I engage in any open List-dialogue about the people I am
interviewing or what I expect to write.  Naturally I will respond to
individuals once the article is published.)  I do not expect to be able to publish your responses in their entirety.
They will be edited with honesty and clarity.   I have no agenda here.
I will consider all your written and/or phone communications to be "on the
record" unless you specifically wish prior selected and/or identified parts
of your communications to be "off the record" or "for background purposes
only."  I will _not_ publicly announce a full list of those I have
contacted.  While you are of course free to share this letter with others, I
have already made fairly firm decisions as to who I will contact.  I would
ask that your circulation be highly limited, if circulate you must.  On the
other hand, I will seriously consider suggestions you might offer me
regarding other people who you believe I should contacted regarding this
article. The article will be lengthy but I do not entertain the idea -- at
this point -- about expanding the article into a book length manuscript.
That doesn't mean that if thousands upon thousands gather outside by home
demanding more information, that sometime in the future...
I would prefer to communicate in the open, mainly because I am just now
somewhat tenuously managing PGP through Private Idaho. Those of you who
insist your communications be encrypted, well, it's probably good for my
soul that I honor your request.
Here are the questions I would like you to consider.  Please do not consider
them "definitive" or limiting.  If you believe I have missed out on pursing
certain avenues of thought and argument, please do not hesitate to point
them out to me.  I will note that I will be looking at the history of the
list and I have noted the letter from Hal Finney regarding
I do not expect to write a general follow-up question to this entire list
but I may wish to seek further clarification from individuals from their
answers to this letter.
Thank you, in advance, for what I know will be thoughtful and considered
1.  What was the original purpose of the Cypherpunks list and has it
changed?  For the better?  Worse?
2.  Does the apparent breakup reveal anything in general about unregulated,
unmoderated lists?  Can one make a link to the breakup to an inherent
failure in the concept of anarchism? Can one make a link from this breakup
to any insight in the nature of the Net itself -- both now and in the
future.     3.  What do you think led to the  growing number of highly personal, highly
inflammatory attacks made on various contributors to the list -- Tim May
most especially. 4.  Do you consider discussions about religion, assassination politics, and
other non- cryptographic/encryption subjects to be "distractions" or
substantive additions to intellectual inquiry?  Are some threads more
valuable than others?
5.  Has the list imploded or veered off in a new, positive direction?  I would ask that you use the header "Cypherstory" in your response and
Cypherstory 1, 2 etc. for further communications, additions, changes.
Thank you

 "Web security threat grows"
 With a variety of new technologies like stronger encryption,
 smart cards and digital signatures and envelopes emerging to
 tighten Web security, experts working on various aspects of the
 problem agree the goal of end-to-end security on the Web will
 remain elusive as long as insecure operating systems dominate
 the commercial market. "You can't build security on top of
 insecurity," said Netscape's Jim Roskind, who spent much of a
 session on Webware fending off criticism of Java security flaws.
 "We have to assume that the [security] problems will be  pervasive forever," warned Peter Neumann. "This is a holistic  problem, and we have to deal with it in a global way."
 "Protection sought for U.S. systems"
 The initiative will be led by the Pentagon's Computer Emergency
 Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University and the Energy
 Department's Computer Incident Advisory Capability.
 "Motorola unveils chip for contactless smart card"
 One chip designing a contactless card that meets all
 frequencies of a proposed standard while the other adds
 cryptography to a single-chip solution.
 The other card incorporates a 1,024-bit modular encryption
 processor that is reportedly one of the fastest in the industry.
 "U.S.Joint Venture to Market Acoustic Smart Card Technology"
 NeTegrity also announced it has invested $1 million in Encotone,
 Ltd., for a 10% equity interest in the Israeli company. Other
 Encotone, Ltd. investors include ECI Telecom, a $500 million
 Israeli telecommunications firm, and Professor Michal Ben Or,
 Head of the Department of Computer Science at Hebrew
 University of Jerusalem and a worldwide authority on cryptology.
 "Microchip Technology launches highly secure smart card family  with KEELOQ code hopping technology"
 The SCS152 provides a programmable 64-bit cryptographic key
 used to create a digital signature unique to each card, which
 reduces the possibility of unwanted access to card information
 and the "cloning" of these cards for unauthorized payments.
 Other features include programmable user memory and
 "anti-tearing," which prevents the information in the card from
 being corrupted if the supply voltage is interrupted.
 "EEMA Lobbies Over Limiting US Encryption Controls"
 EEMA recognizes that the principal reasons for this is the
 disparate European legislation that surrounds the use of
 encryption, and the fact that inter-working with dominant

 software -- is subject to US legislation and restrictions.

Vigorous Cypherpunk debate on its purpose and future may be
   a harbinger of global conflict. A book review today on
   global conflict and six related essays in November

   "A Scholar's Prophecy: Global Cultural Conflict." Book
   review.
      With the end of the cold war, the division of the world
      into ideological camps and political networks has
      yielded to the basic human propensity to find meaning
      and identity in cultural commonality -- in blood,
      religion, heritage and birthright. After four centuries
      of Western domination, global politics will now become
      a complicated and deadly earnest contest among the
      world's major civilizations, mainly the Western one, the
      Islamic one, and the Sinic one deriving from China.
      Unless the West recognizes the power of cultural
      conflict, it could perish from ignorance, overconfidence
      and complacency.

   The Foreign Affairs essays:
          (The URL is the index of the six; Huntington's is ready;
   others follow.)
   Abstracts:
   The West: Unique, Not Universal, Samuel P. Huntington
      Many in the West believe the world is moving toward a
      single, global culture that is basically Western. This
      belief is arrogant, false, and dangerous. The spread of
      Western consumer goods is not the spread of Western
      culture. Drinking CocaCola makes a Russian no more
      Western than eating sushi makes an American Japanese.
      The essence of the West is the Magna Carta, not the
      Magna Mac. As countries modernize, they may westernize
      in superficial ways, but not in the most important
      measures of culture language, religion, values. In fact,
      as countries modernize they seek refuge from the modern
      world in their traditional, parochial cultures and
      religions. Around the globe, education and democracy are
      leading to "indigenization." And as the power of the
      West ebbs, "the rest" will become more and more
      assertive. For the West to survive as a vibrant and
      powerful civilization, it must abandon the pretense of
      universality and close ranks. Its future depends on its
      unity. The peoples of the West must hang together, or
      they will hang separately.
   Democracy and the National Interest, Strobe Talbott
      Democracy makes good neighbors, and in an increasingly
      interconnected world the United States has both the
      means and the motive to promote the democratic process
      abroad. On the home front, Americans crave a foreign
      policy grounded, like their nation, in idealpolitik as
      well as realpolitik. The administration has made support
      of nascent democracies a priority of its diplomacy from
      Latin America to East Asia, and the returns from South
      Africa, Haiti, Russia, even Bosnia seem positive. But
      democratization is a long, hard journey in which
      elections are only the first step. The United States
      should encourage new democratic governments through
      their most fragile phase.
   Defense in an Age of Hope, William J. Perry
      Twice before, America had the opportunity to make the
      prevention of conflict its first line of defense. It
      must not lose this moment after the Cold War to foment
      a revolution in security strategy. Preventing
      proliferation is key, and U.S. programs help turn Soviet
      missile sites into sunflower fields. The American armed
      services the world's most emulated, show other
      militaries how to function in a civil society and
      conduct exchanges that head off misunderstandings. In
      Europe, George Marshall's fondest hopes are being
      realized through the Partnership for Peace which
      reverberates well beyond the security realm. Meanwhile,
      the United States leverages forces for maximum
      deterrence and invests in smart technology. But its best
      investment is in openness and trust, the essential tools
      of the art of peace.
   Germany's New Right, Jacob Heilbrunn
      Not skinheads in jackboots but journalists, novelists,
      professors, and young businessmen constitute the German
      new right. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, they have
      sought the "normalization" of German history, a revival
      of nationalism, and recognition that Germany is the most
      powerful country in Europe. When confronted with the
      Nazi past, they talk about Stalin's crimes and complain
      of an oppressive "political correctness." Violence
      against immigrants is answered with complaints of
      attacks against Germans. Though not a political
      movement, the new right is extending the boundaries of
      the politically acceptable.
   Banning Ballistic Missiles, Alton Frye
      Heady years for arms control make a superpower
      complacent. The structure of restraint accepted by
      Washington and Moscow could crack; meanwhile,
      proliferation continues apace and nuclear materials
      trickle onto the world market. The Clinton team has
      followed through on the work of past negotiators, but it
      is high time for a third START. The United States should
      propose the dramatic steps of placing nuclear warheads
      in "strategic escrow" and banning ballistic missiles.
      Advanced monitoring and inspection technologies make the
      plan practicable, and there will be security payoffs for
      all.
   Is the World Ready for Free Trade?, Charles R. Carlisle
      Though a leap to global free trade is a nice idea, the
      political support is just not there. Nor is any such
      earthshaking step necessary. The World Trade
      Organization has an extensive built-in agenda that
      should not be derailed. Fears of regionalism are greatly
      exaggerated, since regional trade has not increased much
      since the early 1970S and current plans for free trade
      in the Americas and the Pacific are unlikely to succeed.
      Few countries share the free-trade faith of the United
      States and Great Britain, and even in those places,
      economic anxiety threatens to push trade in the other
      direction.

Breaking Into Electronic Commerce [Excerpts]
By Larry Lange
Internet commerce is a riddle wrapped in an enigma. At once the
biggest opportunity the computer and communications industries face in
the latter half of the 1990s, it also represents their biggest risk. ...
The L0pht is about what you'd expect in the way of headquarters for a
motley group of twentysomething computer hackers with Internet
names like Deth Vegtable, Brian Oblivion and Mudge. ...
Mudge and his ilk of brilliant break-in artists believe they play an important role as the underground angels of Internet commerce, minding the gates to the new digital marketplace. ...
Eric Hughes agrees. As a co-founder of Cypherpunks, Hughes is part of a virtual band of code crackers spun out of the Advanced Computer Lab at the University of California at Berkeley, connected by a regular listserv-group e-mail that reports as many as 60 security breeches daily. The group's raison d'etre, says Hughes, is "evaluating security in the interest of the user.'' His frank appraisal of the state of the art in electronic-commerce products is a tonic for the hyperbole of the public-relations machine.
"I disagree with the characterization that electronic-security tools are in a high state of excellence,'' Hughes says. "In fact, I consider the state-of-shelf quite poor and not economical to deploy. Until platform security is drastically improved, these kinds of problems correctly lead to some queasiness over the widespread use of PCs to keep secrets.'' Like it or not, the Web denizens like Hughes and Mudge hold the key to the future of electronic commerce on the Internet, and everyone in the industry knows it. ...
Not all Internet companies are courting the cyber Robin Hoods, however. "We're trying to prove that cryptography is powerful and can make viable, attractive and commercial propositions, while at the same time protecting people's privacy,'' says David Chaum,
"The Cypherpunk approach is the opposite. It's 'We're gonna make and break systems and we're gonna debunk things by finding weakness in systems.''' [Snip balance of longish feature article]

      This strategy requires aggressive and potentially
      controversial tactics as investigators infiltrate groups
      and bring charges on the basis of allegedly criminal
      plans that are conceived but not carried out. Federal
      agencies are more willing to launch investigations when

Cypherpunks does not seem to me to be anything like the well-
regulated lists you ascribe to Prof Volokh.
Could you, with Professor Volokh, expand on the application of "editorial control" on "unmoderated" lists? (See Netly below)
As well as amplify "the power to kick folks off a list ... if conversation veers too far from the list's charter." (See your quote below) Isn't this power the black heart of free speech racketeering? And what makes the glands of secret authoritarians thrill with benevolent suppression of assent on behalf of the disorderly, fuzzy-minded citizenry?
Media moguls and list runners share commonalities, to be sure,
but I wonder if it's not cruel to compare John Gilmore to Professsor
Volokh, and both to, say, Rupert Murdoch.
[Netly News]
Eugene Volokh, a law professor at UCLA, runs a number of mailing
lists and has kicked people off to maintain better editorial control.
Volokh says that the most valuable publications are those that
exercise the highest degree of editorial control.
[Your post of 11-13]
In my experience, and I've talked about this at some length with Prof. Volokh who runs a number of lists himself, the best and most valuable
discussion lists are those that are unmoderated but have a list owner who
has the power to kick folks off a list and can try to steer the direction
of a conversation if it veers too far from the list's charter.

"Well-regulated" means different things to different mind-sets.

minded about freedom of speech, they always give themselves
away by fanaticism about proper grammar and spelling and

Heed the complicity of God and Mammon, one person's butthole is another person's way to heaven on earth. As missionaries admit
about the joys of exotic lands and stray cat codes and wailing
The Occident is a prig, and overly addicted to a tight-laced definitions of propriety, heirarchy and rank. That's "well-regulated"
at its worst and meanest and murderous and censorious.

In addition to the recent successes against smart cards, there seems to be trouble with the government's program for widespread use of Fortezza cards, according to complaints of various military and civilian sites. The Fortezza

information could be gotten by the harried military users (see, for example,
the list of Fortezza complaints at  ).
Moreover, there is surely to be continued competition among the players
who are trying to increase their market share -- both government and
commercial, both domestic and international. Will they not continue to attack each other's crypto products? And will not each nation's government
continue to subsidize their favored producers in international economic and
military contentions?
The point is made on cypherpunks that the odds are increasingly on the crackers even if there are periodic gains by behind-the-scenes plots among
the enforcers and there temporary allies (as Tim notes, these are often short-

Thanks for the steady-hand reassurance. Your papers are balm.
Was it not Hal's original ironic lament about the current charade -- that
it's business as usual among the jaded insiders who are confident that they know how power really works.
The disdain for public accountability -- cynical extension of declared emegencies well past their time -- is what breeds the desire of outsiders

October 1996
Since the end of 1995 the central banks of the Group of Ten (G-10) countries have been studying the development of electronic money and the various policy issues which it raises. Much of this work has been carried out by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) or by monetary policy experts from G-10 central banks. Electronic money was discussed by BIS member central banks at meetings in Basle in July and September 1996. In August, the BIS published a report on the Security of Electronic Money prepared by the CPSS and the Group of Computer Experts.
This report provides a definition of electronic money and a description of its key features. It discusses the factors influencing the development of e-money products. Finally, it reviews the policy issues raised by e-money developments, as seen from a central bank perspective, and discusses the possible policy responses.

Dear Mr. Young:
I am writing to you as general counsel of Telecommunications
Industry Association ("TIA") which, as you may know, is
engaged in the formulation and publication of standards in
the communications field. At the request of our client, on
November 26, 1996, I accessed your WEB site and both viewed
and printed out a list of links to documents dealing with
encryption. Among them were documents described as a CAVE
Report, CAVE Table and a CAVE Algorithm dated November 20
and November 21, 1996.
In this fashion I was also able to view and print out the
algorithm document of TIA's Committee TR45.3, with a clear
statement that the information in the document may be
subject to the export juristiction of the U. S. Department
of State under the applicable regulations.
The posting on the WEB site of these documents is, in our
opinion, a violation of the copyright of TIA and unlawful.
Furthermore, the posting of the algorithm may constitute a
violation of applicable export regulations. It seems in any
event that it will be a violation under regulations to be
drafted pursuant to the President's Executive Order of
November 15, 1996 which was also accessed by me on your WEB
I returned to the site last Friday and yesterday, December 2
and noticed that these documents are no longer there. I
commend you removing them, but ask for your assurances that
they will not be posted again. In addition, it is important
that we know how you received this documentation which is
strictly restricted in its circulation.
I would appreciate hearing from you at your very earliest

Compromise on Encryption Exports Seems to Unravel
"We really feel that there has been a bait and switch situation and I'm not going to be silent about it," said Roel Pieper, chief executive and vice chairman of Tandem Computers. A Nov. 15 executive order that transferred export oversight to Commerce contained several new wrinkles that even previous industry supporters consider potential deal breakers. For one thing, the Justice Department would play a consulting role to the Commerce Department, which industry executives see as giving law-enforcement officials too big a role in the export process. And they contend that the order prescribes a system that might enable law-enforcement officials to unscramble messages while they are being transmitted, rather than after the fact, as the IBM compromise had seemed to specify.

The Advent of Netwar.
J. Arquilla, D.F. Ronfeldt
118 pp, 1996. $15.00 ISBN: 0833024140
Key concepts:
   Cybernetics -- Military aspects;    Electronic intelligence;    Military art and science -- Technological innovations;
   Communications, Military -- Technological aspects;    Electronic countermeasures Abstract: The information revolution is leading to the rise of network forms of organization, with unusual implications for how societies are organized and conflicts are conducted. "Netwar" is an emerging consequence. The term refers to societal conflict and crime, short of war, in which the protagonists are organized more as sprawling "leaderless" networks than as tight-knit hierarchies. Many terrorists, criminals, fundamentalists, and ethno-nationalists are developing netwar capabilities. A new generation of revolutionaries and militant radicals is also emerging, with new doctrines, strategies, and technologies that support their reliance on network forms of organization. Netwar may be the dominant mode of societal conflict in the 21st century. These conclusions are implied by the evolution of societies, according to a framework presented in this RAND study. The emergence of netwar raises the need to rethink strategy and doctrine to conduct counternetwar. Traditional notions of war and low-intensity conflict as a sequential process based on massing, maneuvering, and fighting will likely prove inadequate to cope with nonlinear, swarm-like, information-age conflicts in which societal and military elements are closely intermingled.

@_subject: FIPS key recovery meeting (long) 
Forward from: cyberia-l
        John Taber and I attended the first meeting of the technical
advisory committee to develop a Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIP) for the federal "key management infrastructure."  The meeting was
held December 5 and 6, 1996 near the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.  Although
the official documents referred only to "key recovery" instead of "key
escrow", representatives used both terms interchangeably.
        The committee is an advisory body to the Dept. of Commerce. Its
recommendations pass through the National Institute of Technical Standards
(NIST).  The charter states membership will be no more than 24, so the ten
"federal liaisons" present are apparently not considered members of the
committee.  The chairman is Stephen Kent, chief scientist for information
security at BBN Systems.
        The other members of the committee were employees of various
computer and computer-security firms, including Sun Microsystems,
Microsoft, Intel, Lucent Technologies, Cisco Systems, Digital Equipment,
IBM and Motorola.  Some security related firms were Trusted Systems,
GlobalKey, and CygnaCom.  Officials from Chase Manhattan Bank and Visa
were also present.  The only academic member was Dorothy Denning of
Georgetown University.
        The government liaisons included Michael Gilmore of the FBI, Jan
Manning of NSA, and representatives of NIST, the Federal Reserve Bank, and
the Defense Information Systems Agency.  Some representatives were from
agencies having no apparent need for cryptography, and therefore key
recovery, such as the Small Business Administration and the Social
Security Administration.  Kent later questioned why the SBA would need key
recovery when it had no need to store encrypted data.  SSA needs
encryption only when it receives confidential information over insecure
        Mary Good of the Commerce Department opened the meeting with a
speech charging the committee to develop a federal key-recovery standard
that can be extended to "public policy".  Good urged the committee to
confine itself to technical issues only, and arrive at a standard that
could be implemented and would not be merely theoretical.  Good also asked
for "transparency" in key recovery, and a couple of the government
liaisons mentioned this as well.  Kent's opening remarks included the
comment that the FIPS would only deal with crypto key recovery, not
recovery of digital signatures, or with public key certification.
        Most of the rest of the first day was taken up with introductions
and comments by the members and liaisons.  The general tenor of comments
from corporate representatives was that key recovery had not been
important to their customers, and while they did not oppose a key recovery
standard for the government, they did oppose any effort to make it
mandatory or make it a requirement for export.  Some differed on whether
an export requirement would be a problem.
        Some typical comments follow.  GlobalKey (which runs a private
encrypted mail system) said using key escrow would be against is policy,
and its customers would not accept it.  Oracle stated it had had no
requirement for key escrow from customers and saw no need for key escrow
from its customers.  It supported software-only solutions, and emphasized
they must have no classified content.  Motorola stated it was important
not to impact the performance of wireless systems.  Motorola advocated an
open system supporting multiple algorithms and opposed the trusted
third-party concept.  Microsoft said it was pragmatic, willing to provide
key recovery if customers want it, but it definitely does not want it
mandated, nor tied in with export licensing.  The Digicom member assumed
the committee was not concerned with individual privacy rights vis-a-vis
the corporate employer's power to recover an employee's encrypted message.
        Jan Manning of NSA and Patricia Edfors of Treasury said the
government had a corporate interest in key recovery like any other
business, as well as for national security or law enforcement purposes.
Manning agreed there was no place in the FIPS for concern over individual
privacy rights and urged the committee to avoid privacy issues.
        Kent said another issue the committee would face was the
timeliness of any response required to a key-recovery request.  Gilmore of
FBI says the FBI's need for timeliness would vary, depending on the
investigation.  Denning said that data other than law-enforcement related
messages could need timely recovery, citing encrypted medical data, or
encrypted data from some kind of sensor.  Another parameter for timeliness
would be the number of requests made in a given time.
        Although the issue was not explicitly debated, the commercial
members seemed to feel that key recovery should be directed to stored
data, while the government representatives were clearly using the term to
cover both stored data and communications.  Someone asked how session keys
in a communication system were archived, and Denning remarked she didn't
know of any system which archived session keys.  The following morning,
Kent said the issues included key recovery for storage, key recovery for
communications, and key recovery for staged delivery (email).  This seemed
to remove the doubts some members had about the scope of the proposal.  We
were left wondering how key archiving could possibly work in
communications networks.  Consider a system where encrypted packets arrive
in any order, with different keys and different key expirations.
        After a commenter asked for clarification of who the users of the
new standard were assumed to be, Kent stated:  "The government wants the
FIPS so that industry will produce products that government can use, and
others will use as well."  When another commenter pointed out that a user
could defeat a key-recovery system with superencryption or other means,
Kent said "...we have to be willing to let [that case] slip through the
        Some participants attempted to distinguish between key backup and
key recovery, the latter being the case where the parties to the
communication are themselves unwilling to give up keys.  Denning responded
that "key recovery _is_ backup."  The distinction seems to be about who is
a party to the communication--the corporation whose employee has lost his
keys, or the employee himself.  Confusion on this point may exist because
the members didn't distinguish the case where an entity using key recovery
doesn't care about it in particular cases, but another entity, government,
very well might.
        Kent asked if the new standard should require a data recovery
field in encrypted messages or files, and if so, should there be check for
integrity of this field.  Requiring a recipient to check this would
encourage senders to use the standard.  Someone asked how a recipient
could check if a sender were, in fact, escrowing data, even if the field
were present.  Others said requiring a data-recovery field would make
compatibility difficult for older systems, or "...those choosing not to
use key recovery."  Some expressed concern for the impact on system
performance of sending extra bits.  Miles Smid of NIST once referred to
the data-recovery field as a "LEAF," invoking some laughter from those
recalling Clipper's "law-enforcement access field."
        Following a question on interoperability with systems not using
the standard, Manning of NSA said the new export law required products to
interoperate only with products using key recovery.  This brought some
irritated responses from the commercial members.   One asked if the
government had some bottom line the committee would have to accept if
there were to be a FIPS.  Manning said NSA had some requirements, and he
assumed the FBI did as will.  Kent suggested the government side put
together a position paper.  A member then asked who the customers of FIPS
were supposed to be; given the government's special requirements, why was
industry input even needed?  Smid of NIST said industry input was needed,
or no one would build systems for the government to use; also, the
government may be involved in key recovery in commercial systems where
"...public safety is involved."  (It seemed plain that "public safety" in
this committee is a code word for "law enforcement").
        Kent suggested that if private parties want to operate
key-recovery services (apparently meaning escrow services), they would
have some negligence defense if they used a federal standard.
        On the following day, December 6, Dorothy Denning presented a
high-level schematic of key recovery associated with key fields and
encrypted data.  The schematic was thrown together the night before.  She
promised to make it available on her web page
        Patricia Edfors of Treasury spoke about federal public key
infrastructure pilot projects.  She also described an "Emergency Access
Demonstration Project," which was to "demonstrate the viability of key
recovery, as a security service, for federal business applications."  The
project is to last 9-15 months, beginning August 1996.  There will
apparently be participation between certain government agencies and some
private firm.  Edfors said no attempt would be made to recover digital
signature keys, create a key management infrastructure, or mandate which
cryptography is used.  However, "export requirements" will apply to all
        Kent wondered why the government would need key recovery for
itself. He seemed to feel that key recovery for an individual's worksation
is a data protection issue (backups) rather than true key recovery.
Members mentioned a few cases where an employee was unable to decrypt his
files, but no one knew of a case where an organization was unable to
obtain shared data (e.g., a database), because it was encrypted.  Other
members seemed reluctant to accept his distinction.  They seem to view key
recovery as a way to audit proper use of organization assets by employees,
or to protect the organization from malicious acts of employees, or to
recover data if a custodian is run over by a bus.
        Discussions continued to frame the issues for the project and
assign functional tasks for sub-committees.  Gilmore of the FBI said most
key-recover issues would arise (for law enforcement) in the context of
search warrants, not wiretaps, although the latter could be very
important.  In a question as to how long escrowed or archived keys should
be kept, Gilmore said as long as the data existed, which might be
indefinitely.  When pressed, Gilmore said this was because some crimes
have no statute of limitation.  We thought some members might be mentally
calculating storage requirements for session keys in a large
communications system, if key storage and indexing was to be indefinite.
        Manning of NSA said the National Archives, for example, would have
to have access to recovery keys forever.  No one asked why the National
Archives might be archiving encrypted data.
        Boland of GlobalKey also asked about keys to encrypted voice or video.
No one seemed to have thought of this before.
        Kent wrapped things up with a list of issues for discussion at
the next meeting.  These included:
        --the threat model
        --interoperability
        --key recovery agents
        --performance issues, computation and bandwidth
        --algorithm independence
        --enforcement measures
        The next meeting will be held in the San Francisco area on
February 19 and 20, 1996.  Before then the members will confer by email
and attempt to set up working groups to present papers on particular
        The meeting ended with an opportunity for public comment.  None
was offered.
        Our opinion was that the only reason for the existence of this
project was the insistence of the government, primarily the law
enforcement and state security agencies.  Private industry seems to feel
there is little demand for a key-recovery standard, since those needing it
can implement it themselves.  Industry representatives were obviously
worried about export restrictions requiring key escrow, and possible
attempts to make it mandatory in some way.  As corporations use encryption
more and more, there will obviously be a need to develop key recovery
systems inside the firm.  The justification for a federal standard,
however, seems weak.
        We felt that this project would probably end in failure, through
inability of the industry and government parties to compromise, or if a
standard did issue, few private firms would use it.  It's even doubtful
a standard could be completed and adopted before private systems are
firmly in place.  Is the whole thing just more of the government's
increasingly delusional effort to control private cryptography, or does
someone besides the security agencies really want a standard?

 "Industry Gears Up To Oppose Newest Encryption Plan"
 Opposition is mounting to the newest draft plan floated Mon.  by the Administration. One company representative called  the plan "policy extortion." Until now, most opposition has  come from software industry; some hardware  companies  are now starting to edge away.
 One rule appeared to expand types of communications  subject to key system, noting that rule said that products  referred to text of "encrypted data and communications."  That could be interpreted as e-mail. The document  showed that law enforcement agencies had the upper  hand.

  "Internet Markets: Emerging Business Models"
  By Dan Yurman
  December 11, 1996
  Abstract
  What are business models for profiting on the net?
  Perhaps the best metaphor to describe Internet business   is that it is like the California gold rush of 1849. A   wave of entrepreneurial start-ups have entered the field,   but all are struggling to find the gold. The miners are   going broke while the saloon and general store owners,   and the brothels, are prospering. Anyone who wants to   make real money in mass markets is going to have to   break the mold of "business as usual" and offer real   value which is not available offline. Meanwhile,   business-to-business commerce is growing using the   time-based value of data exchange as a pricing mechanism.
  This brief paper considers the business models and   related success factors which favor profitability for   doing business on the Internet. It addresses four areas:
  + Mass Markets
  + Business-to-Business Markets
  + Online Banking
  + Advertising

 "A hardware device may offer a solution to software virus

It consists of a microprocessor  on a small circuit board which is placed between the PC's  hard disc drive and its system board, and which functions  independently of the PC's own CPU as a second CPU. The  microprocessor can be programmed to monitor all traffic being  routed to the PC's hard disc drive. If it detects virus-like  activity or any other illegal activity it alerts the user and  allows the option of blocking access to the hard disc drive.
 The second CPU could also be allocated partitioned sections
 of the computer's hard drive to store all material
 downloaded from the Internet. Or the device could be used  as a firewall to prevent unauthorised access to the PC's  hard drive.

What was never certain in Phil's case, I believe, is how the
code got out of the US. Whether it was deliberately sent outside the
US by someone, or just made available on a US site which was accessible from outside the US.
The TIA lawyer who wrote me about TR453 indicated that there has
been legal dispute about whether mere placement of ITAR-regulated code on a US site, accessible from outside the US, means that
the code has been exported by the person placing it there (as I did
with the CAVE code on an AOL server in Virginia), or whether the
export is done by an accessor who is usually not be subject to US law.
The new regs intend to close that loophole, as Peter Junger states, and
as the TIA lawyer also indicated, that is, to codify the illegality of putting such code on a site accessible from "outside" the US, or by a "non-US person" inside the US. Heretofore, regulation has been by jaw-boning (as the TIA lawyer jaw-boned me about copyright villation of the uncopyrighted TR453).
This is the point about two definitions of geography in conflict -- physical
and electronic -- and how state-oriented law is attempting to assert control of the cyber-dissolving national borders. Similar to the struggle over electronic dissolution of intellectual property.
As a speaker noted in a recent Congressional crypto hearing: government-
aggressive law of cyberspace aims to define a nation's borders well beyond physical territory. As similarly argued against allowing "non-US persons" to
study regulated crypto in Professor Junger's class.
As others have noted here, other loopholes of by electronic reality are being closed by the new regs, even if First Amendment transgression But I'm not sure that the lawyers are not condemned to trail the leading edge of technology, as ever -- in crypto-munitions as in First Amendment and intellectual property betrayals, misrepresentations and rear guard actions.
Reading the new crypto export regs and comparing them to earlier incarnations is instructive. Observe those insertions of bits and bytes of contortinate intellectual labor -- never quite able to get the legilation to fit all the
looming permutations of technology -- unable, that is, to stitch the wounds of the stumbling, flailing superpower, unsure where the foe is located who is mortally undermining faith in the physical prowess of the keepers of the privileges.
Those vaunted inside secrets of nuclear-munitioned cops don't sell so well these days when the donut-dippers cannot be sure how to distinguish insiders from outsiders, and whose really in control of the armaments keys of keys.
Whole lot of shifting of alliances going on, from State to Commerce, or so I read in the quagmire regs.

@_subject: NYT: Faulty Crypto Policy 
The New York Times, December 16, 1996, p. A14.
   Another Faulty Encryption Policy [Editorial]
   The Clinton Administration has issued its third plan in as
   many years to keep powerful encryption programs for
   telephone and computer messages out of the hands of
   international terrorists and criminals. But this latest
   plan to control the export of encryption software, like the
   two before it, is unworkable and risks trampling on privacy
   rights and harming American software firms.
   Encryption in the hands of criminals unquestionably makes
   law enforcement hard. But the greatest use of encryption is
   by banks and other legal businesses that need to transmit
   confidential data without fear of interception. In
   legitimate hands, encryption helps to prevent crime.
   The Administration first sought to steer all Americans
   toward an encryption standard that Washington would design,
   thus preserving the Government's ability to tap phone
   calls. But after sharp criticism of Government snooping,
   the Administration retreated to a policy, still rejected by
   most privacy advocates and software firms, aimed at exports
   of encryption programs. The newly released regulations,
   which were supposed to implement the October policy, in
   fact make a flawed policy even worse.
   The one consistent thread through the Administration's
   plans is commitment to an encryption standard that uses
   mathematical "passwords" to scramble messages. The
   Government would then have the technical capacity to
   recover passwords, upon court order, and unscramble the
   phone or computer message.
   But the new policy will not succeed abroad. The
   Administration insists it needs not only to unscramble
   stored computer files but also to tap phone and computer
   messages, without the caller's knowledge, as they are
   transmitted. That would in effect require the foreign
   purchaser of American software to deposit its passwords
   with a reputable outside party -- a government agency, a
   bank or the computer firm from which it bought the software
   -- which would relinquish them upon court order and without
   notifying the user. What foreign company or individual will
   purchase software that is prey to undisclosed Government
   snooping when they can, buy equally powerful encryption
   from foreign firms that offer no such path for
   eavesdropping?
   The plan runs into other insolvable problems. It does not
   propose prohibiting powerful encryption software for
   domestic purchase, where such programs are constitutionally
   protected and already in wide use. Thus anyone could, with
   a few key strokes, send the domestically available programs
   over the Internet to Europe and beyond.
   The Administration also fears that software firms will
   write their programs so that the powerful domestic versions
   communicate readily with the easier-to-tap export products.
   If so, the technical result would be that criminals here
   and abroad could communicate out of reach of Government
   wiretaps. The Administration proposes to solve that problem
   by prohibiting software firms from providing easy
   communication between their domestic and export products.
   But that would make American export encryption programs
   unsellable abroad.
   A panel of the National Research Council recommended that
   Washington drop export restrictions on encryption software
   already available abroad, beef up the F.B.I.'s ability to
   crack private encryption codes and support private efforts
   to develop high quality encryption to stop illegal
   eavesdropping. Those steps will improve communications
   security and will not put Government law officers in
   corporate boardrooms, open E-mail to instant wiretaps or
   send foreign customers toward European and Asian software
   firms.

 On-Line Material: International law would specify that
 copyright protection includes the right to control the
 on-line distribution of copyrighted materials, as well as
 the right to prevent others from making unauthorized
 copies.
 "Fair use" -- the tradition of allowing individuals to make
 a limited number of copies for noncommercial purpose, or to
 use brief excerpts in news reports or artistic criticism --
 would still apply in cyberspace.
 In a compromise meant to defuse one of the harshest
 criticisms of the treaty, negotiators agreed to delete
 language that would have treated even temporary copies of

Well done, Lucky.
This is what's needed to kick off a lot of commentary during the next
45-days. Backed by research, to be sure. The outpouring of such
commentary on the full EAR from May 1995 to March 1996 shaped the
final document, and that process is an excellent case study for how
to affect the final form of the latest crypto regs.
It's worth perusing the full EAR in the Federal Register: March 25, 1996 (Volume 61, Number 58), Pages 12713 et seq. for 325 pages (well over a 2.5MB -- it's also on our site, see URL below).
Here's the portion of the EAR that Lucky and Kutz discussed:
[Page 12805]
Sec. 744.6  Restrictions on certain activities of U.S. persons.
    (a) General prohibitions--(1) Activities related to exports. (i) No U.S. person as defined in paragraph (c) of this section may, without a license from BXA, export, reexport, or transfer to or in any country other country, any item where that person knows that such item:
    (A) Will be used in the design, development, production, or use of nuclear explosive devices in or by a country listed in Country Group D:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (B) Will be used in the design, development, production, or use of missiles in or by a country listed in Country Group D:4 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or
    (C) Will be used in the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons in or by a country listed in Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (ii) No U.S. person shall, without a license from BXA, knowingly support an export, reexport, or transfer that does not have a license as required by this section. Support means any action, including financing, transportation, and freight forwarding, by which a person facilitates an export, reexport, or transfer without being the actual exporter or reexporter.
    (2) Other activities unrelated to exports. No U.S. person shall, without a license from BXA:
    (i) Perform any contract, service, or employment that the U.S. person knows will directly assist in the design, development, production, or use of missiles in or by a country listed in Country Group D:4 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or
    (ii) Perform any contract, service, or employment that the U.S. person knows directly will directly assist in the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons in or by a country listed in Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (3) Whole plant requirement. No U.S. person shall, without a license from BXA, participate in the design, construction, export, or reexport of a whole plant to make chemical weapons precursors identified in ECCN 1C350, in countries other than those listed in Country Group A:3 (Australia Group) (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (b) Additional prohibitions on U.S. persons informed by BXA. BXA may inform U.S. persons, either individually or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required because an activity could involve the types of participation and support described in paragraph (a) of this section anywhere in the world.
    Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. However, the absence of any such notification does not excuse the exporter from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Definition of U.S. person. For purposes of this section, the term U.S. person includes:
    (1) Any individual who is a citizen of the United States, a permanent resident alien of the United States, or a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3);
    (2) Any juridical person organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States, including foreign branches; and
    (3) Any person in the United States.
    (d) Exceptions. No License Exceptions apply to the prohibitions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (e) License review standards. Applications to engage in activities otherwise prohibited by this section will be denied if the activities would make a material contribution to the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons, or of missiles.

"Defence experts in both the US and western Europe
have commented recently that the US forces' lead in
information technology is growing to the point where
Washington may question the military usefulness of
Pointers to these comments would be appreciated.
Further, if the speculation of US supremacist go-it-alone
policy is correct, how might this affect:
1. US crypto export policy.
2. Crypto czar Aarons' role in promoting global GAK.
3. Other nation's suspicion of the US and its technological
prowess, caused, for example, by the NSA's avowed intention to surveil all the world's communcation, and if encrypted to crack it at any cost.
4. Increasing isolation of the US from foreign innovation and talent -- the imperialist incest decline.
5. The future of treaties such as US/UK/AUS, NATO, SEATO,
and the like for intel-sharing and crypto control.
Two observations:
One, last year's NRC crypto report said that strong crypto should not be a problem, and that other, unidentified, technologies should be supported instead to assure domestic and national security.
Two, the recent InfoWar-Defense report has been criticized as unduly
alarmist, because the US has sufficient means (Perry and others claim) to protect against information attacks. One NCSC commentator on talk.politics.crypto said that the IW-D techie panelists were out of touch, unlike Stewart Baker, a lawyer!
Hence, it might be worth considering that both the NRC report and
the IW-D reports are diversionary, disinformation to conceal US
true capabilities -- strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, the crypto debate itself might be diversionary from other more crucial information defense technology -- for surveilling, sifting, interpreting, analyzing, decrypting, mining and securely storing. As well as offensive means to counterattack US communications attackers.
Or, turning the matter one more time, perhaps crypto is in fact the heart of the national security problem and the avowed other, unidentified, more
crucial, technology is a sham to mislead about US and other government's
true weaknesses. The Commerce Control List is almost incoherent in
trying to definitively regulate advancing technology.
Paranoia may be increasing among governments due to the crypto debate
and related issues of information security, such that each may, like the
US is allegedly doing, retreating to within its own technological borders, while
at the same time engaging in PsyWar about threats, defenses and offenses.

A challenge on the ignored Ninth Amendment:
1-14-97. Washington Times, p. A14:
Why not just repeal the forgotten Ninth Amendment
Your Jan. 9 article on the "assisted suicide" issue argued before the U.S. Supreme Court does not mention the Ninth Amendment once ("High court wrestles with assisted suicide"). I was not surprised. Democrats and Republicans consistently ignore the Ninth (and appoint judges who likewise ignore it).
The Ninth Amendment states: "The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." By ignoring this plain wording, the judiciary displays a reluctance to "create new constitutional rights," an admirable sentiment. Considering that no one seems to take it seriously, perhaps we should consider repealing the "forgotten" Ninth Amendment.
After all, it seems to be written in invisible ink on just about every copy of the Bill of Rights owned by journalists and the judiciary. It is never the basis if deciding cases. Instead, it just clutters up the Bill of Rights and causes libertarians to prattle on endlessly about individual rights. I believe it would be healthy for this country to debate repealing the Ninth Although I am opposed to the idea of repealing it, I am just as opposed to the idea of ignoring parts of the Bill of Rights. Perhaps my proposed debate will cause some lawyers, journalists, judges and Supreme Court justices to reconsider their present Jim Ray

"At the New Frontier of Eavesdropping." Markoff.
  Many phone companies are now rushing to introduce new
  digital services that provide better sound quality. But
  when security standards were set for the new systems five
  years ago, technical experts from the Government
  discouraged the phone companies from building in coding
  systems that would be difficult to break. Moreover, the
  phone companies themselves decided that real privacy was
  not a major issue. "Time to market turned out to be more   important than real security," said John Gilmore.
  Indeed, in recent weeks the supposedly secret formula for
  scrambling digital wireless phone calls was posted to an
  Internet mailing list. That virtually insures that hackers
  will soon create a way to modify scanners like the one the
  Martins used, making digital calls just as vulnerable as
  analog calls are today. "There's a period in which privacy   prevails over surveillance, but it's never for very long."

"Defence experts in both the US and western Europe
have commented recently that the US forces' lead in
information technology is growing to the point where
Washington may question the military usefulness of
Pointers to these comments would be appreciated.
Further, if the speculation of US supremacist go-it-alone
policy is correct, how might this affect:
1. US crypto export policy.
2. Crypto czar Aarons' role in promoting global GAK.
3. Other nation's suspicion of the US and its technological
prowess, caused, for example, by the NSA's avowed intention to surveil all the world's communcation, and if encrypted to crack it at any cost.
4. Increasing isolation of the US from foreign innovation and talent -- the imperialist incest decline.
5. The future of treaties such as US/UK/AUS, NATO, SEATO,
and the like for intel-sharing and crypto control.
Two observations:
One, last year's NRC crypto report said that strong crypto should not be a problem, and that other, unidentified, technologies should be supported instead to assure domestic and national security.
Two, the recent InfoWar-Defense report has been criticized as unduly
alarmist, because the US has sufficient means (Perry and others claim) to protect against information attacks. One NCSC commentator on talk.politics.crypto said that the IW-D techie panelists were out of touch, unlike Stewart Baker, a lawyer!
Hence, it might be worth considering that both the NRC report and
the IW-D reports are diversionary, disinformation to conceal US
true capabilities -- strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, the crypto debate itself might be diversionary from other more crucial information defense technology -- for surveilling, sifting, interpreting, analyzing, decrypting, mining and securely storing. As well as offensive means to counterattack US communications attackers.
Or, turning the matter one more time, perhaps crypto is in fact the heart of the national security problem and the avowed other, unidentified, more
crucial, technology is a sham to mislead about US and other government's
true weaknesses. The Commerce Control List is almost incoherent in
trying to definitively regulate advancing technology.
Paranoia may be increasing among governments due to the crypto debate
and related issues of information security, such that each may, like the
US is allegedly doing, retreating to within its own technological borders, while
at the same time engaging in PsyWar about threats, defenses and offenses.

2-4-97. Reuters:
Global group fails to endorse Clinton encryption plan Washington: An influential economic research group is preparing guidelines on computer encryption for its member countries but will duck some of the most contentious issues involved, according to a draft obtained by Reuters.
The Clinton administration, seeking to rally support for its controversial policy on exporting encryption products -- which encode and decode e-mail and other computerized messages -- failed to win an endorsement from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), although the group did discuss the
administration's approach.
On perhaps the most difficult issue, the draft guidelines do not favour or oppose a requirement in the U.S. policy that data-scrambling encryption programmes provide a way for law enforcement officials to obtain keys to crack the codes when necessary.
After indicating that governments should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of imposing so-called key recovery, the draft report said, "this principle should not be interpreted as implying that governments should, or should not, initiate legislation that would allow lawful On all the controversial areas in the draft, "the member countries of the OECD have strongly held views but they don't always coincide," John Dryden, head of the group's Information, Computer and Communications Policy division, said in a telephone interview from Paris.
Some countries see widespread use of encryption as a way to protect the privacy of computer users and businesses, thereby encouraging global commerce, Dryden said. But others see encryption as possibly thwarting law enforcement's efforts to catch riminals and global terrorists, he The guidelines suggest encryption users should have access to products that meet their needs. Government controls should be "no more than are essential to the discharge of government responsibilities."
Instead of reconciling the different views, the draft guidelines lay out competing interests and approaches.
"It's not in itself a cryptography policy and it's not an attempt to draft a model national law that we're encouraging people to adopt," Dryden said. Cryptography refers to products and systems used in The guidelines also suggest encryption standards and usage should be "determined by the market in an open and competitive environment."
"There's a strong view that the private sector should have the possibility to use information networks to the best of their potential in order to create growth and jobs," Dryden said.
U.S. officials who have seen the preliminary draft praised the guidelines. "They're an important and helpful step forward," Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said.
"They're helpful because they put down on paper the proper foundation for getting into this," he added.
Reinsch said most countries will follow the U.S. lead and require so-called key recovery features for law enforcement. Under the Clinton policy, domestic use of encryption is not regulated but the strongest coding products cannot be exported unless they include key recovery.
U.S. companies that have opposed the Clinton policy, contending it stifles their ability to compete with unfettered foreign firms, drew little solace from the draft guidelines.
"This is not helpful," said Netscape Communications Corp.'s public policy counsel, Peter Harter. Netscape and other companies preferred stronger language endorsing free-market policies, he said.
The draft guidelines, approved by a group of government and private-sector experts at a meeting at the end of January, still must be approved by a top-level OECD officials from the group's 29 member countries, including the United States.

Major Organizations Are Experimenting With Computer Chip Implants in
Humans, According to EE Times Special Report
Manhasset, N.Y., Feb. 4 -- The implantation of computer chips into humans and animals is now actively being funded, researched and experimented by major institutions such as Stanford University, British Telecom, the National Institute of Health (NIH) and major corporations, according to the first of a two-part special report published by EE Times ( Although the work is drawing fire from civil libertarians and conspiracy theorists, among others, many scientists and physicians defend the work for its potential to ease suffering.
"It's 'Total Recall' come true! Our in-depth look into this state-of-
the- art research reveals that the mix of electrical engineering and medical technologies to surgically implant computer chip-driven devices is here today -- a micro chip implant is simply one step beyond a pacemaker," said EE Times Internet Editor Larry Lange.
According to the EE Times report, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (Tokyo) recently developed a low-cost input device that can recognize human movement and convert it to commands for use in software applications. This device is expected to find its way into tools used by people with disabilities. On other fronts, the semiconductor research lab at Motorola Inc. is working on body-embedded electronic blood-sensors that may one day allow diabetics to measure their blood sugar levels without ever drawing a drop of blood.
The special report, appearing in next week issue in print and online, looks at additional areas of research and the differing reactions to it.

2-14-97. National Business Review, NZ (
USA: Industry Groups Blast U.S. Encryption Policy.
Washington, Feb 13 (Reuter) - An array of private-sector trade groups charged Thursday the Clinton administration's new export policy on computer encoding technology was a failure. Encryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software "key," are subject to strict export limits, although the administration recently relaxed the rules a bit. The new policy "does not adequately address the needs of either the American business community or the general public," the 13 groups said in a letter to Clinton dated Wednesday and released Thursday. Among the groups signing the letter were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Retail Federation, along with a host of high-tech industry groups such as the
Business Software Alliance and the Information Technology Association of America. The Centre for Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group for civil liberties in cyberspace, and the Association of Research Libraries also signed the letter. An administration spokeswoman said that, despite the complaints, the current policy would be maintained. "The administration is moving ahead with our encryption export liberalisation policy," spokeswoman Heidi Kukis said. The policy balances diverse interests by "allowing us to develop exports while protecting our national security," she said. The administration has repeatedly said it opposes allowing unfettered powerful encryption programmes out of the country where they could be used by international criminals and terrorists. Under current policy, U.S. companies cannot export products containing so-called strong encryption, used to protect everything from a business' electronic mail to a consumer's credit card number sent over the Internet,
unless the products also allow the government to crack the code by recovering the software keys. Companies can get a license to export medium-strength encryption lacking so-called key recovery features if the companies agree to incorporate key recovery in future products within two years. The Commerce Department has issued three licenses so far under the two-year provision. Digital Equipment Corp., Trusted Information Systems Inc., and Cylink Corp. won approval by promising to offer key recovery
products by 1999. International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett Packard Co. have said they are also seeking licenses. But companies and privacy advocates rejected the administration's key recovery-based approach. "It fails to accommodate the competitiveness concerns of sellers of encryption products, the security concerns of the buyers of such products, or important privacy rights," the groups said in their letter. "We believe a fundamental rethinking of this policy is necessary," they added. "We remain interested in working with you to achieve a constructive solution to this very difficult problem." Congress is already considering proposals to dramatically relax the export restrictions without requiring key recovery.

There seems be sustained investigation of DFA, offensive and defensive,
by Biham and Shamir, by Anderson and Kuhn, by the Bellcore team, by Quisquater and others.
However, the smartcard manufacturers appear to have a role in dampening publicity about the ongoing research, or at least diminishing the claims of effectiveness of DFA. Carol Francher, of Motorola, for example, writes
in February IEEE Spectrum:
   Technology is a wonderful thing but criminals, too, can use it as new    equipment and techniques become available or less expensive the    barriers to cracking a system may weaken. Recently Bellcore    announced a paper, "Cryptanalysis in the presence of hardware faults"    (available at  that proposed a theoretical method for
   breaking an asymmetric encryption code once a computer (or a    smartcard microcontroller) had been forced into faulty behavior.
   The Smart Card Forum, a multi-industry membership organization    headquartered in Tampa, Fla., has stated that it does not regard this    approach as a real-world risk, since in smartcard applications more    than one technique is used to protect the security of the entire system.    But the Bellcore methodology for breaking algorithms -- as well as    similar theoretical approaches, such as the one taken by two Israeli    researchers, Eli Biham and Adi Shamir -- highlights the need to    analyze and evolve the security of any system continually.
   -- "In your pocket: smartcards."  Several of the DFA-type researchers have commented on the smartcard industry's reluctance to publicize security weaknesses when the push is on to increase consumer trust and use; see, for example, Anderson and
Kuhn at:
  Quisquater and the SG group also note the reluctance of smartcard
mass-marketers to own up to security shortcomings of which their own
engineers know and fret.
Meanwhile, the DFA proponents and opponents are eagerly absorbing the continuing DFA-relatged reports, quietly watching one another, and both sides eying the booming smartcard market for lucrative rewards, as Ms. Francher suggests: licit and il.

Three newspapers have pieces today on the new WTO
telecom agreement. A Page 1 NYP report examines the
administration's favoring of the once-moribund WTO over the UN as a principal means for "exporting US free-market values through global commercial agreements."
The telecom agreement, for the first time, allows the WTO
to go inside the signatory countries and check compliance, and
if warranted, impose sanctions, a role once reserved to the UN.
While encryption is not mentioned, it's worth watching the
WTO globally unite its privacy-invasive predecessors: the national tele-tappers. The spin is that now all governments can have access to the global (wiretap) network under guise of
enhanced commercial competition. (And that's why Commerce was given EI for CCL.)
For related background, there's informative discussion on the encryption switchover from State to Commerce in the Defense Trade News, archived at the Dept of State Web site.

Here're wee additions to your archive:
I subbed to cp-unedited from the first, so could compare the unedited messages with the edited. Some of mine(*) were edited, including a few
on the Stronghold topic. But to me that's not as big a deal as some want
to make of it.
For example, in response to Tim's request to repost DV's Stronghold ploy, I did so, and it was edited. Sandy sent me a courteous email stating that he was not forwarding the message. I answered that that was okay with me because I thought that DV was using the issue as a ploy to undermine Sandy. Hey, there were no legal or other threats made to me, darn it!
Another of my edited messages stated that there had been good discussion
on the unedited list about DV's Denial of Service attack on Cypherpunks.
Another noted that DV had been admirably successful in drawing others into
his fight -- in support and in opposition -- as part of his DoS.
Another questioned "Who's Censoring Who?" and offered the opinion that "censorship" rhetorically exaggerated Sandy's moderation. (I still believe that's the case.)
For what it's worth, I oppose moderation, but favor experimentation, in
the recognition that humans are near-endlessly adaptable and near-
uncontrollable no matter what control mechanisms are employed -- anarchy
is the norm whether advocated or not.
So, I think the moderation experiment was a success, in that it has led to an unexpectedly constructive reconfiguration of Cypherpunks -- and not the last, that's for sure -- and showed that any archy is wishful dreaming of tortured
hearts and minds and loins.
A one hand applause to Dr. V and archy-demolishers for vibrating the c'punks

2-4-97. Reuters:
Global group fails to endorse Clinton encryption plan Washington: An influential economic research group is preparing guidelines on computer encryption for its member countries but will duck some of the most contentious issues involved, according to a draft obtained by Reuters.
The Clinton administration, seeking to rally support for its controversial policy on exporting encryption products -- which encode and decode e-mail and other computerized messages -- failed to win an endorsement from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), although the group did discuss the
administration's approach.
On perhaps the most difficult issue, the draft guidelines do not favour or oppose a requirement in the U.S. policy that data-scrambling encryption programmes provide a way for law enforcement officials to obtain keys to crack the codes when necessary.
After indicating that governments should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of imposing so-called key recovery, the draft report said, "this principle should not be interpreted as implying that governments should, or should not, initiate legislation that would allow lawful On all the controversial areas in the draft, "the member countries of the OECD have strongly held views but they don't always coincide," John Dryden, head of the group's Information, Computer and Communications Policy division, said in a telephone interview from Paris.
Some countries see widespread use of encryption as a way to protect the privacy of computer users and businesses, thereby encouraging global commerce, Dryden said. But others see encryption as possibly thwarting law enforcement's efforts to catch riminals and global terrorists, he The guidelines suggest encryption users should have access to products that meet their needs. Government controls should be "no more than are essential to the discharge of government responsibilities."
Instead of reconciling the different views, the draft guidelines lay out competing interests and approaches.
"It's not in itself a cryptography policy and it's not an attempt to draft a model national law that we're encouraging people to adopt," Dryden said. Cryptography refers to products and systems used in The guidelines also suggest encryption standards and usage should be "determined by the market in an open and competitive environment."
"There's a strong view that the private sector should have the possibility to use information networks to the best of their potential in order to create growth and jobs," Dryden said.
U.S. officials who have seen the preliminary draft praised the guidelines. "They're an important and helpful step forward," Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said.
"They're helpful because they put down on paper the proper foundation for getting into this," he added.
Reinsch said most countries will follow the U.S. lead and require so-called key recovery features for law enforcement. Under the Clinton policy, domestic use of encryption is not regulated but the strongest coding products cannot be exported unless they include key recovery.
U.S. companies that have opposed the Clinton policy, contending it stifles their ability to compete with unfettered foreign firms, drew little solace from the draft guidelines.
"This is not helpful," said Netscape Communications Corp.'s public policy counsel, Peter Harter. Netscape and other companies preferred stronger language endorsing free-market policies, he said.
The draft guidelines, approved by a group of government and private-sector experts at a meeting at the end of January, still must be approved by a top-level OECD officials from the group's 29 member countries, including the United States.

Major Organizations Are Experimenting With Computer Chip Implants in
Humans, According to EE Times Special Report
Manhasset, N.Y., Feb. 4 -- The implantation of computer chips into humans and animals is now actively being funded, researched and experimented by major institutions such as Stanford University, British Telecom, the National Institute of Health (NIH) and major corporations, according to the first of a two-part special report published by EE Times ( Although the work is drawing fire from civil libertarians and conspiracy theorists, among others, many scientists and physicians defend the work for its potential to ease suffering.
"It's 'Total Recall' come true! Our in-depth look into this state-of-
the- art research reveals that the mix of electrical engineering and medical technologies to surgically implant computer chip-driven devices is here today -- a micro chip implant is simply one step beyond a pacemaker," said EE Times Internet Editor Larry Lange.
According to the EE Times report, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (Tokyo) recently developed a low-cost input device that can recognize human movement and convert it to commands for use in software applications. This device is expected to find its way into tools used by people with disabilities. On other fronts, the semiconductor research lab at Motorola Inc. is working on body-embedded electronic blood-sensors that may one day allow diabetics to measure their blood sugar levels without ever drawing a drop of blood.
The special report, appearing in next week issue in print and online, looks at additional areas of research and the differing reactions to it.

2-14-97. National Business Review, NZ (
USA: Industry Groups Blast U.S. Encryption Policy.
Washington, Feb 13 (Reuter) - An array of private-sector trade groups charged Thursday the Clinton administration's new export policy on computer encoding technology was a failure. Encryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software "key," are subject to strict export limits, although the administration recently relaxed the rules a bit. The new policy "does not adequately address the needs of either the American business community or the general public," the 13 groups said in a letter to Clinton dated Wednesday and released Thursday. Among the groups signing the letter were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Retail Federation, along with a host of high-tech industry groups such as the
Business Software Alliance and the Information Technology Association of America. The Centre for Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group for civil liberties in cyberspace, and the Association of Research Libraries also signed the letter. An administration spokeswoman said that, despite the complaints, the current policy would be maintained. "The administration is moving ahead with our encryption export liberalisation policy," spokeswoman Heidi Kukis said. The policy balances diverse interests by "allowing us to develop exports while protecting our national security," she said. The administration has repeatedly said it opposes allowing unfettered powerful encryption programmes out of the country where they could be used by international criminals and terrorists. Under current policy, U.S. companies cannot export products containing so-called strong encryption, used to protect everything from a business' electronic mail to a consumer's credit card number sent over the Internet,
unless the products also allow the government to crack the code by recovering the software keys. Companies can get a license to export medium-strength encryption lacking so-called key recovery features if the companies agree to incorporate key recovery in future products within two years. The Commerce Department has issued three licenses so far under the two-year provision. Digital Equipment Corp., Trusted Information Systems Inc., and Cylink Corp. won approval by promising to offer key recovery
products by 1999. International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett Packard Co. have said they are also seeking licenses. But companies and privacy advocates rejected the administration's key recovery-based approach. "It fails to accommodate the competitiveness concerns of sellers of encryption products, the security concerns of the buyers of such products, or important privacy rights," the groups said in their letter. "We believe a fundamental rethinking of this policy is necessary," they added. "We remain interested in working with you to achieve a constructive solution to this very difficult problem." Congress is already considering proposals to dramatically relax the export restrictions without requiring key recovery.

There seems be sustained investigation of DFA, offensive and defensive,
by Biham and Shamir, by Anderson and Kuhn, by the Bellcore team, by Quisquater and others.
However, the smartcard manufacturers appear to have a role in dampening publicity about the ongoing research, or at least diminishing the claims of effectiveness of DFA. Carol Francher, of Motorola, for example, writes
in February IEEE Spectrum:
   Technology is a wonderful thing but criminals, too, can use it as new    equipment and techniques become available or less expensive the    barriers to cracking a system may weaken. Recently Bellcore    announced a paper, "Cryptanalysis in the presence of hardware faults"    (available at  that proposed a theoretical method for
   breaking an asymmetric encryption code once a computer (or a    smartcard microcontroller) had been forced into faulty behavior.
   The Smart Card Forum, a multi-industry membership organization    headquartered in Tampa, Fla., has stated that it does not regard this    approach as a real-world risk, since in smartcard applications more    than one technique is used to protect the security of the entire system.    But the Bellcore methodology for breaking algorithms -- as well as    similar theoretical approaches, such as the one taken by two Israeli    researchers, Eli Biham and Adi Shamir -- highlights the need to    analyze and evolve the security of any system continually.
   -- "In your pocket: smartcards."  Several of the DFA-type researchers have commented on the smartcard industry's reluctance to publicize security weaknesses when the push is on to increase consumer trust and use; see, for example, Anderson and
Kuhn at:
  Quisquater and the SG group also note the reluctance of smartcard
mass-marketers to own up to security shortcomings of which their own
engineers know and fret.
Meanwhile, the DFA proponents and opponents are eagerly absorbing the continuing DFA-relatged reports, quietly watching one another, and both sides eying the booming smartcard market for lucrative rewards, as Ms. Francher suggests: licit and il.

Here're wee additions to your archive:
I subbed to cp-unedited from the first, so could compare the unedited messages with the edited. Some of mine(*) were edited, including a few
on the Stronghold topic. But to me that's not as big a deal as some want
to make of it.
For example, in response to Tim's request to repost DV's Stronghold ploy, I did so, and it was edited. Sandy sent me a courteous email stating that he was not forwarding the message. I answered that that was okay with me because I thought that DV was using the issue as a ploy to undermine Sandy. Hey, there were no legal or other threats made to me, darn it!
Another of my edited messages stated that there had been good discussion
on the unedited list about DV's Denial of Service attack on Cypherpunks.
Another noted that DV had been admirably successful in drawing others into
his fight -- in support and in opposition -- as part of his DoS.
Another questioned "Who's Censoring Who?" and offered the opinion that "censorship" rhetorically exaggerated Sandy's moderation. (I still believe that's the case.)
For what it's worth, I oppose moderation, but favor experimentation, in
the recognition that humans are near-endlessly adaptable and near-
uncontrollable no matter what control mechanisms are employed -- anarchy
is the norm whether advocated or not.
So, I think the moderation experiment was a success, in that it has led to an unexpectedly constructive reconfiguration of Cypherpunks -- and not the last, that's for sure -- and showed that any archy is wishful dreaming of tortured
hearts and minds and loins.
A one hand applause to Dr. V and archy-demolishers for vibrating the c'punks
house the way SATAN did bigger shoddy piles. Two hands to TCM for more memorable quaking of structure-bunkered c'punks and others.

Three newspapers have pieces today on the new WTO
telecom agreement. A Page 1 NYP report examines the
administration's favoring of the once-moribund WTO over the UN as a principal means for "exporting US free-market values through global commercial agreements."
The telecom agreement, for the first time, allows the WTO
to go inside the signatory countries and check compliance, and
if warranted, impose sanctions, a role once reserved to the UN.
While encryption is not mentioned, it's worth watching the
WTO globally unite its privacy-invasive predecessors: the national tele-tappers. The spin is that now all governments can have access to the global (wiretap) network under guise of
enhanced commercial competition. (And that's why Commerce was given EI for CCL.)

Mike Cobb's and Peter Gutmann's tales of mixed signals from
UK and NZ security agencies on exporting crypto demonstrate the same conflicting policies of their nations' governments as do
the travails of Zimmermann, Bernstein, Karn and Junger with the
USG -- lacking clear regulations, the agencies try bluff and The US move to clarify and tighten regulations in recent ITAR and
EAR amendments surely will be emulated by other nations, as
promised by The Wassenaar Arrangement.
It is part of the major shift of responsibility for dual-use items from national security agencies to those handling economic security, and
the guidelines are not as black and white for commerce as they are
for state -- or at least not as yet strictly codified, regulated and enforced.
However, what is happening with crypto is happening with a wide range of dual-use items, as the half-century old national security policy undergoes a transformation into economic security policy, with
the pervasive impact on subsidiary procedures and regulations in security, armaments, intelligence, research, invention, manufacturing, law, finance, politics, education and so on.
Note that the World Trade Organization is supplanting the United Nations as a forum for dispute resolution (NY Times, 18 February 1997). For more on these State-into-Commerce policy deliberations see:

   Domestic CIA Snooping
   The CIA's assertion on its Web page that the agency does
   not keep files on Americans is not in fact true ["In the
   Loop," Federal Page, Feb. 12]. The agency opened a file on
   my client, Daniel Tsang, a political activist and librarian
   at the University of California at Irvine, in the 1980s and
   recorded his constitutionally protected activities.
   When we sued the agency, we discovered that no agency
   directives prohibit the maintenance of such files and the
   CIA lawyers made the extraordinary claim that it is legal
   for the agency to keep files on Americans, including on
   citizens' First Amendment activities. The CIA claimed that
   it is exempt from Privacy Act restrictions on such
   practices.
   While the CIA eventually agreed to expunge Mr. Tsang's file
   and promised to refrain from opening such files on him in
   the future, it refused to acknowledge any limitation on its
   authority to keep files on other Americans. It should do so
   now.

Report: Europe OKs Wiretap Rules
London (AP) -- Europe has agreed to establish international standards with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations to enable authorities to tap telephones and messages sent by fax, telex and e-mail, a London newspaper reported Tuesday. The Guardian newspaper said it obtained a preliminary agreement signed by European Union nations in 1995 that calls for telecommunications companies to provide security agencies with the key to codes installed in equipment sold to customers. The newspaper report could not be confirmed independently. The aim of the alliance between U.S. and EU agencies was to set a common standard for "international interception,'' the newspaper reported. Full details on the agreement are being drawn up by officials working in European Union committees, it said. The report said European officials drafted a memorandum of understanding after Britain warned that mobile telephone systems in the hands of organized criminals posed an international threat.

UK to join FBI phone taps
Richard Norton-Taylor and Alison Daniels
BRITAIN has secretly agreed with its European Union partners to set up
an international telecommunications tapping system in co-operation
with the FBI, it was revealed on Monday.
The agreement covers telephones and written communications -- telexes,
faxes and e-mail. To make tapping easier, telecommunications companies
will be obliged to give security and intelligence agencies the key to
codes installed in equipment sold to private customers.
Detailed plans are being drawn up by officials in a secret network of
EU committees established under the "third pillar" of the Maastricht
Treaty, covering co-operation on law and order issues.
Civil liberties groups, while agreeing that there was a need for such
an agreement to fight against serious crime, said the plans raised a
number of privacy and data protection issues and must be the subject
of a full public debate.
Britain is an enthusiastic supporter of joint action in this area,
which is conducted on an inter-governmental basis with no role for the
European Commission, the European Parliament or the European Court of
Justice. It is an area where the EU's "democratic deficit" is most
Key points of the plan are outlined in a memorandum of understanding
signed by EU states in 1995, which is still classified. It reflects
increasing concern among European intelligence agencies that modern
technology will prevent them from tapping private communications.
EU governments agreed to co-operate closely with the FBI in Washington
as they work out detailed plans.

1. Introduction
This document describes detailed cryptographic procedures for cellular system applications. These procedures are used to perform the security services of mobile station authentication, subscriber message encryption, and encryption key and subscriber voice privacy key generation within cellular equipment.
This document is organized as follows:
§2 describes the Cellular Authentication, Voice Privacy and Encryption (CAVE) algorithm used for authentication for mobile subscriber equipment and for generation of cryptovariables to be used in other procedures.
§2.1 describes the procedure to verify the manual entry of the subscriber authentication key (A-key).
§2.2 describes the generation of intermediate subscriber cryptovariablcs, Shared Secret Data (SSD), from the unique and private subscriber A-key.
§2.3 describes the procedure to calculate an authentication signature used by cellular base station equipment for verifying the authenticity of a mobile station.
§2.4 describes the procedures used for generating cryptographic keys. These keys include the Voice Privacy Mask (VPM) and the Cellular Message Encryption Algorithm (CMEA) key. Thc VPM is used to provide forward link and reverse link voice confidentiality over the air interface. Thc CMEA key is used with the CMEA algorithm for protection of digital data exchanged between the mobile station and the base station.
§2.5 describes the Cellular Message Encryption Algorithm (CMEA) used for enciphering and deciphering subscriber data exchanged between the mobile station and the base station.
§2.6 describes the procedures for key and authentication signature generation for wireless residential extension §2.7 describes the ORYX algorithm and procedures for key and mask generation for encryption and decryption in cellular data services.
§3 provides test data (vectors) that may be employed to verify the correct operation of the cryptographic algorithms described in this document. ...
[End CCA Introduction]
The related CCA Interface Specification "describes the interfaces
to cryptographic procedures for cellular system applications"
described in the CCA. Its purpose "is to describe the cryptographic
functions without revealing the technical details that are subject
to" ITAR.
The two Appendices A to IS-136 and 627 "contain requirements for message encryption and voice privacy for cellular systems" supplemental to those described in the main documents, the CCA and the CCA Interface Specs.

At the FC'97 rump session, Paul Syverson from NRL presented a paper titled "Onion Routing". The description of the system sounds very much like Wei Dai's PipeNet. However, the development team seems to be unaware of PipeNet
and the discussions about it that we had in the past.
NLR has currently five machines implementing the protocol. Connection setup time is claimed to be 500 ms. They are looking for volunteers to run "Onion Routers". It appears the US military wants to access websites without giving away the fact that they are accessing the sites and is looking to us to provide the cover traffic. What a fortunate situation.
They said that the source would soon be on the web page, but so far it has not appeared.

We've received from Anonymous a copy of a February 28, 1997, complaint against NSA by an ex-Sandia cryptographer:
     (41K)
The cryptographer, William Payne, was:
   project leader for the Missile Secure Cryptographic Unit    [MSCU] at Sandia between about 1982 and 1986.  The    MSCU was funded by NSA.  Payne designed and built    the hardware/software data authenticator for the US/USSR    Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for Sandia between    1986 and 1992. Payne held SECRET clearance when    Payne worked for the Navy, DOE Q clearance, crypto and    SCI access while at Sandia.
The document says that Payne was a source for the Baltimore Sun story on NSA's "spiking" deal with CryptoAG*, and other stories, after he was fired in 1992 for attacking the quality of NSA's cryptography.
It includes descriptions of agreements between Sandia and NSA, algorithms, critiques and procedures. A sample:
   Payne revealed to the public the value 31. "The algorithm    required stepping two of its internal registers at a rate many    times the data rate."     NSA believes that 31 is classified.  Payne believes that this is    classification abuse.
   Therefore, Payne issued a FOIA to NSA crypto-mathematician Brian    Snow also on June 10, 1996.

The President's February 27 report to Congress on
"Threats of Terrorist Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction"
      New or enhanced technical capabilities needed to counter
     increasingly sophisticated terrorist organizations include
     the ability to intercept advanced telecommunications, with a
     primary focus on wireless and satellite-based systems;
     improved tracking and physical surveillance technologies for
     weapons, explosives, etc.; automatic language translation and
     text/key word recognition; and technology to support
     surreptitious entry.
       Current research and development funding is not adequate.
     Additional funding is needed to continue work on an indepth
     chemical characterization of foreign explosives and for
     continued development of contraband detection technology.
     Additional funding would accelerate development in a number
     of key technologies, particularly communications
     interception, tracking, covert communications, and
     surreptitious access. These technologies are critical to the
     support of counterterrorism investigations, especially WMD-
     related threats.

This week's Spiegel has a three-page follow-up article on the CIA spy:
Der Spiegel No. 12 / 1997, pp. 34-36.
Espionage / "Dinner for Two"
  For almost three years, a CIA agent has pumped a Head of Unit in
  Bonn's Economy Ministry.  The US agencies' wild actions no longer
  are taboo.
The official Klaus Dieter von Horn, 60, ex officio is on the guard of
spies - the Superior Counsellor in the Economy Ministry is responsible
for the Arabian area.  As the head of unit VB7 - that concentrates on
Iran - knows, spies from the Near East, but also from other areas,
take a keen interest in the files on his desk.
Nevertheless, at first the official did not pay much attention to
Geoffry Plant's efforts.  After all, he was in diplomatic duty of the
big brother USA.  Horn and Plant got to know each other late in 1994,
and the American invited the German to a dinner for two every three or
four weeks.  The US embassy's IInd Secretary liked to chat about his
employer and kept asking even more questions about Horn's ministry.
He had Horn explain the political background of the Mykonos lawsuit,
and was interested in the Hermes credits to Iran.  When Bonn in August
1995 asked Iran to send two employees of their office in Bonn on
vacation without return tickets because they had been unveiled as
spies, Plant wanted to know all details.
Another time, he politely asked for a list of those firms that deliver
all sorts of goods, especially high tech, to the Mullahs' state.  The
Ministerial Counsellor remained courteous, but refused: He was not
allowed to hand over those papers, Plant surely knew that?  The
American did understand, but he would not give up.
Last year in May, he again invited Horn to dinner.  He was leaving the
embassy, he said, and on farewell still handed over a Montblanc pen of
almost 300 DM worth.  Also, he introduced his successor: Peyton K
Humphries, a diplomat working on Iran.  Plant asked him not to forget
that name.
That was for granted.  Other authorities were already awaiting the US
embassy's new second secretary with large interest: The German
intelligence agencies wanted to check if the Americans were willing to
continue the agents game in diplomatic undercover.
Because already in Summer 1995, after the first talks with Plant, wary
Horn had contacted the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) and the Bundesamt
für Verfassungsschutz (BfV).  Obviously, he reported, American spies
were assigned to him.
He correctly informed the BfV about the various meetings and also
handed over presents such as pens and champagne.  Then, as Humphries
queried him about the ongoing construction of the nuclear power plant
of Busher after his return from a trip to Teheran, Horn described the
US interest in full detail.
What was happening there, was a textbook case to the BfV agent
hunters: Spies from a foreign power wanted to recruit a German top
official.  It is the spy school's ABC to first give the source test
orders such as obtaining material from an open source - as in Horn's
case.  Also typical: The German was supposed not to talk to anyone
about the encounters, including US embassy staff.  Humphries: "There
are two competing camps."  The CIA and the embassy's economy department
don't get on well with each other.
After the German counterespionage experts had dropped all plans to
crack the US embassy that lies at the Rhine like a fortress at
Deichmanns Aue 29, or to tap Humphries' telephone, in this February
BfV head Peter Frisch talked to the head of the CIA in Bonn, Floyd L
Paseman.  Humphries, Frisch demanded, was to leave the country, the
Chancellor's Office and the Foreign Office were annoyed.
Paseman denied espionage, but assured that the CIA agent would leave
until May 30.  He insistently asked to handle the incident most
It failed.  Since Der Spiegel reported first details about the
snooping last week, the relations between the goverment and Washington
are not free from irritations.
In the US, comparisons were made with France kicking out four CIA
agents in 1995.  "Why do the United States spy out their friends?"
the Wall Street Journal asked.  "Shame", said the Chicago Tribune's
editorial.  Washington still treated Germany as an agents center like
"in the age of Cold War".
The timid in Bonn now are afraid of trouble with the big brother.  But
there also is relief.  Kicking the CIA man out gives the chance to no
longer treat espionage among friends as a taboo.
Six and a half years after re-unification and the end of the allied
forces' privileges in Germany, the Germans in the conspirative area
still are not the masters of their own house.  Still, some Western
agencies - the Americans at the head - act like in their own backyard.
Hortensie I, the BND's synonym for the CIA, and Hortensie III, as the
most sinister American intelligence agency, the National Security
Agency (NSA) is referred to, resemble the flower of the same name: a
shrublike plant with strong roots.
The "friendly agencies" are increasingly active in the capital,
Berlin's Secretary of State of the Interior Kuno Böse (CDU) reported
in February.  In mid-February, the heads of the Offices for the
Protection of the Constitution met in Bad Neuenahr to "re-structure
counter-intelligence".  "Focussing on the East", they noted as item 4,
"would not correspond to political reality any more".
Looking to the West shows surprising activity: More than 1,000 wiretap
technicians and 100 professional US agents bustle about in Germany,
security experts estimate.  20 intelligence officers are suspected in
the American embassy at the Rhine alone.
The friendly power's spies are in consulates, allied supreme command,
and barracks.  They try to recruit agents in Germany, they tap sources
without consultation, and whoever uses a telephone between the Alps
and the Baltic Sea must be aware that the NSA be switched in -
attention, the friend is listening.
Before 1990, the American eavesdroppers were ubiquitious.  They
maintained a listening post on the mountain Teufelsberg in Berlin, to
listen to East Berlin, and probably the West as well.  In Frankfort am
Main, close to the Zeil, there was another impressive listening post.
In the Lech plain near Gablingen, the Americans constructed a powerful
circular antenna grid - some 300 meters of diameter and 100 meters of
heigth.  Upside, they were listening on short wave to the Eastern
generals' orders.  What they were doing in the underground, has
remained their secret.
The Teufelsberg has been left, as the Americans moved further to the
East.  The Frankfort subsidiary has also been closed, and Gablingen
will be given up next year.
But the Americans' pride, their "giant ear" in Germany, will remain,
and it makes the ordinary wiretap look rather ordinary.  The site is
located in Bad Aibling, Upper Bavaria.  In an idyllic landscape, the
empire of Hortesie III extends immensely.  Gigantic antenna facilities
that in their covers rise above the plain like huge gulf balls are
eavesdropping Russian military.  Russian sattelites are tapped, the
telephone traffic directed to the formerly Soviet army is recorded.
Right next to it, in the German Mangfall barrack, resides the BND's
so-called long distance radio traffic site.  It (object "Orion") may
use the American antennae, nearly 100 eavesdroppers are analyzing the
cyrillic babel of speech.
But the peace is deceptive.  The intelligence empire NSA (estimated
budget: 3.5 billion dollar, about 100,000 employees) maintains a large
complex in Bad Aibling that is terra incognita to the German agencies.
By far, it is not just about the legitimate American safety interests.
In the midst of Germany, there is a control center for the many
American espionage sattelites that, according to a security expert in
Bonn, "long since do not only spy out the East".  The celestial bodies
of American origin circulating in close orbit suck in electronic
signals above Germany like a huge vacuum cleaner.  With encrypted
signals, Bad Aibling queries the memory of the satellites and searches
the collected phone conversations, faxes and computer traffic for
interesting stuff.
Until 1995 the site officially used the name of the NSA.  To keep up
appearances, then a US Air Force lieutenant colonel took over command,
the military flag is demonstratively fluttering in the wind.  But
still more than 1,000 eavesdroppers are working in the huge complex,
according to BND estimates.  Estimated 150 of them are directly from
the NSA that does the controlling and sets the tasks.
In spite of many inquiries, Hortensie III has strictly denied to
exchange all information from "non-military intelligence".  The BND,
they argue, can offer nothing of comparable value.
But it probably is more about not telling the Germans what they really
do.  If American and German security experts are right, European
companies are systematically spied out from Bad Aibling.
Years ago, US president Bill Clinton decreed American agencies to
larger commitment in economic espionage.  When the European airplane
giant Airbus Industries, of which Germany holds 37.9%, was competing
for a large Saudi Arabian contract with two US groups, the NSA
intervened.  It intercepted all faxes and phone conversations between
Airbus and the Saudis.  So, the Americans knew their opponent and
their offers were unbeatable - after all the orders valued at six
billion dollars.
While the British and French to a certain extend respect Germany's
souvereignty, the Americans, who had brought up the BND, behave like a
victor power.  They insist on supplementary agreements on intelligence
cooperation with "the allied forces".  Thus, the Germans must respect
"necessities of military safety" of Nato contingents here.  There is
much room for secretive manners in German territory.
In its "Westport" office in the East of Munich, the CIA until now
maintains a so-called inquiry office.  The Americans ask
asylum-seeking refugees and emigrants from whom they expect
informaition to come to Munich from all Germany.  Pro forma, the BND
is asked for endorsement, but the talks usually take place without
German participation, and the BND does not learn about possible CIA
The Americans are questioning deserted Russian soldiers, war refugees
from former Yugoslavia, and asylum-seekers from the Near East.  The
VIPs of them are offered asylum in the USA.  Even applicants from
overseas are brought to the experts in Munich for interrogation.
For a long time, German politics have ignored the activities of the
rogue agency.  In autumn 1994, the Chancellor's Office installed a
working group, strictly confidential of course, to get the American
and other friendly agencies under control.
Three ministries and three intelligence agencies were sitting at the
table, headed by Rudolf Dolzer, professor of international law, at
that time Head of Unit in the Chancellor's Office.  "What they are
doing here is not possible", Dolzer got exited.  "They must comply
with law and oder."
The group boldly planned to prohibit the Americans from interrogating
asylum-seekers without German participation, in Bad Aibling BND
specialists should watch the NSA, recruiting sources should be
prohibited.  After all - they concluded - espionage activities also
from friendly states are not politically protected.
In 1995, their will of protection suddenly vanished.  Distances
between meetings grew longer, finally the Chancellor's Office didn't
send out invitations any more.  Above all, the BfV that already had
created lists with names of suspicious agents was disappointed.
"Someone on the very top must have pulled the plug", someone from an
intelligence agency says.
It is dubious if the case of CIA agent Humphries will cause with the
Americans to change their policy.  At least, friendship with America
means a big deal to Helmut Kohl who does not consider the intelligence
business especially important.
The Chancellor is not even scared by the sinister NSA.  He does have
telephones that are guaranteed to be wiretap-proof.  Even when he is
on vacation at the Wolfgangsee [in Austria], the BND always installs a
device which not even the NSA can crack.  But the secure devices have
one important drawback: First the partner has to stop speaking before
you can speak yourself.
That is why the Chancellor to the displeasure of the security people
prefers the old telephone - a friend trusts a friend.

For details of the crack see the cryptographers' press release at:    The New York Times, March 20, 1997, pp. A1, D2.
Code Set Up to Shield Privacy Of Cellular Calls Is Breached
By John Markoff
San Francisco, March 19 -- A team of well-known computer
security experts will announce on Thursday that they have
cracked a key part of the electronic code meant to protect the
privacy of calls made with the new, digital generation of
cellular telephones.
The announcement, intended as a public warning, means that --
despite their greater potential for privacy protection -- the
new cellular telephones, which transmit streams of digital
information in code similar to computer data, may in practice
be little more secure from eavesdropping than the analog
cellular phones, which send voice as electronic patterns
mimicking sound waves, that have been in use the last 15
It was such eavesdropping, for example, that caused trouble
for Newt Gingrich when a Florida couple listened to his
cellular phone conversation in December about the
Congressional ethics inquiry.
Now that digital wireless networks are coming into use around
the nation, the breaking of the digital code by the team of
two computer security consultants and a university researcher
confirms fears about privacy that were raised five years ago
when the communications industry agreed under Government
pressure to adopt a watered-down privacy technology.
Several telecommunications industry officials said the
pressure came from the National Security Agency, which feared
that stronger encryption technology might allow criminals or
terrorists to conspire with impunity by cellular phones.
But independent security experts now say that the code is easy
enough to crack that anyone with sufficient technical skills
could make and sell a monitoring device that would be as easy
to use as a police scanner is.
Such a device would enable a listener to scan hundreds of
wireless channels to listen in randomly on any digital call
within a radius ranging from 1,000 feet to a number of miles.
Or, as with current cellular technology, if a specific person
was the target of an eavesdropper, the device could be
programmed to listen for any nearby digital call to that
person's telephone number.
Other possible transgressions would include using the device
to automatically harvest all calling card or credit-card data
transmitted with nearby digital wireless phones.
And, because of a loophole in the Communications Act of 1934,
making and selling such devices would not be illegal, though
actually using one would technically be against the law.
These monitoring devices are not yet available, but security
experts said that a thriving gray market was certain to
develop. And with technical details of the security system
already circulating on the Internet instructions for cracking
it will almost certainly make their way into the computer
underground, where code breaking and eavesdropping are pursued
for fun and profit.
Technical details of the security system were supposed to be
a closely guarded secret, known only to a tight circle of
industry engineers. But the researchers performed their work
based on technical documents that were leaked from within the
communications industry and disseminated over the Internet
late last year.
"The industry design process is at fault," said David Wagner,
a University of California at Berkeley researcher who was a
member of the team that broke the code. "We can use this as a
lesson, and save ourselves from more serious vulnerabilities
in the future."
Communications industry technical experts, made aware of the
security flaw earlier this year, have been meeting to
determine whether it is too late to improve the system's
privacy protections. Already the digital technology is in use
in metropolitan areas, including New York and Washington,
where either the local cellular networks have been modified to
support digital technology or where new so called wireless
personal communications services are being offered.
"We're already in the process of correcting this flaw," said
Chris Carroll, an engineer at GTE Laboratories, who is
chairman of the industry committee that oversees privacy
standards for cellular phones.
But Greg Rose, a software designer for the Qualcomm Inc. a
leader in digital cellular systems said that fixing the flaw
would be "a nightmare." Tightening the security system, Mr.
Rose said, would involve modifying software already used in
the computerized network switching equipment that routes
wireless digital telephone calls, as well as the software
within individual phones.
Currently, about 45 million Americans have cellular phones,
though most of them so far are based on an older analog
standard that offers no communications privacy. But cellular
companies are gradually converting their networks to the new
digital standard, and the new personal communications services
networks going into operation around the country also employ
the digital encryption system. Nearly a million P.C.S. phones
have been sold in the United States, according to cellular
industry figures.
Besides Mr. Wagner, the other researchers who cracked the code
were Bruce Schneier and John Kelsey of Counterpane Systems, a
Minneapolis consulting firm. Mr. Schneier is the author of a
standard textbook on cryptography.
The new digital wireless security system, which was designed
by cellular telephone industry engineers was never intended to
stop the most determined wiretappers.
But because digital calls are transmitted in a format
corresponding to the one's and zero's of computer language,
they are more difficult to eavesdrop on than conventional
analog calls, which are transmitted in electronic patterns.
And digital calls protected with encryption technology --
basically a mathematical formula in the software that
scrambles the signal -- would be all the harder for a third
party to listen to surreptitiously.
Because the encryption system that the industry adopted in
1992 was deliberately made less secure than many experts had
recommended at the time, privacy rights advocates have been
warning since that the code could be broken too easily. An
announcement Thursday that the code has indeed been cracked
would seem to bear out those concerns.
"This should serve as a wake-up call," said James X. Dempsey,
senior staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a public interest group. "This shows that
Government's effort to control encryption technology is now
hindering the voice communications industry as well as the
data and electronic communication realm."
Industry executives acknowledged that steps must be taken to
address the problem.
"We need strict laws that say it is illegal to manufacture or
to modify a device which is designed to perpetrate the illegal
interception of P.C.S. telephone calls," said Thomas E.
Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telephone Industry
Association, a Washington-based trade group.
Mr. Wheeler said the weaker privacy technology had been
adopted not just to appease the Government but because makers
of wireless communications hardware and software wanted to
embrace a technical standard that would meet export
regulations. Those rules, based on national security
considerations, sharply curtail the potency of American-made
encryption technology.
The three computer researchers who broke the code belong to an
informal group of technologists who believe strongly that
powerful data-scrambling technologies are essential to protect
individual privacy in the information age. These
technologists, who planned to release their findings in a news
release on Thursday, argue that the best way to insure that
the strongest security codes are developed is to conduct the
work in a public forum. And so they are sharply critical of
the current industry standard setting process which has made
a trade secret of the underlying mathematical formulas used to
create the security codes.
"Our work shows clearly why you don't do this behind closed
doors," Mr. Schneier said. "I'm angry at the cell phone
industry because when they changed to the new technology, they
had a chance to protect privacy and they failed."
Mr. Carroll, head of the industry's privacy committee, said it
planned to revise the process for reviewing proposed technical

TITLE:	CTIA: Encryption of Digital Wireless Phones
SOURCE:	PR Newswire
DATE:	3/20/97 12:10 PM
                 CTIA:  Encryption of Digital Wireless Phones
    Today, a group of professional and academic cryptographers will announce
that it has "discovered a flaw in the privacy protection used in today's most
advanced digital cellular phones."  Following is a set of questions and
answers that arise from that announcement.
    Q.  Does this mean that eavesdroppers can listen in on my phone calls?
    A.  No.  The encryption discussed by the researchers involves the
algorithm used to encrypt numbers punched on the keypad of a phone, not the
algorithm used to encrypt voice transmissions.
    Q.  Is it easy to break this keypad number code?
    A.  Not at this time.  It involves very sophisticated cryptological
knowledge.  The digital encryption system now in use is designed to inhibit
interception by the unsophisticated.  Any technology developed by one person
can be broken by another with the application of sufficient technology.  This
announced attack requires multiple minutes -- up to hours -- of high speed
computer processing to break a coded message.
    0.  What is the impact of this announcement on people who now use
wireless phones?
    A.  Virtually none.  Approximately 95 percent of the wireless phones now
being used are analog phones, not digital phones.  The possible impact of this
announcement is only relevant to some digital phones that are now being
introduced to the market.
    Q.  Why didn't the wireless phone industry develop phones that have
unbreakable security?
    A.  Standards for phone technology are developed within the confines of
federal regulations and the realities of the marketplace.  A wireless phone is
a consumer product, not a spy v. spy technology adequate for national
security.  Such a unit would have cost, battery life and call set-up times
which would make it unacceptable to consumers.
    0.  Does this announcement have any impact on the industry's efforts to
stop phone cloning?
    A.  No. During the past year, the industry has been very successful in
introducing new technologies that prevent phone cloning.  These authentication
and "fingerprinting" technologies operate differently and are not compromised
by the cryptography announced today.
    Q.  What is the industry doing about this problem?
    A.  Tom Wheeler, the president and CEO of CTIA, testified before Congress
on February 5, about the need to strengthen the laws protecting the security
of wireless phone calls.  It is currently illegal to intentionally intercept a
wireless phone call.  Unfortunately, whereas federal law prohibits the sale
and manufacture of devices designed to eavesdrop on wireless calls, it does
not extend the prohibition to cordless phones and the newer digital
frequencies.  In regard to today's announcement, Wheeler said, "This is the
horse nudging at the barn door and it is time to act before the horse is gone

(Thanks to DAW for the CTIA and Schneier forwards)
Here's Bruce Schneier's press release rebutting the CTIA's assertions.
Forwarded message:
MINNEAPOLIS -- The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA)
issued a press release discussing our recent cryptographic break against
digital cellular phones.  Following is a correction of some of their
1.  While it is true that our paper did not discuss voice encryption, that
does not mean that the voice encryption system is any good.  As early as
1992 others -- including noted expert Whitfield Diffie -- have pointed out
fatal flaws in the new standard's voice privacy features.  The underlying
technology is the Vegienere cipher, broken by the Union Army during the
American Civil War.  One cryptographer was quoted in the July 1992
Communications of the ACM calling the voice privacy protection "pitifully
easy to break."  Certainly digital cellular is harder to eavesdrop on than
analog cellular--the latter just requires a scanner tuned to the correct
frequencies--digital cellular voice security can be broken in real time by
anyone with a little bit of budget, expertise, and desire.
2.  While our break did involve sophisticated cryptographic expertise, our
results have been published.  While we have no intention of publishing our
computer code, anyone able to understand our paper can implement our
attack.  It is not true that "any technology developed by one person can be
broken by another with the application of sufficient technology."  The
Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) could have designed secure
algorithms to protect voice and messages; they chose not to.
3.  While it is true that our announcement does not affect most people
because they use analog phones, that is a misleading statement.  Analog
phones are even less secure; the whole point of digital cellular was that
it was secure.  This announcement affects both CDMA and TDMA cellular
systems, but not GSM systems.
4.  The phone industry did not develop phones with unbreakable security
because they chose not to.  It is possible, with today's technology, to
implement digital cellular algorithms in cellular phones without affecting
the phone's weight, power consumption, voice quality, or call setup.  It
takes more computer processing power to digitize the voice than it does to
encrypt the digital voice.
5.  It is true that our attack does not affect phone cloning.  The TIA put
more effort into preventing cellular fraud, because that directly affects
their bottom line.  Cellular privacy is much less of a concern, so they
didn't bother doing a good job.
6.  All the industry seems to be doing about this problem is releasing
misleading press releases in an attempt to pretend that nothing is wrong.
One moral of this story is that good security standards need to be
developed in the open.  The CTIA believed that keeping the details of their
security measures secret improved the security of the system.  This notion
works, as long as the details remain secret.  All good security systems are
designed to remain secure even if their details are made public.  To do
otherwise is naive and foolish, similar to creating recipes without ever
bothering to let anyone taste the food.
The CTIA also pointed to the need for legislation to make this illegal.
While important, this is not a solution.  Listening in on analog cellular
phones is illegal, but people do it all the time.  Stealing cars is
illegal, but Lojack is still in business.  We need to protect ourselves
with technology, not with legislation.  Laws are a quick fix for an
industry unwilling to devote resources to solving their problems.

Excerpt of BXA head William Reinsch statement on Goodlatte's
SAFEncryption Bill HR 695 on March 20, 1997:
The Administration has stated on numerous occasions that we do not support mandatory key escrow and key recovery. Our objective is to enable the development and establishment of a voluntary key management system for public-key based encryption. We believe the Administration's policy is succeeding in bringing key recovery products to the marketplace. Our attention is now turning toward how we can best facilitate the development of the key management infrastructure that will support those products. To that end, we will shortly submit legislation intended to do the following:
  Expressly confirm the freedom of domestic users to choose any   type or strength of encryption.
  Explicitly state that participation in the key management   infrastructure is voluntary.
  Set forth legal conditions for the release of recovery   information to law enforcement officials pursuant to lawful   authority and provides liability protection for key recovery   agents who have properly released such information.
  Criminalizes the misuse of keys and the use of encryption to   further a crime.
  Offers, on a voluntary basis, firms that are in the business   of providing public cryptography keys the opportunity to   obtain government recognition, allowing them to market the   trustworthiness implied by government approval.

There does appear to be a coordinated global action to issue policies on TTP, GAK and the like at this time. OECD is due to shortly release its crypto policy, as is the USG according to BXA.
The FBI issued its wiretap payment plan yesterday. Herson
publically admitted the EU-FBI wiretap pact.
All are apparently guided by The Wassenaar Arrangement amongst
two dozen or so countries to act in concert, and to go public with
dual-use controls in unison.
So, Clint Brooks' comment at CFP about a new policy coming out

Rensch's statement to the House yesterday affirms.
It's a policy sure to appeal to nationalists and chauvinists: strong protection for a nation's interest and commerce with GAK; without
it no protection from predatory (rogue) nations (and criminals). But, as the Crypto AG engineer asked, "Who will protect us from NSA?"
And its predatory clients and contractors, the Germans and French and

The New York Times, March 27, 1997, pp. A1, D3.
   U.S. Rebuffed in Global Proposal For Eavesdropping on the
   Internet    By John Markoff
   In a setback for the Clinton Administration that
   demonstrates the difficulty of setting global policies for
   the Internet, the leading industrial nations have declined
   to embrace a United States proposal to allow computer
   eavesdropping by the world's law enforcement agencies.
   The United States proposal, backed by Britain and France,
   was an attempt to restrict the private use of increasingly
   advanced data-scrambling technology that can protect the
   privacy of electronic mail and other forms of computer
   communication. The equipment can make it difficult for law
   enforcement officials to crack a code when they suspect it
   is masking criminal or terrorist activities.
   The proposal called for international endorsement of a
   system in which mathematical keys to computer-security
   codes would be held by escrow agents from whom law
   enforcement officials could obtain the keys once they have
   a court's wiretapping warrant.
   But policy guidelines scheduled to be released in Paris
   today by the 29-nation Organization for Economic
   Cooperation and Development fail to endorse the United
   States proposal. And they leave such leeway for members to
   regulate data-scrambling technology--or not--that computer
   security experts say any uniform international policy
   remains elusive.
   "The difficulty with the guidelines is that anybody can
   interpret parts of them in their own way," said Konstantine
   Papanikdaw, a policy analyst for information security at
   the European Commission in Brussels.
   Indeed, the industrial world seems to be deeply divided on
   whether governments can ever legitimately eavesdrop on the
   electronic communication of their citizens. Because
   messages on the Internet are easy to intercept, a growing
   number of individuals and corporations are protecting the
   privacy of their communications and the security of their
   commercial transactions by scrambling such information.
   Some O.E.C.D. nations, including Britain and France, have
   either outlawed or are in the process of tightly regulating
   the private use of data-scrambling systems. But other
   nations--including Australia, Canada Denmark and
   Finland--have policies that protect individual privacy.
   Among other member nations, Japan had initially resisted
   the United States proposal but was said to be moving closer
   to it, while Germany remained deeply divided.
   Most other countries, inside or outside the O.E.C.D., have
   yet to confront the data-scrambling issue. And even the
   United States has a somewhat contradictory national policy
   that permits citizens to use whatever data-scrambling
   software they wish within the nation's borders, but
   restricts the export of the most up-to-date computer-coding
   technology.
   That seeming contradiction, however, did not prevent the
   Clinton Administration in recent months from waging a
   vigorous behind-the-scenes effort for its proposal. And
   hoping to resolve some of the policy conflicts, the
   Administration is now circulating draft legislation on
   Capitol Hill which would attempt to control even the
   domestic use of data-scrambling software and establish a
   key-escrow system for the United States.
   While the O.E.C.D. has no authority to set international
   policy, its recommendations are frequently used by member
   nations in setting their own foreign and trade policies.
   And the privacy and law-enforcement aspects of the Internet
   are issues on which member governments have been desperate
   for guidance.
   But even though most of the O.E.C.D. discussions involved
   law enforcement officials, who have been the main advocates
   for measures that would insure their ability to crack
   codes, European officials say that there was never much
   agreement on what to do.
   And so the primary recommendation in the report, a copy of
   which was obtained by The New York Times, simply gives
   O.E.C.D. member nations the latitude to do as they see fit
   when it comes to data scrambling, which is formally known
   as cryptography.
   "National cryptography policies may allow lawful access to
   plain text, or cryptographic keys, or encrypted data," the
   report says.
   Privacy-rights advocates see the O.E.C.D. guidelines as a
   critical setback for the Clinton Administration. "The U.S.
   proposal to endorse lawful access to private keys was
   explicitly rejected by the O.E.C.D. member countries," said
   Marc Rotenberg of the Washington-based Electronic Privacy
   Information Center and a member of the O.E.C.D.'s advisory
   group. "The O.E.C.D. chose instead a policy based on
   voluntary, market-driven development of cryptography
   products."
   And even supporters of the United States position
   acknowledged that guidelines were a disappointment.
   "The United States probably had more success raising
   consciousness then getting language that could he treated
   as an endorsement for key recovery," said Stewart Baker, a
   former National Security Agency official who participated
   on the American delegation to the O.E.C.D.
   Meanwhile, executives for the United States computer
   industry were critical of the O.E.C.D. for even leaving the
   door open for governments to set national policies on data
   scrambling.
   "We think that markets, not governments, should be the
   primary determinants of technology solutions," said Jon
   Englund, a vice president at the Information Technology
   Association of America, a trade group.
   Many experts question whether governments can ever hope to
   insure law enforcement access to electronic messages or to
   restrict the spread of super-strong coding software,
   because new, more powerful versions can always be developed
   and easily transmitted over the Internet in the blink of an
   eye.
   And any international effort is almost certainly doomed if
   some countries refuse to go along with a common approach,
   because people looking for strong encryption can simply
   acquire it wherever the laws are lax. In fact, the big
   German company Siemens A.G. recently introduced an
   encryption system that it advertises as being much more
   powerful than American companies can export under United
   States law.
   Besides the United States, France and Britain both support
   a system for enabling law enforcement officials to obtain
   keys to data-scrambling codes. France has already passed a
   stringent law that requires participation in such a system,
   although the rules to carry out the law have not yet been
   worked out.
   And in recent days, Britain has quietly circulated the most
   restrictive proposal of any nation, a domestic policy under
   which the Government would allow private use only of
   cryptography that was officially licensed, to make sure
   that the software uses code that law enforcement officials
   can crack.
   Under such laws, of course, criminals and terrorists might
   logically choose to use unauthorized encryption software.
   But the mere fact that such use would be a crime may be a
   deterrent--or give the police grounds to arrest anyone
   whose communications were indecipherable.
   In Germany, encryption remains a deeply divisive issue. The
   Interior Ministry has supported the need for encryption
   restrictions of some sort, but the Justice Ministry and the
   Economics Ministry have both signaled their opposition. And
   German businesses have been outspoken opponents against any
   new restrictions on data scrambling.
   Meanwhile, United States export restrictions have been a
   boon for Brokat Informationssysteme G.m.b.H., a
   two-year-old start-up company in Boblingen, Germany. Brokat
   supplies secure electronic transaction software for banks
   like Deutsche Bank and on-line services like America Online
   in Europe.
   One of Brokat's hottest products is the Expresso Security
   Package which essentially adds strong encryption to the
   World Wide Web browsers and Internet server software sold
   by two of the largest American software companies--
   Microsoft and Netscape Communications.

News Release --  March 27, 1997
DIGITAL TORNADO:
THE INTERNET AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY
FCC Staff Working Paper on Internet Policy
     The FCC's Office of Plans and Policy (OPP) today released a staff
working paper analyzing the implications of the Internet for the
FCC and telecommunications policy.  OPP Working Paper No. 29,
"Digital Tornado: The Internet and Telecommunications Policy," was
written by Kevin Werbach, Counsel for New Technology
Policy.  OPP periodically issues working papers on emerging areas in
communications; these papers represent individual views and are not an
official statement by the FCC or any FCC commissioner.
     "Digital Tornado" represents the first comprehensive assessment of
the questions the Internet poses for traditional communications policy.
A central theme running through the paper is that the FCC, and other
government agencies, should seek to limit regulation of Internet
services.  In framing his approach, Werbach states: "Because it is not
tied to traditional models or regulatory environments, the Internet
holds the potential to dramatically change the communications
landscape.  The Internet creates new forms of competition, valuable
services for end users, and benefits to the economy.  Government policy
approaches toward the Internet should therefore start from two premises:
avoid unnecessary regulation, and question the applicability of
traditional rules."
     After providing an analytical framework to understand the forces
driving Internet growth, and describing the Internet's development and
architecture, the paper addresses three primary areas:
     CATEGORY DIFFICULTIES
     Policy and legal questions arising from the fact that Internet-
     based services do not fit easily into the existing classifications
     for communications services under federal law or FCC
     regulations.
     PRICING AND USAGE
     Policy questions arising from the economics of Internet
     access, including assertions by local telephone companies that
     current Internet pricing structures result in network
     congestion, and arguments by Internet service providers that
     telephone companies have not upgraded their networks to
     facilitate efficient transport of data services.
     AVAILABILITY OF BANDWIDTH
     Regulatory and technical issues affecting the deployment of
     technologies promising to enable high-speed Internet access to
     the home and to businesses, including the implications for the
     Internet of the FCC's role in promoting universal service.

As noted here on April 2, we've put on our Web site several of
the docs of the Peter Junger suit against the Secretary of State:
   One gives parts of Peter's article "Computers and the Law" which includes machine-readable code, code which is prohibited by the EAR from being placed on the Internet without a license (it is this "prior restraint" that Peter is challenging):
   When Peter saw that I had put the article and code on my site,
he telephoned immediately to say that the article should not have been sent to me along with the other material. He asked that it be removed because electronic publication could harm his case and
put me at risk of prosecution.
After discussion I declined to remove it, and thanked him for his Yesterday, Richard Vasvari, one of Peter's three attorneys, called
to politely ask that I remove the doc. And further explained how its electronic publication could harm the case and put me at risk. He said that he had notified Anthony Coppolino, DoJ, that the document was on the Web, as he was obliged to do by procedural rules. That they had discussed the ramifications. He did not say what DoJ intended
to do.
And, that he was obliged as an attorney to advise me to retain an attorney
for my defense against prosecution for placing the doc on the Web.
During this discussion with Mr. Vasvari I checked the access log for the prohibited doc and saw that DoJ had accessed it as well as several other files on me and my org.
I told Mr. Vasvari this and he again advised me to remove the doc. Again,
I declined.
After chewing on this restraint of my publication by the attorneys, I decided to delete only the machine-readable code from Peter's article, leaving the  text which explains why the electronic publication of the code is the crux of Peter's First Amendment case. On the assumption that his prior restraint claim is more important than mine.
Take at look and let me know what you think. Should I have deleted the
code or left it in the public domain where it belongs? Am I right to comply
with the attorneys' first claim on prior restraint?
Meanwhile, anyone worldwide who want the article with the code intact, send me an email for instructions on how to get it.

@_subject: Surveillance 
Chief Judge Royce Lamberth of the US Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court spoke yesterday at the ABA's National
Security Law gathering. (On C-SPAN).
Points of interest:
Why the court is not involved in domestic surveillance with
the rise of terrorism and militancy in the US: It was considered during the implementation of the recent Anti-Terrorism Act but a decision was made to leave that task to District Courts.
Why the court has denied only a dozen out of 8,000 requests
for surveillance: All are excellently prepared and the judges advise on the few applications that are not to make them He went on to say that numbers do not tell the real story, that
there are a variety of ways orders are issued and continued to
keep an investigation viable and as it evolves. He cited the differences in renewals between orders covering individuals and those covering organizations: the first must be renewed every 90 days, the latter every year.
Moreover, there may be changes during an investigation, say,
by targeting an individual within an org, with difference regs, or
combining individuals into a group, with also different regs. So
the numbers of orders do not actually reflect how things work.
However, the Court makes and annual report to Congress.
Judge Lamberth joked that he hoped the Court's decisions
were "constitutional," and after the laughter, apologized and
said he should not have said that.
He said that positions on the court are avidly sought, that the
work was the most "fun" he had ever had, that it was very
exciting to be part of the select group that deals with the highest
secrets of the land.
He commented on how "Article 3" provisions to protect national
security and related secrets conflict with the FOIA, by saying
first things first.
A related note on Greg's fruitless FOIA requests to various agencies about cpunks: active investigations are protected from FOIA requests, indeed, it is not uncommon to keep an investigation "active" to keep the secrets, to redefine the targets, to redefine as
the Courts helpfully advise.
Be sure to laugh at the constitutional joke, it's fun to be an insider playing with vital national life and death decisions and amusing the audience on TV.

On December 13, 1996, representatives from The National Information Infrastructure (NII) Task Force of The President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee
(NSTAC) held a meeting at Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, D.C. to discuss industry interest in developing an industry-run Information Systems Security Board (ISSB). Stewart Baker of Steptoe & Johnson discussed the antitrust laws and their application to the meeting, with particular emphasis on the need to avoid discussion of competitive conditions and to show
openness to all interested participants. Guy Copeland, a representative from the Task Force, briefly discussed the ISSB model and the purposes of the meeting. Will Ozier, Chairman of the GSSP Committee, next discussed the efforts of the Generally Accepted System Security Principles (GSSP) project. Several representatives from the Administration expressed support for the concept of the ISSB. These representatives also indicated that the Administration would like private industry to take the lead in this area and is more than willing to take "a back seat" to such an effort. These representatives did request for periodic updates on any industry driven initiative in this area. For full report and links to background documents:

Excerpts of remarks by NSA head William Crowell to
NISSC96, October, 1996:
Key recovery may prove essential in making encryption scalable on an international basis. We are not the only country wrestling with the public safety implications of unbreakable cryptography. France, Israel and Russia recently imposed import and domestic use restrictions. Several Asian, South American and African countries have had similar restrictions in place for years. Others
may impose them as strong cryptography proliferates.
For many overseas, as well as here, the logic of the need to balance business imperatives with public safety concerns argues for key recovery. The European Union and other confederations are considering key recovery-based KMIs. The world's major standards bodies are designing future standards so that key recovery can be accommodated.
International standards and protocols for key recovery may prove essential to hand off national restrictions on strong encryption, to promote a broad export market for cryptography and to establish a key management infrastructure acceptable for general international use. This would accelerate the realization of the promise of information technology, and that would be in everyone's best interest.
Working in partnership, government and industry together need to lay the foundation necessary to sustain and strengthen information security for America. I wish to emphasize that the infrastructure for key management will be built by industry as a commercial venture. This task is huge. Collaboration among many partners will be essential if we are to establish a KMI that promotes the use of encryption worldwide.

@_subject: Competitive Betrayal 
Weekend FiTi reports on "the enemy within" corporations
and the growth of "competitive intelligence" as cold war spy tactics are adapted to big business. Excerpts:
Nobody in the surveillance business really knows how much commercial spying goes on. A lot of the eavesdropping is done, perfectly legally, by managers listening in to their own staff.
It is, of course, in the interest of equipment suppliers and
corporate consultants to maximise the dangers that companies
face. "All companies are paranoid about their own security,"
said the spokesman of one well-known British multinational.
"They don't seem to mind paying consultants to tell them
things they know already."
Yet all agree that the field of "competitive intelligence",
as it is politely termed, is an expanding one. The
privatisation of whole economies, the deregulation of
monopoly markets, the globalisation of business, the spread
of foreign investment and contested takeovers, the
proliferation of technology and the sheer volume of
information - all have made companies more aggressive, and
more vulnerable.
A consultant called in to investigate a theft may find
himself pitted against another. In order to sanitise the
business, a professional association called the Society of
Competitive Intelligence Professionals has been set up.
Its 5,000 members are meant to follow a code which vaguely
urges them to obey the law, identify themselves when asking
questions, and avoid "unethical practices".
SCIP is influenced by the Association of Former Intelligence
Officers, a group described as "very powerful" by Andre
Pienaar, a young manager at the corporate investigators
Kroll Associates who has written a doctoral thesis on
business and intelligence.
"Company information has become very valuable," he said,
"more valuable than physical assets."
Protecting that information is becoming ever more difficult.
It is not just the tappers, buggers and hackers who are the
problem, however. The problem is the loyalty - or lack of it
- of employees in a world of short contracts, rapid turnover
and big inducements.
Tony McStravick, former acting head of the Metropolitan
police Fraud Squad in London, has worked for Kroll and is
now at Control Risks Group. "It all comes down to management
in the end," he said. "Companies have lost the hearts and
minds of their employees because of performance pay,
delayering, downsizing."
"You have to have a culture of honesty, from the top down.
You must find the balance between maximising profits and
being fair and honest. A lot of the time, companies forget
they are dealing with human beings."

January, 1997
Appendix D
Special Procedures for Use in Systematic and Mandatory
Review of Cryptologic Information
1. General guideline: Cryptologic information uncovered in
systematic or mandatory review for declassification of 25-
year old government records is not to be declassified by
other than the National Security Agency. The information may
concern or reveal the processes, techniques, operations, and
scope of signals intelligence (SIGINT), which consists of
communications intelligence (COMINT), electronic
intelligence (ELINT), and foreign instrumentation signals
intelligence (FISINT), or it may concern the components of
Information Security (INFOSEC) which consists of
communications security (COMSEC) and computer security
(COMPUSEC), including the communications portion of cover
and deception plans. Much cryptologic information is also
considered "Foreign Government Information" as defined in
Para. 1.1(d) of the Executive Order 12958.
2. Recognition of cryptologic information may not always be
an easy task. There are several broad classes of cryptologic
information, as follows:
  a. Those that relate to INFOSEC: In documentary form,
they provide   COMSEC/COMPUSEC guidance or information. Many
COMSEC/COMPUSEC documents and materials are accountable
under the Communications Security Material Control System.
Examples are items bearing telecommunications security
(TSEC) nomenclature and crypto keying material for use in
enciphering communications and other COMSEC/COMPUSEC
documentation such as the National Telecommunications and
Information Systems Security Committee or is predecessor
organization, COMSEC/COMPUSEC Resources Program documents,
COMSEC Equipment Engineering Bulletins, COMSEC Equipment
System Descriptions, and COMSEC Technical Bulletins.
  b. Those that relate to SIGINT: These appear as
reports in various formats that bear security
classifications, frequently followed by five-letter
codewords, for example, World War II's ULTRA, and often
carry warning caveats such as "This document contains
codeword material" and "Utmost secrecy is necessary..." or
"Handle Via COMINT Channels Only" or "HVCCO" or "CCO."
Formats may appear as messages having addresses, "from" and
"to" sections, and as summaries with SIGINT content with or
without other kinds of intelligence and comment.
  c. Research, development, test, life cycle support,
planning, and evaluation reports and information that
relates to either COMSEC, COMPUSEC, or SIGINT.
3. Some commonly used words that help to identify
cryptologic documents and materials are "cipher," "code,"
"codeword," communications intelligence," or "COMINT,"
"special intelligence," "communications security," or
"COMSEC," "computer security or COMPUSEC," cryptanalysis,"
"crypto," cryptography," "cryptosystem," "cipher,"
"decipher," "decode," "decrypt," "direction finding,"
"electronic intelligence" or "ELINT," "electronic security,"
"encipher," "encode," "encrypt," "foreign instrumentation
signals intelligence" or "FISINT" pr "FIS"," "telemetry,"
"information systems security" or "INFOSEC," "intercept,"
"key book," "one-time-pad," "bookbreaking," "signals
intelligence" or "SIGINT," "signals security," "TEMPEST,"
and "traffic analysis" or "TA."
4. Special procedures apply to the review and
declassification of classified cryptologic information. The
following shall be observed in the review of such
  a. INFOSEC (COMSEC and COMPUSEC) Documents and
  (1) If records or materials in this category are
found in agency or department component files that are not
under INFOSEC control, refer them to the senior
COMSEC/COMPUSEC authority of the agency or department
concerned or return them, by appropriate channels, to the
address in item 4.c, below.
  (2) If the COMSEC/COMPUSEC information has been
incorporated into other documents by the receiving agency,
that information must be referred to the National Security
Agency/Chief Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) for review
before declassification occurs.
  b. SIGINT (COMINT, ELINT, and FISINT) Information.
  (1) If the SIGINT information is contained in a
document or record originated by a U.S. Government
cryptologic organization and is in the files of a non-
cryptologic agency or department, such material will not be
declassified. The material may be destroyed unless the
holding agency's approved records disposition schedule
requires its retention. If the material must be retained, it
must be referred to the NSA/CSS for systematic review for
declassification when it becomes 25-years old or older.
  (2) If the SIGINT information has been
incorporated by the receiving agency into documents it
produces, referral of the SIGINT information to the NSA/CSS
for review is necessary prior to any declassification
  c. COMSEC/COMPUSEC or SIGINT information which
requires declassification by the NSA/CSS should be sent to:
  Director, National Security Agency/
  Chief, Central Security Service
  ATTN: Information Policy Staff (N5P6)
  Fort George G. Meade, MD 20755-6000

  cryptanalytic systems to perform key searches,
  statistical, linear and differential cryptanalyses; and
  factor 110 decimal digit, or larger, numbers.
  Unique Software: Operating systems and applications for
  massively parallel cryptanalytic processors (> 16
  processors) specially designed to perform statistical,
  linear and differential cryptanalyses, exhaustive key
  searches and quadratic and number field sieve
  factoring.
  Control Regimes: WA ML 11, 21; WA IL Cat 5.
  2. Cryptographic Technologies (for keeping data
  secure):
  Critical Parameters: Due to the numerous variables
  required to implement an information security scheme
  and the wide range of products and services in which
  information security can be deployed this technology
  does not lend itself to specifically enumerated

  Unique Equipment: Computers of 10,000 CTP, or greater,
  and software specially designed to perform Randomness,
  Correlation, Weak Key and Symmetry Under
  Complementation tests to evaluate the strength of new
  USG encryption algorithms during development.
  Unique Software: The software providing the
  cryptographic functionality must be specially designed
  and integrated into each application. The system
  engineering and integration, user system interface,
  algorithms and key generators must have zero defects.
  Control Regimes: WA ML 11, 21; WA IL Cat 5.
The document states, "A high rate of IS knowledge transfer
from the US to foreign competitors occurs through open
source US trade journals, technical literature, various
international fora, the Internet and intelligence. As a
result, the US technology leadership in communications and
computer systems has declined in recent years relative to
Europe and Japan."

21 April 1997:
     US Govt Licenses First European Encryption Firm
     London: The US Department of Commerce has awarded the
     euro-encryption rights to Internet Smartware, a UK company.
     According to Internet Smartware, the agreement overcomes
     two major stumbling blocks which have prevented businesses
     from using the Internet for commercial use:      Firstly, European companies can now implement US
     developed 56-bit DES (data encryption standard) encryption
     technology, which the company claims is the accepted
     minimum requirement for Internet commerce, and beyond.      Secondly, companies will no longer have to give authorities
     such as the US government free access to their encrypted
     data.      Internet Smartware claims that the agreement also provides
     UK companies with an effective alternative to the recent,
     unpopular DTI (Department of Trade and Industry)
     encryption proposals, which recommend that companies
     must give "trusted third parties" access to encrypted data.      "Smart" Cash Cards Pose Law Enforcement Challenges      Washington: "Smart cards" that store electronic currency      have the potential to revolutionize commerce, but the emerging      technology poses challenges for the law enforcement community,      government officials said Friday.      "The same electronic commerce technology that will save
     time and money is also capable of being abused," said Peter
     Toren, senior attorney in the U.S. Justice Department's
     computer fraud division. Toren, speaking at a conference at      American University's law school here, warned that the cards      offer the "threat of the perfect counterfeit" because any criminal      that can copy them "can create an unending stream of money."      IISP Panel Addresses Cyberspace Payments
     New York -- Developing secure, cost effective and efficient      electronic payment systems is critical to creating a truly      global commercial marketplace, and efforts are already underway      to address the technology, business, regulatory and legal      aspects of cyberspace payments, according to speakers at a      March 25-26 panel sponsored by ANSI's Information      Infrastructure Standards Panel (IISP).      "Micro-payments, anonymous cash, `Smart Cards,' digital
     cash, electronic purses, and `e-cash' all describe different
     approaches to achieving a secure payments solution," said
     ANSI board Member Oliver Smoot. "As these new payments      evolve, standards to facilitate interconnection and interoperability      are critical."      Thomas J. Firnhaber, Policy Adviser at FinCEN, focused on      the potential impact of cyberpayments on regulatory and law      enforcement and provided an overview of the U.S. Department      of Treasury's Cyberpayments efforts to date. "The anonymity,      rapidity, volume and audit difficulty of cyberpayments has      challenged traditional investigative techniques," he said.
     Smart Cards The Next Wave - Report      London: Frost & Sullivan (F&S) has announced the      publication of a smart card report that predicts the arrival      of multi-function smart cards is almost upon us.      "Electronic Access Control" predicts that it will soon be possible      for a smart card to carry out credit and debit card transactions, as      well as holding details of your medical records, your frequent flyer
     mileage, your social security number, your address.      According to F&S, a threat to this technological advance may
     be the consumer concern for the loss of privacy and a
     potential Big Brother scenario. Who, the company asks, gets
     to access the information is an issue on the minds of the
     consumer?

22 April 1997:
     Space/intelligence technology's embattled frontier      European citizens and governments alike have expressed
     concern over the recent expansion of U.S. intelligence bases
     in Europe. The National Security Agency (NSA) and National
     Reconnaissance Office (NRO) are combining efforts at large
     sites known as regional SIGINT (signals intelligence)
     operation centers, or RSOCs.      At a recent Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
     NRO director Keith Hall said that the merging of the NSA and
     NRO bases is the first step in creating "collaborative systems
     of systems in signals intelligence." In the future, Hall said,
     those joint efforts could also include the U.S. Space
     Command, the service intelligence agencies and even
     commercial resources "borrowed" by the intelligence
     community.      U.S. military officials have been surprisingly candid about
     their intent to take maximum strategic advantage of their
     information trump cards. Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall      said, "Our allies must understand that we bring tremendous      capabilities to the table, and it would be to their advantage to      find ways we both can use [them]."      In a more blatant revelation of U.S. sentiment, Gen. Howell
     Estes, commander of the U.S. Space Command, said the
     United States "is the only nation intellectually prepared for and
     morally capable" of controlling space-based intelligence.      President, Senators Set to clash on Encryption
     Bent on retaining access to any and all data exported from the
     United States, the Clinton administration soon will solidify its
     position on Internet security issues and have a bill sponsored
     in the Senate.      Meanwhile, microprocessing giant Intel Corp. of Santa Clara,
     Calif., which has been developing hardware-based encryption
     tools based on Cupertino, Calif.-based Hewlett-Packard's
     International Cryptography Framework, is sitting tight,
     waiting to see how things play out on Capitol Hill.      Intel already has submitted the framework for government
     review, but is closely guarding specifics about its encryption
     key lengths.      SET 2.0 on the way - Encryption spec speeds e-commerce      "SET 2.0 will be security-algorithm-independent," said Steve
     Mott, senior vice president for electronic commerce at
     MasterCard International. "The issue is not the underlying
     cryptography, and the problem is not with RSA's
     mathematics; it's how efficient [RSA's cryptography] is."      Vendors such as Certicom, Apple Computer, and RPK are all
     positioning themselves as alternatives to market-leader RSA
     for providing encryption technologies.      "We have SET 1.0 pilots going with elliptic curve
     cryptography," Mott said.      Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC) is a technology that is
     being pushed by both Certicom and Apple.
     RPK, meanwhile, offers another alternative to encryption: Its
     Mixture Generator encryption engine performs both bulk and
     key encryption.
     A Smart Partnership      Pretty Good Privacy Inc. and Schlumberger Electronic      Transactions are teaming up to integrate their encryption      and smart-card technologies. The two companies will interweave      PGP's encryption software with Schlumberger's Cryptoflex smart
     card, which supports functions such as key and digital
     certificate storage and signatures.
     U.S. Seeks Laissez Faire on Internet      The Clinton administration plans to tell the Internal Revenue
     Service and bank regulators to forget about new rules for
     Internet commerce in a policy paper that is scheduled to be
     released later this spring, Ira Magaziner said last week.      It is unclear how far this laissez faire approach will go.
     Speaking at the same session, a top official in the Office of
     the U.S. Trade Representative warned about the obstacles he
     sees in trying to get other governments to go along.      He warned. "What do governments want to do? They want to
     regulate," he added. "It's ingrained to the system. It's almost a
     social-democratic ideal they want to fulfill."      MITI to develop int'l electronic commerce technology      The ministry will formulate a standard for authentication
     centers that use different data-verification methods. The new
     protocol would facilitate the exchange of encryption data
     among authentication centers around the world, thus allowing
     a business to verify the identity of a client in another country.
     MITI, which has earmarked over 10 billion yen (about 79.82
     million dollars) for electronic commerce tests, is hoping to
     nurture Japan's own electronic commerce services and to
     narrow the technological gap with the U.S.

FT reports on a new Deloitte & Touche report, "Fraud Without Frontiers" on the EU "fraud paradise." It sees 10 areas of concern:
  "Computer abuse, banking frauds, counterfeiting,
  investment fraud, confidence tricks, public sector
  fraud, fraudulent bankruptcy, insurance fraud,
  smuggling and money laundering.
  The largest single threat comes from fraud through the
  Internet. The potential for abuse of computer systems
  is huge, particuarly since encryption technology is
  vulnerable to sophisticated computer users. The Internet
  is now being used to manipulate financial markets.
  Fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated. Inside dealers
  are making more use of offshore havens to avoid detection
  while criminal syndicates with knowlege of banking
  practice have cheated banks.
  'Offshore havens', some inside the EU, remains a common

Prof. Dorothy E. Denning
This course will study the nature of information warfare, including computer crime and information terrorism, in the global information infrastructure as it relates to national security, defense policy, economic security, organizational security, and personal security. Students will gain an understanding of the threats and vulnerabilities, including military and economic espionage, denial of service, destruction and modification of data, distortion and fabrication of information, forgery, control and disruption of information flow, electronic bombs, and psyops and perception management. They will learn about attacks and countermeasures, including authentication, encryption, auditing, monitoring, and firewalls, and the limitations of those countermeasures. They will learn about cyberspace law enforcement and investigations, information warfare and the military, and intelligence in the information age. Information technology policy and ethics will be examined.
This is not to single out the duality of Professor Denning/Mr. Denning. There are several similar dual-use courses being taught at civ-mi schools as market-wise institutions-governments

   EU fraudsters 'revel in fiscal paradise'
      Report urges Brussels authorities to crack down on $77bn
      cross-border corruption
   By John Mason in Brussels
   International fraud in the European Union could be costing
   governments, companies and individuals up to $77bn a year,
   a report commissioned by the European Commission has
   concluded.
   Crimes such as Internet abuse, counterfeiting, banking and
   investment frauds and smuggling pose an increasing threat
   which can only be countered by further international
   action, said Deloitte & Touche, the accountancy firm.
   Harmonisation of laws and regulations, improved
   co-operation between states and a greater stress on fraud
   prevention are needed if EU economies are not to be
   undermined by international criminals, the report said.
   Mr Will Inglis, the Deliotte & Touche partner responsible
   for the report, said: "There is clear evidence that
   determined fraudsters deliberately and cynical]y manipulate
   and take advantage of the different regulatory and
   monitoring regimes across the EU to perpetrate their
   frauds. In particular, we see the fraudsters taking
   advantage of havens of secrecy and fiscal paradises.
   Fraudulent activity in the Union has the potential to
   seriously distort competition and harm the citizens of the
   EU who end up paying the cost."
   The report identified 10 areas of concern: computer abuse,
   banking frauds, counterfeiting, investment fraud,
   confidence tricks, public sector fraud, fraudulent
   bankruptcy, insurance fraud, smuggling and money
   laundering.
   The type of crime varies considerably between countries. In
   the UK, financial services fraud is a problem because of
   the size of the industry, France suffers particularly from
   counterfeiting of luxury goods, while in Greece the
   smuggling of antiquities is second only to the drugs trade
   in terms of crime.
   However, across the EU, the removal of restrictions
   following the creation of the single market and
   technological advances have opened up opportunities for
   fraudsters, the report said.
   Perhaps the largest single threat comes from fraud through
   the Internet, Mr Inglis said. The potential for abuse of
   computer systems is huge, particularly since encryption
   technology is vulnerable to sophisticated computer abusers.
   The Internet is now also being used to manipulate financial
   markets.
   In other areas, fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated.
   Insider dealers are making more use of offshore havens to
   avoid detection while criminal syndicates with knowledge of
   banking practice have cheated banks.
   Not that frauds all need to be sophisticated. Italian
   investigators discovered that Libyan dinars were being
   taken to Naples to be literally "laundered" with a solvent
   and re-printed as D-Marks.
   The incidence of cross-border frauds is increasing faster
   than those which take place only within one country, with
   organised crime playing a substantial role, the report
   said. Other perpetrators of fraud, although on a lesser
   scale, include senior company managers.
   The report points to lack of legal harmonisation: In some
   EU states it is not even an offence to bribe somebody in a
   different country.
   Action against fraud can also damage a member state's
   economy. The use of "offshore" havens, some inside the EU,
   remains a common feature of fraud. But with some EU
   economies closely linked to the offshore world, the
   incentive to push for reform in this area is limited.
   Fraud, especially crossborder fraud, tends also to be given
   low priority compared to other crimes. There is also less
   political will to tackle money laundering when this
   involves fraud rather than drugs.
   The report concludes there are four priority areas -    increased legal harmonisation, improved co-operation
   between member states, a greater concentration on
   confiscating fraudsters' assets and developing awareness of
   fraud prevention.

@_subject: New USG Privacy Initiative 
The Administration has issued today for public comment a major new paper on privacy:
"Options for Promoting Privacy on the National Information Opening paragraphs:
This Options Paper explores the growing public concern about personal information privacy. The paper describes the status of electronic data protection and fair information practices in the United States today, beginning with a discussion of the Principles for providing and using personal information issued by the Information Infrastructure Task Force in 1995. It then provides an overview of new information technologies, which shows that personal information is currently collected, shared, aggregated, and disseminated at a rate and to a degree unthinkable just a few years ago. Government is no longer the sole possessor of extensive amounts of personal information about U.S. citizens; in recent years the acquisition of personal information by the private sector has increased dramatically.
We next consider in more detail the laws and policies affecting information privacy in four specific areas: government records, communications, medical records, and the consumer market. This examination reveals that information privacy policy in the United States consists of various laws, regulations and practices, woven together to produce privacy protection that varies from sector to sector. Sometimes the results make sense, and sometimes they do not. The degree of protection accorded to personal information may depend on the data delivery mechanism rather than on the type of information at issue. Moreover, information privacy protection efforts in the United States are generally reactive rather than proactive: both the public and the private sector adopt policies in response to celebrated incidents of nonconsensual disclosure involving readily discernable harm. Sometimes this approach leaves holes in the fabric of privacy protection.  We then turn to the core question: in the context of the GII, what is the best mechanism to implement fair information practices that balance the needs of government, commerce, and individuals, keeping in mind both our interest in the free flow of information and in the protection of information privacy? At one end of the spectrum there is support for an entirely market-based response. At the other end of the spectrum, we are encouraged to regulate fair information practices across all sectors of the economy. In between these poles lie a myriad of options. In response to public concern, both government and private industry seem to be taking a harder look at privacy issues. As government and consumers become more aware of the GII's data collection, analysis and distribution capabilities, demand could foster a robust, competitive market for privacy protection. This raises the intriguing possibility that privacy could emerge as a market commodity in the Information Age. We recognize ongoing efforts to enhance industry self regulation to carry out the IITF Privacy Principles. We also discuss ways this self regulation might be enforced, and discuss a number of ways that government could facilitate development of a privacy market. We then consider a number of options that involve creation of a federal privacy entity. We discuss some of the many forms that such an entity could take and consider the advantages and disadvantages of the various choices. We also consider the functions that such an entity might perform, as well as various options for locating a privacy entity within the federal government.  This paper presents a host of options for government and private sector action. Our ultimate goal is to identify the means to maintain an optimal balance between personal privacy and freedom of information in the digital environment. The next step is to receive and respond to public comment on the report in order to develop consensus regarding the appropriate allocation of public and private sector responsibility for implementation of fair information practices.

While it might be too touchy for Netscaper cryptographers to address

There may be more to this story than appears in the PR of
industry and government. The crypto fight may be a diversion.
Suppose the governments intend to relax crypto restrictions once other technologies to monitor electronic transactions are
in place and and enforcers have been trained to snare illegal transactors based on physical evidence of crime beyond the
digital. Recall that that's what Peter Neumann and others on the NRC crypto panel suggested as an agenda for the FBI to forego undue
crypto emphasis.
Is it not possible that the US and other nations will allow strong
encryption so long as other means are at hand to control any
action merely cloaked in encrypted language, as has been done
forever with stylistic literature and speech?

   I.B.M. Researchers Develop A New Encryption Formula
   By Laurence Zuckerman
   I.B.M. plans to announce today that two of its researchers
   have come up with a new computer encryption formula that
   they say is nearly impossible to crack.
   The International Business Machines Corporation said that
   the breakthrough was still a long way from being employed
   outside the lab and that it did nothing to resolve the
   running dispute between the computer industry and the
   Federal Government over whether law enforcement agencies
   should be given access to encrypted communications. But it
   could ultimately help reduce the vulnerability of so-called
   public-key encryption, which is the favored security method
   used to safeguard commerce and privacy on the Internet.
   "They've made a big advance," said Joan Feigenbaum, a
   researcher at AT&T Labs in Murray Hill, N.J., who is
   familiar with the work of the two computer scientists who
   developed the system, Miklos Ajtai and Cynthia Dwork of
   I.B.M.'s Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif.
   "Scientifically, this is a big step in the right
   direction."
   But Bruce Schneier, a computer security consultant in
   Minneapolis and author of a standard textbook on
   cryptography, dismissed the news.
   "Theoretically it is important, but as a security
   breakthrough there is nothing new," he said.
   In public-key encryption, the sender of an electronic
   communication uses software that automatically scrambles
   the information by incorporating a publicly known numerical
   key. Decoding the scrambled transmission requires a private
   key, a number supposedly known only by the recipient.
   The security of the system depends, among other things, on
   how difficult it is for an electronic eavesdropper to crack
   the code using a powerful computer. If some of the codes
   that are generated by the system are difficult to break but
   others are easy, the system is inherently weak. I.B.M. said
   that its new system was the first to generate hundreds of
   codes at random, each of which is as difficult to crack as
   the hardest instance of the underlying mathematical
   problem.
   The system is based on a problem that has defied solution
   by mathematicians for 150 years, I.B.M. said.
   Mr. Schneier said that the cryptographic formulas now in
   use were already robust enough. The biggest challenge, he
   said, is creating security systems in the real world that
   are not vulnerable to hackers.
   "Cryptography is a lot more than math" he said.

"This is not to imply that any humans at all are necessarily

a conclusion. Rather, we believe the study reported here
indicates a need for further research. Tumorigenesis in
genetically predisposed mice may provide a useful assay
for interactions between RF fields and biological systems. With the current rapid expansion in the use of RF fields
for telecommunications, a reliable assay is required to
enable a better assessment of limits to safe levels of
human exposure."

It is not McVeigh's type of ANFO-munitions that threaten

munitions available to wage war on public policy, commerce, legislation, funding, regulation, intelligence, surveillance and law enforcement.
There has been an astonishing range of such munitions discussed on cypherpunks in the three years I've been around, and there's much more in the archives (handily collated in Tim's Crypto is central, to be sure, but hardly the only munition, as
many often remind.
Indeed, it is noteworthy how many of the broad range of these
potentially destructive munitions are not regulated by the EAR
and other regimes.
As with chemicals, explosives, bio-organisms, mathematics, physics,
it takes highly skilled people to advise the regulators on what
needs control and when, and not just the finished weapon, but its
components and sub-components. (As an example, see ATF's latest list of explosives:  )
The war underway is often waged at secret councils of scientific
information and intelligence used by all government and
military agencies (meetings are listed in the Federal Register,
regularly reported on jya.com).
So it is not the known terrorist-munitions that are worrisome; it's
the ones not yet publicized but known to scientists, warfighters and
keepers of secrets who keep their fingers crossed and plan for
the worst -- say, the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure
Protection ( ).
It would be instructive to post here uncontrolled munitions available for the war underway, with comments on how to elude control of the burgeoning domestic and global regimes.

The Oregonian, May 20, 1997, Metro Section P-1:
   IRS says suspect discussed sabotage
      An affidavit says a Vancouver man arrested Friday talked of
      sabotaging Portland's 9-1-1 computer and Bull Run water
   By John Painter, Jr., of the Oregonian staff
   Vancouver, Wash. -- A Vancouver man arrested Friday by Internal
   Revenue agents discussed sabotaging the computers in Portland's
   9-1-1 center and talked about using a botulism toxin to contaminate    the Bull Run water supply, a federal agent said Monday.
   James Dalton Bell, 38, appeared Monday afternoon in U.S. District
   Court in Tacoma and was accused in an 18-page affidavit of scheming
   to overthrow the U.S. government.
   U.S. Magistrate J. Kelly Arnold set Friday for a detention and
   preliminary hearing. The government has asked that Bell be held
   without bail because he is a danger to the community.
   Bell, who describes himself as a libertarian, has a history of tax
   disputes with the IRS, which says Bell "has a large, outstanding unpaid
   balance."
   Bell is the author of "Assassination Politics," a 10-part essay about a
   risk-free way of rewarding assassins who successfully kill designated
   public officials. The essay has circulated on the Internet.
   The strategy, which Bell says he wrote and posted for discussion,
   involves uses of encryption to predict and confirm assassinations and
   electronic digital cash to pay for the killings.
   Federal agents raided Bell's Vancouver home April 1.
   He is accused of obstructing government officers and employees and
   using false Social Security numbers. But government agents think he
   is far more dangerous than the charges suggest, the affidavit filed by
   IRS Inspector Phillip G. Scott said.
   Scott's affidavit said Bell, who has a chemistry degree from the
   Massaschusetts Institute of Technology, had discussions about using
   carbon fiber particles to attack computer systems with Greg Daly, a
   friend who is an electronics specialist overseeing Portland's 9-1-1
   communications center.
   "Daly stated that he and Bell had 'laughed' about attacking the 9-1-1
   center with fiber," the affidavit said.
   Daly also told IRS agents that he had hypothetical discussions with
   Bell about contaminating water supplies and about making botulism
   toxin from green beans, the affidavit said.
   In the April 17 and 18 interviews with IRS agents, Daly said that as part
   of his job, he "has keys and direct access to the Portland Bull Run
   water treatment facility."
   Daly said Monday that the conversations that he and Bell had were
   merely "intellectual fun-and-games discussions" between old friends
   who enjoy technical things.
   "There's a difference between reasonable freedom of speech and
   unreasonable probability of attack," Daly said. "Standing around and
   flapping our lips about how it would be funny is way different from
   even contemplating actual attack."
   Daly described his friend of 15 years as a "bit of an odd unit" but never
   dangerous and never serious about attacking the 9-1-1 systems or the
   Bull Run watershed.
   "I'd rat him out in a heartbeat for that," Daly said.
   Thursday, IRS agents searched the home of Robert East, a merchant
   radioman and a friend of Bell's. Among items seized was 3-foot length
   of carbon fiber.
   The affidavit said East told agents that he and Bell had discussed "the
   possibility of putting the fibers down the air vents of a federal building"
   to kill its computers and about using the fiber against the IRS.
   However, Bell has described himself as a "man of ideas, not action,"
   and East said Bell was a "talker, not a doer."

New Cryptanalysis Course Announced by NTI One Day
Course for Corporate, Military and Law Enforcement Computer
Specialists Covers Issues in Cryptography and Cryptanalysis
Gresham, Ore., May 20 -- NTI today announced a one day class which gives corporate, military and law enforcement MIS personnel a
state-of-the-art grounding on the topics of computer
cryptography and cryptanalysis. With materials developed by
Eric Thompson, one of the world leading experts in this field,
attendees will receive instruction in the technological and
procedural elements of cryptanalysis. Unlike other sources of
information on the topic, this presentation covers the analysis
of existing commercial applications and their weaknesses. This course joins NTI's other courses in forensic computer
science. The forensic courses covers state-of-the-art
information regarding computer evidence processing,
evidence preservation and the identification of relevant data. "This class in cryptography grew out of requests for more
information on encryption from our forensics course
attendees. The course is highly focused and is presented with
state-of-the-art materials," stated Michael R. Anderson, the
President and co-founder of NTI, "and it covers material that
has historically not been presented from a practical
perspective. Computer and data security are rapidly becoming
a top priority as organizations become increasingly aware of
their vulnerability to information attack and encryption is a
vital part of reducing that vulnerability." Topics covered in the NTI cryptography course include:   Cryptographic terms and lexicon   Basics of crypto system design   Isolating cryptographic weakness in commercial systems   Cryptography in electronic commerce   Cryptography in Internet security applications   International issues in cryptography and secure applications   The Future of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis "Eric Thompson, our senior cryptographer, developed the
materials used in the presentation of this unique course,"
continued Anderson. "Eric is a world class cryptographer,
highly respected in both commercial and government
cryptography circles. In this class he brings to the topic at
hand real world, practical experience that has helped a
majority of government agencies deal with encryption issues."
Courses are regularly scheduled for presentation at the NTI
headquarters in Gresham, Oregon, and at conference facilities
throughout the United States; custom courses can also be
scheduled for presentation at corporate or government sites.
Attendance is $995 per person and includes all course
materials, luncheon and a certificate of completion. NTI (New Technologies, Inc.) is a world leading developer
of software utilities, procedures and training for computer
forensics and enterprise system security. Founded in 1996 by
a group of internationally recognized experts on computer
forensics and security issues, the company is privately held
with headquarters in Gresham, Oregon and field offices in
Eugene, Oregon; Provo, Utah, and Atlanta, Georgia. Visit NTI's Internet web site at  SOURCE New Technologies Inc. 503-674-9145, or E-mail: info New Technologies, Inc. 2075 Northeast Division Gresham, Oregon 97030 USA

Forensic and Encryption Training
3 Day Oregon Training Schedule: May 20-22, June 24-26, July 22-24, Aug 19-21, Sept 16-18, Oct 21-23
Law enforcement and military agencies have been involved in processing computer evidence for years. The founders of NTI were instrumental in the creation of the training courses in the field of Forensic Computer Science that have become the international standard for evidence processing world wide. They developed the first computer evidence courses at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and created the original training courses and certification for the International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists. These founders have also been
instrumental in developing password recovery software which deals with the breaking of security associated with a majority of the commercial word processing, spread sheet and database software applications. In addition, a majority of the computer evidence processing tools used by law enforcement and military agencies were developed by the founders or employees of NTI.
With the creation of NTI, corporations and government agencies now have access to forensic information and tools which can be used in the identification of computer security risks and in
internal investigations. NTI will also continue to support law enforcement and military agencies by making state-of-the art training and automated forensic tools available at discounted rates. For security reasons, our training courses and forensic software tools are only made available to law enforcement agencies, government agencies, large corporations and consultants who
work with large corporations and/or government agencies.
Applied Cryptography & Cryptanalysis
NTI has three full time cryptographers employed in its Utah offices. Our file encryption software is developed in that facility and Eric Thompson is our senior cryptographer. Eric's credentials are
mentioned elsewhere in our web site. However, it is safe to say that he is one of the top cryptographers in the world and has broken the security associated with most commercial applications that feature encryption or password protection. We rely upon Eric and his team to
teach these courses at the sites of sponsoring government agencies and corporations.

Forensic Tools
The FILTER Forensic Tool:
This program is used to remove binary (non alpha-numeric) characters from computer data. This program has been used internationally by military and law enforcement agencies for years and was donated to the law enforcement community by one of our founders back in 1991. Once a file has been processed with this program the content can be printed and viewed with more traditional types of programs, e.g. word processors. This program should not be confused with NTI's intelligent filter program. ...
The NTIDOC Forensic Tool:
This program is used to essentially take an electronic snap shot of files and subdirectories that have previously been identified to have some evidentiary value. It is a documentation tool. The program automatically creates documentation that can easily be printed, viewed or merged into forensic reports. The original program entitled DOC has been used for years by military and law enforcement computer specialists and has previously been donated for that use by the founders of NTI. ...
The SPACES Security Review Tool:
This program is very simple. It creates one or more files that contain nothing but spaces. To be exact, every file created by this program will contain 10,000 spaces. Such output is ideal in the evaluation of encryption patterns to determine security weakness. Our forensic training courses and cryptography courses cover this concept in detail. MICRO-ID Computer Theft Prevention Software:
This software is used to mark computer hard disk drives with computer ownership information. Once a computer has been marked it can be identified by police should it be recovered as stolen property. The program that reads the ownership information is called COP-ONLY and as the name implies the program is only distributed to local, county and state law enforcement agencies. ...

Ray Arachelian taped the Cryptography Forum at the
Association of the Bar of the City of New York
last evening and will share once its transcribed.
In the meantime:
TITLE OF PROGRAM:
Guns, Ammunition and Cryptography: Is the Government's
Policy on Digital Encryption Creating a Crisis?
Charles R. Nesson, Professor, Harvard Law School
Matt Blaze, Co-author of Risks of Key Recovery paper.
(short-notice invitee)
Lynn McNulty (ex-NIST now RSA) filling in for Jim Bidzos
Scott Charney, Computer Crime Unit, Department of Justice
Kenneth W. Dam, Professor, University of Chicago Law School
Dorothy E. Denning
David J. Farber, University of Pennsylvania
Marc Rotenberg, EPIC
Nesson asked the audience (about a hundred), "How many use encryption?" Over half raised hands. "Wow!" he said, "If I asked that of a law class at Harvard, maybe two or three hands would have been raised."
Nesson then posed to the principal question: "Is the government's
policy on cryptography creating a crisis?"
Dam, Denning and Charney said no. Other panelists said yes.
The audience by show of hands was about evenly split.
There was intense discussion among the panelists but no change in position.
Some highlights:
David Kahn, in the audience, reaffirmed his support for
key escrow, stating that it would not change the current
legal provisions for electronically snooping, and why ask for more privacy than is now authorized.
Blaze summarized the KR risks paper and pointed out the
enormous expense of designing, implementing, operating
and securing a global key recovery system -- which, as he
ironically smiled, could make cryptographers and crypto-corps rich. That such a system might make security weaker by offering fewer choice targets to attack -- the key repositories.
Blaze reminded that encryption will become pervasive in
all electronic systems, not just communications. That it must
be robust and untamperable or more and more crucial systems will be vulnerable to attack. And, the more complicated the
security provisions the more likely they will fail.
Farber stated that time was being wasted on KR debate while
the nation's infrastructure remained immensely vulnerable to
electronic attack. He said that with six students he could shut
the system down in "a few days, with, say, spoof E-mail to key
administrators." That ITEF is working on a next-generation
system to prevent that, but meanwhile there is great risk.
McNulty reaffirmed industry's position that other countries will
develop robust encryption if the US does not allow export.
Charney responded by pointing out that the administration seeks global commitment to key escrow among governments, and asserts they will comply for the same reasons the USG wants it. He said, for example, that countries may allow development of strong crypto but, like the US, will not allow export. He cited Japan's refusal to allow NTT's 128-bit export, and said Russia will surely
not allow the export of the Sun/Elvis product. Same for France, Germany, and so forth.
There was audience derision when Charney noted that the US must
do as the Russians and Chinese and French do to control crypto.
Interestingly, Charney did not cite The Wassenaar Arrangement, although Dam pointed out how difficult it was to reach agreement on the COCOM predecessor and enforce compliance with it.
Nesson summarized Charney's position by saying, "do you mean
that key escrow would do no more than help you catch criminals
too stupid to use unescrowed crypto?" Charney nodded, and said
that "nearly all all criminals we catch by electronic surveillance
talk openly about being surveilled but do nothing about to
avoid it."
Nesson reiterated: "Do you mean that you want a system to catch
stupid criminals while the nation's infrastructure is left
vulnerable?" Charney, "That's not the right way to put it."
Denning gave examples of her recent survey of law enforcement
for examples of crypto use to hinder investigations.
Finally, Dam noted that encryption policy was a different task
than implementing encryption systems. That the detailed understanding
of those who follow the encryption debate is not shared by the
public nor by most officials. That agreement upon policy will
require greater education for those who could not care less about
the complications and subtleties being debated.
An auditor queried: There seems to be agreement that encryption will work best when it is totally transparent to users, and the sooner that is devised the better. Why not just get on with it,?
Blaze shook his head at this cluelessness, howled at the ceiling,
sprouted fur, bared teeth, leaped Dave Farber, went for Charney's
jugular, clawed Denning. Kahn and the suited audience ran screaming into the safe streets of Manhattan, while shaggy coders roared,
"Kill, kill, kill the infrastructure-fuckers."

A supplement to the NYC Crypto Forum:
Toward the end Nesson asked, "How about the missing
participant here, NSA?"
Several panelists noted, "NSA's here, in the audience."
(Nonesuch spoke, however.)
Nesson went on to ask, "What about national security
interests outweighing the right to privacy?"
It was here that David Kahn offered his defense of key
Farber and others responded that the problem is that
the government is not trusted, that guards against
abuse of power have not worked, that national security
too often has been a cloak for illicit actions.
Here, an audience member said that he worked at Salomon
Brothers doing traffic analysis of vast E-mail, and that we
should be aware that more electronic snooping is going on than most people know. How could we be sure that law
enforcement would not similarly abuse systems set up to
catch criminals for other purposes, as NSA allegedly does, and, now using the same methodolgies, as private companies do to spy on employees, customers and competitors.
All panelists nodded at this, that it's hard to tell god from
the devil, and crypto won't help.

True, if that's what the friends actually said, and if they were

go down with Bell, protect yourself, spill your guts.
Recall that John Painter spoke to one or more of them
and they hedged the remarks of the complaint, but he,
too, saw the makings of a deal in the affadavit's allegations.
Turning friends against friends is pretty common in
investigations, using threats and promises of relief
from possible charges, even saying that your friend is
squealing on you.
I was struck by how similar some remarks attributed to
Bell were to those attributed to McVeigh, not that they
were not made, but that the investigators chose to
select just those to indicate lethal intent. The possible link between the McVeigh trial and Jim Bell's bust could indicate how the feds are itching to attack
every advocate of anti-gov mayhem (no pun Tim).
The IRS searching the Internet for incriminating advocacy is a warning of what's to come, as often predicted here.
Time to study and ponder the 1st Amend -- which, by the way,
Matt Blaze did at the NYC crypto forum last night to challenge

@_subject: Crypto Disputes 
For full versions of the stories below:
        For two years, the IETF Security Group has labored to
     hammer out the IP Security (IPSec) protocol, a standard way
     that businesses can open up an encrypted link to a trading
     partner's network. The link is encrypted after authentication
     by means of an X.509 digital certificate at an IPSec-based
     firewall or gateway.      But an unresolved, bitter dispute over the technique for
     automatically swapping keys over the 'Net - referred to as
     key management - has resulted in two incompatible schemes
     in the IPSec specification.
     In this battle of the acronyms, the debate centers on the
     Simple Key Management for IP (SKIP), developed by Sun
     Microsystems, Inc., and the Internet Secure Association Key
     Management Protocol (ISAKMP), developed by the National
     Security Agency.      Responding to Sun's announcement that it would license
     128-bit encryption algorithms from Elvis+Co., a Russian
     company, the White House announced that it would look into      Sun's actions.      "Sun's strategy is another brick from a wall that is coming
     down," said Jim Bidzos, president and CEO of RSA Data
     Security. "And it highlights that something is wrong with the      U.S. policy."      Sun has approximately a 10 percent equity stake in Elvis+,
     whose product is based on Sun's publicly available protocol,
     Simple Key Management for IP (SKIP). The 10 percent
     interest is thought to be key to keeping other companies from
     licensing and reselling the same technology.      The government's resolve, however, may be breaking down.
     Just last week, Sybase Inc. won approval to export database
     and server products with 56-bit DES encryption, even though
     the Emeryville, Calif., company has no model for key
     recovery.      SKIP, which stands for Simple Key management for Internet
     Protocols, was submitted by Sun to the Internet Engineering
     Task Force as an Internet standard. Included in SKIP E+ are
     algorithms for 56-bit DES, two- and three-key triple DES,
     and 64- and 128-bit ciphers for encrypting network traffic
     and keys.      The security software was developed by Elvis+, a company
     of former Soviet space scientists with offices near Moscow.

     of a SET-based, end-to-end Internet commerce solution
     containing full strength encryption technology to be approved
     for international export.      VeriFone's vGATE, vPOS and vWALLET software employ
     the SET encryption protocol for transactions over the
     Internet, utilizing 1024 bit key size for public key encryption
     and digital signatures, and 64 bit DES for bulk encryption.
     This approval enables VeriFone to offer a higher level of

Published today with great fanfare, "The Bible Code"
describes the fruits of three Israeli mathematicians in
decrypting hidden messages in the Bible by textual
analysis algorithms. Blurbs claim that the work passed
peer review for publication in a math journal a few
years back, was confirmed by "a US Defense Department
code-breaker" and predicted the assassinations of
JFK, RFK, Sadat and Rabin.
The NYT reported on the fanfare a few days ago and
quoted some who claimed that the Israelis' claims were
examined and faulted when first published, that the book's bunkum, and that if enough analysis is done on any text, any message can be found -- holy writs being perdurable candidates.
Even so, are any here familiar with the Israelis' work?
Better, is this book the first of many to come to celebrate the

Fourteen Ways of Looking at a Blackshirt
Umberto Eco, New York Review of Books, excerpted with permission in the Utne Reader, Nov./Dec. 1995, no. 72, pps. 57-59
In spite of some fuzziness regarding the difference between various historical forms of fascism, I think it is possible to outline a list of features that are typical of what I wold like to call Ur-Fascism, or eternal Fascism. These features cannot be organized into a system; many of them contradict each other, and are also typical of other kinds of despotism or fanaticism. But it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it.
The first feature of Ur-Fascism is the *cult of tradition*. Traditionalism is of course much older than fascism. Not only was it typical of counterrevolutionary Catholic thought after the French revolution, but it was born in the late Hellenistic era, as a reaction to classical Greek rationalism. In the Mediterranean basin, people of different religions (most of the faiths indulgently accepted by the Roman pantheon) started dreaming of a reelation received at the dawn of human history. This reelation, according to the traditionalist mystique, had remained for a long time concealed under the veil of forgotten languages -- in Egyptian hieroglyphs, in the Celtic runes, in the scrolls of the little-known religions of Asia.
This new culture had to be *syncretistic*. Syncreticism is not only , as the dictionary says, "the combination of different forms of belief or practice"; such a combination must tolerate contradictions. Each of the original messages contains a sliver of wisdom, and although they seem to say different or incompatible things, they all are nevertheless alluding, allegorically, to the same primeval truth.
As a consequence, there can be no advancement of learning. Truth already has been spelled out once and for all, and we can only keep interpreting its obscure message.
If you browse in the shelves that, in American bookstores, are labeled New Age, you can find there even Saint Augustine, who, as far as I know, was not a fascist. But combining Saint Augustine and Stonehenge -- that is a symptom of Ur-Fascism.
Traditionalism implies the *rejection of modernism*. Both Fascist and Nazis worshiped technology, while traditionalist thinkers usually reject it as a negation of traditional spiritual values. However, even though Nazism was proud of its industrial achievements, its praise of modernism was only the surface of an ideology based upon blood and earth (*Blut und Boden*). The rejection of the modern world was disguised as a rebuttal of the capitalistic way of life. The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as *irrationalism*.
3. Irrationalism also depends on the cult of *action for action's sake*. Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation. Therefore culture is suspect insofar as it is identified with critical attitudes. Distrust of the intellectual world has always been a symptom of Ur_Fascism, from Hermann Goering's fondness for a phrase from a Hanns Johst play ("When I hear the word 'culture' I reach for my gun") to the frequent use of such expressions as "degenerate intellectuals," "eggheads," "effete snobs," and "universities are nests of reds."  The official Fascist intellectuals were mainly engaged in attacking modern culture and the liberal intelligensia for having betrayed traditional values.
4. The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge. for Ur-Fascism, *disagreement is treason*. Besides, disagreement is a sign of diversity. Ur-Fascism grows up and seeks consensus by exploiting and exacerbating the natural *fear of difference*. The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.
Ur-Fascism derives from individual or social frustration. that is why one of the most typical features of this historical fascism was the *appeal to a frustrated middle class*, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups. In our time, when the old "proletarians" are becoming petty bourgeois (and the lumpen are largely excluded from the political scene), the fascism of tomorrow will find its audience in this new majority.
7. To people who feel deprived of a clear social identity, Ur-Fascism says that their only privilege is the most common one, to be born in the same country. This is the origin of nationalism. Besides, the only ones who can provide an identity to the nation are its enemies. Thus at the root of the Ur_fascist psychology there is the *obsession with a plot*, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is to appeal to xenophobia. But the plot must come from he inside. Jews are usually the best target because they have the advantage of being at the same time inside and outside. In the United States, a prominent instance of the plot obsession is to be found in Pat Robertson's *The New World Order*, but, as we have recently seen, there are many others.
The followers must feel *humiliated by the ostentatious wealth and force of their enemies*. When I was a boy I was taught to think of Englishmen as the five-meal people. They ate more frequently than the poor but sober Italians. Jews are rich and help each other through a secret web of mutual assistance. However, the followers of Ur_Fascism must also be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak. Fascist governments are condemned to lose wars because they are constitutionally incapable of objectively evaluating the force of the enemy.
For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle. Thus *pacifism is trafficking with the enemy*. This is bad because *life is permanent warfare*. This, however, brings about an Armageddon complex. Since enemies have to be defeated, there must be a final battle, after which the movement will have control of the world. But such a "final solution" implies a further era of peace, a Golden Age, which contradicts the principle of permanent war. No fascist leader has ever succeeded in solving this predicament.
Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology, insofar as it is fundamentally aristocratic, and aristocratic and militaristic elitism cruelly implies *contempt for the weak*. Ur-Fascism can only advocate a popular elitism. Every citizen belongs to the best people of the world, the member of the party are the best among the citizens, every citizen can (or ought to) become a member of the party. But there cannot be patricians without plebeians. In fact, the Leader, knowing that his power was not delegated to him democratically but was conquered by force, also knows that his force is based upon the weakness of the masses; they are so weak as to need and deserve a In such a perspective *everybody is educated to become a hero*. In every mythology the hero is an exceptional being, but in Ur-Fascist ideology heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death. It is not by chance that a motto of the Spanish Falangist was *Viva la Muerte* ("Long Live Death!"). In nonfascist societies, the lay public is told that death is unpleasant but must be faced with dignity; believers are told that it is the painful way to reach a supernatural happiness. By contrast, the Ur-Fascist hero craves heroic death, advertised as the best reward for a heroic life. The Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.
Since both permanent war and heroism are difficult games to play, *the Ur-Fascist transfers his will to power to sexual matters*. This is the origin of machismo (which implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality). Since even sex is a difficult game to play, the Ur_Fascist hero tends to play with the weapons -- doing so becomes an ersatz phallic exercise.
Ur-Fascism is based upon a *selective populism*, a qualitative populism, one might say.  In a democracy, the citizens have individual rights, but the citizens in their entirety have a political impact only from a quantitative point of view -- one follows the decisions of the majority.  For Ur-Fascism, however, the individuals as individuals have no rights, and the People is conceived as a quality, a monolithic entity expressing the Common will. Since no large quantity of human beings can have a common will, the Leader pretends to be their interpreter. Having lost their power of delegation, citizens do not act; they are only called on to play the role of the People. Thus the People is only a theatrical fiction. there is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional responses of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the Because of its qualitative populism, Ur-Fascism must be *against "rotten" parliamentary governments*.  Wherever a politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of a parliament because it no longer represents the Voice of the People, we can smell Ur-Fascism.
*Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak*. Newspeak was invented by Orwell, in _1984_, as the official language of what he called Insoc, English Socialism. But elements of Ur-Fascism are common to different forms of dictatorship. All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning. But we must be ready to identify other kinds of Newspeak, even if they take the apparently innocent form of a popular talk show.
Ur-Fascism is still around us, sometimes in plainclothes. It would be so much easier for us if there appeared on the world scene somebody saying, "I want to reopen Auschwitz, I want the blackshirts to parade again in the Italian squares." Life is not that simple. Ur-Fascism can come back under the most innocent of disguises. Our duty is to uncover it and to point our finger at any of its new instances -- ever day, in every part of the world. Franklin Roosevelt's words on November 4, 1938, are worth recalling: "If American democracy ceases to move forward as a living force, seeking day and night by peaceful means to better the lot of our citizens, facism will grow in strength in our land." Freedom and liberation are an unending task.

QUESTION:  What is the State Department's reaction to the decision of
the German Interior Ministers to put the Church of Scientology under
nationwide observation by the anti-extremist watchdogs?
MR. BURNS:  Well, we understand that the German state and federal
interior ministers have agreed to pursue the recommendations of an
experts group which called for the collection of information on
Scientologists and scientology.  It is our understanding - and we have a
very incomplete understanding, actually, of this decision - that the
ministers directed state and federal law enforcement agencies to develop
a plan to implement these recommendations.
We will examine the details of this decision carefully, but since I
don't believe our embassy in Bonn or our German experts here at the
State Department have had sufficient time really to look at this in
detail, I don't think it's appropriate for me to give you a detailed
comment.  I will say this.  The United States obviously has to stand for
freedom of religion.  We have that in our own country and we stand for
freedom of religion around the world.  If you would just look at our
annual human rights reports, I think four out of the last five years or
five of the last six - I forget which - we have mentioned this issue of
But I feel compelled to say something else about this issue, and that is
that Germany needs to be protected, the German Government and the German
leadership need to be protected from this wild charge made by the Church
of Scientology in the United States that somehow the treatment of
Scientologists in Germany can or should be compared to the treatment of
Jews who had to live, and who ultimately perished, under Nazi rule in
the 1930s.
This wildly inaccurate comparison is most unfair to Chancellor Kohl and
to his government and to regional governments and city governments
throughout Germany.  It has been made consistently by supporters of
scientology here in the United States, and by Scientologists themselves.
I do want to disassociate the United States Government from this
campaign.  We reject this campaign.  It is most unfair to Germany and to
Germans in general.
QUESTION:  Anything in this latest effort by Germany to deal with the
Church of Scientology that concerns you?
MR. BURNS:  Well, Carol, as I said, we have a sketchy understanding, at
best, of what this means.  It appears to be instructions by state and
federal law enforcement agencies to look at a set of recommendations and
develop a plan upon recommendations.
We have an alliance relationship with Germany.  We have a very close
relationship. I think among friends, you don't shoot first and ask
questions later.  What we need to do is study this issue, talk to the
German Government about it, and then perhaps we will have something to
say later on.  But I think it would be most unfair to Germany for us to
have detailed comments when we don't have a detailed understanding of
what this process may or may not be.  Yes.

sender's hard drive or at a ``good-guy'' recipient such as a
bank). We suspect that law enforcement and national security
experts within the government are acquiring similar
capabilities. But these alternative (and more subtle)
approaches are not reflected in the Administration's current
public policy toward encryption.
    The Administration's current encryption policy, a policy
that runs back at least to the Bush Administration, creates
more problems than it resolves. The policy is a combination of
encryption export controls and a key escrow system by which the
key to the code encrypting the information is to be held by a
third party (so it may be made available to the government).
    We need to be honest about this situation. We don't expect
most narcotics traffickers, terrorists, or criminals to respect
export restrictions on encryption when they don't respect our
underlying drugs or weapons laws. And we don't generally expect
anyone who employs encryption in furtherance of a crime to
readily give their keys to some third party so they may be made
available to the government.
    The Administration maintains that there is a commercial
need for key recovery. While that may be true to some extent,
there appears to be little or no demand for the all-
encompassing system they want to mandate. Experts have
uniformly concluded the government's proposed system is either
excessively costly and complex or insecure. In part, this is
true because the government seeks access to real-time
communications and data transmissions, rather than the ability
to recover stored data.
    The Administration insists it doesn't want domestic
restrictions on encryption. We are concerned, however, that the
Administration policy does have this effect. Development of
software programs, including those utilizing encryption, occurs
at an amazingly rapid pace, so it is not feasible for computer
software and hardware companies to develop separate products
for export and for domestic use. As a result, as a practical
matter, only products that are exportable, with weaker
encryption or with government-approved key recovery-escrow, can
be marketed at present.
    We fear that current encryption policy, encouraging as it
does weaker encryption, makes every American more vulnerable to
illicit or surreptitious access to our computer files, our
phone conversations, and personal information, and thus exposes
our citizens to hackers, terrorists, and thieves. It is ironic
that what is trumpeted as an aid to law enforcement may
instead compromise individual and corporate security.
    What we have here is not only a combination of export
controls and a key recovery system that does not work, we have
a system that compromises the competitiveness and security of
this nation's software and hardware industry, as well as our
privacy rights. As conceded by Administration witnesses, the
proposed key recovery system can succeed only as long as there
is no non-conforming encryption software readily available in
the market. But there is already an abundance of such software,
some of it freeware, that is readily available over the
    The proposed key recovery system can not work unless the
United States persuades every other nation to adopt key
recovery. We can safely say we are unlikely to obtain the
agreement of Libya, Iran, Iraq, or North Korea. In addition,
the efforts to date of David Aaron, U.S. Ambassador to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
to obtain a consensus in support of key recovery resulted
instead in a consensus opposing it.
    The Administration's policy has therefore been a strong
market incentive:
          (a) for non-participants (in the Administration's key
        escrow program) to make non-standard, secure encryption
        available, and
          (b) for U.S. companies to set up abroad in
        "encryption havens'' so they may legally market
        strong, secure encryption products to customers who
        decline to make their "international key'' available
        to diverse governments around the world.
There are already U.S. companies establishing ties with foreign
companies in Japan, Russia, and elsewhere.
    Nor is this policy without its cost. It is estimated that,
if the U.S. persists in its current policy through the year
2000, we shall lose 200,000 jobs and $60 billion each year.
This is what it will cost this nation to lose the cryptography
lead we enjoy and the competitive expertise necessary to
maintain our market position.
    Unfortunately, our discussions to date with law enforcement
and intelligence agencies have not admitted of the possibility
of any further relaxation of export restrictions as part of the
broader process essential to resolving this complex question.
Nor has the Administration offered to consider alternatives to
its key escrow or key recovery system.
    H.R. 695 need not be the end of the process but the
beginning of a real dialogue. This is what we would like to
happen. We continue to remain hopeful that the Administration
will acknowledge the shortcomings of its current policy and
sincerely hope that this will happen soon lest more serious
damage be done to our industry, to our security and to our

     Unleashing Microbots on Iran's IT Networks
     Unlike the 1990-1991 Gulf War, when the USA inserted a      National Security Agency-developed, virus-laden microchip      into a French computer printer headed for Baghdad, in 2015      the USA relies on several methods for infecting Iranian
     computers. These efforts hope to get around problems
     created by the proliferation of encryption technology.      While some peripheral equipment, like printers, will be
     intercepted and bugged in order to disable mainframe
     computers, intelligence technicians will also use the internet
     to send guided viruses into Iran's national information
     infrastructure.      Thumbnail-sized micro-robots, known as `microbots', will
     also be unleashed by micro-air vehicles and naval guns. These
     parasites will creep into electronic equipment, attach
     themselves, and keep themselves alive by draining generator
     power.      Once the electronics system's energy is depleted, the fully
     charged microscopic vermin will search for a new victim.      The main problem will be that they are too small to carry
     identification equipment and so they infect indiscriminately.
     As such, they must be deployed far away from allied
     equipment.      However, packages of microbots can be destroyed remotely
     as allies prepare to invade enemy territory.      <>      [Copyright 1997, Jane's Information Group]

This iconic treatment of a national hero is worth pondering

The imposition of protective measures often occurs through
those with impeccable credentials, especially by appealing to the ones who believe that their special role is to rise above ordinary struggles and dispense exceptional wisdom, fairness and
The question on McCain is: has he been sold on the threat to national security of cryptography by appealing to his deep patriotism, his belief in a special duty to protect the nation, to fight its "war" with the day's enemies.

Richlieus running the government, raiding the till, commanding the academies, distributing authorizations to placate antsy The cariacature of this are "banana republics" where
military and political saviors justify coups in the name

He claimed to be just a paranoid hacker who didn't want to      stick around once his probation was up. As it turns out, he      may have been telling me the truth. In a federal court in Los      Angeles, the government admitted it had made a mistake in saying      that Mitnick was on the lam.      The admission may put an entirely different twist on the case.
     If Mitnick wasn't really a fugitive, a couple of probation
     violations mistakenly escalated into one the biggest manhunts
     in cyberspace. Petty offenses by Mitnick -- probably
     punishable by an extension of his probation -- spun into a

     A Canadian company claims it has a unique product that can      spur acceptance of biometric encryption.      The Touchstone device, from Mytec Technologies Inc. of
     Toronto, includes a patented technology called Bioscrypt-a
     coded key or personal identification number that can be
     decoded only when the user's finger slides across a scanner.      Mytec says it adds a layer of security to the fingerprint
     scanning methods typical at other vendors.      "What we do is slide a finger across a scanner, which takes
     the information in the finger pattern and allows it to
     descramble the encrypted key," said George Tomko,
     chairman and co-founder of Mytec.      The finger itself becomes essentially an encryption key and
     can be used in place of a personal identification number at a
     keyboard, automated teller machine, telephone, or to scramble
     data over the Internet.      "With this kind of technology, everyone's finger is a potential
     encryption key," said Mr. Tomko.      NetDox, Inc. today announced that the U.S. Department of
     Commerce has granted export approval for NetDox

Senators Lott, Burns and Ashcroft discussed encryption
policy reform on June 27. The Deschall crack is cited as
a risk posed by Admin-McCain-Kerrey limitations. Ashcroft    I am privileged to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee    where we will address this issue after the July recess. I    pledge to work with members on that Committee and with    other interested Senators and the leader to try to move a    bill in that committee that will capture the essence of Burns    substitute.
   No nationwide key recovery system, or a new licensing    requirement for certificate authorities should be brought    to the floor without thorough examination, analysis and    understanding. We must further study the impact of these    provisions well before this bill is brought to the Senate floor. For full report:

Phiber's employer refused to name the computer corp that installed the

However, experts interviewed said the password snarf feature is, ahem, well-known to experts, and that the only security worth trusting is the one you build and run yourself and test frequently and still makes you lay awake at night shivering in doubt fear and uncertainty -- like guilty-parental senators, TLA directors, and all the world's bearers of the public trust and such fundy druggies.

Four of the IRS messages on Jim Bell came here (see below), two via cypherpunks and two directly. (Oddly, none were forwarded

There are four messsage IDs, one of which matches that of Alan Olsen

Perhaps others could check their message IDs, inquire around listdom in order to assemble a list of targeted lists. Then a stink might be
made for the spam, get that Denver judge to hit "IRS Inspection" for another $250,000 to pay recipients for IRS's lack of proper public humility, if not for Jim's undue imprisonment, isolation by federal defender, coercion of witnesses, distortion of literature, and railroading Jim Bell to warn outlaws to not fuck with Sam's Gang and Roy Bean.
Note: Jim's Roy Bean docket shows that USA v. Bell was assigned to
Judge Franklin D. Burgess on July 9, with new case number 97-CR-5270. The US Attorney filed "Felony Information" on that date. That's the final entry, no listing for the alleged plea bargain.

anti-social acts in response to failure to meet obligations to the citizenry. Not a few think OKC bombing is the the way to fight government-sponsored terrorism against civilians.

and more sharing of "dual-use" weaponry with jittery, trigger-

Sez all the industry holdouts on GAK will come around when they see the Big Corps caving. Reinsch asserted that Microsoft is power behind Goodlatte's bill.

The New York Times, July 27, 1997, Money & Business, p. 12.
   Viewpoint
   Building an Internet Free of Barriers
   Vinton G. Cerf
      Vinton G. Cerf is senior vice president for Internet
      architecture and engineering at MCI Communications. He
      is a co-inventor of the computer networking protocol
      TCP/IP, which has become the language for Internet
      communications.
   When the subject is global networks like the Internet, the
   magic word is "seamlessness." Seamless global
   communications represents the technological promised land
   of major network providers like mine. For the consumer,
   seamlessness means unimpeded, smooth, clear communications
   among all points within a network and among all networks.
   To the extent that it has developed, seamlessness has been
   the sine qua non, the essential element, behind the
   fast-growing Internet. It is the essence of the links of
   the World Wide Web. The Internet, after all, is not a
   network, or even a medium, in the traditional sense, but a
   network of nearly 200,000 networks and a medium of media,
   encompassing all the long-established ones while creating
   entirely new types. The more seamless we make the Internet
   and, for that matter, the global information
   infrastructure, the quicker we will harness the immense
   potential.
   Although high hurdles of technology and infrastructure
   stare us in the face, obstacles of the political and public
   policy variety are equally daunting. Many policy makers
   fail to grasp that the very seamlessness already found on
   the Internet, coupled with its basic digital nature, makes
   it almost impossible to monitor or regulate its flow of
   information in a hierarchical way. Notwithstanding the
   efforts of certain countries, Big Brother would have real
   problems doing his dirty work on the Internet. Still,
   well-meaning policy makers try to extend longstanding
   social goals to the Internet through heavy-handed,
   market-distorting mandates when industry-led strategies
   could be more effective.
   Of greatest concern to the Internet industry today are the
   many legal quagmires and incoherent policy patchworks that
   hinder Internet commerce. Achieving full seamlessness of
   Internet networks will be impossible if the networks'
   builders must maneuver through inconsistent laws and
   policies. Not only are the policies of many nations in
   conflict, but so are policies within nations -- and to such
   an extreme that some seem mutually exclusive.
   A good example is encryption policy. Encryption technology
   scrambles digital communications to make them
   indecipherable to anyone except the intended receiver. The
   users range from businesses that transmit confidential data
   to individuals who send personal E-mail messages.
   Widespread availability of encryption is a prerequisite for
   enhancing security and privacy on the Internet, for
   engendering a mature electronic marketplace and even for
   helping the work of law enforcement.
   Yet governments resist removing old restrictions on the
   export and use of encryption technology -- rules that date
   from the cold war -- even as they proclaim pro-market
   intentions and stress greater Internet privacy and security
   as priorities.
   Fortunately, growing numbers of key policy makers in the
   advanced democracies are showing a clearer, more
   technologically sophisticated understanding of the
   Internet. They grasp that while government financed the
   start of the Internet, the absence of government has
   largely allowed it to take off like a rocket.
   Within this group are members of Congress like Senators
   Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana, and Patrick Leahy,
   Democrat of Vermont, and Representative Bob Goodlatte,
   Republican of Virginia, who are pushing to liberalize
   encryption export controls.
   Another is Ira C. Magaziner, the White House adviser who
   oversaw the development of a major Administration policy
   paper, released earlier this month, on electronic commerce.
   The paper, which advocated a largely hands-off approach by
   Government to Internet regulation, is a breakthrough in
   electronic commerce policy. Its perspective is properly
   global; its delineated goals, highly commendable.
   Particularly laudable is its proposal to designate the
   Internet as a tariff-free zone.
   The Internet is now perhaps the most global and democratic
   form of communications. No other medium can so easily
   render outdated our traditional distinctions among
   localities, regions and nations. While the Internet
   increasingly knows no boundaries, it still knows barriers
   all too well -- obstacles that are too often born of
   technological ignorance leading to incoherent public
   policy.
   The world cannot afford policies that impede the
   development of the Internet, diminish its utility and limit
   its social reach. And much more could be at stake than
   seamless digital networks. We may find that the more we
   succeed in removing barriers to Internet communications,
   the more we may help reduce those other, far more important
   obstructions to human communications -- the ones that
   divide nations and estrange demographic groups.
   That, ultimately, could be the most far-reaching, enduring
   benefit of an unfettered global Internet.

@_subject: NRO: Risky Methods of Data Exploitation 
Wonder what's meant by "risky methods" NRO envisions in the article below by:
     "Using advanced and potentially technologically risky
     methods of exploiting data to learn more from it."
     30 July 1997, Jane's Defence Weekly
     NRO opens up to new satellite system ideas      For the first time in its history, the once super-secret      National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) is considering whether
     commercial space technology can satisfy its `customer'
     requirements for reconnaissance data needed by the DoD and
     the intelligence community.      In existence for over 30 years, the NRO is coming in from
     the cold for one clear reason: acquisition and operation of US
     reconnaissance satellites continues to account for most of the
     $28 billion in annual spending by the US intelligence
     community. Congress wants to find ways to trim the bill by
     encouraging the NRO to adopt commercial technology and
     move towards launching smaller, less expensive satellites.      The question of whether the NRO should continue to exist
     was an open debate last year. A panel chaired by Adm David
     Jeremiah, former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
     concluded that the unique partnership between the Director of
     Central Intelligence and the Defense Secretary to build,
     operate and manage space-based intelligence systems should
     continue in the form of the NRO.      "There are important inter-relationships between the NRO and
     DoD space activities in areas such as launch technology,
     industrial base and communications, and the NRO needs to
     use DoD systems such as the Global Positioning System as
     well as the DoD needs to use products from NRO systems,"
     the report said. However the panel also emphasised that all of
     the relationships between the NRO and the Pentagon need
     clarification.      NRO Director Keith Hall is driving much of the process at the
     agency towards opening the door to commercial technology
     and improving the agency. "I do not think that a customer
     that needs a picture to answer a key question to make an
     operational decision cares whether that picture comes from
     one of my satellites, an airplane or a commercial sensor
     system," he said. "If that means a commercial system can
     provide some of that, I am entirely for it."      A major vehicle for operational change at the NRO is the
     Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) programme aimed at
     fielding a next-generation space-based imagery intelligence
     (IMINT) system. "We have said to our FIA vendors that they
     are free to propose to us a mixed architecture of government
     systems and commercial systems," said Hall, noting that such
     a notion is indeed a first for the agency. "We have not
     heretofore been involved at all in the acquisition of
     commercial imagery."      The FIA may set a precedent for future reconnaissance
     acquisition. In mid-1996, the NRO and the old Central
     Imagery Office, now part of the NIMA, concluded an initial
     `Phase A' of an architecture study which detailed the
     attributes of a future imagery system most wanted by NRO
     customers. It resulted in the identification of more than 20
     varying performance levels.      The NRO began what it calls the `Phase B' concept
     programme in May last year. It is working with six
     contractor teams and the NIMA to determine "what utility
     would those differences in performance have," said Hall, who
     became director in March.      The NRO expects to publish a final `Phase C' solicitation to
     industry with detailed performance specifications by early
     next year. Hall said that the solicitation will have "objective
     requirements and the relative value the government places on
     them".      Contractors will not be told precisely how to meet those
     requirements but only the performance objectives. `Phase C'
     will be separated into a satellite segment and an integration
     and ground segment. "We have some vendors that are bidding
     on all segments so theoretically a single contractor could win
     it all," said Hall. A final contract award is expected late next
     year with the first satellite system due to be flying early in the
     next decade.      Hall also said that smaller satellites will be considered in the
     FIA as well as other constellations. Although they present
     some technical challenges, constellations of smaller satellites
     mean that more satellites will be on orbit, leading to more
     frequent `revisits' over targets and less overall system
     degradation if one satellite fails.      The FIA programme has already led to some innovation. The
     small Surveillance, Targeting and Reconnaissance Satellite
     (Starlite) being proposed by the Defense Advanced Research
     Projects Agency (DARPA) for tactical reconnaissance could
     be considered as a future imagery architecture option.
     However, it appears more likely it will become a technology
     demonstration.      DARPA's proposal underscores the dilemma of how to draw
     a distinction between reconnaissance - an NRO mission - and
     surveillance, which traditionally has been done by the US Air
     Force in monitoring weather and missile launches for
     example. "We will do more joint programmes with multiple
     sensors," predicted Maj Gen Robert Dickman, the DoD space
     architect.      As the NRO and DoD grow closer, Hall believes it is
     important to acknowledge that commercial systems can only
     go so far in meeting the precise resolution and product
     delivery requirements needed by the IC.      Aside from fielding the FIA, Hall has set a number of other
     objectives for the agency, including increasing funding for
     research and development by re- allocating existing funds. His
     five mission objectives in research and development are:      - Developing new sources and methods, such as collection
     and processing of information against hard targets;      - Orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency and
     effectiveness of NRO systems;      - Using advanced and potentially technologically risky
     methods of exploiting data to learn more from it;      - Using space-based solutions to address "intractable"
     intelligence problems such as monitoring chemical and
     biological warfare facilities;      - Improving "space services" by assisting the US Defense
     Department with its space mission when possible.      -----

Finally, a Boss was reached who said the site was "intentionally pulled." He claimed that it was "not a serious problem, so don't be alarmed," and sang cheerily about "some files" without elaboration.
Maybe more next week, and we pray it turns out to be hysterically

     Report/ Encryption policy hurts trade      U.S. controls on the export of encryption technology and
     telecommunications equipment represent significant barriers
     to international trade, the European Commission said in a
     report last week.      The development of digital communications has prompted the
     need for improved protection against the unauthorized use of
     personal data, trade secrets, banking information and
     databases. Without that protection, it is unlikely that
     electronic commerce will take off, said one European
     Commission official.      The commission's 13th annual ``Report on United States
     Barriers to Trade and Investment'' said the U.S. is the
     dominant supplier of key computing components, and the
     country's limitations on the export of strong encryption
     products hurts the growth of electronic commerce. Anyone with a URL for this report? The EC site is uncrackably

Still, it's odd we did not get a call about the problem as was done
a few weeks ago for a similar warez invasion. At that time, we offered to close our ftp, but the PrimeHost rep said no, we'll monitor it, as we do other ftps. I specifically asked to be notified if it
happened again, but wasn't. And it's not clear why it took a
week for me to find out what was what. Or why not AOL did not
just close the ftp and leave the http operating.

@_subject: Shor's Algorithms: Mad, Bad and Dangerous 
by David Deutsch (Allan lane, 390 pp., $29.95):
  Using something called "Shor's algorithm," a quantum
  computer can factor giant numbers and thereby break
  secret codes that no conventional computer could touch.
  The only way it could do this, Mr Deutsch argues, is by
  distributing its operations over many parallel universes.
  "To those who cling to a single-universe world-view,"
  he writes with evident asperity," I issue the challenge:
  *explain how Shor's algorithms works.*"
  Combining the many-universes notion with quantum probablity,
  and adding elements of Darwinism and Karl Popper's theory
  of knowledge, Mr. Deutsch apsires to nothing less than a
  complete understanding of "the fabric of reality." Arrogant
  in tone and marred by leaps of logic, his book nonetheless
  bristles with subversive insights about virutal reality,
  time travel, mathematical certainty and free will.   Intellectually speaking, Mr. Deutsch is mad, bad and   dangerous to know.

Comments on two of the many HOPE sessions: those of L0pht and Bruce Schneier:
L0pht summarized their current campaign to test
security on behalf of the consumer, having found
that corporations refuse to publicize or correct
holes L0pht reported in confidence.
L0pht cited, among others, the Mac security features and products coming to market, which they think have been too hastily readied for grafting onto other programs and and are vulnerable due to inadequate design, integration and testing. Like too many MS flood-the-market programs.
Bruce outlined the principal elements of the security
challenge and the role of cryptography among those
of people, hardware, facilities, law and policy. He
warned of the weakness of relying on crypto in the overall security matrix and cautioned that crypto is not the main answer to the security problem, which is primarily one of human frailty and criminal behavior, and that it will take a combination of solutions involving:   Strong and efficient encryption -- key length is   not critical
  Tamper resistant hardware -- software can be protected   by math
  Trust management -- reliable authentication and   certification; GAK is too complicated to ever work
  Jurisdiction -- criminals must not be able to operate   from the most obliging state
  Law -- punishment for criminal acts
He emphasized that mathematics and software are not the problem of insecure systems, it is humans and the impossibility
of predictable interface with machines. Every system is vulnerable
to attack, not at its strongest but at its weakest. Brute force
is not an attack worth worrying about, although it gets most
of the publicity. What's worrisome is the out of the way fault
in the fortress, the one nobody expects, the one the enemy
ever seeks by hook, crook, bribe and trick. (HOPE's agenda?)
It was a provocative, informative, many-faceted presentation,
and could become an article, maybe a book, surely an
effective business lure.
He closed by citing "Those who think cryptography is the answer
to security do not understand the problem and do not understand Bruce did not provide paper copy of the slides but said he

New York - Best-selling author Tom Clancy signed a 24-paperback deal with a division of Penguin Putnam Inc.
that is expected to be announced today, according to people close to the deal.
Berkley Publishing Group is paying an advance of approximately $22 million according to these people. The series, set in the near future, will include six adult and 18 juvenile novels.
Berkley will publish the series, "Tom Clancy's Netforce," over the next four to six years. In the books, the Internet and virtual reality have melded so that people spend most of their time on-line. The technology proves irresistible to terrorists and anticomputer zealots, who
are pursued by the Netforce.
The agreement comes on the heels of another deal Mr. Clancy recently made with Penguin, a unit of London media

R.I. Passes Body Fluid Felony Law
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Inmates on the East Coast refer to it as
``serving'' a prison guard, while in the West it's called ``gassing.'' Guards know it simply as being splashed or smeared with urine or feces. ``It's a badge of honor to serve an officer,'' said Richard Loud, president
of the Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers. ``When an officer
gets served, the other inmates all cheer. They think it's a big joke.'' Rhode Island is among the states that have adopted laws to crack down on the
activity. A bill signed July 1 by Gov. Lincoln Almond makes throwing bodily
fluids or wastes a felony punishable by up to five more years behind bars
and a $5,000 fine. New York adopted a similar law last year, although, unlike the one in Rhode
Island, it didn't include saliva. ``I think Rhode Island probably has one of the best laws in the country,''
said Stephen Chand, director of federal affairs for the Law Enforcement
Alliance of America. Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., has sponsored federal legislation requiring
that inmates be tested for the AIDS virus if their bodily fluid or waste
touches a guard. Two such assaults occur a month at Rhode Island's state prison, Loud said
Tuesday. Some believe the punishment is excessive. ``We think it is a harsh reaction to a non-issue,'' said Steve Brown,
executive director of the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union. ``I think in most cases this will involve spitting. Inmates shouldn't
be spitting on guards, but certainly it doesn't merit a five-year prison
sentence.'' The act has been taking place for years in prisons, but such bills are
gaining strength because of the fear of AIDS. ``The scientific and medical evidence is abundantly clear that it is
virtually impossible to get infected with the HIV virus through that sort of
conduct,'' Brown said. Prisons already can punish inmates by placing them in solitary confinement
or revoking other privileges, or can try them for misdemeanor assault, Brown
said. But authorities have had trouble prosecuting inmates under the
misdemeanor assault law, said Rep. Joseph McNamara, D-Warwick, the bill's
sponsor. ``It's difficult to prove intent to do harm,'' McNamara said. However, he said, the fact that different slang terms exist for the act in
various parts of the country show how much a part of prison culture it is.

@_subject: Draft CCL Encryption Items Rule 
We've received from anonymous a July 25 draft of an Encryption
Items Interim Rule for the Export Administration Regulations
which describes Commerce Control List changes in response to public comments on the December 30, 1996 interim rule.
     (82K)
The draft is in Federal Register format but, as far as we have been
able to find, has not been published there. So if this doc was published
we'd like to hear.
Assuming the draft is legitimate, here's its summary of provisions (much
expanded in the full document):
[Begin summary]
Based on public comments to the December 30 interim rule, this interim rule
specifically makes the following changes:
- In §732.2, clarifies that BXA will consider acknowledgments and
assurances in electronic form provided that they are adequate to assure
legal undertakings similar to written acknowledgments and assurances.
- In §734.3, clarifies that downloading or causing the downloading of
encryption source code and object code in Canada is not controlled and does
not require a license, and clarifies that the methods used as precautions
to prevent unauthorized transfer of such code outside the United States or
Canada must be approved by BXA.
- In §740.6, clarifies that letters of assurance may be accepted in the
form of a letter or any other written communication from the importer,
including communications via facsimile.
- In §740.8, adds recovery encryption technology to the list of items
eligible for export under License Exception KMI, after a one-time review,
and adds a paragraph to authorize exporters of non-key recovery products
under License Exception KMI to service and support existing customers of
those products after the two-year transition period.  This section is also
amended by adding a paragraph to authorize exporters of non-recovery
encryption products under License Exception KMI to export additional
quantities of such products to existing customers under a license after the
two-year transition period.
- §740.8 is also amended by adding a new paragraph to authorize, after a
one-time review, exports and reexports under License Exception KMI of
non-key recovery financial-specific encryption items of any key length that
are restricted by design (e.g., highly field-formatted with validation
procedures, and not easily diverted to other end-uses)  for financial
applications to secure financial transactions, for end-uses such as intra
or inter-banking transfers and home banking.  No business and marketing
plan to develop, produce, and/or market similar encryption items with
recoverable features is required. Conforming changes are also made in
- In §740.9, removes the reference to Country Group D:1.  This clarifies
that encryption software controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 may be
pre-loaded on a laptop and exported under the tools of trade provisions of
License Exception TMP or License Exception BAG.
- In §740.14, clarifies existing provisions of License Exception BAG and
imposes a restriction on the use of BAG for exports or reexports of
EI-controlled items to terrorist supporting destinations or by other than
U.S. citizens and permanent residents.
-  §742.15 is amended adding a new paragraph that authorizes exports under
an Encryption Licensing Arrangement of general purpose non-key recovery,
non-voice encryption items of any key length for use by financial
institutions (such as banks) in all destinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq,
Libya, North Korea, Syria and Sudan.  Applications will be reviewed on a
case-by-case basis, and must be supported by a satisfactory business and
marketing plan which explains in detail the steps the applicant will take
during the two year transition period beginning January 1, 1997 to develop,
produce, and/or market similar encryption items with recoverable features.
- In Supplement No. 4 to part 742, paragraph (3), revises "reasonable
frequency" to "at least once every three hours" to resolve the ambiguity on
how often the output must identify the key recovery agent and
material/information required to decrypt the ciphertext.
- In Supplement No. 4 to part 742, paragraph (6)(i), clarifies that the
U.S. government must be able to obtain the key(s) or other
material/information needed to decrypt all data, without restricting the
means by which the key recovery products allow this.
- In Supplement No. 6 to part 742, eliminates the test vector requirement
for 7-day mass-market classification requests and replaces it with a
requirement to provide a copy of the encryption subsystem source code.
-  In Supplement No. 6 to part 742, adds 40-bit DES as being eligible for
consideration for mass-market eligibility, subject to the additional
criteria listed in this supplement.
- In §§ 748.9 and 748.10, clarifies a long-standing policy that no support
documentation is required for exports of technology or software, and it
removes the requirement for such support documentation for exports of
technology or software to Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland,
Romania, or Slovakia.  This rule also exempts from support documentation
requirements all encryption items controlled under ECCNs 5A002, 5B002,
5D002 and 5E002.  This conforms with the practice under the ITAR prior to
December 30, 1996.
- In §750.7, authorizes certain specified changes to Commerce and State
Encryption Licensing Arrangements by letter.
- In §752.3, excludes encryption items controlled for EI reasons from
eligibility for a Special Comprehensive License.
- In §770.2, adds a new interpretation to clarify that encryption software
controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 may be pre-loaded on a laptop
and exported under the tools of trade provision of License Exception TMP or
the personal use exemption under License Exception BAG, subject to the
terms and conditions of such License Exceptions.
- In part 772, adds new definitions for "effective control", "encryption
licensing arrangement", "financial institution" and "recovery encryption
- In Supplement No. 1 to part 774, Category 5 - Telecommunications and
Information Security is amended by revising ECCN 5A002 to authorize exports
of components and spare parts under License Exception LVS, provided the
value of each order does not exceed $500 and to clarify that equipment for
the encryption of interbanking transactions is not controlled under that
- Revises the phrase "up to 56-bit key length DES" where it appears to read
"up to or equal to 56-bit key length DES", and makes other editorial

   Hackers' Paradise: Get Wealthy Legally By Cracking a Code
   Crypto-Logic Offers to Pay $1 Million to the Breaker Of
   Encryption for E-Mail    By Rodney Ho
   A start-up company would like you to hack your way to $1
   million.
   Crypto-Logic Corp. of Austin, Texas, claims to have created
   an encryption system for electronic mail so foolproof that
   it can't be broken. If someone can figure out a special
   encrypted e-mail message within a year, the company says it
   will pay a reward of $1 million.
   But wait. The technology Crypto-Logic is using for the
   contest hasn't exactly been foolproof. The three computers
   needed to create the contest's Web site unexpectedly
   scrambled data in the site last week, said David Neeley,
   vice president and chief operating officer.
   The breakdown forced him to backtrack from last week's
   announcement that the contest would begin last Friday.
   Instead, he spent several days attempting to fix the
   computers, but to no avail. On Monday, he had to get
   replacement computers. "I've got thousands of dollars worth
   of machinery that's not worth blowing up," he grouses. But
   he adds, "I regard this as my screw-up. In this world,
   there are no excuses." He finally got the contest running
   Wednesday, at    On the bright side, cryptologists agree that the
   decades-old encryption method that Crypto-Logic is claiming
   to use -- called a "one-time pad" -- is theoretically
   unbreakable. Each "pad" has a set of uniquely random
   digital symbols that are coded to the actual message. The
   recipient uses the same symbols to decrypt the message. The
   pads are used only once.
   To limit the possibility of leaks, Crypto-Logic Chairman
   Stan Spence is the only person who knows the message that
   was encrypted. The solution is kept in a NationsBank vault
   in Austin, Mr. Spence says. In addition, Mr. Neeley says
   the $1 million is backed by an insurance company he won't
   name.
   Several other companies have held similar contests,
   typically offering more modest sums.
   Jim Bidzos, president of RSA Data Security Inc. in Redwood
   City, Calif., says his company frequently holds break-the-
   code contests to test how tough certain encryption systems
   are. But he and other security experts are skeptical of
   Crypto-Logic's assertions. "Anyone who says their system is
   bulletproof is either a liar or stupid," says Winn
   Schwartau, a Largo, Fla., security expert.
   Mr. Neeley admits his integrity is on the line. "If I'm
   wrong," he notes, "we're out of business."

   We've been receiving from Bill Payne, ex-Sandia cryptographer,

Sandia scientists and staff as the budgets decline and piddling
new missions are sought, while facing the congressional threat to close all the labs and the entire Department of Energy. We'll offer
one of the astute assessments shortly which describes the
bind imported managers are in to turn the labs into dog-eat-dog corporate sweatshops, and how the not so dumb scientists are learning to fuck with the heads of the hatcheters, refusing to work,
bickering, prolonging disputes, sabotaging projects, maybe/maybe not whispering secrets to bad people in other countries, or worst of all, disclosing vital national information to commercial interests, that
is, outfox management by arranging a private deal.
As the NY Times recently reported on the fearsome threats nuclear weapons scientists are making to keep funding coming, noting that the Russians are doing the same, all rather brilliantly saying: keep us "peacekeepers" doing the dirty work happy or suffer the consequences when the loyal patriotic guards go over the fence, or simpler, open the gates, that is sell the PAL codes, barter the diagrams, to maintain our "entitlement".
Yep, the Sandia manager claims that the best and brightest scientists
of the US believe that their dole should be for life. Or they are going to
get very black market ammo oriented, that's market-Oriented.

The GAO reports that the B-2 stealth bomber cannot fly in the rain,
which transforms stealth technology into junk. Moreover, the fragile machine needs strict atmospheric control in the hangar or its skin rots and delicate innards peter out, and because there are none of the luxurious digs overseas, the plane cannot be deployed closer to targets, thereby limiting its threat. The problem is apparently unsolvable for less than the cost of the plane itself, so they've got to be pickled and coddled indefinitely or thrown away.

to save money, it's pretty certain that the price of war games will eventually rise to cost exactly the same as an actual war, indeed
will make war a cheaper alternative.
What's a wonder is that GAO never finds serious fault with any of
the government programs it judiciously investigates. Instead, after due research, request for comments from those investigated, and
fair deliberation, the somewhat tawdry matters at hands merely require additional funding for fine tuning and keep the congressional sponsors happy to fund the programs, the watch-dogs and shrewdly voting taxpayers doing what needs to be done to complain and bank

I'd like to applaud all those who've been working on this legal hack for
years now, keeping flatfeet to fire. For mind-opening, hard-headed reading, in addition to Froomkin and Bernstein, see the briefs on Karn and Junger, see Gilmore's files, study all the crypto sites which show the depth of
research that has often had to be ripped out of the government'g tight paws still fiercely resisting loss of control over "the national interest."
Tim's "crazy man" threat, artfully delineated in his CA Manifesto and Cyphernomicon, who might just do what "rational minds" won't, is also to be admired for reminding the insiders that not everyone abides the rules of the court when they are not wisely applied for this time and these newly divergent, even anarchic, interests. Read Tim for inspiration when the
briefs numb, then go back and study the briefs some more, and you'll
see that they don't read the same, there's more fire there than appears
at first glance, then return to Tim and see that, well, god damn, so that's what he's saying and we've not been really hearing. Shit, he's crazier, the briefs are crazier, the government's crazier than rational minds can
bear to believe.
When you can't take them any more, read Duncan Frissell, and freak with

CNN Online, 26 August 1997:
Encryption rules rejected Judge says federal regulations barring unlicensed exports unconstitutional San Francisco, Aug 25 (Reuter) - U.S. government regulations on the export
of encryption software are unconstitutional, a federal judge ruled on Monday. U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel said licensing requirements
for the export of encryption software and related devices were an
unconstitutional prior restraint on First Amendment free speech rights.
Patel also issued a permanent injunction barring the government
from enforcing the regulations against plaintiff Daniel Bernstein or anyone
who sought to use, discuss or publish his encryption program.
Encryption involves running a readable message though a computer
program that translates the message according to an equation or algorithm
into unreadable "ciphertext."

5 September 1997, MSNBC:
FBI Director Louis Freeh floats a new proposal at a congressional hearing to outlaw non-breakable crypto products.
A radical shift in crypto debate
Proposed bill outlaws non-crackable crypto products, restrict imports
By Brock N. Meeks, MSNBC
WASHINGTON -- The White House would likely be very sympathetic to a
controversial new bill that would outlaw all encryption software that doesn't allow law enforcement agencies to immediately decode scrambled messages, an administration official told MSNBC.
The new bill, still in draft form, is quietly circulating among members of the House and Senate. Although the administration hasn't formally endorsed any provisions of the bill, MSNBC has learned that the White House has been providing what is called technical drafting assistance
to members of Congress writing the bill. William Reinsch, the Commerce Department undersecretary for export administration, confirmed the White House involvement for MSNBC on Thursday night.
The draft bill was already in the hands of some members of the Senate's Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government Regulation when FBI Director Louis Freeh outlined its basic provisions while testifying before
the panel Wednesday. Freeh said "we would recommend" that legislation be written requiring all encryption software or services made in or imported to the United States to have a feature "which would allow for the immediate, lawful decryption" of any scrambled messages used for illegal purposes or in a national security matter.
NATION AT RISK?
The White House, FBI and intelligence agencies claim that the proliferation of unbreakable encryption products puts the nation at risk. Criminals and terrorists are increasingly using unbreakable encryption products, Freeh
testified Wednesday. U.S. makers of encryption software claim that any government-mandated decoding features would make their products unacceptable to clients in the global marketplace. The new proposals outlined by Freeh also drew the ire of civil
liberties groups, which fear that any government controls on encryption products raise serious First Amendment and privacy concerns.
Placing such government-mandated controls on the domestic use and manufacture of encryption software, as well as on the import of encryption products, stands in marked contrast to current White House crypto policies. Currently,
the United States places strict regulations on the export of any encryption products that do make decoding keys available to law enforcement agencies. However, the administration has steadfastly maintained throughout the often
contentious public debate over encryption policies that it would not place any restrictions on the domestic use of encryption software, nor would it
restrict the import of encryption products. Despite Freeh's testimony and the draft legislation written with White House assistance, Reinsch said the administration's policy on encryption hasn't changed. "I want to emphasize that [in providing drafting assistance] we are
responding to committee requests," he said. "And those requests have been fairly directive, such as: 'Give us some examples of how we can better accommodate law enforcement needs.' " Currently, the White House is backing an encryption bill in the Senate called the Secure Public Networks Act, also known as S. 909. This bill would encourage the use of and set up guidelines for encryption software products with decoding keys. Under this plan, all coded messages would spin off a decoding key that would be stored with a government-approved third party. Law enforcement agencies, foreign or domestic, would be allowed access to those keys if they obtained a court-ordered warrant. The bill would not restrict or require any encryption software used in the United States, or restrict the import of any foreign crypto products. However, MSNBC has learned that the draft bill now circulating among members of the House and Senate specifically outlaws the "manufacture, distribution or import" of any encryption software product or communication device that does not "allow the immediate decryption" of all scrambled messages or communications "if used for illegal purposes." The bill also targets "network services," such as Internet Service Providers, that provide encryption capabilities to their clients.
BAN WOULD GO INTO EFFECT IN 1999
Under this proposed bill, if such encryption services are offered by a company like ISP, the service provider must build in a provision to allow
for immediate decryption of any scrambled messages, according to several sources that have seen the draft language. The software ban would
go into effect in January 1999.
Reinsch told MSNBC he wasn't sure that Freeh's testimony "accurately reflected" the language the White House offered in its technica
drafting for congressional committees. However, he indicated the administration was interested in Freeh's proposal.
"I'll be blunt about it," Reinsch said. If such a bill were approved by a congressional committee, the administration "would look very seriously at it and I imagine we would be very sympathetic to it," he said.
Opponents of proposals to require key for all encryption software blanched at Freeh's statements. "This proposal crosses a line that hasn't been crossed before in the area of domestic controls on crypto," said Alan
Davidson, policy analyst for the Center for Democracy and Technology. Davidson said a government mandate to provide immediate decryption capabilities would be like "forcing everyone to live in a glass house."
It also "trashes the Fourth Amendment," which guarantees a right to be protected from unlawful search and seizure, Davidson said.
Freeh told the Senate panel Wednesday that he isn't looking to expand law enforcement's investigative powers. Rather, he said, he is only looking for a "Fourth Amendment that works in the Information Age."

3. Finds the SAFE bill unhelpful but likes its crypto-criminalization

  Expressly confirm the freedom of domestic users to choose   any type or strength of encryption.
  Explicitly state that participation in a key management   infrastructure is voluntary .

As the U.S. Congress prepares to adopt a state-of-the-art
encryption program with a secret key that would allow
government access to all electronic communications, a
brilliant codemaker stands ready to expose the program's
critical flaw. Together with a determined band of
cypherpunks and hacker activists, he plans to unveil his
own code, which will ensure the privacy of all communication
on the Internet -- and that not even the government will
hold the key.
Fresh out of law school, Harry Garnet walks straight into

up with the man's clever daughter, Annie Ames, to track
the killer. Ther journey leads from a sleepy Adirondack
town to New York city, where -- with the inadvertent help
of Harry's scheming hacker friend Blaney -- Harry learns of the professor's connection to the anarchists and computer
phreaks who make up the underground Urban Crypto Militia.
The group's leader, Lionel Sullivan, is as talented a
codemaker as the professor had been. As the only one of
the bomber's intended victims who has managed to survive,
he can also offer Harry and Anne crucial insights into the
killer's motives. But it's not long before the bomber strikes
again -- this time against Harry and Annie, who still possess
the professor's secret computer files.
In a riveting race agaisnt time, Harry and Annie must navigate
secret networks and on-line fantasy worlds as they struggle to
unlock the professor's final message. It seems to point to a
fatal crack in the Patriot encryption program, which is about
to become the national standard -- and which Lionel and his
group are about to challenge in a dramatic showdown. Unless
the bomber gets to them first.

He made the point that few applications for electronic

And that the DoJ teams are quite adept at complying with the court's requirements, because all pass muster first of a special office set up for that purpose.
Judge Lambert said the job is "a lot of fun" because
its deals with supremely critical events of national
urgency, and that all the judges involved really do like it, especially the secrecy and prestige of being part of one of the most exclusive groups in Washington. This is not a joke.
Indeed, the Chief joked that the court's role "may be constitutional." And then said that he'll probably get in trouble for the statement.

There's considerable push coming from domestic law enforcement
agencies of many types and jurisdictions. See letters some of them have made in support of encryption controls in a House statement by Representative Weldon (co-sponsor with Dellums of the National Security Committee amendment to gut SAFE):
   These letters are regularly cited Freeh to show that the FBI and other
federal agencies are not alone in pushing for GAK, and to remind legislators that the law and order folks at home are a threat to re-election if they don't "give something to law enforcement."
And, Freeh often reminds that half of wiretaps are state rather than federal, as shown in the 1997 annual report on electronic surveillance:
   This is not to diminish the signficance of the burgeoning national security agencies, especially the 13 members of the intelligence community and those new-born aspirants for funds to protect the commonweal -- nearly every governmental jurisdiction now aims to grab a piece of the Nat Sec booty being converted to dual- and domestic-use, usually through various "justice" and "law enforcement" programs:
   An avid drumbeater for more funding for protection against the nation's high-tech enemies (thus bringing the foreign wars home) is the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (PCCIP). See a recent news report on PCCIP's call for $1 billion to fight the homefront foe:
   In short, there is a growing list of self-interested domestic parties who have a stake in GAK and you can bet they are leaning on their legislators just as hard as the federal briefers who whisper secrets
and lies celebrated this week for 50 years of domestic deception in the national interest.
Domestic controls on crypto and other munitions are just as certain to
come as the export kind, and for the same reasons -- security of the
state. If there are insufficient external enemies to justify stupendous public expenditures, why, just cook up the internal kind -- as done in the 1900s, the 1920s, the 1930s, the 40s, the 50s, the 60s, and to this day.

For answer to this consider:
There a number of countries who believe they are under just that
kind of Pearl harbor attack from the US through high-tech information warfare, electronic surveillance and related crypto control demands, especially the requirement for GAK in US and foreign-made products.
US leaders insistence that the US be 1st before all others in information technology, rightfully scares the shit out of our allies who
are distrusting the US more and more, perhaps even giving them
ideas about getting together with US enemies to beat back the Microsoft of nations. A counter-strike Pearl Harbor may be in the offing because of US belligerence and threat of Pearl Harboring others. (Recall the frequent invocation of this term by US reps, perhaps a clue to pre-emptive aggression in the works.)
The harping of US leaders on unidentified threats is making non-US
folks rather nervous, not being sure that the US may not turn on
its allies for the slightest of missteps or demurs, and cut off the
bountiful flow of global intel -- as the TLAs are now threatening Congressional committees. Crypto Czar Arons world consultations
were apparently thinly veiled threats to compel GAK compliance.

               SUPPLEMENTAL VIEWS OF HON. LORETTA SANCHEZ
    Many of us when we think of encryption imagine the
``ENIGMA'' code breaking machines of World War Two or the
American Indian ``code talkers'' that helped us anticipate and
defeat Nazi and Imperial Japanese attacks. Those methods were
mechanical or human-based, and often depended on simple
arithmetical slight of hand to trick the enemy. Today,
encryption is complex mathematical algorithms that have become
an entirely new branch of mathematics involving intense
academic study.
    Until recently encryption was limited to governments and
large companies through U.S. export limitations and by the
limitations of existing hardware and software technologies. All
that began to change as the desktop computer became more
prevalent and the computing power available to the average user
jumped by leaps and bounds every year. When discussing the
power of the PC observers of the information technology
industry often predict that the computing power of
microprocessors would double roughly every 18 months.
    Because of this the rapidly developing speed and growth of
computers, the age of the ``unbreakable code'' has long since
passed. Manufacturers of encryption technology are engaged in a
rapidly accelerating race to develop the newest and strongest
code that can withstand attacks from the increasingly powerful
computers of the day. And it isn't just big companies and
governments that have the technology to break codes. Last
January, a graduate student broke a 40-bit code in just three-
and-a-half hours, the toughest code form American companies at
the time were allowed to export.
    Today, American companies are the world leaders in
encryption technology, but other companies and nations are
catching up. Strong encryption products and knowledge about the
science of cryptography is not limited to the United States. A
savvy computer user anywhere in the world can with just a few
clicks of the mouse find U.S. export-embargoed encryption. Many
freelancing code hackers maintain off-shore Internet meeting
sites to discuss the newest holes in encryption products.
    The proposed export controls which the Administration
argues helps to keep strong encryption out of the hands of
foreign adversaries will have little or no effect. Strong
encryption is available abroad and US companies are being put
at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace.
    With this bleak and seemingly hopeless picture in mind how
do we protect ourselves from the threat of rogue nations and
other adversaries cloaking their communications from American
National Security efforts? The only viable solution is through
supporting a robust and aggressively competitive cryptography
industry in the United States. We must ensure that the United
States continues to maintain the deepest pool of cryptographic
experts in the world. American export limitations will only
serve to create a brain drain of these precious resources as
leading scientists leave our shores for more lucrative and
accommodating surroundings.
    All of us care about our national security and no one wants
to make it any easier for criminals and terrorists to commit
criminal acts. But we must also recognize encryption
technologies as an increasingly sharp double-edged sword. It
can also aid law enforcement and protect national security by
limiting the threat of industrial espionage and foreign spying,
but only when Americans are able to produce the sharpest swords
and the strongest encryption.
    I would also like to state for the record that for the
reasons stated above, I do not support the Dellums-Weldon
Amendment to H.R. 695, and would have voted against it.
                                                   Loretta Sanchez.

Banning laptops continues a long tradition of congressional

Ex-AoCs sometimes leak the stupifying arguments the solons make for maintaining their supposedly superior lifestyles free of demanding gadgetry and popular fad: their preference is for human servants over devices in order

and opportunistic one-night-stand switching of lifetime fidelity.
Blinking, recording, error-archiving, machines scare the shit out of the the fork-tongue power-aphrodisiacal nymphomaniacs, not to say that the rest of us would act so differently given a seat in inner circles of jerks getting lapdanced on a magic carpet -- who wants that in the National Archives of Perfidy?
Often the reason folks oppose new technology is that it threatens
their network of operations based on old technology, as the
case with encryption.
Still, it's worth considering what leaked Senate plaintext (gov, pol, illicit)  would induce the secrecy-obsessed senators to support strong crypto for their own privacy of stashed wealth and squelched Paulas?
Often new technology is resisted because that it threatens
networks of successful operations of barely legal scams based on old technology, as the case with encryption, tv, radio, telephone, telegraph, printing, highways, roads, trails, stars, evil eyes, body stench, intuition, fear, mother's milk, amniotic warmth, egg and dart, downhole non-existence.

   Secrets: The CIA's War At Home
   Angus Mackenzie
   University of California Press
   Berkeley, 1997. 241 pp. $27.50
   ISBN 0-520-20020-9
"Secrets" decribes the origination of the Freedom of Information Act and other legislation to make government secrets available, the battles to get the laws passed and to defend them against subsequent attacks by proponents of secrecy who invoke the National Security Act.
Mackenzie sets out the ways the intelligence industry, helped by
the Department of Justice and the courts, manipulates the media, other governmental agencies and the citizenry by force and by seduction, with special attention to how it coopts its ostensible opponents like the ACLU and investigative journalists.
He documents the undisclosed arrangments between the CIA and the
media to favor journalism at the public's expense in legislation and
in working relations.
He carefully traces the long-running campaign to limit governmental employees from revealing what they know through various non-disclosure and lifetime secrecy agreements, sometimes breached
by ex-agency heads who reveal secrets to boost careers.
The book amply documents the ongoing struggle, now 50 years
underway, to open the archives of domestic spying, new attempts to limit public access to governmental information, and moves to invade privacy.
Here are the book's closing paragraphs:
   By the 1990s, reflecting the general conservative shift in
   Congress, many House members were actively welcoming a
   secrecy oath. Consideration of the oath, less comprehensive
   than the standard contract, first came up in the House Select
   Committee on Intelligence during a discussion of the fiscal year
   (FY) 1992 Intelligence Authorization Act. That led to a House
   rule requiring the intelligence committee members and staff to
   sign the oath. Interest in broadening the use of the oath did not
   stop there, especially for committee member Porter J. Goss of
   Florida. Goss's ties to the CIA dated from 1962 and his ten year
   stint as a clandestine service officer at the Agency. He and his
   fellow enthusiast, Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, offered amendments
   to the FY 1993 and 1994 authorization acts that would require
   secrecy oaths from every member of the House. The
   amendments did not prosper, but when the 104th Congress
   convened on January 4, 1995, backers of the oath changed
   tactics. This time the oath requirement for every House member
   was included in the packet of rules from the House Conference
   of the Majority. It became a new rule without debate.
   In the mid-1980s, Jeane Kirkpatrick sounded the alarm about
   government censorship. Although a member of the Reagan
   administration's inner foreign policy circle, Kirkpatrick had a
   personal encounter with government censors over her refusal to
   sign the lifetime secrecy contract. Upon returning to her political
   science chair at Georgetown University from her post as U.S.
   United Nations ambassador, Kirkpatrick reexamined John Stuart
   Mill's classic essay On Liberty and delivered a lecture on
   censorship. "Societies are not made stronger by the process of
   repression that accompanies censorship," she warned.
   "Censorship requires an assumption of infallibility, and that
   seems to Mill invariably negative. Repression of an opinion is
   thus bad for the censor, who inevitably acts from a conviction of
   his own infallibility," she told her students, "and bad for the
   opinion itself, which can neither be corrected nor held with
   conviction equal to the strength of an opinion submitted to
   challenge."
   As the twentieth century draws to a close, the 1947 National
   Security Act has become the Pandora's box that Ambassador
   Kirkpatrick and Congressman Hoffman had feared. Placing a
   legal barrier between foreign intelligence operations and
   domestic politics in the National Security Act has proved
   ineffectual. In the decades that followed 1947, the CIA not only
   became increasingly involved in domestic politics but abridged
   First Amendment guarantees of free speech and free press in a
   conspiracy to keep this intrusion from the American people. The
   intelligence and military secrecy of the 1940s had broadened in
   the 1960s to covering up the suppression of domestic dissent.
   The 1980s registered a further, more fundamental change, as
   the suppression of unpopular opinions was supplemented by
   systematic and institutionalized peacetime censorship for the
   first time in U.S. history. The repressive machinery developed by
   the CIA has spread secrecy like oil on water.
   The U.S. government has always danced with the devil of
   secrecy during wartime. By attaching the word "war" to the
   economic and ideological race for world supremacy between
   the Soviet Union and the United States, a string of
   administrations continued this dance uninterrupted for fifty
   years. The cold war provided the foreign threat to justify the
   pervasive Washington belief that secrecy should have the
   greatest possible latitude and openness should be restricted as
   much as possible -- constitutional liberties be damned.
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union as a world power in 1990,
   even the pseudo-war rationale evaporated. But the partisans of
   secrecy have not been willing to accept the usual terms of
   peacetime. They have made clear their intentions to preserve
   and extend the wartime system. They will find a rationalization: if
   not the threat of the Soviet Union, then the goal of economic
   hegemony. Thus the U.S. government now needs to keep
   secrets to give an advantage to American corporate interests.
   Yet it is entrepreneurs who have been making the most use of
   FOIA -- not journalists, not lawyers. As of 1994, the great
   preponderance of all FOIA requests have been for business
   purposes. As the framers of the Constitution understood, the
   free exchange of ideas is good for commerce, but this idea has
   been widely forgotten in the years since the passage of the 1947
   National Security Act.
   Only recently in the history of the world's oldest republic has
   secrecy functioned principally to keep the American people in
   the dark about the nefarious activities of their government. The
   United States is no longer the nation its citizens once thought: a
   place, unlike most others in the world, free from censorship and
   thought police, where people can say what they want, when they
   want to, about their government. Almost a decade after the end
   of the cold war, espionage is not the issue, if it ever really was.
   The issue is freedom, as it was for the Minute Men at Compo
   Hill. The issue is principle, as it was for Ernest Fitzgerald, who
   never signed a secrecy contract but retained his Pentagon job
   because he made his stand for the First Amendment resonate in
   Congress. Until the citizens of this land aggressively defend
   their First Amendment rights of free speech, there is little hope
   that the march to censorship will be reversed. The survival of
   the cornerstone of the Bill of Rights is at stake.

Phill warned Adam:
The WSJ reported recently on the comparatively lax security
of the principal US nodes of the Internet -- MAEs and such. The reporter located the facilities and spoke to several of the sys admins, most of whom were surprised at being IDed, and were reluctant to discuss security. Some did, though, and
shook their nogs at the ease with which the whole shebang could be trashed, claiming that for now it was only obscurity
that saved the net -- or at least its facilities -- and asked
the reporter not to tell the full story.
A similar report was written in a mag a few months back, with
a focus on the New Jersey facility (with photo), MAE, I think.
There was a discussion here in 1994 or so on the location of the landing points of transatlantic cables, many of which come
into New York City at obscure points along the coast, into
huts and shacks, actually, easily located by following the
cables shown on coastal maritime maps which neatly diagram every one of them to warn off shipping and dredging.
At that time some of the cpunks associated with the telco
and financial industries here (NYC) hinted at even worse security, especially the facilities kind, at the humongous hi-rise switching banks and highly accessible local distribution cablings into dank "secure" cells.
I pray that none of these remarks are seen as darkly conspiratorial, but merely chit-chat, like Phill's bark.

There are a number of US cases in the just published "Secrets:

What is worth exploring to supplement the perhaps too facile

growing worldwide as governments down-size, up-size and
sneaky-rig their NatSec and LE programs, often most slyly
by privatizing them behind false fronts.
Indeed, the bigger story may be the ways illegal electronic snooping is being hidden behind "legal" operations by both

Europeans Reject U.S. Plan On Electronic Cryptography    Threats to Privacy and Commerce Are Cited
By Edmund L. Andrews
Frankfurt, Oct. 8 -- The European Commission has rejected proposals by
the United States aimed at insuring that police agencies can crack coded
messages over telephone and computer networks.
In a lengthy report released today, the European Commission said the
American approach could threaten privacy and stifle the growth of
electronic commerce and that it might simply be ineffective.
The report appears to all but doom efforts by the Clinton Administration
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to establish a global system in
which people who use cryptography would have to deposit a "key" for
unlocking their codes with an independent outside organization. As
envisioned, the police or intelligence agents would be able to use this key
once they got court approval to carry out a wiretap. The plan has been
vigorously opposed by the computer industry, which fears that it would
jeopardize sales to foreign customers.
Because of the Internet's borderless nature, American officials have long
acknowledged that their plan is workable only if most other countries
adopt similar systems. If not, people could simply route their
communications through countries with no restrictions.
The White House had already run into heavy opposition from civil rights
groups, the computer industry and Congressional Republicans. And
earlier this year, the United States failed to muster any support for its plan
from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a
consortium backed by more than 40 countries.
But the European Commission's blunt opposition, reported today in The
Wall Street Journal, went considerably further, raising a slew of objections
to "key recovery" and "key escrow," systems. Among them were these:
+ Hackers could find new ways to breach security." Inevitably, any key
access scheme introduces additional ways to break into a cryptographic
system," the report said.
+ The systems could weaken European data-privacy laws. "Any regulation
hindering the use of encryption products," the report said, "hinders the
secure and free flow of personal information."
+ Even with a "key escrow" or "key recovery" system, criminals cannot be
entirely prevented from using strong encryption.
More broadly, the European Commission said, any kind of key-based
system could jeopardize the rise of electronic commerce. "If citizens and
companies have to fear that their communication and transactions are
monitored with the help of key access or similar schemes," the report
said, "they may prefer remaining in the anonymous off-line world."
American officials did not disguise their disappointment, and challenged
the Europeans to come up with better alternatives.
"I am a little surprised," said William Reinsch, Deputy Secretary of
Commerce in charge of export administration. "My question to the
European Commission is, where do they think the market is going? Our
sense is that corporations engaged in electronic commerce want key
recovery in some form, because they want to recover their own records
and to monitor their own employees."
Beyond high-minded policy issues, European officials quietly
acknowledge that they have political and economic concerns. For one
thing, several countries do not like the idea of deferring to an American
system that might allow American companies to dominate the next
generation of security products.
The German Government, meanwhile, is worried that American authorities
might have improper access to data on German users -- possibly violating
Germany's tough new laws on data protection.
But the European Union is far from united. Britain has generally sided with the United States in supporting an international system for
regulating data encryption.
Indeed, the European Commission remained vague about what
alternatives to the American system it might actually favor, nor does the
report attempt to block member countries from setting up key-based
systems if they want to.
American computer and software companies greeted the European policy
declaration as a victory.
"Even the hard-line Governments, the U.S. and the United Kingdom, have
said that any cryptography restrictions have to be internationally
coordinated because otherwise you can just download material from
another country," said Chris Kuner, a lawyer in Frankfurt who represents
Netscape Communications and other networking companies in Europe.
"This shows that Europe does not agree with the idea of mandatory key
recovery. This idea that is the only possible regulatory framework for the
world has been clearly rejected."

Excerpt below of statement on encryption policy by Senate Majority Leader Lott published in the October 21 Congressional Record.
Full statement at:        (12K)
Senator Lott:
  During the past month, the FBI has attempted to change the debate by proposing a series of new mandatory controls on the domestic sale and use of encryption products. Let me be clear. There are currently no restrictions on the rights of Americans to use encryption to protect their personal financial or medical records or their private e-mail messages. There have never been domestic limitations, and similarly, American businesses have always been free to buy and use the strongest possible encryption to protect sensitive information from being stolen or changed. But now, the FBI proposes to change all that.
  The FBI wants to require that any company that produces or offers encryption security products or services guarantee immediate access to plain text information without the knowledge of the user. Their proposal would subject software companies and telecommunications providers to prison sentences for failure to guarantee immediate access to all information on the desktop computers of all Americans. That would move us into an entirely new world of surveillance, a very intrusive surveillance, where every communication by every individual can be accessed by the FBI.
  Where is probable cause? Why has the FBI assumed that all Americans are going to be involved in criminal activities? Where is the   And how would this proposal possibly help the FBI? According to a forthcoming book by the M.I.T. Press, of the tens of thousands of cases handled annually by the FBI, only a handful have involved encryption of any type, and even fewer involved encryption of computer data. Let's face it--despite the movies, the FBI solves its cases with good old-
fashioned police work, questioning potential witnesses, gathering material evidence, and using electronic bugging or putting microphones on informants. Restricting encryption technology in the U.S. would not be very helpful to the FBI.
  The FBI proposal won't work. I have talked with experts in the world of software and cryptography, who have explained that the technology which would provide compliance with the FBI standard simply does not exist. The FBI proposal would force a large unfunded mandate on our high technology firms, at a time when there is no practical way to accomplish that mandate.
  Rather than solve problems in our export policy, this FBI proposal would create a whole new body of law and regulations restricting our domestic market.
  This and similar proposals would also have a serious impact on our foreign market. Overseas businesses and governments believe that the U.S. might use its keys to computer encryption systems to spy on their businesses and politicians. Most U.S. software and hardware manufacturers believe this is bad for business and that nobody will trust the security of U.S. encryption products if this current policy continues. In fact, this proposal appears to violate the European Union's data-privacy laws, and the European Commission is expected to reject it this week.
  So, the FBI proposal would: Invade our privacy; be of minimal use to the FBI; would require nonexistent technology; would create new administrative burdens; and would seriously damage our foreign markets.
  This is quite a list.
  Mr. President, the FBI proposal is simply wrong. I have learned that even the administration does not support this new FBI proposal. So why does the FBI believe it must now subject all Americans to more and more   This independent action by the FBI has created confusion and mixed signals which are troublesome for the Senate as it works on this legislation. Perhaps the FBI and the Justice Department need to focus immediately on a coordinated encryption position.
  Mr. President, I congratulate the members of the House Commerce Committee for rejecting this FBI approach by a vote margin of more than 2 to 1.

@_subject: David Kahn on National Encryption Policy 
This was published in the October 22 Congressional Record as
part of a statement by Senator Moynihan on the retirement of
NSA Deputy Director William Crowell:
                      [From Newsday, Oct. 6, 1997]
    National Security Official Retires--Helped Refocus Agency's Aims
                            (By David Kahn)
       The National Security Agency has said goodbye to its      retiring deputy director, who largely brought the super-
     secret spy organization into its public, post-Cold War      posture.
       William P. Crowell was the force behind the establishment      of the National Cryptologic Museum, which exhibits what had      been some of the nation's deepest secrets; the revelation of      the VENONA project, which broke Soviet spy codes early in the      Cold War; and the National Encryption Policy, which seeks to      balance personal privacy with national security.
       Succeeding Crowell will be Barbara McNamara, who, like      Crowell, is a career employee of the agency, which breaks      foreign codes and makes American Codes for the United States      government.
       McNamara is the second female deputy director of the      agency. The first, Ann Z. Caracristi, who served from 1980 to      1982, is the sister of the late Newsday photographer Jimmy      Caracristi.
       More than 500 present and past members of the agency      attended Crowell's recent retirement ceremony at its glossy,      triple-fenced headquarters at Fort Meade, Md. They applauded      as he was presented with awards for his intelligence and      executive services and with a folded American flag that had      flow over the agency.
       They laughed as a picture, claimed to be his retirement      portrait, was unveiled: It was a photograph of Crowell,      notorious for his love of motorcycles, astride his fancy      bike. During his acceptance speech, Crowell choked up when he      thanked his wife, Judy, a former agency employee and fellow      motorcyclist, for her help.
       The agency director, Air Force Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minihan,      recited some of the administrative landmarks of Crowell's      career.
       Crowell, 58, a native of Louisiana, began in New York City      in 1962 as an agency recruiter. In 1969, when he sought an      assignment to operations, he became instead an executive      assistant to the then-director. He eventually got to      operations, where he rose to be chief of W group, whose      function remains secret, and then chief of A group, which      focused on the then-Soviet Union. After a year in private      industry, he rose through other posts to the deputy      directorship on Feb. 2, 1994.
       Among his organizational accomplishments were conceiving a      crisis action center and linking the agency with other      producers of intelligence to improve information exchange.
       His more public initiatives included the museum and the      VENONA disclosures, which sought to maintain public support      for the agency after the disappearance of the Soviet Union.      The National Encryption Policy seeks to enable the agency to      read the messages of terrorists and international criminals      who use computer-based, unbreakable ciphers while enabling      individuals to use good cryptosecurity to preserve such      rights as security on the Internet.

"Self-reliance and socialism are diversions confected by
capitalism to conceal its evils," some poor bastard finally understood, muttered to nobody and died.
Nearly all governments are socialist to some degree
in that they provide services (bribes) that other social
structures do not; even the vilest must do so to fend off the hordes, rebels and revolutionists, or go broke funding
the military, guards, spies and police, as most eventually
do like the wealthy being sucked empty by their lawyers,
bankers, families and lovers.
Indeed, the most fervent proponents of coercive force
are those who have the greatest wealth to protect against
the folks trying to get it by all possible means. "More cops,
more laws, more education in obedience, more loyalty
oaths and prenupital 'surely you're joking's."
However, even those of great wealth know that mere
coercive power is not enough, that you've got to employ
religion, education, culture and social pressure to induce
acceptance that some have it and some don't, and screw those who don't -- keep the Armalite handy. Borrowing from the Catholic Church, John Calvin tweaked this wealth-hoarding philosophy to a high-definition blind faith in predestination: one is born to have it and too bad about the others -- which relieves those who got it by luck and crime (misnamed self-reliant hard work and careful planning) and can't quite find solace in their own self-deception, can't
quite believe their protectors are trustworthy.
Calvinist voodoo in updated guises has been for a couple of centuries the fundamentalist faith of the newly wealthy of the industrial (and now electronic) culture, and economic soothsayers know how to keep the grants, lecture fees and book profits coming by peddling all sorts of new versions especially tailored to fit semi-ignorant, fearful souls unsure how to capitalize on their capital, and terrified that it will evaporate just as inexplicably as it rained down on the very spot they happened to be at while all around them folks
were dying of drought.
None of this applies to the good hearts on this list, who are
amazingly generous of their time to contribute wit and wisdom
and frank admission that what else can one do except
joke about god's folly, endure the drought and pray that the rains come and shit storms don't. As now in southeast Asia.
What an amazing RICO op is Wall Street, now World Street, comparable to RICO government, now world gov, composed
of the same Bosses and Pols working hand in hand to

and socialism are for clueless fools unable to grasp the wonders of highly organized theft to avoid labor (and taxes) altogether, that coercive-capitalist-gov self-delusion unable

Warmaking is ever changing in response to the last wins
and losses. However, winners are less likely to change than losers, for why change a successful formula,
publish it, or a well-spun dissimulation.
As ever, unknown forms of war are in gestation, being
tested and debriefed, in military institutions and
wargames, in business, in education, in the amorphous
culture at large through legal competition and crime
and their variable gray areas where fair and unfair,
civilized rules and their breaking, are ever in grim and vicious dispute.
While there are piles of studies on organized and
guerilla wars of the past, the most provocative are
those that attempt to describe what's coming, how
to recognize its early warnings and what can be done
to head it off or, more likely, advance it.
The highest warmaking art is winning without physical
fighting, to outfox the enemy by demoralizing, by demonstrating that attack is futle, that there is no chance of defeating a superior force. That's why military exhibitionism and psy war is reputed
among military and political leaders to be as vital as that of brute force, as best exemplified by the Cold War 50-year stalemate and psychological "win-win" to
a status of Cool War.
To get a handle on what's in store, imagine that completely unbelievable methods of warfare, overt and covert, are being concocted now, composed of strategies, tactics, warfighters and armaments never before used -- and will not be revealed and understood until too late for defense. Try to forget everything you know about warfighting, crime fighting, conflict resolution, rules of engagement,
black operations, guerilla tactics, hiding among the people. Assume the enemy knows everything you know and
more, is better armed and smarter than you, has more spies among your supporters and in your most intimate Imagine that your toilet, your bed, your fridge, your car, your is triggered to explode by radio or your computer by
your password.
Consider that there will be no time to reflect and reconsider when things go catastrophically wrong and the
enemy is unrelenting attacking with inhuman viciousness, when you're defenses are crumbling and weapons failing,
when mates are squealing, dead or run away, when you can't stop shitting yourself, when your legs are buckling, when your minds racing out of control, when you're begging god
and mom for mercy and the upraised axe is descending, the
barrel back of head is firing.
Remember that who the enemy is is no secret to either side, on whichever side you're on, and presume that the emeny is more ready and able to cook your goose than you are theirs.
What actual war carnage teaches, what the current civil war in the US is showing, is what the TV-sofa war does not: nobody wins, ever, except the mindfuckers who've never gone
berzerk in combat or in the jobplace, killed friend and foe to save own asses.
You only win wars by never having to fight them, those started by weakling cowards unable to steal, cheat and lie well enough to satisfy their demonic lusts.
Best to outsmart the enemy in war, work and love, so that what you're up to is revealed only years later if ever. For
the best won wars are never known at the time, no parades,
no medals, no glory, no war stories, no memorial cemeteries
and monuments, no veteran hospitals filled with carrion, just peace and tranquility shooting deer, harpooning dolpins,
rip-tearing the landscape for profligate cowboy wargames
riding homicidal freeways.
We're all gonna lose our civil war in market place killings and road rage, thanks to today's warfighting lesson in free fire criminal enterprise by those who've never been shot and
shot and shot, and lost for good -- the vainglorious winners,
the losers desperate to regain glory days.

@_subject: Pet Bog Crypto Ban 
As a strategic bank shot for banning domestic use of encryption the US FBI and Fish and Wildlife Service have declared the pet Bog Snatch Algorithm a terrorist threat:
     (134K)
B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes
    The bog turtle is a target for pet collectors due to its rarity in the wild, distinctive coloration, and small size. Take (primarily illegal) both for the national and international commercial pet trade industry has occurred for many years. Collecting is a significant factor in the species decline and is an ongoing threat to its continued existence in the wild (Anon. 1991; Earley 1993; David Flemming, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in litt. 1991; Herman 1990; Klemens in press; Stearns et al. 1990; Tryon 1990; Tryon and Herman 1990). During the last 5 to 10 years, an increasing number of bog turtles have been advertised for sale, and prices have increased substantially. The increase in price most likely reflects the increase in demand for the turtles; the increase in demand increases the threats to the wild populations (Tryon and Herman 1990).
    Atlanta Zoo personnel reported that from 1989 to early 1991, over 1000 bog turtles were exported to Japan. These figures differ significantly from CITES data and represent a significant amount of unreported illegal trade (Anon. 1991). The World Wildlife Fund recently listed bog turtles as among the world's top 10 ``most wanted'' endangered species (Earley 1993). According to Alan Salzburg, President of the American Turtle and Tortoise Society, the bog turtle is considered the most prized turtle in the United States, and when bog turtle locations become publicly known, they are exploited by collectors within 1 year (Laura Hood, Defenders of Wildlife, in litt.     Due to the threats facing bog turtle populations, the Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles adopted a resolution calling for the prohibition of collection from wild populations (Stearns et al. 1990). Due to the small size of existing populations, and the low reproductive and recruitment potential of this species, the removal of even a few breeding adults can do irrevocable damage to a population (Tryon 1990). Collecting has been a factor in the reduction or extirpation of several bog turtle populations in Delaware (Anon. 1991), Maryland (Anon. 1991; Smith, in litt. 1994), Massachusetts (Anon. 1991), New Jersey (Farrell and Zappalorti 1989; Zappalorti, pers. comm. 1994; Zappalorti, in litt. 1997), New York (Breisch, in litt. 1993; Breisch et al., in litt. 1994; Collins 1990; Behler, in litt. 1997), and Pennsylvania (Ralph Pisapia, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in litt. 1992; Zappalorti, in litt. 1997). Many sites in these States have suitable habitat, but have much-reduced bog turtle populations, probably due to collecting.
    Throughout the bog turtle's entire range, States regulate take through classification of the species as endangered (in Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia) or threatened (in Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee), yet trade continues.
    Illegal trade is difficult to detect due to the questionable origin of turtles being offered for sale. Bog turtles are often ``laundered'' through States which either do not have native populations (e.g., West Virginia, Florida, California), or through States which have inadequate protection of their own bog turtle populations (Charles Bepler, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in litt. 1993; Breisch, in litt. 1993; Michael Klemens, in litt. 1990). For example, in recent years dealers have claimed West Virginia as the State of origin for bog turtles; however, there is no evidence to support the contention that the bog turtle occurs in that State (Dennis Herman, Project Bog Turtle Coordinator, in litt. 1997; Tom Thorp, North Carolina Herpetological Society, in litt. 1997). Hatchling and juvenile turtles marketed as ``captive-born'' are usually offspring from gravid adult females illegally brought into captivity and held until they deposit eggs. The eggs are then hatched in captivity, and the captive-born (but not captive-bred) offspring are then marketed or retained (Bepler, in litt.     A few specific instances of illegal bog turtle collecting and trade are reported below:
    (1) An undercover officer purchased eight bog turtles from a person who had collected them near Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Also, two additional bog turtles were recovered from persons who had gotten them from friends allegedly in the New York area (Bepler, in litt. 1993);
    (2) An individual from New Jersey was arrested for bringing bog turtles from New Jersey to Florida and selling them as captive-born. It is suspected that he collected about six turtles per year over a period of several years (Bepler, in litt. 1993);
    (3) A reliable source in New York reported that over 2000 wild-
caught bog turtles were shipped to Japan in a 2-year period (Murdock, in litt. 1990);
    (4) Researchers found several turtle traps and a much-diminished bog turtle population at an important bog turtle site in Pennsylvania (Pisapia, in litt. 1992);
    (5) In 1993, a New Jersey resident purchased 47 bog turtles in Florida, and since 1984 had also bought 20 additional bog turtles. This individual supposedly has an active breeding program for bog turtles (Terry Tarr, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in litt. 1993);
    (6) When confronted in a New York wetland, an individual claiming to be a birdwatcher revealed the contents of the cloth bag he was carrying--a bog turtle and spotted turtle (Paul Novak, New York Natural Heritage Program, in litt. 1990);
    (7) A reliable source reported seeing approximately 60 bog turtles at the Ohio residence of a person who frequents reptile shows. Based on the physical appearance of the bog turtles, they were not captive-bred (Scott Smith, Maryland Department of Natural Resources, in litt. 1996);
    (8) Bog turtles have been available at the major Herpetological Expo in Orlando, Florida for the last 2 years (Herman, in litt. 1997; Thorp, in litt. 1997); and
    (9) Bog turtles were observed in several Florida dealerships in 1996, although they have not been openly advertised for sale (Herman, in litt. 1997).
    The general consensus among bog turtle researchers, nongame biologists, and law enforcement officials is that illegal collecting is occurring at a much greater rate than detected or reported (Anon. 1991; Breisch, in litt. 1993; Flemming, in litt. 1991). Bog turtles are already extremely low in numbers throughout much of their range, and any additional take could eliminate marginal populations and hamper survival and recovery efforts.
    Protecting existing sites for bog turtles can pose a threat when these specific sites are revealed and publicized. In addition to the threat of collection for the pet trade industry, collection of bog
turtles for exhibition at nature centers is also a threat (Anon. 1991).

AT&T, Hewlett Packard, Intel Corporation, Dell Computers, and many other leading computer corporations have been added to the challenge list by Meganet Corporation. The challenge started last week with Bill Gates, now some of his peers have an opportunity to validate or discredit the bold claim that Meganet's VME (Virtual Matrix Encryption) is totally unbreakable. Unbreakable encryption is the only answer to security in our electronic world. This is graphically illustrated by the recent report from the National Security Agency
reporting the open market availability of a $10 chip that can test up to 200 million keys per second. The 56-bit key, government and banking standard, can be compromised in twelve (12) seconds with brute force using ASIC
(Application-specific Integrated Circuits) chips. Meganet has the answer with its new VME (Virtual Matrix Encryption). The impenetrable VME also has extreme speed, much faster than any existing program available today.

[Congressional Record: November 7, 1997 (Senate)]
[Page S11959]
                         ENCRYPTION
  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to associate myself with the comments of the majority leader from October 21, 1997. Senator Lott has correctly highlighted the FBI's constantly shifting arguments and the Bureau's seemingly relentless attempts to grab more power at the expense of the Constitution, particularly the fourth amendment's protection of privacy and the fifth amendment's guarantee of due process.
  The FBI legislative proposal goes far beyond the Commerce Committee's misguided encryption legislation in further disregarding our Constitution. Instead of working with those who understand that S.909 gives the FBI unprecedented and troubling authority to invade lives, the FBI has attempted to grab even broader authority. The Senate would be foolish to pass S.909. In no way can we even consider the ill-advised FBI approach. The reach of the FBI has now extended so far that the President has taken the other side of the issue and supported a free market approach, according to his public comments delivered   I can only conclude that the FBI has introduced its proposal as a ploy to make S.909 look like a reasonable compromise. The only other explanation for the FBI's proposal is that the Bureau will not be satisfied with S.909, but instead will continue to work to erode our Constitutional protections. In fact, the new proposal only draws attention to the many problems of the Commerce Committee language. Neither proposal is acceptable.
  The issue of encryption must be revisited in a real and serious way next year, both at the committee level and in the Senate chamber, to examine the many Constitutional implications of the various proposals. I look forward to working with the Majority Leader and other Senators who have expressed interest in encryption legislation.
  I yield the floor.

NYT obit November 8:
Sidney Darlington, a Bell Labs mathematician who pioneered
the design of electronic circuits and whose formulas helped
launch rockets 300 times without error, died on Oct. 31 at his
home in Exeter, N.H. He was 91.
At Bell Labs, in Murray Hill, N.J., where he headed the mathematics research center, Dr. Darlington was ranked
alongside his colleague Claude Shannon for breakthroughs
in communications networks that foreshadowed the integrated
circuit and in turn computers and modern communications.
Dr. Darlington's discovery of ways to custom-design circuits
using precise mathematical specifications, a speciality now
called network synthesis theory, made him a leading authority
in electronic cirsuits for decades, said Dr. Ernest Kuh, a
former colleague who is now at the University of California
at Berkeley.
Before Dr. Darlington's work, circuits were designed in an
intuitive, ad hoc manner. His advances won him the highest
award in his field, the Medal of Honor of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronic Engineers.
At a chalkborad at Bell labs with three or four other rocket
guidance experts, he would scrawl equations that became
the basis for guiding the Air Force Titan I, the Thor-Delta
and dozens of other rockets.
His rocket guidance formulas could instantly plug in the
information from several sources -- the trajectory designed
to launch a staellite, the data from radar that tracked the
rocket, and the instruments in the rocket itself -- and
could then return a flow of commands to the rocket.
Always a tinkerer, Dr. Darlington in the 1950's spent a
weekend at home playing with a new gadget, the transistor.
Trying to get more gain from an amplifier the size of a kernel
of corn, he found a way to combine two or more transistors
in one chip, an idea that became the Darlington Compound
Chip and pointed the way toward integrated circuits.

Dumb of me to get in the middle of this, but the bloodlust's
Tim's statements are gutsy and right: there's no gain
in self-censoring, shading one's anger to appease
the goons of whatever firepower. (Bob, go to end.)
Most massive firepower can't focus on or hit exclusively
small targets, that's what's a lie about "surgical" strikes. Waste the countryside, yes, hit one rabbit and not the
beloved dog and fellow hunter, little chance. What it
takes is sharpshooting: a one shot, one target, one
pig, one sticker.
True, Horushi's snipe worked, it nailed an innocent, though
a couple of others died to set him up for his own nailing.
True, Waco worked, it charred a crowd of innocents, though a
few others got plugged setting up the roast, and the 2nd roast.
True, firebombing works, as does mass weaponing --nukes, chemicals and germs -- but indiscriminately, by terrorism
of the masses, at the price of also terrifying the citizenry paying for the megadeath heritage.
All standoff firepower is limited against the individual by imprecision of the killing machines and cowardice of the
operators -- artillery, planes, ships, satellites, take your
pick. They savage territory to save the operator's ass,
who, as anyone knows who been around these candyass
strutters, aint got what it takes to cut the guy's throat
who's stabbing your eye.
What's my point? Well, for lack of a better word, it's personal
courage, going nuts when the time's right, the guts to not shut the fuck up when you're told to by those who're a whole lot bigger, who've got more armaments and thinks they're smarter and more ruthless and meaner and have the troops, rank and medals to back it up. Just remember that most of those strengths are for getting somebody else or a machine to do what is too fucking terrifying to do yourself directly.
Do this when the monster accosts: pull your forelock, say sorry sir, then upstab the fucker's groin, as he doubles, hack the cord, he'll go down quivering, then cut out his liver, kick up his green face, squat close, show him the blob, take a bite, chew, savor, swallow, put lip to dying ear, whisper, "tasty."
Go home, get a beer, stare the tube, sharpen your tool. Or as
maddog Tim sez, lock and load.
But look, I'm with Bob, too, my tool's philosophy gone berzerk,
trash words, wags, gags, alliterations, mouth shooting. My steel weapons are locked from burglars who scare the shit out of me just
by looking like ordinarily ugly wall streeters, that is, like my maddog neighbors eyeing me for junk IPO sales.
Sure glad my war's long over, happily getting dimmer, easier to forget
the godawful. Hey, it's veteran's day, anybody want to croak and limp to glories past?

Federal Register, November 10, 1997
Excerpt from a Federal Reserve Bank announcement:
      ... the Reserve Banks plan to change their policy for ownership of the encryption boards used by depository institutions with dial and multi-drop connections. These encryption boards are currently purchased and owned by the depository institutions. With the replacement of the encryption boards beginning in the second half of 1998 to enhance the security of the Federal Reserve's communications network, the Reserve Banks plan to purchase and assume ownership of these boards. This approach is consistent with Reserve Bank ownership of other equipment at depository institutions that is required for electronic connections to the Federal Reserve, specifically link encryptors and signaling equipment. Reserve Bank ownership should improve management of the security of the network and facilitate the implementation of an all-electronic key distribution system. This change in policy may affect future-year electronic connection fees, as priced services must recover depreciation costs associated with the new encryption boards.
Are these systems related to Kawika Daguio's comments on
PCCIP forwarded by Declan yesterday? Anyone have more
detailed info on the boards and link encryptors?

             But the most likely problems -- there are a couple little babies in this audience, or there were today, and some children -- the most likely problems these children will face when they come of age will be problems that cross national borders -- terrorism, organized crime and drug running, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological weapons and maybe small-scale nuclear weapons.
             This much nuclear cake put in a bomb would do ten times as much damage as the Oklahoma City bomb did.               The spread of environmental problems or diseases across national lines -- we are going to have to, in other words, find ways to cooperate, to keep the organized forces of destruction that are taking advantage of the Internet, the technological revolution, the freedom of travel and the freedom of movement, access to computers and moving money around and all that -- there will always be organized forces of destruction.               That is fundamentally what is at stake in the stand off we're having in Iraq today.  I don't want you to look at this backward through the prism of the Gulf War and think it's a replay.  I want you to look at it forward and think about it in terms of the innocent Japanese people that died in the subway when the saran gas was released; and how important it is for every responsible government in the world to do everything that can possibly be done not to let big stores of chemical or biological weapons fall into the wrong hands, not to let irresponsible people develop the capacity to put them in warheads on missiles or put them in briefcases that could be exploded in small rooms.               And I say this not to frighten you.  The world will always have challenges.  I think the chances are quite good that we can organize ourselves for this challenge and deal with it very effectively.  I personally believe that the next 50 years will be far more peaceful and less dangerous for our children and our grandchildren than the last 50 years were.  I also believe they will be the most prosperous and interesting time in all of human history -- but only if we do the right things.

Wall Street Journal, November 17, 1997, p. 28
   Congress Asked To Help Speed Internet Growth    High-Tech Firms Propose Controls to Build Trust In Digital
   Marketplace    By John Simons
   Washington - In an attempt to assert their newfound clout
   along the Potomac, 11 major U.S. high-technology companies
   are asking Congress and the White House to speed the growth
   of electronic commerce.
   Among the things they want are a moratorium on Internet
   taxes, the addition of Internet-specific language to the
   Uniform Commercial Code and a loosening of
   encryption-export controls.
   In an 18-page policy paper, to be released tomorrow, the
   chief executives of companies including Compaq Computer
   Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co.,
   International Business Machines Corp., and Sun Microsystems
   Inc. outline their recommendations on several prickly
   issues, including sales taxes and tariffs, encryption,
   consumer privacy and content regulation. The coalition,
   also known as the Computer Systems Policy Project, urges
   governments to act quickly to help cyber-merchants foster
   consumer trust in the emerging digital marketplace. Most of
   the companies that endorsed the proposals are poised to
   take advantage of what could be a $200 billion-plus sales
   arena by the year 2000.
   Other companies in the coalition include Apple Computer
   Inc., Data General Corp., NCR Corp., Silicon Graphics Inc.,
   Stratus Computer Inc. and Unisys Corp.
   Although the policy recommendations are another example of
   Silicon Valley's current hot and heavy relationship with
   the nation's capital, the paper is hardly a love letter.
   One familiar refrain: Though industry needs government's
   help, Washington should keep its presence to a minimum.
   There is even a sense that some of the CEOs are reluctant
   to sully themselves by becoming overly involved in matters
   of politics.
   "I have no specific interest in lobbying in the strict
   sense," says Lars Nyberg, the CEO of NCR, co-chairman of
   the authoring committee with IBM's Louis V. Gerstner Jr.
   "Politicians can help this change or they can slow the
   evolution dramatically. We have the responsibility to make
   sure that doesn't happen. So, this is just something we
   have to do."
   The paper's authors are perhaps at their least subtle where
   they chide the Federal Communications Commission for what
   they believe is a plodding and shoddy implementation of the
   Telecommunications Act of 1996. The group argues that in
   order to populate the new digital domain, consumers need
   inexpensive, readily available access to an array of
   telecommunications services.
   Coalition members are concerned about the lack of
   competition in local telephone markets. They insist that
   local monopolies have hampered technological progress.
   "Until there is competition in the local markets for data
   and digital traffic, there will be no pressure on the
   incumbent telephone carriers to deploy new technologies."
   the group states.
   On the tax issue, the CEOs advocate "tax neutrality,"
   meaning that no tax system should discriminate based on the
   way a consumer purchases a product. Uncoordinated attempts
   to "force fit" existing tax structures, for example, "could
   impose discriminatory and multiple taxes on e-commerce
   transactions." they say. To avoid the problem, the group
   prods Congress to pass pending legislation to put a
   moratorium on new Internet sales taxes while industry,
   federal and local governments worked out a national
   standard for levying taxes on Internet commerce. The
   paper's authors are also pushing for a comparable
   international moratorium.
   As for the Internet's legal framework, the paper calls for
   an immediate amendment to the Uniform Commercial Code, one
   that updates contract laws and consumer protection rules
   for on-line transactions.
   The paper is most vague in its prescriptions for encryption
   policy, an area where government and industry have clashed
   on numerous occasions. The U.S. has held tight restrictions
   on the export of strong encryption software, which can be
   used to ensure security for Internet transactions,
   contending that it would be impossible to protect citizens
   from hacker attacks and other digital misdeeds if strong
   encryption were  made available overseas. The coalition is
   critical of the administration's stance, but offers few
   specific solutions.
   In part, the paper is a response to a challenge the White
   House issued last summer. In July, the Clinton
   administration released its "Framework for Global
   Electronic Commerce," a far-reaching set of policy
   prescriptions authored by Ira Magaziner, the president's
   senior adviser on policy development. Throughout the paper,
   Mr. Magaziner stressed that government should take a
   passive role in regulating the Internet. His preferred
   alternative: Help industry to set its own rules and standards.
   Mr. Magaziner called the coalition's paper "a very
   interesting, useful and helpful initiative." He said, "The
   principles are consistent with what we're hoping for. And,
   what's important is they are stepping up and leading."
   Convincing Congress, much less foreign entities, to agree
   on these issues will be difficult, however. Over the next
   few weeks, members of the coalition plan to travel overseas
   with their message. The group expects to meet with members
   of Congress, White House advisers and FCC officials
   sometime in January.

[Congressional Record: November 13, 1997 (Extensions)]
                  ON LIFTING THE ENCRYPTION EXPORT BAN
                                 ______
                            HON. ADAM SMITH
                             of washington
                    in the house of representatives
                      Thursday, November 13, 1997
  Mr. ADAM SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak
about an issue that is very important to me--lifting unfair export
controls on encryption technology.
  Mr. Speaker, protecting our National Security interests is among my
highest priorities. If I thought controlling encryption exports worked
toward this end, I would be its strongest proponent. Unfortunately,
export controls on encryption software simply disadvantage the United
States software industry.
  Under current law the United States allows only 40 bit encryption
codes to be exported, although software companies sell encryption codes
of up to 128 bits everywhere in the United States. Forty bit encryption
technology is so elementary, it took a graduate student a mere 3\1/2\
hours to break a code last January. Fifty-six bit encryption is 65,000
times more difficult to decode than 10 bit encryption and it only took
students three months to break the encryption code. One hundred twenty
eight bit encryption has not been broken yet.
  Naturally, foreign companies do not want to buy 40 bit encryption
software, because it is so vulnerable and insecure. The possibilities
for ``computer hackers'' to break into the system and wreak havoc are
enormous and dangerous. Therefore, foreign companies are purchasing
high-level encryption from foreign software providers instead of
American ones.
  The international demand for encryption software is growing
exponentially because of the tremendous rise in electronic commerce.
For instance, German Economics Minister, Guenter Rexrodt, said, ``Users
can only protect themselves against having data manipulated, destroyed,
or spied on by strong encryption procedures * * *. That is why we have
to use all of our powers to promote such procedures instead of blocking
  Our export restraint has not kept the technology from proliferating.
It has merely allowed foreign producers of strong encryption technology
to fill the vacuum. In fact, American companies are partnering with
foreign firms to distribute their software--taking jobs and revenue
with them.
  American-owned Sun Computers has recently joined with a Russian
software company to avoid the U.S. export ban and sell to foreign
markets. Foreign companies can also purchase American-produced 40 bit
encryption technology and upgrade it in their own countries to 128 bit
encryption technology. This ``add-on'' industry is among the fastest
growing software industries in Europe today. Clearly, if someone wants
high-level encryption technology, he or she can easily obtain it.
  The ability to obtain both powerful and affordable encryption will
now become easier with recent developments in Canada. The Canadian
Government includes encryption software in decontrolling mass market
software under the Generic Software Note. This means any software sold
over-the-counter, by mail or on the phone may be exported without
limits. Entrust, a Canadian software company, is freely marketing and
selling internationally a 128 bit encryption program right now. It
sells for less than $50, and Entrust provides a version of the
encryption technology free on the Internet. Even our most steadfast
ally sees that export controls can no longer help stem the overwhelming
demand and spread of unbreakable encryption.
  Mr. Speaker, if the United States continues to impose these
restrictive export bans on its own companies, ``foreign competition
could emerge at a level significant enough to damage the present U.S.
world leadership'' in the software industry, according to the National
Research Council's blue-ribbon panel on encryption policy. If our
export ban continues, the United States will not be the worldwide
leader on encryption technology for long, and that would be a true risk
to our national security.
  I strongly oppose any unilateral sanctions or regulations that put
the United States at an unnecessary disadvantage. Our current export
ban on encryption software is a perfect example, and I intend to
continue the fight to change our policy and allow the United States to
compete in the global software market.

To amplify this a bit: the explanation also included the
speculation of cascading fuel being ignited from the
bottom and flaming upward, which could be interpreted by the observers as a missile rising. An interesting view which I wonder if any of our scientists
here find credible. Perhaps I missed it, but I don't recall the CIA video showing
upward flaming fuel, rather it showed a billowing explosion
centered on the main fuel tank of the upturning fuselage
(as the front cabin plummeted).
Is it feasible that the fuel would ignite and flame upward that way or would it be too broadly dispersed by speed and the atmosphere to cause a coherent, shaped flame such as that of a missile tail? For example, would an adept pilot be able to tell the difference?
This is posed because of the way several theories of
the OKC blomb blast got it wrong due to overly
narrow initial interpretation as did misinterpretations
of other controversial "terrorisms."
Perhaps Tim May is correct in his assessment of Jim,
but NTSC's upcoming hearing should produce more reliable technical information than Kallstrom appears to be comfortable handling -- given his bent for melodrama fine details of investigation seem to be an annoyance,
although he appeared to like the assurance of the CIA's virtual reality.
Kallstrom also said that the case will remain open, I guess
in case Boeing or TWA or something needs to be zapped
by blind justice.

@_subject: Your Papers, Please 
Network World, November 15, 1997:
 Welcome To Cyberspace. Your Papers Please?  About a year ago, the Treasury Department issued a little-noticed discussion  document entitled "Selected Tax Policy Implications of Global Electronic  Commerce" ( Beavering away in obscurity, these unelected  technocrats have almost finished turning the broad "implications" into
detailed  regulations. Like most tax rulings, these regulations require no further  congressional action to have the force of law. So, while rehabilitated Clinton  apparatchik Ira Magaziner was out mesmerizing the digerati with his  "Framework for Global Electronic Commerce," promising free markets and no new  taxes, the green-eyeshade boys were quietly laying the groundwork to launch
the  IRS into cyberspace. ...
 The classic strategy of forcing reporting requirements on key "taxing
points," such
 as banks, clearinghouses and other financial institutions, is not likely to
work as
 the need for intermediation on the Internet will be vastly reduced. In many
 that's the whole point of electronic commerce. Any reporting burdens must be
 pushed out to the end points of each transaction. How will this be done?
This is
 where Big Brother may arrive big time.  Under active consideration is a plan to require taxpayers to obtain digital
IDs for all
 electronic transactions, keeping records that could be examined on audit.
The IDs
 would be issued by IRS certified agencies, subject to government developed

Jim Bell was scheduled to be sentenced today at 9:30 AM.
I called the court's ever-helpful administrative office (1-253-593-6754) for a report and was told that sentencing had been postponed until December 12, 10:30AM.
Other info:
Mail sent to Jim (not by me) since his request for books has been returned twice that I know about
Books sent to Kitsap County jail, where he was first incarcerated,
was returned marked "Not in Jail." After this an inquiry to the court was made about Jim's location (not by me) and it was learned that he had been
transferred to Federal Detention Center at SeaTac, WA.
A letter sent there recently was returned unopened, marked "Return to Writer."
The court docket today at 8:00PM does not list his relocation nor the new sentencing date. However, entries usually appear
a day or so after an action:
   Perhaps one of our legal subscribers could comment on what's
going on with these repeated delays in sentencing, especially
whether it's common to do so after a plea agreement is reached.
Now, scuttlebutt: a person at a Seattle legal document service
told me today that another case is coming up similar to Jim's
that also alleges "intimidation of IRS officials." Whether that
relates to delays in Jim's case is a mystery inside an enigma.

To buttress suggestions for simulating the OKC bombing, here's an SAIC press release of August 1997 on a training program for disaster handling:
SAIC AND TEEX TO PROVIDE ANTI-TERRORISM TRAINING TO FIRST RESPONDERS (MCLEAN, VA) Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) has signed an agreement with the Texas Engineering Extension Service (TEEX) to prepare civilian emergency responders for possible terrorist events. Under the agreement, SAIC and its teaming partners will provide training to firefighters and other first response personnel in the latest technologies for addressing chemical and biological terrorism. As the leader of the team, TEEX will hold training classes at Texas A&M University's Emergency Response Training Field at College Station, Texas, where firefighters and rescue workers will train in virtual reality simulators on the effects of chemical and biological weapons. TEEX, which is a member of the Texas A&M University System, annually provides training to 129,000 individuals and last year provided fire, rescue and hazardous materials training nationally and internationally to more than 28,000
responders. "The United States has been fortunate in that it has not had a successful terrorist attack perpetrated against it using biological or chemical agents," said G. Kemble Bennett, TEEX's CEO who oversees the 120-acre Brayton Fire Training Field. "However, experts agree that it is only a matter of time." "As a leader in chemical and biological warfare agent accident, response and assistance training for military and civilian emergency response agencies, SAIC can offer expert guidance to responders," said William L. Chadsey, senior vice president at SAIC. "Our company has provided emergency planning and consultative services to personnel and public service organizations worldwide." In September, U.S. Representative Curt Weldon (R-Pa.) is expected to introduce a bill in Congress to designate the training field at Texas A&M and its facilities as The National Training Center for Urban Search and Rescue. The new center is expected to feature building collapse simulators and a facility dubbed "Disaster City" to prepare responders to handle earthquakes and bombings in addition to chemical and biological agents. If approved, Rep. Weldon¹s bill also is likely to facilitate the release of information from Bechtel Nevada at the Nevada Test Site about the handling of nuclear materials. Speaking at the signing ceremony, Fire Chief Gary Marrs of Oklahoma City, Okla., said, "The first responders in our communities, and specifically our firefighters, are tasked to respond and make a difference when disasters occur. Until the training and equipment,
utilizing the latest in technology, get down to the street level, we put our responders at an extreme disadvantage and endanger their lives. I am encouraged to see these types of cooperative efforts make this training and technology available to the men and women of the fire service who protect our cities daily." Marrs, who managed the fire and rescue mission at the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, chairs the Urban Search and Rescue Committee for the International Association of Fire Chiefs located in Fairfax, Va.

2. Jim is not fully cooperating, say, refusing to name others or provide

4. Jim's drawing out cooperation, negotiating for a better deal, perhaps

5. Jim is faking it, convincingly, sending the feds off on wild goose chases, working with confederates on preplanned ruses.

   An excerpt:
  In a hearing in U.S. District Court in Tacoma this morning,   Bell 's public defender and an assistant U.S. Attorney recommended   a 6-to-12-month jail sentence for Bell as part of a plea-bargain   agreement.
  But federal probation officers recommended a sentence of 27 months.   In doing so, they said they were looking at the "totality" of Bell's   behavior, including the threatening nature of his Internet essay,   "Assassination Politics."   As a result, U.S. District Court Judge Franklin D. Burgess said he   was uncomfortable with the situation. "Somehow I am getting a feeling   that somebody knows more about something than I do," Burgess said.
Also reported: Jim had encrypted some of his files. And though "Bell
plead guilty to relatively innocuous charges" IRS investigators
compared him to The Unabomber and Tim McVeigh, and claimed he
was "part of a far darker scheme to assassinate IRS agents and topple the   U.S. government."

In that direct or indirect defense funding implicates just about every

This is not to say that that's the way it should be, just that defense
funding has been the deep pocket for nearly every commonweal
at least since WW II. And the same for the future appears to hold true as every federal
state and local government eagerly calibrate their demands for urgent aid according to national and economic security guidelines -- dual use brought into the open as heretofore hidden by duplicity.
Under national security programs DoD has funded through its pervasive tentacles scientists and mathematicians, libertarians and socialists, elite and trailer trash, Wall Street and underworld, on and on. Not a chance of stopping it any time soon.
It is doubtful that any other more bountiful and widespread source of condoned bribery has ever existed, and it shows no sign of
slackening, in the US or elsewhere, whether democracies, oligarchies, communist, or offshore outlaw, even allowing for the burgeoning private
armies, cops, gun faith forces, each loading up with new and "surplus"

seems to be bothered by it, except to comlain that others are getting

The National Defense Panel presented yesterday to the Secretary of Defense its 95-page report on the future of US defense:    "Transforming Defense: National Security in the 21st Century."
It's available in PDF format at:
     (386K)
The report proposes an impressive 30-year overhaul for the military, with a recommendation that the two-major-wars strategy be replaced with that of preparing for one major war and a host of more limited defenses overseas and at home to combat enemies who will not challenge superior conventional armaments but will utilize "asymmetrical" NBC weapons, terrorism, information We've converted the Executive Summary to HTML:
   And a section on "Homeland Defense" which proposes a role for military forces to "protect against all enemies foreign and domestic" by providing intelligence, training, equipment and other aid to justice and law enforcement.
   As noted in the NYT today, the report asks for a shakeup in
intelligence, with renewed emphasis on training human spies
to compensate for what technology cannot do.
Along that line, the NYT also reports today on a huge Libyan
deeply-buried pipeline system under construction which is suspected of being a distribution system for troops and equipment as well as CB weapons, placed underground to escape satellite
spies. The report is based on descriptions of engineers and
corporations working on the project.
One feature of the NDP report, as well as other closed defense
panel meetings, is the need for weapons to attack underground
structures -- like those vast catcombs in Lybia and North Korea,
and the US for that matter -- Cheyenne Mountain is still being
re-hardened regularly, and its electronics re-Tempested, not that the local skinheads will not find a way to hack the bunker as trusted EEs and sys admins.

Hackers Out for IP Blood with New Land Attack  The Internet underworld last week unsheathed a new weapon  capable of knocking out IP-based routers and servers, sending  vendors scrambling to find ways to safeguard their gear.  Land Attack, officially known as land.c program code, was posted  on the Net by someone called "Meltman" and used last week in  attacks on Cisco Systems, Inc. routers and Unix and Windows  NT servers. Some of the targeted machines were slowed to a  crawl, while others had to be rebooted.  Land Attack represents a new twist on the dreaded "TCP SYN  flooding" denial-of-service attack.  But unlike TCP SYN flooding, Land Attack sends out just one  sinister SYN packet in which the sending devices IP address has  been swapped out for the IP address of the destination machine.  When the destination machine tries to acknowledge receipt of the  transmission, it ends up using its own address, which means it
 sends the message back to itself, resulting in a potentially fatal
 loopback condition. "If someone could find a way to use this  Land Attack program to spread this across the Internet, it could  cause major service disruptions," said Chris Klaus, chief

 Right to Privacy for Sale in Cyberspace; SynData Technologies Inc. Speaks Out  Against Key Recovery
 Cedar Grove, N.J. -- SynData Technologies Inc., a provider of encryption
software  solutions, released a statement today condemning Network Associates Inc., the  market leader for virus protection software products, for supporting the
government's  key recovery program. Network Associates Inc., formerly known as McAfee
Associates Inc.,
 recently purchased Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) for $36 million, an encryption
 software provider. PGP had historically been opposed to key recovery.  "It is time to seriously consider the threat that Network Associates poses
to the
 individual's constitutional right to privacy," said David Romanoff, CEO of

 revenues overseas by supporting the key recovery program. The slippery slope
 has begun right under our noses. It's time to challenge both the government and
 companies who support the government's key recovery program before it is too
 late."  The United States Commerce Department does not allow US encryption software
 makers to export strong encryption without a key recovery program. Companies
 who do not believe in the government's key recovery program are forced to
 develop both export and domestic versions of their software, each with a
 strength.  "The government's key recovery program is a complete violation of the
 individual's right to privacy and, in fact, compromises of the system are
 taking place. This shows that key escrow is an untenable policy," said Bruce
 Schneier, one of the world's leading authorities on encryption and author
of the
 book "Applied Cryptography". "SynData is paving the way for other software
 developers by taking a stand in opposition to the government and companies like
 Network Associates."  SynData Technologies does not believe in key recovery or other government
 involvement in the regulation of the encryption software industry. The company
 also believes that the current export curbs on encryption put the entire
industry at
 a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, these policies undermine the
security of
 the global marketplace and put the individual's right to privacy at risk.  SynData Technologies Inc., based in Cedar Grove, New Jersey, unveiled their
 flagship encryption software product, SynCrypt, in September of this year.
 SynCrypt is available directly from SynData Technologies, 800-499-1469, and

If not, what seems to be the most reasonable explanation for
Phil not answering, to allay suspicions and sustain PGP's
worldwide reputation? The explanations by others working
with PGP, Inc. would surely be more credible if Phil expressed public support for their views.
I still find it hard to accept that Phil would squander his personal
reputation, and thereby the reputation of his invention, by
refusing to provide a public accounting of what's happening
with PGP Inc. And, no matter the legal and financial restrictions
that might be contraining him. And no matter that PGP's
competitors are probably encouraging some of the attacks.
Security by obscurity, by indifference to public doubts, seems
to be a surefire way to undermine Phil's years long struggle
to distinguish himself from those less courageous than him
who are pushing products less reliable than PGP has been
believed to be until now.
It's a haunting thought to consider that Phil may have been
shown evidence by others that PGP is not as reliable as many have long believed, evidence that perhaps demonstrates what
he knew all along. This is harsh suspicion and one that needs
his response, if for no other reason to allay the fear that even
prior versions of PGP are now suspect.
PGP and Phil's personal reputation are at stake, not PGP, Inc., which is secondary. There are lots of folks whose freedom, if not lives, may be at risk due to his silence.
Perhaps it's time for Phil to reaffirm that difficult choice between success and conviction, between making a killing and betraying others to do so. To remind those who think you can have both ways and get away with it is a cowardly fantasy too often hidden behind self-serving ethics.
If Phil personally (not the PGP officer, not the distinguished scientist
bullshit role, not the PGP employees) refuses to stand behind PGP as it has been known and trusted, then PGP and Phil should be denounced forever as a grand deception and treachery, even worse than the other crypto products eagerly shaped -- and openly proud of it -- to fit the specs of the paymaster snoops Phil himself once bravely challenged.
I think Phil will come through now, as he has in the past, to distinguish
himself and PGP (not Inc.) from the craven pack.
If he doesn't, it's smart to give up using PGP in all its guises past and

                years supervised release, fine                              The Associated Press
                           12/12/97 7:54 PM Eastern
             TACOMA (AP) -- A federal judge Friday imposed an 11-month
             sentence for tax violations on James Dalton Bell, whose 10-part
             Internet essay, "Assassination Politics," proposed apparent
             "bounties" on government officials.              Federal prosecutors say he was advocating bounties on public
             officials he considered "miscreants" and "slimeballs." Bell has
             he was theorizing, not advocating any killing.              The Vancouver, Wash., man pleaded guilty in July to trying to
             impede Internal Revenue Service agents and to using false Social
             Security numbers to hide his assets.              After his prison term, U.S. District Judge Franklin Burgess
             ordered Bell to undergo three years of supervised release. He also
             was ordered to pay $1,359 in restitution for damage caused by a
             stink bomb he set off at the IRS's Vancouver office.              Bell's essay was cited in the indictment as a means by which he
             sought to intimidate IRS agents, Assistant U.S. Attorney Annmarie
             Levins said.              A news release from federal prosecutors says that as part of his
             plea agreement, Bell "admitted advocating a scheme called
             `Assassination Politics' whereby persons would be rewarded with
             `digital cash' through the Internet for killing undesirable
people.              "Bell identified government employees, particularly IRS
             employees, as such undesirable people, and argued that the threat
             of `Assassination Politics' would intimidate them from enforcing
             Internal Revenue laws for fear of being assassinated."              He also admitted proposing "Assassination Politics" as an
             enforcement mechanism for the anti-government Oregon extremist
             group Multnomah County Common Law Court, which purports to
             try government officials for performance of their duties, the
             release said.              Prosecutors and Bell's public defender sought a sentence of 6 to
             12 months as part of a plea bargain. Federal probation officers
             recommended 27 months, citing the "totality" of Bell's behavior.              Bell described "Assassination Politics" as a means for ordinary
             citizens to take action against public officials they perceived as
             having violated their rights.              "What if they could go to their computers, type in the miscreant's
             name and select a dollar amount. The amount they, themselves,
             would be willing to pay to anyone who `predicts' that
             officeholder's death," he wrote.              "That donation would be sent, encrypted and anonymously, to a
             central registry organization and be totaled, with the total amount
             available within seconds to any interested individual."              He noted that if one person in 1,000 "was willing to pay $1 to see
             some government slimeball dead, that would be, in effect, a
             $250,000 bounty on his head."              In an April raid on the home Bell shared with his elderly parents,
             authorities found the home addresses of about 70 IRS employees,
             as well as three semiautomatic assault rifes, a handgun and
             potentially deadly chemicals. He was arrested in May.

The United States Sentencing Commission published in the Federal Register today an RFC on changes in sentencing guidelines. Here's an excerpt on electronic copyright . . .
Legislative Amendments
Electronic Copyright Infringement
9. Issue for Comment
    The No Electronic Theft Act, Public Law 105-147, was recently enacted to provide a statutory basis to prosecute and punish persons who, without authorization and without realizing financial gain or commercial advantage, electronically access copyrighted materials or encourage others to do so. The Act includes a directive to the Commission to (A) ensure that the applicable guideline range for a crime committed against intellectual property (including offenses set forth at section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code, and sections 2319, 2319A, and 2320 of title 18, United States Code) is sufficiently stringent to deter such a crime; and (B) ensure that the guidelines provide for consideration of the retail value and quantity of the items with respect to which the crime against intellectual property was     Each of the statutes mentioned in the congressional directive currently are referenced to Sec. 2B5.3 (Criminal Infringement of Copyright or Trademark). That guideline provides for incrementally greater punishment when the retail value of the infringing items exceeded $2,000. However, when copyrighted materials are infringed upon by electronic means, there is no ``infringing item'', as would be the case with counterfeited goods. Therefore, the Commission must determine how to value the infringed upon items in order to implement the congressional directive to take into account the retail value and quantity of the items with respect to which the offense was
committed. The Commission invites comment on how Sec. 2B5.3 (Criminal Infringement of Copyright or Trademark) should be amended to best effectuate the congressional directives.
    An approach suggested by the Department of Justice is set forth below. The Commission invites comment on this and alternative     Department of Justice Proposed Amendments to Sec. 2B5.3:
    The text of Sec. 2B5.3 is amended to read as follows: ``(a) Base offense level: [6]
    (b) Specific Offense Characteristic
    (1) If the loss to the copyright or trademark exceeded $2,000, increase by the corresponding number of levels from the table in Sec. 2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit).''.
    The Commentary to Sec. 2B5.3 captioned ``Application Note'' is amended in Note 1 by striking:
    `` `Infringing items' means the items that violate the copyright or trademark laws (not the legitimate items that are infringed upon).'',
and inserting:
    ``A court may calculate the `loss to the copyright or trademark owner' in any reasonable manner. In determining `loss to the copyright or trademark owner,' the court may consider lost profits, the value of the infringed upon items, the value of the infringing items, the injury to the copyright or trademark owner's reputation, and other associated     The Commentary to Sec. 2B5.3 captioned ``Application Note'' is amended by striking ``Note'' and inserting ``Notes''; and by adding at the end the following new note:
    ``2. In some cases, the calculable loss to the victim understates the true harm caused by the offense. For example, a defendant may post copyrighted material to an electronic bulletin board or similar online facility, making it easy for others to illegally obtain and further distribute the material. In such an instance, it may not be possible to determine or even estimate how many copies were downloaded, or how much damage the defendant's conduct ultimately caused. In such cases, an upward departure may be warranted. See Chapter Five, Part K     The Commentary to Sec. 2B5.3 captioned ``Background'' is amended in the first paragraph by striking ``value of the infringing items'' and inserting ``loss to the copyright or trademark owner''; and by striking ``loss or''.

A clue to what's coming: BXA is due to issue its regulations for
implementing the Wassenaar Arrangement about January 26, so wrote
Jim Lewis at the agency. (Most here know that Wassenaar is
an international agreement among thirty-plus nations to control
export of technology, including encryption.)
Other nations who have signed Wassenaar will probably follow suit, preceded already by Australia and maybe others. Scuttlebutt is that
they're awaiting the US giant's move (or dealing for better incentives).
Further, there's surely preparatory work going on for crypto legislation
in the upcoming session, and we may see a push early in the term
in concert with Wassenaar and perhaps other Net regulations stimulated
by fear of infrastructure terrorism.
What's worth pondering is what new arguments will be made for
controlling/decontrolling crypto, new ways to divide the baby so every interest group can have a chunk, new serendipitous incidents, accidents and incentives.
Recall Bill Renisch's comment that nothing has ever boosted
interest in BXA-who like encryption, as several legislators and
other who's-thats in and out of gov have discovered. Any
topic that generates public attention is not to be ignored for long.
Along parallel lines, The New Yorker mag of January 12 has two
stories of note:
A short one on how blame the militants for the OKC bombing
so powerfully argued before the trials of McVeigh and Nichols
was not pursured during the trials. It suggests an apology to
militants is in order for groundless accusations.
Another much longer on the economic theory behind Justice's attack on Microsoft and how it challenges free market theory,
especially for high technology. That government intervention
may be needed for the pervasive dependency of society on such technology because it has such vast potential for harm. A curious parallel to the argument for Wassenaar.

DM notes of the BXA Wassenaar rule for voice coding:
   After looking at some of the Wassenaar docs, I was
   surprised to see that the CCL wants to regulate speech
   encoders that operate at less than 2400 bps. Surprising
   because it was encoding, not encryption, that was being
   regulated. This is disturbing.
   This at first seemed to put some of the Nautilus development
   team's software in jeopardy, but I believe that by the letter
   of the law (or regulation) that all coders in Nautilus are not
   subject to the CCL, as they only go as low as 2400 bps
   and not less than.

@_subject: CAD Stego 
This repeats a suggestion from 1994 about using computer
assisted design programs to conceal text or other data:
1. CAD uses vectors to make graphics, including text,
and most programs can import a wide variety of data from other formats.
2. Several features can manipulate CAD objects into
unrecognizable forms by modifying scale, dimension,
orientation, opacity and so on.
3. The scale feature is useful to reduce, say, a text
of any length, or any digital object, to the size of a pixel. This pixel can be located, say, under a visible line, or, be made transparent as a "phantom" object. (An engineer
"stipples" concrete with microdot exotica and lofts the docs
to the Saudis, getting paid ten times the regular fee.)
4. Or, the text can be distorted by scale and dimension
to appear to be a line serving another function.
5. It's a snap to encrypt the text and import
it into CAD via several programs that do that duty.
Then the message could be distorted or hidden as
described above, for piggy-backing on an innocent-
looking document issued, say, to GSA for replenishing
the Blanco Bunker, where it would be opened by the
cp insider-sou-chef for de-distorted, decrypted instructions on how to prepare and place the bean.
6. To be sure, the underlying CAD code of the ciphertext could be identified by an astute auto-message-vetter of the EOP and then the CADbreakers would be beckoned to the roachtrap.
7. Big shortcoming: how to securely transmit the location (virtual coordinates) of the hidden message and what modifications need to be reversed for message access.
Beware of using 0,0,0 -- a near-universal data point for
CAD docs. However, 0,0,2^50 miles might be overlooked
if the 3d view is disabled.
8. Medium shortcoming: Full-featured CAD programs are expensive, however, the popular lite versions are cheap
and can usually read the pricier output.

Printed ads are sometimes not archived as widely as news articles, due
to the cost of reproduction, distribution and storage.
The same is true, though, of personals and other types of throwaways.
One possibility is to buy an ad on the NYT Front Page which is often sent
as an image around the world separately from the full paper, and on which one can buy a tiny ad for about $800 for two lines of text 32 characters long (ID must be included). That's the rate for a one-timer.

Why the focus on color, the easiest thing to avoid using,

Most messages could be concealed in "hatched" objects,
bit-bloated as they are, indistinguishable from the elements
used to hatch. All black and white; maybe a dot of red for

In fact, CAD is so bloated with dumb cad-jockey features,
and sleazebag work-monitoring logs, it puts most ordinary programs (even air-boss MS) to shame, and could hide a herd of rustled Mex longhorns as easily as the Bush family hides dryhole oil reserves, without any more trickery than sandpapering new boots to look worn.

Bill Stewart compared the PR of RPK New Zealand's crypto
to Peter Gutmann's claims for NZ export controls.
This contrast confirms the report a few days back that any commercial crypto product that receives export approval from
any country is probably compromised notwithstanding the manufacturer's claims otherwise. Not that it's news here, but
this appears to be the unpublished requirement for granting of approvals, case by case. Either cooperate or face indefinite As Peter noted some time ago, this is what he was running into when he could not get a clear answer about NZ regulations, and parallels reports of similar experiences in the US, UK and other countries.
There is a similar current thread on UK Crypto about the difficulty
of getting a straight answer about crypto policy from HMG while
observing the success of cooperating crypto manufacturers.
It will be interesting to see how hard Congress pushes in the new session to expose what the Administration is up to behind BXA's

On "using honey not vinegar" rationale of RPK InvisiMail for
obtaining crypto export licenses:
Applied Cryptography, Bruce Schneier, 2nd Edition, pp. 215-16
Algorithms for Export
Algorithms for export out of the United States must be approved by the U.S. government (actually, by the NSA--see Section 25.1)
It is widely believed that these export-approved algorithms can be broken by the NSA. Although no one has admitted this on the record, these are some of the things the NSA is rumored to privately
suggest to companies wishing to export their cryptographic products:
  - Leak a key bit once in a while, embedded in the ciphertext.
  - "Dumb down" the effective key to something in the 30-bit range.   For example, while the algorithm might accept a 100-bit key, most   of those keys might be equivalent.
  - Use a fixed IV, or encrypt a fixed header at the beginning of   each encrypted message. This facilitates a known-plaintext attack.
  - Generate a few random bytes, encrypt them with the key, and then
  put both the plaintext and the ciphertext of those random bytes at   the beginning of the encrypted message. This also facilitates a   known-plaintext attack.
NSA gets a copy of the source code, but the algorithm's details remain secret from everyone else. Certainly no one advertises any of these deliberate weaknesses, but beware if you buy a U.S. encryption product that has been approved for export.
Bruce added the last "beware" phrase to the 2nd edition.

state wants to bug you AND YOU choose to use a handset which DOES NOT break the analogue path between the microphone and the ISDN NTU / TA (all standard analogue phones break the circuit, AFAIK.  It's only the speakerphone gadgets that could be subverted.) Then I suppose this is possible.  But who gives a s**t about the .1% of vulnerable phones. And it would be dead easy to mod them to defeat any such attempt.  There are loads of easier ways to mount covert surveillance than screwing up the phone system!
   >and listen into conversations occurring near the phone,
   >without the user being aware that it is happening."
ISDN is NOT a 'message switching protocol', and there is none as such on Sys X and Y, which use SS7 for inter-switch signalling anyway.  The ISDN interfaces and service are only defined for the ends of various types of subscriber line, as far as I remember.  What happens inside the provider
network is up to the provider and is not ISDN.
I'm much more concerned about the Echelon system which was (finally)
reported in the Sunday Telegraph just before Xmas.  This system, it is
alleged, can intercept and look for keywords in ALL international comms
traffic.  I believe this also gets a mention in the Europarliament report.
Vote early and often for freely available strong encryption!!

Hi, John.   Received a letter and phone call from Jim, as below.
.   He had a little altercation with a fellow prisoner ("through no fault
of my own" - he thinks he was set up) and his privileges were reduced for
35 days, so that he could only make one phone call each week.
.   In reference to the bad publicity (all those articles and news alerts)
which his case received, he speculates that the government gave a copy of
AP to a 'think tank' like Rand, etc., with the request to figure out how to
stop or delay AP. But it is his conclusion that AP is unstoppable, although:
"I think that one last (temporary) hope for government is to delay AP.
Chances are good that the "think tank" decided thatt the best way to delay
AP is to discredit me, its author.  It was a desperate gamble, particularly
because the act of harrassing me automatically gives AP more publicity.
That's the reason they will fail; the more they try to "get" me, the worse
it will be for them."
He wants it noted that his writing and discussions of AP ideas are in the
sense of a "prediction", a "warning", or even a "vision", not an advocacy
of it.
.   Regarding his guilty plea, he said it was because he realizes that he
did do a few things wrong and that, although he did think that some of the
charges against him were overblown and distorted, there was enough of a
risk of being found guilty that it didn't make a lot of sense to contest
them.  He adds, "I also felt (and still do, of course) that government had
already 'lost the war' so to speak."
.   He expects to be out around mid-April. Upon his release he wants to
go to some of his favorite restaurants, and to have several BIG pizzas.  He
hopes he can get his old job back as electronics designer, and has some
ideas he wants to work on for a virtual reality peripheral device which
will bring everyone steps closer to the Star Trek Next Generation 'holodek'.

@_subject: Soft Tempest 
Bruce Sterling, and others, have asked of the Washington Post story
[see below]:
The Washington Post gives a highly distorted account of some very
important scientific work we have done. I suggest that list members
read our paper -  - for
themselves before getting carried away.
The story is as follows. Bill G gave our department $20m for a new
building, and his people said that what they really wanted from our
group was a better way to control software copying.  So it would have
been rather churlish of us not to at least look at their `problem'.
Now the `final solution' being peddled by the smartcard industry (and
others) is to make software copying physically impossible, by tying
program execution to a unique tamper-resistant hardware token. We
wouldn't like to see this happen, and we have already done a lot to
undermine confidence in the claims of tamper-proofness made by
smartcard salesmen.
So Markus and I sat down and tried to figure out what we could do for
the Evil Empire. We concluded that (1)  large companies generally pay for their software; (2)  if you try to coerce private individuals, the political backlash      would be too much; so (3)  if the Evil Empire is to increase its revenue by cracking down on
     piracy, the people to go after are medium sized companies.
So the design goal we set ourselves was a technology that would enable
software vendors to catch the medium-sized offender - the dodgy
freight company that runs 70 copies of Office 97 but only paid for one
- while being ineffective against private individuals.
We succeeded.
In the process we have made some fundamental discoveries about
Tempest. Army signals officers, defence contractors and spooks have
been visibly flabberghasted to hear our ideas or see our demo.
In the old days, Tempest was about expensive hardware - custom
equipment to monitor the enemy's emissions and very tricky shielding
to stop him doing the same to you. It was all classified and strictly
off-limits to the open research community.
We have ended that era. You can now use software to cause the
eavesdropper in the van outside your house to see a completely
different image from the one that you see on your screen. In its
simplest form, our technique uses specially designed `Tempest fonts'
to make the text on your screen invisible to the spooks. Our paper
tells you how to design and code your own.
There are many opportunities for camouflage, deception and misconduct.
For example, you could write a Tempest virus to snarf your enemy's PGP
private key and radiate it without his knowledge by manipulating the
dither patterns in his screen saver. You could even pick up the signal
on a $100 short wave radio. The implications for people trying to
build secure computer systems are non-trivial.
Anyway, we offered Bill G the prospect that instead of Word radiating
the text you're working on to every spook on the block, it would only
radiate a one-way function of its licence serial number.  This would
let an observer tell whether two machines were simultaneously running
the same copy of Word, but nothing more. Surely a win-win situation,
for Bill and for privacy.
But Microsoft turned down our offer. I won't breach confidences, but
the high order bit is that their hearts are set on the kind of
technology the smartcard people are promising - one that will
definitively prevent all copying, even by private individuals. We
don't plan to help them on that, and I expect that if they field
anything that works, the net result will be to get Microsoft
dismembered by the Department of Justice.
Meantime we want our Soft Tempest technology to be incorporated in as many products as possible - and not just security products!
So to Rainier Fahs, who asked:
I say this: our discovery, that Tempest protection can be done in
software as well as hardware, puts it beyond the reach of effective
export control. So yes, you now have a choice. You didn't before,

British Technology Might Flush Out Software Pirates
By John Burgess
Washington Post Foreign Service
Saturday, February 7, 1998; Page H01 CAMBRIDGE, England- It's a technique that intelligence
agencies have used for years: Park a van filled with
monitoring gear near an embassy and listen for the faint radio
signals that computers routinely emit when they are on.
Analyze those signals for clues to the data that are on the
Now researchers at the University of Cambridge, home of
groundbreaking work in intelligence over the years, are trying
to adapt this technology to the fight against software piracy.
With special code written into software, they say, computers
could be made to broadcast beacons that would carry several
hundred yards and identify the software they were running,
complete with serial numbers of each copy.
Vans run by anti-piracy groups could pull up outside a
company's office and count the number of software signals
emanating from it. If, say, 50 beacons for a particular title
were detected but the company had licensed only two copies
of the software, that could become evidence on which a court
would issue a search warrant.
Ross Anderson, a University of Cambridge lecturer who is
overseeing the project, said the idea originated last year when
Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates visited the university
after his private foundation announced a $20 million donation
to the school. Gates told officials that, among other things, he
would love the university to come up with new anti-piracy
So far, Microsoft isn't enthusiastic about the university's
approach, Anderson said. "They have some reservations.
Obviously there are Big Brother aspects," he said. A
Microsoft spokeswoman said the company has no plans to
adapt the technology.
Emilia Knight, a vice president at BSA Europe, a trade group
that combats software piracy, said such an anti-piracy system
might be technically feasible. But she noted many practical
questions on the legal side, such as how the system would
differentiate between companies pirating software and those
legally using multiple copies of programs.
Knight said that concerns of privacy and consumer rights
might make the system a no-go for industrialized countries.
But in places like Eastern Europe, she suggested, where piracy
is rampant and there is no tradition of such protections, the
software signal detectors might be acceptable.
Richard Sobel, a political scientist who teaches at Harvard
University and researches privacy issues, called it "an
appalling idea."
"If the technology is there to identify what software people are
using, there's the prospect to figure out what people are doing.
. . . It sounds like a horrible violation of privacy," Sobel said.
In Britain, however, it might seem less controversial. Here
authorities have long used similar techniques to ferret out
people who fail to pay the annual license fee of about $150
that the law requires for each TV set in the country.
Cruising the streets here are vans carrying equipment that can
detect emissions from a TV set's "local oscillator," the part
that turns a station's signal into a picture. If the gear senses a
TV set inside a house from which there is no record of a
license payment, this is used as evidence to levy fines.
The system also can tell what channel people are watching
because the oscillator gives off a slightly different signal for
each one.
Anderson's researchers have built a prototype that can detect
the type of software running on a machine from short range --
the hallway outside the room where the computer is running.
Anderson said they are ready to build prototype hardware
with a longer range, at a cost of about $15,000-$30,000 -- if
the lab can find a customer. So far, none has stepped forward.

     Today's Washington Post claims that a Cambridge research team led by one      Ross Anderson is developing technology that would require all personal      computers to broadcast the identity of all programs they are running so      that anti-piracy investigators can sit outside universities and businesses      and check to see whether the folks inside are running more programs than      their licenses allow.       The article says that even Microsoft thinks this might go too far in      invading the privacy of computer users. But advocates for the technology      claim that it will work fine in benighted Eastern European countries where      piracy is rampant and the natives are used to having their privacy invaded.
     This raises at least three questions:
     1.  Is this story correct?
     2.  If so, is the Ross Anderson it describes the same Ross Anderson known      on this list for his attacks on Big Brother?
     3.  If so, are we to understand that Ross objects not so much to invading      privacy as to government competition in that endeavor?

Much praise is due Markus and Ross for their astonishing
accomplishment in long-neglected Tempest research.
Their paper is surely causing sleeplessness in dens of
TEMPESTed security agencies accustomed to having
singular self-privacy and others-invasiveness via this technology. Microsoft is to be praised for funding the right thing for the wrong reasons, or perhaps Mr. Gates foresaw what the outcome would be and merely needs intel deniability,
nicely aided by Ross's zipperedness -- that, too, well done.

U.S. Losing Battle on Control of Data Encryption, Study Says
By Jeri Clausing
Washington -- The Clinton Administration is losing its battle
to increase international controls over how reliably computer
data can be scrambled to insure privacy, according to a report
to be released Monday by an independent research group. ...
The Electronic Privacy Information Center says that its survey of 243 governments showed that the United
States is virtually the only democratic, industrialized nation
seeling domestic regulation of strong encryption.
That finding directly contradicts the Clinton Administration's
assertions in Congressional hearings that it has the support of
most nations on this issue. ...
William Reinsch, the Under Secretary for export administration
in the United States Commerce Department, denied that the study
contradicted the Administration's assertions. "All the Administration has ever said is that there are more countries that go farther  than we do," Mr. Reinsch said. "The study confirms that."

It's easy to fault the military as an organization, as easy as

What's hard is to know the unexplainable of combat and
be unable to convey what it's like to those who haven't
had the peculiar disorientation of losing whatever ability you've ever had to tell the difference between living and No book or film or general has ever got right, nor any tale told by skulled out vets sober or not.
What's never told is what it's like to lose control of mind and
body for days weeks and months. Maybe it can't be told, can't be remembered, can't be related in normal ways of communicating. Maybe that's why some of the best war
stuff is created by those who've never been there.
Enduring an artillery barrage is beyond comprehension, your
body goes to pieces under the crushing sound and concussion,
and involuntary reactions overwhelm the normal controls of all
organs and orifices. Every part goes haywire, beyond stopping,
everybody on the scene can't help becoming beaten meat
flopping and scrambling to get underground, trying to scream
amidst god's loudest roar of thunder and screeching richocheting
Bombing is far worse than that.
Even the hit of high speed round will hydraulic-ram your blood into
parts of your carcass it was never meant to go, and your senses
go numb with shock, and nothing works, body or mind. And that's
before you become conscious enough to see the savagery the slug's done to your precious gut, arm, leg, crotch -- if it didn't
fly through your helmet and skull leaving you permanently
There's no way to get ready for the worst you'll ever experience
and wish you hadn't. Maybe that's why most vets forget what
they actually experienced and fall back on the tired and true lies
of war stories. Nobody could possibly believe the other if you
could manage to tell the truth, which I doubt anybody's got the
courage to do, to relive that, when every instinct of survival is to go blank.
Which is why you'll see now and then some who just sit and stare a long way past the horizon, like math geniuses in Princeton deep
Anyway, this has nothing to do with recruiting and patriotism which are about wholly believable war stories like you see
on tv and hear down at the lodge and bar.

"Over himself, over his own mind and body, the individual is sovereign"
(J.S. Mill, On Liberty, 1859)
           Next Week's British Encryption Ban
                      by Sean Gabb
Earlier this evening, I was given confidential information by someone
close to a British Cabinet Minister.  I am not in the habit of speaking
to such people, let alone having them leak state secrets to me.  But
that is what happened.  In publishing what I heard, I am now risking a
prosecution under the Official Secrets Acts - or, more likely, being
made to look ridiculous if what I predict does not happen.  These risks
being accepted, here is the leak.
Next Tuesday, the 17th February 1998, the Department of Trade and
Industry will announce plans to outlaw the use of strong encryption
software within the United Kingdom.  We are to be encouraged - and
ultimately forced - to encrypt our e-mail only in ways that will allow
the authorities to read it.
My source was vague about the details of the scheme, saying that they
had not yet been circulated to the full Cabinet.  But I imagine that it
will be more or less a reprint of the Conservative Government's public
consultation paper of March 1997.  This came to nothing because of the
change of Government, and it was even hoped that Labour would have a
more liberal policy on Internet regulation.  However, Margaret Beckett,
the Minister now responsible for trade and industrial policy, is neither
bright nor forceful; and she was early captured by the officials who in
theory are supposed to do her bidding.  If next Tuesday's consultation
paper differs at all from the last one, it will be only in matters of
small detail and presentation.  For this reason, it is probably safe to
take the last paper as a guide to what we can expect.
The Government will propose creating a network of what are called
Trusted Third Parties, or TTPs.  These are to be organisations licensed
to provide encryption services to the public - that is, software,
consultancy and other support.  Because they have been licensed by the
State, we are to be encouraged to believe that they really are
trustworthy - that they are not distributing bad encryption software, or
robbing their clients in other ways.  But just in case we decide not to
believe any of this, it will be made illegal for any unlicensed person
to offer encryption services.  Here, it is worth quoting from last
year's consultation paper:
    The legislation will prohibit an organisation from offering or
providing encryption services to the UK public without a licence.
Prohibition will be irrespective of whether a charge is made for such
services.  The offering of encryption services to the UK public (for
example via the Internet) by an unlicensed TTP outside of the UK will
also be prohibited.  For this purpose, it may be necessary to place
restrictions on the advertising and marketing of such services to the
Enacted into law, this would make it illegal for me to copy encryption
software from my hard disk for a friend, and for computer magazines to
include it on their free cover disks.  It would also allow a strict
supervision of the material and the links given access to by British
sites on the World Wide Web.
The paper never clarifies why we need TTPs in the first place, or why -
their need granted - they can only be trusted if licensed by the State.
But it does say a lot about law enforcement and national security.  Or,
to be more accurate, it does say a lot in the usual code about the need
to fill in any last potholes on the road to a British police state.
Starting with the Interception of Communications Act 1985, the British
State has given itself powers of surveillance that a Third World
dictator might envy.  It can tap our phones on the word of a Minister.
It can burgle our homes and leave recording devices behind on the word
of a senior policeman.  It can trawl through and inspect any records on
us held by any organisation.  It can do all this without our knowledge,
and without any effective system of appeal and redress.  The relevant
laws are careful to describe the permissions for this as "warrants".
But they really are no more than what in France before the Revolution
were called Lettres du Cachet - things that our ancestors boasted did
not and could not exist in the freer air of England.
The spread of personal computers seemed likely at first to extend the
scope of surveillance still further.  This had until then been limited
by cost.  For all the theoretical risks, sending letters in sealed
envelopes through the post has always been reasonably secure:  the costs
of interception can only be justified in exceptional cases.  For the
same reason, most private papers are safe.  But the routing of an
increasing amount of mail through the Internet promised to bring down
the costs of surveillance to the point where everyone could be watched.
The storage of records on computers connected to the Internet promised
to make it possible for the authorities to spy on people by remote
The problem is the development of strong encryption software like pgp,
and its growing popularity among millions of ordinary people who, though
not criminals, have a strong regard for privacy.  It allows us to keep
our e-mail and private records secret to all but the most determined and
expensive attacks.  It gives to us the benefits of instant communication
and mass data storage, but keeps the authorities - despite their new
powers of surveillance - no better informed than in the old days of due
process and envelope steaming.
Therefore all the talk of Trusted Third Parties.  The terms of their
licences will require them to sell encryption software with keys that
cannot be modified by their clients, and to collect and store copies of
these keys for handing over to the authorities.  Last year's document is
full of promises about "strict safeguards" and the like.  But the
reality is this:
    The legislation will provide that the Secretary of State may issue a
warrant requiring a TTP to disclose private encryption keys... or a body
covered by that warrant.
No mention of judicial involvement at the time, or judicial review
afterwards - just more police state commands.
We can ignore anything the Government parrots next week about law
enforcement and national security - or, for that matter, child
pornography and complex fraud.  These really are just code words.  If I
were a criminal, or a terrorist, or a foreign spy, the last encryption
software I would use would come from a Trusted Third Party.  Strong
encryption packages are available all over the Internet, or can pass
from hand to hand on a single floppy disk.  Nor would I worry much about
laws against the transmission of data encrypted with unlicensed
software.  There are ways of keeping the authorities from even knowing
that an Internet message contains encrypted data.
Somewhere, I have an early version of a program called Steganography,
created by Romana Machado.  This takes an encrypted text and merges it
into a graphics file.  My version produces a visible degradation of
picture quality.  Almost certainly, the newer releases have solved this
problem.  Assuming I had them, and were sufficiently unpatriotic -
neither applies in my case, let me add - I could e-mail this country's
battle plans straight off to Saddam Hussain merged invisibly into a
picture of my dog.  GCHQ would never notice until the Scud missiles
began landing on Cheltenham.
No - the encryption ban will be aimed at us, the honest public.  We are
the people who tend to respect the law - or at least to be afraid of it
enough to comply in most cases.  It is our privacy that is to be
stripped away.  It is we who are to become like Winston Smith, living
for every moment when the telescreens are not monitoring our facial
Why this is desired I cannot say.  But we are living though an age of
withering trust in the common people.  In this country, we are not
trusted to possess guns for our self-defence - or indeed to carry carpet
knives locked inside our cars.  We are not trusted to choose and
administer our own medicines, or to bring up our own children in the
manner of our choice, or to decide whether or not oxtail soup might be
bad for us.  Plugging in the telescreens is only a logical next step.
Normally, when I write on these issues, I work myself into a frenzy of
pessimism.  At the moment, though, I feel rather optimistic.  Next
Tuesday's proposals will cause an uproar.  This will not come from the
so-called civil liberties groups like Liberty - excepting a few small
bodies like the Libertarian Alliance, they have all been taken over by
New Labour apparatchiks who can be trusted to keep their mouths shut.
It will come from the big business interests.
British Telecom is the third or fourth largest telecommunications
company in the world.  If operates in more than 40 markets, often
needing to provide its clients with very secure networks.  In the City
of London there are more representative offices of foreign banks than in
the rest of the European Union combined.  These have a taste for
confidentiality.  There are many other large interests - all paying
billions in taxes, all likely to be very hostile to any scheme that will
make them appear less useful to foreign clients.  We have a Labour
Government that still needs to establish itself in the public mind as a
party friendly to business.  These facts can surely be trusted to ensure
the dropping of a scheme that would not merely turn the country into a
full police state, but also do the greatest damage to British business
since nationalisation.
Or so I hope.

In response to Greg Broiles' and Ulf  Möller's posts and the prospect of a UK ban on non-escrowed encryption next Tuesday:
                       Opening Address
             Under Secretary William A. Reinsch                  Bureau of Export Administration                    U.S. Department of Commerce

One of the reasons why our licensing load is inching back up is the transfer of encryption licensing to Commerce earlier this year. No speech from me would be complete without a paragraph on encryption, so here it is. Our policy is intended to balance the competing interests of privacy, electronic commerce, law enforcement, and national security. We believe that use of key recovery technologies is the best way to achieve that balance. We do not focus narrowly on a single technology or approach. We expect the market to make those judgments, but we are taking steps to facilitate the development and dissemination of these products.
Our regulations allow recoverable encryption products of any strength and key length to be exported freely after a single review by the government. To encourage movement toward recoverable products, we have also created a special, two-year liberalization period during which companies may export 56 bit DES or equivalent products provided they submit plans to develop key recovery products. This provides an incentive for manufacturers to develop these products, which in turn will facilitate the development of key management infrastructures. So far, we have approved 47 plans, from companies large and small, and have five more pending.
In terms of licenses, in calendar year 1997, we received 2076 applications, and approved 1801 licenses with a dollar value of $4.7 billion. (The reason for the high dollar value is because we approve encryption licensing arrangements for extended periods of time, from 4 to 10 years.)
The interagency working group on cryptography policy, which includes representatives from BXA, NSA, and the FBI, continue to meet to discuss ways to streamline the licensing process on encryption export licenses. Several items have been identified and progress is being made in these areas. We have established a pre-Operating Committee group to discuss contentious cases. In part as a result, no encryption cases have been escalated to the OC since mid-December. We have created an Autolist to eliminate agency referrals. So far, we have agreed to list specific products amounting to 20% of the products we see. This means, once implemented, that a subset of licenses can be processed by Commerce without prior referral to other agencies. Finally, we have posted on our web page "helpful hints" to make the encryption licensing process more transparent:   We continue to work on other initiatives to streamline the process.
We are also discussing with our trading partners a common approach to encryption policy. We have found that most major producing countries have public safety and national security concerns similar to ours. We are working together with these governments to ensure that our policies are compatible, and that they facilitate the emergence of a key management infrastructure.
With respect to legislation, we believe the McCain-Kerrey Bill, S. 909, the Secure Public Networks Act, provides a sound basis for legislation acceptable to both Congress and the Administration. In particular, we appreciate the bill's explicit recognition of the need to balance competing objectives and of the potential for key recovery to become a market-driven mechanism to facilitate maintaining that balance. [Other excerpts of speeches by BXA officials at the seminar:]
Encryption Controls
Export Enforcement has new responsibilities in the encryption area. Over the past year, Export Enforcement has opened many new investigations involving alleged violations of the encryption regulations. These cases are being watched very closely. The national security of the United States depends in part on the government's ability to obtain timely information about the activities and plans of potentially hostile foreign parties, such as terrorists and drug dealers. ... the Department of Justice and National Security Agency participate in processing licenses for encryption. ... The increase in licenses we are experiencing is attributable not only to increased exports, but to transfer of items from the Munitions List to Commerce jurisdiction. Encryption licenses account for a significant portion of the increase. We created a special division to handle those. As of today, there is only one encryption case that has been pending over 40 days.

Frankfurt, Germany (AP) -- Germany's spy chief has denied U.S. allegations that his agents spy on American companies, but he warned German firms that such economic espionage is soaring internationally. Bernd Schmidbauer said in comments published Saturday that, in contrast to most countries' spy agencies, Germany's is not involved in any economic espionage. The Frankfurter Allgemeine daily reported that the FBI last month accused Germany of running a post near Frankfurt that eavesdrops on U.S. phones and tries to break into American computer systems. "We're astounded about those reports from the FBI," the newspaper quoted Schmidbauer as saying. He said the post is involved only in trying to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The FBI does not normally identify governments it suspects of economic spying. But an article last month, written by an FBI agent for the industry magazine Public Administration Review, lists Germany along with France, Israel, China and South Korea as major offenders. The article said more than 700 investigations involving economic espionage by foreign governments are pending before the bureau. The FBI confirmed that figure last month. The American Society for Industrial Security estimated that American businesses lost $300 billion in intellectual property to foreign and domestic spies last year. Schmidbauer said German companies also are increasingly targeted, and warned that any conversations, faxes or computer information carried over phone lines or mobile phones could be eavesdropped. "A lot of money is being lost through this form of espionage," Schmidbauer said, without giving a figure. "And it's not only east European spies that are snapping up know-how from German "Our companies are relatively naive," he said. "Concrete steps must be taken ... including encoding techniques."

   Clinton Continues to Stumble Over the 'E' Word (Encryption)
   By John Markoff
   San Francisco, Feb. 26 -- President Clinton described the
   economic impact of the Internet today in glowing terms to
   an audience of technology investors here, but he failed to
   touch on the issue that increasingly appears to matter most
   to Silicon Valley: the fiery debate over the
   Administration's policy on data scrambling.
   The Clinton Administration has endeared itself to the
   nation's high-technology center by cutting capital gains
   taxes and by calling today for a bill that would bar state
   and local governments from enacting taxes on the Internet
   until 2004. But encryption may prove to be the
   Administration's Achilles' heel in its otherwise friendly
   ties with Silicon Valley.
   The debate over encryption -- which has pitted industry and
   civil liberties groups against law enforcement and
   intelligence agencies -- has sharpened in recent weeks. New
   legislation that would restrict the unlimited use of
   encryption is about to be introduced on Capitol Hill. A
   series of intense behind-the-scenes negotiations over a
   compromise solution between the Clinton Administration and
   a small group of high-technology executives suggests that
   no simple resolution is in sight.
   Encryption policy has become a flash point because it is
   both essential for the growth of Internet commerce and
   vital for the protection of privacy. Techniques that use
   mathematical formulas permit computers to scramble data so
   they cannot be read without access to a special "key,"
   usually a large number that permits a user to unscramble
   the information. Law enforcement officials want to force
   users to put such keys in escrow with independent
   authorities to allow for electronic surveillance in
   criminal investigations.
   President Clinton has told Silicon Valley executives in
   private meetings that he is sympathetic with their
   viewpoint but that he is under great pressure from law
   enforcement and national security officials to put even
   greater controls in place on encryption technology.
   "To us this is really important, but it's just an irritant
   to him," said one Silicon Valley executive who met with the
   President before his speech today and asked not be
   identified further. "His basic message to us was, 'Can we
   get this thing done?' "
   Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Bob
   Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, are circulating a revised
   version of their encryption bill, which includes several
   changes in response to industry and privacy concerns but it
   has so far won few adherents outside of the law-enforcement
   community.
   Critics say the legislation is simply a placeholder for
   future laws that would restrict the use of the technology.
   "Everyone who is looking at the export issue is looking at
   it as a prelude to domestic controls," said Mark Rasch, a
   former Federal prosecutor who is now a specialist in
   encryption and computer security issues at the Science
   Applications International Corporation in McLean, Va.
   Industry opponents of encryption controls, heavily financed
   by high-technology companies, are preparing to announce on
   Wednesday a new coalition, Americans for Privacy, aimed at
   ending restrictions on encryption technology exports.
   At the same time Hewlett Packard plans to announce on
   Friday a new set of encryption technologies, with
   endorsements from the Department of Commerce and companies
   like I.B.M.. These technologies known as the International
   Cryptographic Framework, would let individual governments
   establish potentially conflicting encryption policies -- or
   even place no restrictions.
   Silicon Valley executives argue that the law-enforcement
   demand for the continued ability to wiretap in the
   information age is wishful thinking at best. The easy
   availability of powerful encryption software has made it
   possible for any two people, anywhere in the world to hold
   a secret conversation beyond the prying of even the most
   powerful code-breaking computer, they say.
   The White House is now considering several other industry
   proposals intent on finding a compromise between industry
   and law enforcement interests.
   Another approach that is now being raised in negotiations
   between industry executives and the White House has been
   put forth by executives from Cisco Systems, the company
   that is the dominate provider of Internet routing
   equipment.
   The Cisco proposal, known as Clearzone, would place
   encryption in the network instead of from personal computer
   to personal computer. Then, if a law-enforcement agency had
   a warrant to wiretap, it would be possible to go to an
   Internet provider that could then turn off encryption. But
   this proposal makes no provision for retrieving stored
   information also sought by law-enforcement agents.

Excerpt from congressional hearing on RF weapons:
      Mr. David Schriner is the Principal Engineer directed energy studies with Electronic Warfare Associates and a recently retired engineer with the naval weapons testing facility at China Lake. He has numerous patents, has
received superior service awards, and given technical presentations over 42 years of civil and military service. He will discuss the difficulty in building a RF weapon and the terrorist threat.
      In support of the information presented in this testimony and taking advantage of the winter's need to work indoors, a unit that uses oil spark-gaps was designed, built, and tested. The materials for it were mail-ordered at a
cost of about $500 and about one week was needed to fabricate the mechanical hardware. It use two ignition coils and a battery for power, an automobile fuel pump and filter for the oil circulation, and commonly available transformer
oil. An additional week was required to work out all of the electrical wiring, the oil lines, and the general finishing details. This unit was ready for testing in two weeks after starting the effort.       The signal radiated from the unit was measured and found to be a very significant power level that can be compared against available vulnerability
and susceptibility levels of military equipment. When the weather permits, this
unit will be tested against a set of infrastructure targets at an official test
range. consistently deadly to many types of infrastructure items at ranges suitable
for terrorist usage.       This quickly-developed low-cost system could easily be placed in a small van and used in a parking lot or directed at buildings that the van was driven past. It is highly likely that this type of device would be a very effective terrorist system and the findings of its design could be factored into another either a larger, higher powered device, or a more advanced design each with significantly greater effectiveness.       The net result of all of this design, experimentation, fabrication and measurement proves that such a weapon system could be made by anyone with an engineering degree or even a bright technician with good hardware experience. The technical information required can be found in open sources, if not just from good common engineering sense. The materials needed are nothing special
and if the effort is made, advanced concepts can be made using everyday hardware
such as automotive ignition systems. The testing to date has been very limited but
the results of this testing have provided considerable insight to just what is vulnerable in infrastructure systems. This insight and work leads to a firm opinion that a terrorist would have little trouble developing such technology
and that he would have a high probability of success in the use as an RF weapon against our infrastructure elements found in any city or near facilities around the country.       This work has been done within the proper security guidelines since:       1.The models made in my home laboratory/workshop used off-the-shelf
materials         and open-source references.
      2.The laboratory tests of this hardware were made in a controlled
environment         with the proper security in place.
      3.The results of these tests, the data capabilities, and the target set         identities are kept in a facility cleared for classified storage.
      4.The development of any of this hardware is reported on a regular
basis to         those with whom I relate at a classified level to assure that they are         informed of the work and are able to apply this to their interests and         efforts if necessary. Any of this hardware can be used by them for any
        determination of utility to military interests.       Work in this area will be continued and an aggressive test and
evaluation of these "back yard" techniques and methods will be accomplished. This process
will be done in cooperation, and if requested, under the direction of agencies with an interest in this non-military weapon related process. The author of this
report will, if requested, provide to the Committee further details at a classified level
in the proper security environment. Full hearing testimony:

Duncan Campbell has posted the message below on Echelon. Would anyone happen to have a copy of the 1988 New Statesman
article? If not, I'll dig it out of a library. More importantly, as Duncan asks, does anyone know of other original info on Echelon?
The original and primary source for information on ECHELON is an article I
wrote in New Statesman magazine ten years ago : NS, 12 August 1988 :
"They've got it taped".  In 1991, a UK World in Action programme added an important new detail about
the network, namely the presence of a DICTIONARY computer (a key part of
the system) at  GCHQ's processing centre in Westminster.  In 1993, I produced a documentary for Channel 4 - "The Hill" which related
ECHELON to the work of the Menwith Hill NSA field station near Harrogate in
Yorkshire.  In 1996, Nicky Hager in New Zealand described in his book "Secret Power"
the presence of DICTIONARY computers at two New Zealand sigint stations,
and gave extensive details of the local programming and tasking of the
ECHELON "dictionaries".  Apart from these sources, so far as I am aware all the reports that are
around are derivative and reprocessed.  The European Parliament STOA
committee report from the "Omega Foundation" is in this category and was in
fact submitted rather more than a year ago.  If anyone is aware of any
other *original* publication on this topic, could they post it. The arrival
in the public domain of original information in this area is a rarity, yet
is the foundation for the only things we "know" about the scale of NSA/GCHQ

Tim's and Michael's exchanges (with others) are most welcome,
and constructively return us again to the most compelling aspect
of the encryption debate, the contest between law and technology,
one that has impact far beyond cryptography.
There are examples of the application of law to control of technology
in the President's most recent update of "The National Emergency Caused by the Lapse of the Export Administration Act of 1979":
   It recounts the activities of the Commerce Department -- mainly BXA --
for the latest 6-month reporting period, and lists as well the cases of penalties imposed for export violations. Some of these have been imposed for alleged violations over 6 years past. They exemplify what Tim and Michael are discussing of the various ways the regulations and laws are imposed according to policy shifts and wind direction of politicians. The report describes the beef up of BXA enforcement programs, and increasing coordination with and training of other countries for export enforcement.
All justified by a "national emergency" for which the underlying law
to control technology long ago lapsed. The lapse appears to be
a deliberate way to avoid having to define ahead of time what
technology is to be controlled in order that ad hoc policy and
regulations can be devised to fit, deal by deal.
This parallels the increase in indecipherable grand jury proceedings, plea bargainings and parole conditions, determined by protected
government employees. These, to be sure, appear to be close cousins of the bloated features of legacy technologies, civilian
and military.
It worth noting that Microsoft and the Justice Department are perfect twins of technology and law monopolies, using brute force and contracts to get their way, both clothed in self-righteousness and
both led by charming weirdos, both totally obsessed with each their own mad view of law and technology in the "public interest."
Still, there's some public benefit that these disputes are white collar
and not homicidal/suicidal battles of NBC warfare, at least not yet here at home.

Mergers are complex operations, especially mergers of publicly traded companies of this size.  NAI and TIS will not fully close the merger deal for about 60 days.  Until then, there are many policy details we cannot discuss in public.
NAI has no plans to incorporate TIS's key recovery technology in any version of PGP, including our business versions.  I have discussed this
point with NAI management.
I have not changed my political values regarding privacy and crypto.
I would not have allowed the sale of my company to NAI if they were going to buy PGP in order to bury PGP, as some have feared.  They bought PGP because they value the reputation that PGP has earned in the industry.  They want to preserve that reputation by preserving PGP's product integrity.  I plan to keep watch over PGP's product integrity for the foreseeable future.
NAI plans to keep publishing our source code for peer review.  Source code publication in printed books is a vital part of NAI's business strategy, especially its overseas strategy.  There will be an important

   policies aimed at limiting the foreign sale of encryption
   technology.
   The technique, which was described this week in an Internet
   discussion among computer researchers, was introduced by
   Ronald L. Rivest, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts
   Institute of Technology and one of the inventors of the
   most widely used commercial encryption scheme, RSA.
   The new approach, which is described in a short technical
   paper that has been posted to Mr. Rivest's M.I.T. Web site
   ( is
   described as "chaffing and winnowing" digital information
   instead of encrypting it.
   According to Mr. Rivest's paper, it is possible to hide a
   message by breaking it into packets that are then secretly
   identified as good information, or "wheat," and gibberish,
   or "chaff," in such a way that an eavesdropper cannot
   distinguish the two.
   Because the individual packets would not be encrypted, Mr.
   Rivest said, such a system would circumvent current export
   restrictions.
   The two principal ways of communicating in secret are
   encryption and steganography. Steganography uses computer
   techniques to embed a secret message in a document like a
   digital image. In encryption, secret information is encoded
   using functions that require difficult mathematical tasks
   to decode, and it has become the standard way of
   transmitting secret information electronically.
   There are no restrictions on the domestic use of this
   technology, but the Government has been trying to force the
   industry to adopt standards that would permit
   law-enforcement officials to have mathematical keys
   allowing them to decode messages without the knowledge of
   the sender or receiver. The Clinton Administration says the
   standards are needed to fight crime and terrorism.
   Opponents argue that the Government decoding keys, to be
   stored in computers, could easily be stolen, compromising
   privacy and the security of credit card numbers and other
   personal information.
   In terms of exports, with few exceptions the Government
   limits the software to codes that can be easily broken.
   "Winnowing does not employ encryption, and so does not have
   a 'decryption key,' " Mr. Rivest wrote in his paper. "As
   usual, the policy debate about regulating technology ends
   up being obsoleted by technological innovations."
   Peter Neumann, an SRI International computer scientist who
   has read Mr. Rivest's paper, said that although "there is
   still no certainty that this is a practical idea," if it
   works, "it throws another clinker at the Justice
   Department."
   Other cryptography experts said they were uncertain whether
   it would be possible to skirt Government export
   restrictions in this way, but that the idea was an
   impressive new approach that might have valuable commercial
   applications.
   "He's a very clever guy," said George Spix, a Microsoft
   researcher who specializes in cryptography policy issues.
   " It goes to show that for all the technological wizardry
   in the world, there's nothing like an intellect."
   One of the potential limitations of the new method is that
   the total information transmitted might need to be hundreds
   of times larger than the actual message.
   Mr. Rivest said, however, that he had discussed the idea
   with Adi Shamir, an Israeli cryptographer, and that Mr.
   Shamir had proposed compression methods that would reduce
   the total transmission to only about twice the actual
   message size.
   The strength of the idea for chaffing and winnowing is that
   it is possible to prove mathematically that a message
   cannot be decoded, Mr. Rivest said.
   He said he had come up with the idea recently while
   teaching an undergraduate computer course.
   In addition to his role as associate director of the
   Laboratory of Computer Science at M.I.T., Mr. Rivest is a
   consultant and shareholder in RSA Data Security Inc., a
   company that develops encryption software.
   "I put the winnowing and chaffing idea out there to
   stimulate debate,"' Mr. Rivest said. "I hope it will help
   clear up some of the issues that have been raised in the
   policy discussion.

The April 9 New York Review of Books has published a long special supplement, "The Fall of TWA 800: The Possibility
of Electromagnetic Interference," by Elaine Scarry, a noted author
and Harvard professor:
     (128K with 3 images)
The article closely examines the possibility of electromagnetic
interference in TWA 800's controls, comm, and black boxes
by activities of the ten US military planes and ships in the
vicinity which were heavily equipped for electronic warfare and were conducting tests of the gear. It is reports on what is publically known about the EM armaments
of planes and ships in the vicinity, about secret EM weapons and defenses, the several dozen military and commercial planes that have crashed due to EMI, military studies of long-standing EM hazards which will not be released to crash investigators, current research in EMI and what scientists in the field think about the possibility of EMI causing the fall of TWA 800.
It calls for the military to release its classified EMI research to
NTSB investigators, and short of that, for the servicemen and women on the planes and ships at the scene to tell what they know. It asks Congress to order military cooperation.
Not at all inflammatory or accusatory, it is thoroughly researched (over 100 notes and citations) and highly informative on the hazards of EMI, and worthy of ciritque by learned scientists in the field here.
Coda: Ron Brown's crash is not mentioned but its characteristics fit several other EMI accidents for which the military will not
release findings, claiming that national security EM weapons
secrets would be jeopardized.

New Judge to Decide Whether Export Restrictions on Software Violate
   Constitutional Guarantees of Freedom of Speech and of the Press
Reply Briefs in Junger v. Daley Available on World Wide Web
   ----------------------------------------------------------------

     _________________________________________________________________
Cleveland, Ohio, March 26 -- A status conference in the case of Junger v. Daley, the suit in which
a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio
seeks to enjoin the enforcement by the United States Department of
Commerce of the export regulations on encryption software, will be
held Friday, March 27, at 10:00 a.m. in the chambers of Federal
District Judge James S. Gwin in the federal courthouse in Akron,
Ohio.  The case turns on the issue of whether the publication in
electronic form of encryption software---software that is used to
preserve the privacy of electronic communications and data stored on a
computer---is entitled to protection under the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution.
Judge Gwin, a recent appointee to the federal bench who previously
served on the Ohio Court of Common Pleas, has replaced Judge Donald
C. Nugent as the judge responsible for the litigation. The plaintiff, Professor Peter Junger, who teaches a course in
Computing and the Law and who wishes to publish his class materials
containing some encryption programs on his World Wide Web server,
seeks an injunction against the enforcement by the defendant, Commerce
Secretary Daley, of the export regulations promulgated the Department
of Commerce that require anyone who wishes to publish encryption
software of the Internet or on the World Wide Web to first obtain a
license from the Bureau of Export Administration.
Both sides have filed for summary judgment.  Junger argues that the
freedoms of speech and of the press that are secured by the First
Amendment protect the writing and publication of computer programs.
The government, on the other hand, argues that computer programs are
not entitled to the protection of the First Amendment because they are
``functional''. Each side has filed a brief in support of its motion for summary
judgment.  These briefs and the complaint and motions for summary
judgment are available at  and
.  In addition both sides
have filed reply briefs that are now available at:
In his reply brief the plaintiff's lawyers argue:  ``Making software available on the Internet and the World Wide Web is publication of
that software, and publication in that medium is entitled to the
unqualified protection of the First Amendment.''
The government responds to this argument in its reply brief by
claiming that software is a ``functional item'' and thus not entitled
to protection as speech.  In furtherance of this claim it points out,
``Much software ... is designed to cause substantial harm,'' and that
``software can be used to invade privacy, commit fraud, and
substantially disrupt and endanger people's lives.''
``That is rather a perverse argument,'' says Junger, ``considering
that encryption software is used to protect against exactly the harms
that the government lists and that there is no law against the use of
encryption software, while, of course, there are laws against invading
privacy, committing fraud, and substantially disrupting and
endangering people's lives.  It is clear that the government does not
claim just the right to regulate the writing and publication of
encryption software.  It claims the right to forbid the writing and
publication of any type of computer program whatsoever without being
in any way restricted by the First Amendment.  There are, of course,
some types of speech, like obscenity, that the courts have held are
not entitled to the protection of the First Amendment, but no court
has ever subscribed to the government's remarkable theory that the
First Amendment does not protect functional speech.''
``My case,'' says Junger, ``is not just about the constitutionality of
the regulations forbidding the export of encryption software, though
that is an extremely important issue.  The real issue is whether the
First Amendment protects the writing and publication of any type of
computer program.''

  Mr. LEAHY. In my view, encryption legislation should promote the following goals:
  First, legislation should ensure the right of Americans to choose how to protect the privacy and security of their communications and information;
  Second, legislation should bar a government-mandated key escrow encryption system;
  Third, legislation should establish both procedures and standards for access by law enforcement to decryption keys or decryption assistance for both encrypted communications and stored electronic information and only permit such access upon court order authorization, with appropriate notice and other procedural safeguards;
  Fourth, legislation should establish both procedures and standards for access by foreign governments and foreign law enforcement agencies to the plaintext of encrypted communications and stored electronic information of United States persons;
  Fifth, legislation should modify the current export regime for encryption to promote the global competitiveness of American companies;
  Sixth, legislation should not link the use of certificate authorities with key recovery agents or, in other words, link the use of encryption for confidentiality purposes with use of encryption for authenticity and integrity purposes;
  Seventh, legislation should, consistent with these goals of promoting privacy and the global competitiveness of our high-
tech industries, help our law enforcement agencies and national security agencies deal with the challenges posed by the use of encryption; and
  Eighth, legislation should protect the security and privacy of information provided by Americans to the government by ensuring that encryption products used by the government interoperate with commercial encryption products.
  Do you agree with these goals?
  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I agree with these goals and will look to these same items as a reference point for the drafting, introducing and passage of encryption reform legislation.
  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator agree to work with me on encryption legislation that achieves these goals and that we could bring to the floor this Congress?
  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. I believe it is critical for us to address this issue and soon. I also believe that we should work together to produce a piece of legislation that demonstrates our position on encryption policy.

Ars Electronica Festival 98 INFOWAR - information. macht. krieg.
7. - 12.9.1998
Linz, Austria
Presse - Information [Excerpts]
20.3.1998 Ars Electronica, one of the world's most highly-acclaimed festivals at the interface of art, technology and society, has been presented annually since 1979. INFOWAR, the title of this year's festival, places the strategies of data-supported wars - from the Gulf Conflict to the skirmishes of cyberguerillas - into the focal point of artistic as well as
theoretical and scientific interest, to thereby shed light on the internal logic of the information society in connection with war. Numerous events, installations, network projects, performances and a symposium make up the festival's program to confront and deal with this subject. Symposium INFOWAR
September 8 - 9, 1998 New weapons systems and military strategies will not exclusively occupy the middle point of these discussions. The aim is to elaborate on "information as a strategic weapon," the power of the media as political power, the new potential hot spots of conflict and new images of "enemy" in an information society characterized by global economic and financial markets. But this also has to do with hacker myths, cryptography, electronic bugging operations, and the serious concerns regarding national security versus private citizens' fears of the complete loss of the right of privacy. This symposium will deploy works of art and artistic responsibility as methods for coming to terms with these issues and achieving increased sensibility toward them. The information society - no longer a vague promise of a better future, but a reality and a central challenge of the here-and-now
- is founded upon the three key technologies of electricity,
telecommunications and computers: Technologies developed for the purposes, and out of the logic, of war, technologies of simultaneity and coherence, keeping our civilian society in a state of permanent mobilisation driven by the battle for markets, resources and spheres of influence. A battle for supremacy in processes of economic concentration, in which the fronts, no longer drawn up along national boundaries and between political systems, are defined by technical standards. A battle in which the power of knowledge is managed as a profitable monopoly of its distribution and dissemination. The latest stock market upheavals have laid bare the power of a global market, such as only the digital revolution could have fathered, and which must be counted as the latter¹s most widely-felt
direct outcome. The digitally-networked market of today wields more power than the politicians. Governments are losing their say in the international value of their currencies; they can no longer control, but only react. The massive expansion of freely-accessible
communication networks, itself a global economic necessity, imposes severe constraints on the arbitrary restriction of information flows. Any transgression of a critical control functions in the cybertechnologies¹ sphere of responsibility and influence puts central power wielders in a hitherto unheard-of position of vulnerability and openness to attack. The geographic frontiers of the industrial age are increasingly losing their erstwhile significance in global politics, and giving way to vertical fronts along social stratifications. Whereas, in the past, war was concerned with the conquering of territory, and later with the control of production capacities, war in the 21st century is entirely concerned with the acquisition
and exercise of power over knowledge. The three fronts of land, sea and air battles have been joined by a fourth, being set up within the global information systems. Spurred on by the "successes" of the Gulf war, the development of information warfare is running at full speed. Increasingly, the attention of the military strategists is turning away from computer-aided warfare - from potentiation of the destructive efficiency of military operations through the
application of information technology, virtual reality and high-tech weaponry - to cyberwar, whose ultimate target is nothing less than the global information infrastructure itself: annihilation of the enemy¹s computer and communication systems, obliteration of his databases, destruction of his command and control systems. Yet increasingly the vital significance of the global information infrastructure for the functioning of the international finance markets compels the establishment of new strategic objectives: not obliteration, but manipulation, not destruction, but infiltration and assimilation. "Netwar" as the tactical deployment of information and disinformation, targeted at human understanding. These new forms of post-territorial conflicts, however, have for some time now ceased to be preserve of governments and their ministers of war. NGOs, hackers, computer freaks in the service of organised crime, and terrorist organisations with high-tech expertise are now the chief actors in the cyberguerilla nightmares of national security services and defence ministries. In 1998, under the banner of "INFO WAR", the Ars Electronica Festival of Art, Technology and Society, is appealing to artists, theoreticians and technologists for contributions relating to the social and political definition of the information society. The emphasis here will lie not on technological flights of fancy, but on the fronts drawn up in a society that is in a process of fundamental and violent upheaval.

Motorola's site is informative (thanks for the pointers and comments), and perhaps cannot reveal the detail needed to compare security level to other systems in the US and other countries. Dave Emery probes the tech questions a bit and I'll go further, with Adam Shostack and others, to ask as a citizen why we cannot purchase the level of cell phone privacy that our gov and mil folks can with our money (a return to the NSA-crippled algo of CMEA and CAVE).
There has been some discussion of this on UK Crypto about
the various telco security systems in Europe and the same
critique of a double standard has been made. Cell phone
manufacturers would have a big stake in who gets the best
security to the global public first.
Moreover, as Scientific American points out in its special
section this month, applications of wireless technology are rapidly growing for a host of new information distribution,
collection and interactive purposes. The need for security
of this data floating through the spectrum could hardly
be greater, not only for privacy but for prtoection against tampering, insertion of disinformation, and a variety of new ways to warp data to fit schemes the owners and originators never dreamed of. Is end to end encryption of the STU-III sort going to be needed for all wireless or are there other plans in the works
at TLAs and TIAs?
It would be greatly appreciated if those who may be
tongue-tied by NDA and worse, if we were pointed in the
right direction by, say, semaphore, to the likely places
where we can dig out, say, by FOIA, what we need to know about Albright-privileged wireless security.
Finally, are the TAC-2000 units useful for the Secretary's
global travels? If so, are they supported by military networks overseas? Or do American officials use a different system
when traveling?

James Bamford, Duncan Campbell, Nicky Hager and others have since confirmed what the analyst revealed then and greatly extended what was at the time doubted as a young man's anti-war exaggeration.

What knocked me over was Fellwock saying that the location of the NSA training school was at Goodfellow Air Force Base, San Angelo, Texas, from whence this counterspy originates. We were told the base was mothballed, kept pickled only for
local pork. No doubt, NSA was never there, and "Fellwock" was just continuing to do his disinfo job via Ramparts.

   San Francisco, April 13 -- In successfully cracking a

   Groupe Speciale Mobile standard. The world's most widely
   used encryption system for cellular phones, G.S.M. is
   employed in about 80 million of the devices worldwide and
   by as many as two million phones in the United States.
   Most of the 58 million American analog and digital cell
   phones are based on a variety of other methods, but 20
   American cellular phone companies, including Pacific Bell,
   a unit of SBC Communications Inc., and the Omnipoint
   Corporation, use the G.S.M. standard.
   Two researchers at the University of California at Berkeley
   announced today that they had successfully broken the
   G.S.M. method by using a computer to determine a secret
   identity number stored in the Subscriber Identity Module,
   or S.I.M., a credit card-like device inside the phone.
   If criminals were to crack the method, they could "clone"
   phones protected by G.S.M. encryption -- that is, detect a
   phone's number and use it in another phone to fraudulently
   bill calls. However, both the researchers and cellular
   telephone company officials said today that the cloning
   threat was extremely remote compared with the vulnerability
   of analog cellular phones.
   For one thing, they said, cracking G.S.M. had required
   almost 10 hours of electronic probing and high-powered
   computing.
   What was even more intriguing than the security threat,
   however, was that cracking the code yielded a tantalizing
   hint that a digital key used by G.S.M. may have been
   intentionally weakened during the design process to permit
   Government agencies to eavesdrop on cellular telephone
   conversations.
   Although the key, known as A5, is a 64-bit encryption
   system -- generally an extremely difficult code to crack --
   the researchers determined that the last 10 digits were
   actually zeros. That means that with the powerful computers
   available to national intelligence agencies, it would be
   possible to decode a voice conversation relatively quickly,
   said Marc Briceno, director of the Smartcard Developers
   Association, a small programmers organization.
   "It appears the key was intentionally weakened," he said.
   "I can't think of any other reason for what they did."
   For years, the computer industry has been rife with rumors
   about encryption designers having been persuaded or forced
   by Government spy agencies to mathematically weaken
   communications security systems or to install secret
   backdoors. Some of the rumors even have the National
   Security Agency or the Central Intelligence Agency posing
   as cryptographers, designing the encryption programs
   themselves and then releasing them -- all to insure that
   they could decode data or phone conversations.
   Such rumors are fed, in part, by the hazy origins of the
   G.S.M. system. Industry cryptographic experts said that the
   underlying mathematical formulas, or algorithms, in
   G.S.M.'s encryption design were thought to have originated
   in either Germany or France as part of the creation of the
   standard in 1986 and 1987.
   But other than today's hint of an intentionally weakened
   system, little evidence has ever emerged to support
   speculation, and the researchers' suspicions were not
   universally endorsed.
   "It's possible there are other reasons for doing this,"
   Stewart Baker, a Washington lawyer who was formerly a
   lawyer for the National Security Agency, said. The N.S.A.
   is one of the agencies most often suspected of such schemes
   because a major part of its mission is to intercept
   telephone calls.
   "Speculation is easy, and it never dies," Mr. Baker said.
   Even so, most industry experts could think of no good
   reason why an encryption algorithm key would be
   intentionally shortened, other than to facilitate
   surveillance.
   "This was deliberately weakened," said Phil Karn, an
   engineer at Qualcomm Inc., a cellular telephone
   manufacturer that has developed an alternative standard to
   G.S.M. "Who do you think would be interested in doing
   something like this?"
   The weakened key was discovered by two researchers, Ian
   Goldberg and David Wagner, both members of the University
   of California at Berkeley's Internet Security Applications,
   Authentication and Cryptography Group, with the aid of Mr.
   Briceno. They stressed that they had easily detected the
   security flaw that could make digital cellular phones
   vulnerable to cloning.
   Cloning has been a costly fraud problem for.many years. But
   digital phones are widely believed to be immune from
   cloning. In San Francisco, Pacific Bell's billboard
   advertisements depict a sheep and a cell phone and boast
   that of the two only the cell phone cannot be cloned.
   Cellular telephone industry executives acknowledged the
   flaw in G.S.M. but said it actually reinforced their claims
   about the security of digital telephones.
   "My hat goes off to these guys they did some great work,"
   said George Schmitt, president of Omnipoint. "I'll give
   them credit, but we're not at any risk of fraud."
   The researchers and the Smartcard Developers Association
   said that the successful attack was new evidence of the
   shortcomings of a widespread industry practice of keeping
   security techniques hidden from public review. Real
   security, they argue, requires publication of the
   algorithms so that independent experts can verify the
   strength of the systems.
   "This shows yet again a failure of a closed design
   process," Mr. Briceno said. "These companies pride
   themselves on their security, but now the chickens are
   coming home to roost."

Ramparts in 1972 was indeed the starting point.   Sadly, many subsequent
reporters later confused what "Winslow Peck" [= Perry (not Peter) Fellwock,
which *is* his true name]  wrote about "keyword" interception of
international telephony traffic.  The story from then on ..
Early in 1976, Winslow came to London.  I interviewed him at length and
then carried out my own research on GCHQ.  I then published an article in
Time Out, June 1976, called the Eavesdroppers which did for GCHQ and the UK
what Winslow did for NSA and the US.    My co-author was another American
journalist, a Time Out staffer called Mark Hosenball.
The Eavesdroppers was the first (and full) description of what GCHQ was and
did.   There had been no previous article, although World In Action had
attempted a programme in 1972.
GCHQ's directors were apoplectic.  The more so because the combined efforts
of the GPO (who tapped my phone from May 76 onwards), the Special Branch
and MI5 (who followed MH and me around) revealed that we had actually got
the article out *without* breaking the Official Secrets Act.   I had done
my research from open technical sources, and (!) telephone directories;
Peck, as an American wasn't covered by the British law.  But they got even.   Hosenball, an American, was declared a threat to
national security and deported.   Philip Agee, the famous whistleblower
from the CIA, was added in to the deportation list.
Seven months later, I *was* arrested in the furore over their deportations
together with another Time Out reporter, Crispin Aubrey.   We had talked to
a former British sigint operator, John Berry.   The case became known as
"ABC" after our initials.   Over the coming two years, I was accused of
having too much information and faced two counts of espionage as well as
one of breaching section 2 of the Official Secrets Act (a law which was
repealed almost ten years ago now).   These counts totalled a potential
sentence of 30 years imprisonment.   At Court 1 in the Old Bailey in October 1978, this disgaceful prosecution -
which marked the high water point of MI5's manic campaigns against
"internal subversion" - fell apart.   The story has just recently been told
in the delightful autobiography of Geoff Robertson QC, who was then my no 2
lawyer.  His book is called "The Justice Game".    Maybe its time for me
own autobio ...
Mrs Thatcher put GCHQ firmly on the world map with the union ban, 5 years
later.   And now ...

The New York Times, April 16, 1998, p. D2.
   Commerce Secretary Seeks Compromise on Encryption
     Administration Reconsiders F.B.I. Position
   By Jeri Clausing
   Washington, April 15 -- The Clinton Administration's attempts to
   control encryption technology have been a failure and are forcing
   American software makers to concede ground to foreign
   competitors, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said today.
   Mr. Daley's remarks, made in a speech here to the high-technology
   industry, were the strongest indication yet that the
   Administration was seriously considering parting ways with Louis
   Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and
   other law enforcement and spy agencies over the issue of how data
   should be scrambled.
   "We are headed down a lose-lose path, and we have to get back to
   win-win," Mr. Daley said. He blamed both industry and law
   enforcement officials for the failed policy, saying that the two
   sides had failed to find a reasonable compromise between the need
   to monitor the activities of criminals and the need to offer
   consumers strong security for on-line transactions.
   The purpose of his speech today was to release the Commerce
   Department's first comprehensive report on the impact of
   electronic commerce on the nation's economy. The report shows
   that information technology, including business on the Internet,
   is growing twice as fast as the overall economy, employing some
   7.4 million workers at salaries 64 percent above the national
   average.
   But while the report was full of impressive numbers and glowing
   predictions for the future, Mr. Daley said that strong encryption
   and a solid encryption policy were essential if electronic
   commerce was to realize its full potential.
   Mr. Daley's blunt comments marked the first public acknowledgment
   that the Clinton Administration's encryption policy had failed.
   And his remarks echoed what the industry has contended for years
   -- that foreign companies are fast taking over the high-demand
   market for products that protect the privacy of communications.
   The software industry is currently prohibited from exporting
   strong encryption programs, which scramble data in ways that make
   it difficult or impossible for unauthorized people -- including
   law enforcement agencies -- to decode. Such software is essential
   to electronic commerce, which requires that credit card
   information and other private data be encrypted when products are
   ordered on the Internet.
   The software industry has long argued that the export rules put
   American companies at a great disadvantage relative to foreign
   competitors not under such restrictions. Mr. Freeh and the
   National Security Agency argue that the threat of terrorists and
   other criminals scrambling data to thwart law enforcement is so
   great that the export restrictions should be removed only if the
   police are given keys to unlock encrypted data.
   At the end of 1997, Mr. Daley said, an estimated 656 encryption
   products were being produced in 29 countries outside the United
   States. Products from Germany, Ireland, Canada, Israel and
   Britain can compete with anything made domestically, he said, and
   can meet the needs of the world's computer networks.
   "Our policy, ironically, encourages the growth of foreign
   producers at the same time it retards growth here," Mr. Daley
   said. He called for a sincere dialogue between industry and law
   enforcement, but stopped short of saying that the Administration
   would withdraw its support of the F.B.I. and N.S.A. position.
   "There are solutions out there," Mr. Daley said. "Solutions that
   would meet some of law enforcement's needs without compromising
   the concerns of the privacy and business communities. But I fear
   our search has thus far been more symbolic than sincere.
   "The cost of our failure will be high. The ultimate result will
   be foreign dominance of the market. This means a loss of jobs
   here, and products that do not meet either our law-enforcement or
   national security needs."
   Mr. Daley declined to offer examples of what the Administration
   might be willing to give up to reach an agreement.
   Industry officials, however, said there was no room for
   compromise.
   "People want complete privacy," Peter F. McCloskey of the
   Electronic Industries Alliance said.
   Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology
   Association of America, said that companies were willing to
   continue discussions with the Administration, but he asserted
   that Government officials "think compromise is something in the
   middle; sometimes compromise is found outside of the box."
   Mr. Miller said that the solution needed to be a technical one,
   perhaps one that gave law enforcement better training and
   equipment to crack encrypted criminal communications without
   requiring that everyone hand over spare keys to their computer
   files.
   "Law enforcement has legitimate concerns," Mr. Harris said. "What
   we disagree with is their demand for unlimited access."

In an April 30 Memorandum Opinion and Order Senior US District of New Mexico Judge Santiago Campos has ordered the National Security Agency to produce in camera evidence that it can refuse to respond to allegations of NSA intercepts of Libyan and Iranian encrypted messages in the 1980s.
     (102K)
This order was issued in repsonse to cryptographer Bill Payne's FOIA request for the information as part of his wrongful termination suit against NSA and Sandia National Laboratory. In the 56-page order Judge Campos reviews the principal actions in the suit, and to buttress the order for NSA to tell him what it knows about the intercepts invokes recent FOIA regulations which more stringently require intelligence agencies to substantiate the use of the "Glomar response" in refusing to affirm or deny the existence of information on the grounds that to do so would  harm national security.
He states that case law requires more diligent review in the case of "Glomarization," so he is obligated to make a review in
this instance. He states that based on what NSA has heretofore
provided the court, withholding of information on these intercepts does not appear justified.
Campos has reviewed public documents on allegations of the Swiss firm Crypto AG's "spiking" of its cryptographic equipment (with direction by NSA for backdoors) then selling it to Libya and Iran, Crypto AG's employee Hans Buehler's story of the work, Reagan's statement on the intercepts,
and other reports, and finds that while the stories are not
authoritative of the USG position, they do warrant his detailed review of NSA's Glomar response. Campos says, paraphrased, "if NSA continues to have the right it claims in this case to determine what is secret and what is not,
then it can declare anything secret and thereby undercut the very purpose of the FOIA. That is not acceptable."
It's an impressive summary of the legal conflict between the public's right to know and governmental secrecy. And may help ease access information on NSA global surveillance operations. Or, if Campos decides in NSA's favor, may shut the door more securely.

Here's the report's press release:
U. S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Export Administration
May 4, 1998  Advances in Computer Technology Make Export Controls More Difficult
Washington, D.C. -- Commerce Assistant Secretary Roger Majak and Dave Tarbell, director of the Defense Technology Security Administration at the Defense Department announced the release of a long-awaited study, "High-performance Computing, National Security Applications, and Export Control Policy at the Close of the 20th Century," by Dr. Seymour E. Goodman, Dr. Peter Wolcott and Dr. Patrick Homer. The study has been prepared as part of President Clinton's decision in 1993 to periodically assess U.S. computer export controls. Today's study provides an important contribution to the government's understanding of technology trends in the computer industry and national security uses for high performance computers.
The study finds that technology is evolving at an astounding rate in the HPC industry, rapidly increasing the performance of computers at all levels. Key findings include: 1) advancements in microprocessor performance which have brought down the costs of HPCs and reduced their size; 2) improvements in interconnect devices which have permitted a greater range of products to enter the market and helped to make high-performance power more accessible and affordable; 3) more open system architectures that contribute to enhanced calability; and 4) the ability to network the computing power of smaller systems to find solutions to large computational problems.
All of these advancements create challenges for export controls on HPCs. In particular, there is growing availability of ever more powerful computers in the world marketplace. The market for HPCs is flourishing worldwide with many new and used systems for sale through mail order and third party distribution systems. The study points out that determining what computing levels can be controlled depends on factors such as dependence on vendor support, the growing diversity of computer architectures and the scalability of computer An earlier study published by Dr. Goodman and his associates issued in 1995 predicted that computers with speeds of over 2,000 MTOPS would be widely vailable in commercial markets by 1997. Those predictions have proved
correct. This new study will be an important reference point for the Administration's continuing review of computer controls.

THE WHITE HOUSE
                    Office of the Press Secretary
For Immediate Release                                       May 12, 1998
                  INTERNATIONAL CRIME CONTROL STRATEGY
International crime is a serious and potent threat to the American
people at home and abroad.  Drug and firearms trafficking, terrorism,
money laundering, counterfeiting, illegal alien smuggling, trafficking
in women and children, advanced fee scams, credit card fraud, auto
theft, economic espionage, intellectual property theft, computer
hacking, and public corruption are all linked to international criminal
activity and all have a direct impact on the security and prosperity of
the American people.
Americans spend billions of dollars annually on cocaine and heroin, all
of which originates abroad; in 1997, there were 123 terrorist attacks
against U.S. targets worldwide, including 108 bombings and eight
kidnappings; each year, approximately one billion dollars worth of
stolen cars are smuggled out of this country; annually, U.S. companies
lose up to $23 billion from the illegal duplication and piracy of films,
compact discs, computer software, pharmaceutical and textile products,
while U.S. credit card companies suffer losses of hundreds of millions
of dollars from international fraud; and several hundred U.S. companies
and other organizations have already suffered computer attacks in 1998,
resulting in millions of dollars of losses and significant threats to
our safety and security.
The International Crime Control Strategy (ICCS) addresses this
increasing threat by providing a framework for integrating all facets of
the federal government response to international crime.  This first-ever
strategy reflects the high priority accorded international crime by this
Administration and builds on such existing strategies as the National
Drug Control Strategy and the Presidential Directives on alien
smuggling, counter-terrorism and nuclear materials safety and security.
The ICCS is also an important initiative in terms of enhancing the
ability of U.S. law enforcement officials to cooperate effectively with
their overseas counterparts in investigating and prosecuting
international crime cases.  At the upcoming Birmingham Summit, G-8
leaders will discuss international crime as one of the most pressing
issues related to increasing globalization and rapid technological and
economic change.  President Clinton will highlight the new ICCS in
underscoring the U.S. commitment to close cooperation with all nations
who are mobilizing to confront this increasing threat.
The ICCS is a plan of action containing eight broad goals with thirty
implementing objectives.  The ICCS expresses President Clinton's resolve
to combat international crime aggressively and substantially reduce its
impact on the daily lives of the American people.
The Strategy's eight goals and related objectives are:
1.   Extend the First Line of Defense Beyond U.S. Borders by      (a) preventing acts of international crime planned abroad before      they occur, (b) using all available laws to prosecute select      criminal acts committed abroad, and (c) intensifying activities      of law enforcement, diplomatic and consular personnel abroad.
2.   Protect U.S. Borders by (a) enhancing our land border inspection,
     detection and monitoring capabilities, (b) improving the      effectiveness of maritime and air smuggling interdiction efforts,      (c) seeking new, stiffer criminal penalties for smuggling      activities, and (d) targeting enforcement and prosecutorial      resources more effectively against smuggling crimes and      organizations.
3.   Deny Safe Haven to International Criminals by (a) negotiating new
     international agreements to create a seamless web for the prompt
     location, arrest and extradition of international fugitives,      (b) implementing strengthened immigration laws that prevent      international criminals from entering the United States and      provide for their prompt expulsion when appropriate, and      (c) promoting increased cooperation with foreign law enforcement      authorities.
4.   Counter International Financial Crime by (a) combating money
     laundering and strengthening enforcement efforts to reduce inbound      and outbound movement of criminal proceeds, (b) seizing the assets      of international criminals, (c) enhancing bilateral and      multilateral cooperation against all financial crime, and      (d) targeting offshore centers of international fraud,      counterfeiting, electronic access device schemes and other      financial crimes.
5.   Prevent Criminal Exploitation of International Trade by (a)
     interdicting illegal technology exports, (b) preventing unfair and
     predatory trade practices in violation of U.S. criminal law, (c)
     protecting intellectual property rights, (d) countering industrial
     theft and economic espionage of U.S. trade secrets, and (e)      enforcing import restrictions on certain harmful substances,      dangerous organisms and protected species.
6.   Respond to Emerging International Crime Threats by (a) disrupting      new activities of international organized crime groups,      (b) enhancing intelligence efforts against criminal enterprises,      (c) reducing trafficking in human beings and crimes against      children, (d) increasing enforcement efforts against high tech      and computer-related crime, and (e) continuing to identify and      counter the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructures and new      technologies in high tech areas.
7.   Foster International Cooperation and the Rule of Law by      (a) establishing international standards, goals and objectives to      combat international crime and by actively encouraging compliance,      (b) improving bilateral cooperation with foreign governments and      law enforcement authorities, and (c) strengthening the rule of law      as the foundation for democratic government and free markets in      order to reduce societies' vulnerability to criminal exploitation.
8.   Optimize the Full Range of U.S. Efforts by (a) enhancing executive
     branch policy and operational coordination mechanisms to assess      the risks of criminal threats and to integrate strategies, goals      and objectives to combat those threats, (b) mobilizing and      incorporating the private sector into U.S. government efforts, and      (c) developing measures of effectiveness to assess progress over      time.

funding for FY1999, May 7, 1998:
    The Committee remains concerned about efforts to inappropriately ease or remove export restrictions on hardware and software encryption products. Export controls on encryption and other products serve a clearly defined purpose--to protect our nation's security. Therefore, the Committee believes that the effects on U.S. national security must be the paramount concern when considering any proposed change to encryption export policy, and will seek referral of any legislation regarding encryption export policy under its jurisdiction established under Senate Resolution 400.
    Export restrictions on encryption products assist the Intelligence Community in its signals intelligence mission. By collecting and analyzing signals intelligence, U.S. intelligence agencies seek to understand the policies, intentions, and plans of foreign state and nonstate actors. Signals intelligence plays an important role in the formation of American foreign and defense policy. It is also a significant factor in U.S. efforts to protect its citizens and soldiers against terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, narcotics trafficking, international crime and other threats to our nation's security.
    While the Committee recognizes the commercial interest in easing or removing export restrictions, it believes the safety of our citizens and soldiers should be the predominant concern when considering U.S. policy towards the export of any product. The Committee supports the continued control of encryption products, and believes that a comprehensive strategy on encryption export policy can and must be developed that addresses national security concerns as well as the promotion of American commercial interests abroad. The Committee looks forward to working with senior Administration officials in developing such a strategy.

Congressional Record: May 15, 1998 (Senate)
                    DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT
  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a section in the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act that I am particularly proud of, and
that is the law enforcement exception in the bill. At the Judiciary
Committee markup, Senator Grassley and I, along with the assistance of
Chairman Hatch and Senator Ashcroft worked to strengthen the law
enforcement exception in the bill. We received input on the language
from the copyright community and the administration: the National
Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the
Departments of Commerce and Justice, and the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB).
  The law enforcement exception ensures that the government continues
to have access to current and future technologies to assist in their
investigative, protective, or intelligence activities. I am concerned
that the tools and resources of our intelligence and law enforcement
communities are preserved--and more importantly, not limited, by
passage of S. 2037. Under that bill, a company who contracts with the
government can continue to develop encryption/decryption devices under
that contract, without having to worry about criminal penalties.
  Because much of our leading technologies come from the private
sector, the government needs to have access to this vital resource for
intelligence and law enforcement purposes.
  The law enforcement exception recognizes that oftentimes governmental
agencies work with non-governmental entities--companies, in order to
have access to and develop cutting edge technologies and devices. Such
conduct should not be prohibited or impeded by this copyright

Telephone card fraud in the millions of dollars.
Hackers from the Netherlands have inundated the German market with illegally
recharged telephone cards, causing losses in the several millions of marks
(millions of dollars), stated the weekly Focus, due out Monday.
In breaking the telephone cards' code, the hackers succeeded in recharging
cards emptied of their credit.
The German association of tobacconist wholesalers assesses losses at 60
million marks (33 million dollars), reports Focus.
The con men bought used cards by the thousands from collectors. As a
result, their intitial price of five pfenning (2.7 cents) per card quickly
rose to one mark (55 cents).
According to experts cited by Focus, the recharged cards, which the
pirates resold at a lesser or equivalent price, are impossible to
distinguish from those purchased legitimately.
Card producers intend to stop this illegal commerce thanks to a new software
program allowing used cards to be electronically marked, the weekly believes.

Clinton Backs Cyber-Terror Warnings
Filed at 1:31 p.m. EDT
By The Associated Press
ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Nuclear warheads were the stuff of Cold War
stockpiles and beachheads the battlefields of times gone by. To counter
today's threats, President Clinton told a new class of Naval officers, the
United States must amass germ-warfare vaccines and battle terrorists in
cyberspace. ``If our children are to grow up safe and free, we must approach these new
21st century threats with the same rigor and determination we applied to the
toughest security challenges of this century,'' the president said today in
a commencement speech at the U.S. Naval Academy. For the 769 graduating midshipmen and 139 midshipwomen whose dress uniforms
shone blindingly white in the sun, Clinton painted a near-apocalyptic
picture of the enemies who threatened their mission beyond the academy. ``As we approach the 21st century, our foes have extended the fields of
battle from physical space to cyberspace, from the world's vast bodies of
water to the complex workings of our own human body. Rather than invading
our beaches or launching bombers, these adversaries may attempt cyber
attacks against our critical military systems and our economic base,''
Clinton said. Clinton also called for an interconnected ``cyber-system'' that would warn
and minimize damage of attacks on computers that control the stock market,
banking, utilities, air traffic and other so-called ``critical
infrastructure.'' Private companies including IBM, Dell Computers, Bell South and GTE have
already agreed to participate in the ``cyber-system,'' which Clinton wants
to be fully operational by 2003, administration officials said. ``If we fail to take strong action, then terrorists, criminals and hostile
regimes could invade and paralyze these vital systems, disrupting commerce,
threatening health, weakening our capacity to function in a crisis,''
Clinton said. He appointed National Security Council adviser Richard Clarke, who
specializes in such issues as drug trafficking and terrorism, to head a new
office on infrastructure protection and counter-terrorism. Former Sen. Sam
Nunn and Jamie Gorelick, formerly the Justice Department's No. 2 official
and now Fannie Mae's vice chairwoman, will lead a private industry advisory
group. [Warnings of bio-terrorism snipped]

Excerpt from statement on introduction of S.2107, "Electronic
Commerce Enhancement Act," May 21, 1998 :
 The most important benefit of this legislation, however, lies in the
area of electronic innovation. Currently, digital encryption is in a
relatively undeveloped state. One reason for that is the lack of
opportunity for many individuals and companies to make use of the
technology. Another is the lack of a set industry standard. By allowing
use of this technology in the filling out of government paperwork, and
by establishing a standard for digital encryption, the federal
government can open the gates to quick, efficient development of this
technology, as well as its more application throughout the economy. The
benefits to American businesses as they struggle to establish paper-
free workplaces that will lower administrative costs, will be
significant, and will further spur our national economy.

980734.  Special operations commander outlines future threats
by Capt. John Paradis
16th Special Operations Wing Public Affairs
HURLBURT FIELD, Fla. (AFNS) -- More Chechnyas.  If a military strategist
needed to look at a good model for the typical future conflict, the war
torn republic of Chechnya comes to mind, said Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker,
U.S. Special Operations Command commander in chief.
Speaking recently to about 2,000 Hurlburt Field troops at the 55th
Aircraft Maintenance Unit hangar, Schoomaker said the only certainty in
the future of warfare is that security challenges will be more ambiguous
and will follow less traditional paths.
Looking at Chechnya as an example of future conflict, confrontation will
likely differ from the more conventional and familiar "total war" by the
inclination of future adversaries to use "psychological terror" and the
influence of international media, the Internet and even cell phones to
employ open brutality as an information warfare tactic.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, determined to crush the secessionist
drive of the tiny, mainly Muslim southern republic, ordered about 40,000
troops into Chechnya in December 1994.  What was planned as a quick
campaign turned into a long and costly war, in which the outnumbered
rebels time and again dealt heavy blows to a demoralized Russian
It's such "asymmetric" opponents like separatists, rebel groups,
insurgents and terrorists that U.S. special operations forces will need
to prepare for -- enemies who won't attack U.S. strategic strengths, but
will instead target U.S. vulnerabilities by executing unorthodox
measures to gain success, Schoomaker said.
"That's the future.  More Chechnyas," the general said.   "We are going
to see more conflict of this nature because it's a much different world
we're facing."

                Embargoed until 11.00 Friday 29th May
Too often, policy issues relating to information technology are
seperately debated by two distinct grouups: technology experts and
those focused on social concerns.  Policy makers face the challenge of
reconciling the seperate debates in areas where technology is often
evolving very quickly. A new research foundation aims to provide clear
advice that spans this gap and is independent of vested interests.
The Foundation for Information Policy Research will fund research into
how information technology affects society. It is launched at a press
conference on Friday 29th May at 11.00 am. (1)
Microsoft has contributed a six-figure sum to cover the launch costs.
Internet service providers Poptel and Demon are also supporting the
Foundation. Its independence will be guaranteed, however, by a board
of trustees. (2) In the medium term it will be supported by
subscriptions from a range of firms in commerce and industry.
The goal of the Foundation is to promote research and understanding of
the effects, and the likely future effects, of IT on society. Its
areas of investigation include: (3)
 * the regulation of electronic commerce;
 * consumer protection;
 * data protection and privacy;
 * copyright;
 * law enforcement;
 * evidence and archiving;
 * electronic interaction between government, businesses and individuals;
 * the extent to which various information technologies discriminate
   against the less advantaged members of society; and
 * the new risks that computer and communication systems pose to
   life, health and economic well-being
The Foundation will also provide a valuable resource for the press as
it will be able to put journalists in touch with a wide range of
experts who can explain IT issues as they arise.

(and failures) which the current government inherited, and the
decisions which will be made by them in the future, will have
far-reaching effects on who society's winners and losers will be.  We
have a duty to prevent technological innovation and development taking
place at the expense of the poor, the old, the sick and the disabled.
We believe that so long as we understand the social and policy
implications of new technical innovations, we can make IT into a means
to facilitate social inclusion. The Foundation's mission will be to
achieve and to spread that understanding.''
The Managing Director of Microsoft UK, David Svendsen, said: ``It's
important that we contribute to a broad and informed public discussion
on these information society issues.''
The Chair of the Foundation, Ross Anderson of Cambridge University,
said: ``We welcome this new source of funding for IT related
research. An increase in the diversity of funding sources is almost
always a good thing, and the Foundation will be particularly valuable
as much of the available IT funding is directed to very short-term and
narrowly technical agendas.''

The "Millennium Bug" - the problem that many computers cannot deal
correctly with the date roll-over from 1999 to 2000 - threatens to
cause havoc with many systems and has been declared a national
emergency by the Prime Minister.
Another problem that has worried policymakers and concerned citizens
is that new developments in IT may discriminate against the less well
off members of society.  For example, the current mechanisms for
electronic commerce depend on consumers using their credit cards to
order goods and services over the net. They often get a big discount
for buying this way; but people without credit cards may lose out.
The first task that the Foundation has set itself is to examine the
underpinnings of electronic commerce. The European Commission has
recently published a draft Directive on this subject and will launch a
period of public consultation at the same conference at which the
Foundation itself will be launched. (The draft directive is at
Other topics which the Foundation plans to investigate include:
* the maintenance of public records in electronic form. We do not
 fully understand how to ensure that word processor files and other
 electronic documents created today can be safely stored for many
 years, and reliably made available in the future. This affects not
 just the new Freedom of Information Act, but also the work of future
 librarians and historians.
* the development of copyright law. There are some industry proposals
 which would restrict the ability of libraries to lend out digital
 works. Will this mean the end of the public library, as more and more
 books, videos and other material become digital? What are the
 implications for schools and universities? What are the implications
 for the public, if all major sports events in future are pay-per-view?
 Are these developments inevitable, or is there something we can do
 about them?
* the introduction of electronic communication between the citizen and
 the government has the potential to cut queues and the frustration of
 dealing with people on the phone. However, are these changes
 intrinsically more likely to favour the articulate, and to bring the
 most benefit to well-off people with their own computers? What
 technical developments are reasonably possible to ensure that all
 citizens get a fair deal?
* the previous government's proposal for a "personal signature card"
 that would give access to all government services had a distinct
 flavour of an ID card. Are such developments necessary, or can we
 find workable alternatives?
* the police are concerned about the spread of prepaid mobile phones,
 which are increasingly used by stalkers and extortionists. However, if
 they are banned, then how would people without credit cards obtain a
 mobile phone service?
* there have been many disputes in the past over "phantom withdrawals"
 from bank cash machines, and banks have defended themselves by
 claiming that their computers cannot be wrong. How can this approach
 work when millions of merchants are selling services through a wide
 variety of computer systems? What will consumer rights amount to in
 the information age?
* the failure of government computer systems - whether spectacular
 failure due to the millennium bug, or the continuing sporadic
 failures in the NHS - does most harm to pensioners, the disabled,
 single mothers, the unemployed and people on NHS waiting lists (who
 are typically elderly, female and working class). How can we
 encourage best engineering practice in the public sector?

             June 1, 1998              Mr. Kofi Annan              Secretary General              United Nations              New York, New York              United States              Dear Secretary General,              On the occasion of the United Nations General Assembly Special
             Session on Drugs in New York on June 8-10, 1998, we seek your
             leadership in stimulating a frank and honest evaluation of global
             drug control efforts.              We are all deeply concerned about the threat that drugs pose to
             our children, our fellow citizens and our societies. There is no
             choice but to work together, both within our countries and across
             borders, to reduce the harms associated with drugs. The United
             Nations has a legitimate and important role to play in this
             -- but only if it is willing to ask and address tough
questions about
             the success or failure of its efforts.              We believe that the global war on drugs is now causing more
             harm than drug abuse itself.              Every decade the United Nations adopts new international
             conventions, focused largely on criminalization and punishment,
             that restrict the ability of individual nations to devise
             solutions to local drug problems. Every year governments enact
             more punitive and costly drug control measures. Every day
             politicians endorse harsher new drug war strategies.              What is the result? U.N. agencies estimate the annual revenue
             generated by the illegal drug industry at $400 billion, or the
             equivalent of roughly eight per cent of total international
             This industry has empowered organized criminals, corrupted
             governments at all levels, eroded internal security, stimulated
             violence, and distorted both economic markets and moral values.
             These are the consequences not of drug use per se, but of
             decades of failed and futile drug war policies.              In many parts of the world, drug war politics impede public
             efforts to stem the spread of HIV, hepatitis and other infectious
             diseases. Human rights are violated, environmental assaults
             perpetrated and prisons inundated with hundreds of thousands of
             drug law violators. Scarce resources better expended on health,
             education and economic development are squandered on ever
             more expensive interdiction efforts. Realistic proposals to
             drug-related crime, disease and death are abandoned in favor of
             rhetorical proposals to create drug-free societies.              Persisting in our current policies will only result in more drug
             abuse, more empowerment of drug markets and criminals, and
             more disease and suffering. Too often those who call for open
             debate, rigorous analysis of current policies, and serious
             consideration of alternatives are accused of "surrendering." But
             the true surrender is when fear and inertia combine to shut off
             debate, suppress critical analysis, and dismiss all
alternatives to
             current policies. Mr. Secretary General, we appeal to you to
             initiate a truly open and honest dialogue regarding the future of
             global drug control policies - one in which fear, prejudice and
             punitive prohibitions yield to common sense, science, public
             health and human rights. There are a gang of heads of state gathering at the UN, with
cavalcades of limosines and guards racing around Manhattan

[Congressional Record: June 17, 1998 (Senate)]
                               ENCRYPTION
  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today out of concern for our nation's
computer and electronic industries. As you are well aware, the
[[Page S6438]]
export policies prohibit American companies from selling state-of-the-
art encryption technology abroad without recovery keys and back door
access. Encryption is a series of mathematical formulas that scramble
and unscramble data and communications. It is used to thwart computer
hackers, industrial and foreign espionage agents, and criminals from
gaining access to and reading sensitive personal, business, and
military communications. The higher the bit-key length, the more
difficult it is for unauthorized persons to break the code. Technically
advanced encryption ensures that an individual's medical, financial,
business, personal records and electronic-mail cannot be accessed
without their consent. The Administration is now promoting the
deployment of recovery keys so designated third parties would be able
to access and share with law enforcement the computer data and
communications of American citizens without their knowledge. Currently,
government mandated key escrow is not required and is opposed by the
computer industry, privacy advocates, legal scholars, and by many
members of Congress.
  Mr. LEAHY. While current law does not mandate any key recovery, the
current Administration, just as past Administrations, uses the export
control regime to ``dumb down'' the encryption available for widespread
integration into high-tech products intended for both domestic use and
for export to foreign customers. Export regulations in place now are
being used expressly to coerce the development and use of encryption
products capable of giving law enforcement surreptitious access to
plaintext by conditioning the export of 56-bit DES encryption on
development of key recovery features.
  These regulations are scheduled to sunset in December 1998, at which
time export of even 56-bit strength encryption will no longer be
permitted. I understand that the Administration is already undertaking
discussions with industry on what will happen upon sunset of these
regulations. I have long contended that taking unilateral steps will
not resolve this issue, but instead could delay building the consensus
we so urgently need. This issue simply cannot by resolved by Executive
  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I have been involved in the debate
regarding encryption technology and privacy for more than three years
now. In the course of that time I have not seen any real attempt by the
White House to resolve this problem. In fact, over the course of that
time the Administration has moved further from negotiation by taking
increasingly extreme positions on this critical national issue.
  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as you have heard, current U.S. policy
allows only encryption below the 56-bit key length to be sold abroad.
For a long time now, software companies have argued that this level of
encryption is so low it provides little security for the information
being transmitted over the ``super highway.'' This policy also states
that, in the production of encryption stronger than 56-bit, software
companies must provide some type of ``backdoor'' access to ensure law
enforcement can decode encrypted material.
  Addressing this from an economic perspective, customers--especially
foreign customers--are unwilling to purchase American encryption
products with backdoors and third-party access. This is particularly
true since they can buy stronger encryption overseas from either
foreign-owned companies or American owned companies on foreign soil
without these invasive features.
  Mr. WYDEN. Since coming to the Senate, I have worked side-by-side
with Senators Burns, Ashcroft, Leahy and others on the critical issue
of encryption. Our common goal has been to craft a policy that puts the
United States squarely out front of the crypto-curve, rather than locks
us permanently behind it. A one-size-fits-all government policy simply
won't work in this digital era. We all recognize and acknowledge the
legitimate needs of law enforcement and the national security
communities, but tying the hands of America's high technology industry
in the process will serve neither those needs, nor the national
interest in maintaining our competitive edge in the fiercely
competitive global marketplace. It's time to move forward with
comprehensive encryption reform legislation.
  Mr. BURNS. I would like to point out that the government's plan for
encryption--whether they call it ``key escrow'' or ``key recovery'' or
``plaintext access''--simply won't work. Eleven of the world's most
prominent computer security experts have told us government mandated
key recovery won't work because it won't be secure, as explained in a
study published this week by the Center for Democracy and Technology.
Key escrow also won't work because it will cost billions, as revealed
in a recent study published by the Business Software Alliance. We have
also been told that the kind of system the Administration wants is not
technically feasible. Additionally, constitutional scholars testified
that government mandated key escrow, third party recovery probably
violates the Bill of Rights.
  Mr. LOTT. Even though a national recovery system would be technically
unfeasible, costly, and violates an individual's privacy rights, the
Administration continues to require key escrow as a precondition for
relaxing America's encryption policy. Again, Mr. President, I would
point out that state-of-the-art encryption is available in the
international marketplace without key recovery and without backdoor
access. This backdoor door requirement is simply backward thinking
policy. It does not make sense to hold the computer industry hostage to
force the creation of such an unworkable system.
  Mr. BURNS. The Majority Leader is absolutely right. We do not need
experts to tell us key recovery will not work. All that is needed is a
little common sense to understand that no one will buy systems with
backdoor access. Criminals will not escrow their keys and terrorists
will find keyless systems from America's foreign competitors. There is
nothing we can do to stop undesirables from using strong, unescrowed
  Mr. LOTT. Even though advanced encryption products are widely
available across the globe, the White House continues to stall
Congressional and industry attempts to reach a sensible market oriented
solution to the nation's outdated encryption export regime. This
stonewalling tactic will only cede even more of our nation's technology
market to foreign competitors and America will lose forever its ability
to sell encryption technology at home and abroad.
  It is time to change America's export policy before it is too late.
If the Administration will not do what is right, reform its export
regime, then Congress must enact encryption reform during this session.
  Mr. LEAHY. The Majority Leader is correct that reform of our
encryption policy is needed. The Attorney General came to the Hill in
March and asked for a legislative moratorium on encryption matters.
This request was made because the Administration wanted to talk with
the information technology industry about developing means for law
enforcement to gain surreptitious access to plaintext scrambled by
strong encryption. According to eleven of the world's leading
cryptographers in a report reissued on June 8, the technical risks and
costs of such backdoors ``will exacerbate, not alleviate, the potential
for crime and information terrorism'' for America's computer users and
our critical infrastructures.
  In the Senate we have a name for debate that delays action on
legislative matters. We call it a filibuster. On encryption policy, the
Administration has been willing to talk, but not to forge a real
solution. That amounts to a filibuster. The longer we go without a
sensible policy, the more jobs will be lost, the more we risk eroding
our privacy rights on the Internet, and the more we leave our critical
infrastructures vulnerable.
  Mr. BURNS. We can readily see that the current U.S. policy on
encryption jeopardizes the privacy of individuals, the security of the
Internet, and the competitiveness of U.S. industry. We have been
debating this issue since the Administration's introduction of the ill-
fated Clipper chip proposal over five years ago. Yet no substantial
change in Administration policy has taken place. It is time for us to
take action.
  I first introduced comprehensive encryption reform legislation in the
[[Page S6439]]
form of the Pro-CODE bill over two years ago, then reintroduced it in
this Congress with the cosponsorship of the Majority Leader, Senators
Ashcroft, Leahy, Wyden, and others. Along with Senators Ashcroft,
Leahy, and others, I am also an original cosponsor of the E-PRIVACY
bill, which would foster the use of strong encryption and global
competitiveness. We have held numerous hearings on the issue. Yet
despite the increasingly desperate drumbeat of criticism from industry,
individuals, and privacy groups, from across the political spectrum,
the Administration's policy has remained fundamentally unchanged.
  Mr. LEAHY. Since the hearing I chaired in May 1994 on the
Administration's ``Clipper Chip'' proposal, the Administration has
taken some steps in the right direction. Clipper Chip is now dead, and
the Administration has transferred authority over the export of
encryption products from the State Department to the Commerce
Department, as called for in legislation I introduced in the last
Congress with Senators Burns, Wyden and others. Furthermore, the
Administration has permitted the export of up to 56-bit DES encryption,
at least until the end of this year. But these actions are simply not
enough for our high-tech industries to maintain their leading edge in
the global marketplace.
  Mr. ASHCROFT. Our technology companies need to be able to compete
effectively. Without reasonable export laws our technology sector will
be seriously harmed. More encryption companies will leave the country
so they are free to sell their products around the globe as well as
within the United States. Make no mistake, the market will not be
denied. Today, robust encryption products from Canada, Japan, Germany
and elsewhere are being sold on the world market. You have heard of the
companies that are manufacturing and selling encryption. They are
Nortel, Nippon and Seimens. These are not upstart companies. They are
substantial players on the international scene, and they offer
encryption products that are technically and financially competitive
with those produced in the U.S.
  Mr. LOTT. That's right. In fact, a recent survey conducted by Trusted
Information Systems found that hundreds of foreign companies sell over
600 encryption products from 29 countries. It is even possible to
download some of the strongest technology available, 128-bit key length
encryption, off of the Internet. Clearly, America's policy of
restricting the sale of American encryption software and hardware has
not impacted the availability and use of this technology throughout the
  No one disputes the fact that the development and use of robust
encryption worldwide will continue with or without U.S. business
participation. What is particularly disturbing to me is that export
controls, instead of achieving their intended purpose, have only served
to deny America's premier computer industry the opportunity to compete
on a level playing field with foreign competitors. Costing our economy
and our nation billions of dollars and the loss of countless American
jobs in the process. Given the wide availability of encryption
technology, continuing to restrict U.S. access to foreign markets makes
no sense.
  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is absolutely correct. The Administration's
encryption policy is, in effect, a tax on American consumers. We owe it
to these customers and the innovators in the software industry to
reform this encryption policy now. From the birth of the United States,
this country has been a world leader in innovation, creativity,
entrepreneurship, vision and opportunity. Today all of these American
attributes are on display in our technology sector. Whether in
telecommunications, or computer hardware or software, the United States
has maintained a leadership position because of the opportunities
afforded to people with the vision, determination and responsibility to
reach for their highest and best. We must work diligently to ensure
that ample opportunities are maintained in this country for our
technology sector to continue to thrive and innovate. If companies are
stifled and cannot compete, then the people, the ideas, the jobs, and
the economic growth will simply go elsewhere.
  Mr. BURNS. In the computer business these days, they talk about
``Internet time.'' In the Internet industry, where product life cycles
can be as low as 6 months, the world changes rapidly. Yet we have been
debating this issue for over five years now, while America's sensitive
communications go unsecured, our critical information infrastructures
go unprotected, and our electronic commerce jobs get shipped overseas.
It is time for the Congress to act.
  Mr. ASHCROFT. If this issue is not resolved, and resolved soon, we
will lose this industry, we will lose our leadership position in
technology, and our national security will suffer. We have a choice to
make as policy makers--do we allow our companies to compete
internationally or do we force them, by our antiquated and ill-
conceived government policy, to move overseas. We cannot simply ignore
the reality that robust encryption exists in the international
marketplace now. Instead, we must allow our companies to compete, and
do so now. We cannot allow extraneous issues to stand in the way of
remedying the deficiencies with our current approach to encryption. We
must recognize that keeping the encryption industry on American shores
is the best way to ensure national security. We would not think of
allowing all our defense industries to move abroad. By the same token,
we should not force the encryption industry abroad through outdated
policies. Simply put, strong encryption means a strong economy and a
strong country. This concern is just one of the many reasons we need to
pass effective encryption legislation this year and just one of the
reasons that Senator Leahy and I recently drafted the E-PRIVACY bill,
S. 2067.
  Mr. LEAHY. I join with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in
calling for passage of good encryption legislation that promotes
computer privacy, fosters the global competitiveness of our high-tech
industries, and encourages the widespread use of strong encryption as
an online crime prevention and anti-terrorism tool. The E-PRIVACY bill
that I have sponsored with Senator Ashcroft, Senator Burns and others,
satisfies these goals. Prompt Senate consideration of encryption
legislation is sorely needed to protect America's economy and security.
  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the E-PRIVACY bill seeks to protect
individual privacy, while at the same time addressing national security
and law enforcement interests. It would also modernize export controls
on commercial encryption products.
  The E-Privacy Act specifically addresses the concerns of law
enforcement. First and foremost, it makes it a crime to intentionally
use encryption to conceal incriminating communications or information.
It also provides that with an official subpoena, existing wiretap
authority can be used to obtain communications decryption keys/
assistance from third parties.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Leahy, Senator
Burns and Senator Ashcroft as well as Senator Lott and Senator Daschle
for their work and leadership on the issue of encryption. I am proud to
be an original cosponsor of S. 2067, the E-PRIVACY Act.
  This is my sixth year as a member of the Senate and the sixth year I
have advocated for reasonable legislation on encryption. Sadly, the
Administration has not been a constructive player in this debate. It is
time for the United States to acknowledge that we no longer exclusively
control the pace of technology. Purchasers around the world can
download software off of the Internet from any country by simply
accessing a website. Foreign purchasers have turned to Russian, German,
Swiss and other foreign vendors for their encryption needs.
  Washington state and American companies deserve the opportunity to
compete free from unreasonable government restrictions. Their role in
the international marketplace should be determined by their ingenuity
and creativity rather than an outdated, ineffectual system of export
controls. The time to act is now. I urge the Senate to consider the E-
PRIVACY Act at the earliest opportunity.
  Mr. BURNS. The basic facts remain the same. People need strong,
unescrowed encryption to protect themselves online in the information
[[Page S6440]]
age. Law enforcement has legitimate concerns about the spread of this
technology, and we must work to provide them the tools and expertise
they need to keep up with advances in encryption technology. We cannot
stop time, however. The genie is out of the bottle. As Bill Gates, the
CEO of Microsoft, recently said, ``Encryption technology is widely
available outside the United States and inside the United States, and
that's just a fact of life.''
  Mr. CRAIG. With the rapid expansion of the ``super highway'' and
Internet commerce it is crucial we bring encryption legislation to the
forefront. A secure, private and trusted national and global
information infrastructure is essential to promote citizens' privacy
and economic growth.
  Mr. BURNS. As my colleagues recognize, technically advanced and
unobtrusive encryption is fundamental to ensuring the kind of privacy
Americans will need and desire in the years to come. Congress must
choose a future where individuals and companies will have the tools
they need to protect their privacy, not a future where people fear the
use electronic commerce because they have no security.
  I commend the Majority Leader, Senators Ashcroft, Leahy, Craig,
Wyden, and Murray for their vision and bipartisan leadership on this
issue. I hope that Congress will be able to move forward with real
encryption reform legislation that protects the privacy and security of
Americans in the Information Age, before it is too late.
  Mr. LOTT. I think it is worth repeating to my colleagues that the
Administration's approach to encryption makes no sense. It is not good
policy. Continuing to restrict the foreign sale of American encryption
technology that is already available abroad, or will soon be available,
is anti-business, anti-consumer, anti-jobs, and anti-innovation.
  The time for a change in America's export regime is long overdue.
Unfortunately, the Administration continues to support its outmoded and
competition-adverse encryption control policy. That is why this
Congress needs to find a legislative solution to this issue.
  If America's export controls are not relaxed now, then Congress
places in peril our entire technology industry. Not just those
companies that create and market encryption products and services, but
virtually every company involved in the development and sale of
computer hardware and software. Congress cannot and will not put
America's entire technological base at risk for an ineffective and
outmoded export policy on encryption.

Most officials in Asia seem to have accepted the virtues of transparency, at least in the economic field.

Nevertheless, no matter how small, efficient, or cost-effective surveillance hardware becomes, there will always be limits to what technology can accomplish. Indeed, it is a double-edged sword--witness the polemics in Washington and on the Web over who, if anyone, should regulate electronic encryption. From untappable communications to pixel-by-pixel photo and video editing, technology is often as good at hiding secrets as it is at revealing them. Without a norm of transparency, technology will continue to protect private information as well as ferret it out.

IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 23, 1998
           ENCRYPTION FORMULAS DECLASSIFIED
The Department of Defense today announced the decision by the National Security Agency to declassify both the Key Exchange Algorithm and the SKIPJACK encryption algorithm used in the FORTEZZA(tm) personal computer card. FORTEZZA(tm) provides security at the desktop in the Defense Message System and other DoD applications. This marks the first time that the NSA has declassified such information and made it commercially available. This declassification is an essential part of the Department of Defense's efforts to work with commercial industry in developing reasonably priced computer protection products. This declassification decision will enable industry to develop software and smartcard based security products, which are interoperable with FORTEZZA(tm). The availability of such products will enhance the protection of DoD's sensitive but unclassified and critical non-mission communications. The decision to release SKIPJACK (an 80 bit encryption algorithm that is not extensible to higher key lengths) and KEA (a 1024 bit key exchange algorithm) is restricted to these particular algorithms, and does not apply to other classified NSA algorithms. The SKIPJACK and KEA algorithms and their source codes have been declassified pursuant to Executive Order 12958.

CIA Head Forsees Better Hackers
Filed at 5:43 p.m. EDT
By The Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Intrusion into government computers will become increasingly more sophisticated and better organized and is likely to involve hostile nations, CIA Director George Tenet told lawmakers Wednesday. "Potential attackers range from national intelligence and military organizations, terrorists, criminals, industrial competitors, hackers and disgruntled or disloyal insiders," Tenet told the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee. "We know with specificity of several nations that are working on developing an information warfare capability." While Tenet did not identify the countries, committee Chairman Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who received a classified briefing on Tuesday, named some of them. Citing published reports, Thompson said China, Russia, Libya, Iraq and Iran and at least seven other countries are developing information warfare programs. The challenge facing U.S. intelligence will be to detect attacks on U.S.computers and information systems by organized or individual hackers. In some cases, Tenet said, disruptive intrusions orchestrated by hostile states may be disguised as amateurish efforts by individual hackers. "Our electric power grids and our telecommunications networks will be targets of the first order," Tenet said. "An adversary capable of implanting the right virus or accessing the right terminal can cause massive damage." The shift of the computer hacker problem from individuals and terrorist groups to governments is only beginning, Tenet said, but he added, "Down the line we are going to encounter more and it will be more organized." Tenet cited one case, without naming it, of a foreign government targeting the United States for intrusion into information systems. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., asked if the U.S. government is taking steps to develop its own offensive hacking capability to disrupt adversaries and to serve as a deterrent for computer-based attacks. "We're not asleep at the switch in this regard," Tenet replied. Air Force Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minihan, head of the National Security Agency, said it was not going too far to think in terms of an "electronic Pearl Harbor," a well-organized assault on the United States based on strikes aimed at electronic information systems. The most sensitive information centers, such as CIA and Pentagon classified files, are heavily guarded against such intrusion and, in most cases, are fenced off from Internet-type transfers. The problems are more likely to
arise in less well-guarded areas such as financial networks or industrial control centers. "They're not going to attack our strengths," Minihan said. A key area of vulnerability within the intelligence community, Tenet said, is the possibility of a disloyal or disgruntled employee wreaking havoc with CIA computers. Another scenario stems from the difficulty the CIA is
encountering finding enough software specialists to grapple with the "Year 2000" problem, caused by computers not being programmed to recognize the shift in the calendar from 1999 to 2000. Most of the contractors available to help the agency, Tenet said, would use foreigners, affording "an easy opportunity to come in and see how your system works and what your vulnerabilities are." The running debate over the availability of increasingly sophisticated encryption technology, which scrambles messages and data from unauthorized intrusion, also poses a worry, Tenet said. Unless the computer industry and the government find a legislative compromise, the government could fall victim to hackers able to hide their own actions in impenetrable encryption codes. It may take a major computer-hacker incident to create the political pressure needed to allow
the government the "recovery" power to access encrypted databases. "There is a train wreck waiting to happen unless we deal with the recovery aspect of the encryption debate," Tenet said.

NYT, June 27, 1998:
Getting Back to Basics, C.I.A. Is Hiring More Spies Taking steps to reduce dependence on high-tech spying. By James Risen
Washington, June 26--The Central Intelligence Agency is beginning the largest recruitment drive for new spies in its history, in an ambitious effort to rebuild its espionage service, which has been severely damaged by spy scandals, budget cutbacks and high turnover since the end of the cold war, officials said.
With Congress already providing increased financing, the Directorate of Operations, the C.I.A.'s clandestine espionage arm, will hire record numbers of case officers
--spies-- beginning this year as part of a new strategic plan to repair the decaying espionage capabilities of the United States by 2005, officials said. In addition to expanded hiring, the agency also plans to reopen several overseas stations that were closed in the early 1990's after the demise of the Soviet Union led Congress and the White House to reduce the C.I.A.'s budget sharply. The recruitment plan is a sign that the C.I.A. recognizes that it has become far too dependent on so-called technical intelligence, or eavesdropping devices and spy satellites. Now, the agency wants to get back to espionage basics, by increasing its ability to place a spy behind enemy lines or inside the offices of a rival government. The spread of new technologies like encryption and computer networks has eroded the value of spy satellites and listening devices and has led the C.I.A. to see the need for an expanded cadre of spies. Without having an agent in place, the C.I.A. has found it much harder to gain access to secrets from rival governments, terrorists and international organized crime groups.  ...
The C.I.A. is recruiting case officers, and people to support them with technical skills that spies have rarely been asked to learn in the past. "As we tried to figure out our requirements for the future, we realized we needed to have greater technical support for agent operations," said one American official. At the top of the list of requirements is computer expertise. The proliferation of global computer data networks, for example, has made it more difficult for the agency to slip into a country using false identifications. Only computer experts can defeat those local computer systems, and even developing countries routinely make sophisticated computer checks on passports and visas. ...

Ireland listened to its many resident technology companies, rather than bowing to pressure from the US, which wants access to encrypted messages. Ireland places no
restrictions on the use, import or export of encryption
products. Individuals can choose to offer a plain text version of the encrypted document or hand over a key, if a search warrant is proffered. The document was released to coincide with the Irish visit of President Clinton's Internet tsar, senior trade advisor Ira Magaziner, who hinted that his views on encryption diverge from those of his boss. "Within the next year, there'll be such an availability of high-level encryption that the market will take over," he said.

   Rowlett was one of three earliest recruits of William Friedman,
head of the the US Army Signal Intelligence Service, a 1930s forerunner of NSA's "massive cryptologic system today" (Kahn). After a long career in Army cryptology Rowlett served with the CIA and was special assistant to the DIRNSA at the end of his service in the 1960s.
He is credited with helping to break the Japanese RED and PURPLE codes, efforts unlerlying the Allies World War II MAGIC cryptanalysis system.
He was also an inventor, following work of others, of the
SIGABA machine, the US Army's version of Hebern's cipher device, and  held other cryptologic patents.

Maybe you know that the FBI offers about 256 pages of
docouments related to Nikola Tesla on its FOIA Web site:
   HTTP://
They are in two large PDF files of 4.8MB and 5.8MB.
In case you've not seen them here's a brief:
None of the papers are by Tesla himself, and most
relate to various inquiries about Tesla's "missing papers,"
based on O'Neil's book claim that the FBI confiscated Tesla's papers and effects shortly after his death. The FBI claims that it was the Alien Property Office which had Tesla's effects and that the FBI had not been involved.
Several focus on Tesla's famous "Death Ray" of the 1940s,
with requests for access to the scientific papers on it, or
warn of its possible use by foreign enemies. To most the
FBI sends a standard disavowal.
However, one is of interest: a Feb 1981 inquiry by the Defense Department which stated in a then-classified "(C) We believe that certain of Tesla's papers may contain
basic principles which would be of considerable value to
ongoing research within the DoD."
The FBI answers that it never had Tesla's papers but reports that a review of those at the Alien Property Office by an MIT scientific team found that none of the papers contained significant scientific information of national
security interest. Yet, the FBI goes on, the Alien Property Office told the FBI in the 1950s that in the only recorded visit to the Tesla archive in January 1943 (shortly after
Tesla's death) an unidentified "Federal authority" microfilmed numerous papers, film whose whereabouts
the FBI knows nothing.
There's a bit more about electronic research at Wright Paterson AFB. And a DoD thank you letter on behalf of Dr. S. L. Zeiburg, Deputy Undersecretary
(Strategic and Space Systems).
A once-secret 1983 series investigated a claim that Margaret Cheney's biography of Tesla, "Tesla: Man Out of Time,"  points to national security threats based on allegations of Soviet development of his experiments using papers possibly obtained through his nephew, Sava Kosanovic, a high Yugoslav official. Many pages of Cheney's book marked at threatening passages on the "missing papers" are in the file.

   Editorial
   Privacy in the Digital Age
   As more and more Americans communicate and do business
   electronically, the fear is spreading that information they
   transmit can be seized by hackers or criminals and used for
   illegal or unsavory purposes. Fortunately, the technology
   to thwart such invasions already exists. It is called
   encryption, or the encoding of digital information to
   secure its privacy. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation
   is trying hard to prevent the growing use of encryption,
   both in the United States and abroad, because of fears that
   the protective technology itself will get into the wrong
   hands. That shortsighted stand will undermine efforts to
   protect commercial transactions and may actually hamper law
   enforcement rather than help it.
   The Clinton Administration's current policies toward
   encryption have been largely dictated by the F.B.I. and the
   Justice Department. These two agencies now block encryption
   makers from exporting their most advanced technology unless
   they agree to develop a method allowing law enforcement
   agencies to gain access to it. The method favored by the
   F.B.I. is known as the key escrow, in which the key to
   cracking a code is kept with a third party that could hand
   it over quickly if law enforcement agencies demanded it.
   But the key escrow method poses tremendous threats to
   privacy. There is a danger that access to keys for the code
   could be abused by law enforcement agencies and others.
   Worse, the United States would be required to share key
   escrow information with law enforcement agencies of other
   countries, and giving access to private communications to
   countries with poor human rights records could lead to
   crackdowns on dissidents using encryption for their own
   communications.
   According to industry officials, the export controls are
   already backfiring. More and more foreign companies are
   supplying encryption technologies without key escrow
   arrangements, making it virtually impossible for the F.B.I.
   to eavesdrop and stealing business from American firms. The
   growing foreign role diminishes the ability of the F.B.I.
   to demand new safeguards or ways to penetrate the
   communications of criminals who use encryption.
   President Clinton might normally be more sympathetic to
   concerns over maintaining privacy in the digital world. But
   since Attorney General Janet Reno has protected Mr. Clinton
   from an independent counsel on campaign finance, the White
   House is said to be loath to oppose either her or Louis
   Freeh, the F.B.I. Director, on this issue.
   On Capitol Hill, the debate over encryption has created
   some unusual political alliances. Many conservative
   Republicans have stood with leaders of the high-tech
   industry to oppose any kind of ban on encryption within the
   United States and to support a loosening of export controls
   on encryption technology. It has been odd to see Trent
   Lott, the Senate majority leader, and Dick Armey, the House
   majority leader, stand with civil libertarians against the
   demands of the F.B.I. But the F.B.I. is not without
   influence. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, more friendly to
   the agency, has prevented a bill encouraging greater use of
   encryption from coming to a vote in the House.
   The concerns of law enforcement agencies are legitimate.
   But smart criminals are already using encryption, some of
   which is readily available on the Internet. That was the
   message conveyed only a few weeks ago by such unlikely
   allies as Bill Gates of Microsoft and Jim Barksdale of
   Netscape, who are on opposite sides in the Justice
   Department's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft but agree
   on this issue.
   The F.B.I. should give up its losing fight against
   encryption and work with industry to develop new means to
   catch criminals who use it. One approach under discussion
   would be to develop software technology that could be
   surreptitiously placed in a suspect's computer to capture
   keystrokes before they are encrypted. Any such operation
   would have to be carried out under strict court control as
   the electronic equivalent of a search warrant. But law
   enforcement agencies have to find a legal and ethical way
   to stay ahead of technology, rather than stand in the way
   of it. Trying to block advances in the digital age is
   futile.

We've transcribed a fax of Senator Thompson's
Amendment as Substitute for S.712, "Government
Secrecy Reform Act of 1998," passed by the
Governmental Affairs Committee on June 17:
     (37K)
Here's a report on the amendment and vote:
NCC Washington Update, vol. 4,  July 1, 1998
[National Coordinating Committee for the Promotion of History]
Senate Committee Adopts Substitute Bill for
Moynihan's Government Secrecy Reform Act
Senate Committee Adopts Substitute Bill for Moynihan's Government
Secrecy Reform Act -- On June 17 the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
met to consider a substitute bill for S.712, the Government Secrecy Reform
Act of 1998.  By voice vote, with no negative votes heard, the Committee
passed the substitute bill proposed by Senator Fred Thompson (R-TENN), the
chair of the Committee, and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME).  The original
bill had provided a framework for reform but had lacked the specifics
which this bill provides.
The substitute bill make four major changes from the bill that was
originally introduced.  First, this bill eliminates the section calling
for the establishment of a National Declassification Center in an existing
agency -- which many had thought could be the National Archives -- and
instead expands the functions and oversight responsibilities of the
existing Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) and moves that
office from the National Archives to the Executive Office of the
President.  Second, the bill states that classified information must be
declassified after 25 years unless, as the bill summary states,
"extraordinary circumstances" require that it remain classified.  The
original bill had a 30 year time limit for most information to remain
classified.  Third, the substitute bill retains the balancing test of the
original bill; however, the revised bill establishes criteria to guide
agency classification decisions for weighing the concerns of national
security and the public interest in disclosure.  The national security
criteria are taken directly from President Clinton's E.O 12958 and the
public interest criteria are newly developed for the substitute bill.
Fourth, the substitute bill establishes a Classification and
Declassification Review Board composed of 5 public members to hear agency
and individual appeals regarding classification and declassification
Once the report for the amended S. 712 is filed, which is expected to
happen in mid-July, then the substitute bill will be referred to the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for 30 days for their
consideration.  It is anticipated that the Intelligence Committee may hold
hearings and may have objections to the balancing test provision of the
bill.  Since there appears to be little attention in the House to this
legislation and since there are not many legislative days remaining before
adjournment, it is doubtful that this legislation will pass in the 105th

U.S. to Ease Limits on Export of Data-Scrambling Technology
By Elizabeth Corcoran
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, July 7, 1998; Page E04 Commerce Secretary William Daley plans to announce today
that the government will give U.S. software companies new
freedom to export their most sophisticated data-scrambling
technology to financial institutions chartered in 45 countries,
according to Clinton administration sources.
Under the new rules, which officials said are likely to take
effect in late summer, eligible banks, securities firms,
brokerage houses and credit-card companies will need to
receive approval only once from the Commerce Department
before they can license the most sophisticated "encryption," or
data-scrambling, technology.
Once they receive approval, those institutions will be
permitted to share the technology with any of their branch
offices, except for those located in terrorist states.
Government sources estimate that the new rules will include
about 70 percent of the world's banks, including the 100
largest (ranked by assets).
For years, the government has closely regulated export of
encryption software, on the grounds that terrorists or hostile
governments might use it to cloak their communications. The
software industry argues that the rules are unworkable and
unfairly block foreign sales. Unfriendly parties wanting to use
encryption already can obtain it overseas, industry executives
The new rules on banks are "a move in the right direction,"
said one industry executive familiar with the regulations. "But
we're still leaving some groups out. Basically, we need to keep
spreading the circle wider," to include the growing number of
businesses offering financial services, such as insurance
"What we've heard sounds great," said Kawika Daguio, a
lobbyist for the American Bankers Association. "We've been
arguing [for several years] that the regulatory structure we
have guarantees we're good citizens" who wouldn't make illicit
use of the technology, he said.
Now the government appears to have agreed.
Current regulations require that U.S. companies apply for
permits before exporting anything but the simplest versions of
encryption products. To export more sophisticated
technology, organizations must have a plan for creating
so-called "spare keys." That way, law enforcement officials
who have obtained a court order would be able to unlock the
In May 1997, the Commerce Department said it would not
restrict the sophistication of the data-encryption technology
sold to financial institutions. But it required spare keys and
case-by-case licensing. Approvals have been slow. Now the
government is doing away with the key requirement, defining
more precisely which financial institutions qualify and pledging
to end case-by-case approval.
Because of concerns about money laundering, the government
will grant the new permission only to financial institutions
chartered in countries that have agreed to take steps against
money-laundering. If U.S. companies want to sell to financial
institutions chartered in other countries, they will have to
apply for licenses from the Commerce Department.
Such provisions still fall short of the demands of U.S.
companies. "To take a piecemeal approach [to loosening
encryption restrictions] is the wrong direction," said Ed
Gillespie, executive director of Americans for Computer
Privacy, a lobbying group. "We need a blanket lifting of
restrictions with individual prohibitions," such as bans on
sending such technology to terrorist states, he said.
In a related development, a federal court in Ohio ruled on
Friday that posting the text of an encryption program on the
Internet, where people all over the world could see it, was not
protected by the constitutional right to free speech.
The ruling, made late Friday, contradicts a ruling made by a
California district court last August. Privacy advocates predict
that the issue will be taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court. (c) Copyright 1998 The Washington Post Company

to voters.
Amazing that the NYT sent up that trial balloon for
government access to key strokes in lieu of GAK.
Who's pushing that, working on the technology?

Software Publishers Are Not Protected by the First Amendment
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
To be added to, or removed from, the list of those who were sent this
press release, please send e-mail to .
     _________________________________________________________________
Cleveland, Ohio, July 8 -- On July 3, 1998 Judge Gwin of the United States District Court of the
Northern District of Ohio held that computer programs are not writings
protected by the constitution because they are ``inherently
functional'' and granted summary judgment dismissing a suit
challenging regulations that forbid the publication of encryption
programs on the Internet or the World Wide Web.
The suit was brought by Peter Junger, a law professor at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland, to enjoin the enforcement of export
regulations on encryption software that prevent him from publishing
his class materials and articles for his course in Computing and the
Law on the Internet because they contain some encryption programs.  Junger claimed in his suit that those encryption programs were
writings that were entitled to the full protection of the First
Amendment.  ``Of course they are writings,'' Junger says, ``I know
because I wrote some of them.  And I need to be able to publish them
if I am ever going to be able to explain to lawyers and law students
how computers work and how the law should be applied to computing.''
The government, on the other hand, argued that its export regulations,
which require that one obtain a license from the Commerce Department
before publishing materials containing encryption software on the
Internet or the World Wide Web, seek only to restrict the distribution
of encryption software itself, not ideas on encryption.  And Judge
Gwin agreed with the government, finding that: ``the Export
Regulations are constitutional because encryption source code is
inherently functional, because the Export Regulations are not directed
at source code's expressive elements, and because the Export
Regulations do not reach academic discussions of software, or software
in print form.''
In a related case in California brought by mathematics professor
Daniel Bernstein, Federal District Court Judge Patel held that
computer programs are speech that is protected by the First Amendment,
but Judge Gwin rejected that argument, saying: ``The Bernstein court's
assertion that `language equals protected speech' is unsound. `Speech'
is not protected simply because we write it in a language.''  It is
Judge Gwin's position that computer source code is a purely functional
device: ``The court in Bernstein misunderstood the significance of
source code's functionality. Source code is `purely functional,' in a
way that the Bernstein Court's examples of instructions, manuals, and
recipes are not.  Unlike instructions, a manual, or a recipe, source
code actually performs the function it describes. While a recipe
provides instructions to a cook, source code is a device, like
embedded circuitry in a telephone, that actually does the function of
There is thus a clear split between the two courts: Judge Patel
holding that computer software is protected by the First Amendment and
Judge Gwin holding that it isn't.  The Bernstein case is on appeal and
Professor Junger says that he intends to appeal Judge Gwin's decision:
``We have had almost no financial support for this case, but the issue
of whether encryption software and software in general is protected
like other writings under the First Amendment, or whether it is to be
treated as a special exception like obscenity and fighting words as Judge
Gwin held, is so important that we will have to scrape up the
resources somehow to bring an appeal.''
Judge Gwin's opinion is now available at and is mirrored at .

@_subject: Covert Access to Data and ID 
Dave Emery's remarks on government access to
keystrokes (proposed by the NYT as an alternative
to GAK) points to the probable increase of intrusive
devices to counter increasing use of encryption
and other privacy and anonymity measures.
This topic comes up here now and then, with
mentions of a slew of methods to protect privacy of data during transmission or storage. But the possibility
of logging the initial creation or manipulation of data is
not as often discussed, nor how to tie a person to
the data, as now being asked in legal and law
enforcement fora to identify, catch, convict and
jail computer culprits.
That the NYT floated the idea surely means someone
is testing public response to an idea that seems to
be more intrusive than GAK: the logging of initial
data and any manipulation of it, prior to encrypting,
and maybe including a means to link the actions to
the user.
If this is logging (and related retrieval) is done covertly, encryption could thereby become a falsely reassuring cloak of privacy.
Dave thinks devices like these are surely in the works,
and he can say more about their sponsors, technologies and implementations.
One driving force, as he previously noted, is the desire
for devices to assure copyright protection, backed by the WIPO treaty, which now being considered for approval. See the House report on it at:
     (141K)
And the EFF and ACLU opposition to it:
   hr2281-opp.htm
Other forces, though, are employers who want to snoop,
law enforcement, government, marketers, actually the
same groups who dislike privacy protection measures,
but often prefer to snoop covertly while loudly proclaiming
support for privacy.
Thus, the more general question Dave has raised is how
widespread is the development and implementation of
technolgies for covert surveillance on the Web and in desktop boxes -- happily spreading quietly while attention is focussed on the very encryption which it will circumvent?
And what are these devices, or what might they be, what might be countermeasures and who might be working for and against them. SDA must have insights to share.

Forwarded from a long-time cpunk who received a call from Jim Bell yesterday. Jim asked that this message be By this post he is publically accusing the Federal Government of having spied on him from two physical addresses.  These are two houses to the North & to the East of his parent's house.  The government moved in within 6 months (approx) of the time before his arrest.
One of the addresses is 7217 Mississippi, which is listed as "Billy King", who died a couple of years ago.  The  house is ostensibly being occupied by his widow (or that is the
impression).  It is listed as being as owned by Alverna King, but he has his doubts.
The other is address is 7302 Corregidor, purchased about 2.5 - 3 years ago by someone. Listed as being the address of Sundown Development, a small business company.  A second floor was added soon after it was acquired by the company.  They aren't listed as the owners on record, but they are listed as being at that address.  Thinks this is a sham.
The govmt was basically next door spying on him for at least a year, before it started provoking him.  In response to his using the internet for freewheeling debate, they engaged in some bugging that is illegal under Washington State law.  It is illegal to use bugging without the knowledge of the participants.
He has developed a technique for identifying when someone is tailing him.  Found this on Father's day when some people got a little too close to him.  He drove to his Sister's party on Hayden Island in Oregon, and noticed the tails.  Identified them as Rixen Marine, which he thinks is a sham, another front organization.  One of the reasons he was arrested (though they're not willing to admit it) is because was way too successful in tailing _them_.  A few more days and he would have blown their entire operation.
He couldn't go into the details of how he found out these things. Did research & sophisticated observation. Will be getting friends to do searches in databases, etc. to gather more info to substantiate his suspicions.
He said his recent arrest was on a probation violation charge - failure to pay a fine or something, wasn't clear on the specifics.  There will be a hearing on his case this Friday the 10th.
Prosecutors last year didn't know what the govmt was up to - not told of the spying (a "black operation").  Their method of spying on him are techniques which are possible, though rarely used.  If people knew they would be very surprised.  It will be a big story - big as Watergate - when it comes out.  Their usage of these high-tech methods for access is difficult, so not used often.    The government is trying to cover up their reaction to what he wrote in his essays.

code is verified by routines embedded in the BIOS and will allegedly use
some subset of X.509v3 and PKCS
As so often happens in circumstances like this I can't risk passing

DoD released today the text of a June 11 speech which
describes how the military is planning for the first time
in US history to establish a homeland defense command,
to operate inside US borders for protection against terrorism
and weapons of mass destruction:
   A special unit will handle cyber threats.
The CINC-US will be a vast increase over the traditional
role of domestic law enforcement by FBI, ATF and other
federal, state and local authorities, lately supplemented
by the National Guard, FEMA, PCCIP, and the newly
formed COIA at Commerce and the President's special office on domestic terrorism.
Deputy Secretary of Defense Hamre said the command
will work with the newly formed Defense Threat Reduction
Agency (DTRA) which will be under C4I of DoD.
Another press release today covered Hamre's June 22 speech in Vienna where he outlined similar measures for European defense through NATO:
   Finally, the Wash Post had a report today on DoD's
attempt to come up with workable plans for offensive
cyberwar -- which is claimed to be the serious first serious competitor for the nuclear threat in fifty years:
   It says that a component of cyberwar offense is regular prowling
of other countries networks and military command systems for the purpose of "pre-planning the battlefield."
That this is the way DoD justifies ignoring the limitations of intel agencies' need to get presidential approval for invading the borders of other countries. "Cyberspace is borderless," says the Pentagon.
Many covert prowling, surveilling and crashing tools
are in operation or poised to take down systems like those
of the nuclear command and control systems of Pakistan and India should the need arise. One guy
brags that any one of a dozen experts in the US "could take out a country in six hours" by disrupting
cyber infrastructure, and that might be looming for
the US.

"my megaherz-death bombers are sneakier than yours"?

Remarks by Deputy Secretary of Defense John J. Hamre
Commemorating the 200th Anniversary of the Recall of George Washington to Active Duty
Mount Vernon, Virginia
Saturday, July 4, 1998
Two hundred years ago, Washington was called back to service to prepare America's defenses.  Today, the American homeland faces a new and different danger.  The threat is not from overt invasion, but from the sinister dangers of chemical, biological and cyber warfare.  Chemical and biological weapons are a poor man's atomic bomb.  They are easier to build, to hide, and to deliver to their targets.  They are especially appealing to small terrorist cells and known individuals who can not challenge American military superiority on the battlefield.
As in Washington's time, America is not yet fully prepared for this new challenge. We too must organize, plan, and act anew. We too must recognize that complacency and delay is dangerous. President Clinton and Secretary of Defense Cohen have made preparing the American homeland against chemical and biological weapons a top priority.  The continental United States has not confronted a direct threat to its territory in this century precisely because we have confronted threats before they touched our shores.  But this is a new era, where adversaries can bring their fight to our doorstep.  National security now must assume a new dimension.
The Department of Defense and the intelligence community must work hand in hand with law enforcement to deal with this far-reaching threat.  We are taking steps to improve our knowledge of hostile elements and their plans.  We are reorganizing the Defense Department to integrate our approach to counter-proliferation of these terrible new weapons, and we are launching new programs to help local emergency response forces to mitigate the effects of chemical and biological attack.
Shortly, we will commemorate this day by planting a new tree, adding to Washington's beloved "shades of Mount Vernon."  We place it here as a mark of gratitude to a leader who accepted the burdens of public service to defend our young republic.  We also place it here to mark our commitment to ensure future generations will live in peace and security.  One hundred years from now we will not be here, but I hope Americans will gather under this tree to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Washington's act of patriotic sacrifice.  And I hope they will also say, of us, that we too left a measure of our day and, by our deeds, we too preserved the safety of this sweet land of liberty.
Thank you all for coming today.

The New York Times, July 12, 1998:
Danger of Encryption
To the Editor:
Re "Privacy in the Digital Age" (editorial, July 6): No law enforcement agency is "trying hard to prevent the growing use of encryption." But encryption represents a serious public safety concern. We are open to any solution that recognizes that it is the ability to collect electronic evidence that has allowed us to prevent airliners from being bombed and to put major drug dealers behind bars.
Key escrow is one possible solution. There are others, and certainly a statutory scheme can be devised that will all but eliminate any risk of abuse by law enforcement. But if we do not allow for court-ordered access, for the first time in the history of this country a court order for seizure of evidence will be an absolute nullity.
We want to work with industry on a real solution, recognizing that those who acquire encryption over the Internet or from abroad naively make assumptions about the security it affords. We are not fighting encryption, but we know what will happen if technology cannot be made to work for law enforcement as it works for criminals and terrorists.    Louis J. FREEH

Question: What happened to the encryption device that was aboard the
failed INTELSAT launch in 1996?
Answer: The U.S. personnnel present searched the site for two days after the launch failure. Despite extremely hazardous conditions that made recovery very difficult, the U.S. personnel believed that they recovered all recoverable U.S. parts and components that survived the launch No identifiable parts or components associated with the Telemetry Tracking and Control Encryption devices [TT&C], and the circuit board on which it was mounted, were recovered. We have been advised by Loral that the devices were embedded on a tray mounted within the Command Processor Box  of the satellite. lf this is the case, it is highly unlikely that the devices survived the crash because of the crash impact and high temperatures produced by the burning rocket propellants. According to Loral, the Command Processor Box was located adjacent to the propellant tanks and U.S. personnel at the site recovered only 30% of the box.
The COMSEC circuit board consisted of a printed wiring board and forty
plus, off-the-shelf and semi-custom discrete small sca]e integrated circuit chips. The COMSEC board is somewhat large and relatively fragile (about 6x10 inches), with interconnecting "tracks" on the board which interconnect the many logic devices into the COMSEC algorithm. As such a whole circuit board, its whole composite set of pieces, and the whole set of logic chips need to be recovered to succeed in reengineering the design of the device. If Loral's assessment of the physical implementation of the two COMSEC devices aboard INTELSAT 708 and the extent of damage to the command processor from the crash, impact and fire are correct, NSA and DTSA believe that it is highly unlikely that these items could have been recovered in sufficient detail to reverse In the unlikely event that the Chinese were able to recover all the items fully intact, it is important to note that the encryption board involved many embedded devices. Any loss of the chips and associated encryption algorithm would have have only minimal impact on national security because the INTELSAT 708 satellite was uniquely keyed.

This is fact, not the media kind: I've tried to reach Dimitri
by phone a few times since Termination, indeed Mr. T.
helped me find a working number (forwarded to his own). A lady sounding like Guy there took my name, number and request for DM to call. But he hasn't. He just keeps posting
as Guy, as Tim, as Nuri, muliple Adams, Johns, Jims, Peters,
anons, and  so on, each of the imposters posing as others.
Remember this fact, Tim/Dimitri were in cahoots to nuke the legacy toaderpunks from day one, pretending to be halves
of evil twins. (Note the overlapping name spelling.)
Still, shifting back to media, the five of us in Manhattan --
Perry, Dimitri, Guy, Duncan (Ray's in Brooklyn -- hundreds more don't openly affinity) hate each other's guts with infinite passion as is the duty of citizens competing for dole here, especially since 20 millions of us are on the dole, thank you Mr. Roosevelt for legalizing taxing/extoriting/wall streeting
the rest of the globe beyond the Hudson and Fire Island, from itzy-ritzy bankers to scum of the media sapoid. Primarily, though, our full-time role is to hide from each other and the vengeful planet, have our machines say things like, speak to my agent, my lawyer, my mate, then flip a switch
to the voice of the referent saying things like, he's not in, he's traveling, he's away, his son's just been killed skiing, he'll get back, cackle like Freddie.
Shifting back to fact: Dimitri's lady who took my name was:
Dimitri, Guy, Perry, Duncan, Ray, any of Dimitri's manifold
enemies and friends, any of you. Who knows who's here?
Nothing I've seen proves cypherpunks exists: I've seen Ray
twice and he wasn't the same. I've seen Duncan twice and
he wasn't the same. Neither recognized me either. We've
all introduced ourselves to Jim Kallstrom as one another,
and did the same to several of Kallstrom's stand-ins. Mark this: "Perry Metzger" for certain is non-existent, it's only
a mail drop, a chalk mark, a can by the road, a highly paid
fictional security scam: Pay or plonk. Cooped cops and holed-up criminals do, up the kazoo.
I say for a fact the crypto/cypherpunk/cops/spooks game's one bird doing a solo dance. Who that bird is, works for, remains to be reported reliably: an impossibility by definition. 100 to 1 it's a rogue bot, buried in a bridge caisson, powered by tidal flow or planetary rotation, unstoppable until earth freezes,
burns or implodes to infinite deception.
Dimitri was not terminated, can't be, he never was, like the rest
of us highly classified phantasms. Adam Back got the story
right, he's exchanging messages with a bot mirroring his inner evil, call that Tim, call it Dimitri, he'll call back as the One True
Terminator you don't want to meet, ever, but will.

Lead story, The New York Times, July 20, 1998:
Clinton Plans to Assign Codes, as Law Requires, to Create Giant Medical Database As legislation that would protect patient privacy languishes in Congress, the Clinton Administration is quietly laying plans to assign every American a "unique health identifier," a computer code that could be used to create a national database that would track every citizen's medical history from cradle to grave.
The electronic code was mandated by a 1996 law and would be the first comprehensive national identification system since the Social Security number was introduced in 1935. Although the idea has attracted almost no public attention, it is so contentious that Federal health officials who were supposed to propose a plan for the identifier by February, have made little headway and are instead holding hearings beginning on Monday to solicit public comment. Proponents, including insurance companies and public health researchers, say the benefits would be vast. Doctors and hospitals would be able to monitor the health of patients as they switch from one insurance plan to the next. Patients would not have to wade through a cumbersome bureaucracy to obtain old records. Billing would be streamlined, saving money. A national disease database could be created, offering unlimited opportunities for scientific study. But opponents, including privacy advocates and some doctors' groups, say the code smacks of Big Brother. They warn that sensitive health information might be linked to financial data or criminal records and that already tenuous privacy protections would be further weakened as existing managed care databases, for example, are linked. They say that trust in doctors, already eroded by managed care, would deteriorate further, with patients growing reluctant to share intimate details. And in a world where computer hackers can penetrate the Pentagon's computer system, they ask, will anyone's medical records be safe?

"The Long, Strong Arm of the NSA," about the
Agency's methods of enforcing export obedience
with intimidation, delay and obfuscation:
 User manual: Dodging the rules  By Ellen Messmer Network World,  The National Security Agency (NSA) wrote the export rules on encryption. But from the point of view of corporations that want to ship U.S. software to their foreign offices, getting around the U.S. export rules is a top priority.
 And even for those who used to work at the NSA, it's still a challenge.
 "Well, I wrote those export rules when I was at the NSA," confessed Russell Davis, now chief of information technology security at SBC Warburg Dillon Read, a division of Swiss Bank Corp., which operates in 77 countries. Since joining the corporate life, Davis has used his knowledge of the NSA to find ways to work around the export system on behalf of his customer, the bank, which uses a lot of encryption-based security gear.
 "It took 17 months to figure out how to get crypto-based smart cards to Swiss facilities and elsewhere," Davis said. "But I wrote the rules on all this, and I know how to get around them." Would he ever consider using government-
approved data-recovery?
 "Never," Davis declared. "My customers come first!"
 "Our customers just aren't going to buy these types of products," said Tom Carty, vice president of business development for GTE CyberTrust. He agreed the government is leading industry down a path to build products few users will willingly buy.

2. By special request of sweettalking crackers who had heard about the first batch, we got a few more, and knowing these folks

3. Chase refilled our account and apologized for insufficient
protection from electronic bandits. The bandits sent us 50%

4. Recently, we got two of Citibank's cards with $5.00 each on them. Tried for days to get local merchants to take them, none
would because they lacked a unique magnetic stripe they'd
been advised to watch for, which, we later learned, once swiped
could tap into global data banks on the user, clean their
accounts, screw their records, erase the institutionalized mugging, leave an audit showing it was the irresponsible military-site crackers who did it.
5. We got $5,000,000 digi-cash for that info from SDA, who got it from the institutions running the Mondex banditry: those ACP recommends the Commerce Department grant license exceptions for the export of encryption products of any strength that have been determined to be "legitimate and responsible."[*]

@_subject: Jim Bell Rage 
Received from anonymous July 26, 1998:
The Columbian (Oregon), No date.
Written by John Branton, Columbian staff writer
Eleven months in prison - and counting - haven't muzzled
James Dalton Bell's rage about what he calls government
"black operations" against him. "This story has more
government misbehavior than Watergate", Bell wrote in a
recent letter to The Columbian.
He added in a phone call"I'm in a little bit of danger.
These people don't want me talking to you."
Bell is the 39-year-old McLoughlin Heights man who wrote
an Internet essay, "Assassination Politics", that
proposed the bounty-driven murder of "government
slimeballs". The former electronics engineer hadn't
spoken to The Columbian for about a year, until recently.
He was released from federal prison in April.
Bell served 11 months after pleading guilty to using
false Social Security numbers and obstructing the
Internal Revenue Service by trying to intimidate agents
and stink bombing their Vancouver office. Bell returned
to his parents' home this spring but was free only
about two months. Currently, Bell is back in a federal
prison in Seattle, awaiting a July 31 hearing on charges
that he violated his probation conditions. He's alleged
to have refused a court-ordered mental-health evaluation
and search of his parents' home.
Who is this man, many people have asked, who lives in our
midst when he isn't in prison - and if the IRS is to be
believed, dabbled with things such as nerve gas, botulism
toxin and sodium cyanide? IRS agents say Bell published a
"hit list" of agents' home addresses on the Internet for
his anti-government "patriot" friends, and discussed
contaminating water supplies with a buddy.
Is IRS Inspector Jeff Gordon correct in comparing Bell to
Timothy McVeigh and Theodore Kaczynski and saying the IRS
interrupted him in plans to commit murder? No, says Bell. "They knew I wasn't planning to kill federal agents",
Bell said this month. "They were scared because I had
written something that shows a way to eliminate
government. They were afraid I could convince the public
that I could replace existing government for no more than
a 10th or 20th of its current cost."
His wariness of the federal government is understandable
- they put him in prison. But his words reveal a view of
governmental duplicity like the fictional world of X-
Files agents Mulder and Scully. "Paranoid would be a good
word", said Bell's federal probation officer, Matthew
Richards. Bell, asked why he doesn't obey his court-
ordered probation terms to stay out of prison, made a
reference to the political imprisonment of Nelson
Mandela, South Africa's president. "I believe that when
the federal government decided to spy on me, simply
because of my political opposition to their tyranny and
terrorism, it dramatically diverged from what the average
American citizen would be inclined to tolerate", Bell
wrote recently.
Beginning in late 1995 or early 1996, Bell said, federal
agents read his "Assassination Politics" essay, posted on
the Internet. The essay described a computerized system
to ward "untraceable digital cash" to anyone who
correctly predicted the exact time of a federal agent's
murder. In Bell's words, "Imagine for a moment that, as
ordinary citizens were watching the evening news, they
see an act by a government employee or officeholder that
they feel violates their rights, abuses the public's
trust or misuses the powers that they feel should be
limited. What if they could go to their computers, type
in the miscreant's name, and select a dollar amount. If
0.1 percent of the population, or one person in a
thousand, was willing to pay $1 to see some government
slimeball dead, that would be in effect, a $250,000
bounty on his head."
Alarmed, Bell says, federal agents used two homes near
his parent's home, one on Corregidor Road and the other
on Mississippi Drive, for a clandestine and possibly
illegal surveillance operation. Agents supposedly
installed thousands of dollars worth of sophisticated
equipment, possibly using microwave technology, to spy on
Bell. "None of that occurred", said federal probation
officer Richards. "Absolutely not true", said the owner
of one of the houses. "I wouldn't let the feds in my
Bell said he suspects the agents bugged his phone
illegally - and followed him when he got out of prison
briefly in April. "We never bugged his phone", Richards
said. "No tailing whatsoever". Once, Bell said, he
spotted someone following him and turned the tables on
them. Bell followed the car to Rixen's Enterprises, 2700
N. Hayden Island Drive, which he suspects is a secret
front for a federal "black operation".
"No spooks here", said the owner, Jim Rixen, 40, who said
he deals in heating systems for boats and recreational
vehicles. "I've had this company for 13 years. You can
ask anybody on this island. You're more than welcome to
come here and go through everything I've got. He might
have followed some customer of mine here. I've never
heard anything about it."
In his upcoming hearing in the U.S. District Court in
Tacoma, the government will charge Bell with additional -
so far undisclosed - probation violations, Richards said.
If Bell has any actual evidence of illegal practices by
the government, that would be the place to bring it up.

The National Security Agency is losing ground in the fight
to keep hard-to-find cryptography experts from being lured
to greener pastures.
By Richard Lardner
Price Waterhouse didn't become a force in the consulting
world by ignoring market trends. So it was no surprise when
the firm decided to expand its information security
operation. After all, the Internet has completely changed
the way business is done: Paper is out, electrons are in.
But just as electronic commerce is skyrocketing, so too are
the odds that sensitive corporate information might be
tampered with as it travels through cyberspace. With the private sector beginning to recognize that the
digital door swings both ways, there's growing demand for
the "risk management" services Price Waterhouse and other
companies are offering to help keep the hackers at bay. To
snare these potential clients, the company needed to hire
hundreds of information technology professionals. Trouble
is, information protection may be a huge growth area, but
the talent pool is mighty shallow. So officials at Price Waterhouse did what many other
commercial enterprises have done, and continue to do. They
targeted a group of employees at the Defense Department's
secretive National Security Agency, where thousands of the
federal government's best and brightest spend their days
eavesdropping on other countries while at the same time
ensuring that U.S. information networks are secure. Because
of the highly sensitive missions the agency performs,
companies like Price Waterhouse know they are getting
employees who are extremely good at what they do and are
solid citizens too-NSA is picky about whom it hires and
conducts thorough background investigations. Full text:

Tim asks:
Threat of terrorism will be the impetus for applying national security restrictions domestically, for relaxing cold war limitations on spying
on Americans, for dissolving barriers between law enforcement
and military/intelligence agencies.
Technical means for access to encrypted data will probably
come first in communications, then to stored material. There
will be an agreement for increased CALEA wiretap funding, which is what the two cellular and wired suits against the FBI intend,
(paralleling what the hardware and software industries want from
federal buyers of security products).
This will provide the infrastructural regime for the gov to monitor and store domestic traffic as NSA does for the global, using the same technology (NSA may provide service to domestic
LEA as it now does for other gov customers for intel).
Other access will come through hardware and software for
computers, paralleling technology developed for telecomm tapping,
tracking and monitoring. Most probably through overt/covert features of microprocessors and OS's, as reported recently of Wintel and others, but also probably with special chips for DSP and software for modular design -- why build from scratch when these handy kits are As noted here, the features will appear first as optional, in response
to demand from commerce, from parents, from responsible
institutions, to meet public calls for protection, for privacy, for
combating threats to the American people. Like wiretap law, use of the features for preventative snooping will initially require a court order, as provided in several of the crypto legislative proposals.
Like the wiretap orders, gradually there will be no secret court refusals for requests to use the technology in the national interest.
A publicity campain will proclaims that citizens with nothing to hide will have nothing to fear. Assurance of safety will be transparent, no clicks on the line. In a digital world, home-office devices will send
lifestyle data to the device manufacturers over the always monitoring transparental Net.
Personal privacy will evaporate almost unnoticeably, as with the tv remote control, cp/defcon/bar brag, telephone, fax and forever-lovers

Given that moral and financial and political betrayal and treachery do not qualify for grave natsec threat, and only those acts which aim at snatching the very best technology for political control, it's the NBC toys that attract most of the serious searchers for terrorists under the global bed.
For crypto-in-a-crime that might mean sending here an encrypted

Or where the recovered Pu and triggers are stored in the TX panhandle, helpfully describing what's fake and what's not,

Or what and where BW or CW armaments are being refreshed,
repaired, deactivated, or invented in top secrecy just in case
some rogue violates a treaty, what tools are needed to sniff precursors, how to weed the spoofs, and how to avoid seeded soil in your backyard.
Or where key targeters of foreign terrorists live, their childrens' school, their favorite places to get away from the terrible

Or, could one encrypt a message to oneself claiming to

Or, create a PK pair, encrypt such a message, then post it,

PGP-authenticated and -decoded, and their style and content assessed for identity of the author, along with other allegations by the RCMP on what Carl may or may not have done up north and by the Secret Service on Carl may or may not have said out west.
We have also been told that Carl is known as "The King

We're putting together copies of cpunk messages Jeff Gordon cites in the Carl Johnson complaint and have found all in the archives except one dated June10, 1998. Jeff describes it:
   15. On June 10, 1998, an anonymous message was    posted to the Cypherpunks Internet group. In the
   message, it is stated that the bomber "placed the bomb    before embarking on a middle-leg of the TruthMonger
   SoftTarget Tour of Planet Terra." The message also    referenced an RCMP plan to "drive a known madman    crazy enough to finally put him away turned bad, and
   resulted in a backlash of death and destruction ..." I    noted that this message contained information about the
   courthouse bomb incident which had not previously been    made public, and was written in a style and manner
   which I recognized as being similar to other writings    which my investigation has linked to JOHNSON. In his
   interview with Special Agent Sheridan, JOHNSON    acknowledged using the name TruthMonger, and also
   stated he had psychological problems, both of which    correspond to this message. We'd appreciate getting a copy (yes, Jeff, if you would, anon ok).
BTW, there's a brief message from Lucky Green yesterday
in the archives on CEJ which did not appear on the

like all cpunks off the wall.

An exemplary case of acting up like the Totos and other performance
pseudo-Feynmann's here, is that of Dario Fo, the Italian artist who recently won the Nobel Prize. His off the chart genius, too, was in mixing the real and imaginary to challenge, and to frighten, authority into revealing their treacherous deception of the real and imaginary to maintain state and religious control century after century, culture
after culture. He, too, was regularly condemned by those obsesses
with holding onto power, and sometimes arrested, for his imitations
of them at their most buffoonish and serious.
Fo is from an earlier generation, though, and what more agressively
offensive form is suitable for those younger we may be witnessing in the Jim Bells, Unknown Arrestees, and those here not yet projected onto the world stage but working the crowd most effectively.
Black Unicorn, step up to the mike. Show magic.
In any, case, I'm delighted to see Cypherpunks get credit in the Johnson

A tumultous trial to amplify this forum's mayhemic virtues and vices would be magnificently chaotic and hopefully anarchic to the max. Pray for CJ to get an equally mad attorney to demand his day, and our day, in court.

Bear in mind that that information on this matter may be used to hammer or help Carl Johnson if not others.
As Adam Back has proposed: To check the validity of the allegations made by the IRS about Toto(s)'s messages in the Carl Johnson complaint, a review is underway of archived messages to see if there are any signatures by a key before the private key has been posted, especially if the post in question has been (or may be later) cited by the IRS.  If there are none, then the IRS "authentication" of the claimed Toto posts evaporates.  Even if there are some, the `authentication' becomes more suspect if there are others which are made after the key post.
To assist checking messages an initial list of candidate keys is available (none of the anonymous keys show a link to Carl Johnson
of the IRS complaint):

Below is a 1994 thumbnail description of the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, taken from a long, critical report on prisoner health care with more on the Springfield
facility available at:
    (81K)
Bureau of Prisons Health Care: Inmates' Access to Health Care Is Limited
by Lack of Clinical Staff (Letter Report, 02/10/94, GAO/HEHS-94-36).
SPRINGFIELD MEDICAL REFERRAL CENTER
   MISSION OF REFERRAL CENTER
The U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield,
Missouri, is one of the Bureau of Prisons' six referral centers that
treat male medical, surgical, and mental health patients.
   LOCATION AND CONDITION OF FACILITY
The Springfield Medical Referral Center is an administrative
facility, meaning it is equipped to house inmates of all security
levels.  It was built about 1933.  Inmates live in six connected
buildings, each of two or three stories.  The medical facilities are
concentrated in four of the six buildings.  The acute and chronic
care medical and surgical patients are housed in units that resemble
typical hospital rooms, except that several rooms in each unit have
locked doors.  These locked cells are used for patients who are (1)
dangerous to staff or other inmates, (2) participating in the federal
witness protection program, or (3) waiting for their custody status
to be determined.  The mental health patients are housed in units
that resemble typical prison cell blocks with one-man cells.
Springfield also has a unit that can contain up to 37 inmates in
individual locked cells for disciplinary or protective reasons.
   NUMBER OF INMATES AND PATIENTS SERVED
Springfield serves approximately 1,120 inmates, including 439
patients who require medical or surgical care and 294 who need
psychiatric care.  The medical and surgical care is provided to about
46 acute care patients, 54 patients receiving renal dialysis, and 393
other chronic or recovering patients.  The mental health population
includes 177 treatment patients and 117 forensic inmates who are
being evaluated for their mental ability to stand trial.
   NUMBER AND TYPE OF MEDICAL BEDS
The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
rates Springfield as a 46-bed acute care and 177-bed mental health
   NUMBER AND TYPE OF STAFF POSITIONS AUTHORIZED    AND FILLED
In July 1993, Springfield had 279 authorized health care positions,
including 5 psychiatrists, 15 medical/surgical physicians, an
optometrist, 12 physician assistants, 127 nurses, 9 pharmacists, 12
psychologists, 6 quality assurance staff, 10 medical records staff,
and 82 other health care staff.  At that time, 18 positions were
vacant, including 3 medical physicians, a surgeon, a psychiatrist, a
physician assistant, 10 nurses, 1 medical records staff, and 1 other
health care staff.  The following specialists were working at
Springfield:  3 general practitioners, 4 psychiatrists, 2 internists, 2 neurologists, 1 physiatrist, 1 anesthesiologist, 1 orthopedic surgeon, and 1 chief of health programs.
Physicians and physician assistants are available 24 hours a day.
However, physicians generally work from 7:30 a.m.  to 4:00 p.m.
During the evening and night shifts and on weekends, one physician,
one psychiatrist, and one psychologist are on call.  Physician
assistants are available in the facility 16 hours a day.  Nurses are
responsible for medical care between 10:00 p.m.  and 6:00 a.m.
Nursing service is provided 24 hours a day.
   STAFF ORGANIZATION
The Associate Warden for Medical Services supervises most of
Springfield's health care staff, including nurses and technicians.
The Clinical Director is responsible for the internal medicine
physicians, psychiatrists, surgeons, dentists, physician assistants,
the quality assurance coordinator, utilization manager, and
infection-control practitioners.  The Associate Warden for Mental
Health Services is responsible for the psychologists and social
workers who work with the mental health patients.

Is there a PKZip-encryption cracker online for the following program which claims to offer a link to a couple of dozen shareware password crackers of
popular programs?  The exe-file is easily downloaded. There's a copy for testing for privacy protection:
    (20K)
Investigating the Suspect Computer
PC Data Recovery for the Criminal Investigator
Law Enforcement Use Only
   http//
WHAT EXACTLY, DOES THE SOFTWARE DO ? The software is designed to almost completely automate
the formidable task of extracting forensic data from
today's modern personal computers with large or multiple
hard drives. The program automatically examines startup
files for "booby traps", and searches the entire machine
for "bomb" programs which, if triggered, could destroy
valuable evidence on the machine. PC-Investigator runs
exclusively from diskette, at the DOS level, and does
NOT perform any write operations to the hard drive. This
insures that fragile data, or files that may be evidence
which have been deleted, or are resident in "slack
space", are not inadvertently overwritten. A unique feature of the software is the ability to construct
custom-tailored reports. The catalog function extracts
and organizes all the files on the hard drive, and sorts
them into order by type, date and time, according to
directory. During this process, all the readable (text) files
are extracted into a separate list, and are organized by
type in the report. Also available is an extracted report
listing of graphic (picture) files, and files that are typically used on the Internet, along with an extracted list of word processor files, backup files, ASCII text, and files that are recovered by CHKDSK or SCANDISK, which are
commonly overlooked as a source of forensic evidence. PC-Investigator has unique features that duplicate the
manual functions normally performed during such
forensic investigations. The most valuable feature is the
ability to search all the files on the disk for the presence
of up to 600 words or phrases called HotWords, that you
supply in an editable file. This function is the equivalent
of the manual process of "Find Files and Folders" / "Files
Containing" under Windows 95 , which typically takes
30 seconds to 3 minutes to do manually for each word or
phrase you are looking for. The function is performed
using words and phrases from the HotWord list,
hundreds of times per second.
A typical 2 Gigabyte hard drive may contain over 500
readable text files. A manual search for the occurrence of
a single word or phrase occurring in those files typically
takes 90 seconds. If you had to search for those 200
words manually, the time required would be  5 hours at
the keyboard. The HotWord search feature of PC-
Investigator performs this function on a 486/50 machine
in just under 45 minutes. If the number of files to be
searched is substantially higher, such as on today's large
hard drives (typically 2 to 4 Gigabytes, with 12 Gigabyte
drives available on top-end systems) the time required to
perform an exhaustive search would be proportionately
higher (500 to 1,000 man-hours). PC-Investigator
completely searches a 2 Gigabyte drive n a 486/120
machine in just under 24 hours. The faster the processor,
and hard disk controller, the faster the program will run to
completion. The best part is that each file containing any of the words
or phrases in your list is cataloged in the report, along
with the number of "hits" or HotWords found in the file.
After the program is started, and the desired options are
selected, the program will run un-attended, doing the
work that would normally not be done in such cases
because of the tremendous amount of time and effort
involved. Of course, files which do not contain "clear
text", or are DES or BLOWFISH / PGP encrypted will not
be flagged by the program. However, we have software
which addresses the problem of APPLICATION
encryption - that is - files which are encrypted by the
application which created them. For example, LOTUS
123, Quick Books, PFS Professional, and WordPerfect
are among the few programs which offer in-application
encryption of files. The program does NOT extract or examine the data from
"slack space". However, running the program is easy,
and can be done by almost anyone with a bit of computer
skills. The software is designed as a preliminary
investigative tool, to determine if a machine should be
examined by a professional. If this program indicates a
"HOT" machine, you can be certain that a more
extensive investigation is warranted.              -----

We attended Defense Secretary Cohen's talk today at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City on "Security in a Grave World."
While not included in the prepared text, Secretary Cohen remarked in the Q&A on terrorism and encryption policy that Americans will have to decide how much privacy they will be willing to give up for protection against terrorism, and cited the FBI's similar views on the threat of encryption use by terrorists. Afterwards I had an informative chat with Kenneth Bacon, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, to ask about interviewing Secretary Cohen on Echelon, the global electronic intercept and surveillance system operated by the National Security Agency. Mr. Bacon said the Department will not comment on such matters. I acknowledged that was the case heretofore, but with intense European interest in Echelon, I asked if would it be possible for Secretary Cohen to give a statement on the topic.
I noted that Secretary Cohen in his talk today had listed international cooperation as a principal need of US defense policy, and that Echelon had raised considerable suspicion of US interception and surveillance prowess which could inhibit international trust and cooperation. I also asked Mr. Bacon if Secretary Cohen could discuss as well the possibility of further declassification of secret technology, as with the Skipjack encryption algorithm, to enhance US economic security and for protection against information espionage. Mr. Bacon said that others in the Department would be more appropriate to discuss such topics in detail then Secretary Cohen. I asked if anyone except the Secretary had authority to discuss Echelon and declassification of secret technology. Mr. Bacon would not answer that but suggested I send a letter proposing such topics for discussion and the Department will respond.

News of easing US crypto limits sounds like the pr-fluff
put out in the summer for easing controls only for financial
institutions -- BXA is scheduled to release the rule
for that about now (originally set to be "near Labor Day"). If the news is about this rule, it may allow a few more "reputable institutions" to get the privilege traditionally extended to banks, so long as longstanding cooperation with
government is assured.
There's a report out of France on the government's issue of
a paper on crypto policy that reaffirms GAK for electronic
commerce with zero protection of privacy:
   There will probably be more such papers issued as international
cooperation to control encryption is codified in accordance
with the Wassenaar Arrangement and whatever secret
agreements Aron and others have concluded. The US version will probably come out gradually as global agreements are firmed up, Congress is briefed, and US agencies are satisfied that export holes in other countries have been closed.
Then watch for domestic clampdown on encryption, as Cohen and others have warned must be done to protect the populace from
too much freedom.
The secret deals among governments to share technology for information
security and electronic surveillance in return for global controls must be wonderful reads of duplicity and disinformation, among the participants
in the classified parts, and among the populace in the public versions.
On a related topic, weakness of DES, the ANSI X9 committee handling
cryptography has circulated a draft paper on what banks should do in response to recent successful cracks of DES:

THE WHITE HOUSE
                       Office of the Press Secretary
For Immediate Release
September 16, 1998
                     STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY
                 Administration Updates Encryption Policy
     The Clinton Administration today announced a series of steps to update
its encryption policy in a way that meets the full range of national
interests:  promotes electronic commerce, supports law enforcement and
national security and protects privacy.  These steps are a result of
several months of intensive dialogue between the government and U.S.
industry, the law enforcement community and privacy groups that was called
for by the Vice President and supported by members of Congress.
     As the Vice President stated in a letter to Senator Daschle, the
Administration remains committed to assuring that the nation?s law
enforcement community will be able to access, under strictly defined legal
procedures, the plain text of criminally related communications and stored
information.   The Administration intends to support FBI?s establishment of
a technical support center to help build the technical capacity of law
enforcement - Federal, State, and local - to stay abreast of advancing
communications technology.
     The Administration will also strengthen its support for electronic
commerce by permitting the export of strong encryption when used to protect
sensitive financial, health, medical, and business proprietary information
in electronic form.  The updated export policy will allow U.S. companies
new opportunities to sell encryption products to almost 70 percent of the
world?s economy, including the European Union, the Caribbean and some Asian
and South American countries.  These changes in export policy were based on
input from industry groups while being protective of national security and
law enforcement interests.
     The new export guidelines will permit exports to other industries
beyond financial institutions, and further streamline exports of key
recovery products and other recoverable encryption products.  Exports to
those end users and destination countries not addressed by today?s
announcement will continue to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
     Very strong encryption with any key length (with or without key
recovery) will now be permitted for export, under license exception, to
several industry sectors.   For example, U.S. companies will be able to
export very strong encryption for use between their headquarters and their
foreign subsidiaries worldwide except the seven terrorist countries (Iran,
Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North Korea and Cuba) to protect their sensitive
company proprietary information.
     On-line merchants in 45 countries will be able to use robust U.S.
encryption products to protect their on-line electronic commerce
transactions with their customers over the Internet.
     Insurance companies as well as the health and medical sectors in those
same 46 countries will be able to purchase and use robust U.S. encryption
products to secure health and insurance data among legitimate users such as
hospitals, health care professionals, patients, insurers and their
     The new guidelines also allow encryption hardware and software
products with encryption strength up to 56-bit DES or equivalent to be
exported without a license, after a one time technical review, to all users
outside the seven terrorist countries.    Currently, streamlined exports of
DES products are permitted for those companies that have filed key recovery
business plans.  However, with the new guidelines, key recovery business
plans will no longer be required.
     The Administration will continue to promote the development of key
recovery products by easing regulatory requirements.   For the more than 60
companies which have submitted plans to develop and market key recovery
encryption products, the six month progress reviews will no longer be
required.  Once the products are ready for market, they can be exported,
with any bit length -- without a license -- world-wide (except to terrorist
nations) after a one-time review.   Furthermore, exporters will no longer
need to name or submit additional information on a key recovery agent prior
to export.  These requirements will be removed from the regulations.
     Finally, industry has identified other so-called "recoverable"
products and techniques that allow for the recovery of plaintext by a
system or network administrator and that can also assist law enforcement
access, subject to strict procedures.   The Administration will permit
their export for use within most foreign commercial firms, and their
wholly-owned subsidiaries, in large markets, including Western Europe,
Japan and Australia, to protect their internal business proprietary
     The Administration welcomes a continued dialogue with U.S. industry
and intends to review its policy in one year to determine if additional
updates may be necessary to continue a balanced approach that protects the
public safety and national security, ensures privacy, enables continued
technology leadership by U.S. industry and promotes electronic commerce.

                 Administration Updates Encryption Policy
    Exports of 56-bit DES and equivalent products (hardware and software)
     will be streamlined (under license exception).  Requirements for key
     recovery plans are eliminated.
    Exports of unlimited strength encryption products (with or without key
     recovery) will be streamlined (under license exception) to certain
     industries.  The sectors are:
    Subsidiaries of U.S. Firms, worldwide (except seven terrorist nations).
    Insurance companies to the same 45 countries recently approved for
     exports to banks and financial institution exports.
    Health and medical organizations (including civilian government health
     agencies) in the same 45 countries.  Does not include
     biochemical/pharmaceutical manufacturers.
    On-line merchants for client-server applications, in the same 45
   countries, with the purpose of securing electronic transactions between
   merchants and their customers.  Does not include manufacturers and
   distributors of items controlled on the U.S. munitions list.
    Key Recovery products will continue to be exportable under license
     exception worldwide (except seven terrorist nations).  Review of
     foreign key recovery agents is eliminated.
    Exports of "recoverable" products will be approved to most commercial
     firms, and their wholly-owned subsidiaries, in a broad range of
     countries under encryption licensing arrangements.  This group of
     countries covers most major commercial markets including Western
     Europe, Japan, and Australia.  The policy does not include service
     providers and manufacturers and distributors of items controlled on
     the U.S. munitions list.
    Exports to end users or destinations outside this policy are possible
     on a case-by-case basis.
    Prior to export, products are subject to a one-time product technical
     review.

Excerpt from DoD transcription of Secretary of Defense Cohen's
remarks at the Council on Foreign Relations, New York City, September 14, 1998:
Let me say one other thing about terrorism.  We in this country much recognize the tension which will exist as you ask us, and we will ask all successor administrations, to protect us.  And you say, how do you protect someone against terrorists?  It means increased intelligence.  It means increased intelligence, having greater capability on the ground or from national technical sources to find out who is planning and plotting what at what place and what time.  To do that is going to put us in somewhat of a direct conflict with rights to privacy, something that we hold very dear in this country.  So the more intelligence-gathering responsibilities that any administration is going to have, there's going to come a point of tension and, indeed, friction between how much are you willing to give up in order to be secure.  Those are the kind of unpleasant choices that are going to be manifesting themselves in the near future.  We haven't really faced up to it yet.  We're starting to see some of that conflict at least intellectually develop when you see the manufacturers of software who don't like the fact that the law enforcement, the FBI, the Justice Department wants to have some method of getting into encrypted technology. You say, "Wait a minute, that's my right of privacy.  I'm a businessman or woman.  I want to be able to send information out over those -- those airwaves and have them completely protected."  Our Justice Department says, "Wait a minute, you want us to protect you.  But you're allowing criminal elements, terrorists and others
 -- organized crime, drug cartels -- to encrypt their telecommunications to the point where don't know what's going on.  And then something is going to happen, and you'll say, where were you?"
So those are the kinds of tensions that are going to continue to exist.  But we're going to have to have more intelligence to effectively deal with terrorism in the future.  [End excerpt]

Forwarded message:
I spoke with Jim last night. He had been "in the hole", as he calls it, for almost 7 days. This is when he is placed in a cell by himself on a different floor and is not
allowed out of it (they bring his food to him, instead of his going to the cafeteria, and can't go out to the social area - to play pool, for instance). He said it was because he had remarked to a warden that she had the ugliest voice in the whole world, after she repeatedly told the inmates to clean up their rooms even though they had complied
repeatedly to her demands. (I asked him if he had spent the time reading Atlas Shrugged, and he said he'd done that a bit. I don't think he's much interested in railroads, taking quite some time to get through it, although he told me he's a fast reader).
Anyway last night his things had been packed and he expected to be shipped to Oklahoma City this morning.  He will be there anywhere from half a day to two days and then be sent
on to Springfield, MO for the mental eval. Perhaps he will meet up with Toto there.
[End forward]
If it's not been mentioned here CJ was in transit to Springfield over the weekend, being held for unknown
reasons in OKC from where he called a fan who passed
on the news. He's in good spirits.
And Jim is reported to be in good spirits. So it's all
worked out, their notoriety a tonic for tired blood, try
it, depressives.
Both are sassing the jailers, getting railroaded to OKC and Springfield for a bit of mind-bending and -straightening. Are they fit to stand trial, oh yeah, do it, the snakes of Medusa.
No one knows what the OKC stopover for Jim or CJ is about,
maybe to introduce them to each other (Jim claims to not know CJ -- smart), maybe to kick dirt on the homeplate of
Murrah Memorial, get image-counseled by Anita Hill.
Jim and CJ in Springfield at the same time, getting heavy
mentaled, wordsmith assassination duelers. Now that's a Teen Spirit I'd like to smell.

CHP introduces cellular-friendly 911 system
Operators will now be able to capture the
telephone number and location of the caller
within a half-block area
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 17 - The California Highway Patrol
this week demonstrated a new countywide 911 system designed
to provide operators with the telephone numbers and
location of callers using mobile telephones.
Los Angeles County is the first in the state to use
the new technology, said CHP Sgt. Ernie Sanchez.
All local 911 calls for the CHP, whether via mobile
phones or "land lines," are routed to the CHP
half-a-millionCommunications Center just west of downtown, but mobile phone calls could not be traced until recently, Sanchez said.
"It doesn't matter if you live in Pasadena or Arcadia
or West Covina; if you call on a cell phone, that call will
go through the CHP Communications Center" and operators
will be able to capture the telephone number and location
of the caller within a half-block area, Sanchez said.
The enhanced technology has been in use for the past
three weeks, he said.
All major mobile phone companies are participating in
the test and demonstration of the system, Sanchez said,
adding that the technology should be in place nationwide by
2001 under Federal Communications Commission rules.

DoD rolled out today the new Defense Threat Reduction
Agency which combines several agencies -- Defense
Special Weapons Agency, Defense Technology Security Administration, On-Site Inspection Agency and others --
into a new organization whose principle purpose will be
to control the spread of technologies of mass destruction.
See remarks made at the opening ceremony by Hamre and others:
   And the new, informative DTRA Web site:
   The briefing remarks are of interest for what they disclose
about military planning for combating domestic terrorism (parallel to what the FBI said about it yesterday), promises to speed export licensing and a passing reference by Hamre to "a recent ten month process of encryption policy review."
Which may refer to the recent administration policy announcement or maybe another in the works.
With the build-up of domestic terrorism fighting forces --
all the mil and gov agencies -- and noises about legislation
being developed for more, it's worth pondering what is
coming with a crackdown on domestic use of encryption.
The Canadian duplicitous announcement today may offer
a clue to what's being secretly agreed upon internationallly: state there will be no domestic controls (to assure privacy

with a statement about new legislation to criminalize
encryption use in the name of "public safety" and provision
for access to encrypted data (to assure national security and law enforcement).

A distinguishing feature of the complaints and indictments
of suspects in the African Embassy bombings is the
use of the phrase "in the special maritime and territorial
jurisdiction of the United States, as that term is defined in
Title 18, United States Code, Section 7(3), and outside the jurisdiction of any particular state or jurisdiction," to apparently lay claim to the legal right of the US to arrest and imprison terrorist suspects for acts in any location where US law customarily would not be valid:
   Would any of our legal advisors know the origin of that phrase "outside the jurisdiction of any particular state or jurisdiction?" Is this new, and devised to reduce conflict

prevent them from being terrorist targets for cooperating

Note: Alan is referring to the closed-door added provisions available at:
   House Passes Roving Wiretaps, Expands Federal Surveillance Powers
In a closed-door manuever, controversial "roving wiretap" provisions were
added to a major Intelligence authorization bill and passed by the House
this afternoon. Current wiretapping law allows tapping of a particular
person's phones. The new provisions would dramatically expand current
authority by allowing taps on any phone used by, or "proximate" to, the
person being tapped -- no matter whose phone it is. Such a broad law
invites abuse.
In the last Congress, the full House of Representatives rejected these
provisions after an open and vigorous debate. This week, behind closed
doors, a conference committee added the provisions to the important
Intelligence Authorization Conference Report, almost certain to pass the
Congress. The provisions were not in either the original House or Senate
versions of the bill.  CDT is particularly concerned that such an expansion
of federal authority should take place without a public debate.
The text of the new roving wiretap provisions will be available this
evening on CDT's Web site at: Alan Davidson, Staff Counsel                 202.637.9800 (v)

I said yes it did and it'd be a help to know which messages are believable, that it's a bitch these days trying to figure out who's who and who's writing what. I said the msg'd be in  the archives shortly if he wanted to check it out, and offered  to forward a copy in the meantime. He said sure I'll take a look at it and let you know.

Other inquiries of folks on the list will probably happen,

It's likely that more serious targets will be approached later,
using material obtained from those not at risk, those with

At least that's what happened with Jim Bell and CJ. They, too,
said they were handled in a friendly courteous manner until ... the case was presented to a magistrate.
According to CJ's sister even the shrink at Springfield is
the friendliest most courteous person she's talked to, helpful, considerate, and said he had CJ's interest at heart. She said she just hoped he didn't cut off CJ's medicine, cause him to go berzerk, then to disappear.
It's that switch from friendly and couterous to the other that
none of want to think about, eh? "You're under arrest. Anything
you say can and will be used against you." Hmm, what was I
saying, posting, here.
BTW, the offshore archives, if they are offshore, are a problem
for getting legal access to, and to use in court. I think a human linkage is preferred, in deposition, in court, testifying for the record.
Makes a more convincing case to have a live body telling the
facts of the matter, explaining how things work, somewhat eager to instruct and please, in self-preservation, to keep the cops and
court friendly and courteous. What was told to the investigators in private, that's what hung Jim Bell and CJ.
But, hey, they were nuts, right? Fuck them. Then the friendly folks came for you and me, working a list.

We offer the FBI's 23-page affidavit of charges against David
Sheldon Boone, ex-NSA cryptanalyst who allegedly
passed top secret SIGINT, EW and nuclear targeting plans to the Soviets:
   Tantalizing hints on means and methods, quoting the affidavit of the FBI agent in charge:
  On one occasion, "Igor" [Soviet agent] told BOONE that the   KGB/SVRR had access to United States Signals Directive   (USSID) Zero, which was an index of all other USSIDs, and   from this index IGOR asked BOONE to obtain specific USSIDs.   I have ascertained that USSIDs are classified NSA publications   for use in providing Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) support to   the United States military.
  BOONE told the OA [FBI Operational Asset posing as Soviet   agent to set up Boone] that he had given "Igor" a photocopy   of an NSA document entitled "United States Signals Intelligence   Directive (USSID) 514," dated May 6, 1988.  BOONE told the   OA that this USSID was unusual because it was one of few   USSIDs to be classified TOP SECRET rather than SECRET.   BOONE told the OA that USSID 514 was not widely   disseminated but that one copy had been at USAFS   Augsburg. And more on Boone's training and duties in cryptanalysis at
Fort Meade and in Germany.

The other humor is that upon indictment for criminal charges

The arrest warrant was "returned unexecuted" on October 9,
due to "warrant issued in error" by the same magistrate who

Not that one should advocate hiding what might be construed

@_subject: CJustice 
We got documents on CJ from the US District Court,Western WA, in Tacoma. Pretty skimpy but informative on why CJ has been held for two months since his arrest on August 18.
As noted earlier, CJ has been indicted, clubbed with a blunt                           COUNT 1
  Beginning on or about June 23, 1997, and continuing through
  December 9, 1997, at Tacoma and elsewhere, within the Western
  District of Washington, CARL EDWARD JOHNSON, did threaten
  to kill certain federal law enforcement officers and judges
  of the United States, with intent to impeded, intimidate, or
  interfere with said officers and judges on account of their
  official duties.
  All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections
  115(a)(1)(B).
  Dated September 30 1998.
The June 23 and December dates bracket the messages cited in
the complaint by Jeff Gordon, and discussed here. The grand
jury must have base its charge on Jeff's complaint for there's
no explication of the charges in the indictment. (See the complaint
at: On the date of the indictment a bench warrant was issued for CJ's arrest. It was returned on October 9 marked "returned unexcuted - warrant issued in error - per AUSA Robb London." CJ was in Springfield during this time.
There were two handwritten notes. One says: "Called Tucson - Have Mag case on 98-2824M. Undergoing psych eval. 8/26/98. 520-620-7200.
The other: "10/5/98. Per Tucson, Deft in Psych Eval. Unsure of
dates in order to figure Speedy Trail."
A Case Status form, dated September 22, 1998, notes that CJ is
in detention based on a District of Arizona order, with the
note, "8-18-98; now awaiting compentency evaluation and R40
hearing." At the bottom the form states "The estimated trial time is 4 trial days."
What's screwy about all this is that when the grand jury returned the indictment and a bench warrant was issued, CJ was in Springfield but the AUSA seemed not to know it, or didn't tell the magistrate who issued the bench warrant, although the notes in the case file clearly showed that this information had been recorded. Who knows what else the grand jury and judge was
told or not told by the US Attorneys and the IRS -- the public record tells naught.
And CJ's right to a speedy trial, though noted, is overridden by the prolonged psychological evaluation process, as well as
overlooked or ignored communications between WA and AZ.
And the buffoonish bench warrant? That appears to indicate incompetence in the US Attorney's office -- that's AUSA
Robb London in charge (not to slight Katrina Pflaumer, USA, and William Redkey, AUSA, who also signed the indictment).
And the four days for a trial for alleged murder attempts? Is this real? Or is this threat of quick vicious justice by biased attorneys with vengence in mind, coupled with the prolonged delay, a ploy to coerce CJ to plead?
Brings back memories of Jim Bell's punishment by delay, isolation, manipulation, change of jails, and coercion, with a plea bargain just to get the the psychological torture to Wonder if Jim and CJ are allowed to swap tips and tricks on surviving political imprisonment in the United States of America. Creative writing of text and music, lyrics for the

  Preliminary advice from an attorney is that it is likely the
  Electronic Communications Privacy Act covers this request for stored
  electronic communications, therefore requiring a real warrant (not a
  subpoena), reimbursement for the expenses of complying, etc.
  Others (if any) who have received similar subpoenas should
  consult with their attorneys, and are encouraged to publish
  (to the list and the JYA.COM web site) anything they receive
  from the government.  Having more information is usually
  a good thing; currently the prosecutor knows what he's doing,

Toad has encouraged publication of any other subpoenas in the Toto-assassination case, and we've asked for info on any other solicitations by the MIBs to list subscribers, or others, such as that to Alan Greenspan posted here.
It's understandable that anyone served or solicited might want to keep that private, upon legal advice, or for self-protection.
However, it'd be a help to those of us awaiting the slug, or wanting
to aid and abet the MIB-fed fictional conspiracy, to know what is happening. For example, the dates of contact, when the documents were served and the means used, what was asked for, or anything that might be shared without necessarily identifying who was contacted. Anon to the list or to jya if preferred.
For example, Alcatraz's subpoena was dated October 9, for a
GJ session on November 10. We don't know when the subpoena was served or how. And how those dates and compare to those of Huntsville's, though in latter case we've been told the subpoena came with two MIBs.
JYA'd like to be in Tacoma when the WWA GJ is MIB imaginary
totostimony, either in response to character-assassinatory subpoena or by idly hanging out with attention-seeking gov assassination-groupies,  so some times and dates would be helpful if different from November 10.
Bee in the bonnet: A few days before CJ's arrest warrant was issued the DoJ put out a study on the "Shared Traits of Potential Assassins:"
   The traits:
    * To achieve notoriety or fame.
    * To bring attention to a personal or public problem.
    * To avenge a perceived wrong; to retaliate for a perceived injury.
    * To end personal pain; to be removed from society; to be killed.
    * To save the country or the world; to fix a world problem.
    * To develop a special relationship with the target.
    * To make money.
    * To bring about political change.
What? The ambitious MIB job description mirrors the Cypherpunk agenda?
The PR on the report goes on:
      The report outlines how law enforcement agencies can establish programs
  and systems to identify and prevent persons with the means and interest to
  attack a protected person.  The guide may also assist law enforcement and
  security agencies responsible for investigating and preventing other
kinds of
  targeted violence, such as stalking, domestic violence or workplace
  The report takes law enforcement agencies through the entire threat
  process, from designing a protective intelligence program to investigating
  suspicious persons to closing a case.
      Protective intelligence programs are based on the idea that the risk of
  violence is minimized if persons with the interest, capacity and willingness
  to mount an attack can be identified and rendered harmless before they
  approach a protected person.

  Investigations" (NCJ 170612, 59 pp.), contact the National Criminal Justice
  Reference Service at 800-851-3420.
Amazing coincidence, this matching of Justice with the Cypherpunk
missions. MIB aiding and abetting MIB.

Maybe the Feds have more on CJ than what's in Jeff
Gordon's complaint and it was provided to the Grand
Jury for the indictment, but maybe not. The alleged threat to murder federal officials surely ricochets noisily in governmental brainpans.
It's probable that law enforcement and judicial circles have a secret treasure of confidential warnings, alerts and operations about gland-thrilling potential threats -- of which the DoJ study cited here is only one peek into Pandora's twat,
wet just so to enthrall the high benchers and avid affidavites.
Domestic terrorism looms large in boosting security budgets and for rouging the mundane, boring justice system grinding ever so drearily, getting so little appreciation what with the luridities of the Billy-Kenny crotch graball, and the newsy African
bombings and cruise attacks -- what's a Public Servant got to
do to get what's due for self-sacrifice. Why finger an assassin, thank you god for Jim and CJ, for bottomless cypherpunks
conspiracy afermenting.
For example, I spoke to the Estevan police about CJ's arrest
warrant and was told that it was for a non-extraditable offense.
So there's not much pressure coming from Canada despite
Jeff's citing that background in his complaint. I asked for docs
to flesh out Jeff's complaint but couldn't get any.
Then we know that the Secret Service interviewed CJ but took
no action on his alleged threats against DC pols (and maybe against others -- there's another aspect of CJ threats that a cpunk might want to amplify).
And there's no evidence so far of FBI involvement in CJ's case,
which as noted here is somewhat hard to understand where
there's a threat of murdering federal officials. Why the IRS is the
principal investigative office for what is no longer merely an IRS matter is not yet answerable based on what's public.
It could be that a broader investigation is underway and Jeff's
is a cover. Let us pray for that, that thanks to Jim Bell and CJ we'll all be hyperlinked to International Terrorism, the surefire stage
for rep building, raking dollars, the spunk of cpunk.
Wasn't that the characteristics of the American Dream in the DoJ list of assassin traits? Particularly, the lust to be cop-killed, or to forfeit property fast, whichever.

We've received word of a third Grand Jury subpoena in CJ's case. With a request to not publicize the person and information sought. Yep, we tried to prize it loose, citing
Gilmore's model, but no go.
Word from that person is that the trial is expected to begin in mid-November, which could indicate that CJ's evaluation will be completed shortly.
Interest in attending is picking up. We've had requests to
keep several folks informed on dates of court activity.
All we got so far is the Nov 10 date on John Gilmore's Grand
Jury subpoena and the mid-Nov trial start. So any info is most BTW, has anyone seen news reports on CJ's case other than

[Misspelled subject corrected - my initial fault, SSM.]
Tim points out the risks of Grand Jury appearance and need
for legal counsel outside the hearing.
We'll add that it's fairly common to use Grand Jury testimony
to ensnare a target - and not only Bill - who thinks there's not
much to worry about based on the friendly strokes beforehand
by velvet-gloved agents. It's the false testimony, perjury, that sinks the hook. Especially when hit with unexpected questions about matters for which
no preparation has been made, those usually completely unlike what the friendly agents suggested was the main reason for politely asking for cooperation (not telling what they already
knew the target knows and will try to hide). Presumably an attorney would prepare for this, but not all, especially if time is limited and the target does not think there's any need to fully brief counsel (even dare to fancy lawyers
aint so smart).
A prime suspect in the African Embassy bombings, US citizen Wadi el Hage, was induced to come up to NYC from Texas in this fashion, testified before the GJ and was immediately arrested for giving false testimony to questions ranging over several years of his experiences and prior statements to the FBI. The Q&A can
be seen at:
   Note that while all the bombers are charged with murder, el Hage
is multiply-charged with perjury.
Note also that all the suspects used a variety of aliases, so the
Feds allege, just like CJ is mani-nymed in Gilmore's subpoena.
Also, in this case at least two of the four suspects have recently
been isolated from outside contact, on the pretext that they may
communicate orders to "terrorists," but, more probably because they
are cooperating with prosecutors who do not want the lovely
relationship to be interrupted by outsiders. Or the Feds want to
send a signal that that is the case to spook those being sought,
and the two not cooperating.
As Jim Choate noted, the implied threat of hellish treatment if
you don't cooperate produces heebie-jeebies and overhwhelming
desire to get your life back to normal everyday, familiar panic. And if you're in jail nursed by MIB and strangers in stripes, such a threat erodes what's left of your iron discipline to never, ever squeal on comrades.
NY Times front-paged yesterday the controversy over prosecutors
offering leniency for testifying against cohorts. During the summer
an appeals panel declared such practice be bribery prohibited under a 50-year-old law and ruled that it is illegal. Within hours a higher court overruled the panel, and the issue is expected to go to the Supremes.
Even so, the panel made some indelible remarks about prosecutors
not being above the law:
  In their densely worded opinion, the panel examined precedents
  as far back as the Magna Carta, which imposed limits on the
  exercise of sovereign power. The law prohibiting "whoever" from
  offering a witness anything of value in exchange for testimony
  should apply, the judges said, to prosecutors as well as to
  everyone else.
  "Decency, security and liberty alike," the panel said, "demand that
  Government officials shall be subject to the same rules of conduct
  that are commands to the citizen."
As expected, prosecutors were furious at the panel's decision, as
were many judges, claiming that the practice was hundreds of years
old and convictions could not be obtained without it. One judge said
the decision was "amazingly unsound, not to mention nonsensical."
The Times notes that the Miranda decision got the same reception,
and was fought fiercely by the status quo investors in the justice It's a good article for preparing to meet the good and bad MIB trolling
for all too trusting, easily spooked rubes, a/k/a terrorists, a/k/a assassins.

It's quite surprising in that the recommended policy
is to not arrest potential assassins but to attempt to
persuade them to give up their plans to attack, to establish trust in the LEAs who are encouraged to listen to grievances, and helpfully arrange for treatment of whatever underlies the menace.
It seems that most who threaten assassination do
not go through with it, but do enjoy the attention it
gets, so the report reassuringly states. Hmm.
True, there are some indicators of imminent threat
that warrant more severe measures -- such as the
subject's acquistion of weapons, participation in militant organizations and persistent stalking of
And, yes, a few performance artists want to be killed on TV.
It says that most of the tiny number (83 in 50 years) of actual "assassins, attackers and near-lethal approachers" (compared to the far larger number who only talk about it) are deliberate in their planning and highly
rational about why the deed is necessary -- even
those who are mentally unstable are totally sane
in preparing for and executing attacks.
All in all, the report says assassination is not a big deal
for it doesn't happen all that much, and the task at hand is to prevent rash acts by friendly persuasion and TLC.
And brace for the assassins who never give a clue of
what's coming.
So what is going on with CJ and Jim Bell? Scare sense into them, followed by caregiving, or serious jail time?
Recall that the Secret Service (which co-authored the report)
had a friendly talk with CJ about assassination threats not long before he was arrested by Jeff Gordon. Which fits the report's

Two men convicted in biological weapons case
October 30, 1998
Web posted at: 3:10 a.m. EST (0810 GMT) BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Two men accused of scheming to attack President Clinton and others with cigarette lighters equipped with poison-coated cactus needles were convicted of sending threatening e-mail. Johnie Wise, 72, and Jack Abbott Grebe, 43, were convicted Thursday of two counts of sending threatening e-mails -- one message to the Internal Revenue Service and one to the Drug Enforcement Agency. Grebe and Wise were acquitted on one count each of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction count and five counts each of sending threatening messages -- to President Clinton, U.S. Customs, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, and the Secret Service. They could get life in prison at their Jan. 29 sentencing. Prosecutors said Wise schemed to modify a cigarette lighter so it would shoot cactus needles coated with toxins such as rabies, botulism, anthrax or HIV. Defense attorneys called idea 'silly'
Among the men's alleged targets: Clinton, the U.S. and Texas attorneys general, and FBI Director Louis Freeh. Defense attorneys called the idea "silly" and "cockamamie." There was never any evidence that the accused possessed biological weapons or tried to develop a deadly lighter. The e-mailed threats were vaguely worded and did not discuss the lighter or cactus thorns. Under federal law, however, the threats were enough for a conviction and no biological weapons were needed, prosecutors said. The men would have carried out their plan to hurt government employees and their families if they hadn't been arrested, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mervyn Mosbacker said. Wise and Grebe were accused of concocting the plan to threaten government officials with e-mails. One e-mail, sent June 12, was titled "Declaration of War" and a second one, sent June 26, said government workers had been "targeted for destruction by revenge." A third defendant, Oliver Dean Emigh, 63, was acquitted on all counts. He was accused of writing the June 12 message, but the charges against the men stemmed from the June 26 e-mail.

I got a copy a few days ago from the Omega Foundation and had an article about it in NRC Handelsblad today. This second report has interesting information about the so called EU-FBI global surveillance plan. According to a secret memorandum the EU countries have agreed with the FBI to intercept all European datacommunication. To do this some EU countries like Holland and Germany changed their laws to make broad wiretapping and interception of Internet and other datacommunication possible. Germany changed its constitution in the beginning of this year and in Holland a law was made and accepted by both chambers of the
Parliament that obliges all firms with computer and communication networks (providers, telco's, newspapers etc.) to make their systems tappable. You can read the second report at:

The rationale of the FOIA to NSA for TEMPEST docs is that
due to increased public awareness of that technology,
the manufacturers of classified TEMPEST products and services are chomping at the bit to sell them to a broader
public market -- as with other dual-use technology like
We were asked to make the FOIA by those who've gotten
what they can from the many sources listed at Joel McNamara's
TEMPEST site -- which show that the market is growing but
is still hampered by classified restrictions:
   Yes, it's improbably that NSA will release all the docs requested
but perhaps some will be shaken loose, again as with other
once classified technology like crypto. In part because of
rising public awareness, in part because of manufacturers'
desire, in part because NSA will have developed more advanced technology.
Tim has heretofore advised on TEMPEST measures and the
latest are useful, and correspond to what's available in the
commercial market and what is available in mil/gov pubs --
many listed at Joel's site.
We are working on our desktop model with a manufacturer
who supplies RF-protected glass for government and industry
rooms as well as for entire buildings. We figure that if we can
make a workable model, we'll be able to use to demonstrate
to our clients why TEMPEST protection is needed and how it
can be accomplished in an elegant design manner, paralleling
demonstrations used by the glass manufacturer to substantiate
claims for his products.
One of the many things that keeps techies from getting the public's

is truly desirable. Thus comes the marketer, who has skills of
invention of another sort to charm the skeptical consumer that
this baby has got to be a part of his/her life -- like fancy homes,
medical care, insurance cars, clothing, foods, weapons, bibles, and, above all, national security.
So a mongerer's brew is needed to peddle these inessentials,
composed of seriousness, humor, terror, lies and pretended
guilelessness, the practices of anyone doing well or doing badly, indeed, humans going about whatever they do to fill up the void.
BTW, the best technology is nearly always going to be classified, with sky high prices paid for by gullible citizens to calm their manufactured terrors (the religion model, once churches and temples
now weapons and satellites; once the priest/architect hustle, now
that of the the NatSec wonk/scientist), so the commercial market is only going to offer less than the best, the declassified waste products, while selling it as "The Best."
So we're seeking the crumbs from the NatSec table. And will use
what we get or don't get in our marketing campaign, having learned
the immortally favorite scheme: a mix of fact, fiction and fixation
on getting people to trust the seller, not the always waste promise.
But Tim knows that, practices that like a master, makes bundles.

@_subject: NYC Smartcards Die 
Chase, Visa and Mastercard have closed down their
smartcard trial on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the NYT reports today.
It also says Mondex has closed its Swindon trial.
The problem in NY is that the system was too cumbersome
to use, needing special readers that were not always up to
snuff, compared to the familiar and reliable system for credit cards. Bribing users with start up cash didn't work either.
No one ever reloaded their cards. Not all merchants took them,
especially those handling only cash transactions.
Also, the cards could not be used outside the trial area, and
the paper says, "everybody leaves the Upper West Side,"
without saying where they go to kill time for the day like
out of work Koreans who dare not admit the sublimity
of being jobless at long last -- money cannot buy the joy.
Spokespersons say that they misjudged the customer's desire
for cash-like freedom and anonymity (my words). That the best prospect for smartcard future lies in captive users such as college campuses and the military where they expect an all-purpose card will catch on by providing handy ID and money, as well as (unsaid) perfect monitoring and data-gathering.
I'll keep my $12-balance card (never found a place to accept it) on the chance that it will be a valuable collector's item for the Edsel Electronic Opium Museum.
And we never leave the Upper West Side, well, once, to go to
the Harvard Club for a swell DCSNY. Great group, grim dump.

NYT reports today on a new book, "Blind Man's Bluff,"
which reports on the US's success at placing surveillance devices on Soviet subsea communications cables around the world. With much technical detail about how it was done, beginning with the simple but overlooked idea of locating shoreline warning signs about undersea cables then tracking from there.
The devices, some up to 20 feet long for housing elaborate processing equipment, captured electronic emanations, thereby eluding detection measures aimed at physical taps. One was found by the Soviets but  most were not and much information on the program is still classified.
AT&T and Bell labs built many of them. The US Navy will not comment on the book, citing national security restrictions.
The Times also has an obituary for Tommy Flowers, the gent who guided construction of Colossus machines at Bletchley Park to break top-level German codes during WW II.
There's still interesting debate about the Paul Dore story of
picking up signals from space, which he first thought were from
aliens, but which seems more likely to be from a surveillance
satellite, and possibly from a type not publicly known. Not enough
data yet to show that the story is not a hoax, or disinformation by
US/UK spy agencies, but it has led to informative discussion of what such signals could indicate. Notes on this at:
   More commentary welcome, here or privately.
Some will recall a vigorous discussion here a few years back
about listening in on US undersea cables, commencing at the
landfall points (dense packs of them here in the NYC area), many handily marked on coastal seafaring maps.

On his most recent speaking tour of Europe, at which he promoted PGP v 6, Phil Zimmermann assured us categorically that NAI had at
his insistence withdrawn from the KRA.
It now appears that either (1) he lied to us (2) he was himself
lied to by NAI management or (3) NAI has rejoined.
You marketed version 6 of your product on the back of a claim that
you'd left the KRA. Yet NAI is now listed on the KRA website as a
member, and this is clearly doing your product material harm. Either
it's not true that you're a member, in which case your lawyers will be
able to extract so much money from KRA that it goes out of business,
whereupon the world will cheer and buy your product, or it is true, in
which case the damage will continue.
There is a deeper issue for the community here. For many years we have
tended to trust products because we know the technical people
involved. This has been the foundation for trust of other kinds. For
example, some years ago, a certain country's foreign ministry asked me
for a reference on Entrust prior to buying their products; my response
was that I knew both Paul van Oorschot and Mike Wiener, and in my
opinion they were both very competent. As a result of this, purchasing
decisions may have been taken with a significant effect on national
intelligence, economic competitiveness and even military preparedness.
As the country in question is a NATO member, its diplomatic comsec (or
lack of it) affects the UK directly.
Now, in one weekend, we have two cases where assurances from credible
technical people turned out to be unsatisfactory. Where does that
leave us?
Since I gave that reference for Entrust, the University here has
tightened up on liability. We must take care not to give references
that are untruthful or even misleading. We are urged to err on the
side of caution. So next time a foreign ministry asks me whether
Entrust products are kosher, I probably have to reply:
`You cannot prudently trust any third party to sell you trustworthy
comsec products. Recall Britain's selling old Enigmas to allies in the
Commonwealth; think of the fuss over red-threading; check out the
trapdoor in Sesame; and read up on key escrow. The only way you can
get good kit is if you build it yourself.  If you don't have the
skills, then I suggest you get some bright graduates to check out our
PhD programme - see '

, a crypto type who works for PGP was forwarded to the
ukcrypto list by Ian Goodyer (uk-crypto list admin).  Not sure where
it was posted originally, or perhaps Will asked Ian to forwarded it.
Hash: SHA1
I've commented about this on this list before I believe.  This appears
to be a case of really old news suddenly being dredged up for no
apparent wholesome reason -- which strikes me as quite odd because
Wired was apparently so eager to break this ancient story that they
didn't wait to ask anyone from NAI about it.
NAI being listed on the KRA page is *solely* a result of our TIS
acquisition.  I really doubt anyone here actually called some KRA
person and officially renewed our membership.  Frankly, I doubt anyone
here actually knows who to talk to there -- if there even is a
"there".  As I have said before, due to the TIS acquisition, NAI now
has a bunch of products which contain key escrow features. Eliminating or modifying these features such that they work in a less
big brother-like fashion will take significant time -- indeed entire
TIS products were based around managing key escrow infrastructures. Don't get me wrong, TIS had a lot of other great products, but it will
take time to redesign and rethink some of them in the context of
export and key escrow.  I'm not sure there's much point in withdrawing
from KRA when those products still exist.
These issues have no effect whatsoever on the PGP group.  As always,
we continue to publish full source code which effectively solves all
the export issues for us.

@_subject: NSA on OS Flaws 
An NSA team presented at NISSC98 in October
"The Inevitability of Failure: The Flawed Assumption of Security in Modern Computing Environments:"
    (62K)
  Abstract
  Although public awareness of the need for security in   computing systems is growing rapidly, current efforts   to provide security are unlikely to succeed. Current   security efforts suffer from the flawed assumption   that adequate security can be provided in applications   with the existing security mechanisms of mainstream   operating systems. In reality, the need for secure   operating systems is growing in today's computing   environment due to substantial increases in connectivity   and data sharing. The goal of this paper is to motivate   a renewed interest in secure operating systems so that   future security efforts may build on a solid foundation.   This paper identifies several secure operating system   features which are lacking in mainstream operating   systems, argues that these features are necessary to   adequately protect general application-space security   mechanisms, and provides concrete examples of how   current security solutions are critically dependent on   these features.
  Keywords: secure operating systems, mandatory security,   trusted path, Java, Kerberos, IPSEC, SSL, firewalls.
The paper advocates greater research on vulnerabilities
of operating systems which allow malicious attackers to
circumvent application-level security, including cryptographic protection. Ways to get around hardware
and software crypto are outlined.
Covert channels are a prime concern, as well as benign
use inadverdently allowing malicious intrusion.
An extensive list of references trace the twenty-five year history of OS flaws and examine why so little has been done to correct known deficiencies which undermine seemingly unbreachable applications.
Readings about DTOS, Fluke, Flash and other developments
of the NSA-sponsored Synergy program are illuminating.
The recent republication of early compsec documents by
CSRC is appropriate to this topic, particularly, "Subversion:
The Neglected Aspect of Computer Security," by Philip Myer,
June 1980, a thesis at NPS:
   Not that NSA would ever exploit OS weaknesses not warned Thanks to JM/RH for pointing to the NISSC papers.

@_subject: CJ Update 
Received today by e-mail:
November 16, 1998
Springfield, Missouri
Outlaw (name of his last album)
I saw CJ today at the Springfield facility for the
criminally disturbing. We spent five hours, a lot of
laughing, a little crying, and talking, with lots of
cameras and mikes on us. The controllers would not
let me take notes!
First, CJ's great hope and request to his friends is
to hang in there with him. He intends to go all the
way with this to trial, being his own defense lawyer,
even though he believes that since the Feds know they
will lose, they will try to get him to plea bargain
down to "walking his dog without a leash" as he puts
it. He is definitely on a mission.  He received
John's package, nothing from Declan. He has received
about half the mail I sent him. They are reading his
mail to his lawyers, supposedly forbidden.
CJ has been without glasses and without his teeth for
the whole time since he was arrested. JEFF GORDON
STILL HAS CJ'S TEETH. However, his vision has
improved! He is also without proper medication for
his Tourette's. The shrink told him that the
amphetamines he had been prescribed and which were
working well would probably be stolen by the staff
anyway. CJ is very conscious of managing his
neurological condition, with coffee, sugar, fasting,
and self-control. He does complain that he was so
pleased with himself that he got through his last
rage attack without hurting himself or acting it out
that he punched a wall in celebration and hurt his
hand! Even though he is supposed to be his own lawyer, he
has not even been informed about his indictment nor
has he been informed about anything else about his
At Springfield he has been in lockup for things that
he purportedly did at the Florence, Arizona prison.
The shrink gets a message this past weekend that
suddenly I am coming down, and this morning before I
get there he rushes in to tell CJ he's finally moving
him out of lockup into the open ward! Wolfson later
tells me that over two weeks ago he notified the
federal marshalls that CJ can be moved back to
Arizona, but he had not told CJ that.  I don't know
whether it's true.  He actually took me to task for
coming on such short notice.
CJ was very happy that the things he has sent out
have been posted, and it is clear that the support of
the cypherpunks community is important to him.
He did not talk to me about particular defense
strategies for obvious reasons.
He did indicate that the story that I relayed to John
about the incident in the federal courthouse in
Estevan involving a supposed gasoline "bomb"  (a
version of which incident was part of a story by
Declan) was a surprise to him;  he seemed both surprised and amused about what actions had been
attributed to him. To say I know and understand
nothing about this incident is an understatement. I
mention  it only because it is part of Jeff Gordon's
original complaint, a significant part I assume since
CJ has never been known to do physical injury to a
human being.
CJ has not seen the stories by Declan nor what has
been posted; I sent a hundred pages of stuff to Larry
Dowling his Austin lawyer, including copies of
Declan's articles. I had not sent these things to CJ
on the assumption that they would be censored. CJ
suggested that I ask Dowling to sent them with the
instruction on the envelope "open in the presence of
the inmate only". Again, he wants to see these things
because  his spirit is hanging on the support from
John and the rest of the community, although he said
very clearly that he is doing this on his own and
would do it alone if he had to.
Just before I left to come here, having finally been
cleared as a visitor, I got a call from Linda Lou
Reed, saying that she had not done a couple of things
needed to get his music CD together, since she has
been out of town. CJ and I talked about how to get
this together and I will work on it with other Tucson
friends. Someone had the idea of selling the CD's to
support a legal defense fund. I will report progress
as it occurs. And speaking of legal defense support, thanks to John
and others who made suggestions about legal support.
After many hours of discussion the family decided
that it was not the most intelligent thing to put up
the meagre family fortunes against the federal
government, and therefore we intend at this point to
trust CJ's defense to his stated (and historically
effective) plan to be his own defense, or to public
defenders. With some trepidation I brought this up to
CJ, and he was relieved; he said that he had been
worried that we would try to pay for a defense in
this case, which again he intends to push all the way
through no matter what compromises are offered to
him, and that our paying for his defense was not what
he wanted. Therefore I would like to put out to those who know
the situation to help CJ to obtain relevant legal
information and consultation as he goes into this, in
whatever form it is available.  If there are costs
that I personally can afford to support, I am happy
to. CJ has made repeated requests for access to legal
books at Springfield, and they disappear into
nowhere, no yes, no no. An interesting point:  CJ related that Dr. Wolfson
had asked him about his filing of IRS tax forms!  As
if they were on a fishing expedition looking for
other things to get CJ on, as they did with Jim Bell.
I confronted Wolfson about this, asking how it was
relevant to the issue Wolfson was supposed to be
investigating, which is CJ's competence to understand
the charges against him and to stand trial.  At that
exact moment he jumped up and said that he urgently
needed to answer a page which he had received five
minutes before. I overheard the conversation which he
had suddenly urgently to engage in, and it was a
trivial conversation about returning a copy of a
document to someone. But when he returned to me he
said "Well I have three reasons for having asked
that." Already suspicious, to have three reasons. The
main reason Wolfson said was that CJ says he has
attention deficient disorder (ADD) associated with
the Tourette's, and that asking if someone filed
taxes was a good indicator of their attention span!
(Could I be making this up?) I said, why not pick
something like, can you make it through the college
registration process? He replied, "I'm not used to
working with educated people."  Other "reasons" he
gave:  1) I want to give a thorough medical,
psychological, social and legal picture as part of my
judgment whether someone is capable of understanding
the charges against him, because if I leave
significant things out of my report I am more likely
to be receiving a subpoena to wherever CJ is being
tried, and that's inconvenient for me; and 2) there
are all these wacko people who question the authority
of government to levy taxes, put people to trial,
etc., and I need to determine whether he's one of
those and therefore suffering as part of a mass
delusion (his words)... he lost me there a little
bit. I didn't know whether that would be evidence of
sanity or insanity.
Anyway he seems to be sending off CJ into the next
stage with a report that CJ might have Tourette's, is
not schizophrenic, and in his experience is not
CJ does have some mighty interesting observations
about how things are done in this federal nuthouse
situation, which god willing we will all get to hear
someday. Meanwhile he has sent out certain
information to Declan on specific incidents in the
facility which he observed,  but is concerned that it
was not received.
Our expectation is that CJ will be returned to Tucson
and then extradited to Washington, but clearly as a
form of harrassment the marshalls are taking their
own sweet time about everything.
CJ's "case manager" at Springfeld is Bob Harris. The
phone number there is 417 862 7041, and CJ's prisoner
number is 05987-196. Any correspondence to anywhere
in the prison system needs to have that number on it.
John Bogart in Tucson  (520 624 8196) is the public
defender in CJ's local case, pending his extradition
to Washington state.  The family retained Larry
Dowling in Austin, a very old friend of CJ's and his
lawyer for a long time, for a small amount to look
after CJ's rights during incarceration; we have not
retained him to go the full way in this defense, for
the reasons stated above.  Supposedly John Bogart
will be informed when the marshalls actually choose
to move CJ (after the fact).  Therefore I suggest
that those who want to write to CJ write him soon and
by fast mail at U.S. Medical Center, POB Box 4000, Springfield, Missouri 65801.   Larry Dowling's
address is 606 West 11th, Austin, 78701. I assume he
might be willing  to forward it to CJ on the
assumption that CJ will in fact be moved. Larry has
been a true friend throughout this and past
CJ has said that since he has been incarcerated for

greatest fear is that he will do something that will
justify involuntary drug administration, and he will
be defeated in that way. He is also afraid that he
will simply be killed in prison.
However, all in all I found CJ in pretty good
spirits, and clearly feeling "on purpose" vis a vis
his goals with his cypherpunk activities. I related
to him during our talk that one of my sons just took
some time off from university so that he would have
time to actually read, and that he had accurately
predicted to his friends exactly how I would respond
to the news: "Honey, I'm so proud!" CJ said that's
how I seemed to feel now about his arrest.  It is,
finally. I trust that CJ, in spite of a pattern of
sometimes shooting himself in the foot, is
brilliantly inspired by important libertarian values
and goals. I appreciate the education and inspiration
I have gained from getting to know this side of his
life and some of the people, technologies, issues and
ideas of which previously I had only vague notions.

@_subject: CJ Update Corrected 
This is attorney protected information.
Received today by e-mail:
November 16, 1998
Springfield, Missouri
Outlaw (name of his last album)
I saw CJ today at the Springfield facility for the
criminally disturbing. We spent five hours, a lot of
laughing, a little crying, and talking, with lots of
cameras and mikes on us. The controllers would not
let me take notes!
First, CJ's great hope and request to his friends is
to hang in there with him. He intends to go all the
way with this to trial, being his own defense lawyer,
even though he believes that since the Feds know they
will lose, they will try to get him to plea bargain
down to "walking his dog without a leash" as he puts
it. He is definitely on a mission.  He received
John's package, nothing from Declan. He has received
about half the mail I sent him. They are reading his
mail to his lawyers, supposedly forbidden.
CJ has been without glasses and without his teeth for
the whole time since he was arrested. JEFF GORDON
STILL HAS CJ'S TEETH. However, his vision has
improved! He is also without proper medication for
his Tourette's. The shrink told him that the
amphetamines he had been prescribed and which were
working well would probably be stolen by the staff
anyway. CJ is very conscious of managing his
neurological condition, with coffee, sugar, fasting,
and self-control. He does complain that he was so
pleased with himself that he got through his last
rage attack without hurting himself or acting it out
that he punched a wall in celebration and hurt his
hand! Even though he is supposed to be his own lawyer, he
has not even been informed about his indictment nor
has he been informed about anything else about his
At Springfield he has been in lockup for things that
he purportedly did at the Florence, Arizona prison.
The shrink gets a message this past weekend that
suddenly I am coming down, and this morning before I
get there he rushes in to tell CJ he's finally moving
him out of lockup into the open ward! Wolfson later
tells me that over two weeks ago he notified the
federal marshalls that CJ can be moved back to
Arizona, but he had not told CJ that.  I don't know
whether it's true.  He actually took me to task for
coming on such short notice.
CJ was very happy that the things he has sent out
have been posted, and it is clear that the support of
the cypherpunks community is important to him.
He did not talk to me about particular defense
strategies for obvious reasons.
He did indicate that the story that I relayed to John
about the incident in the federal courthouse in
Estevan involving a supposed gasoline "bomb"  (a
version of which incident was part of a story by
Declan) was a surprise to him;  he seemed both surprised and amused about what actions had been
attributed to him. To say I know and understand
nothing about this incident is an understatement. I
mention  it only because it is part of Jeff Gordon's
original complaint, a significant part I assume since
CJ has never been known to do physical injury to a
human being.
CJ has not seen the stories by Declan nor what has
been posted; I sent a hundred pages of stuff to Larry
Dowling his Austin lawyer, including copies of
Declan's articles. I had not sent these things to CJ
on the assumption that they would be censored. CJ
suggested that I ask Dowling to sent them with the
instruction on the envelope "open in the presence of
the inmate only". Again, he wants to see these things
because  his spirit is hanging on the support from
John and the rest of the community, although he said
very clearly that he is doing this on his own and
would do it alone if he had to.
Just before I left to come here, having finally been
cleared as a visitor, I got a call from Linda Lou
Reed, saying that she had not done a couple of things
needed to get his music CD together, since she has
been out of town. CJ and I talked about how to get
this together and I will work on it with other Tucson
friends. Someone had the idea of selling the CD's to
support a legal defense fund. I will report progress
as it occurs. And speaking of legal defense support, thanks to John
and others who made suggestions about legal support.
After many hours of discussion the family decided
that it was not the most intelligent thing to put up
the meagre family fortunes against the federal
government, and therefore we intend at this point to
trust CJ's defense to his stated (and historically
effective) plan to be his own defense, or to public
defenders. With some trepidation I brought this up to
CJ, and he was relieved; he said that he had been
worried that we would try to pay for a defense in
this case, which again he intends to push all the way
through no matter what compromises are offered to
him, and that our paying for his defense was not what
he wanted. Therefore I would like to put out to those who know
the situation to help CJ to obtain relevant legal
information and consultation as he goes into this, in
whatever form it is available.  If there are costs
that I personally can afford to support, I am happy
to. CJ has made repeated requests for access to legal
books at Springfield, and they disappear into
nowhere, no yes, no no. An interesting point:  CJ related that Dr. Wolfson
had asked him about his filing of IRS tax forms!  As
if they were on a fishing expedition looking for
other things to get CJ on, as they did with Jim Bell.
I confronted Wolfson about this, asking how it was
relevant to the issue Wolfson was supposed to be
investigating, which is CJ's competence to understand
the charges against him and to stand trial.  At that
exact moment he jumped up and said that he urgently
needed to answer a page which he had received five
minutes before. I overheard the conversation which he
had suddenly urgently to engage in, and it was a
trivial conversation about returning a copy of a
document to someone. But when he returned to me he
said "Well I have three reasons for having asked
that." Already suspicious, to have three reasons. The
main reason Wolfson said was that CJ says he has
attention deficient disorder (ADD) associated with
the Tourette's, and that asking if someone filed
taxes was a good indicator of their attention span!
(Could I be making this up?) I said, why not pick
something like, can you make it through the college
registration process? He replied, "I'm not used to
working with educated people."  Other "reasons" he
gave:  1) I want to give a thorough medical,
psychological, social and legal picture as part of my
judgment whether someone is capable of understanding
the charges against him, because if I leave
significant things out of my report I am more likely
to be receiving a subpoena to wherever CJ is being
tried, and that's inconvenient for me; and 2) there
are all these wacko people who question the authority
of government to levy taxes, put people to trial,
etc., and I need to determine whether he's one of
those and therefore suffering as part of a mass
delusion (his words)... he lost me there a little
bit. I didn't know whether that would be evidence of
sanity or insanity.
Anyway he seems to be sending off CJ into the next
stage with a report that CJ might have Tourette's, is
not schizophrenic, and in his experience is not
CJ does have some mighty interesting observations
about how things are done in this federal nuthouse
situation, which god willing we will all get to hear
someday. Meanwhile he has sent out certain
information to Declan on specific incidents in the
facility which he observed,  but is concerned that it
was not received.
Our expectation is that CJ will be returned to Tucson
and then extradited to Washington, but clearly as a
form of harrassment the marshalls are taking their
own sweet time about everything.
CJ's "case manager" at Springfeld is Bob Harris. The
phone number there is 417 862 7041, and CJ's prisoner
number is 05987-196. Any correspondence to anywhere
in the prison system needs to have that number on it.
John Bogart in Tucson  (520 624 8196) is the public
defender in CJ's local case, pending his extradition
to Washington state.  The family retained Larry
Dowling in Austin, a very old friend of CJ's and his
lawyer for a long time, for a small amount to look
after CJ's rights during incarceration; we have not
retained him to go the full way in this defense, for
the reasons stated above.  Supposedly John Bogart
will be informed when the marshalls actually choose
to move CJ (after the fact).  Therefore I suggest
that those who want to write to CJ write him soon and
by fast mail at U.S. Medical Center, POB Box 4000, Springfield, Missouri 65801.   Larry Dowling's
address is 606 West 11th, Austin, 78701. I assume he
might be willing  to forward it to CJ on the
assumption that CJ will in fact be moved. Larry has
been a true friend throughout this and past
CJ has said that since he has been incarcerated for
three months now with no indication to him as to
formal charges, it is time to act to get him out of
Springfield. I concur, and unless I hear within a

cypherpunk friends up on their offer to begin to

@_subject: National Security KRA Framework 
These are excerpts from US Patent 5835596: "International
cryptography framework" issued on November 10, 1998, to
inventors Keith S. Klemba, Santa Clara, CA, and Roger
Merckling, Gieres, France and assigned to Hewlett Packard. Source: It's an update of US Patent 5651068 issued for the same
methodology in July, 1997. Summaries of the patents are
also available at <  >.
INTERNATIONAL CRYPTOGRAPHY FRAMEWORK
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The invention provides a four-part technology framework
that supports international cryptography, which includes a
national flag card, a cryptographic unit, a host system, and a
network security server. Three of the four service elements
have a fundamentally hierarchical relationship. The National
Flag Card (NFC) is installed in the Cryptographic Unit (CU)
which, in turn, is installed into a Host System (HS).
Cryptographic instructions on the Host system cannot be
executed without a Cryptographic Unit, which itself requires
the present of a valid National Flag Card before its services
are available. The fourth service element, a Network
Security Server (NSS), can provide a range of different
security services including verification of the other three
service elements.
The framework supports the design, implementation, and
operational elements of any and all national policies, while
unifying the design, development, and operation of
independent national security policies. The invention thus
gives standard form to the service elements of national
security policies, where such service elements include such
things as hardware from factors, communication protocols,
and on-line and off-line data definitions. [Snip drawing and
detailed descriptions.]
APPLICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK
The invention has various applications. In particular, the
framework is ideally suited for various national security
schemes and operates consistently across a variety of local
laws. For example the framework could be used to support a
key escrow policy. Key escrowing is a process where the
keys or family keys used for cryptography are kept by a third
party, in the national context, typically a government agency.
This allows the third party to decrypt information when, for
example, a law enforcement agency is required to see the
contents of an encrypted message.
For example if the policy of nation-X requires key escrow,
then when nation-X NFC's are put into circulation they
contain a key escrowed by nation-X. Law enforcement
would be able to use the electronic stamp on a message to
determine that the message was encrypted under the policy
of nation-X. It would also be able to determine unique
identification information of the specific NFC used to enable
the CU. If nation-X agrees to cooperate, the escrowed key
for the NFC involved may be obtained to decrypt the
suspicious message.
The actual encryption algorithm used in nation-X may be the
same encryption algorithm that is used in nation-Z, such that
when a user from nation-X visits nation-Z it is only
necessary to put a NFC from nation-Z into the CU. The
encryption algorithm in the CU remains the same, but what
is governing the use of cryptography is the policy of nation-
Z. For example, the policy of nation-Z may require a trap
door, such that the government of nation-Z is able to take a
back door into the users system to read the deciphered text.
In this case the nation-Z NFC provides a back door rather
than an escrowed key to law enforcement. Several such
schemes are known in the art and it is a feature of the
invention that the framework is readily adapted to
accommodate such schemes as may be implemented in a
particular national policy without affecting the basic
hardware, or data structures of a user system, with the
exception of the NFC.
Thus, the encryption algorithms in CU may be the same
encryption algorithms used everywhere. The NFCs control
the use of these encryption algorithms in accordance with
the local law. Because the NSS is a trusted third party that
validates proper local use of the framework, it is not
possible to use cryptography unless a locally accepted NFC
is installed in the CU. In the example above, even though the
encryption engine operates properly in nation-X, it would
not operate in nation-Z unless the NFC was replaced with a nation-Z's NFC. For international communication of
encrypted information, (e.g. where an encrypted message is
generated in nation-Z and sent to nation-X) the involvement
of cryptography for such messages will be independently
controlled by two NFCs -- the X flag card in nation-X and
the Z-flag card in nation-Z. The invention therefore offers
the ability to support government policy, whatever that
policy may be, and still provide uniform cryptographic
In addition to the nationalization issues that are illustrated
above, within a certain nation there may be multiple
encryption policies (e.g. nation-X might have a policy for
banking that is more liberal than its policy for
manufacturing). Accordingly, the framework is adapted to
operate within each country under several different national
policies, or with several different levels of encryption. For
example, just as there are different stamps for first class and
priority mail, the framework may allow for different levels
of encryption based on the type of NFC installed.
It is a feature of the framework that CUs may have the major
standard encryption algorithms built-in (e.g. DES, RSA,
DSS, MD5). However, it is also possible to install custom
algorithms into the CU providing that the policy in the
governing NFC permits this type of activity. Software
algorithms can be transferred completely or partially into the
CU from either the NFC or the NSS. Hardware algorithms
can be added to the CU via the NFC. The actual encryption
of a message may involve the NFC, CU, or NSS, or any
combination thereof. As soon as the NFC is removed from
the CU these custom algorithms are no longer operative,
perhaps not even present, in the CU.

Ex-CIA head John Deutch and two NatSecs write in November
Foreign Affairs on "Catastrophic Terrorism: Tackling the New

They propose three new orgs to prevent and respond to terrorist
use of WMD on a large scale:
1. National Terrorism Intelligence Center (Mil/Intel/LEA)
2. National Information Assurance Institute (Gov/Corp/Tank)
3. Catastrophic Terrorism Response Offices (Intel/Plan/Train/Task/Direct)
Paralleling Senator Kyl and others, the proposals are based
on the increased domestic use of the military while proclaiming
civil liberties will be protected. And though there is considerable
detail about how the military, intelligence agencies and
law enforcement will work together - US and foreign - and the
vast purchases of sevices and equipment that will be needed, there's next to nothing about how civil liberties will be protected.
Reference is made to America's marshalling its patriotism and technology to win the Cold War, and the wondrous inventions
developed to do that. Again, though, no mention is made of the
price of military industrialism, which is to be expected of our
finest catastrophe-obessessed minds unable to imagine a world without endless national security threats to grow their pork.

@_subject: KRA on NAI/KRA 
Phil and Cabe,
For your info. Response will be very welcome.
Hash: SHA1
I have some questions about the KRA.
1. In your FAQ , you state that one of the
organization's goals is to:
  "Serve as a focal point for industry efforts to develop commercially
   acceptable solutions for recovery of encrypted information"
This seems to allow that there may be valid encrypted _data_ recovery
methods other than _key_ recovery using the KRA's "common key recovery
block" (still under discussion). However, I'm not aware of the KRA's public
position on the recovery of plaintext using cryptographically sound and
ethically responsible alternatives to the escrowing of keys in
organizational situations, e.g. PGP's Additional Decryption Key (ADK)
mechanism. What is the KRA's public position on PGP's ADK?
2. A public debate has recently arisen because the KRA website's member
roster indicates that Network Associates (NAI) is a member of the KRA. NAI
representatives, however, have publicly contraindicated this. Can you
clarify NAI's membership status in the KRA, specifically:
A. On what date (if ever) did NAI apply for membership in the KRA?
B. Is the KRA in possession of any evidence (letter, etc) to show that NAI
    was or is a member of the KRA?
C. If NAI was a member of the KRA at any time, on what date did a
    corporate officer of NAI formally withdraw NAI from the KRA, if ever?
D. Regarding KRA membership policy, if a company is not a member itself
    but acquires another company that is a KRA member, but, does
    this acquisition automatically confer membership status on the parent
    company, or is a formal request to "expand" the company's membership
    necessary?
E. If NAI was not a member of the KRA at the time of its Trusted
    Information Systems (TIS) acquisition, did the KRA receive a request
    from any NAI representative to expand TIS's membership to all of NAI?
3. KRA member companies are listed with their web URLs, but no individual
contact name/phone/email is provided for any of them. Can you supply a
complete listing of the designated contacts (corporate representatives) at
each of the KRA member organizations, should one want to discuss with them
their respective companies' KR positions or proposals? For example, if, in
fact, the KRA website is correct to list NAI as a member, then who is NAI's
official KRA representative?
Thank you in advance for your prompt clarification.

The KRA's prompt reply (signed by me to indicate what I received):
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Mr. Del Torto,
Thank you for your inquiry about a KRA member company. I am member of the
Alliance's secretariat staff addressing their business and administrative
needs. This puts me in a position to answer some of your questions directly.
Others I will pass along to appropriate Alliance member representatives for
About the KRA's public position on PGP's ADK, obviously it was not
adequately addressed for your needs in the Alliance's existing materials. I
will ask a more appropriate and knowledgeable spokesperson to respond to
your questions and concerns.
Concerning Network Associates membership in the KRA, in response to your
question I have verified that our files contain an executed Membership
Agreement for Network Associates (dated July 2, 1998), as well as a properly
completed Application for Membership of that same date. As an aside, the KRA has retained our firm to manage their business and
administrative affairs. Our business is solely the management of industry
associations. Thus, we have no conflict of interest as our clients are the
'associations' themselves and not any of the individual member companies.
For the management of our client associations (currently 4) we employ
certain practice standards. One important practice area is the impartial
recognition of membership. Simply put, we exercise no discretionary judgment
about whether a company is a member or not. If a company completes the
required steps to become a member (execute an agreement, complete an
application and pay the appropriate dues) they become a member. In other
words, membership is binary...complete all the steps --> become a member;
omit any of these steps --> NOT a member.
Ever since the the Alliance was formally constituted as a California
nonprofit corporation (October 1997), rigorous application processes have
been in place. It is true that a number of companies, including NAI I
believe, were attending meetings under the name of the KRA during much of
1997. However, until the Alliance was formally constituted, involving
membership agreements, applications and payment of dues, it's not entirely
accurate to characterize those companies participating in 1997 as 'members'
of the Alliance. Indeed, some of this current 'public debate' about NAI's
relationship with the KRA goes back to their public statement that they
'withdrew' from the organization. The fact of the matter is that they simply
did not choose to become an actual member at the time the organization was
formally constituted. When it was reported that they withdrew, there was in
fact no entity from which to withdraw. Regarding the listing of individual representatives from member companies,
it is the Alliance's policy not to do this. For whatever it's worth, this is
a standard practice of industry associations. I am passing your message
along to the designated NAI representative and inviting him to respond. At the risk of stating the obvious, it is not uncommon for companies in any
industry, especially hi-tech, to have multiple opinions within their
management teams. And, to have these opinions expressed in public forums. It
has been my experience that it is dangerous to infer corporate and product
strategies from a companies membership in industry groups. Companies join
industry associations for all manner of reasons, not all of which they share
with the market. I'm not suggesting any thing other than the fact that our
industry makes for extremely "complex business" and there's no reason to
believe that this complexity of actions, strategies and motivations isn't
going to appear in a company's involvement in industry associations. Sorry for the length of this reply. However, it's clear that there are a
great many concerns behind your questions and I've tried to reach those
concerns. I hope this response has been useful to you. Michael LoBue

     "8. The WA agreed control list amendments to take into account   recent technological developments. The amendments to the lists   included elimination of coverage of commonly available civil   telecommunications equipment as well as the modernisation of   encryption controls to keep pace with developing technology and   electronic commerce, while also being mindful of security interests.   Participating States also discussed the potential need for the WA   and national export control authorities to respond quickly and   effectively to the emergence of new technologies."
Which appears to confirm that each state will implement and
announce its encryption policy as it sees fit. The US has jumped
to proclaim to its constituencies that it has won.
Though it's the secret agreements that remain to be publicized.
Note the gaps in the public docs and dissimulative assurances.

It will go well beyond what has been heretofore generally agreed to by the member states under which there was a good bit of latitude for each to determine its own policy. This is an unprecedented united

Peter Gutmann may be close to the truth about Echelon's role
in the Wassenaar changes.
The NYT reports today that the US is proposing to NATO a
combined intelligence center to combat use of Weapons of Mass
Destruction by rogue states and non-state terrorists like Usama
Bin Laden.
There is some dissent among the Europeans over the US's
attempt to frighten the populace with a new worldwide menace
to replace the boogies of the Cold War.
Still, it appears that intelligence on the threat of terrorist use of WMD is being whispered in ears of those holding out for
privacy protection. And a correlative threat of strong encryption
is surely part of those scenarios.
As in the US, it's probable that domestic restrictions on strong
crypto are being advanced to combat domestic terrorism in countries
around the world, following the precedent set during the Cold War,
which, as we all know was the evil parent of Wassenaar's predecessor
GAO put out a report (GGD-99-7) a few days ago on the FBI's expenditures for counterterrorism from 1995-98. It shows a dramatic increase year by year, with big leaps authorized by Congress following each "terrorist incident," for funds for a host of domestic agencies. GAO wonders (as does Congress which asked for the report) if it's all being put to beneficial effect. Its description of CT activities
carefully excludes the classified, and also omits the global efforts of US military

@_subject: AU WassenaarWassenaar changes 
[OK to repost to crypto lists and Cryptome - dant]
I spoke this afternoon with one of the Australian delegates at the
Wassenaar meeting, an official from the Dept of Foreign Affairs and Trade
Speaking off the record, they confirmed the changes at Wassenaar are pretty
much as we know already:
     - NEW CONTROLS on mass market crypto products (hardware and software);
     - DEREGULATING all weak encryption products using key lengths up to 56
     bits;
     - EXEMPTING mass market software where the key length is 64 bits or
     less;
     - EXTENDING the same mass market exemption to hardware for the first
     time;
     - EXCLUDING encryption products that protect intellectual property,
     such as digital watermarking;
     - NO DECISION was made about regulating 'intangible' distribution of
     technology, including Internet downloads.
Apparently in the short term the intangibles issue is being considered in
other fora (including the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) which includes
Australia thanks to Filthy Jabilucre et al).
It is still not clear whether the new restrictions are intended to stop
public domain software such as PGP*. The DFAT contact said there was no
discussion about an intention to stop public domain packages like PGP. They
did not think public domain was being restricted. Yet apparently the
Australian DoD has expressed the David Aaron view that public domain is
subject to the same restrictions as mass market.
* PGP is "in the public domain" for the purposes of Wassenaar/DSGL, since
the definition states:
     "in the public domain" (GTN NTN GSN), as it applies herein, means
     "technology" or "software" which has been made available without
     restrictions upon its further dissemination (copyright restrictions do
     not remove "technology" or "software" from being "in the public
     domain")
Note: there is no equivalent definition for "mass market", but the General
Software Note (GSN) states it thus:
     Generally available to the public by being:
        1. Sold from stock at retail selling points, without restriction,
        by means of:
          a. Over-the-counter transactions;
          b. Mail order transactions; or
          c. Telephone order transactions; and
        2. Designed for installation by the user without substantial
        support by the supplier;

Yep, mirrors of everything would be very large. We've heard already
that folks would like help in knowing what to mirror if they can't do
large archives, or can't easily decide which are most important. My advice so far: mirror whatever you can until better advice comes forth. Prime need: many mirrors of the strongest stuff, especially anything above 40-bits, that is anything that now requires a US export license (which appears
to be where Wassenaar wildebeests and the domestic US is being stampeded).

Response to a forward of John Gilmore's message to UK Crypto:
I would only add this caution.  I think John is wrong in giving legal advice that Wassenaar is not binding without implementing legislation.  That is an American approach to these matters. I believe that many, perhaps most, Wassenaar members derive their authority to regulate exports directly from the arrangement itself.  For that reason, I would not assume that everyone everywhere is free to ignore the new restrictions until some further law or regulation is promulgated.

Excerpt from a speech by BXA's William Reinsch on December 7, 1998, at the Practising Law Institute conference "Coping with U.S.
Export Controls." Note final paragraph about detailed crypto session today -- no report on that yet.
Full speech: Also by him yesterday on crypto: [Begin excerpt]
Encryption continues to be a hotly debated issue. As I stated last
year, the U.S. continues to support a balanced approach to encryption
policy which considers privacy and commercial interests as well as
protecting law enforcement and national security interests.
Furthermore, we also remain committed to promoting the growth of
global electronic commerce through secure financial and business
Our position has always been to seek industry-led, market-driven
solutions to achieve a balanced approach. What has changed is the
direction where technology and the market place are taking us. Key
recovery technology remains a very important part of our policy;
however, over the past two years, we have recognized that key recovery
is not a solution for all problems.
That recognition, brought about in part as a result of our ongoing
dialogue with industry, has helped us also focus on recoverable
technologies that can enable law enforcement to continue its
authorized activities.
As a result, on September 16, Vice President Gore unveiled a policy
update, which will not end the debate, but which does include steps to
further streamline exports of key recovery products and other
recoverable products which allow law enforcement, under proper legal
authority, recovery of plain text.
The update also provides for 1) the export of 56 bit DES worldwide to
any end user under a license exception; 2) exports of strong
encryption to U.S. companies and their subsidiaries under a license
exception; 3) exports of strong encryption to the insurance and
medical sectors in 45 countries under a license exception; and 4)
exports of strong encryption to secure on-line transactions between
on-line merchants and their customers in 45 countries under a license
exception. This is consistent with our earlier announcement relating
to financial institutions.
This is an evolutionary process and we intend to continue our
dialogue. We must continue to adapt to changes, and we will review our policies again within the year to determine whether further change is necessary. We intend to publish regulations implementing the Vice President's announcement this month.
With respect to developing a common international approach to
encryption policy, Ambassador David Aaron, our special envoy on
cryptography, is working with other countries to ensure that our
policies are compatible. He has found that most major producing
countries have public safety and national security concerns similar to ours and are interested in developing a harmonized international
approach regarding compatible infrastructures for electronic commerce
and for a key management infrastructure. At last week's Wassenaar
Arrangement plenary session, the participating states approved a
number of changes to modernize and improve multilateral encryption
export controls. These changes removed controls on products below 56 bits and on certain consumer entertainment systems, such as DVD
products, and on cordless phone systems designed for home or office
Most important, participating states agreed to extend controls to
mass-market encryption exports above 64 bits, thus closing a
significant loophole. This will enable governments to review the
dissemination of the strongest encryption products that otherwise
might fall into the hands of rogue end users.
For those of you deeply interested in the details of our encryption
policy, we have a specific session devoted to it tomorrow.

@_subject: LEA Interviews 
This is attorney protected information.
We've been having discussion with a legal person about being
interviewed by law enforcement officials and/or signing a statement. These comments are offered by permission (and might be coupled with DCF's advice of saying only "I Want a Lawyer"):
[Begin comments]
Sorry to be opaque - "impeachment" means, basically, making a witness lose credibility with the jury. The only use I've been able to imagine for wanting a written statement is to make you look bad, in the event that you are called by either side to testify, and end up testifying favorably to the defendant. If you
appear to be a "hostile witness", it's even possible that you can be impeached by the attorney/party who asked you to testify.
The scenario I see looks something like this - 1.	You're called as a defense witness to testify to the effect that you've been on the list for years, messages like the
defendants's weren't unique or especially unusual, that you understood them as satire or political commentary and not as actual threats, given the wider context in which they occurred. The general impression conveyed by your testimony is that you're a rational, reasonable, respectable person who the jury can like and trust, that you think the defendant is perhaps weird but basically misunderstood and harmless. 2.	The prosecution cross-examines you about your conclusions re the defendant - they're going to ask you how well you really knew/know him, how much you knew about his other behavior (they're likely to try to sneak in information about the defendant's other alleged misbehavior here, if they haven't already), and so forth. To the extent that you say you didn't know him, your direct testimony becomes less and less relevant - and if you start to
say that you did know him well, they're likely to produce the document you wrote/signed, and ask you a series of uncomfortable questions about it, designed to create the impression you were lying to the jury earlier during your testimony, e.g., if the statement says "I didn't know that the defendant had done these other creepy things, and they make me question whether or not I
know him very well, and I feel differently about his threats now that I know about those creepy things", the prosecutor will make a big production out of pointing out the differences between your testimony at trial and what you wrote during the LEA interrogation. Understandably, you probably wanted to distance yourself from the defendant when the LE agents were in your home, especially after they'd given you a list of creepy things he supposedly did - but they're going to hold you to the same degree of distance from him and his thoughts/actions if you end up testifying at trial. Writing it down and having you sign it serves several purposes - it gives the prosecutor a document s/he can wave around, ask you to read from, and otherwise organize a little production around - it also lets you be impeached with your own words, instead of calling the cops to the stand to dispute your recollection of your conversation, which takes on a "he said/she said" tone, and might make it look like the big mean cops were picking on poor
little you. If they can make poor little you eat his own words, they look good, and you look bad.
So .. that's what I'm afraid the document is for. I've been trying to think of something else - but especially where the agents asked you to pick out just key bits of your conversation, and assert that they're true, and let the rest of the information be lost to memory and time .. it makes me think the information they selected was important to them. The information they got seems helpful to them only in the context that you end up testifying at trial - I can't think of any other reason it would be useful to them. It sounds like the psychological factors of the questioning were pretty well
optimized to make you want (probably partly subconsciously) to distance yourself from the defendant, both to avoid implied guilt by association, and to maintain a common ground of reasonableness with the cops while discussing other things like politics. The current issue of the Utne Reader has a piece by the Unabomber's brother and his wife talking about how the FBI manipulated them into providing evidence against the Unabomber by appearing
sympathetic and reasonable, forming a common "us (good people) versus the actions of they crazy guy, who needs us to work together to help him get better" bond which was ultimately used to try to kill the crazy guy, to the horror of the brother/wife. While I do think that they may have pulled a fast one on you, I don't think that reflects badly on you as a person .. it's pretty difficult to tell which cops are actually reasonable people, and which are pretending to be reasonable people in order to further their own agendas.

   This is the first US major media story on Echelon, and its
connection to privacy invasion of a global celebrity icon may do more to get public attention for the vile program

NSA claims Diana was not a "target" and that the 1,000 pages
of data on her were gathered "incidental" to other activities. But, as with all the TLA snooping, it is this incidental surveillance of the innocent that all the calls for loosening of
encrypton controls  is about.

Its comparative review of surveillance law is informative

the evil tools.
Still, South Africa is joining the crowd in tightening controls on
technology by proposing that telecomm providers make their
systems accessible to government (at their own expense), emulating the recent US-EU snooping agreement advanced by the FBI and Europol.

Commerce Updates Export Controls on Encryption Products
(Washington, D.C.)     The Commerce Department will publish new regulations significantly streamlining government export controls on powerful encryption -- products that scramble computer data -- as part of the Clinton Administration initiatives to make government more efficient and enhance the global competitiveness of U.S. businesses. These amendments to the Export Administration Regulations, on public notice today at the Federal Register, end the need for licenses for powerful U.S. encryption products to companies worldwide in several important industry sectors after a one time review by the Commerce Department. The regulations implement the policy changes announced by Vice President Gore in "Through the hard work of industry and government officials to finalize this regulation, U.S. encryption firms will be better able to compete effectively with encryption manufacturers around the world," said William A. Reinsch, Commerce Under Secretary for Export Administration. Virtually eliminated are restrictions on selling powerful computer data scrambling products to subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. There will also be favorable licensing treatment to strategic partners of U.S. companies. Strong U.S.-made encryption products are now available, under license exception, to insurance companies headquartered in 46 countries and their branches worldwide. Sales of powerful encryption to health and medical organizations in the same countries are also eased. To facilitate secure electronic transactions, between on-line merchants in those same countries, and their customers, the updated regulations permit, under a license exception, the export of client-server applications (e.g. SSL) and applications tailored to on-line transactions to on-line merchants. A list of eligible countries is posted on the BXA web-site. Further easing government restrictions are new allowances for U.S. encryption manufacturers to share their source code with their own foreign subsidiaries (while requiring that any resulting new products remain subject to U.S. regulation ) and streamlining reporting requirements for U.S. firms so that compliance is less burdensome.
The new regulations expand the policy of encouraging the use of recoverable encryption by removing the requirement to name and approve key recovery agents for exports of key recovery products from regulations. It also defines a new class of "recoverable" encryption products which can now be exported under Export Licensing Arrangements to foreign commercial firms for internal company proprietary use. As part of its stated goal to balance the needs of national security and public safety with the desire to protect personal privacy and strong electronic commercial security, the Administration continues to encourage the development and sale of products which enable the recovery of the unscrambled data, in an emergency situation.
Finally, the regulations eliminate the need to obtain licenses for most encryption commodities and software up to 56-bits or equivalent strength.
