Good call :-)
It is a good plan indeed. Looking at the OS-market, one can speak of a monopoly of Microsoft.
We know, what monopolies lead to. In terms of security, this is a frightening thought. We all
have seen security breaches by the software, be it Windows itself or the Internet explorer.
AND we know how long it takes Microsoft to adapt to new standards. I'm quite confident that the guys at MS still think, that a 56-bit DES key is impossible to break ;-)
I think, this matter deserves further investigation.
