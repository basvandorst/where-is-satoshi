@_subject: Keyboard & Mouse Recorder 
Does anyone know where I can get a keyboard recorder for WIN95 and OS/2
I would like to record the mouse and keyboard strokes.  Then re-run the host program at a pre-determined time.

@_subject: Keyboard emulation 
Looking for a design of a keyboard & mouse emulator.  What I would like to do is control a main computer's keyboard and mouse functions by a second RS232 remote IBM PC.  Has anybody tried this?  Do you foresee any problems?

What is the frequency on the back of your pager?  Some people would like to monitor this type of information.

My pager delivers me selected miniaturized Reuters news stories.
I just got one that reads:
   REDWOOD CITY, CA - Netscape Communications Corp. and Verifone
   Inc. will devise a system to make electronic payments on the internet
   more secure.
Anyone know anything about this? I'm away from my normal sources of
such things (like Bloomberg terminals)...
