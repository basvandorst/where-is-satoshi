As a response to this example.  I'd argue Mallet has less of a
reputation because:
        (1) if this example applies to the first 10 questions from each
person, Alice will answer many more questions that Mallet.  (Mallet answers
10 and is done.)
        (2) if this example means the first 10 questions from anywhere
Mallet than has to arrange to have his customer's 10 questions in the queue
and ready to go before any other person can get in the queue, which is some
        In general, I'd think reputation is akin to brand name to a degree.
Differentiation!  So, if Alice notices people tracking her "reputation
advertising" she can change it.  Reputation might not be as static a concept
as we think (as others have mentioned by bringing up arbitrage.)

Rather liked this quote regarding the development of the super in the 1950s.
J. Robert Oppenheimer, "Atomic Weapons and American Policy," Foreign
Affairs, Vol. 31, No. 4, July 1953, p. 525.
 [We must have] candor on the part of the officials of the United States
Government to the officials, the representatives, the people of their
country.  We do not operate well when the important facts, the essential
conditions, which limit and determine our choices are unknown.  We do not
operate well when they are known, in secrecy and in fear, only to a few men.
        The political vitality of our country largely derives form two
sources.  One is the interplay, the conflict of opinion and debate, in may
diverse and complex agencies, legislative and executive, which contribute to
the making of policy.  The other is a public opinion which is based on
confidence that it knows the truth.
        Today public opinion cannot exist in this field.  No responsible
person will hazard and opinion in a field where he believes that there is
somebody else who knows the true, and where he believes that he does not
know it.

@_subject: Re: Theory Question: Why isn't RSA a 0-knowledge Proof 
Seems right enough.
        Still pondering though... [1]  If I (the signer) choose the series of messages to sign, this still
demonstrates that I have a secret without telling you the secret (and
without giving you the information you might have been fishing for..)  You
do get information you would not have been able to create
otherwise,(whatever it is I choose to sign) ...but it doesn't matter if you
wanted the information or not, what matters is that you got it???  You could
get random information (entropy) as part of a protocol, would this destroy
the 0-knowledge aspect as well (and make it merely a min-disclosure
proof...?))  (if you aren't directly challanging me, there could be a replay
or man in the middle attack or whatnot, but the man in the middle attack
also applies to 0KP.)
        What I was thinking of, was a hamiltonian cycle example:
[2]where the person that wants to see the proof is getting information
regarding the iso-morphism between the various graphs... (For instance, say
G is the real graph, Alice knows the path, and Bob wants proof that Alice
knows it...)  So in the first instance Alice produces H1 and shows it to Bob
and proves it is iso-morphic, in the second example she produces H2 and
shows the cycle, in the third instance, she provides H3 and it's isomorphism
to G... Bob can then conclude that H1 and H2 are isomorphic... I'm not sure
about this (this must be where I am in error) but I don't think Bob could
have derived the fact easily (if it is plausible for him to believe H1~=H2
based on this protocol) that H1 and H2 are isomorphic without Alice's help
here... So in this case, Bob picked up some info he would have not otherwise
known for free (similar to the first example) even though this information
isn't of any use to him with regard to the solution to G.

     Linking your Web site to anyone else's without permission? Be glad
     you're not in Georgia--or be worried if you are.
     Gov. Zell Miller on the morning of April 18 signed into a law a
     piece of imbecility that the Marietta Daily Journal had dubbed the
     Internet Police bill.
     House Bill 1630 may prevent Webfolk from linking from their
     homepages against the wishes of the linkees--at least if the other
     guys' names or logos are used.
     Is 1630 a belated April Fool's joke? I've heard of Net-dumb pols,
     but Georgia has out-Exoned Exon--and maybe even out-Doled Dole.
     Shari Steele, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
     wrote Gov. Miller before the signing: "The language of the bill
     would make it illegal to create a button on our web site with
     Wired's 'trade name' or 'logo' without first obtaining 'permission
     or authorization' from Wired magazine." Whoops: oh, please,
     Wired--don't sue me. Actually that would be the state's job; you
     see, the law would let Georgia throw your posterior in jail for up
     to a year.
     Live out of state? As of this writing it was unclear how much of a
     danger extradition would pose--maybe none, given the lunacy of the
     law. Then again, there are rumors that California and other states
     may replicate Georgia's stupidity.
     The morning the Guv signed the bill, I dropped by the State of
     Georgia Home Page. Under "Search Engines and other Web Services" I
     saw a link to Yahoo. I'm glad the Georgia folks can use Yahoo from
     down there, rather than having to start their own. Imagine Yahoo
     needing permission for every link with a trademarked name. And what
     about a page displaying the results of a Lycos search? Now that
     would be fun. Can you imagine the Lycos computer e-mailing every
     site brought up--asking permission--before it listed Web addresses?
     I visited Zell Miller's Web area. Without the least irony, a
     headline read: "Governor Miller's Technology Initiatives Thrive."
     The page bragged about computers in classrooms. Just don't let the
     little brats grow up to start Yahoo Kudzu.
     According to the EFF, the same law might make it illegal even to
     mention a company's name on the Web without permission. True? Just
     imagine what this could mean to an online newspaper reviewing
     another publication's Web site. Already a software company outside
     Georgia has used existing intellectual property law to bully a
     reviewer. I've said it once, and I'll say it again: The media are
     damned fools if they support intellectual property zealotry of the
     kind we've seen out of Capitol Hill recently. Goodbye, First
     Amendment. These are national issues, alas, not just problems with
     the Georgia drinking water.
     If nothing else, I suspect that the good folks at the AT&T
     Business Network--the ones who run LeadStory.com, a collection of
     the day's hottest stories from online newspapers--may have some
     thoughts on the Georgia bill. To add to the fun, when I dropped by
     Cox Newspapers' big Web site for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, I
     saw a "Surf Less. Know More" ad from LeadStory.com.
     At the Atlanta site's Net News I just happened to read a report on
     a trademark infringement suit that BellSouth had filed against the
     an Internet directory called the Real InterNet Pages. Hmmm. Any
     connections here with the new law? And simply because BellSouth's
     print directories use the trademarked phrase "The Real Yellow
     Pages," is the company entitled to  smaller
     company's existing Web address? The Real InterNet Pages, after
     all, isn't saying, " In any event one would
     hardly confuse the Real InterNet Pages with BellSouth; the pigmy
     tells visitors to its home page: "Not Affiliated, Associated or
     Connected with BellSouth or any BellSouth-related company."
     Coincidentally or not, the Internet Police bill was introduced by
     Don Parsons, a Net-innocent employee of BellSouth. According to the
     Conservative Policy Caucus in the Georgia House: "During floor
     debate, Rep. Parsons could not explain the concept of a link on a
     home page. It was clear to many that he had no idea of what the
     Internet was all about. Supposedly, his desire was to prevent
     'misrepresentation' on the Internet. Parsons admitted that he had
     never been on the Internet, except looking over a colleague's
     shoulder at work." One can understand, then, why many Netfolks
     wonder if Parsons' employer has encouraged him to squelch
     competition at a time when the Baby Bells envision a Web full of
     Yellow Pages. Bell South vehemently denies a connection between it
     and the Parsons bill. Whatever the case, however, the legislation
     would help the Parsons' employer.
     Oh, I've read Parsons' stated reasons for his law. But in guarding
     against fraud and protecting intellectual property rights, do we
     really want to toss out the First Amendment? Jeff Kuester, a Net-hip
     attorney of intellectual property in Atlanta, says: "We should
     certainly strive for effective protection of intellectual property
     on the Web, but not by destroying this crucial part of the
     information superhighway. These links let people move seamlessly
     from Web site to Web site. They're as crucial to the Web as bridges
     are to our nation's system of concrete-and-asphalt roads. If nothing
     else, we should avoid denying Netizens the free speech guaranteed
     outside cyberspace." While Parsons has denied that his law would
     make unauthorized links illegal, its wording would suggest
     otherwise.
     Criticizing Parsons' work, the Conservative Policy Caucus quotes
     the essence of HB1630 as it could affect links, and I'll pass on a
     rough extract with some tweaks of my own for the sake of clarity and
     precision: "It shall be unlawful for any person...knowingly to
     transmit any data through a computer network...if such data uses any
     individual name, trade name, registered trademark, logo, legal or
     official seal or copyrighted symbol to falsely state or imply that
     such person...has permission or is legally authorized to use such
     trade name, registered trademark..."
     Granted, some might say that you could assume implied consent if
     any material is up on an open medium like the Web and you want to
     link to it with appropriate identification by name. But the law is
     still a big threat, given the new legal liabilities it creates for
     journalists, publishers, activists and many others. Suppose your
     story online won't read like a puff piece. Will you need your
     target's goodwill before you can link to the site of a polluter or
     other recipient of negative publicity? And what about linking
     privately? Suppose you're on a local area network in the newsroom
     and want to share information with colleagues by way of an internal
     Web page. Will you require at least your target's tacit consent
     before you can do so? Exactly what does HB1630 mean by "a computer
     network," just the external variety? Not in my extract above was
     this additional language: "for the purpose of setting up,
     maintaining, operating, or exchanging data with an electronic
     mailbox, home page, or any other electronic information storage bank
     or point of access to electronic information." Sounds as if the
     Internet Police law won't delight the Society for Professional
     Journalists, Investigative Reporters and Editors or the Reporter's
     Committee for Freedom of the Press.
     Bill 1630 also contains other goodies, according to the valuable
     April 17 issue of EFFector Online and the EFF's Steele. For example,
     Ms. Steele says the bill could criminalize the use of pseudonyms;
     I'd suspect that's of interest to, say, American Online or to
     safety-minded parents who want their children to log on with fake
     names. Besides, just what's a "false" name? Ms. Steele writes of
     someone with the user name of "elvis" and says: "Even my own user
     ID, which is ssteele, does not clearly distinguish me from others
     with the last name of Steele and the first initial 'S.'"
     I myself am another good example of the identity issues that
     arise on a global computer network. My publisher insisted on calling
     my book NetWorld!, and it was logical for me to set up a NetWorld!
     Web site but guess what? If you do an Alta Vista search, you'll also
     find thousands of "NetWorld" mentions from unrelated "NetWorld"
     sites and the rest of the Web. Among the others are Peter's Networld
     from Peter Heneback, a Swedish foreign exchange student at West
     Anchorage High School in Alaska; NETWorld Market Place; NetWorld
     Publishing; NetWorld Systems; Networld +Interop, which, yes, has
     been known to hold expos down in Atlanta; and NetWorld Limited, a
     Hong Kong consulting company.
     And I'm to worry about other "NetWorlds" and "Networlds" from
     Alaska to Atlanta and Asia?
     While trademark law has its place, we need to allow for reasonable
     interpretations. I asked Prima Publishing to consult an attorney
     before it used NetWorld! on pulped wood. No problem, I heard. But
     what happens to my book's online version if I'm in Georgia and
     trademark fanatics prevail in court?
     There and elsewhere, politicians keep babbling that they'll get
     government off our backs. What bilge. If Georgia politicans respect
     citizens' rights, why is the high-tech community talking of a
     lawsuit against the Internet Police law? Alas, the Georgia state
     legislature won't meet again until next year, but meanwhile Zell
     Miller might speak out against his baby before it frightens away
     millions of dollars of high-tech business. Perhaps he can at least
     promise to ask his attorney general not to enforce the Internet
     Police law. As long as the law is still alive, I myself will do
     everything I can to warn Netfolks that Georgia is a risky place for
     them to do business right now.
     Meanwhile, I suspect that the Internet Police law will be like Jim
     Exon's Communications Decency Act. Many people will just ignore it,
     furthering breaking down the respect of Generation Net for
     politicians and bureaucrats in general.

HOW TO PROTEST THE SILLINESS
       _______________________________________________________________
     The Internet Police bill--effective July 1, 1996--passed at least
     partly because politicians kowtowed to Big Bucks. Tell them they
     were wrong, that the bill will cost Georgia, that it's about as
     good for the state as Sherman's March was, that you'll tell your
     high-tech employer to stay the hell out of Georgia to avoid
     net.stupid regulations, that you'll think twice about attending the
     Olympics or buying goods that carry the Olympic logo.
     Let Georgia pols know that most Web sites thrive because of the
     ease of linking, not in spite of it. Time Magazine has zillions of
     links all over the Net. And without bureaucratic intervention,
     Netfolks already enjoy a wealth of phone- and Net-directories such
     as Yahoo's.
     Tell the Georgians that the Internet Police bill is a creature of
     special interests such as phone companies and, yes, politicians
     trying to crimp uppity rivals, including those in the Conservative
     Caucus. Some establishmentarians hated the idea of the
     conservatives' using the official Georgia seal on their Web site.
     This issue transcends ideology--my own politics are progressive.

     this case could be a natural for a group such as the American Civil
     Liberties Union or the Interactive Services Assocation, whose
     members include American Online, CompuServe and Prodigy, among
     others. One legislator has talked of corrective legislation, but
     according to Kaye's current thinking, a court challenge at this
     point would be more effective, since other politicians could water
     down a bill. At any rate, a bill couldn't be formally introduced
     until January 1996; and, says, Kaye, a court case could be the best
     approach. Stay tuned. Foes of the law are still sorting out their
     options as far as the best way to proceed.

     Parsons, sponsor of House Bill 1630, works for BellSouth; but the

     exemption from liability for telephone companies and Internet access

     BellSouth did say that "it is probably probably overkill and unduly
     complicating to make the act of trademark infringement,
     misrepresentation and passing off on the Internet a crime under
     state law." The company also offered observations on the law's

@_subject: FBI probes CompuServe adult programming 
COLUMBUS, Ohio, May 8 (UPI) -- The FBI, acting on a complaint from a  Christian morals watchdog group, Wednesday sought to determine whether CompuServe Inc. has violated a new law against indecency.         FBI agents said they were attempting to determine whether  CompuServe's Entertainment Drive, which contains some adult material, violates the Communications Decency Act. The law prohibits offering pornography to on-line users, especially minors.         CompuServe, headquartered in Upper Arlington, noted parents can now  block their children from reaching any adult-oriented content. Users must use a password to reach certain restricted areas.         ``At this time we are not doing anything,'' CompuServe spokeswoman  Daphne Kent told the Columbus Dispatch. ``We cooperate fully with any law enforcement agency, but we have not had talks with (the FBI) at this time.''         The FBI started the investigation after the Justice Department  determined a complaint from the American Family Association had merit.         A spokesman said American Family made CompuServe a target because the  on-line service is one of the world's largest such businesses and offers sexually oriented content.         American Family, based in Tupelo, Miss., also objects to CompuServe's  MacGlamour Forum, which contains adult pictures and movies.

@_subject: SEC lets California retailer trade stock on Internet 
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuter) - A California company that  sells energy-saving solar panels has received Securities and Exchange Commission approval to trade its stock over the Internet, extending the boundaries of off-exchange trading into cyberspace.          The approval, the first the SEC has issued on stock  trading over the Internet, was given earlier this week to Ukiah, Calif.-based Real Goods Trading Corp., through a ``no action'' letter.          In such a letter, the SEC allows a petitioning company to  perform what it requested to do, without fear of any enforcement action. In approving Real Goods' request, however, the agency imposed conditions in the interest of investor protection.          John Schaeffer, president, chief executive and founder of  the company said in an interview he hoped to get the new system operational ``within a couple of weeks.''          Schaeffer said that since 1991, his company has sold $4.6  million of its company's stock to the public through direct, small offerings and without having to pay fees to investment bankers.          ``The 'off the grid' trading of our stock is a logical  extension of our service to our customers, who will now be able to buy and sell our security without going through a broker,'' Schaeffer said.          ``This is also consistent with our mission of creating  independent energy alternatives for our customers,'' he added.          Real Goods is currently traded thinly on the Pacific Stock  Exchange, at a price range of between $5 to $7 in 1995. The stock closed at $7.25 on June 26.          In its application, the company said its system would  function as a passive Internet bulletin board that will provide the names, addresses, including E-mail, and phone numbers of interested buyers and sellers and number of shares offered for sale or desired to be purchased.          Those participating may transmit the information through  the company's World Wide Web site or by telephone, fax, mail or E-mail. Real Goods will then enter the data into the system.          Real Goods posted a loss of $175,000 last year on sales of  $15.3 million, Schaeffer said.          ``We expect to be profitable this year,'' he said, adding he  estimates sales to climb to about $20 million.          Earlier this year, the SEC permitted Spring Street Brewery  Co., of New York, to make an initial public offering over the Internet. The agency asked the company to suspend trading, pending review of legal implications of such a trading system.          Spring Street subsequently said it planned to establish an  online stock exchange through a unit.

HAMBURG, GERMANY, 1996 JUL 23 (NB) -- By Sylvia Dennis. FTP Software,  the Internet/connectivity software company, has licensed Pretty Good Privacy's encryption technology of the same name (PGP). Plans now call for FTP to integrate PGP within its range of TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) software. Under the terms of the agreement, PGP has licensed its encryption  software to FTP for use in OnNet32 2.0 for Windows 95 and Windows NT, both versions of which will ship in the third quarter of this year on both sides of the Atlantic. Tom Steding, PGP's chief executive officer, said that a critical piece  of the company's business strategy is to proliferate the "seamless integration of encryption technology" within e-mail applications programs. "We see this partnership as a powerful combination of two leaders who,  together, will use their considerable market weight and technical expertise to promote and enhance the PGP towards becoming a universally accepted industry standard," he said. According to Rebecca Buisan, product marketing manager with FTP, the  company has made several enhancements to OnNet32 to integrate PGP into its basic functions. There is now a two icon system which allows users to access a tool bar, designating options to encrypt or decrypt a message, and make a digital signature. Mail messages can also be left on a server or computer in an encrypted format, to be decrypted and read at will. "Experience has proven that cryptography only works if implemented  effectively, so that it is simple for the user," she explained. According to Buisan, FTP has conducted extensive human factors testing  to fine-tune PGP's cryptographic software into a "flexible and intuitive application that people will be encouraged to use." According to FTP, its implementation of the PGP encryption software  is interoperable with current freeware versions available for free download from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) or one of the many other FTP (File Transfer Protocol) sites that distribute the package. The MIT site is at  . PGP was originally developed in 1991 by Phil Zimmerman. The package  allowed PC users, for the first time, to send information in a secure encrypted format without fear of intervention. FTP's Web site is at  .

@_subject: MasterCard & GTE In Electronic Certification Deal 07/25/96 
What I spoke of yesterday:
PURCHASE, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1996 JUL 25 (NB) -- REPEAT/By  Ian Stokell. The race is on to provide extensive, secure electronic commerce over the Internet. Now MasterCard International and GTE Corp. (NYSE:GTE) have announced plans to deliver electronic certification services under the new Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) standard. The certificate authority services will be appearing by the fourth  quarter, and will be implemented in a number of pilot programs worldwide, say the two companies. Newsbytes notes that a major obstacle to electronic commerce on  the Internet is not the lack of suitable technologies, but public distrust in having to send credit card numbers electronically, with the perception that they can be easily intercepted en route. Industry experts say the public needs some sort of proven online security methods backed by financial and online heavyweights such as MasterCard. A sort of digital certificate will be developed by the two companies  that will protect both the consumer and vendor against unauthorized card number use. The digital certificates will reportedly be issued via the Internet to cardholding consumers, Internet merchants, and institutions processing the transactions. While a number of methods for secure transactions are beginning to  appear in the online world, notes Newsbytes, none have instantly jumped out in front of the pack. The companies say that the SET standard appeared first in June, and  that software to allow it to be incorporated into Internet browsers, servers, and gateways will be available by the early fourth quarter from several vendors. The standard was developed by MasterCard and Visa in cooperation with a number of other companies, including GTE, IBM, Microsoft, and Netscape. Said Steve Mott, senior vice president, Electronic Commerce/New  Ventures at MasterCard. "Obtaining digital signatures is expected to be no more difficult than signing up for an online service. We are also pushing to extend SET certification to chip cards to get added hardware/platform security and portability. We expect to extend our activities with GTE along these and other lines, so they are a key strategic ally for MasterCard and our members." Mott added: "We will begin testing the software by the end of the  summer and through the remainder of this year. The missing link (to online commerce) was providing digital certificates to add the extra software authentication needed to make SET complete." A number of electronic commerce pilots are being planned for the fourth  quarter. Pilots that have already been announced in which MasterCard is participating are in Denmark (with PBS, IBM, and Europay) and Malaysia (with MBf and VeriFone). GTE plans to offer both certification authority products and services  under the CyberTrust brand name. CyberTrust will reportedly support all popular Web browsers, servers, and other public key-enabled applications, such as secure e-mail and electronic data interchange.

@_subject: ****Developer Recants Hostile Java Applet Story 08/06/96 
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1996 AUG 6 (NB) --  By Patrick McKenna. Finjan Software of Israel, which earlier said its Java security software detected what the company called a publicly available hostile Java applet at a game site on the World Wide Web, has issued a statement changing its earlier claims. In the first story on the Java applet labeled "hostile" by Finjan,  Newsbytes reported early Tuesday that the Java applet in question is part of a game available on the Web and connected to America Online. Shmulik Suhami, spokesperson for Finjan, told Newsbytes at the time, "We were contacted by one of our users who detected a hostile Java applet and we have confirmed the user's experience." Newsbytes reported Sun Microsystems' JavaSoft division reply as saying,  "This issue is totally and completely bogus. Security features built into Java do not allow an applet to read or write to another computer without issuing a warning message and this applet in question is not a hostile Java applet. An individual at AT&T, acting independently of the company, developed the applet. We suspect a file for the applet was placed on a second system and that is probably why Finjan's software incorrectly read it as a hostile application. Actually, this is a flaw in Finjan's software. There is no bug or hostile application at all." In its early story, Newsbytes also quoted a JavaSoft spokesperson  as saying, "What is going on is that the person's applet called an audio file from a second machine and Java's security features are so strong and restrictive that an exception is raised whenever a second machine is called. Finjan's software appears to have read the call to the second machine as a hostile bug." In recanting its initial claims, Finjan released the following  statement: "We want to issue a clarification on the media alert we sent out yesterday describing a potentially suspicious Java applet.

WELLESLEY, MASSACHUSETTS, U.S.A., 1996 AUG 7 (NB) -- By Bob Woods.  A person's face may become much more valuable than providing good looks to everyone who sees him or her. That's because Miros Inc. has developed a new software product that uses face recognition to access secured areas on a network. Miros' "TrueFace CyberWatch" is described as the first product of its  kind that controls access to secured data by using facial lines. The technology is based on neural networks technology invented by Miros President Michael Kuperstein and the company's Dr. James Kottas, and developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Variability of people's faces is overcome in determining whether an  actual face is the same or different than a face image that was previously stored. TrueFace CyberWatch uses Miros' software and a small video camera on  top of the computer monitor to verify computer users when they try to access protected data. TrueFace "snaps" a picture of the current computer operator and compares it to images in a database of authorized users. Continued spot checks are taken to ensure the same user is at the computer. Some of the information that can be protected includes medical,  financial, criminal, or military records, officials said. The system requires no training, is fast to use, and cannot be fooled by holding up a photo of a person. This technology has been used in other situations, including the  securing of buildings or special areas, officials said. TrueFace CyberWatch is compatible with PC client/server standards and  can be used alone or with other security programs, officials said. The client runs on Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems, and  costs $199. A bundle package, which includes a Connectix camera and the software, is priced at $298. Both products will be shipping within the next two months, officials said. (19960807/Press Contact: Christine Sheroff, Sheroff & Associates,  508-435-3306)

@_subject: Electronic Cash System Based On The Representation 
Interesting paper I had not heard of, but was recently referred to...
Electronic Cash System Based On The Representation Problem Stefan Brands CWI P.O. Box 4079, 1009 AB Amsterdam The Netherlands e-mail: brands Abstract: We present a new on-line electronic cash system based on a
problem, called the representation problem, of which little use has been
made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on
discrete logarithms. Using the representation problem as a basic concept,
some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for
withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of
earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in
both computation and communication complexity than previously proposed
systems. Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability .
Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be
mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically , if we make one
plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break
the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem. Our
system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously
known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the
entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated
straight forwardly in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has
the important advantage that double- spending can be prevented in the
\014rst place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after
the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most
stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which
seems to b e impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another
benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible
probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple
mechanism from within the system, which is something that p previous
solutions lack entirely . Furthermore, the basic cash system can be extended
to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility , while retaining its
computational efficiency. Although in this paper we only make use of the
representation problem in groups of prime order, similar intractable
problems hold in RSA-groups (with computational equivalence to facto ring
and computing RSA- roots). We discuss how one can use these problems to
construct an efficient cash system with security related to factoring or
computation of RSA-roots, in an analogous way to the discrete log based
system. Finally , we discuss a decision problem (the decision variant of the
Diffie-Hellman problem) that is strongly related to undeniable signatures,
which to our knowledge has never been stated in literature and of which we
do not know whether it is in BPP. A p roof of its status would be of
interest to discrete log based cryptography in general. Using the
representation problem, we show in the appendix how to batch the
confirmation protocol of undeniable signatures such that polynomially many
undeniable signatures can be verified in four moves.

@_subject: Boeing Antenna Demos T1 Reception Rates 
WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A., 1996 AUG 27 (NB) -- By Bill Pietrucha. All  eyes were on the truck as it meandered its way down the twisting mountain road in northern Bosnia. Except the eyes didn't belong to lookouts in an observation post along the road. They were in a modified US Air Force (USAF) C-135 flying at 35,000 feet along the East Coast of the United States, some 6,000 miles away. The USAF C-135, known by the name Speckled Trout, was participating  in the 1996 Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (JWID `96). JWID `96 is the eighth in a series of technology demonstrations  designed to identify command, control, communications, computer, and intelligence (C4I) problems between the armed services, demonstrate improved operational capabilities for deployed forces, and promote interoperability among existing and emerging C4I systems needed to support a joint task force. As part of the exercise, the Air Force installed the first full-scale  prototype Ku-band phased array receive antenna system on the Speckled Trout, a modified avionics testbed aircraft maintained by the 412th Flight Test Squadron at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The antenna, developed by Boeing Co., is capable of receiving broad-  band, high data rate satellite communications, with civilian as well as military applications, Boeing spokesperson Charles Ramey told Newsbytes. According to Ramey, the antenna will "revolutionize mobile satellite  communications by increasing the data flow by thousands of times over current capabilities." Depending on the satellite and receiver, he said, rates of up to 30  megabits-per-second (Mbps) may be realized through a single transponder. "To date, satellite communication to mobile platforms has been limited  to relatively narrow bandwidths, and wide band communication has been subject to the limits of antenna technology," Ramey told Newsbytes. The Boeing design can be adapted to simultaneously receive signals  from multiple satellites in different orbits with a single antenna. The electronically steered antenna also allows for rapid switching between different satellites. During the JWID exercises, which will continue through August 30,  the Boeing antenna system is being used to receive satellite transmitted video and data to support the Global Broadcast Service (GBS) mission. GBS, Ramey said, is designed to provide the military with a worldwide, seamless, high-throughput broadcast information service to support current and future defense objectives. As one Air Force Colonel at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa,  Florida, told Newsbytes, "GBS is the CNN of the warfighter." EchoStar, a key member of the antenna demonstration team,  transmitted video in Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) format for reception by the Boeing antenna system on the Speckled Trout. In addition to the video, an uplink data stream at T1, or 1.5Mbps,  or higher is generated at the GBS uplink terminal testbed at the Operational Support Office facility located at the Naval research Facility near Washington DC. This signal, according to Ramey, is relayed through the GBS  Americom K2 FSS satellite which downlinks to a receiver at an EchoStar facility. The data is then incorporated into the network broadcast system and retransmitted via the EchoStar 1 satellite to a GBS receiver. The data is then stored for retrieval by other systems, Ramey said,  including the Global Command and Control System (GCCS), sponsored by the Air Force Communications Agency, and the Combat Information System, sponsored by the Air Intelligence Agency. "Other systems on board the Speckled Trout can retrieve data through  the Boeing phased array antenna system, which is routed to terminals inside the aircraft for display and demonstration," Ramey said. The Speckled Trout also can track and receive video and data from  EchoStar Dish Network TV, Hughes DirectTV, and USSB transmissions for display on a conventional monitor, Ramey said. Looking to commercial applications, Ramey said the phased array  communication antenna system "offers the ability to provide passengers with more entertainment and information options. With the Boeing antenna system on board, passengers can have access to the entire spectrum of commercial television programming available from a BSS satellite." Ramey said the antenna system is capable of instantaneously  bringing in approximately 100 channels from a given BSS satellite.

Systematic research o n online financial services is virtually non-existent.
Most of the early work consists of anecdotal evidence from individual

empirical basis. Clearly there is a need for industry-acade mia
collaboration to understand the online financial services area better. There
is also a need to develop methods and tools for measuring the effectiveness
of these services. Traditional effectiveness measuring methods will be of

The bank will be using a system currently under development by Hitachi Ltd. and Bank of America subsidiary Concorde Solutions, a Hitachi spokeswoman confirmed to Newsbytes today. "The new system will enable credit card transactions via the  Internet," said Hitachi's Emi Takase. "Bank of America is aiming to market the system from August, 1997." Customers should be able to check credit card balances and account  details, apply for credit limit increases, and many of the other actions that a telephone is currently used for. Concorde Solutions, a company 70 percent owned by Bank of America,  will develop the application for users with Hitachi. It will run on top of the Japanese company's TP Broker system, an object request broker that was developed with Visigenic Software Inc. Launch customer for the system will be Concorde parent Bank of  America, but plans are for the system to be marketed to other banks. "The product will be sold by both companies afterwards," said Takase.

moreso than others. I thought the following was a useful breakdown for my
own purposes:
Caveat on Vocabulary
Before proceeding with the analysis we must first discuss some of the terms
used in the analysis. The usage of terms "objective" and "judgmental" can
be rather contentious. To address this, we disassociate any of these terms
with any pejorative meanings ( opinionated gut feelings about Web content
can be very useful ) and posit  that there are three variables with which
content labeling systems can be considered: descriptive/judgmental - does the label describe the content, or provide an
opinion about the "appropriateness" of the content.
deterministic/non-deterministic - is the previous process a deterministic
process, or is it "gut" based, and voluntary, mandatory, or third party - does the author label his works
voluntarily, is he required to label his works by some other agency, or can
other services label his content.
No rating system we discuss is purely descriptive or deterministic. Rather,
each system varies with respect to where it falls between extremes.
