 m> I send an encrypted message via fidonet! (awk!)
 m>   m>      I had heard a rumor that fidonet forbade encrypted e-mail,  m> but I had to find out for myself.  Well, they do.  Now I  m> understand that these sysops are spending their own money and  m> equipment to provide these services and have the right to  m> regulate it in any way they see fit.  That's not the point. This is _NOT_ true.  There is no prohibition on encrypted messages
within FidoNet.  There is a large number of people within FidoNet that
use wishful thinking to support such a ban.
FidoNet policy states only that routing of encrypted traffic through
a system that has not previously authorized such traffic is considered
annoying behavior.  Contrary to what many would have you believe,
that is the _ONLY_ rule about encrypted traffic in FidoNet.
 m> The point(s) is/are:
 m>   m> 1)   They ACTIVELY enforce this policy.  They don't simply say  m> "no," they check (presumably) all of their user's email to  m> enforce this policy.
There is a great deal of paranoia within FidoNet about encryption.
There are many who will not allow encrypted traffic on their systems.
Of course, most of these have never heard of the term, steganography.
I have a simple message that I like to send to these folks.  Even
though the hidden message is just reading down the first column,
many people, especially those who claim they don't allow encrypted
messages on their system, miss it.
When PGP 2.0 first came out, I ran into these paranoids who said "There
will never be any encryption on my system".  I decided that an end run
around these bozos was in order, so I created the SecureMail system.
SecureMail is a group of FidoNet sysops who have agreed to route any
and all mail through their systems without any form of censorshiop
or monitoring.  It now covers every part of the U.S., with some overseas
I can post a list of those participating if you would like.
Encrypted traffic now flows regularly through the SecureMail system.
 m> 2)   They seem to be afraid to pass/store encrypted messages on  m> their system.  This indicates to me a lack of understanding of  m> the concept of privacy.  They seem to buy into the idea that  m> "only BAD people encrypt email."
I fully agree with this assesment.  They do not understand that they
cannot be responsible for a message that they cannot read.  I
continually run into the "What have I got to hide attitude".  There
are a number of us in FidoNet actively promoting privacy and the use
of PGP.  We are making slow and painful progress.

I can probably guess the names that you deleted.  I get this type
of message frequently.  It's sad, but true that these people do need
educating.  Unfortunately, there are many with the closed minds so
well demonstrated in the message that you posted.
The primary internet/FidoNet gateway system (zeus.ieee.org) has
agreed to pass encrypted traffic from FidoNet to the internet and
vice versa.  However, much of the internet/FidoNet traffic passes
through other gateway systems which do not necessarily allow
encrypted traffic.  Even traffic that passes through zeus.ieee.org
may be routed through FidoNet systems that don't allow encrypted
The trick in passing encrypted traffic between the internet and
FidoNet is in making sure that the routing sends it through a
gateway system that allows encrypted traffic and provides a direct
link into the SecureMail system.
You can send mail to any FidoNet system by addressing the message
to me at:
      Jim.Cannell
Put a line at the beginning of the text identifying the ultimate
addressee and his FidoNet address.  Right now, I will have to
manually process all such messages, but maybe if I get enough
traffic, it will motivate me to write a remailer program.  Then
we can can have anonymous remailing within FidoNet as well.  That
really ought to set the paranoids off :-).
There are others that will probably provide this service as well.
I'll post their names as they give permission.
By the time I received this message (I only get updates to this list
three times a week), the discussion has been extensive.  I have neither
the time nor the desire to respond to everything on the thread.  Rest
assured that I have read it.  Since it has stirred up so much controversy,
I will introduce the topic in the approritate places in FidoNet.  It
needs exposure there.  Since FidoNet systems are for the most part
privately owned, it is there especially that privacy needs to be
encouraged. PGP key 1024/72C6A7

FidoNet policy has a statement allowing monitoring of all intransit
mail.  I guess I'm going to have to dig my copy of Policy out of the
archives to post the relevant paragraphs.
This is a very shortsighted policy.
Although financial restraints have curtailed my operations here making
a lot of this moot, my own policy allows all users and passthru mail to be
encrypted.  I neither monitor nor censor.

@_subject: FidoNet Remailer 
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
I have been a long time lurker on this list, as well as having a long time
interest in crypto.  Most of my activity in this area has been on FidoNet
rather than the internet.  Due to the control phreak nature of much of
FidoNet, I've spent a lot of time and effort in an attempt to just simply
route around the bastards.  I created the SecureMail system, which is a
network of FidoNet nodes that agree to route any and all traffic without
monitoring or censorship.  Within SecureMail, encrypted traffic is not
only permitted, it is encouraged.
Which brings me to the point of this message.  I have written a anonymous
remailer program for FidoNet.  It is currently running on my FidoNet node
in an alpha test mode.  It has only been running a couple of weeks, and
seems to be doing quite well.  I have just added internet addressability
to it.  What this means is that now anonymous messages can be remailed
between FidoNet and the internet.  Having still another routing path should
further decrease the traceability of these messages.
I would like to ask the cypherpunks to help me test the remailer across
the gateway.  Please send many messages through this remailer from both
the FidoNet and the internet side of the gateway.  Try to break it.  I
want a good reliable piece of software, and if it can survive attempts
by this group to break it, there will be a lot more confidence in it.
Following are instructions for using the FidoNet remailer:
- From FidoNet, send your message to Remail at 1:216/21.  From the internet,
send your message to: remail
In all cases, the first text line of the message must contain a double
colon.  The second line contains the remail command, and the third line
is blank.  The actual text to be remailes starts on line 4.
To send a message to Joe Sixpack at FidoNet address 1:102/903, enter:
remail-to: Joe Sixpack @ 1:102/903.
To send a message to an internet address, enter:
remail-to: tcmay
(Sorry, Tim -- couldn't resist using you as an example :-) To get a short help file, enter:
To post a message to the FidoNet SYSOP Echo, enter:
remail-to: SYSOP
I'll welcome discussions of this remailer on the list, or in private mail.
Bug reports and/or comments are encouraged.  I can be reached at
BTW, I will be at the cypherpunks meeting in Anguilla next week.  Hope to
meet some of you there.

Thanks to all of you who have responded to my announcement of the FidoNet
remailer.  I appreciate the good words.  So far, the remailer has handled
everything that you have thrown at it.  One remailed message bounced back
to me because the FidoNet/internet gateway system could not find the
addressed system.  That one looks like a gateway problem.
Please keep sending messages through it.  Send grunged messages, improperly
addressed messages -- anything you can think of to make it barf.  I want it
to be able to withstand the vicious attacks that I'm sure will come once
the control phreaks in Fido find it exists.
I will be gone the next two weeks, so the system may go down.  Don't expect
any response from me until then, either.   I will answer any mail when I
return.  In the meantime, I'm off tomorrow morning to enjoy Vincent
Cate's hospitality at the Anguilla cypherpunks meet.
