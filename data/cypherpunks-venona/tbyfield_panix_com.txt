Grassley's latest nonsense has got me thinking again about the rapidly
rising demonization of computers/networks/the net/etc. Remarks like...
        ...boggle the mind, since it'd be all but impossible to commit wire
fraud _without_ involving a "computer." The obvious effect of legislation
crafted according this kind of pseudo-thought would/will be to ensure that
there's a very firm line between, bluntly, haves and have-nots--"haves"
being those who are exempted by various legal machinations from this
ever-expanding universe of recriminalizations of the same old actions. If
Arthur commits wire fraud, he's making use of telcos' "computers" and wires
to commit fraud; is his action qualitatively different if he uses NetPhone
or Maven to accomplish exactly the same deed? If he uses a 12-yr-old
answering machine in the process, he probably isn't using a "computer" to
commit wire fraud; but if he uses a brand-new digital machine, or his kids
got him a Compaq Presario, and he uses it for voice mail--he probably _is_
using a "computer." It can't reasonably be argued that the use of newer
technology has any effect whatsoever--but it can of course be legislated.
We're seeing more and more of this addle-headed legislation coming down the
pike, and more and more of it will eventually become law: the effect, above
all, will be to make just about any use of a computer potentially quite
dangerous. For example, lying about your income on a credit card
application is, I'm told, potential bank fraud; if things continue as they
are, soon enough Mary could get slapped with yet another charge for
printing answers on her dishonest application rather than writing them by
hand. That isn't in any legislation I've seen, but how far off can it be?
        I know, I know, I'm preaching to the choir... Why? I'm going to
start working on an essay (and if the wind blows right, it'll be an op-ed)
about this hazy question--not that op-eds have much effect. :( Anyway, if
any of y'all have archived remarks by various Kongress types, pointers, dim
memories about spectacularly stupid statements, please send them my way off
list: the essay's going to focus not on legislation per so but, rather, on
the remarks that'll show how little these guys understand and how dangerous
their incomprehension is.

@_subject: Re: Pat Robertson Fears E-cash? 
This antinumerical tradition is, relevant biblical passages aside
(see also Daniel, Ezekiel, as well as assorted HB and NT Apocrypha) a
Protestant Anglo tradition that stretches back almost a thousand years to
the census that came to be know as the Domesday Book. Pop opposition to
censuses and the like are, AFAIK (and I know pretty far on this subject),
all but unheard of among e.g. predominantly Catholic cultures (how many
govts has the Italian peninsula seen?).
        Robertson isn't approaching this question _primarily_ from a policy
or humanist-liberal standpoint--he's approaching from a religious
standpoint: his duty as a preacher is to warn fellow Christians against
falling prey to Satan's machinations. And since the assignation of numbers
to people is, he feels, such a machination and a sign of the endtimes,
"fear" perhaps isn't the best word to describe his take on the future
(which in his view is a very bounded entity): while filled with
tribulations in which many of the devout will fail, the events of this era
prefigure Jesus's imminent return. This isn't to say that, in the absence
of Jesus's return (an absence of which I'm quite confident), Robertson's
recommendations don't have a policy potential or political
ramifications--on the contrary, they very likely will. Given the fact that
there's a longish prehistory to Christian interpretations of SS  UPC
symbols, etc. as the Mark of the Beast, it seems more likely that
fundamentalists will tend to view _stable_ numbers assigned by impersonal
institutions as the MotB, rather than, say, interpreting public keys--which
people themselves can generate and revoke at will--as the mark.
        It's fine with me if Robertson mobilizes Christian soldiers against
the governmental fracturing of privacy (note the irony in his acceptance of
"privacy" as a legit philosophical-legal doctrine in this context,
BTW)--it's just a shame that he has to mix these issues up with idiotic
references to Chaum's religion of birth, as though that was significant on
a par with Chaum's work. Needless to say, though, I'm a secular humanist.

Given the rate at which news of the prior cracks seems to have
spread among people quite new to these questions, I think you'd be
surprised: I've heard mention of it from no less than ten people who, to my
knowledge, had never before taken any interest whatsoever in crypto
questions. Granted, ten people a-laboring away on Pentiums and PPCs ain't
much--but, who knows?, my experience might just scale quite well.
        Yes, I know: Life is short and art is long. Still, I think it's
worth a try: failure seems likely and success remote, but how much sweeter
victory if the project were to succeed.
        The key, I think, would lie in making participation in the project
extremely accessible: developing simple platform-specific apps that'd make
sweeping space nearly idiot-proof. If joe.anne.net could DL an app
appropriate to hir platform then fill out field in a web page that would
delegate keyspace according to the question "I can let my [platform] run
for [n] hours," and easily report back the results, the response might be
quite strong. How long it would take to succeed, _if_ it did, is anyone's
guess: it could be a day or a decade.
        Obviously, the preparation would be a labor-intensive; the
trade-off, a good one imho, is that this labor having been performed, the
reservoir of potential contributors would expand manifold. If we could
increase the reservoir by a factor of 1000, which isn't at all unlikely,
that advance would be nothing to sneeze at.
        Cracking something that for now seems beyond reach would up the
ante in a pretty big way, and would put that much more pressure on
policymakers to jack that bit-limit up. And that's exactly what we want.

impossibility of consistent enforcement may well encourage a systemically
selective enforcement (maybe shaped by this or that, one's politics, for
example)? Presumably, then, law enforcement would take on an increasingly
"terroristic" character--"random," as IRS audits and the like can be.
        Some recent high-profile cases (Packwood, and Kenneth Starr's
efforts to indict Gov. Tucker) might indicate the shape that enforcement
could take, especially in light of some recent congressional legislative
efforts: the gov't investigates you regarding X, in the process of the
investigation turns up Y and Z, and thus finds reason maybe to look into A,
B, and C as well--in effect, turning your life into a nightmare.
        But I digress: The main point, really, is that enforcement doesn't
need to be nonselective to be "effective." I think this holds whether I
understood your remarks correctly or not.

one has to wonder what criterion is informing the selection. And this
"little" adventure could (IANAL, etc.) have a bright side: if the CJR were

so, maybe something halfway between a T-shirt and a book--y'all can figure

documented CJR, with an eye toward slowly upping the ante: submit the exact

It's not missing the point at all; what I find particularly
alarming is this half-measure situation we increasingly find ourselves in,
wherein the state farms out the drudgery of being a state but reserves to
itself the prerogative to govern by obscure fiat. Institutions like SAIC
aren't accountable in a way that gov't agencies at least theoretically are,
yet the continuing existence of those agencies amidst this move toward
privatization perpetuates this increasingly mythical idea of
"accountability." If everything's going to go private, fine, whatever,
let's make a go of it, and no one can tell me what software I can/can't use
and how much I can/can't deposit, etc.; OTOH, if the USG wants to reserve
the right to tell me what I can and can't do in these regards, then it had
bloody well better submit to the "responsibility" that goes with that
"right": accountability to the electorate.
        Why do you think the spooks make such prodigious use of cutouts? In
part because it's an effective way of evading detection; and,
unfortunately, oversight is a subset of detection. I'm sure SAIC does tons
of perfectly legitimate contract work--but I'm equally sure that it does
tons of covert work. And far too much covert work is covert for no other
reason than it's stupid (read my lips: "exploding giant clams") or--in the
case at hand--something that a rapidly growing sector of the electorate
rightly regards with suspicion.

Of course. The problem is that protocols as implemented permit
header-forging: it's a practical fact of the net, and one that maybe
shouldn't be overlooked on (basically vague) 'moral' grounds, any more than
Netscape should say, "Well, you just _shouldn't_ screw someone with a
foo.foo.foo.foo... URL." Of course people shouldn't overflow your stack
intentionally--but they _can_, and the implications of that fact are
shaping the net as we speak. If the headers were forged in such a way as to
falsely and _credibly_ attribute a transmission to an actual uninvolved
third-party, that's one thing; but the existence of headers that are forged
so incompetently as to be traceable to their actual origin suggests that
forged headers might be worth meditating on. For example, what if two or
three dozen independently maintained Mixmasters in three or four countries
randomly forged headers (maybe even actually badly, or maybe craftily
"badly") so as to make the last link in a chain look like one (or "one") of
the other remailers; how would the Co$ cope with that?

Yup.         In essence, remailers and other anonymizing/pseudonymizing

states have arrogated to themelves. Institutional dynamics aside, the
proverb that "A man reveals his character best when describing that of

and paragovernmental anti-anonymity arguments to focus on the most extreme
ways in which governments have used their power to modulate identity--i.e.,
        I don't want to start up a Cypherpunk[TM]-approved PR debate, but I
do think we (quote unquote) might do well to think a bit about some
arguments that can sidestep the arguments we can reasonably anticipate.
Plenty of folks have very recognizable nyms, so... nym as PO box, nym as a
way of tracking who's tracking you (like misspelling your name this or that
way when you know the organization you're giving it to will sell it), nym
as backup (for when your mailserver's down [yeah, I know...]). Anonymity,
after all, is only one of many possible uses for a remailer. No one could
possibly require that your email address bear your first and last names in
recognizable form--so what's so different about a nym?
        In terms of the fundamental issues, these are sidelights,
obviously, but they could come in handy. US culture has a deep-seated
mistrust of unstable identities (viz., the "con man") going back a century
or more; fighting on behalf of unstable and multiple identities will be an
upstream swim. But we might do pretty well arguing that remailers are more
similar to than different from net.staples--nutty email addresesses,
multiple addresses, etc.

It's important to distinguish between information that you've voluntarily released as such (e.g., giving someone your SSN) and information derived from analysis of your actions (e.g., repayment patterns, value-added with a proprietary scoring system) and/or consolidated from small releases of info here and there--and most of the material in a typical TRW or Equifax dossier is of the latter kind.
        ObCrypto? Vaguely. I've been thinking about the possibilities of "bullshit generators"--simple programs that would generate names and various kinds of facts about people who don't exist and "make this info available": email addresses to SSNs, addresses, credit histories, medical records, you name it. If "bullshit bots" became generally available and easy to implement, "information markets"--a phrase that's far too general to capture the complexity of the dynamics it refers to--would stratify pretty fast: groundfeeders like the fine folks who're now grepping newsfeeds for email addresses + interests could be laid waste to pretty fast by a handful of dormant newsgroups systematically flooded with posts from gjhfkj or poipoh Who'd pay for a DB that's half bogus? Alternatively: who'd pay to prevent their DB from being corrupted? Companies like Equifax would be harder to penetrate, but by no means beyond reach: there are so many people out there who they don't have files on yet--in ghettoes, in Eastern Europe--that they could be duped. We tend to think of information markets as markets for _true_ information; but as those markets mature, they'll breed parallel "counterweight" markets--markets, in essence, for _false_ information.

IPG, why don't you sit down and draw up the terms of a challenge?
        * what information and/or materials IPG will release
        * to whom it will release them and when
        * who is or isn't elligible
        * what you will and won't accept as "breaking your system"
        * the arbitrating body
        * a starting time and a deadline
        * the award
        You'd do well to be _very_ thorough in these terms, since any
perception that IPG was trying to throw the game would draw that much more
fire. You'd also do well to make terms terms conform to real-world
circumstances: for example, if someone hacking the office machines on which
which you generate, store, and/or disseminate RNs is a practical threat to
your product, then admit that as an acceptable part of a "break."

A few observations on Paul Strassman's response to John R. Levine; I've
rearranged it a bit for clarity, edited out a handful of lines, and
whittled down the CCs.
John R. Levine:
Paul Strassmann:
        Obviously, kidnapping and extortion demands sent anonymously
through the post would attract far more attention than innocuous uses
would--as did the recent incident in which someone donated (by anonymous
mail) a million-dollar McDonald's sweepstakes ticket to a children's
hospital. I daresay that for every such criminal instance you could cite,
there are hundreds or even thousands of instances of completely benign
"secret santas" and anonymous valentines from teenage "secret admirers,"
for example--which would hardly bear out your claim that
        Valentines and gifts sent anonymously will no doubt strike some
people as trivial in the face of "information warfare" and other such
gothic notions, and perhaps they are; but I can only wonder what exactly
these valiant strategists think they're protecting and from whom they're
protecting it.
        By the same token, the fact that law enforcement agencies have,
over the last two centuries, developed the forms of forensic analysis you
mention doesn't mean that these techniques are a god-given right whose
shortcomings in the face of new technologies need to be compensated for.
These techniques are, as you point out, contingent on the traits peculiar
to the objects being examined. Postal mail consists of integral physical
objects which can bear these kinds of traces; email does not. Nor does
shouting--yet I've never heard anyone suggest that fans at a football game
should preface what they yell with their name and their address, or that
their failure to do so constitutes a threat to national security.
        This objection remailers is a red herring: giveaway ten-hour
accounts on AOL and other services, hacked accounts, accounts obtained
under false names, and accounts obtained under a True Name are much more
notorious sources of spam than are remailers. If spam is your objection,
you're barking up the wrong tree.
        As for the "massive deployment of 'sniffers'," anyone capable of
doing this or of using information gained by this means hardly needs
        "Most likely scenarios" are speculative: something that hasn't
happened yet doesn't "always commence with" anything.
        This chicken-or-egg formulation suggests that a milieu in which
total traceability is possible would greatly diminish criminal behaviors
and activity. Perhaps, but as you yourself have pointed out, such a milieu
is utterly antithetical to anything remotely resembling a free democracy.
Since the alternative to untraceability isn't viable, there's no point in
bringing it up.
        If you were the final arbiter on the question, your repeated claim
that "remailers are here to stay" would be much more comforting.
Unfortunately, the force of almost all your arguments is, in a nutshell,
that remailers are associated with and facilitate criminal and/or terrorist
activities--and that suggests to me that if you had your druthers, they
would be illegalized.
        I'm curious: Do you or do you not support the continued existence
of nonregulated, nonlicensed, and publicly accessible remailers? (Please
note that this is a different question than "Are remailers here to stay?")

Only the shadow and a few bureaucrats know whether spooks have
infiltrated the remailer operators' web of trust. I'd imagine the payoff in
suggesting the possibility would lie in breeding mistrust not among
operators but, rather, among potential users: diminishing the use and
propagation of remailers would lower the overall noise level, making
case-by-case interception and cracking that much more manageable. But this
hall-of-mirrors speculation is really just misguided FUD: improving
protocols, more remailers, and expanding webs of trust are the prize to
keep our eyes on.

Question of how practical enforcement would be haven't been big in a lot of the legislation we've seen coming out of various capitals, so I doubt the situation for bureaucratic rule-mongering would be much different. The WP article said that has ACTA has "asked the [FCC] to stop this kind of communications and study how to regulate it," probably--and not surprisingly --in that order.         It looks like another case of trying to saddle ISPs with impossible enforcement burdens, though in this case one that a lot of ISPs might not mind so much, given the bandwidth that netphone usage eats up (cf. xs4all, I hear, has forbidden users to run CU-SeeMe).
        Q: Is it practically possible to find netphone traffic on a generic network at any level above the source and target addresses?

        That's a big if, given the priority such a tap would likely merit.
        Of the Mac apps I've seen (Maven, Cu-SeeMe Talk, and Netphone), the
last is by far the best. On startup it verifies registration by querying
the company's site, so it'd be easy enough to shut down at, at least for
now; but strangling it at that level would likely kill the company, which
would effectively orphan the code--a real factor, imo. In any case, there's
a crack floating around that circumvents this verification; obviously,
then, it'd also circumvent that method of enforcement.
        As for traffic characteristics, I've never seen one of these apps
work in full-duplex mode--just the allegedly fallback "push to talk" mode
(i.e., hold down the button while you yak, release it to listen), which
really changes the texture of a conversation--so the signal tends to be a
kind of high-volume call/response "negotiation" in slow-mo, with ~10-20
secs of transmission punctuated by null periods of about the same duration.
Ports are no problem, since the disassembly it'd take to rewrite the call
to another port would be minimal (and it'd be easy enough to make hack a
configurable port call to be arranged by mutual consent through plain old
UN*X Talk). The upshot being that signal analysis would be nontrivial--and,
from what I've read, the major telecom players aren't especially worried
that they'll lose business to this, so they'd likely resist getting saddled
with burdensome sniffing duties.
        And there's always PGPfone, which obviously flattens out signal
characteristics... heh heh.
        I think ACTA will make a valiant effort to ban this stuff, and the
FCC might listen--if only to safeguard its purview--but the only
"effective" way to enforce such a ban would be to impose yet another
policing duty on ISPs. Bandwidth aside, they've got better things to worry
about. And it'd be damned hard to work the public into a frenxy over free
long-distance phone calls.
        Basically, I think we got ourselves a winner.

part in any systematic effort among the G7+ to establish a transnational

the case have certainly _said_ they were looking into it; of course, maybe

somehow kind of doubt the plane was shot down by a US ship--as one friend
put it, they'd have to sink the entire ship to keep it a secret, but it'd
be hard to keep it a secret why they sunk the ship, etc., etc. And,
frankly, I doubt the FBI/NTSB/et al. really know what happened. Though I
doubt they'd keep on mentioning the missile theory without _very_ good
reason to believe it's likely.
