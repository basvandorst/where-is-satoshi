[Here I quote nobody who quotes remail
Nobody, when I read the original post I assumed the "we" you're talking
about was 'we, the Cypherpunks.'  I.e., if NSA were truly Evil Incarnate
Central, the Cypherpunks would be fighting "a Valiant War ["We Are Fated
to Lose"]".  For a moment there, nobody, you nearly had me believing
you.  But read the rest of the post, and the above 'slip' becomes much
less interesting:
[Me quoting nobody quoting remail again:]
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^
The NSA is caught up in bureaucracy, so the Cypherpunks need not lose.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Cypherpunks are not fated to lose, because the NSA's attempts are fated
to fail.
