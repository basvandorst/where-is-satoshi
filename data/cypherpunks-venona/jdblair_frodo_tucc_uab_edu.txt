Any lawyers on this list may want to correct me, but as I understand it contract law is *extremely* flexible concerning what a "signature" is.  It is perfectly legal to negotiate a contract via conventional, plaintext e-mail.  If you wrote a contract for me to sign and I wrote back "I accept this contract" then legally a contract would exist.  This is the same as if you phoned me, described a problem, and agreed to pay me to solve the problem.  Legally a contract would exist (though it would be foolish not to put the contract in writing in most situations).  The law is concerned more with the ritual of forming the contract (preferably by writing it on some medium that can be examined at a later date) followed by some sort of record that both parties agree on the contract they formed.  In fact, businesses work like this all the time.  The reason it works is that the best way to enforce a contract is to *trust* the person you're forming a contract with.
Obviously, just negotiating a contract via e-mail is dangerous.  All of us know there are ways to forge or repudiate parts or all of this transaction.  A paper signature, just like a digital signature, is an excellent tool for non-repudiation (You say: I didn't sign that!  Your opponent says: we know you signed this b/c this is your handwriting/public key/etc).  Whether or not it seems to be a good idea from the viewpoint of computer science is irrelevant-- the law focuses on the *ritual,* not the specific form of the document.
Note-- I'm deriving this statement from a study that I did on digital signatures in contract law that was part of my undergraduate thesis.  I am not a legal expert.  If I am totally off-base please explain to me where I am wrong so I may revise my notions concerning contract .                                                                    .

Netscape just announced that they're going to release the source code to Communicator 5.0 with a license that allows modification and redistribution "in the heritage of the GNU Public License."  No details on the specific license yet, but it sounds *very* hopeful.
The point is... we *will* be able to add all the funky new features we want.  Complaining about the browser will no longer be acceptable now that we will be able to *do* something about it.  It also means that Microsoft will get to compete head-to-head with a real free software model.  This is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate what the free software model can do.  I can already envision non-Netscape "distributions," custom browser modifications for big customers, etc.

Ahh... I remember now why I re-subscribed to Cypherpunks.  It was for all of the intelligent discussion that goes on here.  At least back in the days of Detweiler the character assassination was creative and often fun to read.
Can you please keep childish shots like this in private e-mail?  It has no place in this mailing list.

@_subject: opinion of Crypt::DES & Crypt::IDEA 
Does anybody on this list have an opinion of the quality of the Crypt::DES and Crypt::IDEA perl modules?  I'm concerned with whether or not the modules use electronic code book instead of cipher block chaining encryption mode.  The documentation does not make this clear.  If nobody knows the answer to this I'll figure it out from the source code.  However, I suspected I could save some time by asking here.
Besides this question, does anybody have an opinion of the quality of these routines?  I'm not asking for opinions regarding the quality or lack of quality of DES or IDEA, but of these particular thanks much,

Suggest that Microsoft encourage peer review of of the portions of IE used for encryption and authentication by publishing the source code used to implement these functions.  The quality of the code would certainly improve (I don't believe it could get worse ;) if MS incorporated suggestions in a timely matter.  Such a move would also do much to improve Microsoft's reputation in the "hacker" community (that's "hacker" in the good sense, not the intruder/cracker/vandal sense) by showing that they understand that "security through obscurity is no security."  If Microsoft (and other companies) hear about the need to do this often enough from enough different source, perhaps they will begin to listen.
