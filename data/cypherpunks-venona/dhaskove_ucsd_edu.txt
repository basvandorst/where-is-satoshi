The New York Times online site reports on a researcher at Oak Ridge National
Labs who "devised and patented a new mathematical system for encrypting and
authenticating digital data, based on the scientific concept of chaos."  The
article mention that people in industry were less than enthused about
adopting it.  Even the inventor says that it "isn't robust enough for
military applications."  It seems to use a chaotic system at both ends with
a symmetric key.  It almost sounds like the NYT covered it because chaos is
"cool", not because this development is significant.  Any insights?

Here's the reply I got from a friend that I forwarded it to....
     and the verdict is... NetMYTH!  I checked the cite in the article on      cyberterrorism... no such article ran on 6/2/96 in the Times      (London)... nor, in fact, in any newspaper available on Nexis...      just thought I would let you know...

I stand corrected.... I wonder if this will be / has been picked up by any Stateside media?  It seems like something that might sell papers....
