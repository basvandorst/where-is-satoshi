industrial base to maintain (well, non-guerilla operations anyway) like never.
Salting crop land, poisoning wells, burning cities--long before Sherman marched on Atlanta civilians were targets. The Aristocracy didn't approve publically, but what does a blockade accomplish if not to deprive civilians of certain things? Yes, it also keeps it out of the hands of the Military, but it also affects non-military. very impressionable age (young men). Watching your friends and buddies die is a tough thing for most, as is killing other people. For most people killing is not something to be done lightly, and it is necessary to work them into a state were killing is possible. This state also tends to make certain actions seem like a good idea. Nuking of Japan, well, when is the last time a Political leader (and High Ranking Generals ARE Political Leaders) actually stopped to consider the lives or feelings of people that aren't going to vote for hir?

difference, but as the dumbest person on the list, I figure I can learn from just about anyone here. Not that I am calling Mr. Bell a fool.
about it, Which processor? Intel (all variants) Motorola (all variants), Digital (Alpha) etc. When it would be easier (It seems to me at least) to develop a system that _can_ find that needle in a hay stack, and simply develop translators for each kind of chip (which could be done in software I'd think) to show what the chip is doing. what the person is typing as well as what is on the screen. As well as get Voice etc.
idea and a tempest style attack, it isn't thought through real well, but I _think_ it would work. "repeater" that takes that band, encodes it, steps it to a different band and retrans it. This device probably could be made small enough to fit _easily_ inside a case, and draw very little power (the transmitting distance would not need to very far) and since most people never open their cases, it would be fairly safe from detection. It could even be designed to piggyback on common device interface cards (parallel/serial cards, Video cards) so that even if one _did_ open ones case you probably wouldn't notice.
B&E. This wouldn't solve the problem of decoding, but it heats the needle, and makes it sound off at many times less cost than subverting the chip. Petro, Christopher C.

@_subject: [NOISE] Was Re: CryptoAnarchy: What's... Is now a long ramble. 
Oh god, I'd doomed. I think I am gonna wind up on Mr. Bells side in this one. Please also note that I am cc:ing this to an individual who is both more knowlegable about certain aspects of the following, and interested in certain aspects of this.
Military technology doesn't have a lot to do with it. It is modern stratagies and tactics that make things difficult. In a "popular uprising" (in quotes because most aren't) an organized armed group will devistate(spelling?) a mob, and the technology necessary to do this is at least 30 years old. an ages old an respected solution. Take out the leaders. Note, I am _not_ suggesting Mr. Bells assination politics, rather, given a violent revolution, or the beginings of one, shorten it by taking those who make the policies you disagree with.
and you HAVE to do the job quickly, and take out as much of the leadership as possible, otherwise your job gets much more dificult. isn't the TECHNOLOGY that is the problem, rather the strategy.  either a) drug the person you are strangling so they don't notice, or to simply break their neck? (I.e. make it so they don't notice they are strangling until it is too late, if ever, or to do it so quickly that they don't have time to react? In this case I think the second would be the most difficult. (Note, you must use a graphical browser)
passports to anyone who is a citizen. Citizenship is confered (apparently)
on anyone who is willing to agree to their "constitution". These passports
are being accepted (apparently, tho' I couldn't find the list of counties
that accept them.) I disagree quite strongly with MANY of the rules/laws
that their constituion establishes, but the idea interests me. New Slovenia isn't a (at this point my command of the language breaks
down, or maybe there isn't an exact word for it) State. Basically, it is a
Nation without borders, where citizenship is a matter of allegence rather
than geographical location/birth. I don't know a whole lot about it, as
those particular pages are entirely GIFs, and I am not a patient person. It got me to thinking (yeah, you probably saw the smoke). The idea that citizenship--or whatever it would be called--is based on things other than nationality (although NSK is a nationalist organization) is not new, but with (Cypherpunk tie in) the ability for people to communicate freely across borders, would it be possible set up something similar along other lines? Semantic Note: from this point on in this ramble, Nation will be used to
describe a political entity based on philosphical allegance ala NSK, and
State will be used to describe a geographically based political entity
would be a major difficulty (Understatement). Convincing others as to the necessity would be damn near impossible tho'. (I am starting to think of many many more obsticles. Law enforcement etc) nuclear) attack. Simply, no land, nothing for a military to take and hold. Then agression against this posited nation would either devolve into police actions on known "citizens" and/or economic "warfare". a digital cash type system) by States refusing to allow certain National banks to convert currency in their jurisdiction. etc.
becomes easier and easier to hide income via anonymity, these Nations or at least their bank[s] could act as arbiters/agents in taxation, paying the states for services rendered based on their population in a given state. physical matters such as roads, parks etc. operating on Service based taxes (gas taxes for roads, entrance fees for Parks etc. VAT to pay for police & fire depts) and the Nations take care of economic interests such as financial security currency exchange etc.

opponents know about the legislation, it also lets the proponents know, and they supposedly send faxes and email in support. the rise. Hell, listen to talk radio for a while, and you tell me if these are the people YOU want running the country. They are motivated enough to call in and/or vote, but they aren't motivated enough to actually stop and think about the subject, much less learn about it. decesions, only that many of them are not equipped to sort out the complexites, nor are they willing to think long term about things. Unfortunately this is also true of our leadership. Petro, Chistopher C.
