@_subject: Viral encryption 
Greetings, gentlemen and ladies.
Having just subscribed to this mailing list, I have several
interesting questions to pose, not exactly knowing which end
of the candle to light first.
First off, my background does include some cryptological
overtones. As a non-comissioned officer in the US Army, I
was a COMSEC systems integrator and a COMSEC account custodian.
(Anyone who may be familiar with the job knows the complexities
of involvement.) I now earn my keep as a network systems
integration consultant (great buzzwords) for a highly respected
(and major) computer consultant firm based in the  Washington,
DC area -- far removed from the crypto-analytical sciences
that you folks have an active interest. This job keeps me in the
New York city area four days a week (What personal life?).
Secondly, my professional area of expertise is networking (granted,
it _does_ pat the bills). My personal area of expertise (and
enjoyment), is DOS based computer virus "research". I was weened
in IBM system 360/370 assembler (once upon a time) and am quite
adept in the INTEL 80x86 assembler set. (Ralf Brown is one of my
heros.) I "de-program" for hobby; taking things (viruses) apart
to study their possible "interaction" and ability to cause major
problems (sometimes they really do). You're probably telling yourself at this point, "Gee, I wish this
guy would cut to the chase!" On that note -- I shall. ;-)
In the past year, the DOS world has been confronted with several
(two, significantly -- the MtE and more recently the TPE) encryption
"engines" which are being used as "envelopes" for existing viruses.
(Stay with me, now.) They are being called "polymorphs" by those
"in-the-know"; more specifically, polymorphic viruses. The
encryption is weak, compared to DES or RSA comparisons, but they do
pose a major problem to the computer community because of the
technological weaknesses of the antivirus product developers.
Algorithmic development is not exactly their bag of tricks, in most
cases. Most are reliant on pattern matching and have fits when
presented with code that is _totally_ static.
Although (I realize that) this conference newsgroup seems
dedicated to privacy and ciphering-related issues, I'm just curious
as to what exposure some of you may have with this type of problem.
(I used to have Kelly Goen to bounce ideas off of, but he seems to
have dropped out of the public eye a few years ago, but yet I see
his name mentioned in the PGP docs.)
Any serious responses are quite welcomed at fergp
Public interest responses (I'd hope) will suffice in this area.
Cheers from Manhattan.

 My apologies for strayiing even further from the topic, but
 Phyber's comments would not let me let this sleeping dog lie.
 Strictly using DEBUG is a bit ridiculous for the "masses", but I
 can understand your sentiment, at least to that end. As far as
 I'm concerned, I can isolate _any_ change in my operating
 environment (be it DOS, Novell NOS, UNIX or whatever, for that
 matter) with the utilities that accompany the operating system
 (and of course, a couple of home-brewed ones to boot). Viruses
 are simply nuisances, for those who are adept enough to bop
 around in assembly code.
 Your disdain for "anti-virus software" is shared by many -- even
 shared by myself, to a certain degree. Every time I read an
 advertisement in a trade rag that boasts, "Can now find and eradicate
 new and unknown viruses!" or "Now! Can kill the deadly Mutation
 Engine virus!", I can only shake my head and snicker.
 However, there are a couple of genuine "good guys" out there in
 computer land that produces some excellent "anti-virus" software.
 Dr. Alan Solomon (UK) and Fridrik Skulason (Iceland), both of whom I
 know personally, produce perhaps the most effective and timely virus
 detection software in the business. Yes, they both will tell you that
 they use DEBUG to trace code and disassemble.
 Sara told me that you were rather impetuous. ;-)
 Further discussions relating to thhis topic should be moved to
 comp.virus (virus-l or directed to me by email.

@_subject: Unforgotton topic 
I realize that this has already been an old topic amonst you folks,
but I just wanted to post a summary I found rather striking and an
issue I know still leaves a bad taste in our collective mouths -
"Threats to Privacy", "FBIs Wiretapping Proposal Thwarted", extracted
from Boardwatch Magazine, February, 1993, pages 19 - 22 ( BBS
Legislative Watch, Shari Steele, EFF) -
"In a move that worried privacy experts, software manufacturers and
telephone companies, the FBI proposed legislation to amend the
Communications Act of 1934 to make it easier for the Bureau to perform
electronic wiretappiing. The proposed legislation, entitled 'Digital
Telephony,' would have required communications service providers and
hardware manufacturers to make their systems 'tappable' by providing
'back doors' through which law enforcement officers could intercept
communications. Furthermore, this capability would have been provided
undetectably, while the communications was in progress, exclusive of
any communications between other parties, regardless of the mobility
of the target of the FBI's investigation, and without degradation of
"The privacy implications are frightening. Today, all sorts of
information about who we are and what we do, such as medical records,
credit reports and employment data, are held on electronic databases.
If these databases have government-mandated 'tappability,' this
private information could be accessed by anyone tapping in. In
addition, the language in the proposed bill is vague. This is
especially troubling since, under the proposal, the Department of
Justice (DOJ) can keep communications products off the market if it
determines that these products do not meet the DOJ's own vague
guidelines. This will probably result in increased costs and reduced
competitiveness for service providers and equipment manufacturers,
since they will be unlikely to add any features that may result in a
DOJ rejection of their entire product. And to add insult to injury,
the FBI proposal suggests that the cost of this wiretapping 'service'
to the Bureau would have to be borne by the service provider itself,
which ultimately means you and I will be paying higher user fees.
"The Electronic Frontier Foundation organized a broad coalition of
public interest and industry groups, from Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibilty (CPSR) and the ACLU to AT&T and Sun
Microsystems, to oppose the legislation. A white paper produced by
the EFF and ratified by the coalition, entitled, 'An Analysis of the
FBI Digital Telephony Proposal,' was widely distributed throughout the
Congress. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) and Representative Don
Edwards (D-California), chairs of two key committees, referred to the
EFF paper as they delayed the introduction of the FBI's proposal. As
Leahy stated before the Senate, 'Our goal is to assist law
enforcement,' but 'without jeopardizing privacy rights or frustrating
the development of new communications technologies.' The Justice
Department lobbied hard in the final days to get Congress to take up
the bill before Congress adjourned, but the bill never even found a
Congressional sponsor (and was therefore never officially introduced).
The FBI will almost certainly reintroduce "Digital Telephony" when the
103rd Congress convenes in January."

@_subject: Enough's enough already 
Excuse me for dropping my two cents in here, but just what's the big,
hairy deal?
I apologize for initially bringing up the topic of self-encrypting
viruses; had I known that folks would have reacted in such a childish
manner, I would never have posted that topic at all.
For those of you who wish to discuss it further, I'd suggest posting
to comp.virus in the future. I suppose I would take it a tad more
seriously when reading some of the posts that have drifted through
this area, if they were originally posted to an area that was
designed for virus banter.
If this sounds like a plea for some sort of sanity check, then I
must be coming across loud and clear.
Now, I'd like to ask the cypherpunk readership to clarify the need (or
perhaps a better term may be "desire") for anonymous remailers? Maybe
I'm not getting the "big picture", but it would appear to me that
insurance of private communications is the area of intended interest
here. I know that someone may declare my query as naive, but if you
feel strongly enough about a topic, why wouldn't you want the
recipient to know who you are, where you are and who they can respond
I think my train of thought is geared towards anon remailers
protecting those who may operate in less than honorable means, without
ethical guidelines and wishing to "hide" behind a veil of anonymity.
Somehow, that just strikes me as less-than-honorable. (No, I was never
a Marine. Army, yes. Marine, no.)
Gee, I sure feel better.

 Point taken, however there will be those who will argue that, "S & M
 has no business being discussed on the net in the first place." Not
 exactly my sentiment, but you know the spiel. That type  of
 "Stalinist dictatorship" mentality inherently exists in every nook and
 cranny of society, including the nets.
 My original post was not issued as a challenge, but merely a question
 to gauge some of the responses and justifications I hoped to receive.  Cheers.

@_subject: Let's look at this .... 
Okay, cypherpunks -
I've watched enough "unsubscribe me" requests drop in, now I figure
(that's a Virginia word, BTW) that since I'm silently digesting most
of this nonsense, I can at least crop a few pennies in the mill from
time to time.
I've managed to irk several of you with the virus encryption post (a
bona fide topic, for those of you who snicker); then with the "Why
Anon (especially when there are twelve step programs) ?", but the
federal deficit is peanuts to popcorn compared to the bandwidth wasted
Lest I begin to resemble some cypher-drop-out (never happen), let's
re-examine what we are now discussing:
o Problems (solved yet?) with penet.fi
o Arguments and innuendo regarding:
   _ digital cash
   _ digital anarchy (Gee, thanks, Tim.)
   _ digital bad-mouthing
The one topic that _does_ interest me is the nonsensical fodder
stemming from a post regarding the (actual?) governmental
consideration to license keys. That just drops my carrier.
This is probably the one reason why I tolerate the wasted bandwidth
here -- there are many powerful souls amongst you (us) who can keep this
bullshit from happening.
On a serious note, I have been a programmer-slash-analyst from the
card-punch days of not_so_old. My assembly programming began in the
bowels of a IBM 360; somehow that weeded it's way into the desktop
arena. Damned odd.
Now I just put networks together. Much like tinker toys.
My (long-winded) question is this: What are cypherpunk priorities?
(NO, no, please do not cite the norms. I've heard 'em.)
Where are we going with anon mailers? Are they going to serve us or
cause us unlimited problems? (From a political point of view?)
I stand _strongly_ behind private communications, and behind the right
to privately encrypt. Personally, I do not think that it can be taken
away from us.

 This is perhaps the most difficult feat to accomplish. Education and
 "awareness" are both strictly accomplished on a somewhat voluntary
 basis. For those who can absorb the importance and criticality of
 digital privacy, however, it's an eye-opener. A lot of folks have no
 idea how some of the proposed "legislation" would affect them
 personally.

Steve Jackson Games/Secret Service wrapup
By JOE ABERNATHY Copyright 1993, Houston Chronicle [no date given]
 AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret Service
 closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal District Judge Sam
 Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a proper investigation in a
 notorious computer crime crackdown, and went too far in retaining
 custody of seized equipment.
 The judge's formal findings in the complex case, which will likely set
 new legal precedents, won't be returned until later.  [...]
 The judge's rebuke apparently convinced the Department of Justice to
 close its defense after calling only ... one of the several government
 witnesses on hand.  "The Secret Service didn't do a good job in this
 case.  We know no investigation took place.  Nobody ever gave any
 concern as to whether (legal) statutes were involved.  We know there
 was damage," Sparks said in weighing damages.
 The lawsuit, brought by Steve Jackson Games of Austin, said that the
 seizure of three computers violated the Privacy Protection Act, which
 provides First Amendment protections against seizing a publisher's works
 in progress.  The lawsuit further said that since one of the computers
 was being used to run a bulletin board system containing private
 electronic mail, the seizure violated the Electronic Communications
 Privacy Act in regards to the 388 callers of the Illuminati BBS.
The testimony described by Joe was rather strange.  Agents testified that
there was no criminal connection, they were not even trained in the
Privacy Protection Act, and it took them only an hour to discover the
true nature of the situation.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation spent
over $200,000 bringing this case to trial.  The legal ramifications are
considerable. Perhaps someone from EFF will contribute an analysis to
RISKS, although many EFFers (and I) are at Computers, Freedom, and
Privacy 93 this week.  Don't hold your breath, but perhaps we need to
wait for the judge?  PGN

 I think that you guys are missing the point here. IMHO, if you wish
 maximum assurance of security, than I'd suggest not trying to run
 programs such as PGP on a multi-user system to begin with! What's
 wrong with using a PC for this? It offfers a maximum convenience,
 single-user secure system quite unlike the security problems
 associated with your university's mainframe.
 The PC offers the communications availability and the flexibilty to
 provide an extremely high level of privacy, if you know what you're
 doing.
 You should try it sometime ....
 Cheers.

@_subject: Let's see here ... 
Once again, I pull together my collective thoughts (that _was_
rather difficult) and send them along for the remainder of the
cypherpunks to ponder.
It would appear that several things have happened; let's see if I can
summarize -
- The Clinton administration was presented with a golly-gee proposal
from either the NSA or the NIST (probably both) on a way to "offer"
public encryption. ('Nuf said.)
- From what we have surmised (researched, hypothesized and down-right
taken for face value), the government (whether it be the NIST or
whomever) has obviously been working on this "technology" for a few
years. Albeit, their negligence to inform anyone.
- Mr. Clinton and crew obligingly acknowledge this new, technological
wonder, and think that they're doing us all a favor.
- Enter the "Clipper Chip", and all it's fanfare.
Okay. I took The Dark One's advice (not that I needed the prodding,
mind you) and faxed every one of the contacts on the list that he
posted earlier (a couple of which were voice numbers, BTW). The big
three (ABC, NBC and CBS + CNN) got my fax and my thoughts on the
subject. I'm mad as hell, too -- yet I'm more prone to bringing this
highly volatile subject (it would seem that it's only an explosive
situation to those of us who understand it's implications) into the
public eye. Let's put this topic into proper prospective -- for the
layman, for the "man in the streets."
Let me try to put this into prospective for some of our less
politically inclined participants.
For those of you who live within earshot of the "Beltway", you are
probably familiar with the G. Gordon Liddy radio show. Well, to make a
long story short, one afternoon the topic was computer crime. A young
man called in to express  his concern with the topic of "underground"
computer virus distribution and all that rot. He was talking on a deaf
ear, folks. The program was dominated by yuppies, calling in worried
about their precious credit records and how they could possibly be
disclosed or damaged by the computer criminals. I turned off the show
in disgust at that point, but the point is this: No matter how hard
you attempt to bring matters into the light that the _computer_ public
should be concerned about, they revert into their own realm of
protected computerdom. This is an observation, not a conviction.
What we need to do, is to make folks understand that this is not just
a computer issue -- it's privacy issue, for cryin' out loud! If the
techno-fascists within certain levels of government service think that
they can _impose_ their will on the computer community at large, they
are most definately ill-informed.  Most would probably think that they
could fluff this little tidbit of "legislation" into reality.
Bottom line: I stand by the ideals that we have every right, as common
citizens, to encrypt and cipher as we see fit. Legality be damned.
(This is not a legality issue, for christ's sake!) This is an issue
where the government is playing bully and we find ourselves on the
receiving end of their quest for superiority.
I urge each and every one of you to take the time to write your
congressman, fax the closest televison or radio station and make this
topic as public as possible!
I refuse to be treated like a criminal because I desire electronic
Say "No".
Oh. By the way, I'm looking for some kind sort to offer an avenue to

I hope this goes over well. I found this article to be just what we need --- publicity. The kind that opens eyes. Tim, Eric and John -- I sat to thee, "How come this only happens in California?"  ;-)

            From the "For What It's Worth Department"...
   A totally biased review of Steven Levey's "Crypto Rebels" article in
             WIRED, Volume 1, Issue 2, May/June 1993
I was a bit interested when a fellow cypherpunk mentioned that there
was a "decent" write-up in WIRED on the cypherpunk issues. Somehow, I
envisioned some sidebar mention. In these interesting times, any
mention of our efforts on the computer privacy frontier gets A-1
attention in my book. However, I was startled (and pleasantly
surprised) when I took a jaunt down to my local magazine-ary on
Broadway and found that my internaut campadres were on the cover, no
less. Golly gee, imagine that.
The cover itself conjures images of computer cultist symbolism. Tim
May, Eric Hughes and John Gilmore strike an interesting pose wearing
plain white, plastic carnival masks. The American flag held in their
hands is even more striking considering the topic at hand. (What the
hell does the Russian inscription mean?) I remember reading the post
announcement in the cypherpunks mail area about that meeting in
Mountain View. (If I had known that you western cypherpunks
would get all the press attention, I would've hopped a red-eye and
met you guys at Cygnus.) It's ironic that this topic built steam and
attention _before_ the "Clipper Chip" fiasco and still provides the
computer community with viable (perhaps not altogether proper)
alternatives. I knew it would. Ha.
Steven Levey has long since established himself as a solid, factual
and sometimes thought-provoking writer. His book "Hackers" is
considered by many professionals in the field to be the authoritative
work on the progression of computer hackers. Levey earns himself one
more brownie badge by bringing attention to the cypherpunk dilemma. The
article is thought provoking (read: it is not designed for
disinterested parties), accurate and for the most part, right on the
Key statements are sprinkled on the page margins, including "In the
Cypherpunk mind, cryptography is too important to leave to government
or even well-meaning companies. To insure that the tools of privacy
are available to all, individual acts of heroism are required." That
piece alone is enough to invoke thoughts of ...
A key profile is included about John Gilmore and his headaches with
the NSA, the Cypherpunk subscription mail group and several other
side-bar notes that lend some valuable credibility to the otherwise
incredulous auspices of the cypherpunk image.
Not only is this article well written, as far as information blurbs
go, this is good stuff, even for us neanderthals on the east coast.
In a broader aspect, WIRED is a magazine that deserves your attention.
Pick up this rag and give it the once-over. Somehow, I classify this
'zine as a combination of INFO World, The New Yorker and Mondo 2000.
Isn't that a draw? Humor and seriousness implied...

 You're right, Eric -- we are mad as hell, too. But I'm not about to
 jump on a flight to the west coast to simply share strategies. The
 fact that I would even consider it negates the functions which we are
 working towards, no? I propose that us east coasters organize and
 meet as well. Pat and I are DC bourne, for those interested, I'd like
 to propose a DC local meeting. Suggestions? Keep in mind that I'm in
 NYC during the week, so my only available meeting times aare on the
 weekends. (By the way, lets get our shit together DC'ers. We need

 Your DC based Cypherpunk group is hereby established. BTW, if anyone

Piercing              5               -              2
1. Cryptography
Cryptography continues to rise in popularity as the solution for all
digital ills. The use of the software encryption package Pretty Good
Privacy (PGP) for e-mail is now tres hip among the network elites,
and public keys are being traded like baseball cards. Of course,
encryption is just a way to hide the same boring messages, but it
does add that element of intrigue. Crypto-philes are a '90s version of
the NRA gun nuts: paranoid of the government's attempts to legislate,
and coonvinced that their guns (codes) are necessary for freedom. "If
encryption is outlawed, only outlaws will have encryption," is already
splattered around the Net.
2. Wireless Everything
There seems to be an unwritten rule nowadays that every product
announcement must trumpet the fact that the new gizmo is, even if
only in some minor way, wireless.  We now have wireless mice,
keyboards, modems, printers, and networks. The once-esoteric
deliberations concerninng radio bandwidth auctioning have become
front page news in the Wall Street Journal. What's strange is that
there is no corresponding consumer clamor for wireless products. In
fact, wireless keyboards and printers have flopped every time thay have
been introduced. But don't expect this to stop Buck Rogers-obsessed
electronics companies anytime soon.
3. Wired
The glut of recent media hype surrounding this new rag is proof the
WIRED staff has read and understood its Marshall McLuhan. Through
deliberate manipulation of broadcasters, spin-doctored press releases,
and billboards everywhere, WIRED has achieved near total ubiquity,
including spots on everything from Good Morning America to NPR. While
the mainstream media looks on in disbelief, the reaction on the Net
has been more divided. Some on alt.cyberpunk see it as the unholy
offspring of M2 and the Economist, while others see it as a rehash of
the Same Old Stuff, down to the obligatory article on virtual sex.
Like VR, it's a viewpoint-dependent medium.
4. EFF Sells Out
The Electronic Frontier Foundation's announcement of their
reorganization and the closure of their Cambridge office was greeted
with cries of betrayal and the ripping of membership cards. Many
people on the Net saw the reorganization as a move by the EFF towards
a more slick-corporate-Washington D.C.-Clinton-ass-kicking type of
organization. The critics have grossly exaggerated the charges, but
there is a kernel of truth to them: The EFF gets most of its financial
support from large corporations such as AT&T and Apple, and John Perry
Barlow has admitted that this has influenced the EFF's actions. (Heck,
how many times hhave you seen John Sculley standing next to Clinton
in the past four months?) But a well-endowed EFF is sure to be more
effective than a politically correct one -- we just need to hope that
what is best for Apple is also best for us.
5. Piercing
Body piercing has been hyped for the last five years, but only
recently has it really caught on in the computer community. Now it
seems as though every programmer in San Jose has a pierced nipple and
is eagerto tell you about it. As Jaron Lanier said, piercing is the
only thing left that can still get a rise from a teenager's ex-hippy
parent. Cyberpunk lit has always emphasized body malfunctions, from
fake eyes to knives implanted under yourr finger nails, and piercing
is a cheap and easy way to be like your heros -- and it;s oh so
rebellious. I just hope that liposuction becomes the next big trend
with this group.

Trying to (-e) encrypt a textfile with someone's pubkey produces both
"DOS general read errors" and "device not ready" errors. I suspect
that PGP is using some direct BIOS calls for this, which bypass
Stacker, however I haven't looked at the source code yet. (Silly me.)
Every other function of PGP that I have utilized seems to work okay.
After invoking PGP with the following parameters -
PGP -e text.txt userid
I get these errors. Also, after being bumped back out to the system
prompt, any further requests to access the file system is greeted with
the same errors. (Lucky me.) Anyway, after rebooting the system and
fixing the file allocations errors (yes, usually two to three files
created by PGP named filename.$01, filename.$02, etc. are classified
by DOS as mis-allocated), everything is just peachy. Like I said
before, all othere PGP functions (adding and validating keys, etc)
work okay.
I point the finger at Stacker, but I figured it might be worth my time
to toss a message into the group for advice...
For what it's worth, I don't normally use Stacker for the same reasons
that Steve Gibson forbids his employees to use any disk compression
software -- the problems and possibilty for irreversible data loss
greatly outweigh the silly need to compress.

Although it's not directly related to the cypherpunks agenda,

law enforcement agencies will go to do their bidding. Unfortunately,
it would appear that we can expect more of the same shady behaviour in
the future.
8<------ Begin forwarded message ----------
Reply-To: David Sobel Sender: Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
Organization: CPSR Civil Liberties and Computing Project
  New disclosures in 2600 case
        As you may recall, last November at a shopping mall outside of
Washington, DC, a group of people affiliated with the computer magazine
"2600" was confronted by mall security personnel, local police officers
and several unidentified individuals.  The group members were ordered to
identify themselves and to submit to searches of their personal property.
Their names were recorded by mall security personnel and some of their
property was confiscated.  However, no charges were ever brought against
any of the individuals at the meeting.
        Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility ("CPSR") filed
suit under the Freedom of Information Act and today received the Secret
Service's response to the FOIA lawsuit, in which we are seeking agency
records concerning the break-up of the meeting.  I think it's safe to say
that our suspicions have now been confirmed -- the Secret Service *did*
obtain a list of names from mall security identifying the people in
attendance at the meeting.
        There are three main points contained in the Secret Service's
court papers that are significant:
        1) The agency states that the information it possesses
concerning the incident was obtained "in the course of a criminal
investigation that is being conducted pursuant to the Secret
Service's authority to investigate access device and computer fraud."
        2) The agency possesses two relevant documents and the
information in those documents "consists solely of information
identifying individuals."
        3) The information was obtained from a "confidential source,"
and the agency emphasizes that the FOIA's definition of such a source
includes "any private institution which provided information on a
confidential basis."
        Taken together, these facts seem to prove that the Secret
Service wanted names, they had the mall security people collect them,
and they came away from the incident with the list they wanted.
        The agency asserts that "[t]he premature release of the
identities of the individual(s) at issue could easily result in
interference to the Secret Service's investigation by alerting these
individual(s) that they are under investigation and thus allowing the
individual(s) to alter their behavior and/or evidence."
        CPSR, in conjunction with EFF and the ACLU, is planning to
challenge the actions of the mall security personnel, the local
police and the Secret Service on the ground that the incident
amounted to a warrantless search and seizure conducted at the
behest of the Secret Service.

@_subject: Aiding the cause (or, Spreading the word) 
For those of you who do not receive the comp.risks feed, the Wiretap
Chip (Clipper) is debate is taking hold on several forefronts. What
this tells me is this: People are starting to realize the negative
implications of this Big Brother "technology."
I say: Great, but there's alot of eyes to open out there and we need
to let Joe and Janet Lunchbucket know how this will affect them.
8<------ Begin forwarded message ------------------------
(At the risk of redundancy (with other contributors)):
1. Although gov't press releases and gov't surrogates like Dorothy
Denning keep talking about warrants (actually, they say "proper
authorization") for Clipper keys, the government has never abandoned
(and does not even deny) the practice of conducting warrantless
wiretaps for "national security" reasons. How will keys be obtained
to decrypt such intercepts?  My guess--the security of the "escrow"
agencies will be secretly compromised.  And then, the time will
come when the NSA turns over political or criminal information with
little or no "national security/foreign/military intelligence" content
to the FBI, etc.  My fallback guess is that the Skipjack algorithm
will have a back door.
2. The key escrow scheme is a pottery container of fecal matter.
Right now in California we are enjoying two scandals involving the
release, to unauthorized persons, of "secret" data, by employees of
government and private organizations, in violation of: their
employers' policies, their own terms of employment, state criminal
law, and common (civil) law.  These (Anaheim PD employee release
of DMV address info to anti-abortion terrorists; various people
including police employees giving info to an ADL investigator) are
representative, not exhaustive of the problem.  Does anybody remember
the Walker (U.S. Navy) spy scandal of a few years ago?  Walker ring
members, despite vetting by the military (perhaps inefficient, but
more thorough than likely in civilian agencies), exposure to the
most severe legal sanctions, and even the cultural pressures of
their military communities, sold out Navy cipher secrets and keys
to actual enemies for fairly small amounts of money. N.B.: the
Walker ring had no ideological motivations.  Anyone who says that
the key escrow scheme will protect the privacy of Clipper users is
naive, stupid, or wicked.  Of course, as someone will point out:
"the Walker ring got caught!"--but catching malefactors will not
prevent the harm they do before they are detected.
3. The assertion that the government should, by rights, be able to
decrypt private communications for "law enforcement" purposes
should be challenged.  Privacy advocates should not concede this
important debate-framing assumption. Advances in digital computing
have made it possible for ordinary people to use powerful machine
cipher techniques.  But such systems will not prevent police
agents from eavesdropping directly or by various bugging methods.
It may be (I suspect it is so) that depriving the police of
convenient wiretapping might have little effect over, say, ten
years, on their (police) ability to detect and interfere with

@_subject: Wiretap Chip and Key Escrow Abuses 
I've been following the discussions on several newsgroups and
mailing lists (RISKS, PRIVACY and Cypherpunks) concerning the
Wiretap Chip (Clipper/Capstone) and the proposed key escrow
Here's my $.02, as well.
In RISK 14.55,  Jim Bidzos wrote -

 Jim raises a valid concern. Although a hardware based system is
 ideal for voice encryption, the idea of registered key systems,
 where government and/or LE agencies have involvement, is not a
 popular one. The key escrow scheme in this proposal reeks of Big
 Brother. (As in, "Trust me. I'm from the government and I'm your
 friend.") In some circles, it is not even a consideration.
 Software encryption systems employed to protect intellectual and
 commercial data and electronic mail are much more flexible and
 desirable, especially when they are not governmentally proposed,
 imposed, designed and sanctioned by spook organizations such as
 the NSA.
 The real sore spot with the Clipper proposal is that private
 industry and citizenry were blind-sided by this entire process.
 The possibility that Uncle Sam will try to make this a de-facto
 standard and subsequently place restrictions on other forms of
 crypto (eg. software based) is real.
 Also in RISKS 14.55,  Bill Campbell
 wrotes -

 I have a tendency to agree with Bill. In fact, California is
 currently embroiled in a scandal involving the release of
 confidential data (DMV addresses), by employees of the Anaheim
 Police Department, to third party interests. This is clearly in
 violation of their employer's policies, their own terms of
 employment, state criminal law, and civil law. What's to
 stop the same blatant, unethical breech of confidentiality with
 regards to the Clipper key escrow implementation? Nothing, that's
 what. In the future, information will be the most powerful possession
 and in the spirit of SNEAKERS, s/he who has control of and access to
 the information is the most powerful. Power corrupts, but absolute
 power corrupts absolutely. I think that Clipper offers maximum abuse
 in this scenario.
 Also in RISK 14.55,  Robert Firth wrote -

 This is perhaps my greatest concern in all of the Clipper/Capstone
 hoopla. Personally, I don't have much faith in the law enforcment
 agencies to act responsibly. The Secret Service and FBI have, in the
 past, clearly demonstrated that do not grasp the scope of the
 problems technically challenging modern society. The Steve Jackson
 Games case is one instance that immediately springs to mind. Some
 parts of the country are demographically more at risk than others.
 For example, the criteria which may be deemed as "probable cause"
 for search and seizure in Jackson, Mississippi could very well be
 reason for the ACLU to file a suit against the LEA in New York City.

 The only way that I can imagine the government actually *needing*
 Clipper is where Clipper is forced upon the country as the de-facto
 standard and other forms of cryptography are restricted. Uncle Sam
 tends to forget that what is desirable for the government, is not
 always acceptable to the public at large.

@_subject: Big Brother, Rights to Privacy and Broadening Horizons? 
Greets, all.
After taking a few days off for the pomp and circumstance of my second
wedding (no, I'm not a polygamist -- I was divorced first)(genuine
thanks to all who sent your congratulations and best wishes), I finally
waded through all of the e-mail that had piled up in my "in-box" --
some 800 kb worth, no less.
Anyway, to the point --
This morning I was watching CBS's early, early morning news "Up to the
Minute" over a cup of Joe before heading to the airport. An interesting
spot came on that interested me very much, because of the correlation
to several law enforcement agencies' "loose cannon" style of persecution
which many of us have witnessed.
This particular report spotlighted the DEA's heavy-handed and
questionable practice of targeting legitimate gardening store
consumers under suspicion of growing marijuana. It just so happens
that the DEA had been watching several gardening supply stores which
sold hydroponic gardening equipment in some particular area of
California. (For those of you who are not familiar with Hydroponics,
it is a gardening method which uses water instead of soil. The plants
usually grow twice as fast when grown hydroponically and has become a
popular method of indoor gardening with marijuana enthusiasts.) In
fact, the DEA had gone as far as to place monitoring cameras in place
to record the identity of every customer or prospective consumer that
went in and out of these legitimate businesses, solely because of
their suspicions that some of the customers may be (gasp) growing
Additionally, a particular instance was cited where a gentleman went
into one of these gardening supply stores and bought a couple of lamps
for his aquarium. (This young, family-man had some coral in his
aquarium at home that he wanted to illuminate.) Later that evening,
agents from the DEA burst into his home while he and his family were
having dinner, saying that he was under suspicion of growing marijuana
and that "reliable witnesses" had tipped them off. After thoroughly
searching his home, they apologized and left.
Now -- you may ask yourself, "What in the hell does this have to do
with me? Or computers?" ("This is not my beautiful wife ....")
Well, this may be the same scenario, with the same LEA, but with a
different premise. Cryptography.
If the Clipper/Capstone implementation has a hidden agenda (I believe
it does), then tough restrictions on other "non-sanctioned" crypto
methods may not be far behind.
Personally, I don't have much of a problem imagining this, given the
recent escapades of the SPA (Rusty & Edie's), the Secret Service (SJG)
and all of our other beloved governmental law enforcement appartchiks.
In fact, I find it down-right disturbing that in many instances, this
is done without a warrant.
George Orwell is probably rolling over in his grave...

                            STATEMENT OF                           RAYMOND G. KAMMER
   ACTING DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY
                             BEFORE THE
           SUBCOMMITTEE ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND FINANCE
                  COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE
                           APRIL 29, 1993
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:
Good morning.  Thank you for inviting me to testify.  I am Raymond G.
Kammer, Acting Director of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology of the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Under the Computer
Security Act of 1987, NIST is responsible for the development of
standards for protecting unclassified government computer systems,
except those commonly known as Warner Amendment systems (as defined
in Title 10 USC 2315).  NIST has a long-established program of developing computer security
guidelines and standards for federal agencies.  Many of these are
also used, on a voluntary basis, by the private sector. We have
published guidance on computer security training and awareness,
identification and authentication, open systems security, incident
response, cryptographic standards, trusted systems, and many other
facets of computer security.   Today, however, I plan to address the following topics which I
believe are most directly germane to your invitation:
     *    The need for good information security technology to
          protect computer and telecommunications systems and
          networks;
     *    NIST's activities in telecommunications switch security;
     *    the planned recertification of the Data Encryption
          Standard;
     *    NIST's proposed Digital Signature Standard;
     *    the recent White House announcement of a new encryption
          technology, called the Clipper Chip; and
     *    the President's directive to review advanced
          telecommunications and encryption technology.
Need for Computer Security
Strong security technology is required in modern communications
systems and networks to protect sensitive and valuable information. Government agencies and private corporations depend upon the
integrity and availability of their communications system in order to
do business.  Computer viruses, network worms, hackers, and other
threats against our systems emphasize the importance of
telecommunications security.
Additionally, I have grown convinced, through strong anecdotal
evidence, most of it shared on a proprietary basis, of the growing
threat to American business from "economic espionage."  Much has been
reported in the press of the activities of foreign intelligence
services targeting American firms, and sharing their findings with
competing foreign firms.  I am convinced that American firms need
strong security, and in particular, strong cryptography, to protect
against such threats.  More importantly, the Administration is committed to working with the
private sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information. This infrastructure of high-speed networks ("information
superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and
huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits
voice.  Appropriate security techniques may at times be integrated
into such systems.  Telecommunications Security
Federal telephone and computer networks depend upon reliable and
secure telecommunications capabilities, both of long-distance
carriers and local private-branch exchanges (PBXs).  To examine
security issues of telecommunications networks, including issues of
PBX security and telecommunications switch security, NIST is
currently setting up a Telecommunications Security Analysis Center. This Center will expand on initial research we have conducted on the
vulnerability of telecommunications switches.
Telecommunications switches are an integral part of the security of
the public switched network.  Security problems in switches can
result in serious problems such as toll fraud, unauthorized and
illegal eavesdropping, or the disabling of switches, which would
result in bringing down part of the public switched network.
NIST has been monitoring the growth of switch-related abuse and has
been analyzing switches to be able to address the types of crimes
that could be perpetrated in the future.  This work includes studying
the growing ease of perpetrating these crimes.  There are several areas of concern:
     *    Toll fraud.  Current research indicates that the problem is
          well over $1 billion per year.  While not all toll-fraud is
          accomplished technically, telecommunications switches are
          vulnerable to hackers who can gain unauthorized access to
          the use of long-distance services.  This is a particular
          vulnerability to the owners of PBXs, who can lose
          considerable sums if their systems are inadequately
          protected.  Good system configuration control is one good
          security measure we are examining.       *    Network Availability.  There have been no cases of
          intruders purposefully bringing down parts of the public
          switched network.  The President's National Security
          Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) concluded
          that "Until there is confidence that strong comprehensive
          computer security programs are in place, the industry
          should assume that a motivated and resourceful adversary in
          one concerted manipulation of the network software could
          degrade at least portions of the PSN."
     *    Unauthorized Eavesdropping.  If unauthorized access is
          gained to telecommunications switches, which is really just
          a computer that switches phone calls, a hacker can gain
          access to the contents of phone conversations and other
          information transmitted through a switch.  This
          unauthorized eavesdropping can be either "real-time," as
          the conversations occur, or the intruders can arrange to
          have the conversations and data electronically transmitted
          to another telecommunications switch or computer for later
          analysis.
The purpose of the Telecommunications Security Analysis Center will
be to:
     *    Develop tools and techniques to analyze very complex
          systems such as switches;
     *    Provide informal security guidance and advice to federal
          agencies on procurement of telecommunications switches;      *    Perform security analyses of commercial switches in both
          laboratory and real world environments; and
     *    Develop standards and guidance for use in securing switches
          and in building more secure switches, while providing for
          the legitimate needs of law enforcement, under proper court
          order, to protect the American public.
As we pursue this research, we will be pleased to provide additional
information on our findings to the Committee.  The Data Encryption Standard
The current government standard for the encryption of data is known
as the Data Encryption Standard (DES), which was first approved as a
Federal Information Processing Standard in 1977.  DES is widely used
within both the government and the private sector for the protection
of sensitive information, including financial information, medical
information, and Privacy Act data.  DES represents a proven twenty
year old technology with DES products available in the marketplace
for the last 15 years.  Last year, NIST formally solicited comments on the recertification of
DES.  After reviewing those comments, and the other technical inputs
that I have received, I plan to recommend to the Secretary of
Commerce that he recertify DES for another five years.  I also plan
to suggest to the Secretary that when we announce the recertification
we state our intention to consider alternatives to it over the next
five years.  By putting that announcement on the table, we hope to
give people an opportunity to comment on orderly technological
transitions.  In the meantime, we need to consider the large
installed base of systems that rely upon this proven standard.  NIST's Proposed Digital Signature Standard
The majority of the cryptographic-based security requirements in
computer and network systems involve the need for strong
identification and authentication.  One method which we believe holds
a capacity for significant improvements in security and also cost-
savings by automating paper processes is the use of digital
signatures.  A digital signature is a computer-based method of "sealing" an
electronic message in such a way that its contents cannot be changed
or forged without detection and that the identity of the originator
of the communication can be verified.  The digital signature for a
message is simply a code, or large number, that is unique for each
message and each message originator (within a very high, known
probability).  A digital signature is computed for a message by
computing a representation of the message (called a "hash" code) and
a cryptographic process that uses a key associated with the message
originator.  Any party with access to the public key, message, and
signature can verify the signature.  If the signature verifies
correctly, the receiver (or any other party) has confidence that the
message was signed by the owner of the public key and the message has
not been altered after it was signed.  In 1991, NIST proposed a draft Digital Signature Standard (DSS).  We
received about 130 public comments.  We have been reviewing these
comments and revising the standard as appropriate to respond to those
comments.  Additionally, we have examined and are currently dealing
with two claims of patent infringement, which we believe will be
successfully resolved in the not-too-distant future.  Once this
occurs, the Secretary of Commerce needs to decide to approve the DSS
as a Federal Information Processing Standard.  It will then
complement the Secure Hash Standard which was recently approved by
the Secretary of Commerce as Federal Information Processing Standard
180.  We anticipate that the DSS will find many uses within government
computer systems and networks.  For example, DSS could be employed in
electronic funds transfer systems.  Suppose an electronic funds
transfer message is generated to request that $100.00 be transferred
from one account to another. If the message was passed over an
unprotected network, it may be possible for an adversary to alter the
message and request a transfer of $1000.00.  Without additional
information, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the
receiver to know the message had been altered.  However if the DSS
was used to sign the message before it was sent, the receiver would
know the message had been altered because it would not verify
correctly.  The transfer request could then be denied.
DSS could be employed in a variety of business applications requiring
a replacement of handwritten signatures.  One example is Electronic
Data Interchange (EDI).  EDI is the computer-to-computer interchange
of messages representing business documents.  In the federal
government, this technology is being used to procure goods and
services.  Digital signatures could be used to replace handwritten
signatures in these EDI transactions.  For instance, contracts
between the government and its vendors could be negotiated
electronically.  A government procurement official could post an
electronically signed message requesting bids for office supplies. Vendors wishing to respond to the request may first verify the
message before they respond.  This assures that the contents of the
message have not been altered and that the request was signed by a
legitimate procurement official.  After verifying the bid request,
the vendor could generate and sign an electronic bid.  Upon receiving
the bid, the procurement official could verify that the vendor's bid
was not altered after it was signed.  If the bid is accepted, the
electronic message could be passed to a contracting office to
negotiate the final terms of the contract.  The final contract could
be digitally signed by both the contracting office and the vendor. If a dispute arose at some later time, the contents of contract and
the associated signatures could be verified by a third party. DSS is also likely to find widespread applications in the health care
field.  It might be used to sign digital images, for example, to
assure that they remain safe against unauthorized modifications.
DSS could also be useful in the distribution of software.  A digital
signature could be applied to software after it has been validated
and approved for distribution.  Before installing the software on a
computer, the signature could be verified to be sure no unauthorized
changes (such as the addition of a virus) have been made.  The
digital signature could be verified periodically to ensure the
integrity of the software.  In database applications, the integrity of information stored in the
database is often essential.  DSS could be employed in a variety of
database applications to provide integrity.  For example, information
could be signed when it was entered into the database.  To maintain
integrity, the system could also require that all updates or
modifications to the information be signed.  Before signed
information was viewed by a user, the signature could be verified. If the signature verified correctly, the user would know the
information was not altered by an unauthorized party.  The system
could also include signatures in the audit information to provide a
record of users who modified the information.    The DSS can also be used in conjunction with more secure
identification and authentication systems, for the protection of
access to both computer and telecommunication systems. A New Encryption Technology:  The Clipper Chip
Approximately two weeks ago, the White House announced our intention,
based on a new encryption technology, the Clipper Chip, to initiate a
voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement. This initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links - the
security of the very systems you are examining here today.
Sophisticated encryption technology, including the DES, has been used
for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used
to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by
terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.
A state-of-the-art microcircuit, the "Clipper Chip," has been
developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new
approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively
inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary
telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption
algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today. The Clipper algorithm with an 80 bit long cryptographic key is
approximately 16 million times stronger than DES.  It would take a
CRAY YMP over 200 years to solve one DES key.  It would take the same
machine over a billion years to solve one Clipper Chip key.
This new technology offers opportunities for companies to protect
proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone
conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   Protection of confidentiality of information is of critical concern
to the nation.  So too is the ability of law enforcement to provide
safe streets and neighborhoods.  Americans demand the very best in
law enforcement - at the federal, state and local level.  Citizens
insist upon a quick response to terrorist threats, organized crime,
and drug dealers, while preserving our Constitutional rights.  Past
experience clearly shows that one critical technology successfully
used to prosecute organized crime is the use of court-authorized
wiretaps.  Unquestionably, these lawful electronic intercepts have
saved lives and been critical to bringing criminals to justice.  The
"Clipper Chip" is also a powerful tool which will be used by law
enforcement to protect its own sensitive communications from illicit
criminal monitoring.
A "key-escrow" system is envisioned that would ensure that the
"Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique
"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies
to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is
manufactured, the two keys would be deposited separately in two "key-
escrow" data bases established by the Attorney General.  Access to
these keys would be limited to government officials with legal
authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The President has asked the Attorney General to make arrangements
with appropriate entities who would hold the keys for the key-escrow
microcircuits installed in communications equipment.  I understand
that the Attorney General is currently studying these procedures and
options for who will serve as the key escrow holders.  Since the announcement from the White House, I have stressed that the
"Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no new
authorities to access the content of the private conversations of
Americans.  Also, some have claimed that there is a hidden trapdoor
in the chip or the algorithm.  I cannot state it more simply: no
trapdoor exists.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals
and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and other approaches that
can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption
they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal
activities.  Presidential Directive for Advanced Telecommunications and Encryption
In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches and
technologies (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed
government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption
and advanced telecommunications technology that accommodates:
     *    the privacy of our citizens, including the need to employ
          voice or data encryption for business purposes;
     *    the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data, under proper court or other legal order,
          when necessary to protect our citizens;
     *    the effective and timely use of the most modern technology
          to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to
          promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American
          industry in the global marketplace; and      *    the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high
          technology products.
The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.
I anticipate being a member of the governmental review panel which
will study this issue.
I will again stress what we have stated previously.  Encryption
technology will play an increasingly important role in future network
infrastructures and the Federal Government must act quickly to
develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The
Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans'
right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the

@_subject: Additional amendments to the ECPA? 
Doing some research on existing laws and ran across this snippet
concerning the ECPA and amendments made in 1986-87. Can someone with
more legalese comment on whether this has again been amended or
changed? How does this relate to LEA's selectively wiretapping
private e-mail and other electronic communications? Or does it?
8<----- Begain forwarded text ------------
     On October 21, 1986, President Reagan signed the new Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 amending the federal wiretap law.
ECPA went into effect during the beginning of 1987.  (P.L.  99-508,
Title I, sec. 111, 100 Stat. 1859; P.L. 99-508, Title II, sec. 202,
100 Stat. 1868.)  ECPA created parallel privacy protection against
both interception of electronic communications while in transmission
and unauthorized access to electronic communications stored on a system.
     The new ECPA first provides privacy protection for any      'electronic communication' ... [by] any transfer of signs,      signals, writing, images, sounds, data or intelligence of any      nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio,      electromagnetic, photoelectronic or photooptical system that      affects interstate or foreign commerce...."  (18 U.S.C. secs. 2510(12), 2511.)  The Senate Report noted examples of electronic communications to include non-voice communications such as "electronic mail, digitized transmissions, and video teleconferences."
(S. Rep. No. 541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 14 reprinted_in 1986 U.S. Code
Cong. & Ad. News 3568.)  Electronic communication is defined in terms of
how it is transmitted.  So long as the means by which a communication is
transmitted affects interstate or foreign commerce, the communication is
covered ECPA. (18 U.S.C. sec. 2510(12).)  Generally, that would include
all telephonic means including private networks and intra-company
communications.  (S. Rep. No. 541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 12 reprinted_in
1986 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 3566.)
     Second, ECPA protects the electronic communication when it has been stored after transmission, such as e-mail left on an electronic computer communication system for later pickup by its intended recipient.  (18
U.S.C. sec. 2510(17).)  The legislation makes it a federal criminal
offense to break into any electronic system holding private
communications or to exceed authorized access to alter or obtain the
stored communications. (18 U.S.C. sec. 2701(a).)
     The legislation would protect electronic computer communication
systems from law enforcement invasion of user e-mail without a court
order.  (18 U.S.C. secs. 2517, 2518, 2703.)  Although the burden of
preventing disclosure of the e-mail is placed on the subscriber or
user of the system, the government must give him fourteen days
notice to allow him to file a motion to quash a subpoena or to vacate
a court order seeking disclosure of his computer material.  (18 U.S.C.
sec. 2704(b).)  However, the government may give delayed notice where
there are exigent circumstances as listed by the Act (18 U.S.C. sec.
2705.)  Recognizing the easy user destruction of computer data, ECPA
allows the government to include in its subpoena or court order the
requirement that the provider or operator retain a backup copy of
electronic communications when there is risk of user destruction.
(18 U.S.C. sec. 2704(a).)
     The legislation gives a civil cause of action to the provider or operator, subscriber, customer or user of the system aggrieved by an invasion of an electronic communication in the system in violation of
the ECPA.  (18 U.S.C. secs. 2520, 2707.)  If the provider or operator
has to disclose information stored on his system due to a court order,
warrant, subpoena, or certification under ECPA, no cause of action can
be brought against him by the person aggrieved by such disclosure.
(18 U.S.C. sec. 2703(e); see_also 18 U.S.C. secs. 2701(c), 2702(b),
2511(2)(a)(i), 2511(3)(b)(iii) where the systems operator or provider
is not held criminally liable, may observe a private communication
while performing employment duties or according to authorization,
etc., may intercept private communication while making quality
control checks or during the course of forwarding communications to
another system.)

I recently became aware of an article that you wrote entitled,
"Notes on Cryptography, Diigital Telephony, and the Bill of
Rights", which was included in a recent CuD (5.32, Sun May 2,
1993). It appeared to be a message you had originally posted to
the austin.eff newsgroup.
I'm not so sure that it ever made it over to cypherpunks, so I'm
quoting part of that message here for clarity.
You wrote -
     "B.  The Fourth Amendment reads: "The right of the people to be
secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no
Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or
affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched,
and the persons or things to be seized."
      C.  Conspicuously missing from the language of this amendment is
any guarantee that the government, with properly obtained warrant in
hand, will be _successful_ in finding the right place to be searched or
persons or things to be seized. What the Fourth Amendment is about is
_obtaining warrants_--similarly, what the wiretap statutes are about
is _obtaining authorization_ for wiretaps and other interceptions.
Neither the Fourth Amendment nor Title III nor the other protections
of the ECPA constitute an law-enforcement _entitlement_ for law
      D.  It follows, then, that if digital telephony or widespread
encryption were to create new burdens for law enforcement, this would
not, as some law-enforcement representatives have argued, constitute an
"effective repeal" of Title III. What it would constitute is a change
in the environment in which law enforcement, along with the rest of us,
has to work. Technology often creates changes in our social environment
--some, such as the original innovation of the wiretap, may aid law
enforcement, while others, such as powerful public-key cryptography,
pose the risk of inhibiting law enforcement. Historically, law
enforcement has responded to technological change by adapting.
(Indeed, the original wiretaps were an adaptation to the widespread
use of the telephone.) Does it make sense for law enforcement suddenly
to be able to require that the rest of society adapt to its perceived

Big Brother and the Computer Age
By John Markoff
Can the nation trust its secrets to its spies?
That question  underpins a fierce debate over a recently
disclosed plan by the Clinton Administration to secure the
privacy of the nation's phone calls and computer data with a
standard set of computer codes.
The system was designed by scientists from the United States'
most secretive intelligence organization, the National Security
Agency. And newly disclosed memorandums, obtained under a legally
enforceable request under the Freedom of Information Act, show
that the agency waged a long and ultimately successful campaign
within the Government to insure that the technical details of
such a system would remain secret.
The inner workings of the system would be in tamper-proof
computer chips that could not be opened without being destroyed.
That means that citizens and businesses could use the encoding
technique to protect the privacy of their wireless phone calls or
the transmissions of corporate computer files, but that
independent computer experts would have no way to assure that the
system was secure enough to keep savvy computer hackers from
unscrambling messages. Nor, some computer experts say, can
anyone be certain that the National Security Agency has not built
in a "trap door" that could allow unauthorized Government
"This plan creates the ears of Big Brother, just as Orwell
warned," said Eric Hughes, an independent software designer in
Berkeley, Calif.
Over the years, the N.S.A. has been the Government's
communications policeman, with the job of protecting the
sensitive telephone and computer networks used  by the military,
the State Department and other Federal agencies. It also operates
a world-wide electronic-surveillance system, monitoring foreign
communications in the name of national security.
But the recently announced encoding plan would give the agency an
unprecedented role in domestic civilian corporate communications.
"The N.S.A. is split between the need to provide security and the
fear that if information about cryptography gets out, it won't be
able to perform its other job, which is intercepting and
resolving codes." said David Kahn, author of "The Codebreakers,"
a history of the science of encryption. "It's an unresolvable
The Clinton Administration inherited the new project from the
Bush Administration, and has embraced it. The goal is a national
voice- and data-security standard intended to provide privacy for
Government, civilian and corporate users of telephone and
computer communications, while also assuring that law enforcement
agencies can continue to eavesdrop on or wiretap voice and data
conversations after obtaining warrants.
For authorized wiretapping, the law enforcement agency must
obtain special code keys held in escrow by two independent
organizations. What computer experts fear is a secret trap door
that would not require use of these legally obtained keys.
Custodian of Security
The agency has a long history of resisting industry efforts to
develop such technology on the ground that any codes not
breakable by the N.S.A. might compromise national security.
But people like John Gage, director of the science office at Sun
Microsystems in Mountain View, Calif., the maker of high-powered
computer work stations, are uncomfortable with that line of
reasoning. "These decisions can't be left solely to the gods of
encryption, the N.S.A.," Mr. Gage said. "We need privacy for the
world of business."
He testified last week at a hearing by the House Commerce
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, which is studying
computer encryption and the National Security Agency's role in
Concerns about the agency's influence on civilian communications
have been raised before. Last year, for instance, a number of
cellular-telephone executives said that an industry standards
committee had been pressed by N.S.A. officials to weaken the
security of a coding scheme that cellular phone makers are
planning to build into the next generation of phones.
Although the agency denied the assertion, computer researchers
who analyzed the industry committee's cellular coding scheme say
that it would be simple to subvert by anyone with computer-
programming skills.
Written Response
With the new plan, N.S.A. officials insist that they have no
motive to undermine the security of the coding plan, which was
originally developed to protect Government information.
The agency routinely refuses requests for on-the-record
interviews, but the agency's director of policy, Michael A.
Smith, responded in writing to a reporter's questions.
"N.S.A. states unequivocally there is no trap door built into the
algorithm." he wrote, referring to the mathematical instructions
on which the encoding system is based. "A trap door would be a
vulnerability in the system, and would defeat the purpose of
assuring the system provides U.S. citizens with excellent
In resisting the N.S.A.'s effort to impose a secret standard,
communications and computer-industry executives point out that
various unofficial coding systems are already in use in this
country and abroad, whether for legitimate purposes or to conceal
criminal conspiracies.
Among those criticizing the agency's effort to keep a lid on
encryption is Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of
Massachusetts, chairman of the House telecommunications
What Power Do opponents Have?
"There are many ways the N.S.A. is trying to put the
cryptography genie back in the bottle, but it's already available
for everyone openly," said Mr. Markey, who plans to conduct
further hearings on the agency's role in the new system. The
Clinton Administration plans to hold its own private review in
coming months to study the nation's cryptography policies and
consider public comment.
It is not yet clear whether mounting controversy over the
National Security Agency's role could derail the plan.
The new technology is the result of the Computer Security Act of
1987. It called for creation of a national standard for computer
encryption and assigned the task to the main Federal
standards-setting body, now known as the National Institute for
Standards and Technology.
A 1989 memo by a technical working group from the institute
detailed the goal for an encryption standard that would be open
to public use and scrutiny. "The algorithms that we use must be
public, unclassified implementable in both hardware or software,
usable by Federal agencies and U.S.-based multinational
corporations," the memo reads in part.
The institute turned to the N.S.A. for technical assistance.
"The act says we can draw on N.S.A.," said Raymond Kammer, who
was at the institute at the time and is now deputy director.
"They're the pre-eminent scientists in cryptography in the world.
We asked the agency to design a technology to fit the needs of
the civilian community."
Memos Detail Opposition
But previously classified Government memos, obtained last week
through a Freedom of information filing by Computer Professional
for Social Responsibility, a public-interest group, indicate that
the agency used the process of technical working groups to wear
down opposition by institute scientists who wanted to keep the
standard open to scrutiny.
A January 1990 memo by a National Institute scientist to a
colleague expressed frustration. Referring to his own group by
its acronym, he wrote, "It is increasingly evident that it is
difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the concerns of
N.S.A., N.I.S.T. and the general public using this approach."
The N.S.A. also largely ignored the public advisory group that
Congress mandated in the 1987 law. That group, composed of
industry and Government computer experts, plans a public hearing
meeting next month to put forth its concerns.
"This all happened within the N.S.A.," said a member of the
advisory group, Stephen Walker, president of Trusted Information
Systems, a computer security company in Glenwood, Md. "Then it
was brought forward as an accomplished fact. This doesn't solve
any of our problems relative to getting good cryptography for the
American people."
The new coding system, if adopted, would first be used for
Government electronic communications. It is then expected to
quickly spread to business and even to household use, as
hardware and software makers incorporate the technology into
their products.
Export Process Is Slow
Various types of encryption systems are in use today, but the
standard approach in the United States is a 15-year-old system
known as the Data Encryption Standard. Based on outdated
technology, this system is not the best available for modern
electronic commerce. And the Government has refused to authorize
export of hardware and software containing it, except on a
time-consuming case-by-case basis.
The Clinton Administration is studying whether to allow the
general export of products based on the new N.S.A.-designed
coding system, although industry executives say they doubt that
foreign buyers, especially foreign Governments, would want to use
codes designed by American spy masters.
When Congress passed the Computer Security Act, it recognized the
need to update privacy laws and wiretapping regulations to modern
digital communication, which, particularly in the case of
cellular phone calls and other emerging forms of over-the-air
technology, can be easily monitored either by those authorized
to do so,  or those who are not.
To demonstrate just how easy unauthorized use might be, Mr. Gage,
the Sun Microsystems executive, brought a computer hacker with
him to the recent House hearing.
Punching a special code into a standard cellular phone, the
hacker quickly converted the phone into a scanner capable of
eavesdropping on all the cellular channels being used on or near
Capitol Hill. The intercepted snatches of innocuous conversation
were amplified to the amusement and discomfort of those in the
subcommittee hearing room -- including a woman in the audience
who had her own cellular phone at her side.
"This demonstration," Mr. Gage said, "shows it's not really safe
to talk on the phone."

 Mr. Tien,
 I have bothered Mike Godwin and Shari Steele to the point of no
 return in legalese. (Blame them for pointing me in your direction.)
 Actually, I'm quite curious of the ITAR restrictions of cryptologic
 software/hardware legislation currently on the books and the chances
 of it being scaled back in light of the current "Clipper" fiasco. I'm
 well aware of the legal provisions within USC Title 18, and the ECPA
 but have no idea of additional transcripts that exist that the Dept.
 of State which have been circumscribed to regulate and tariff.
 Would you be so kind as to enlighten me (us) of the ITAR stuff that
 many of us have heard so much about? I know Phil Zimmerman has made
 limited mention of ITAR restrictions, so I think that we need to
 first lift the veil of ignorance.
 Thanks for your anticipated response.

In  Marc Rotenberg
Mr. Rotenberg, as a public figure operating in the political arena,
has to exercise a certain diplomatic restraint in responding to Ms.
Denning's claims. I am, thankfully, under no such requirement.
As a long-time RISKS reader and contributor, I observe that that this
is not the first time that Ms. Denning has apparently operated as a
mouthpiece for the NSA's anti-privacy party line on DES and related
I believe Ms. Denning's remarks must be understood as part of a
continuing propaganda campaign to marginalize and demonize advocates
of electronic privacy rights.  Other facets of this campaign have
attempted to link privacy advocates to terrorists and drug dealers
by suggesting that only criminals need fear wiretapping.
These are serious charges.  I make them because, in the wake of the
Clipper proposal, I do not believe civil libertarians can afford any
longer to assume that their opponents are persons of good will with
whom they can simply debate minor differences of institutional means
in a collegial way.
It's time for someone to say, in public and on this list, what I know
many of us have been thinking.  The future is *now*.  Electronic
privacy issues are no longer a parlor game for futurologists; they are
the focus of a critical political struggle, *and the opponents of
privacy are fighting their war with all the tools of force, deception,
and propaganda they can command*.
The histories of the DES, the FBI wiretap proposal, and now the Clipper
proposal must be considered against a wider background of abuses
including the Steve Jackson case, "Operation Longarm", and the routine
tapping of U.S. domestic telecommunications by NSA interception stations
located outside the geographic borders of the United States.
These form a continuing pattern of attempts by agencies of the U.S.
government to pre-empt efforts to extend First and Fourth Amendment
privacy protections to the new electronic media.  In each case, the
attempt was made to present civil libertarians with a fait accompli,
invoking "national security" (or the nastiness of "kiddie porn") to
justify legislative, judicial and practical precedents prejudicial
against electronic privacy rights.
While I would not go so far as to claim that these efforts are
masterminded by a unitary conspiracy, I believe that the interlocking
groups of spies, bureaucrats and lawmen who have originated them
recognize each other as cooperating fellow-travelers in much the
same way as opposing groups like the EFF, CPSR and the Cypherpunks
do.  Their implicit agenda is to make the new electronic
communications media transparent to government surveillance and
(eventually) pliant to government control.
One of the traits of this culture of control is the belief that
manipulative lying and dissemblage can be justified for a `higher
I believe that Ms. Denning's disingenuous claim that the DSS "is now
considered to be just as strong as RSA" is no mere technical
misapprehension. I believe it is propaganda aimed at making objectors
non-persons in the debate.  I cannot know whether Ms. Denning
actually believes this claim, but it reminds me all too strongly
of the classic "Big Lie" technique.
It is important for us to recognize that the propaganda lie is not an
aberration, but a routine tool of the authoritarian mindset.  And the
authoritarian mindset is, ultimately, what we are confronting here
--- the mindset that regards the fighting of elastically-defined
`crime' as more important than privacy, that presumes guilt until
innocence is proven, that demands for government a license to override
any individual's natural rights at political whim.
We cannot trust representatives of an institutional culture that was
*constructed* to deal in information control, lies, secrecy, paranoia
and deception to tell us the truth.
We cannot accept the authoritarians' unverified assurances that the
sealed interior of the Clipper chip contains no `trapdoor' enabling
the NSA to eavesdrop at will.
We cannot trust the authoritarians' assertions that they have no
intention of outlawing cryptographic technologies potentially more
secure than the Clipper chip.
We cannot believe the authoritarians' claims that `independent' key
registries will prevent abuse of decryption keys by government and/or
corrupt individuals.
We cannot --- we *must not* --- cede control of encryption technology
to the authoritarians.  To do so would betray our children and their
descendants, who will work and *live* in cyberspace to an extent we
can barely imagine.
We cannot any longer afford the luxury of treating the authoritarians
as honest dealers with whom compromise is morally advisable, or even
possible.  Whatever their own valuation of themselves, the
thinly-veiled power grab represented by the Clipper proposal reveals
a desire to institutionalize means which a free society, wishing to
remain free, *cannot tolerate*.
Big Brother must be stopped *here*.  *Now.*  While it is still possible.

This is an interesting extract that I came across this morning.
I thought that I'd post  a portion of it (the entire paper is almost
900 lines) to the group since the topic of TEMPEST had surfaced -

        walls of world freedom.[1]
                                      -President John F.
                                           Kennedy
   _____________________
   1.  Undelivered  speech  of  President  John  F.  Kennedy,
   Dallas  Citizens Council (Nov. 22, 1963) 35-36.
             In the novel 1984, George Orwell foretold a future
   where individuals had no expectation  of privacy because the
   state monopolized the technology of  spying.  The government
   watched the actions of its subjects from birth to death.  No
   one could protect himself because  surveillance and counter-
   surveillance technology was controlled by the government.
        This note explores  the legal status of  a surveillance
   technology  ruefully  known  as  TEMPEST[2].    Using  TEMPEST
   technology  the  information in  any  digital device  may be
   intercepted  and  reconstructed  into   useful  intelligence
   without the  operative ever having to come  near his target.
   The technology is  especially useful in the  interception of
   information  stored  in  digital computers  or  displayed on
   computer terminals.
        The use of TEMPEST is not illegal under the laws of the
   United  States[3],  or  England.    Canada has  specific  laws
   criminalizing TEMPEST eavesdropping but the  laws do more to
   hinder surveillance countermeasures than to prevent  TEMPEST
   surveillance.  In  the United  States it is  illegal for  an
   individual  to  take   effective  counter-measures   against
   TEMPEST surveillance.  This  leads to the conundrum that  it
   is legal  for individuals and  the government to  invade the
   privacy of others but illegal for  individuals to take steps
   to protect their privacy.
        The author would  like to suggest that the  solution to
   this   conundrum   is  straightforward.      Information  on
   _____________________
   2.  TEMPEST  is an  acronym for  Transient Electromagnetic  Pulse
   Emanation Standard.   This standard sets forth the official views
   of the United  States on the amount  of electromagnetic radiation
   that a device may emit without compromising the information it is
   processing.   TEMPEST  is  a defensive  standard; a  device which
   conforms to this standard is referred to as TEMPEST Certified.
        The United States  government has refused to  declassify the
   acronym  for  devices  used   to  intercept  the  electromagnetic
   information of  non-TEMPEST Certified  devices.   For this  note,
   these  devices  and  the  technology  behind  them  will  also be
   referred  to as  TEMPEST;  in  which  case,  TEMPEST  stands  for
   Transient Electromagnetic Pulse Surveillance Technology.
        The  United  States  government refuses  to  release details
   regarding TEMPEST and continues an organized effort to censor the
   dissemination of  information  about it.    For example  the  NSA
   succeeded in shutting  down a  Wang Laboratories presentation  on
   TEMPEST Certified equipment  by classifying  the contents of  the
   speech and threatening  to prosecute  the speaker with  revealing
   classified information.  [cite coming].
   3.  This  Note  will not  discuses  how  TEMPEST relates  to  the
   Warrant Requirement under  the United  States Constitution.   Nor
   will it discuss the Constitutional exclusion of foreign nationals
   from the Warrant Requirement.
   protecting  privacy  under  TEMPEST should  be  made  freely
   available;  TEMPEST  Certified equipment  should  be legally
   available; and organizations possessing  private information
   should  be  required  by  law  to protect  that  information
   through  good  computer security  practices  and the  use of
   TEMPEST Certified equipment.

 I beg your pardon, but this is _not_ the case. TEMPEST requirements
 are _not_ classified and are available for public scrutiny. (You
 obviously do not know where to look.) I _know_ this to be true: I
 working in the COMSEC arena within the US military for the better
 part of five years. In fact, I helped design and construct the first
 tactically-based, X.25 packet switched, PC based, uHF interfaced
 network in Europe back in the early '80's using  Zenith Z-248's and
 KG-84's. We did everything from designing the cabling pin-out's on
 up.
 You're trying to separate issues that are one and the same. With the
 proper equipment, I can put you and an IBM Selectric (tm) typewriter
 on a wooden raft in the middle of Lake Superior, monitor and realize
 every keystroke that you make and you'd not be the wiser. This type
 of monitoring is easily defeated by low yield TEMPEST requirements.
 I've worked in this area, Bill, and have tested these _facts_. I
 don't care how you care to word it, it _is_ transient
 electromagnetic emissions.
 As I stated above (and I place myself in jeopardy of being accosted
 by Big Brother by admitting it), I was a COMSEC flunky during my
 junket with the US Army. Originally, I was a 31S(ierra) and later a
 29S(ierra) when two MOS's (Military Occupational Specialties, in Army
 jargon) were later merged. I was also a COMSEC Custodian (alternate,
 actually) and I can admit that I have a deep understanding of
 cryptographic key systems, cryptographic theory, cryptographic
 hardware design and integration and "BLACK" and "RED" separation
 principles. This type of technology does not require a rocket
 scientist (trust me, I've worked with them too at NASA)(oh yeah, I
 forgot -- I've also done contract work for Bell Labs and AT&T Secure
 Systems).
 This issue is one where I must disagree with you emphatically. The
 majority of the American public don't even know about Clipper. Hell,
 most of them think those AT&T commercials (Aretha singing "Freedom")
 are cute. Personally, I think its pretty sick, considering how they
 worked in collusion with Big Brother (No Such Agency) and announce
 that they would be immediately using this "technology" on the same
 day that the NIST made its announcement that Clipper would be the
 "weapon of choice" in their war on drugs, would-be criminals and the
 American public (April 16, 1993).
 I know the technical specifics of TEMPEST (it is an acronym, BTW) and
 the reason it was developed as a SIGINT (SIGnal INTelligence) standard.
 Cheers.

SAMPLE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL LETTER
RE:  Request number [Add this if the agency has given your request a number]
     This is an appeal pursuant to subsection (a)(6) of the Freedom of Information Act as amended (5U.S.C. 552).
     On [date], I received a letter from [name of official] of your agency denying my request for [describe briefly the information you are after]. This reply indicated that an appeal letter could be sent to you. I am enclosing a copy of my exchange of correspondence with your agency so that you can see exactly what files I have requested and the insubstantial grounds on which my request has been denied.
     [Optional paragraph, to be used if the agency has withheld all or nearly all the material which has been requested]:
     You will note that your agency has withheld the entire (or nearly the entire) document (or file, or report, or whatever) that I requested. Since the FOIA provides that "any reasonably secregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt," I believe that your agency has not complied with the FOIA. I believe that there must be (additional) secregable portions which do not fall within FOIA exemptions and which must be released.
     [Optional paragraph, to be used in the agency has used the (b)(1) exemption for national security, to withhold information]
     Your agency has used the (b)(1) exemption to withhold information [I question whether files relating to events that took place over twenty years ago could realistically harm the national security.] [Because I am familiar with my own activities during the period in question, and know that none of these activities in any way posed a significant threat to the national security, I question the designation of my files or portions of my file as classified and exempt from disclosure because of
national security considerations.]
     [Sample optional argument to be used if the exemption which is claimed does not seem to make sense; you should cite as many specific instances as you care to of items withheld from the documents that you have received. We provide two examples which you might want to adapt to your own case.]
     "On the memo dated _____________ the second paragraph withheld under the (b)(1) exemption appears to be describing a conversation at an open meeting. If this is the case, it is impossible that the substance of this conversation could be properly classified." Or, "The memo dated _____ refers to a meeting which I attended, but a substantial portion is deleted because of the (b)(6) and (b)(7)(c) exemptions for unwarranted invasions of personal privacy. Since I already know who attended this meeting, no privacy interest is served by the withholding."
     I trust that upon examination of my request, you will conclude that the records I requested are not properly covered by exemption(s) [here repeat the exemptions which the agency's denial letter claimed applied to your request] of the amended FOIA, and that you will overrule the decision to withhold the      [Use if an itemized inventory is not supplied originally]
     If you choose instead to continue to withhold some or all of the material which was denied in my initial request to your agency, I ask that you give me an index of such material, together with the justification for the denial of each item which is still withheld.
     As provided in the Act, I will expect to receive a reply to this administrative appeal letter within twenty working days.
     If you deny this appeal and do not adequately explain why the material withheld is properly exempt, I intend to initial a lawsuit to compel its disclosure. [You can say that you intend to sue, if that is your present inclination; you may still decide ultimately not to file suit.]
Sincerely yours,

Title:     Hackers switch sides, offer security package. (includes
           related article on the VinCrypt data security application)
           (Product Announcement)
Author:    Daly, James
Abstract:  Notorious computer hackers introduce their $159 VinCrypt
           encryption package, which enhances data security.  The
           DOS-based application has been created by highly skilled
           underground systems programmers.  Co-developer Ian Murphy,
           who is president of Secure Data Systems Inc, also will
           distribute the application.  He indicates that VinCrypt
           has not gained the approval of any government agency, but
           he does not seek government approval.  Murphy believes that
           data encryption packages based on the Data Encryption
           Standard or RSA Data Security Inc's standards are not secure
           because their basic algorithms have been given to the
           National Security Agency. VinCrypt's source code will not
           be passed around, but some experts suggest that it then will
           be difficult to evaluate the package's real security
           effectiveness.

I remember reading this in the March ACM and thinking,"Man. He hit
that right on the head." When I ran across this transcript in Computer
Select earlier this morning (while looking for various encryption
products, no less), I thought those of you who had not already seen it
would be struck by John Perry's insights. BTW, I also have the full
transcripts of Dorothy Denning's, William A. Bayse's (Assistant
Director, FBI Technical Services Division) and Lewis M. Branscomb's
(Harvard University) articles which appeared in the same issue with
regards to Digital Telephony, if anyone cares for me to post them.
Looking back on the progression of events, beginning with the debate
of the Digital Telephony proposal and subsequently the proposal
currently (officially) referred to as the "Key Escrow" Chip (and its
associated escrow scheme), I can't help but surmise that the whole
ball of wax is geared towards allowing the Government the ability to
effectively eavesdrop on its citizens communications in the face of
advancing technology, without regard to privacy matters.

CHIPPING AWAY AT PRIVACY?
Encryption Device Widens Debate Over Rights of U.S. to Eavesdrop
by John Mintz and John Schwartz
Washington Post Staff Writers
The two men were well-dressed, Bill Frezza recalls. They walked
into his New Jersey office a few days after his company,
Ericsson-G.E. Mobile Data, Inc., announced the introduction of a
portable device for sending and receiving electronic messages.
The two asked knowledgeable questions about whether the product
incorporated "encryption" technology, which scrambles signals to
frustrate eavesdroppers.
They wanted to buy some of the expensive, high-tech devices. With
"They were not tekkies," concluded Frezza, the firm's marketing
chief. By the time they left (empty-handed, since there were no
devices to sell yet), Frezza had decided they were drug dealers.
The New Jersey incident illustrates why law enforcement and
intelligence agencies are working so hard to keep a finger on new
communications technologies emerging around the world. They fear
these advances will give criminals and terrorists a new advantage

 Very lucid and wise observation. I have suggested several times that
 attention should also be directed to the (what I call) "potential
 factor" in regards to the entire "key escrow" system. The potential
 for abuse and unconstitutional invasions of personal privacy are ripe
 for the picking under this scheme. In my own public comment letter to
 the Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board, I stressed
 this fact and also pointed out that although the system was probably
 designed with good intentions (right), it will not prevent zealots
 and spooks from monitoring communications under certain
 circumstances.
 My other peeve is that after this "technology" has been entrenched
 (read: forced) on the public, I see the rug being pulled out from
 under the feet of any other crypto system available. That's also why
 I attach a great deal of importance to some form of PGP being

 I think that if you give your students copies of your comp.risks

 law that they will quit the program and you can then present your
 lectures to a class devoid of foreign (or any) students.
 Alternatively, you could check passports at the door, and boot out
 foreign students during the parts of your class which are essential
 to American Sickurity.  By doing so you will raise eyebrows well
 outside of the computer-and-law sphere of interest and you may bring
 this ludicrous situation into the limelight.  But then, you may get
 sacked.
 Probably a much more effective solution to your problem, and one which
 has recently been proven perfectly legal and acceptable in an American
 court, would be for you to merely shoot dead all the foreigners in your
 class, after which you can speak freely.

Summary: dump clipper
As a citizen working in the communications field, I am gravely
concerned by the 4/16/93 Clipper Chip initiative.  I believe that the initiative as proposed cannot accomplish its stated
goals, and will, if carried out, be poisonous to American business
attempts to compete in the secure communications field.
Far more important is the apparent denial in the press release of our
First, Second, Fourth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendment rights:
        ... nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."
I urge you to consider these actions instead:
     1. Lift export controls on all cryptographic hardware and software.
     2. Have the NSA work with NIST to produce a publicly-described
        algorithm, suitable for either hardware or software
        implementation, that can serve for the next 15 years as a
        follow-on to DES.
     3. Find some fair and legal way so that all US Citizens can use,
        royalty-free and without other restriction,
        the public-key algorithms now patented by PKP.
A lot of us have hopes for the human rights aspect of the Clinton-Gore
ticket. Please don't let us down: withdraw, abandon, or greatly modify
the Clipper Chip initiative.
I emphasize that I speak here as a private citizen, and my remarks
don't necessarily reflect the feelings of UUNET.

Fed officials pan ban of old encryption specs
by Gary H. Anthes
Gaithersburg, MD
Federal officials responsible for shaping information security
policy said last week that legislation mandating use of the
government's recently proposed encryption technology -- and
banning the use of older but popular techniques -- is neither
wise nor legal.
In April, the White House said it intended to establish as a
federal standard an approach to encryption called "key-escrow."
This method would require that the keys needed to unlock a coded
conversation be kept by government-approved agencies and
retrieved only for court-ordered wiretaps.
Dubbed "Clipper" for voice communications and "Capstone" for
data, the approach is intended to balance the conflicting
objectives of users -- who demand absolute security and privacy

IS managers assail data encryption rule
'Clipper chip would allow snooping
by Scott  Mace
And Shawn Willett
GAITHERSBURG, Md. -- IS managers and computer vendors last week
blasted the Clinton administration's plans to mandate use of the
"Clipper" data encryption chip.
During hearings hosted by the U.S. Commerce Department here last
week and in interviews, many IS managers and vendors said they
fear the encryption standard could make their operations
vulnerable not only to snooping by the government, but by
criminals as well.
IS managers and consultants from Bankers Trust Co. of New York
and Deloitte &Touche voiced these concerns at the hearing and
chided the government for shrouding the process in secrecy.
"The secret process up until now has been destructive to public
trust," said William Murray, IS consultant at Deloitte & Touche,
in Wilton, Conn.
"It is only a matter of time before hackers figure out a back
door to de-crypt it," said Sheldon Laube, national director of
information and technology at Price Waterhouse, in Menlo Park,
Laube echoed the concerns of other corporate data managers.
"If the government can de-encrypt it, we have to assume
competitors can as well," said Bob Holmes, computer technology
research analyst at Southern California Gas, in Los Angeles.
The chip, which would be installed in data communications
devices, including computers, modems, fax machines, and phones,
encrypts data so outsiders cannot listen in or steal sensitive
data. But government agencies, such as the FBI, could ask for a
court order to obtain the "keys" to decode the data.
No one would be forced to implement the chip, but the
administration proposal could mandate government agencies to buy
it, effectively forcing its widespread adoption.
The Clipper chip, jointly developed by the National Security
Agency and the national Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) was also assailed by computer vendors.
Oliver Smoot, vice president of the Computer and Business
Equipment Manufacturers Association (CBEMA), testified that its
members would have to develop separate product lines for the
United States and overseas because a few foreign governments
would want to give the U.S. government the capability to decode
their data transmissions. This, along with the inclusion of the
chip in every computer, would mean higher prices, Smoot said.
CBEMA members include Apple Computer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp.,
IBM, and Hewlett-Packard Co.
The plan has also been hotly contested by computer industry civil
libertarians, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which
urged that the Constitution's prohibition of illegal search and
seizure be applied.
NIST and other government agencies countered that the chip is
very resistant to tampering. It uses a key escrow system, where
two or more government agencies will hold parts of a decryption
key, for use by law enforcement with a valid court order.
The FBI expects organized crime and terrorists to begin encoding

@_subject: A definite trend 
I've been very busy this week busting my chops on a networking
project for a client, but I have to take a moment to add my own
few comments.
I realize that this is old news to some of you, but it appears that
many of you seem to forget that a rather unpleasant trend seems to
be developing within the law enforcement community. While we are
voicing our opposition to the "Key-Escrow" proposal (known to
most of us as Clipper/Capstone/Skipjack),  there are other historical
instances which are directly proportionate to where the LEAs are in
relationship to their efforts at legislating technology. The point that
I am attempting to make is that the "Key-Escrow" initiative is but
another extension of the earlier Digital Telephony proposal introduced
early last year (also known as "Son of S. 266"). As far as I'm
concerned, the "Key-Escrow" initiative is an attempted continuance of
a failed effort.
Excerpted from "Digital Media: A Seybold Report," April 20 1992 volume
1, number 11, page 7, is one of the first reports of this failed

Additionally, later in the article, a summary list is provided which
outlined the proposal, which is excerpted below -
"The F.B.I.  proposal
The following is taken directly from a Federal Bureau of Investigation
document distributed to legislators and other concerned parties in
Washington, DC.
Digital Telephony:
Summary of Issues
* The F.B.I.  utilizes electronic surveillance (wire taps) in virtually
  every area of its investigative responsibilities.
* The telecommunications industry, which remained virtually unchanged
  for approximately 50 years, is now rapidly changing to address the
  need for more advanced telecommunications systems, such as personal
  communications networks, advanced cellular and integrated services
  digital networks (ISDN) which have the capacity for high-speed
  transmissions of video, voice and data.
* One of the telephone telecommunications industry's major
  developmental efforts is to provide total digital connectivity (end
  to end) for its subscribers, including residential and business
  communities, in the near future.
* At present, no capability exists to intercept ISDN (digital)
  transmissions; therefore, the emergence of digital telecommunications
  technology will preclude the F.B.I.  and all of law enforcement from
  being able to intercept electronic communications, thus all but
  eliminating a statutorily-sanctioned, court-authorized and
  extraordinarily successful investigate technique.
* The Department of Justice and the F.B.I.  have been working with
  the White House, various Administration agencies, the
  telecommunications industry and Congress to find a workable solution to
  this very serious problem that endangers the safety of the American
  public.  A legislative solution has been developed to ensure that the
  legitimate need for law enforcement to lawfully intercept   is met by the telecommunications industry.
Legislative Remedy
The proposal would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require
providers of electronic communications services and private branch
exchanges to ensure that the Government's ability to lawfully intercept
communications is unimpeded by the introduction of advanced digital
telecommunications technology or any other emerging telecommunications
technology.  Specifically, the amendment provides the following:
1.  The FCC, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall determine
the technological interception needs of the Government and issue
regulations that will preserve the Government's ability to conduct
lawful electronic surveillance.
2.  The FCC shall issue regulations within 120 days after enactment
requiring the modification of existing telecommunication systems if
those systems impede the Government's ability to conduct lawful
electronic surveillance.
3.  Compliance by service providers and private branch exchanges will
be required within 180 days of the issuance of the regulations and the
use of non-conforming equipment is prohibited thereafter.
4.  The FCC has the authority to compensate (through rate structure)
telecommunication system operators under FCC jurisdiction for
reasonable costs associated with required modifications of existing
telecommunications equipment or technology.
5.  The Attorney General has specific authority, in addition to that
already vested in the FCC, to seek civil penalties and injunctive relief
for non-compliance."
[End of excerpt]
Of course, this bill died on "The Hill" because of lack of support. It
does suggest, however, that this is the tell-tale sign of a
continuing effort by the law enforcement community (which is grasping
at straws) to find ways to exploit domestic communications due to the
increasing complexity of technological advances in that area. LEAs are
also using highly volatile topics as drug enforcement and terrorism as
justification. While being politically correct, this does not justify
the scrutiny of private communications without reasonable

Crypto policy and business privacy
The White House wants businesses to protect data but leave doors
open to law-enforcement agencies
by Winn Schwartau
Following the Clinton administration's April 16 endorsement of
the Clipper chip, law-enforcement and privacy advocates are
staking out positions that will likely test the bounds of the
The Clipper chip, manufactured by Mykotronx Inc., of Torrance,
Calif., and officially designated the MYK-78, contains a
sophisticated encryption algorithm that protects a company's
communications by scrambling the data.
Announced as a joint technical effort between the NSA (National
Security Agency) and NIST (National Institute for Standards and
Technology), the chip is supposed to balance the needs of law
enforcement with businesses' need for data privacy.
The Clinton administration is encouraging American businesses to
adopt Clipper to ensure their own privacy, yet still permit
"lawful government electronic surveillance," according to a
statement released by the White House. Third-party products that
contain the Clipper chip are expected to be announced by fall.
The keys to decrypting Clipper communications will be held by two
independent parties, such as the Federal Reserve Board and a
private company. Attorney General Janet Reno had expected to
announce the holders of the keys in early May, but has delayed
the announcement until midsummer, according to a spokesman at the
Attorney General's office.
The Clipper endeavor stems from Bush-era intelligence-agency
attempts at adding legislative riders to congressional bills that
would have forced telecommunications and networking companies to
build in back doors for encrypted transmissions. The EFF
(Electronic Frontier Foundation) and CPSR (Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility), citizen groups based in Washington,
are generally credited with having such riders removed from
the bills.
Deep concern drives the anti-Clipper privacy advocates, many of
whom focus on the integrity of the encryption key-escrow agents
who will ultimately hold the keys to the U.S. digital kingdom if
the proposed program is successful. Said Kevin Murray, president
of Murray & Assoc., a security-consulting firm in Clinton, N.J.,
"I don't like Clipper at all. If you're going to offer privacy,
then offer it. I've seen too many cases where secrets easily
leaked out."
Few, if any, businesses appear willing to sign on with the
government's plan. Spearheaded by the EFF and the ACLU (American
Civil Liberties Union), 31 companies sent a letter last month to
the White House and Congress stating "... We believe that there
are fundamental privacy and other constitutional rights that must
be taken into account when any domestic surveillance is
proposed." Among the companies signing the letter were AT&T,
Apple Computer Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., IBM,
Hewlett-Packard Co., Lotus Development Corp., MCI Communications
Corp., Microsoft Corp., RSA Data Security Inc. and Sun
Microsystems Inc.
One area of concern among the companies is that the government
intends to keep all technical information about the Clipper
encryption algorithm secret. Conventional cryptological wisdom
says that only after wide-spread public analysis and comment can
an encryption technique be trusted.
CPSR last month filed a lawsuit against the National Security
Council seeking information about the Clipper chip.
"The Clipper plan was developed behind a veil of secrecy," said
Marc Rotenberg, director of CPSR's Washington office. "We need to
know why the standard was developed, what alternatives were
considered and what the impact will be on privacy.
"As the proposal currently stands, Clipper looks a lot like
desktop surveillance," Rotenberg said.
Said Mitch Kapor, founder of Lotus and chairman of the EFF, "An
[encryption] system based upon classified, secret technology will
not and should not gain the confidence of the American public."
On the other hand, Clipper chip supporters such as Dorothy
Denning, chairman of the Computer Science Dept. at Georgetown
University in Washington and a noted expert in the field of
cryptography, say the key-escrow system is more than adequate to
protect legitimate American interests.
Padgett Peterson, information-security specialist at defense
contractor Martin Marietta Corp., in Orlando, Fla., said, "I
believe Clipper's going to work. The government has more to lose
than we do." The Justice Department has already placed large
orders with AT&T for telephones fitted with Clipper encryption
chips. Said Peterson,"Soon enough, everyone will be using
Clipper: doctors, lawyers and CPAs."
However, the chip's use in other governmental agencies is not
assured. Neither the Federal Reserve Board nor the Department of
the Treasury has indicated that they will adopt Clipper.
Many business executives believe the government's encouragement
of voluntary adoption is only the first step in a plan drawn by
the intelligence community years ago that will eventually mandate
Clipper encryption for private businesses and outlaw all other
forms of encryption. The ACLU, EFF, CPSR and other watchdog
groups aim to ensure that the government never goes that far.
American businesses that adopt Clipper encryption in their
networks and communications systems will have to accept some
far-reaching assumptions, according to its skeptics:
- that the Clipper algorithm is robust enough to secure their
  corporate information assets domestically and internationally.
  The international security community already believes American
  data to be less secure than it should be and worries about
  leaving doors open to the United States;
- that the government does not have its own back door to read
  encrypted communications;
- that the key-escrow agents, once named, can be trusted;
- that the key-escrow repository, a vault that contains the
  Clipper chip serial numbers and encrypting and decrypting keys,
  will be secure enough to withstand a dedicated attack. The
  Attorney General's office also plans to announce this summer
  what form the repository will take -- electronic or otherwise
  -- and how it will be secured;
- that by its very use, the company is not unintentionally giving
  up its right to privacy or other constitutional rights; and
- that purchasing machines that include the hardware-based
  Clipper chip is better than using currently available and
  field-tested software encryption techniques such as DES and
  RSA.
The response to Clipper has been negative despite pleas from the
administration that "while [other forms of] encryption technology
can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized
release of personal information, [they] also can be used by
terrorists, drug dealers and other criminals."
Martin Marietta's Peterson still believes Clipper is "good
enough" for business, but he is in the minority. The majority
opinion holds that Clipper may be what the government wants, but
it shouldn't even think about making any laws mandating its use.

Clipped Wings?
Encryption Chip Draws Fire
Part of the Clinton administration's vision for a digital America
is a fast encryption chip to help companies and individuals
protect their secrets from prying eyes as voice and data messages
are sent over communications wires. The catch is that this
encryption chip includes a backdoor that will let
law-enforcement agencies listen in. The White House believes that
the hardware will protect all Americans' right to privacy while
also protecting them from those who break the law.
The chip is named Clipper (because Intergraph in Huntsville,
Alabama, manufactures a processor with the same name, the Clipper
moniker will likely be changed). It is a 12 Mbps encryption
coprocessor designed by Mykotronx (Torrance, CA) and manufactured
by VLSI (San Jose, CA). The chip is built in a tamper-resistant
package to prevent reverse-engineering efforts to reveal the
classified algorithm used inside.
Along with privacy concerns that the government could abuse its
ability to tap digital wires, another impediment to widespread
acceptance of Clipper will be its cost. Ben Stolz, a member of
the technical staff at Sun Microsystems (Mountain View, CA),
says, "Our rule of thumb is that a part that costs n dollars adds
3n to 4n dollars to the final price [of a computer]." Raymond
Kammer, acting director of the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD), recently told a U.S.
congressional committee that he hopes the Mykotronx chips will
eventually cost $26 each if purchased in large quantities. That
means a potential $75 to $100 addition to the price of each
computer that uses the chip.
Critics of the Clipper chip note that less expensive chips that
provide DES encryption have not received widespread acceptance
because software encryption, although usually slower than
hardware, is less expensive. Jim Bidzos, president of RSA Data
Securities (Redwood City, CA), says, "This is just another arrow
aimed at preventing people from using RSA." RSA's cryptographic
routines will be included in new releases of system software
written by Apple and Novell and are already used in Lotus Notes.
The government will undoubtedly provide a large market for the
Clipper chip initially. President Clinton has already directed
the U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to purchase several thousand
units for use in computers and secure phones. The impact of the
chip on the rest of the world, though, will be governed by

Steve Jackson Games v. US Secret Service
by Peter D. Kennedy
On March 12, 1993, a federal judge in Austin, Texas decided that
the US Secret Service broke the law when it searched Steve
Jackson Games Inc., and seized its bulletin board system and
other computer equipment. The decision in this case has been
long-awaited in the computer world, and most observers have
hailed it as a significant victory for computer user's freedom
and privacy.
I had the fortune to be one of the lawyers representing Steve
Jackson and his co-plaintiffs. During the course of the lawsuit, I
met many people passionately interested in the issues the case
raised. I watched and listened to the discussions and arguments
about the case. I've been impressed by the intelligence of the
on-line world, and the interest that computer enthusiasts show --
especially computer communications enthusiasts -- in the law.
I've also been impressed and distressed at how the Net can
spontaneously generate misinformation. Steve Jackson has spent
untold hours correcting errors about him, his company, and the
case on both the Net and more traditional news media.
The decision in the Steve Jackson Games case is clearly a
significant victory for computer users, especially BBS operators
and subscribers. I hope to give a simple and clear explanation
for the intelligent non-lawyer of the legal issues raised by the
case, and the significance and limitations of the court's
The facts.
By now, most people interested in the case are familiar with the
basic facts: On March 1, 1990, the Secret Service, in an
early-morning raid, searched the offices of Steve Jackson Games.
The agents kept the employees out of the offices until the
afternoon, and took the company's BBS -- called "Illuminati" --
along with an employee's work computer, other computer equipment,
and hundreds and hundreds of floppy disks. They took all the
recent versions of a soon-to-be-published game book, "GURPS
Cyberpunk," including big parts of the draft which were publicly
available on Illuminati.
On March 2, Steve Jackson tried to get copies of the seized files
back from the Secret Service. He was treated badly, and given
only a handful of files from one office computer. He was not
allowed to touch the Illuminati computer, or copy any of its
Steve Jackson Games took a nosedive, and barely avoided going
out of business. According to Jackson, eight employees lost their
jobs on account of the Secret Service raid, and the company lost
many thousands of dollars in sales. It is again a busy
enterprise, no thanks to the Secret Service (although they tried
to take credit, pointing to the supposedly wonderful publicity
their raid produced.)
After months of pestering, including pressure by lawyers and
Senator Lloyd Bentson (now, as Treasury Secretary, the Secret
Service's boss) the Secret Service returned most of the
equipment taken, some of it much the worse for wear.
By then, Steve Jackson had restarted Illuminati on a different
computer. When the old Illuminati computer was finally given
back, Jackson turned it one -- and saw that all the electronic
mail which had been on the board on March 1 was gone! Wayne Bell,
WWIV developer and guru, was called in. He gave us invaluable
(and free) help evaluating the condition of the files. He
concluded, and testified firmly at trial, that during the week of
March 20, 1990, when the Secret Service still had Illuminati,
the BBS was run, and every piece of e-mail was individually
accessed and deleted. The Illuminati files the Secret Service had
returned to Steve Jackson left irrefutable electronic traces of
what had been done -- even I could understand how the condition
and dates of the e-mail files showed what had happened, and when.
The lawsuit.
Suing the federal government and its agents is never a simple
thing. The United States can only be sued when it consents.
Lawsuits against individual agents face big legal hurdles erected
to protect government officials from fear off a tidal wave of
Amazing as it may sound, you cannot sue the United States (or any
federal agency) for money damages for violating your
constitutional rights. You can sue individual federal agents,
though. If you do, you have to get past a defense called
"qualified immunity" which basically means you have to show that
the officials violated "clearly established" constitutional law.
For reasons I can't explain briefly, "qualified immunity" often
creates a vicious circle in civil rights litigation, where the
substance of constitutional law is never established because the
court never has determine the Constitution's scope, only whether
the law was "clearly established" at the time of the violation.
The strongest remedies for federal over-stepping are often
statutes which allow direct suit against the United States or
federal agencies (although these are less dramatic than the
Constitution). Fortunately, these statutes were available to
Steve Jackson and the three Illuminati users who joined him in
his suit against the Secret Service.
The legal claims.
The Steve Jackson Games case was a lot of things to a lot of
people. I saw the case as having two basic goals: (1) to redress
the suppression of the public expression embodied in Steve
Jackson's publications (including his publication via BBS) and
thereby compensate the company for the damage unnecessarily done
by the raid, and (2) to redress the violation of the privacy of
the BBS users, and the less tangible harm they suffered.
The individual government agents involved in the raid were sued
for constitutional violations -- the First and Fourth Amendments.
The Secret Service was sued under two important laws which embody
the same principles as the First and Fourth Amendments -- the
Privacy Protection Act of 1980 and provisions of the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act of 1986. There were other claims, but
these were the core.
After the case was pending a year and a half and all discovery
completed, the government moved to have thee claims dismissed,
claiming qualified immunity. This motion (usually brought early
in a case) guaranteed that the trail would be delayed by over a
year, because even if the government lost its motion, the
individuals could immediately appeal. In December, 1992, the
tactical decision was made to drop those claims, rather than
suffer the delay, and proceed promptly to trail on the claims
against the Secret Service itself.
The Privacy Protection Act of 1980.
In the late 1970's the Stanford Daily was subjected to a fishing
expedition by police officers in the Stanford Daily's newsroom.
The police were looking for notes and photos of a demonstration
the newspaper had covered for a story, hoping the newspaper's
files would identify suspects. The Supreme Court held in 1979
that the newspaper had no separate First Amendment right
protecting it from searches and seizures of its reporters notes
and photographs if they were "evidence" of a crime the paper had
covered -- even when the newspaper was not under any suspicion
itself. Congress responded in 1980 with the Privacy Protection
Act, which, until Steve jackson came along, was distinguished
mostly by its lack of interpretation by courts.
The Act's wording is rather obtuse, but basically it enacts a
"subpoena only" rule for publishers -- law enforcement officials
are not allowed to search for evidence of crimes in publisher's
offices, or more accurately, they  may not "search for or seize"
publishers' "work product" or "documentary materials",
essentially draft of publications, writer's notes, and such.  To
get such material, the police must subpoena them, not with the
much more disruptive search warrant. Every BBS sysop should read
this act, located at 42 U.S.C. 2000aa in the law books, because I
can't fully explain it here.
The Act is quite broad, protecting from searches and seizures
the work product and commentary materials of anyone who has "a
purpose to disseminate to the public a newspaper, book,
broadcast, or other similar form of public communication..." It
also has a big exception -- if the publisher is the person
suspected in the criminal investigation.
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
Two provisions of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (or
ECPA) were paramount in the suit. The plaintiffs claimed the
Secret Service violated two provisions -- one prohibiting
unjustified "disclosure and use" of e-mail (18 U.S.C. 2703; the
other prohibiting "interception" of e-mail (18 U.S.C. 22511(1)).
The parties' positions were fairly simple, and laid out well
before trail. As for the Privacy Protection Act, Steve Jackson
claimed that his company's publication, both in book form and on
Illuminati, were obviously "work product" protected by the Act,
and the government had no right to seize them, and therefore owed
him money for the damages the raid caused his business. The
government replied claiming that (1) Steve Jackson Games'
products are not the type of publications protected by the PPA;
and anyway, (2) the Secret Service didn't know that Steve Jackson
Games was a publisher when it raided its offices; and even then,
(3) the Secret Service didn't mean to take the books, the books
just came along when the computers and disks were taken.
As for the e-mail, Steve Jackson and the other BBS users claimed
that the seizure, disclosure, and deletion of the e-mail was both
an unlawful "disclosure and use," and an "interception" of
electronic communications in violation of the ECPA. The Secret
Service replied that (1) there was no "interception" because the
e-mail was just sitting there on the hard drive, not moving; and
(2) the Secret Service didn't read the mail, but if it did, it
was acting on good faith, because it had a search warrant
authorizing it so seize Steve Jackson Games' "computers" and read
their contents.
The trial.
When the individual defendants were dropped, the case quickly
went to trail. The plaintiffs opened their case on January 29,
1993. The trail took the better part of four days; the witnesses
included now-familiar names: Timothy Foley and Barbara Golden of
the Secret Service, William Cook, formerly of the U.S. Attorney's
office in Chicago, Henry Kluepfel of Bellcore, Steve Jackson and
the BBS users Elizabeth McCoy, Walter Milliken and Steffan
O'Sullivan, and WWIV master Wayne Bell.
At trail, Judge Sparks was introduced to the labyrinthine E911
investigation. We also set up and ran Illuminati as it looked on
March 1, 1990, and Steve Jackson walked Judge Sparks through his
BBS, lingering on discussion areas such as "GURPS Old West" to
give the Judge a taste of the scope and breadth of BBS
publication and communications which the Secret Service had shut
down. The judge had appeared upset by the callous and suspicious
manner in which the Secret Service had treated Steve Jackson, and
with the Service's apparent disregard for the effects the raid
might have on the company.
The decision.
Judge Sparks decided the case in February, 1993, in a long
written opinion. The full text of the opinion is available on
the Internet at ftp.eff.org, and on Illuminati itself
(512-447-7866). I recommend all sysops and BBS users to read it,
as it is one of the very few legal rulings specifically
addressing bulletin boards and electronic mail.
First, the bad news: Judge Sparks accepted the government's
argument that the seizure of the BBS was not an "interception" of
the e-mail, even mail that had not yet been read. Essentially, he
decided that the definition of "interception" implicitly means
"contemporaneously with the transmission"; that is, for there to
be an interception, the government must position itself in the
data stream. like a conventional wiretap. Since the e-mail was
temporarily stored on the BBS hard drive, he held there was no
contemporaneous interception.
Ruling that there was no interception means two things. First,
the plaintiffs did not receive the $10,000 minimum damages a
violation of the "interception" law provides, even though the
judge found the Secret Service had not acted in good faith. More
importantly, it lowers the standard for seizing BBS e-mail -- and
threatens to lower the standard for the seizure of all electronic
communications which reside long enough in computer memory to be
seized (which is most all computer communications, as far as I
understand it).  To "intercept" wire communications you need a
court order, not just a routine search warrant. This ruling
(which technically only applies in Western District of Texas)
means law enforcement is not limited in its seizure of BBSs by
the higher standards required of wire-tapping.
Now, the good news: the plaintiffs won the "disclosure and use"
argument under the ECPA, getting back most of what was lost in
the "interception" decision. First, Judge Sparks found the
obvious: that while the Secret Service had Illuminati they or
their agents read and deleted all the e-mail on Illuminati,
including the plaintiffs' mail -- persons the Secret Service
admittedly having no reason at all to suspect of any illegal
Next, he rejected the Secret Service's argument that its agents
were acting in "good faith." While he didn't list all the
reasons, quite a few are supported by the evidence: the Secret
Service's investigation was "sloppy", he said, and there was no
attempt to find out what Steve Jackson Games did as a business;
the Secret Service was told the day of the raid that the company
was a "publisher," and refused to make copies or return files for
months after they were done reviewing them; and the Secret
Service apparently allowed the private mail of dozens of entirely
innocent and unsuspecting people to be read and trashed.
The judge ruled that Steve Jackson, his company, and the three
Illuminati users who joined Jackson in the suit were each
entitled to an $1,000 award from the government, as provided by
the ECPA.
The Privacy Protection Act was pretty much a clean sweep. While
the judge and Steve Jackson still differ over how much money the
raid cost the company, the court's ruling was squarely in
Jackson's favor on the law. Although unconventional, the court
found that Steve Jackson Games' publications were clearly
covered by the Act, should not have been seized, and should have
been promptly returned. At trail, the Secret Service agents had
freely admitted they knew nothing about the Act. Former U.S.
Attorney William Cook claimed he knew about it before the raid,
but decided (without any investigation) that Steve Jackson Games
wasn't covered. The Privacy Protection Act (unlike the ECPA)
allows no "good faith" excuses, anyway, and since the Secret
Service was repeatedly told on March 1 and afterwards that the
company was a publishing business there was no defense for the
seizure of "GURPS Cyberpunk" or the other book drafts. Most of
the over $50,000 awarded in damages was due to the violation of
the Privacy Protection Act.
Steve Jackson Games publishes traditional books and magazines,
with printed paper pages. Is the BBS operator who publishes only
on-line articles protected, too? It's a question Judge Sparks did
not need to address directly, but his opinion can and should be
read to include the on-line publisher. The court's opinion
includes the BBS files as material improperly seized, and the Act
specifically includes work product in electronic form. Publishing
via BBSs has become just like publishing a "newspaper, book, or
other form of publication..." -- the only source of news many
people get.
If the Privacy Protection Act is broadly understood to encompass
electronic publishing (as it should) it should provide
meaningful protection to innocent sysops whose boards may be
used by some for illegal purposes. It should prevent the
"preventative detention" of BBSs -- where boards are seized in
investigations and held indefinitely -- which seems to be one
crude means used to attack suspected criminal activity without
bothering to actually prosecute a case. It should also force law
enforcement to consider who the actual suspect is -- for
instance, in the recent spate of seizures of BBSs for suspected
copyright violations. The Privacy Protection Act should prevent
law enforcement from seizing a sysop's board who is not suspect
in engaging or condoning illegal activity.
Those of you who have followed this case will note how little
significance I've given to the "Phrack" investigation and the
overvaluation of the E911 document. Of course the Secret Service
misunderstood or exaggerated the importance of the purloined E911
document, and were chasing imaginary goblins.
The real significance of the Steve Jackson Games case, however,
was not knocking holes in that one investigation (the Neidorf
trail effectively did that), but taking a solid step to set firm,
discernible limits for criminal investigations involving computer
communication. To focus on the specific foibles of the E911
investigation is to miss the importance of what the Secret
Service really did wrong. Out of ignorance or callousness, they
ignored the legal rights of people not even suspected of crimes;
people who simple shared common electronic space. There are and
will continue to be legitimate computer-crime investigations. The
closeness that people live in Cyberspace, though, means the
government must learn ways to conduct investigations without
violating the rights of all the innocent members of the on-line
community. In March 1990, the Privacy Protection Act said that
Steve Jackson could write and publish his books without having
them seized; the Secret Service didn't know that. In 1990, the
Illuminati users had the right not to have their e-mail seized
and read without at least being suspected of a crime; the Secret
Service apparently didn't know that, either. Now they do, and
hopefully the word will spread to other government agencies,
(As of this writing, there is still no decision whether the
Secret Service (or Steve Jackson, for that matter) will appeal
Judge Spark's decision.)

The Intelligence Test
Do tight funds and technophobia impede the CIA's ability to
gather information?
by Francis Hamit
As the United States turns 217 years old this week, the officials
responsible for the computers and communications of the nation's
intelligence agencies are in no mood for a party. Many of their
systems are antiquated, inefficient, and sometimes dangerously
ineffective. Their resources are being taxed by the changing
demands of post-Cold War politics. They need money to update
their systems, yet a Democratic Congress appears intent on
cutting the overall intelligence budget by more than $1 billion.
To top it all off, IS officials in the intelligence community
face an internal cultural bias against computers; some CIA
employees see the machines as little more than electronic
security leaks. "They just don't get it," says industry analyst
Esther Dyson, who recently visited the CIA with an Electronic
Frontier Foundation delegation. "It's depressing."
Yet, the U.S. intelligence community, under the leadership of the
CIA, is undergoing a quiet revolution in culture and
methodology. The IT component of the effort is being led by
Michael L. Dillard, chairman of the information policy board in
the Office of the Director of Central Intelligence, essentially
the intelligence community's CIO.
Dillard has the authority to do the job. He reports directly to
the director of central intelligence, R. James Woolsey. Dillard
and Woolsey's charter includes the CIA -- which is in the process
of trying to fill a new CIO position of their own -- as well as
government departments such as the Bureau of Research and
Intelligence in the State Department, the intelligence elements
of the various Armed Forces, the Energy Department's intelligence
component, the National Security Agency, even units of the
Treasury Department. Factor in the ad hoc task forces and working
groups set up to handle specific areas of concern such as
terrorism, narcotics, and transnational criminal activities, and
it's a potentially cacophonous collection of sources to manage
in a real-time environment -- and with an extremely limited
margin for error.
The Agency That Knew Too Much?
The intelligence community's work is breathtaking in scope. Raw
data floods in daily from every conceivable source. Technical
collection efforts such as signals interception and high-
resolution imaging from spy satellites and other sources are
combined with the reports of agents and secret sources around the
world and "open sources," such as newspaper articles and radio
broadcasts. All this information flows like a river into a system
that must select, analyze, and evaluate significant data, and
then turn it into easy-to-understand digests for policymakers.
But the overall system is not working as well as it should, and
the need for reform has long been acknowledged by members of the
intelligence community. The CIA alone runs 10 data processing
systems; under the current classification and
compartmentalization, there is virtually no interoperability
between them (see related story below). This has led to some
public embarrassments. Recently, for example, the agency was
accused of covering up part of the BNL scandal, in which an
Italian bank used U.S. Agriculture Department guarantees to help
Saddam Hussein finance Iraq's arms buildup before the Gulf War.
This accusation came after the CIA first denied knowledge of the
affair, then later found the requested documents in a file box
under a staff member's desk.
The current reforms began last year under former director of
central intelligence Robert Gates and have continued under
Woolsey, who was a member of the committee that made the
original reform recommendations. Late last year, before the
annual convention of the Association of Former Intelligence
Officers, Gates identified the targets for intelligence community
reform as nothing less than "our mission, our structure, our
long-term size and budget, and our culture."
These changes come at a time when intelligence consumers are
demanding interactive, multimedia systems that better meet their
needs and time constraints. Given the current climate of budget
cutbacks and growing demands, the community may undergo a major
restructuring that will force wider use of distributed,
multimedia computer and communications systems.
CIO Dillard is unable to detail precise changes to the
intelligence community's IS effort because information such as
various agencies' IS budget and staff size is strictly
classified. But he shared his five goals for IS in the
intelligence community:
o Increase the volume of data, especially from "open sources."
  The first Open Source Coordinator has been appointed.
o Attain true connectivity and interoperability among the systems
  used in the intelligence community. While some are PC- and
  workstation-based and use commercially available software,
  traditional approaches to security had mandated that they not
  be linked.
o Reduce the growing cost of operating and maintaining legacy
  systems. Today, 82 cents of every dollar spent by IS groups in
  intelligence goes to maintain and operate existing systems.
  "This," says Dillard,"is using up our resources and driving out
  our ability to recapitalize and meet new requirements."
o Downsize systems.
o Create an equal infusion of technology throughout the
  community. While some computers in use are leading edge,
  others date back to the 1960s, Some software is 25 years old.
These initiatives would be difficult in any environment, But the
intelligence community also harbors a cultural bias against
electronic systems. It stems, in part, from the need to secure
information in such a way to protect sources and methods. "In the
proper-based world, this is not a problem," Dillard says. "In the
electronic one, the ability to connect and compare data can lead
to unintended compromises of security."
Indeed, the intelligence community has had an explosion of
literally thousands of databases. Open sources alone command
4,000 databases of all kinds; the most sensitive are kept
offline. Many paper files are never converted to digital form.
With the intelligence community creating an estimated 20,000
digital records a day, the job of digitizing and transferring
older paper files is relegated to the to-do pile.
The agencies are researching and developing software tools to
break through this logjam by helping analysts search very large
databases. This effort is being managed by the Intelligence
Community Management Staff, a separate entity charged with
implementing much of the reform.
Congress has had much to say about the intelligence community's
need to eliminate redundant computer systems. But unlike in
private businesses, redundant sources in intelligence may
actually help clarify information by providing additional checks
on incoming data.  Redundant information also helps guard against
deception schemes by adversary intelligence services.
In addition, while the community's rapidly growing stream of data
demands the use of the latest technology, the open systems
approach that works best in the business world is unfamiliar,
possibly even threatening, to those in the intelligence community.
Past attempts to cut one type of collection in favor of another
generally have been damaging. In the late '70s, director of
central intelligence Stansfield Turner emphasized technical means
over human intelligence sources -- he was uncomfortable with
spies and forced out many veteran covert operatives. Turner's
critics say the efforts may have led to an inability to respond
to anti-American terrorist operations in the Middle East,
such as the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marines barracks in Beirut,
which was aggravated by the bombing and subsequent kidnapping and
murder of the CIA's local station chief.
Satellites Alone Don't Fly
Only 30% to 40% of all intelligence gathering is the result of
technical means such as satellite surveillance and signals
interception. Another 30% comes from open sources, while an
overwhelming 80% is derived from human sources (the total exceeds
100% to account for overlap between sources). Many in the
intelligence community believe there is no substitute for the
human analyst.
Funding for the intelligence community's new IT efforts may be
scarce. Despite Clinton administration efforts to expand the
overall intelligence budget to more than $28 billion in order to
cope with the changes caused by the collapse of the Soviet
Union, Congress seems intent upon cutting more than $1 billion
from current levels.
Not surprisingly, intelligence professionals are horrified by
this prospect in the midst of the agencies' most profound
cultural change and organizational restructuring since World War
II. They fear that vital programs may be damaged, eroding the
nation's ability to cope with new challenges.
At the same time, the intelligence community is trying to
downsize by attrition and has cut expenditures by 17.5%. Hiring
has been cut back both for career and contract agents, and many
veterans are being offered early retirement.
Some intelligence officers feel budget cuts could interfere with
the community's recruiting ability. "The lifeblood of the
intelligence community is bringing in new people and giving them
experience and training," says David Whipple, a CIA veteran and
now executive director of the association of Former Intelligence
The demands upon the intelligence community since the end  of the
Cold War have grown more complex. Veterans of the Cold War era
sometimes even wax nostalgic. "The Cold War simplified things
into a bipolar world," says one CIA veteran analyst. "It froze a
lot of things, like the situation in the Balkans, which have now
erupted with a vengeance."
In the 1980s, nearly 60% of the overall intelligence budget was
focused upon the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact nations. At
first glance, it would seem that this amount could now be cut.
But with the fluid geopolitical situation and the emergence of
dozens of new players, the requirements in Eastern Europe are
increasing, the agencies argue.
Not surprisingly, so is the use of computing. "We've all had to
develop an understanding of computing and how to use it in out
day-today work," says a CIA public affairs officer. While
mainframes still dominate, PCs are appearing on intelligence
desktops, joining older systems rather than replacing them.
There's still a long way to go for real change. And the
intelligence community's wary attitude could mean necessary
changes are made later rather than sooner. "There's this sort of
intellectual understanding of change, but there's none of that
understanding, somewhere between emotional and intellectual,
where you 'get it,'" says analyst Dyson. "Some of them do, but to
me a good intelligence service is smarter than everybody else."

Downsizing: Is It Safe?
An ongoing debate is raging within the U.S. intelligence
community about large-scale computer systems. Michael Dillard,
chairman of the information policy board in the Office of the
Director of Central Intelligence, talks about reviewing
standalone systems to see if they can be combined, or at least
made co-resident, with other systems on similar hardware. This
would cut operations and maintenance staffing, but it would also
make such systems more vulnerable to compromise. Such a melding
of data sets violates the well-established culture of keeping
secrets by separating them on a "need-to-know" basis.
Given the literally millions of people who have Confidential,
Secret, Top Secret, and higher clearances, the real surprise is
not that there is an occasional traitor such as Jonathan Pollard
or John Walker, but that there are not more such breaches of
security. Of course, for the intelligence community, one is too
many. Pollard, for instance, is said to have given 85,000
documents to his Israeli handlers. And the full extent of the
damage done by Walker during his 20 years of spying for the
Soviets may never be known, but certainly codes and other vital
intelligence sources and methods were compromised.
"Sources and methods" are, of course, the most closely held
secrets of any intelligence service. While former director of
central intelligence Robert Gates initiated a vigorous
declassification program, a National Archives official recently
complained that the review and declassification of documents from
the 1960s alone would take nearly 20 years to complete at the
present rate. In fact, the U.S. government still holds classified
documents that date back to World War I.
"Why shouldn't there be one national policy concerning the
protection of valuable national assets?" asks Maynard C.
Anderson, an assistant deputy undersecretary of defense, in a
recent letter to Security Management magazine. He notes that laws
such as the Atomic Energy Act, the Arms Control Act, and the
Privacy Act have added categories of information to be protected
but not a mechanism for the overall administration of information
security. "The lack of a single, coordinated, national
information policy has resulted in the fragmentation of
policy-making and prevented the allocation of resources where
they are needed most."
Such issues are consciously avoided by both civilian and military
intelligence officers who view themselves as the implementors
rather than the makers of policy. The highly compartmentalized
approach of sharing information only with those who "need to
know" is the ultimate protection of sources and methods.
Dire Consequences
More important, it saves lives. An agent-in-place can be run for
years with his or her true identity known only to a handful of
people within one agency. In such a circumstance, the data from
the source must be heavily filtered to avoid compromising the
source's identity, which could have fatal consequences for the
operation and the agent. The downside is that it allows ad hoc
operations to take place, such as Iran-Contra, which was mounted
from within the basement of the National Security Council offices
in the White House. (It also explains why Robert Gates was not
informed about the operation despite his position at the time as
deputy director of intelligence.)
Computer networks have not proven themselves to be absolutely
secure, so the  creation of an electronic system vulnerable to
compromise goes very much against the grain of senior officers.
But the need for quicker processing is apparent, as is the need
for absolute security. It is a big problem not easily resolved.
In fact, resolution may depend upon software yet to be
developed, possibly by a new generation of programmers who will
be offered well-paying jobs  by private enterprise at a time
when government research dollars are being absorbed by current
program needs.

The right to be secure
Government-backed data security standard raises Big Brother issues
By James Daly
Two months ago, the Clinton administration dropped a bomb on the
world of computer security.
In an effort to assist law enforcement officers looking for a
legal back door into coded criminal communications, officials
from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
and the National Security Agency (NSA) said they intend to
establish as a federal standard an approach to voice and data
encryption called "key escrow." This method would require the
technology needed to unlock a coded conversation to be kept by
government-approved agencies and retrieved in the event of
government-approved wiretaps.
Data encryption would be done in silicon via a device called the
"Clipper chip," which would be installed in machines needing its
coding and decoding capabilities.
To put it mildly, the Clipper chip proposal has generated a lot
of excitement among privacy advocates who fear abuses by a
technologically empowered Big Brother.
Computerworld recently tried to talk with officials from both the
NIST and the NSA to further explore the Clipper issue, but
neither allowed a face-to-face interview with a staff member.
Instead, we had to submit written questions.
Here are the answers provided by officials from the NIST and the
Q. The proposed Clipper chip technology has generated an awful
   lot of acrimony since it was announced in April. Has the
   government lessened its level of commitment to the chip?
A. The administration remains committed too the initiative and is
   proceeding with the following actions: the acquisition of key
   escrow encryption devices by law enforcement agencies; the
   naming of key escrow agents to hold the keys for the key
   escrow microcircuits and the establishment of procedures by
   the attorney general for the access of the keys; the
   evaluation of the key escrow encryption algorithm by respected
   experts; the promulgation of a standard by the secretary of
   commerce to facilitate the procurement and use of key escrow
   encryption devices in federal communications systems; and the
   comprehensive review of encryption policy.
   In addition, discussions with industry and other concerned
   groups have proved very productive. The administration does
   not intend to arbitrarily end its study of the issue while
   helpful consultations are under way.
   It should also be understood that the use of products
   implementing the key escrow encryption microcircuit is
   voluntary. There has been no attempt to either mandate its use
   or to deny the entry of other encryption technologies into the
   marketplace.
Q. Privacy advocates say that if the keys needed to de-crypt
   data are placed in the hands of government authorities, there
   is the potential for abuse. What kinds of safeguards would be
   implemented to prevent this?
A. The government may conduct electronic surveillance only when
   lawfully authorized. Moreover, the key escrow procedures being
   developed provide that each key will be split into two parts,
   and different key escrow authorities will hold each part.
   Neither part alone can be used to decrypt messages.
   To obtain the key needed to unlock the encryption, law
   enforcement must present evidence of its authority for a key,
   typically a court order, to both key escrow authorities.
   Finally, the system will be designed to ensure that law
   enforcement destroys the keys it receives when its authority
   to conduct the electronic surveillance has expired.
Q. Vendors who have extensive business overseas say they would
   not be able to sell Clipper-equipped machines on foreign
   shores. How do you respond?
A. Key-escrowed products will be exportable to U.S. persons and
   companies operating overseas. One issue under consideration in
   the presidential review is whether a broader export policy is
   advisable. Should a broader export policy be adopted, we
   believe products implementing the key escrow technology will
   find favor among consumers who desire the superb encryption
   security offered.
Q. If Clipper would be the standard, would the use of non-Clipper
   encryption devices be outlawed? If so, how would you find out
   who was using these non-Clipper devices?
A. No. Use of key-escrowed products by the private sector would
   be entirely voluntary. Federal agencies will have the option
   of using this technology once it becomes a Federal Information
   Processing Standard. DES [Data Encryption Standard], the
   existing federal encryption standard, will still be available
   for use in federal systems.
Q. Regarding DES, some security experts say that with powerful
   chips such as Pentium already on the market and the 686 and
   786 in design stages, DES is getting near to being crackable.
   Is DES nearing the end of its useful life?
A. NIST will recommend that DES be renewed for another five years
   as a Federal Information Processing Standard. We do recognize,
   however, that as computer technology advances, the expected
   effort needed to break DES-encrypted messages decreases. In
   time, DES will become less valuable for securing sensitive
   information.
Q. What eventually made DES and other cryptosystems acceptable was
   their ease of use in software. Do you feel companies will be
   willing to go back to the hassle and additional expenses of
   hardware-based cryptography?
A. Again, we must emphasize that use of this technology is
   voluntary. Software containing other cryptosystems is still
   available to consumers. As for use of this technology in
   hardware, new products are already being developed to lessen
   the "hassle" of hardware-based cryptography. One example would
   be its use of PCMCIA [Personal Computer Memory Card
   International Association] cards. Moreover, encryption
   implemented in software generally provides less security than
   hardware encryption.
Q. What happens when the Clipper chip's technology cannot keep up
   with faster networks and becomes a bottleneck? Do we then have
   to have a multiyear review process wherein we select a
   Clipper-2 chip and retrofit all the devices across the
   country?
A. We expect the key escrow microcircuits will be enhanced to keep
   pace with future data requirements. As with the introduction
   of any next-generation technology, consumers will decide the
   extent to which they require, and are willing to pat for, the
   new technology. We do not envision an "across the country"
   retrofit of all devices.
Q. What should the role of the government, if any, in developing
   a nationwide computer security policy guideline?
A. The government has a strong interest in computer security
   policies in light of the federal agencies' need to protect
   their own information: for law enforcement agencies to

   security policy is appropriate. Government must be actively
   involved in setting computer security standards for its own
   use and making its technology, expertise and guidance

   appropriate. Private sector organizations can then make
   appropriate risk-based, cost-effective decisions as to

Washington, DC area Cypherpunks:
I have accepted a consulting position in the DC area which will not
require consistent travel (unlike my current job), which I will begin
the first of August. This position will be designing, implementing and
configuring routed Internet access data networks for one of the big
three carriers (no, not AT&T).
Anyway, I'd like to find out how many of the DCypherpuuks are willing
to plan a physical meeting for mid-August to discuss current
happenings, sign keys and the likes.
E-mail me if you are interested.

Immediately following the above text, was contained a list of computer
viruses, virus construction tools and virus disassemblies.
In the subsequent storm of debate, there have been several scathing
articles written about the way the situation was  brought into public
knowledge, including a front-page article in the Washington Post and
several rather scathing articles in Computer Underground Digest (CuD
5.51) and a rebuttal (of sorts, CuD 5.52) in which I stated my own
position on the matter.
It is also been brought to my attention that certain underground
hackers have vowed to seek revenge in some fashion, which really
worries me the least.
My main concern is that this instance of valid utilization of
"whistleblowing" has been overshadowed by the ravings of virus
exchange enthusiasts and underground virus distribution and propagation
groups who are calling "Foul!" without closely examine the
implications of their own actions (a topic which I will not launch
into at this time).
In fact, I applaud Peter G. Neumann, moderator of RISKS Forum for
allowing the anonymous post to be posted to the list in the first
place. Another copy of the message was sent anonymously to VIRUS-L
Digest (comp.virus list) where Ken van Wyk, the moderator, decided not
to post it. (A raspberry to Ken for that one.)
Perhaps the remainder of the  net is not quite ready to acknowledge
anonymity? As I stated above, I'd really like to hear some of your
thoughts on the matter...

It Could Happen to Anyone
Law enforcement out of control.
by David Z. Nevin
Randy Weaver was an insignificant little man, struggling to
survive with his family of five in a plywood cabin in the
mountains of north Idaho when he became a target of his
government. His story is important because it illustrates law
enforcement out of control -- and because it could happen to
Weaver held beliefs about racial separation that are repugnant
to most Americans. But he had served honorably in the military,
had no criminal record and in 1989 had violated no laws. Then the
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms turned its gaze upon him
because it believed (incorrectly) that he was a member of a
neo-Nazi group. An ATF informer -- a spy -- persuaded Weaver to
saw off two shotguns and sell them. ATF then sprung its trap:
Weaver must infiltrate and spy on thee Nazi group himself or be
indicted for sale of the shotguns.
When Weaver refused to spy he was arrested, taken to court and
released pending trials. Alarmed by a series of suspiciously
inconsistent statements by court personnel about the date of his
trial, he became fearful that the government meant to destroy his
family and seize his property. He refused to leave his
mountaintop cabin and did not appear for trial.
Now a "fugitive," Weaver's apprehension fell to the U.S.
Marshal's Service, which came loaded for bear. The marshals
called in military aerial reconnaissance and had photos studied
by the Defense Mapping Agency. They prowled the woods around
Weaver's cabin with night vision equipment. They had
psychological profiles performed and installed $130,000 worth of
solar-powered long-range spy cameras. They intercepted the
Weaver's mail. They even knew the menstrual cycle of weaver's
teenage daughter, and planned an arrest scenario around it. They
actually bought a track of land next to Weaver's where an
undercover marshal was to pose as a neighbor and build a cabin in
hopes of befriending Weaver and luring him away from his cabin.
Although they knew his precise location throughout this elaborate
investigation, not a single marshal ever met face-to-face with
Weaver. Even so, Weaver offered to surrender if conditions were
met to guarantee his safety. The marshals drafted a letter of
acceptance, but the U.S. attorney for Idaho abruptly ordered that
negotiations cease.
On Aug. 21, 1992, Weaver, his son Sammy, 14, and their friend
Kevin Harris, 24, heard the family dog barking. In the woods a
team of six camouflaged marshals armed with fully automatic
assault weapons (one with a silencer) had attracted the dog's
attention. Harris and Sammy followed the dog's bark. The dog had
chased the marshals. At the fork of two abandoned logging roads,
the boys and the marshals met. One of the marshals shot the dog,
and Sammy, in the line of fire, shot back in self defense.
Thee woods erupted with gunsmoke and flying shell casings as the
marshals opened up on the boy, who had by now turned to run home.
One shot struck the rifle he carried, and another hit him
square in the back, killing him instantly. In the melee, Kevin
Harris fired in defense of himself and of Sammy, killing deputy
marshal William Degan.
Two of the remaining marshals made their way to a telephone and
called for help. Within hours the FBI Hostage Rescue Team was in
the air from Virginia and soon thronged the hills above the
Weaver cabin. On the spot the HRT promulgated new rules of
engagement, directing agents to shoot any armed adult male on
sight, whether he posed an immediate threat or not. These rules
violated Idaho law and had never been applied before. They were
not even used in the extraordinary attack on the Branch Davidian
compound at Waco, which took 72 lives.
Late the next day, Weaver, Harris and Weaver's teenage daughter
Sara left the cabin and went to an outbuilding where Sammy's body
lay, washed and prepared for home burial.
Sniper Lon Horiuchi, who testified he could hit a quarter-inch
target at 200 meters, took two shots. The first struck Weaver
under the right arm. The three then rushed back to the cabin,
where Weaver's wife, Vicki, stood holding open the door, with
10-month old Elisheba in her arms. As Harris ran into the open
door Horiuchi shot again, striking Vicki in the head and then
Harris as he passed behind her. Vicki fell dead. Horiuchi
reporting hearing a scream (it was from 10-year-old Rachel) that
lasted at least 30 seconds.
Weaver at last surrendered. He was charged with the sale of the
shotguns and failure to appear at trial, and he and Harris were
charged with Degan's murder, assault on the officers and a
nine-year conspiracy to provoke a confrontation with federal
At trial -- Weaver and Harris were tried together with separate
attorneys -- misconduct on the part of prosecutors led Judge
Edward J. Lodge to assess defense attorney's fees against the
government itself, a step almost unheard of in criminal cases.
Well into the case, the lead prosecutor, who enjoyed a reputation
of punctilious attention to professional responsibilities,
collapsed and was unable to complete the trial. After 40 days of
government testimony, Weaver and harris rested their cases
without calling a single witness. The jury acquitted an all the
substantive charges except for Weaver's failure to appear. With
three human lives and some $3 million down the drain, the U.S.
attorney declined to answer questions from the press.
The ATF, the Marshal's Service, the FBI, even the U.S. attorney,
each had the opportunity to stop this trail of horrors. Because
they saw nothing wrong in any of it, none did. As late in the day
as closing argument, the assistant prosecutor who took over the
sagging case called all this the "honorable" tactics of proper
police work.
Law enforcement has become a sacred cow in America, and it
happened quite naturally. It is comforting to believe that our
thorny problems -- violence, drug abuse, child exploitaton,
public corruption -- can be solved simply by getting tough. And
every year we build more prisons and put more people in them for
longer periods of time.
But consigning our social problems to the criminal justice system
is bad policy for two reasons. First, it won't work. Despite all
the mandatory prison terms, no one seriously argues that the
crime problem is diminishing.
Second, it has disturbing side effects. Overwhelming expense, the
degradation of constitutional protections and the country's
growing sense of frustration and helplessness are a few. The
sorry tale of federal law enforcement run amok in the Weaver case

Hi John.
Actually, they refer to themselves as "SprintLink." ;-)
In all reality, I'm leaving Computer Sciences Corporation for a
consulting position with Mindbank Consulting Group, based in the
Washington, DC area. While CSC has kept me travelling five days
a week (mostly in New Yawk City), I welcome the opportunity to
stay closer to home for a change. (My wife is certainly happier.)
If you turn to page 339 of "The Whole Internet User's Guide & Catalog
(by Ed Krol, copyright 1992, O'Reilly & Associates ),
in the middle of the page you'll see the name of gentleman for whom
I'll be working.
I remain distanced from the controversy surrounding the
Sprint/Congressional-hearing debate, because I do not work there
yet. As far as their reliabilty, I certainly hope to contribute to the
future of Sprint's connectivity reputation; hopefully that will be a
good thing.
Wish me luck, chum.

NIST plans to give Public Key Partners exclusive rights to the Digital Signature Algorithm. Do you want to guarantee your own rights to this technology? You can! It's free, if you can spare a stamp.
Attached is a form letter you can send to NIST to apply for a personal license. Put in your own name, address, country, and the right date; print it out; read through to check it over; sign it; and drop it in the
mail. You don't have to get everything right the first time---NIST will contact you if they need more information to make a decision. And, as a bonus, your application will automatically count as an objection to the NIST-PKP deal!
I believe that NIST must receive your application by next Friday, the
6th of August, but the due date might be earlier. You might want to check immediately with Michael Rubin at 301-975-2803. If necessary you can fax your letter to him.

Dear Mr. Rubin:
I hereby apply for a personal license to use the Digital Signature
1. Title of invention: Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA).
2. Patent Application Serial Number: 07/738.431.
3. United States Patent Number: To be issued as 5,231,668, I believe.
4. Source of information concerning availability of a license: Various sources, including your Federal Register notice.
5. Name and address of applicant: [name], [address, phone, etc.].
6. Applicant's representative: not applicable.
7. I am a [country] citizen.
8. Approximate number of persons employed: not applicable.
9. I am not a small business firm.
10. Purpose: I would like a personal license allowing me to implement and use DSA. See 11. Business and commercialization: not applicable; see 12. Plans: I plan to use DSA to attach digital signatures to a variety
of electronic documents, primarily for authentication. I plan to use DSA
implementations, initially in software but perhaps later in hardware,
from a variety of potential future sources. Investments: I may spend many hours programming a DSA implementation.
                                                                page 2
13. Fields of commercialization: not applicable; see 14. I am not willing to accept a license for less than all fields of use of DSA.
15. I intend to implement and use DSA only in [country].
16. Type of license: I would like a non-exclusive license which does not require royalty payments.
17. I have never been granted a license to a federally owned invention.
18. Known uses of DSA by industry or government: I have heard that ISC sells a product called dsaSIGN, and that Bellcore has implemented DSA.
19. Other information: I understand that NIST may grant an exclusive DSA license to PKP, and that this license application will be treated as an objection to the PKP license.
Please note that PKP has stated its intent to make DSA free for personal
use. Therefore, if NIST grants PKP a license and PKP acts according to its stated intent, there is no harm to anyone if I am granted this
personal license. However, I do not trust PKP to act according to its
stated intent, and I do not want to have to apply for a license from PKP
even if it is royalty-free. So I ask that you grant me a license
Thank you for your kind attention. Please let me know if you need more                                 Sincerely,

Code Warriors
Battling for the Keys to Privacy in the Info Age
by Julian Dibbell
It's difficult enough to say what the Information Age is. let
alone when it began. But if forced to name a starting point, you
could probably do worse than pick the moment the United States
government decided to declare children's drawings contraband.
The time was World War II, and the rationale, as with many of the
U.S. government's more surreal policy decisions, was national
security. Military censors, charged with weeding secret
communications from the international mails, feared the tremulous
lines of toddler art might too easily hide the contours of a
spy-drawn map, and so, rather than examine every grandparent-bound
masterpiece that crossed their desks, they chose to forbid the
public from sending them at all. The censors raised similar
objections to the mailing of crossword puzzles -- who knew what
messages might lurk in their solutions? So crossword puzzles too
were placed on the interdiction list -- as were student
transcripts, postal chess games, song requests phoned into radio
stations, and any floral orders that specified the kind of
flowers to be delivered. Wherever information signified to
unpredictably, too quirkily, too privately, the censors shut down
the flow. And where they couldn't ban outright,, they meddled;
the stamps on letters were routinely rearranged so as to scramble
any coded order; affectionate X's and O's were excised at random;
knitting instructions were held up long enough to produce and
analyze the resulting sweater; and on at least one occasion the
dials were spun on an entire shipment of watches, obliterating
whatever hidden meaning might have resided in the placement of
the hands.
State paranoia has always thrived in wartime, of course, but the
fear of secret writing that gripped the government during World
War II was something novel. Like the war itself, this fear was
total, projecting sinister meaning onto the full spread of
communications -- all the random traces of love and commerce,
study and play, hobbies and enthusiasms, that register a
society's transactions. Taking arms against this entropic haze of
human details and differences, the state got a taste of life in a
world oversaturated with information, the kind of world whose
central challenge is to snatch elusive signals from the jaws of
ever-proliferating noise. Today, we who live increasingly in just
such a world might diagnose the censor's panic response as a
simple, if dramatic, case of information anxiety -- that sinking
sense that buried somewhere in the overwhelming chaos of mediated
data surrounding us lie messages of life-or-death importance. But
back then the panic was something more: it was the premonition of
a dizzying new cultural order on the brink of emergence. It was,
like so many paranoid visions before it, a prophecy.
And a self-fulfilling one at that. For the wartime struggle
against secret communications didn't just envision the
Information Age -- it invented it, in a literal and technological
sense. The world's first digital electronic computer, after all,
was created by Alan Turing and a team of British scientists in
the war's grim early days, for the express and ultimately
successful purpose of cracking the German's key Enigma cipher.
Likewise, Bell engineer Claude Shannon's momentous postwar
discovery of the foundations of information theory -- a
sophisticated mathematical abstraction of the dynamic between
chaos (noise) and intelligibility (signal) in communications
channels -- was directly related to his ground-breaking war work
in cryptology -- the wickedly complex theory and practice of
codes and ciphers. And between computers and the high-speed
networks made possible in part by Shannon's insights, the
necessary tools for the info-saturation of society were in place.
Half a century later, the business pages like to portray the
emergent digital universe as a gift from the Apples and AT&Ts and
Time Warners of the world, brought to you in the name of
efficiency, entertainment, and, above all, profit. But ride the
information superhighway back to its ultimate sources and you end
up in the heat and dust of World War II's secret-code battles.
It's hardly an accident, then, that as the future foreseen in the
censor's cryptophobic nightmares approaches fruition, the code
wars are heating up again. As digital networks have evolved, the
technology of secrecy has evolved along with them, and just like
the computers that populate those networks, it has gotten
radically personal. Thanks to advances in practical cryptography,
anyone who wants it now has the ability to scramble their
communications into a digital hash readable by no one but the
intended recipient -- and increasing numbers of commercial and
individual computer user do want it. No longer the exclusive
domain of soldiers and diplomats, automated encryption systems so
powerful no government can break them now fit snugly into
software easily installed on any home computer. If the spread of
civilian encryption continues unabated, the day may soon come
when wiretap-addicted law-enforcers and the deep-dished
eavesdroppers in the National Security Agency find themselves
stripped forever of their accustomed power to penetrate the noise
the rest of us make just to talk to each other.
Terrified once again of an information landscape pregnant with
unreadable messages, the government is moving to head off this
new bad dream before it becomes a reality. On April 16 of this
year, the Clinton administration announced the development (by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology, with
"guidance" from the NSA's tight-lipped code-breaking gurus) of an
encrypting microchip designed for use in telephones, powerful
enough to thwart most intruders but rigged so that cops and other
warranted government agents can tap in to the encrypted
communications at will.
The White House presented the new system (code-named Clipper -- a
chip for computer modems, called Capstone, is soon to follow) as
a Solomonic compromise between the growing demand for
communications privacy and "the legitimate needs of law
enforcement," but its effect so far has been anything but
pacifying. Clipper's announcement brought to boil a
long-simmering battle between the state security establishment
and an accidental confederacy of high-tech business interests,
civil libertarians, and guerrilla cryptographers. It's been
blazing openly ever since, in online discussion groups, in
congressional committee groups, in the pages of The New York
Times, The Washington Post, Newsweek, and a slew of computer
trade magazines, with the Clipper chip at its center but with
much more than the fate of a cleverly etched silicon wafer at
stake. "The future of privacy in America" might best sum up the
usual understanding of what the fight is about, but even that
phrase seems inadequate given how far the warp-speed evolution of
information technology is stretching the very meaning of privacy.
Better, then, to say simply that if secret codes tell us where
the Information Age began, they may also hold an answer to the
difficult question of what it is. Or even, perhaps, to the still
more challenging one of what it could be.
"You can get further away in cyberspace than you could in going
to Alpha Centauri," says Tim May, and he should know. Before he
retired seven years ago, a wealthy man at age 34, May was a
reasonably illustrious corporate physicist. Now he's a
Cypherpunk, part of a loose-knit band of scrappy,
libertarian-leaning computer jockeys who have dedicated
themselves to perfecting  and promoting the art of disappearing
into the virtual hinterlands. Concentrated in Silicon Valley but
spread out across the country and as far away as Finland, the
Cypherpunks maintain daily e-mail contact, collaboratively
creating and distributing practical software answers to modern
cryptography's central question: How to wrap a piece of digital
information in mathematical complexity so dense only literally
astronomical expenditures of computer time can breach it?
"Some of these things sound like just a bunch of fucking
numbers," May explains. "But what they really are is they're
things which in computability space take more energy to get to
than to drive a car to Andromeda. I'm not kidding. I mean, you
can work the math out yourself."
Well no, you probably can't, but even those unversed in rocket
science can appreciate the social value of such calculations. As
computer-driven technology comes more and more to mediate
people's connections to society -- and as computers grow in their
abilities to store and sift the information generated by those
connections -- it gets harder for individuals to escape the
prying attentions of state and corporate bureaucracies. Medical
records, credit histories, spending patterns, life stories --
these are being swept up by the millions into a massively
connected web of chatty, chip-laden consumer toys and
institutional data factories, all of them potential informers on
the individuals whose lives pass through them. With every new
info-tech plaything that shows up under society's Christmas tree,
the hydra-headed surveillance machine moves in a little closer,
snuggling up to our skin and our wallets and intensifying the
urge to flee, to find a far-off, secret place to hide in.
Cryptography's power to carve such places out of the very
structure of cyberspace is its obvious selling point -- and
further evidence of computers; textbook-dialectical tendency to
offer liberatory solutions for every oppressive situation they
create. Yet, while the privacy afforded by cryptography seems to
be the main reason the Cypherpunks gather in its name, not all of
them see privacy as an end in itself. The most farsighted see it
as a beginning, a first step toward reshaping society in the
image of computer networks themselves: decentralized, fluid,
fault-tolerant, a fuzzy, nonhierarchical unity of autonomous
"Cryptography is a greater equalizer than the Colt .45, " says
Eric Hughes, the long-haired, cowboy-hatted, and not entirely
lapsed Mormon who, along with may, conceived the Cypherpunks just
seven months before the Clipper hit the fan. "These are
power-leveling techniques," he adds, pointing out that the
hermetically sealed voice-and-data channels that could arm every
citizen against state wire-surveillance are just the simplest of
the crypto toys the Cypherpunks are playing with. Anonymous
remailers are another -- labyrinths of forwarding computers
through which encoded e-mail messages bounce, confounding any
attempt to trace them back to their sources and thus providing an
impenetrable anonymity ideal for whistleblowers and other
transgressors of local codes of silence, from Mafia turncoats to
isolated members od stigmatized sexual minorities. Building on
encryption and remailers, experimental digital cash schemes test
the possibility of untraceable electronic transactions, the basic
ingredient for unregulated worldwide information markets, where a
brisk commerce in trade secrets could spell doom for the
corporation as we know it. Hopelessly untaxable, such
crypto-markets, if they grew large enough, could also critically
sap the economic strength of governments. All of these mechanism,
then, conjured into existence by myriad small desires for simple
privacy, would tend on a large scale to siphon power away from
the huge, impersonal concentrations it likes to gather in. Five
years ago Tim May came up with a name for this vision of a
networked society brought to the brink of ungovernability by the
ubiquity of secret codes. He calls it "crypto-anarchy."
The U.S. government, on the other hand, has not yet dared call
it treason, but its Clipper maneuver does appear to be a step in
that direction. Hughes' comparison of encryption to firearms is
one of the Cypherpunks; favorite rhetorical moves, but for the
feds, cryptography's status as weaponry is more than a metaphor

              A LETTER FROM THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS LABORATORY                                        August 1993 TRACKING DEVELOPMENTS IN TRUSTED SYSTEMS
The 16th National Computer Security Conference, to be held
September 20-23, 1993, at the Baltimore Convention Center, will
dedicate a full track to Information Technology (IT) Security
Criteria and Evaluation.  The track will expand on the
collaborative effort between the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to
develop a security criteria document suitable for use by both government and industry.  The objectives are to enhance the
development and evaluation of IT products with security features
and to develop an extensible and flexible framework for defining
new requirements for IT security products that will be used by
the international IT community.
The new track will focus on IT security criteria efforts over the
last year.  An introduction to the Federal Criteria will be
followed by tutorials on protection profile development and the
potential ways in which profiles may be reviewed and registered
for use by product developers, customers, and evaluators.  Other
panel discussions will include a comparison of the current
evaluation processes in North America and Europe and a report on
the status and plans for a commercial security evaluation process
in the U.S.
The track will also feature a panel discussion on a new
international project to develop common IT security criteria that
will align existing national criteria.  NIST and NSA officials
announced the project during the Federal Criteria Invitational
Workshop, held on June 2-3, 1993.  The project is a joint
activity of the governments of the U.S., Canada, and European
nations.  Six government IT security officials from these nations
have formed the Common Criteria Editorial Board (CCEB). Presenting their perspectives, CCEB panel members will describe
their work, the starting documents, and the timetable for planned
draft criteria, review, and trial use periods.
Ellen Flahavin, coordinator for the Criteria and Evaluation
track, expects IT professionals from around the world to attend
these sessions.  For specific information on the track, contact
Ellen at NIST, Computer Systems Laboratory, POLY A241,
Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001, telephone (301) 975-3871.  For
general information on the computer security conference, see the
Upcoming Technical Conferences section of the newsletter.  We
welcome your participation in the 16th National Computer Security
Conference and look forward to seeing you at the Baltimore
Convention Center at the Inner Harbor in September.
FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARDS (FIPS) ACTIVITIES
Secure Hash Standard Approved for Federal Agency Use
On May 11, 1993, the Secretary of Commerce approved FIPS 180,
Secure Hash Standard, for use by federal agencies in protecting
unclassified information that is not subject to section 2315 of
Title 10, United States Code, or section 3502(2) of Title 44,
United States Code.  To be effective October 15, 1993, FIPS 180
specifies a Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) which can be used to
generate a condensed representation of a message called a message
digest.  The SHA is required for use with the planned Digital
Signature Algorithm (DSA) and whenever a secure hash algorithm is
required for federal applications.  Private and commercial
organizations are encouraged to adopt and use the standard.
The SHA is used by both the transmitter and intended receiver of
a message in computing and verifying a digital signature. Appropriate applications of the SHA include electronic mail,
electronic funds transfer, software distribution, data storage,
and other applications which require data integrity assurance and
data origin authentication.  The SHA may be implemented in
software, firmware, hardware, or any combination. Implementations
of the SHA will be validated by NIST. Secretary of Commerce Approves POSIX Revision
FIPS 151-1, POSIX:  Portable Operating System Interface for
Computer Environments, has been revised to adopt International
Standard ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990, Information Technology--Portable
Operating System Interface (POSIX)--Part 1:  System Application
Program Interface (API) [C Language] which defines a C
programming language source interface to an operating system
environment.  Effective October 15, 1993, the revised standard
will be published as FIPS 151-2 and supersedes FIPS 151-1 in its
entirety.  FIPS 151-2 will maximize the federal return on
investment in generating or purchasing computer programs by
enhancing operating system compatibility.
Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) Standard Revised
The Secretary of Commerce approved a revision to FIPS 128, CGM,
which will be published as FIPS 128-1.  The revised standard
adopts the redesignated version of the CGM standard known as
ANSI/ISO 8632.1-4:1992; adds a requirement for the use of
profiles which define the options, elements, and parameters of
ANSI/ISO 8632 necessary to accomplish a particular function and
to maximize the probability of interchange between systems
implementing the profile; and adopts the first such profile, the
military specification MIL-D-28003A, November 15, 1991, known as
the CALS (Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistic Support) CGM
Application Profile.
FIPS 128-1 is a graphics data interface standard which specifies
a file format suitable for the description, storage, and
communication of graphical (pictorial) information in a device-
independent manner.  The standard facilitates the transfer of
graphical information between different graphical software
systems, different graphical devices, and different computer
graphics installations.
The revised standard becomes effective October 15, 1993.  The use
of the CGM Application Profile is mandatory October 15, 1994.  We
encourage agencies to use the application profile in acquisitions
initiated during this period.
Revision of FIPS for Database Language SQL
On May 12, 1993, the Secretary of Commerce approved a substantial
enhancement of FIPS 127-1, SQL.  Effective December 3, 1993, the
revised standard will be published as FIPS 127-2 and replaces
FIPS 127-1 in its entirety.  FIPS 127-2 is mandatory for all
federal procurements of relational model database management
systems.  The revised SQL standard adds significant new features
for schema definition, diagnostics management, integrity
constraints, and international character set support, as well as
new data types, new table operations, and enhanced data
manipulation expressions.  A new Information Schema makes all
schema data available to applications.
FIPS 127-2 is specified in four separate conformance levels: Entry SQL, Transitional SQL, Intermediate SQL, and Full SQL. Although only Entry SQL is required, initially, for conformance
to FIPS 127-2, a higher conformance level may be specified as
mandatory in individual agency procurements.  The NIST SQL Test
Suite, Version 4.0, provides conformance tests for the Entry SQL
level of FIPS 127-2.  Future versions of the test suite will
evaluate other FIPS SQL conformance levels.  We invite you to
call Joan Sullivan on (301) 975-3258 for order information on the
NIST SQL Test Suite.  Input/Output Interface Standards Withdrawn
Effective May 11, 1993, eight FIPS have been withdrawn because
the technical specifications that they adopt are obsolete and are
no longer supported by industry.  The standards include:

were embarrassed by the Intergraph correlation in the "Clipper"
moniker, so they just casually started calling it something else
As far as I'm concerned, it's still the MYK-78 and "Capstone" is still
MYK-80. It sounds more militaristic, which is in keeping with the image
of a Gestapo dictatorship.

Accused of Failing to Protect Data, IRS Says It Will Buttress
by Stephen Barr
Washington Post Staff Writer
The Internal revenue Service, assailed by senators yesterday over
a breakdown in computer security that allowed IRS workers to
browse through tax records and monitor fraudulent tax refunds,
pledged to strengthen safeguards set up to ensure taxpayer
records are kept confidential.
"it's not easy. it's painful to admit mistakes you make,"
Internal revenue Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson said
after listening to members of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee express outrage that IRS workers abused their public
Addressing committee Chairman John Glenn (D-Ohio), Richardson
said,"I feel very strongly about protecting the integrity of the
tax system, and I told you we will not tolerate anything that
will impinge on that integrity or the credibility of the American
But Richardson rebuffed a suggestion by Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.)
that the IRS notify the taxpayers whose files were improperly
reviewed. "I'm not sure there would be a serious value to that in
terms of tax administration or in the connection with what I see
as protecting the taxpayer's rights," she said.
Pryor said he would continue to press for taxpayer notification,
saying, "I'm going to really come down hard.... I think anyone
that we can identify whose files have been browsed for no
official reason, I think that taxpayer needs to know."
Richardson's testimony followed the release of a report this week
that showed almost 370 IRS employees in the agency's Southeast
Region have been investigated or disciplined for creating
fraudulent tax returns or browsing through tax returns of
friends, relatives, neighbors and celebrities.
In 154 cases, employees were disciplined. Deputy Commissioner
Michael P. Dolan said three employees were forced to resign,
three were fired, 38 received suspensions, 67 were given
reprimands, 24 were admonished, 17 underwent counseling and two
received "caution letters."
Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), noting that few employees were
dismissed, questioned Richardson and Dolan on whether "we are
dealing appropriately enough" with violators. They said the IRS
would provide the committee with detailed information on how
disciplinary judgements were made.
Few details emerged at the hearing on how IRS regional employees
created bogus refunds. An IRS investigative report released by
the committee said that four employees are facing criminal
"In one case," the IRS report said, "an employee prepared over
200 fraudulent tax returns and monitored the refunds" on IRS
computers. The report suggested that the fake refunds cost the
government more than $300,000.
In another case, "the employee used her position to input
fraudulent adjustments and monitor the accounts of local
taxpayers. She also prepared fraudulent returns, including
returns for herself and her parents," the IRS report said.
Dolan noted that the violations ranged from the serious to the
benign, such as employees who were asked by neighbors for a
favor: determine the status of their income tax refund.
In answering questions, Richardson pointed out that IRS's
internal audit staff had uncovered the information with the
General Accounting Office. The IRS audit examined the Integrated
Data Retrieval System, a database of taxpayer accounts used by
56,000 IRS workers nationwide.
Richardson said the IRS is developing a "comprehensive review" of
computer security issues that will improve the agency's ability
to detect "inappropriate use."
The IRS also is reviewing its high-risk operations, such as
credit transfers amd taxpayer adjustments, in a renewed effort tp
avert employee misconduct. Dolan said a review of the agency's
most sensitive computer commands would be completed within the
next six weeks.
Richardson was a washington tax attorney before being selected
earlier this year by President Clinton to run the IRS. Dolan, a
career civil servant, was named deputy commissioner last year.

A old friend of mine sent me an e-mail this afternoon; it appears
we see eye-to-eye on this entire fiasco -- and the dangerous role
the government wants to play in the Information Age:
8<--------- forwarded message --------------
Saw your recent posting on SCI.CRYPT.  I generally shun public postings in such an arena. . . .
However, it occurred to me, with only a little bit of thought, that after
the recent articles in the Washington Post regarding the employee's of
the IRS browsing through friends, enemies, and famous folk's 1040's --
simply for kicks -- how would this be any different than an escrow key
Isn't it simply a given truth that if one man can view a personal secret
of another, that he will be tempted?  And let's face it, history proves
that, more often than not, the "apple is bitten," ---- or at least "nibbled."  No matter how you work it, there will always be a small perhaps even one, that will have access to your key.  Just like that girl that sits behind the faceless terminal can pull up my 1040 and run
through the schedules to see what I won on and what I lost ---- and I'll
never know that it even happened.  Of course, until someone who shouldn't
know does know, and perhaps at a cocktail party makes mention. . . . . Small potatoes. . . .   but not if you're encrypting..

@_subject: NIST contact information 
For anyone interested, this text was excerpted from the Computer
Systems Laboratory (CSL) Bulletin for July 1993, entitled, "Connecting
to the Internet: Security Considerations." Ironically, one paragraph
specifically states the admitted security concerns for unencrypted
 "Ease of Spying and Spoofing:  The vast majority of Internet traffic
 is unencrypted and therefore easily readable.  As a result, e-mail,
 passwords, and file transfers can be monitored and captured using
 readily available software.  Intruders have been known to monitor
 connections to well-known Internet sites for the purpose of gaining
 information that would allow them to crack security or to steal
 valuable information.  This information sometimes permits intruders
 to spoof legitimate connections, i.e., trick system security into
 permitting normally disallowed network connections."
Surprisingly, the article also acknowledges the mind-boggling growth
of the Internet in a statement that says, "Consequently, the Internet
is now growing faster than any telecommunications system thus far,
including the telephone system." With that in mind, the "key-ecrow"
system is, in my opinion, just the beginning in a systemmatic
approach which I believe the NSA and the Justice Department will
attempt to entrench in their ever-elusive "War on Drugs" (WoD), etc.
This may become even more sinister in that the RICO statutes may
empower them with the ability to effectively eavesdrop at will,
monitoring voice and data communications in the shadows.
This file is on the NIST's publicly available system as
JUL93BLT.TXT. Other reports, announcements and bulletins are available
on their system which may be of interest to you. Information about how
to connect to the system is included below:
 "NIST maintains a computer security bulletin board system (BBS)
 and Internet-accessible site for computer security information open
 to the public at all times.  These resources provide information on
 computer security publications, CSL Bulletins, alert notices,
 information about viruses and anti-virus tools, a security events
 calendar, and sources for more information.
 To access the BBS, you need a computer with communications
 capability and a modem.  For modems at 2400 bits per second (BPS)
 or less, dial (301) 948-5717.  For 9600 BPS, dial (301) 948-5140.
 Modem settings for all speeds are 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop
 bit.
 Internet users with telnet or ftp capability may telnet to the BBS
 at cs-bbs.nist.gov (129.6.54.30).  To download files, users need to
 use ftp as follows:  ftp to csrc.nist.gov (129.6.54.11), log into
 account anonymous, use your Internet address as the password, and
 locate files in directory pub; an index of all files is available
 for download.  For users with Internet-accessible e-mail
 capability, send e-mail to docserver with the
 following message:  send filename, where filename is the name of
 the file you wish to retrieve.  send index will return an index of
 available files."

Today's "Notable quote" -
"... I have to say up front I don't speak for the CIA and this
is just me.  I can tell you I did my doctoral work studying
Soviet-East European personal computing.  I have seen export
controls and all that close at hand, and actually kicked the
tires and things and all that.  I can say I agreed nearly
100% with what Mr. Diffie said, up until he said something
that surprised me, in that this room didn't shout it down.
That was when he said information is less dangerous than
physical things.  Good God! If you believe that, I'll give
you a choice.  I can go to your school district and give out
one hit of PCP, or I can cover the area with instructions on
how to make it.  All I'd ask you to keep in mind is to have
some sympathy for the foreign policy-niks who know that, in a
sort of frustrated air, when it's hard to move information
around, it's unlikely that someone can even get an atomic
bomb plan, despite the fact that we've got tens of thousands
in both the former Soviet Union and in the United States.
But I would fear someone giving out the Princeton
dissertation and broadcasting it over the nets to all and
sundry in that form -- now, given plutonium, we can make a
bomb.  So, information is a dangerous thing, in the right
hands.  I think we're all selling ourselves short if we think
information is an unempowered commodity.
All that said, I have to agree with everything else.
Cryptography is not magic, it's math, and DES is not only
here, it's on a server in Helsinki, so we have to live with
the fact that information moves around.  We may want to be
sympathetic to the fact that there are people, in fact people
without the tools that we all have here, trying to enact the
current and past foreign policy.  Help educate them, help
tell them why these things are happening, but realize that
we're disrupting a lot of things real fast."

ser's knowledge. In doing
this, it violates the integrity of the system and furthermore, it does
it surreptitiously. Personally, I like to be intamately aware of every
byte on each of my systems (I am) and know _exactly_ what every
executable which resides on my system does (again, I do). For users
who cannot know this, then a virus is a breech of their privacy, in a
matter of speaking.
Finally, distributed computing need not be accomplished by something
as brain-damaged as a virus. Anything a virus could beneficially do, a
legitimate, non-replicating program can do better. In fact, there have
been viruses designed and coded which were supposed to perform
beneficial activities (see historical notes about the Denzuko, Ohio,
etc. viruses). Also, every virus harbors the potential for damage. No
programmer (read: virus author) can possibly know each and every
environment where the code will be introduced. An example which I
frequently use to illustrate this point is the Stoned virus; it is
mostly an innocuous virus, however with several spoofing disk
partitioning schemes (such as Disk Mangler), it can devastating. And
with the advent of the Microsoft Doublspace shit, alot of other
potholes in the road are introduced into the possible scenarios.
A final note: There is a virus called "Cruncher" which compresses
executables in much the same way as PKLite or LZEXE. Is this a "good"
virus? This ia an exercise left to the reader...

Call for Clipper Comments
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued a request for public comments on its proposal to establish the "Skipjack" key-escrow system as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS).  The deadline for the submission of comments is September 28, 1993.  The full text of the NIST notice CPSR is urging all interested individuals and organizations to express their views on the proposal and to submit comments directly to NIST.  Comments need not be lengthy or very detailed; all thoughtful statements addressing a particular concern will likely contribute to NIST's evaluation of the key-escrow proposal.  The following points could be raised about the NIST proposal
(additional materials on Clipper and the key escrow proposal may be found at the CPSR ftp site, cpsr.org):
* The potential risks of the proposal have not been assessed and many questions about the implementation remain unanswered.  The NIST notice states that the current proposal "does not include identification of key escrow agents who will hold the keys for the key escrow microcircuits or the procedures for access to the keys."  The key escrow configuration may also create a dangerous vulnerability in a communications network.  The risks of misuse of this feature should be weighed against any perceived benefit.
* The classification of the Skipjack algorithm as a "national security" matter is inappropriate for technology that will be used primarily in civilian and commercial applications.  Classification of technical information also limits the computing community's ability to evaluate fully the proposal and the general public's right to know about the activities of government.
* The proposal was not developed in response to a public concern or a business request.  It was put forward by the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation so that these two agencies could continue surveillance of electronic communications. It has not been established that is necessary for crime prevention.  The number of arrests resulting from wiretaps has remained essentially unchanged since the federal wiretap law was enacted in 1968.
* The NIST proposal states that the escrow agents will provide the key components to a government agency that "properly demonstrates legal authorization to conduct electronic surveillance of communications which are encrypted."  The crucial term "legal authorization" has not been defined.  The vagueness of the term "legal authorization" leaves open the possibility that court-
issued warrants may not be required in some circumstances.  This issue must be squarely addressed and clarified. * Adoption of the proposed key escrow standard may have an adverse impact upon the ability of U.S. manufacturers to market cryptographic products abroad.  It is unlikely that non-U.S. users would purchase communication security products to which the U.S. government holds keys.

Notice; request for comments.
SUMMARY: A Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for an Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) is being proposed. This proposed standard specifies use of a symmetric-key encryption/decryption algorithm and a key escrowing method which are to be implemented in electronic devices and used for protecting certain unclassified government communications when such protection is required. The algorithm and the key escrowing method are classified and are referenced, but not specified, in the standard.
   This proposed standard adopts encryption technology developed by the Federal government to provide strong protection for unclassified information and to enable the keys used in the encryption and decryption processes to be escrowed. This latter feature will assist law enforcement and other government agencies, under the proper legal authority, in the collection and decryption of electronically transmitted information. This proposed standard does not include identification of  key escrow  agents who will hold the keys for the  key escrow  microcircuits or the procedures for access to the keys. These issues will be addressed by the Department of Justice.
   The purpose of this notice is to solicit views from the public, manufacturers, and Federal, state, and local government users so that their needs can be considered prior to submission of this proposed standard to the Secretary of Commerce for review and    The proposed standard contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with the technical aspects of the standard. Both sections are provided in this DATES: Comments on this proposed standard must be received on or before September 28, 1993.
ADDRESSES: Written comments concerning the proposed standard should be sent to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN: Proposed FIPS for Escrowed Encryption Standard, Technology Building, room B-154, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
   Written comments received in response to this notice will be made part of the public record and will be made available for inspection and copying in the Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW., Washington, DC 20230.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Dennis Branstad, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975-2913.
   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed FIPS implements the initiative announced by the White House Office of the Press Secretary on April 16, 1993. The President of the U.S. approved a Public Encryption Management directive, which among other actions, called for standards to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted with  key-escrow  microcircuits in Federal communication systems that process sensitive, but unclassified information.

 Announcing the Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES)
   Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to section 111(d) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.
 Name of Standard: Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES).
 Category of Standard: Telecommunications Security.
 Explanation: This Standard specifies use of a symmetric-key encryption (and decryption) algorithm and a Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF) creation method (one part of a  key escrow  system) which provide for decryption of encrypted telecommunications when interception of the telecommunications is lawfully authorized. Both the algorithm and the LEAF creation method are to be implemented in electronic devices (e.g., very large scale integration chips). The devices may be incorporated in security equipment used to encrypt (and decrypt) sensitive unclassified telecommunications data. Decryption of lawfully intercepted telecommunications may be achieved through the acquisition and use of the LEAF, the decryption algorithm and escrowed key components.
   To escrow something (e.g., a document, an encryption key) means that it is "delivered to a third person to be given to the grantee only upon the fulfillment of a condition" (Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary). A key escrow  system is one that entrusts components of a key used to encrypt telecommunications to third persons, called key component escrow agents. In accordance with the common definition of "escrow", the key component escrow agents provide the key components to a "grantee" (i.e., a government agency) only upon fulfillment of the condition that the grantee properly demonstrates legal authorization to conduct electronic surveillance of communications which are encrypted using the specific device whose key component is requested. The key components obtained through this process are then used by the grantee to reconstruct the device unique key and obtain the session key (contained in the LEAF) which is used to decrypt the telecommunications that are encrypted with that device. The term, "escrow", for purposes of this standard, is restricted to the dictionary definition.
   The encryption/decryption algorithm has been approved for government applications requiring encryption of sensitive unclassified telecommunications of data as defined herein. The specific operations of the algorithm and the LEAF creation method are classified and hence are referenced, but not specified, in this standard.
   Data, for purposes of this standard, includes voice, facsimile and computer information communicated in a telephone system. Telephone system, for purposes of this standard, is limited to systems circuit-switched up to no more than 14.4 kbs or which use basic-rate ISDN, or to a similar grade wireless service.
   Data that is considered sensitive by a responsible authority should be encrypted if it is vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure during telecommunications. A risk analysis should be performed under the direction of a responsible authority to determine potential threats and risks. The costs of providing encryption using this standard as well as alternative methods and their respective costs should be projected. A responsible authority should then make a decision, based on the risk and cost analyses, whether or not to use encryption and then whether or not to use this standard.
 Approving Authority: Secretary of Commerce.
 Maintenance Agency: Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology.
 Applicability: This standard is applicable to all Federal departments and agencies and their contractors under the conditions specified below. This standard may be used in designing and implementing security products and systems which Federal departments and agencies use or operate or which are operated for them under contract. These products may be used when replacing Type II and Type III (DES) encryption devices and products owned by the government and government contractors.
   This standard may be used when the following conditions apply:
   1. An authorized official or manager responsible for data security or the security of a computer system decides that encryption is required and cost justified as per OMB Circular A-
130; and
   2. The data is not classified according to the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
   However, Federal departments or agencies which use encryption devices for protecting data that is classified according to either of these acts may use those devices also for protecting unclassified data in lieu of this standard.
   In addition, this standard may be adopted and used by non-
Federal Government organizations. Such use is encouraged when it provides the desired security.
Applications: Devices conforming to this standard may be used for protecting unclassified communications.
 Implementations: The encryption/decryption algorithm and the LEAF creation method shall be implemented in electronic devices (e.g., electronic chip packages) that can be physically protected against unauthorized entry, modification and reverse engineering. Implementations which are tested and validated by NIST will be considered as complying with this standard. An electronic device shall be incorporated into a cyptographic module in accordance with FIPS 140-1. NIST will test for conformance with FIPS 140-1. Cryptographic modules can then be integrated into security equipment for sale and use in an application. Information about devices that have been validated, procedures for testing equipment for conformance with NIST standards, and information about obtaining approval of security equipment are available from the Computer Systems Laboratory, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
 Export Control: Implementations of this standard are subject to Federal Government export controls as specified in title 22, Code of Federal Regulations, parts 120 through 131 (International Traffic of Arms Regulations -ITAR). Exporters of encryption devices, equipment and technical data are advised to contact the U.S. Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls for more information.   Patents: Implementations of this standard may be covered by U.S. and foreign patents.
 Implementation Schedule: This standard becomes effective thirty days following publication of this FIPS PUB.

 Specifications for the Escrowed Encryption Standard
 1. Introduction
   This publication specifies Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) functions and parameters.
 2. General
   This standard specifies use of the SKIPJACK cryptographic algorithm and the LEAF Creation Method 1 (LCM-1) to be implemented in an approved electronic device (e.g., a very large scale integration electronic chip). The device is contained in a logical cryptographic module which is then integrated in a security product for encrypting and decrypting telecommunications.
   Approved implementations may be procured by authorized organizations for integration into security equipment. Devices must be tested and validated by NIST for conformance to this standard. Cryptographic modules must be tested and validated by NIST for conformance to FIPS 140-1.
 3. Algorithm Specifications
   The specifications of the encryption/decryption algorithm (SKIPJACK) and the LEAF Creation Method 1 (LCM-1) are classified. The National Security Agency maintains these classified specifications and approves the manufacture of devices which implement the specifications. NIST tests for conformance of the devices implementing this standard in cryptographic modules to FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 81.
 4. Functions and Parameters
 4.1 Functions
   The following functions, at a minimum, shall be implemented:
   1. Data Encryption: A session key (80 bits) shall be used to encrypt plaintext information in one or more of the following modes of operation as specified in FIPS 81: ECB, CBC, OFB (64) CFB (1, 8, 16, 32, 64).
   2. Data Decryption: The session key (80 bits) used to encrypt the data shall be used to decrypt resulting ciphertext to obtain the data.
   3.  Key Escrow:  The Family Key (KF) shall be used to create the Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF) in accordance with the LEAF Creation Method 1 (LCM-1). The Session Key shall be encrypted with the Device Unique Key and transmitted as part of the LEAF. The security equipment shall ensure that the LEAF is transmitted in such a manner that the LEAF and ciphertext may be decrypted with legal authorization. No additional encryption or modification of the LEAF is permitted.
 4.2 Parameters
   The following parameters shall be used in performing the prescribed functions:
   1. Device Identifier (DID): The identifier unique to a particular device and used by the  Key Escrow  System.
   2. Device Unique Key (KU): The cryptographic key unique to a particular device and used by the  Key Escrow  System.
   3. Cryptographic Protocol Field (CPF): The field identifying the registered cryptographic protocol used by a particular application and used by the  Key Escrow  System (reserved for future specification and use).
   4. Escrow Authenticator (EA): A binary pattern that is inserted in the LEAF to ensure that the LEAF is transmitted and received properly and has not been modified, deleted or replaced in an unauthorized manner.
   5. Initialization Vector (IV): A mode and application dependent vector of bytes used to initialize, synchronize and verify the encryption, decryption and key escrow  functions.
   6. Family Key (KF): The cryptographic key stored in all devices designated as a family that is used to create the LEAF.
   7. Session Key (KS): The cryptographic key used by a device to encrypt and decrypt data during a session.    8. Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF): The field containing the encrypted session key and the device identifier and the escrow  5. Implementation
   The Cryptographic Algorithm and the LEAF Creation Method shall be implemented in an electronic device (e.g., VLSI chip) which is highly resistant to reverse engineering (destructive or non-
destructive) to obtain or modify the cryptographic algorithms, the DID, the KF, the KU, the EA, the CPF, the operational KS, or any other security or  Key Escrow  System relevant information. The device shall be able to be programmed/personalized (i.e., made unique) after mass production in such a manner that the DID, KU (or its components), KF (or its components) and EA fixed pattern can be entered once (and only once) and maintained without external electrical power.
   The LEAF and the IV shall be transmitted with the ciphertext. The specifics of the protocols used to create and transmit the LEAF, IV, and encrypted data shall be registered and a CPF assigned. The CPF shall then be transmitted in accordance with the registered specifications.
   The specific electric, physical and logical interface will vary with the implementation. Each approved, registered implementation shall have an unclassified electrical, physical and logical interface specification sufficient for an equipment manufacturer to understand the general requirements for using the device. Some of the requirements may be classified and therefore would not be specified in the unclassified interface specification.

"Cypherpunks write code" should be expanded (in fact, it -is-

non-beneificial software. But what delineates the two?
This is a -very- touchy subject.
"Subversive software," is a term which I use to demonstrate the
properties of software which spoofs someone, in one way or another.
Viruses do this, especially what we call "stealth" viruses, because of
their ability to spoof the operating system.
"Subversive software," in the terminolgy of KOH may be something else
entirely, but any software that marks sectors bad on my disks without
my permission automatically falls into the clssification of "unwanted"
or "bad" software.
Perhaps I don't understand or haven't familiarized myself enough with
this software, but it sounds ominously like some timebomb which
harbors the potential to hose the user at any given time.
IMHO, this sounds like badware, but I would have to examine it
further, under a debugger.
Firstly, by not jumping the gun.
Secondly, by examining the software extensively.
Thirdly, by making an honest analysis of its merits, its pitfalls and
its contentions.
All in all, if all it does is actively encrypt and compress, then it
is certainly non-threatening to the general public. If it does
otherwise, or has some odd caveats, the it needs to be advertised "up
Now, don't get ne wrong -- I don't condone someone posting a debug
script on the net and saying "This may hose your system," knowing full
well that it will do exactly that!

how do you add an AKA to your key? I skimmed through the

something, but didn't see this mentioned. I have, however, seen it
done and have a couple on my keyring in fact.

 Sure, they have a backdoor -- it's called unsecured ports and

 Cisco routers don't really have "TCP" ports, per se. They have
 ethernet ports, or token ring ports, v.35 serial ports, and
 dial-up rs-232 for fail-safe configuration when some idiot drops
 your feed at the local rboc and you need to "look into" your net.
 If the "entrance" passwords are enabled properly, then I feel quite
 sure that this threat is minimal. However, I have learned recently
 that some facets of SNMP encapsulation can exploit _management_ but
 can not, however exploit the configuration of the router. It can add
 to the traffic overhead.
 Also, there is an additional "enable" password for configuration
 modification, such as changing IP addresses of the ethernet or serial
 interfaces (ports) and saving the configuration to NVRAM.
 I had a guy adamantly try to convince me the other day that the
 (Cisco) routers were in jeopardy because of the ability to TFTP
 a new (albeit, damaging) operating system directly into NVRAM
 (a sleight of hand), rendering the box useless. It can be done,
 in fact, Cisco would have to ship me a whole new box overnight
 if it happened, but if I mind my P's and Q's (read: adhere to
 proper security), he's pissin' in the wind.

Let's be realistic, Mike.
The biggest threat to any security, on any basis, is the threat of
human nature. The chances of someone factoring your PGP encoded
message is somewhere in the range of slim-to-none, but the chances
of someone (you) -physically- compromising their key is much, much
In fact, I'd venture to say that it's much higher than even you or I
imagine, given the fact that some folks ignore what most of us would
deem common sense and use PGP on a multi-user system (such as a SUN
server, any other UNIX-flavored workstation, or even a Netware
Fact Two: That's why you won't see messages from me either (a.)
signed with PGP, or (b.) encrypted with PGP from any of my other
e-mail accounts. All are UNIX (open) environments and I don't like
the implications of the possibilities of my secret key being exposed,
even if I do trust the folks I work with. Call me a schizoid.

The Hunt for Red Miata
A Glimpse at the New Indutrial-Espionage CIA,
by David Corn
  "Economic intelligence is the hottest current topic in intelligence
   poilcy." - CIA Director R. James Woolsey
  The President slammed the files down on the desk and glared
across the Oval Office to his national security advisors.
"Intelligence reports from the NSA," he huffed, "tell us that
Volkswagen is about to introduce a sports coupe with room for
passengers in the back, air bags in front and rear, zero to 60 in
6.8, over 50 mpg, retailing for less than $12,000, due to a new
employee profit-sharing arrangement. This is intolerable. Detroit
could be driven to its knees. And what's worse is those damn ...
uh, competitors ... are stealing secrets from our companies.
Thank God, one of their design specialists used an unsecured
cellular phone. What are we going to do?"
   Woolsey finished cleaning his glasses with his tie. "Well, Mr.
President," he said, "our sources tell us that all they really
got was GM's plans to market luxury sedans in Japan -- a lot of
good that will do them. But we realize this threat is serious. We
are putting our best officer on the case ..."
   James Ryan was waiting in the hallway outside the Oval Office. He
was still nursing a bad case of eye strain and a touch of R.S.I
from the last operation -- the Toshiba HDTV case. It had ended
badly. Two hackers dead. A Cray was down. And the disks were at
the bottom of the Sea of Japan. As he entered the president's
office, Ryan silently cursed Woolsey for making him attend this
damn dog-and-pony show.
   The president stared at Ryan, a 25-year veteran of the service.
Was this the agency's best man? He wore thick glasses; a plastic
pocket-protector protruded from his shirt pocket. The end of his
belt dangled. "Mr. President," Woolsey explained," he's
   The president clasped his hands together. "Very convincing,
Director," he said. "Just wanted to meet the man upon whom our
economic future as a nation rests. Now that I have, I feel very
comfortable. Make us proud, Mr. Ryan. Get us their secret plans.
By the way, if anyone ever asks, I will disavow any knowledge of
your actions."
   Ryan nodded. "I will erase it."
   First stop was Dusseldorf, an auto trade show. Ryan was following
a marketing exec out of a beerhall -- her gray suit flattered her
long legs -- when the personal fax in his briefcase rang. He
ducked into an alley and read the noncurling document: Go to the
HiTek Cafe in Berlin -- damnit, he hated that smoke-free,
non-alcohol pub -- and await your contact, who will carry a copy
of HyperText Life magazine.
   Ryan was playing with his slide rule when she walked in the
HiTek. Nice, he thought. She sat down next to him and gave the
code signal: "Don't you hate to run out of memory?"
   "With some data," he replied, "you just have to learn to let go."
   Victoria Goodlog, she introduced herself. An American grad
student in design engineering who had received a fellowship to
work in the new, restricted Fahrvergnugen Research Facility. "But
we're on the same team," she added. "You worked with Daddy on the
Greece business, didn't you?"
   "Dirty business, that was," he said. "But we won the Cold War."
   "It killed Daddy."
   "Yes, but he died knowing that the U.S. gold supply was safe and
that he had thwarted another communist plot to rule the world."
   "But now we know Moscow was not even capable of ruling its own
   "Well, sure, hindsight is 20/20 .... So tell me, what's a girl
like you doing in a job like this?"
   Ryan put his hand on her thigh and rubbed the corduroy.
   "Make that 'woman'," she said. "And you don't have to seduce me.
I'm on your side. Let's go back to my hotel. I have condoms."
   Nothing is the same anymore, Ryan thought.
   After a lengthy discussion of their sexual pasts and then
moderately passionate lovemaking, the two ordered Evian from room
service and plotted. "I'll create a power surge to knock out the
computer security system. You'll have a few minutes to copy the
encrypted data file," Goolog said. Ryan like the plan. "What's
your favorite algorithm?" he asked. "Later," she said with a
   The next morning, everything fell into place. Ryan, posing as
a workplace facilitator, gained entry into the lab and cracked the
computer locks. He downloaded the file into his laptop and copied
the plans onto super-high-density diskettes designed by Langley's
techies to look like cough drops. On the way out, he dumped the
computer in a garbage can. It would be untraceable. He
rendezvoused with Goodlog at a virtual-reality arcade.
   As they walked down the Kurfurstendamm, Ryan stopped to fix the
penny in his loafer. "Look at this," Goodlog said as she walked
on. "Somebody must have dropped an experimental Hexium-25050
advance microprocessor chip." She bent doen to pick it up.
   "Don't!" bellowed Ryan. The chip exploded. It was too late.
   He held her in his arms, stroked her short hair, removed her
black-frame glasses. But when he heard the sirens, he dropped her
body to the cold pavement and ran. He didn't look back. His
satellite-signal beeper souded. He ignored it.
   He walked past the Brandenburg Gate. It all used to be much
easier. Back then, he was fighting the Evil Empire to save the
Free World. That was worth taking a bullet for. But why should he
have to face the diabolical security chief of BMW or the goons of
Honda to benefit the dinosaurs of Detroit? He hated the Ford he
owned. No pick-up, lousy handling.
   He thought of Goodlog. Who in Grosse Point would mourn her?
Rather than use the plans to build a better, cheaper car, GM
would probably find a way to sabotage the new VW model. That
might even be his next assignment.
   Ryan tossed the diskettes into a sewer. What would he tell
Woolsey? He looked at the spot where Checkpoint Charlie once
stood. It began to rain. "I know," Ryan muttered to himself.
"I'll say that I ran out of fax paper."
