@_subject: Mandatory sigs 
I would have to agree w/ not REQUIRING digsigs, but flagging posts w/out
them.  I guess that's my write in.

@_subject: PGP on a VAX 
I was wondering what the status of getting PGP compiled on a VAX was.
The academic machine here is a VAX 6540 running VMS 5.5-1.
Of course I avoid it, but I want to spread the good word amongst
the IUP student users.  Any place I can get documentation?

@_subject: HACK - EFH Presents Free PGP Encryption Workshop (fwd) 
Just thought you may be interested in this. Anybody ever hear of this EFH group?  It's nice to see somebody making
PGP a little easier for the average jane/joe end-user-type to use.

: 		     Free Cryptography Workshop:
: 		    How to use Pretty Good Privacy
: 				(PGP)
: 		      presented by Paul Elliott
: 			 14 January 1995 3PM
: : : It has become apparent that the data super highway is not safe. Messages
: traveling the data highway can be hijacked by sinister data interlopers.
: : After six months of unpaid labor, in June, 1991 Philip Zimmermann
: released his controversial freeware program Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).
: Just as Prometheus' liver was eternally chewed by eagles for the crime
: of bringing fire to mankind, Philip Zimmermann's liver is now being
: chewed by the Federal Eagle (The U.S. Custom Service) for the alleged
: crime of releasing strong cryptography to the world.
: : As a result of Philip Zimmermann's contribution, you can use the widely
: available freeware program PGP to send electronic-mail messages to
: anyone in the world, in complete privacy! In addition you can send
: authentication with your messages so that the recipient can verify that
: the message really came from you. You can encrypt sensitive files on
: your computer so that the files remain private even if your computer and
: disks are stolen.
: : In this free workshop, our presenter Paul Elliott will show you how you
: can use PGP effectively, easily, and intelligently. PGP is available for
: most popular computers and Operating Systems, including MSDOS, UNIX, MAC
: and OS/2 among many others.
: : The Workshop will take place at on January 14, at 3:00 PM at the
: offices of South Coast Computing located at 1811 Bering, Suite 100. Park
: in the garage, and ignore the "contract only" sign.  Enter through the
: back door (adjacent to the garage) and use the house phone (dial 100) if
: the door is locked.

: : I want to propose that a change to more of a Snow Crash society

: Not necessarily to the EXTREME that Stephenson predicted, but I definitely
see alot of what he said already starting to happen.  Hell, look at the Burbclaves.  Lil' old Indiana, PA had their first drive-by shooting a
few months ago.  Some of the growing gang-warefare influence is starting to
spill over from Pittsburgh.  Once people get a little more frightened of
violence, the engineered community idea is going to explode.  Now take
that with private and corporate police forces and ... BINGO!  Snowcrash.
: Consider the possibility that the dissolution of large,

: The decentralizing effect of digital networks (or Webs a la Hakim Bey)
is pretty self evident.  One can easily extrapolate the effects of a
structure like the Internet, a structure that by nature routes around
any form of 'censorship' from above.

The U.S. attourney's office is also considering charging GM, Ford, and Chrysler for making automobiles available in such a manner that people could run someone over and leave the scene of the accident.

: : Vernon Hills, IL.
: : Vernon Hills, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, has passed legislation allowing : citizens to check out radar guns from the local police department to : catch speeders in their community. The radar guns are combined with : cameras in order to instantaneously capture the car, license number, and the : rate of speed. The citizens can check out the units for a week at a time. The : police have stated that they, at this time, will use the data to issue : warning letters to the violaters.
: Got a neighbor you don't like?  Rent one of these here radar guns and
get a set of tuning forks.  Set up the unit to catch your target, and then
just hold a tuning fork up in front of the unit (but out of range of the mounted camera).
PS -- Didn't traffic cops have one of the highest rates of testicular
cancer by occupation due to the widespread habit of resting radar guns in
their laps without switching them off?

: But how does one ensure that no logs are kept on the server, and how
does the encrypted reply block work (I can't see how this will shield
identity from both of the communicating parties)?
