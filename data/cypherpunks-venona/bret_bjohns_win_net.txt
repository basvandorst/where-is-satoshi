Can anyone tell me where a version of PGP 2.62 can be found for Linux?
I got one off of ftp.berkeley.edu (pgp262s.zip) and it (or I can not
get it) to compile on my system..

That is ok! I just called there "Sales" dept. and asked for some info.
to be sent to me on there serevers.  I got 5 copies of what is on the
WEB page. I could have done that.  I asked him for prices and told him
this was to present to a group of Marketing and Buss. type for a
community system to bring Internet access to a whole county that does
not have it now..
BTW, the system will be running on Suns and SGI's.....
Oh well..
I thought they would do better than this. So far, there no better then
sun at customer service...
