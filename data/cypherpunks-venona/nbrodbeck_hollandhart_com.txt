telephone system in the United States (and for that matter,
most of the developed world) is only capable of supporting
between 15 and 20 percent simultaneous telephone
conversations.  If the FBI wishes to set up a system that is
capable of monitoring 1% of the total number of lines, that
equates to a ability to tap 5%, not 1% of all calls in progress.

testimony of agents of the FBI, is not very widespread at all.
very truthful comment about the engineered capacity of the
telephone network in the U.S.  I made no comment
whatsoever about the current ability or desire of the FBI to
tap into individuals telephone conversations.
