This happens here in the United States.  In Campbell, California
the police have a small van which they set up on major streets.
If the radar thinks you're speeding, it photographs you and mails
you a ticket.

I hate to be the bringer of bad news, but to the best of my knowledge
Switzerland no longer allows numbered bank accounts.  Also, from
my studies of international banking, bank secrecy and tax havens,
I have never seen any reference to numbered bank accounts in any country other than Switzerland, including Liechtenstein (although
Liechtenstein does have better secrecy safeguards than Switzerland.
Today, Cayman Islands has more international money in its bank than
any other country in the world due to their bank secrecy and favorable
tax status (ref: Forbes Magazine).

@_subject: Numbered Bank Accounts (Was "privacy and rights") 
"Perry Metzger" doesn't carefully read the postings which he directly
quotes before passing judgement.
I never claimed that nobody offers completely anonymous accounts.  I claimed
that, to the best of my knowledge, nobody offers the "numbered accounts" that used to be popular in Switzerland.  Austria does offer "bearer share" accounts which are completely anonymous,
but are quite different than the "numbered accounts" of old-time Switzerland.
In a "numbered account", the owner uses a hand-written rendition of the account
number as a signature.  The hand-written number is compared against bank records
to validate the authenticity of the owner.  "Bearer share" accounts, which are
available in Austria, are issued to the user with some sort of ceritificate
of ownership.  Anyone (the "bearer") who has possession of the certificate ("share") can withdraw money from the account.  No signatures or hand-writen
numbers are used to verify the owner.
If Austria does offer true numbered accounts, then I stand corrected.

@_subject: Privacy/Money Orders 
Many people use local check cashing stores to cash pay checks and
buy money orders.  Money orders are particularly useful when you
want to retain some level of privacy when purchasing things like
dirty magazines, subversive literature, etc.
There are currently two bills in the House that may force these
businesses to close.  HR 1448 and HR 3235.  I don't have the
text of these bills, but some of the check cashing stores in
my 'hood are asking customers to write their Hon. Misrepresentative
immediately and ask them to block these bills.
Does anyone have access to the text of these bills?
