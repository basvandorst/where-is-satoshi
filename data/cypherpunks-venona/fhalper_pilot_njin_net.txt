@_subject: Disinformation 
The idea of a disinformation campaign to oppose Clipper really bothers me.
Isn't the true about Clipper damning enough?  Lying about Clipper seems like
moral and ethical surrender.  I agree that lying can produce favorable results,
but I'm not willing to stoop to that level.  If the anti-Clipper people (and I
count myself one of them) can't defeat Clipper with the truth, this tells me
the world is so fucked up it deserves Clipper and Capstone in every machine on.
I feel that in the present situation with the Clipper chip, the ends justifies t
he means.  If Clipper is widely implemented it will affect the development of th
e "Information Super Highway" for years to come.  What Jim Miller sayts about ly
ing about Clipper is true.  But, what if that is the only way to open peoples eyes?  Any means neccesary is the ONLY way to a victory in this case.  you can't truly believe that the government is inly going to implement Clipper on a "voluntary" basis?

The Net is growing rapidly.  As it grows it will become more signifigant in our
world(transaction of digital cash, etc.)  Security will become more of a neccesi
ty(lets face it MOST people don't need encryption)  If Clipper is widely impleme
(be it voluntary or forced) people will be looking over their shoulders and righ
tfully so.  Also, i feel that the structure of the Internet is likely to change(
It's present structure is not a good base to build on) when the cahnge occurs do
n't you think
Clipper is going to become the "standard."

I don't know if this is correct, but from what I have read it seems that the Net needs and will be restructured somtime in the future.  I think our biggest concern when it happens will be that Clipper like encryption and monitoring will be implmented as a
standard.  Who knows maybe the net will be run by the government.

This message is in response to the person who implied that the "Super Bills" were created by the US government as a device to get Clipper implemented.  I just thought I should put things in perspective.  I refuse to beleive the US
government would do such a thing for several reasons. 1) I still have some faith in the governments intentions.
2) Do you really think Clipper is that important?  I mean I don't exactly think
Clipper is the governments top priority.  We are trillions of dollars in debt,
our economy sucks, health care is being reformed.  Be realistic.
3) With our economy showing signs of growth(little growth but its there) why would we commit economic suicide making the dollar fall more?
Anyway that is my $.03

Depends on your definition of secure.  Since it is run on Julf's
personal computer, I'd say the hardware is secure from tampering.  But,
given that it does not support PGP, and has the potential to reveal
anonymous IDs when cross-posting, and has had problems with spoofed mail
etc, I would say it's not very sercure.

NATIONAL CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY
The National Research Council is conducting a comprehensive study of
national cryptography policy, including such topics as: the availability of
cryptography technology to foreign and domestic parties; the
competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers and users of such technology; U.S.
national security and law enforcement interests; relative merits of various
cryptographic technologies; demand for information systems security based
on cryptography; the impact of foreign restrictions; the extent to which
current  policy is adequate for protecting U.S. interests; relative merits
of current key escrow implementation schemes; feasible policy options; and
recommendations for the process through which all interests are balanced in
the formulation of national cryptography policy. Send comments and other

But what happens if, say, a minor is solicited for sex when they are
pretending to be older than they are ? Or if the solicitation comes via a
remailer ?  Or a minor with a grudge fakes email to show that someone
attempted to get them to agree to sex/picture-taking or whatever ?
Once you pass laws making some forms of communication illegal, you're
immediately getting into dodgy territory requiring is-a-person
credentials and so on. That isn't neccesarily a problem if it's voluntary
(e.g. your kids accounts might be set up to only accept mail from people
who're certified to be under 18 or whatever), but governments are
unlikely to do things that way.
Any person no matter their age should be wary if someone solicits them for sex.
I'm 16 years old and have been on the Internet for a little more than a year and
I haven't nor have I met anyone who has been approached by a pedophile.  The examples used are isolated incidents, which could have likely been prevented had
they discussed it with their parents or tried to obtain more info about the person they were going to meet.
