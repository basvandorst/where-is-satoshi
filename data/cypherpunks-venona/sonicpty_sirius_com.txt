CD-ROM--good. CD-Audio--weeeelll...could be trouble. Keep in mind Red
Book audio does not require 100% error correction, so it would be pretty
likely the keys would not match given the tiniest data hiccup. A data mode
should work (i'd think).
Then you can send up to 600M of totally secure data before you
   3-4 sec. on High; no more, no less. Remove the oven bulb beforehand for
best viewing:)
over 1192 CD players served, but who's counting?
