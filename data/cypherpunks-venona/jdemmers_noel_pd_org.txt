^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Nothing, absolutely nothing (IMVHO) is inherently wicked.  This is a virtual forum, and as such, it is not (nor should it be) subject to the
same laws that bound similar dialogues in actuality.  The cyberspacial medium begs the development of new and unique forms of interaction - and broadening one's means of expression through the use of multiple identities
is perfectly valid in my book.
As for conspiracies-to-mislead, I must have seen at least 20 or 30 last night while I was watching the World Series.  I don't know how many others
'buy' (pun intended) into the crap that passes between their ears during the course of any given day, but I consider myself intelligent enough to weed through the chaff unassisted.  Peer pressure has always been a powerful coercive - so what?  It's not my job to calibrate the 'moral compass' of others...I leave it to them as an exercise (to be turned in at check out time).
Give me a break!  A little structure goes a long way but these rules call to mind elementary school experiences that I thought I'd left behind.   I can see it now:         The Cypherpunks List
                   (schizophrenics need not apply)
Let's move on...

@_subject: farewell cypherwonks... 
I picked up the following tidbit off of the Computists' Communique:
    The Cypherwonks list for electronic democracy, cryptography,
digital cash, etc., "has essentially died at the hand of one of
its founders and his numerous detractors."  Other members are
seeking a moderated forum.  [Sam Sternberg (samsam
