@_subject: Re: Digicash on Scientific American 
I was impressed with the slant of this essay.  I remember another article
on different forms of digital cash in Popular Science where the author mentions
ecash and the only thing said about it was that it could aid drug-traffickers.
I was glad to see the article in Scientific American that gives the positive
side of ecash.  It did seem from some of the responces to the Popular Science
article that most people disagreed with the author's point of view on anonymous digital cash. `finger -l markm for public key and Geek Code

I have heard a lot about the Elementrix POTP encryption algorithm.  I remain
skeptical of this algorithm until the source code is released.
I don't believe this is an error caused by the author's ignorance of encryption.  I remember hearing the same exact thing about POTP "not using an
encryption algorithm" from one of the Elementrix spokespeople.
I downloaded the secure email client for windoze and it seemed to make sense.
I might have misunderstood the documentation but it says that it has to
establish a "secure channel" with the other person by reciprocating emails with
what I would guess to be key synchronization data.  FYI, this client is  available from the Elementrix FTP site at ftp.elementrix.com.

@_subject: Re: using pgp to make an otp 
There is a way to make a file with random contents using PGP.  Just type
pgp +makerandom=xxx file.ext where xxx is the size of the file you want to
create.  I would not advise using this or other methods using a pseudo-
random number generator.
The random output of PGP is pretty random but when the output is used to
generate very large OTP's, patterns will no doubt exist.  Hardware RNG's
are still the best. `finger -l markm for public key and Geek Code

@_subject: Re: Who needs time vaults anyway? 
The main problem I would see with this scheme is that it uses Moore's law.
I do not think that Moore's law will hold true forever.  Microchips are
becoming so small that they will eventually reach a point where they will
not be able to be any smaller without facing quantum uncertainty.  At
this point, either the increase in computer speed will stop or something
like parallel processing or quantum computers will become feasible and the
amount of compute time will be very little.  Using this type of scheme
might be usefull now, but most likely, a new law about increasing computer
power will have to be developed in the next twenty years.

@_subject: Re: IDEA encryption 
IDEA uses 128-bit keys.  The program must do some XORing with the user key
to expand it to 16 bytes.  Therefore, I would guess that it would be more
secure to use a longer key.
It probably isn't going to help with security at all if you plan to use a
hexadecimal representation of the hash as is the common output of hashing
programs.  The best key would be one that uses random letters, numbers, and
Not very secure.  I have heard that there is a Linux undelete and there might
be a similar program for other Unices.  If the hard drive is examined using
special hardware, data will be recoverable.  The data should be overwritten
at least five times, maybe more depending on the level of security you want,
before being deleted.

@_subject: Re: Attacking Clipper with timing info? 
The Clipper chip itself does not use digital signatures and public key
encryption.  It only implements an block cypher.  You were probably talking
about Capstone which does use PK crytpo and digital signatures.  Capstone
uses DSS as the digital signature which is explicitly pointed out in the
summary of the timing attack.  I don't think what algorithm it uses for
key exchange has been releases yet, but it probably is vulnerable.  So
Capstone is indeed vulnerable to timing attacks.

This is exactly how the clipper works.  The unit key is XORed with 160
random bits, the result is given to one government agency, and the random
bits are given to another agency.
The largest concern I have about wiretapping is not so much that some corrupt
law enforcement agents will wiretap me out of malice, but that if I communicate
with someone who is being wiretapped, my end of the conversation will be heard
as well.  I might be giving out sensitive information to some government
agent without ever violating any laws and without any reason for the government
to believe that I was a criminal.  For this reason, I believe that cryptography
should not be regulated.  I would never trust the government with any of my
decryption keys.
