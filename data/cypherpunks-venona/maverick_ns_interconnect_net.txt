Hallam-Baker Wrote -- There's four major problems with this.  First off, a large number of guns used in homicides are revolvers or derringers (anyone got the numbers?).  These guns don't spit out the shells.  So, it would be utterly useless to do so.  The second problem is the number of shells expelled in the US every day.  I doubt there's enough room on the butt end of a shell to print that number (it couldn't be printed on the sides, as this would screw up the fit of the shell, and possibly weaken it).  And, it'd be almost impossible getting gun manufacturers to
pay for the equiptment that it would take to emprint serial numbers.  The third number is that cartridges are recycled.  Aside from reloading your own, there's a large number of people that sweep up brass from gun ranges to reload themselves.  The idea that someone swept up the brass could get almost anyone off. The final problem is the paperwork.  Cops today can barly keep up with the paperwork involved with the Brady Bill.  Could you imagine if they had to keep track of AMMO purchases?
The provision to give people the means to commit treason against the government are in the Constitution.  That's why the second amendment is there -- to empower the people to protect themselves against the government.  Then there's the first amendment, which is there partially so that the people can keep the government in check with speech and the press.
The NRA, I'm sorry to say, has screwed up royally.  It's about time that they regroup, or else they fall.
