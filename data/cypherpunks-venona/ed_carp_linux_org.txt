You have to excuse Perry.  You see, in Perry's eyes, anyone who doesn't agree with him, and has the intestinal fortitude to say so, is called names and told they are "insulting" him.  As Tom Clancy says in "Debt of Honor", "It was a source of constant surprise to Ryan that important grown-ups so often acted like five-year-olds."

That the mailing list material was funneled through khijol to asar in an
obvious attempt to hide the poster's true identity doesn't bother me a bit.
What *does* bother me is taht Bill Wells tries to blame it on *me*, stating
that *I* was the one who posted the material.  Not that it's really relevent
*who* posted it, it just annoys me that the guy is so damned paranoid.  I
wonder why?  What's he afraid of?
Gee, sounds a little like LD...

I think that most people forget that as soon as that sort of money enters the
banking system, it can be tracked.  "Wire $20K to XXX" presumes that that
$20K came from somewhere, and unless you're careful about where it came
from and where it's going, you could be buying yourself a whole lot of
unwanted attention, even if it's a prefectly legitimate transaction.  Coming
in with a suitcase full of money is bound to get you talked about, and writing
a check... well...
It's getting rather difficult to move large sums of money around nowadays if
it either enters or leaves the US banking system, and if it's a friendly
nation (which Canada is), if the Feds have a reason to look at you, an
international border isn't going to prove much of a drawback.

Also add that many people seem to tend to swirl the mouse in fast circles,
where there isn't *any* latency between mouse movements, and you get even
less entropy.  I suspect that Colin Plumb's code, while a nice try, would
be a bit less useful that might have been otherwise suspected.

@_subject: Re: Netscape for Linux? 
Does this mean that a Linux version of Netscape will no longer be available, or that it *will* be available but unsupported?
That all depends on what you mean by "support".  If you mean "we will no longer make Netscape available for the Linux platform", that's not support.  If you mean "we will no longer respond to bug reports for Netscape on this platform" then that's discontinuing support.
Please be more specific in your postings?
As a project manager and developer, I have constructed many a business case for the development and/or support for products - such a case could easily be made for Linux support for Netscape, irrespective of what you mean by "support".

No, they'll just flood it with RF and force your diode to act as a detector - then they can feed you anything they like ;)
I learned the hard way - keep the transmitters away from a reverse-biased doide acting as a noise generator.  Only until I examined the output did I realize it wasn't random.  I fixed it, though, by looking at the output
and testing its randomness.

Colin Powell will be in Dallas at the Taylor's Bookstore out on Belt Line Rd. and Prestonwood (right next to Prestonwood Mall).  October 3 at 6 PM.  I plan to be there - anyone else from the DFW area going?  Anyone have any questions they want asked (other than the usual "where do you stand on the administration's position regarding the use and exportation of so-called 'strong crypto' and the Clipper/Capstone fiasco"?

I don't see any reason why crypto routines written in C can't be converted to .DLL files - then you can call them from VB or whatever.  No need to convert them to VB.
