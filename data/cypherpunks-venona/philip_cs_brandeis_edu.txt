I am looking to put together an MD5 message digest program and have
extracted the MD5.c and MD5.h files from PGP(excerpt of the MD5.h file
below) but I'm not sure how it all works. Can someone who is familiar with
the functions and the data structure please e-mail me with a bit of
guidance as to what each one does and how to implement it. If anyone can
lead me to a good description of the processes involved I would appreciate
that too. Thanks.
struct MD5Context {
        uint32 buf[4];
        uint32 bits[2];
        unsigned char in[64];
void MD5Init(struct MD5Context *context);
void MD5Update(struct MD5Context *context, unsigned char const *buf,
unsigned len);
void MD5Final(unsigned char digest[16], struct MD5Context *context);
void MD5Transform(uint32 buf[4], uint32 const in[16]);

I need a version that will run on a Mac also which is the version I am
putting together now. I know there are versions for DOS and other platforms
but I specifically need to be able to run it on a Mac since the server I am
producing is Mac-based.

What is the best free/shareware program for protecting(and I mean
government-strength encryption) a Mac folder or creating a protected Mac
Additionally, are any of the commercial products available safer than these
free/shareware ones?
