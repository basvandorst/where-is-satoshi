Silly things happen when one responds literally to an obvious metaphor.  (see, "analogy.")
Nonsense.  Richard may have read my response on the Unedited list
and Paul post on the Moderated list, but I sent my response to
each list in the appropriate order, Paul's post, followed by my response.  In any event, how would intentionally reversing the order have benefited me?  This specious argument makes no sense.  Nope, wrong again.  I referenced sophistry and hypocracy.  I leave the significance of the difference as an exercise to the
student.  (Hint: one is an argument to the man, the other isn't.)
And wrong yet again.  Not a personal attack but commentary on wooly thinking.
One might read my posts on this point and pay attention.

You have probably just read John's post.  I truly hope YOU (each
and every one of you) can rise to his challenge.  If you have offered nothing in the past but criticism, it's now time to get a
bit more real.  What will it be, your money, time, equipment?
I would hope that the loudest advocates of "free speech" turn out
to be the most generous, but I'm not holding my breath.  Maybe the solution(s) will come from you lurkers.  I hope you can put
down your beer long enough to get involved.
Finally, if anyone wants to discuss why the Cypherpunk list has
come to this, or what I did right or wrong as a moderator, let's
talk about--on the new list(s) YOU create.  For now, though, it's
off-topic.  We have work to do.
