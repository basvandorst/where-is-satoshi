@_subject: PGP on local machine (was Re: MacPGP) 
The following would require customization on both ends, but seems doable:
You compose the message, using emacs or some other Turing-complete editor.
You hit the "PGPify" key [sequence].
emacs echoes a special START string
The local comm program recognizes it and goes into "capture" mode.
emacs blats the plaintext to stdout, where it is captured.
emacs echoes a STOP string.
The comm program sees this, stops capturing, shells to DOS, and runs PGP.
emacs kills the original text block.
(emacs command ends)
The comm program shoves the cyphertext into the upload stream.
(comm macro reverts to lurk mode)
You send the message.
All of this, I think, could be implemented with available programs.
Kermit won't hack it on the local end, so maybe I'll switch to
Telemate.  This protocol would require a clean line or EC modem; is
this a problem?
It might be a better move to write a [shell, Perl] script that's a
drop-in replacement for Unix pgp: it goes through the whole protocol
above, and looks to the outside world as if it had done the work
itself.  People have written emacs macros (I think) to make this
work with mail; it could also be used as a unix-pgp replacement in
other places.
It might be nice if the plaintext were not echoed to the screen while
being transferred, too.

True.  Perhaps we should look at the problems of universal anonymity
in contexts where they can already be observed -- like cellulose
mail.  It would be possible to implement a "postage" analog without a backed
crypto currency.  Each remailer could issue usage tickets, good for
a certain flow per month.  Issue them to individuals, and let them
circulate.  There are obvious problems; for one, transactions would
be on a good-will basis, except in the case of trades to consolidate
a block with a single remailer.  This would produce allocation
problems.  In this mileau, a net.loser might be able to panhandle a
truckload of tickets.  On the up side, it's a good cover for getting
currency up and running.
With real postage, I think the problem would be negligible.  I can
imagine a custom developing that mail from nyms not on the "pass"
list would have to include a certain fee just to make into the

What you'd want to do is uncompress the byte stream, twiddle the low

that GIFs are colormapped, and the map need have no coherence
between entries 8 and 9.  Even optimally arranged (a non-trivial
task; looks like the salesman travels colorspace...), that low bit
is probably going to be significant enough to munge things visibly.
What you'd have to do is remap the file to 128 colors, duplicate
them in the colormap, and encode your message in the choice of
identical entries.  Unfortunately, most images look bad enough
mapped to 256 colors, and will degrade further in 128.  Though I
suppose nobody really wants to look at the image anyway...
Your compression is also going to die.  This may provide a quick way
to scan for this technique, and finding a redundant colormap is a
dead giveaway of either secrecy or stupidity.  You could fix that by
tweaking twin colors slightly, adding a bit of visible noise.

I think it's even worse... with unlossy compression, you can frob
the uncompressed bits and just lose compression.  With lossy, you
can't do that, because your message will be smeared away.  And
frobbing the compressed stream will produce ghastly artifacts.
But not all images will be lossily compressed.  I find that JPEG,
for example, usually introduces too much gunk to be useful.
Certainly, sending an LZW TIFF should be above suspicion for quite
some time.
Yeah, this is just a cheesy OTP.  Not much point, really.
I've been thinking about the GIF case; the "optimize for colormap
cyclic continuity" technique looks like it will produce better
images than the "crunch to 128 colors".  Since I have to write some
annealing code for a neural-net trainer, maybe I'll repackage it for
colormap optimization and see what the results look like.  If you
wanted minimum visible crud, you could start with a true-color pic,
find the colormap, order it, and dither down -- rather than adding
white noise to pre-existing dithering.
You know, I think I've been taking the graphics-weenie approach to
this.  Who cares how the image looks?  Who cares if it's even an

resulting image showed little degradation, and was smaller than the
original -- the information thrown out when mapping down to 128 was
not fully replaced, as the "hidden" file did not fill the GIF.
Rather than screw with GIF and Heckbert code for this throwaway, I
did the {en,de}giffing and palette manipulation by hand with the PC
program PICLAB.  It supports scripts, which would automate the
process, except for the palette duplication, which a sed script
could do.  The bit bashing code is appended, though it's pretty

cryptography in this country and in the world.  Perhaps if
encryption algorithms were not encumbered, they would already be in
common use, rendering Clipper untenable.  If RSA Inc. wishes to sell
me a license I shouldn't have to buy, that would be nice.  If they
wish to show their change of heart in some other way, that would be
nice too, as long as it doesn't come with a licensing agreement like
RSAREF's.  But if they're going to continue to sit on their patents,
I'll do without their blessing.
Incidentally, I don't think the issue of algorithm patents is as
minor as some have portrayed it.  It has blocked the use of RSA,
after all, giving Clipper a window.  Furthermore, there are patents
on approximately every other cryptographic technique: PK in general,
exponential key exchange, LUC, IDEA, DigiCash, ....  Patents may gut
cryptology the way they have data compression, to pick one example.
This would be a shame.

I don't see that X-TTL is very useful as currently proposed.  As I see
it, I would have to create something like this:
X-TTL: 5
Request-Remailing-To: remailer1
Request-Remailing-To: remailer2
Request-Remailing-To: remailer3
Request-Remailing-To: remailer4
Request-Remailing-To: remailer5
Dummy message to be sent.
(Or an equivalent structure could be set up with nested PGP encryptions.)
This would go through remailers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, decrementing the
X-TTL field each time, and after the last one when it was 0 the message
would be deleted.  The X-TTL is not very convenient in this case since
you still have to come up with a path for sending your message which is
at least as long as the X-TTL value.
It seems to me that the X-Discard idea is simpler; you can just put the
X-Discard in the command block for the last remailer, and you don't have
to count them.
What is needed to make X-TTL useful is for the remailer to choose another
remailer as its destination, and ideally to encrypt the message before
sending it.  This way X-TTL can be used to insert a random remailer path of
n hops in the middle of a sender-constructed remailing path.  This leads to
a system where the remailer decrypts an incoming message, reads the X-TTL
value, decrements it, re-encrypts the message for the next remailer in the
chain, and sends it.  The X-TTL value is never exposed to outsiders.
At one point I wrote a modification to my remailer to cause it to
encrypt any message which it sent to another remailer which supported
PGP.  But I decided that this didn't really help security enough to
be worthwhile.  It would be much better to encourage users to encrypt
their messages themselves in a nested fashion so that no remailer sees
any more information than the bare minimum necessary.

Heh.  Lack of sufficient bits for digital sound results in a floor of
uniformly-distributed white noise for complex signals such as music.
If audiophiles really hear "tinny" or "metallic" sound in double-blind
tests, it would more likely be due to the sampling rate.  The 44kHz
rate means that skimping on the lowpass filter will push the cutoff
into the audible range, which means you lose some upper harmonics and
get to hear any phase nonlinearity in the filter.
Round to 16 bits.  The higher-precision recording format is good
because it lets noise (e.g. from mixing up a quiet signal) chew off
four bits before it gets on the CD.  You can do a little better than
rounding, but not much.
It may well not be, particularly if you do it without regard to the
piece's amplitude.  That 6dB of hiss may be perceptible during
A more subtle flaw is that the signal will have artificial statistical
characteristics.  Natural noise in recordings is typically Gaussian,
not uniform noise covering exactly one bit.  What this means is that
if the LSB is total uncorrelated hash, the bit above will have some
noise.  Look at a quiet passage.  If the LSB is noise city and the
14th is uniformly zero, somebody twiddled with the digital data.  This
is a more reasonable way of screening for this sort of steganography
than hiring a bunch of audiophiles.  One fix is to cover your nefarious LSB activities by first adding
sufficient Gaussian noise.  My intuition, however, is that any amount
short of microwaving the CD will leave a little bit of correlation
between the original and the noised lower bits.  With sufficient data,
I think you can burn through the Gaussian noise and get enough
information to make a call on whether the LSB has been twiddled.  And
a CD is a lot of data.

The pseudo-random number generator:

is easy to break.  One could guess the pattern from only a few numbers
of the series.  My point is that that series can be used as a basis for
better PRNGs.  I suggested using something like:
     if a_n-2 < 195  then  a_n = a_n-4 + a_n-3   mod 256
     if a_n-2 > 194  then  a_n = a_n-4 + a_n-3 + a_n-1   mod 256
This is considerably less easy to break.  Even if one could surmise that
the (n-1) term was being added in sometimes and not others, you'd still
have to examine a large section of the series to figure out exactly what
method was being used to determine when the extra term was being
inserted (you'd have to see an example where a_n-2=194 and note that the
term was not included, and you'd have to see the situation a_n-2=195 and
note that it was included.  Plus, double-encryption could be used to
increase the security.

@_subject: Re: really hiding encrypted data 
I wrote something about this just a mont or two ago.  Rather than
going through it all again, let me summarize and go off in a
different direction.  Yes, simple-minded LSB steganography should be
detectible.  Its statistical effect is to stomp hard on the lowest
bit with white noise, while doing nothing to higher bits.  This
isn't a very plausible noise source.  I've been hoping to find some
time over winter break to brush up on my statistics and put together
a steganography detector.  This sort of analysis might not hold up
in court, as it's always possible that somebody has a bogus ADC or
something, but it's fine for traffic analysis.  I think the trick
will be avoiding false positives on images that have been dithered
at some point during their life...
You could hit only scattered bits, but this sort of noise isn't
realistic either.  What you want is to end up with plausible
statistics.  One possibility is to construct a model for the
less-significant planes of the types of images (or other data) which
you intend to use.  If you leave a parameter or two free, or
partially free, you should be able to fit some data in without being
blatant about it.  Low data rate, though.  Constructing a decent
data model for this purpose is beyond me.
A simple approach: add plenty of Gaussian noise, and maybe introduce
some moire crud to make it look lousy.  Then replace every n'th LSB
with a bit of your choice.  This should be plausible enough to past
most auto-scanners, who probably can't afford to get too many false

Perhaps the context is relevant.  Chaitin's `omega', for example, is
Kolmogorov random (too bad!).  (Omega is the sum over all x of m(x),
where m(x) is the Solomonoff-Levin distribution.)
This is an informal argument, using an informal definition of
randomness.  Presumably in this discussion we could standardize
on Kolmogorov randomness, to which definition Berry's paradox

It would be easy enough to split the message by XOR into as many
pieces as you wish.  This would be much more secure than an
every-nth-byte division, though it would increase total traffic
correspondingly.  Taking into account the non-ideality of the
remailer net, using m-of-n secret sharing would be more reliable.
It's not clear to me that this buys you much, though.  Encrypting
the message end-to-end will suffice to keep it private.  What
remailers do for you is impede traffic analysis.  Sending your
message in n pieces gives a traffic watcher n chances.

This is hardly cut-and-dried.  Try the defense lawyer's
interpretation: recipients of the CD-ROM are leaf nodes; the CD-ROM
is a convenient transport medium.  Usenet has been propagated over
magtape, after all.  CD-ROM is the modern equivalent, cheaper to cut
than a tape.
You seem to be concerned that your words might be stored on a
`permanent' medium.  You should be.  Anything you post is propagated
to a vast and unknown number of systems worldwide.  *Somebody* is
going to archive it, maybe back it up to WORM.  You know this
already, so what's the big deal about a CD-ROM?
I agree with your basic contention that authors of Usenet postings
retain copyright minus some concession to the nature of the medium.
But your concessions are unrealistically limited.  In the real world,
you can't count on the destruction of every copy of your `ephemeral'
article.  You can't know or control the media of propagation.  You
can't expect the RFCs to be followed to the letter -- the bulk of
news systems these days are probably neighborhood BBSes who run their
gateway software out of the box.  This is Usenet; post if you can

VERY feasible.  The US government has had this technology for several

military launched a satellite to spy on the Russians.  The satellite was
programmed to scan radio transmissions - especially cellular phones -
searching for key words which might be related to military or government
activities.  It seems a few communist party members got a little too
confortable with their cellular phones in their limosuines, and spoke
very loosely about some secret government projects...

The low bits would probably be destroyed just by transmission over
your average voice line.  Worse, Clipperfones will compress the
input speech before encryption.  The only respectable audio
compression algorithms are lossy, and they will assuredly stomp on
your low bits.  Nor can you expect other modulations to survive
(e.g. the "data --> 212A --> Clipper --> 212A --> data" approach).
Given knowledge of the audio model used, you could take your data
stream and put it through the decompressor end.  The resultant
audio would be invariant under the lossy compression/decompression.
