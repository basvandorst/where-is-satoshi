For my cable company I asked why they wanted it.  For a security check when
you call in was the response.  Does it need to be an actuall social
security number?  No, just something you can remember when you call up.
012-01-0123 I replied.  They were quite happy to use that as my "Social
Security Number" in their database.    As far as cable goes they don't want
your social security number.  I wonder how many others would be happy to
substitute something.

Pig Latin or even the old 10 codes as in 10-4 are against the amateur
rules.  The only allowed code scheme is morse code and Q codes.  Both are
clasified as a well defined language.  Using english and having a
conversation that means something other than the standard usage is also
prohibited.  If you don't like it then stick to CB-Radio.  At least that is
the FCC's position.

The congress doesn't pass laws regarding marriages.  That is all up to
individual states.

And just to clear up some silly misconception people have.  SSN numbers are not indicative of where someone was born.  Only where they applied for a SSN number.

I think it is appropriate.  Take "Believer" to court and hope I don't happen to be sitting on the jury.
