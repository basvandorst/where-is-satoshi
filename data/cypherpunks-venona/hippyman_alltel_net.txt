Why don't you contact the owner and ask him how it works?  Posting to
cypherpunks and asking questions about it seems a bit unusual.  Smells like
a spam.  You're name wouldn't be Spyking, would it? hippyman ICQ: 11517383

My wrong, then. I enjoy your list and didn't really think you spam another mailing list in
such a fashion as I was interpreting, but I thought I'd sniff it out anyway.
My apologies for the accusation. hippyman ICQ: 11517383

Nope, it's usually pretty boring.
Been there many times when I'm on irc, nothing happening.
BUT, if you show up - I can make it interesting!!
Logins and passes to play with!
Catch me in there.
