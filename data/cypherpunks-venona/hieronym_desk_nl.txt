Information Warfare represents a global challenge that
faces all late-industrial and information age nation states.
It also represents the easiest and cheapest way for less
developed nation-states and religious or political
movements to anonymously and grievously attack major
nations and international corporations. Not only are the
definitions of InfoWar unclear, but they span many areas
and disciplines. This conference will examine the
European perspectives on all three classes of Information
Warfare while contributing some American lessons
learned, mistakes made and successes enjoyed. The
conference will look at these three areas of interest: Class
I: Personal Privacy Class II: Industrial and Economic
Spying and Warfare Class III: Global Conflict, Terrorism

- Devices now in field testing with the U.S. Marines,
according to  Ellison C. Urban, Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA) in his paper "The Information
are described as follows:
The Tamer: The Tamer system consists of a global
positioning system (GPS) receiver, a liquid-crystal display
(LCD), thumb-input      devices, data ports, and software
for intelligence reports -- all in a single module integrated
with a standard-issue Melios laser rangefinder. In a future
version the LCD will be eliminated and a video capability
added; an intelligence report form filled out by the soldier
and automatically transmitted by a geopositioning satellite
will be superimposed on the scene through the viewfinder.
VoiceMap: Via the VoiceMap (or a similar system,
Pathfinder, shown on the Web site), the user's location is
fixed by a GPS receiver and then displayed on an
electronic map, where it is compared with the user's
itinerary. Maps can be scrolled or scaled with voice
commands, as well as updated with tactical data sent from
other units by radio link. In future, the attached computer
will have an artificial intelligence capability, permitting it to
respond to complex queries, such as "What is the best
route to way station Delta?"
VuMan: The VuMan is a body-hugging computer with an
easily manipulated circular dial that displays animations of
repair      procedures, replacing thousands of pages of
maintenance manuals. Soldiers simultaneously see both
their equipment and the computer information through a
head-up display.
MARSS: The  Maintenance and Repair Support System
(MARSS) is the first application planned for an electronic
vest called the bodyLAN, which provides a wireless local-
area network that interconnects with personnel and their
systems. A MARSS-equipped soldier wearing the vest can
walk up to a piece of equipment in need of repair -- a tank,
say -- and have it disgorge its self-diagnostics by radio to
the soldier's on-board computer. That computer, linked to
other devices, sorts the information and links up to
logistics stations in the rear or around the world. The
bodyLAN vest presents both potential benefits and
potential problems.).
The MARSS project is the first application of a central
element planned for all TIAs: a wireless local-area network

Victor Navasky, how head ed of _The Nation_. Any credulous right-wing kooks
looking for a "deeper understanding" of the _Iron Mountain Report_ might
want to check out a session on it being held by the Learning Alliance:
Lewin, Navasky, and a couple of others'll be yakking about it (in New York,
I assume).

very fluidly incorporated into patronage networks, for example, or that
their incorporation would affect network dynamics in any notable way. One
doesn't need to understand political theory or economy in any analytical
sense to become part of a patronage network, and one doesn't need to
understand cryptography to know  what a key is vaguely enough to be swayed
by someone waving a "well-signed" key around--in fact, _not_ understanding
cryptography will lead people to be wowed by such keys. Most people don't
understand cryptography, and most will continue not to understand it. So in
the pristine realm of mathematics, the Ethics Committee may be wrong, but
in the real world of sloppy thinking they're basically right. Basically.
companies, a few dozen heads of state,  bigwig spooks from around the
world, the pope and a dozen cardinals, it's not too hard to imagine how I
could open a few doors with that key--and make a buck or two in the process.

stretching it that most others would think so as well... My point wasn't
that the committee was "right" in any elegant sense but, rather, that their
misperceptions are almost certainly indicative of the kinds of
misperceptions that will propagate far and wide--and be effective--as
public-key encryption becomes more common. Humanity managed to get by for
centuries laboring under the delusion that cheese produces worms: the fact
that they were wrong doesn't make those centuries of fact go away.
