The ECPA (Electronic Communications Privacy Act) banned cell phone
scanning, as of 1994 I believe. When Newt was monitored, that was
nothing really new.
Ch 83, (890-986?) is cell, however Federal law (Title 18, Chapter 119)
makes cell monitoring illegal only if it INTENTIONAL. And owning and
buying cell-phone capable devices is LEGAL. The only catch is who is
selling it, it is my understanding you can sell a cell scanner used
without a prob. I currently own a cell-capable scanner. A great man named Ben Tersian once said
"Avoid the cliche 'Information must be free'"
"Find it learn it embrace it and set it free."

@_subject: WinNT C2? 
Windows NT4.0 has been tested under the red book spec published by the
NCSC. That means in effect, NT is C2 compliant in a stand alone
environment. Howver, NT does NOT comply with the orange book spec which
defines additional requirements when the machine is used in a networked
environment. It *IS* possible for an operating system that is on a
networked machine to be C2(Orange Book) compliant. Microsoft has never
stated that it is C2 compliant on a network, however their page about C2
and NT is poorly worded, and effectively discounts the importance of the
Orange Book spec.
It would be fun to get ahold of the specs from the NCSC.

In addition to the converstaion, MS says:
Microsoft has opted not to include certain components of Windows NT in the
evaluation process, not because they would not pass the evaluation, but to
save time by reducing the load on the NSA. Additionally, the
MS-DOS/Windows on Windows (WOW) system may be treated as a Win32
application and would therefore not need to be evaluated as part of the
Trusted Computer Base (TCB). Networking on NT may not have to go
through the "Red Book," or "Trusted Network Interpretation." It may be
enough to consider networking to be another subsystem, and therefore only
the Orange Book would apply. New or modified components and other hardware
platforms can go through a "RAMP" process to be included in the evaluation
at a later time. [Isn't it great, you have to register for FREE support?]

@_subject: Re: WinNT C2? - How about WinNT and some C-4? 
Surprisingly enough NT4.0 has not received the C2 rating, although I could
have sworn I have seen remarks about Nt4.0 and C2 certification on a
Microsoft page. According to WIRED, NT 4.0 is undergoing testing, and will
supposedly be certified in Oct.
Apparently the gov't isn't too happy with the way MS is bluring the edges
of C2 certification of their products [Which they are buying].
