Most humble apologies from a lurker for posting this question to the whole
list.  I couldn't
find the reference in the archives...
About a month or two ago, someone posted some information on that little
piece of code
attached to MS Mail messages alongside the file attachment.  I need to find
out the
vulnerabilities of that code, such as susceptibility to virus, spoof,
attack, etc.
Not crypto related, but important to me nonetheless.
Please send responses to me via e-mail.  Thanks in advance.
