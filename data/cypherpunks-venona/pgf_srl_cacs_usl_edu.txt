Uh, Gary, the reason noone's started more research into getting
oil from coal is that it's cheaper to get oil from oil. While we
are too dependent on foreign sources right now, the price of oil
has never been cheaper than now and could go up probably a lot and
not raise the price of gas much compared to how much taxes and
inflation have raised it since 1972.

extropians list at present, but come to think of it, these people
(and there are, as far as I can tell, more than just two or three)
probably have between them the time or means to set up their own
"extropians list for people tired of ExI's list" mailing list and
this might be an appropriate means for getting off-topic discussions
off of cypherpunks.

Another question entirely:
Might it be better just to use some sort of stream cypher that

the used parts are deleted as it goes along? I'm thinking currently
of telnet-level applications or larger-level ones based on telnet
like HTTP (I know, technically there are better descriptions of HTTP
and the like).
It would be easy to pre-distribute the one-time pads via PGP or
RSA. This has the advantage of not locking the whole infrastructure
into a single public key system.

(End of current message from Tim. I hope to do several in one message). Okay, I pretty much agree with what you wrote about GNU Smalltalk.
I don't know it, I've only read (most of the) standard Smalltalk book,
and by comparison to the original from PARC GNU Smalltalk is missing
crucial bits.
My point is not that GNU Smalltalk is good compared to uncrippled
Smalltalk, but that it may be better than Perl/TCL/whatever else
is being proposed.
One of the main merits of Perl seems to be that it's a free scripting
language that isn't dependent on what shell (bash, ksh, whatever) you
are using and is apparently highly environmentally independent.
Oh, I give up. What I'm trying to say is that it's a Schelling point.
(You'll have to look up what that is if you don't understand. I'm
sorry, but it's the best way for me to describe what I mean).
It gains a "developer," programmer, and user base because it is a
Schelling point, not because of any actual merits as a programming
language itself.  Please note that I am not saying that it does not
have these merits.
This is according to some the same reason C is used in preference to
C++, C++ in preference to Objective C, and Objective C in preference
to Nicklaus Wirth's current language of the month or the Lisp or
Smalltalk-like language of your choice.
Perhaps we should simply ignore what's a Schelling Point and simply
pick a language that's going to be the best one to implement the
algorithms in, and then worry about porting the program/making it run
on other systems.
On to the next message. Here's Tim:

basic point.
I also wonder that the effort *might* have a bottleneck in the RSA
encryption algorithm itself and its patented status. You're apparently
stuck with RSA in the form RSA Corp. wants you to use it, even if they
do release it. It is their right to do so (if one believes that software
patents are valid, although off-hand I don't know anyone who does).
It's still a bottleneck.
