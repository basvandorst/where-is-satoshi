@_subject: Credit Card to eCash 
charge to a Credit Card/ATM card number and return Cash, like an ATM for
the net?
Not everyone wants to go through setting up an account at Mark Twain or
whereever, just the advantages of a more cash like system.  With a few
sites like this around, and hopefully therefore more eCash in the wallets
of the public this could help to add to a critical mass to eCash and so on.
I don't think it would create the critical mass nessary for eCash's
success, but at least another log on the fire.

Mixmaster port?  I and some other people were eyeing the idea.  If you know
who might be doing this port I would appreciate hearing from them.
