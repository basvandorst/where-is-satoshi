not near at the time of connections. This time it had to be two-way,
because he was negotiating with Moscow officials. BTW Dudajev was living in Estonia for a long time (before he started
fighting for Chechen independence), being the head of Russian air forces

Here in Estonia there was a proposal made in the parliament to remove
taxation on corporate income (right now there is a proportional corporate
income tax of 26%), which should bring more foreign investments into
Estonia and also make Estonian economy develop faster. Estonia I think is
one of few countries where there is a possibility of accepting this kind
of law. Of course European countries, USA and different international
financial organisations are very against this kind of law. This law would apply both to companies and to self-employed private persons (farmers for
Other main taxes in Estonia are 26% proportional income tax for private
persons and 18% sales tax. There is also 33% tax on salaries paid which
includes social security and medical insurance.
Of course the government taxation is not working very effectively and a
big percentage of private persons and companies pay much less than what
they are supposed to. I believe this is common to many young Eastern and
Central European countries. Off-shore companies are also popular,
including Delaware, where people as I understand just do not pay the taxes
they are supposed to. Also many people use one-time off-shore corporations
for just one bigger business deal.

This is one question why the central bank in Estonia (I am not sure about
other countries) does not allow issuing e-cash here in Estonia. While the
banks issue e-cash to people, they get some real cash from people.  This
leads to actually doubleing the money in circulation, each monetary unit,
either dollar or kroon, can at the same time be used by owner of e-cash
and at the same time by the bank. The central banks are afraid that when
the amount of e-cash in circulation gets big, this could lead to
devalvation of money, especially a small country like Estonia is afraid of
such development.
Anonymity of monetary transactions is another thing that Bank of Estonia
has declared illegal.

There is also a problem with Digicash licencing: they licence only to

also many companies that are not banks, who would also like to issue ecash
for specific purposes. Setting up an separate company issuing electronic
cash, not connected to any of the existing banks, is something that
probably will happen sooner or later. Of course there are problems of
legislation and clients trusting the company, but those are not problems
that the software manufacturer like Digicash should decide.

Some questions about writing a program that uses RSA. Let's assume we have 3 participants (Alice, Bob, Carol). The idea is for
Bob to send an encrypted and signed message to Alice. Although Bob
constructs the message, signs it and encrypts it, it is Carol who can
decide some parts of the message.
The message is small, 200-400 bytes in length. Some of the contents of the
message are always the same (field names) and the message looks much like
mail headers: Field1Name: field1contents
Field2Name: field2contents
Field3Name: field3contents
Carol can decide, what goes into the field contents. Now the easiest way would be to sign the message using Bob's private key
and encrypt is using Alice's public key. What Carol wants to do is forge
similar messages without help from Bob and send the messages to Alice.
Let's say that Bob is a bank, Alice a merchant and Carol a buyer. Usually
Bob has to take some money from Carols account and after the he signals
Alice, that she can give the goods to Carol. Now Carol wants to get the
goods without paying and give a false signal to Alice (which Alice thinks
is a signal from Bob). Both the public keys of Alice and Bob are
well-known. One of the fields will be unique for every message, so that
Carol can not use the same message to pay once and recieve the goods many
The question is easy: how should I sign and encrypt the message?
1) calculate a digest (MD5, SHA) from the message, sign the digest (or
should I sign the message contents + digest) with Bob's private key and
encrypt it with Alice's public key?
2) is there any idea to generate a DES key, encrypt the message with the
DES key, calculate a digest on (enc. message + DES key), sign the digest
and encrypt it with Alice's public key? The message is small, so the time
it takes to encrypt the message is not so important compared to higher
speed of DES.
3) may be it would be good to encrypt the message with Alice's public key,
then generate a digest, sign the digest and then once more encrypt the
whole thing with Alice's public key?
Using a DES session key helps in case someone would find out Alice's
private key she uses to decrypt the message, but actually in this case it
is not so important to hide the message contents (what is important are
message integrity and sender authentication).

crypto++, SSLeay or some other? Juri Kaljundi

The following are some news clips from Baltic News Service about a scandal
in Estonia, where some government and private databases were sold on black

own information like police and IRS databases, and is it illegal to copy
such information once it is available.

SECRET INFO IS SOLD ON BLACK MARKET, ESTONIAN POLICE SAY
   TALLINN, Nov 09, BNS - Classified information of important state
   institutions is available on the black market, according to Estonian    security police and central criminal police officials.
   A database containing information on hundreds of thousands of people,
   collected by the Tax Department, Estonian Mobile Telephone and
   Radiolinja companies, the Social Affairs Ministry and several other
   state agencies and large companies, has hit the black market, the
   Eesti Paevaleht daily reported on Saturday. Supposedly, also Customs
   Department and national car registry databases have been secretly
   copied.
   The CD-ROM with the confidential informations costs about 50,000       kroons, according to the daily.
   Security Police Director General Juri Pihl and acting deputy director
   of the central criminal police, Andres Anvelt, confirmed that numerous
   institutional databases are available on the black market.
   Anvelt said he had happened to see a pirate copy of the buildings    registry showing all transactions with buildings and their owners.
   "I've also heard that information on who owns which telephone number
   has leaked from mobile telephone companies," he added.
   Pihl said security police would investigate information leaks only
   when they concerned security police itself. Looking into database
   thefts is not directly the province of security police, he said.
   Such a secret database is a powerful weapon in the hands of organized
   crime, the daily said.
   Criminals have managed to take advantage of the insufficient
   protection of electronic databases and are sometimes better informed
   than the police, Anvelt confessed.

ESTONIAN COMMITEE CLAIMS IT HAS NO INFORMATION ON DATABASES ON BLACK
   TALLINN, Nov 11, BNS - Chairman of the Estonian parliament's security
   police committee, Vahur Glaase, said he had not enough information on
   allegedly illicit trafficking in classified databases.    "I have too little information to draw any conclusions," chairman of
   the parliamentary committee controlling the activity of the Estonian
   security police told BNS.
   The Eesti Paevaleht daily Saturday claimed that a database containing
   information of the taxation department, the Eesti Mobiiltelefon and    Radiolinja mobile telephone companies, the social affairs ministry and
   some other agencies and companies on hundreds of thousands of people
   had arrived on the Estonian black market. Presumably, the illegally    copied database also contains data of the customs department and the
   motor vehicles registration center.
   Glaase said that while a large proportion of the official information
   is open to the public, the publication of a classified telephone
   number is a crime.
   "This seems to smack of misprision, and police must start
   investigating it when an application is filed," Glaase said.
   According to the Eesti Paevaleht report a CD-ROM with the illegal
   database costs about 50,000 kroons. The paper claimed that the pirated
   information is a powerful weapon in the hands of criminals.
   Security police general director Juri Pihl and central criminal police
   acting assistant director Andres Anvelt confirmed there was
   black-market traffic in many institutions' databases.
   Pihl said that the security police would launch an inquiry into the
   information leak if it also concerned the security police. He said
   investigation of database theft was not an immediate task of the
   security police.
   According to the criminal code, the potential punishment for
   destroying or manipulating with other people's electronically recorded
   information is punishable with a prison sentence for a term of up to
   one year.

ESTONIAN CABINET EXPRESSES SHOCK AT GOVERNMENT DATA LEAK
   TALLINN, Nov 12, BNS - The Estonian Cabinet is shocked by the

   "It is a complicated problem and the Cabinet is shocked by it," Kallas

   Kallas said that in the nearest future the Cabinet would adopt a
   decision obliging state institutions to protect the information at
   their disposal. "The security systems and leaking connections must be    checked," he said.
   The acting prime minister said that it was important to establish how,
   by which channels and through whom the information came to the black
   market.

ESTONIAN POLICE QUESTION FIRST PEOPLE IN DATABASES LEAK CASE
   TALLINN, Nov 13, BNS - Estonian police Tuesday questioned several     people in connection with criminal action brought in the databases
   leak case.
   An interview with an alleged author of the black market databases,
   Imre Perli, has been scheduled for Wednesday.
   Tallinn police deputy prefect Peeter Sults told BNS that investigators
   had contacted Perli by telephone and he had promised to come for an
   interview.
   "Perli is not a suspect," Sults said. "Criminal action was brought    concerning the fact of the leak, not any concrete person."
   Sults said the perons interviewed were connected with institutions
   from which information had allegedly leaked out.
   The Tallinn criminal police brought criminal action in the classified
   information leak case on Tuesday. The action was taken concerning
   violations of regulations of government register keeping or of the use
   of the information contained in such registers. The punishment
   stipulated for this in the criminal code is a fine or a prison     sentence for a term of up to two years.
   The press has claimed that most of the classified databases were
   compiled by Perli, until September an Eesti Mobiiltelefon mobile
   telephone company employee. He may also have compiled the motor
   vehicles register database by which car owners can be established.
   Databases containing thousands of mobile and ordinary telephone     numbers, traffic offences, as well as data of the motor vehicles and
   companies registers are currently being offered for sale in Estonia.
   Such databases are of high value for organized crime.

So how useful are things like e-mail messages and newsgroup postings in
court? Can e-mail really be used as court evidence and has it actually
been used in any cases? It might probably differ in different coutries and
states, but there must be some generl opinion about this. Is it may be up
to the police / court to decide if a message is really written by someone
who's name is under there. You can easily forge e-mail, mail headers and
mail logs.

Are there any numbers available about different countries that have web
banking services, how many banks there are in each country, how many
people are using the services, and may be a URL of the bank. If you know
this kind of data, please mail it to me, when I put together the list I
will make a summary of it.
Like in Estonia 3 banks of 11 have Internet banking services available, at
least the same amount will follow soon, and about 1% of country's
population is using Internet banking services. Jyri Kaljundi

Which reminds me of a cryptochip done here in Estonia, which does 768-bit
RSA encryption / key exchange and 10Mbps 128-bit IDEA. It should be fairly
easy to change RSA length to 1024 or 2048. If someone is curious about the
price I could find it out.

How do the US export restrictions affect investments into non-US crypto
companies? Is it legal for US private persons or companies to invest money
into companies developing strong crypto applications for example in
Europe? Since Sun bought the Russian Elvis+ company it seems to be Ok, just wanted
to check if there are any other opinions. Does anyone know of any other
non-US companies that have received US investments, or venture capital or

Yes this is the case, Sun owns 10% of Elvis+ (a Russian company). Besides
that there is Russia Communications Research, Inc. (a California
corporation), which seems to be the sales part of Elvis+. Anyway the
question was about if an US company can invest in a crypto company, and
the answer was yes. Percentages are not so important. And sorry for saying
"Sun bought Elvis+".

Now that Crowds 1.1 is released, I had another look and it seems it is

Where did you get the information that: "permit from the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs is required for export and for transit through Estonia." ? I find it pretty hard to believe, because our company as probably the
leading security software reseller has imported and exported every kind of
crypto software to and from Estonia and done transit through Estonia. Or
could someone point me to the source of the sentence in your crypto law

I wonder what effect the Wassenaar politics have to non-member countries
of that agreement and how much those other countries support these US
crypto regulations? As I understand Wassenaar is mostly meant for export
of dual-use goods, not so much internal use although that is somewhat
regulated also. If that is the case, we still have many countries left
producing strong cryptography which can export it pretty freely. That is a
great export potential for those countries, only US used to be out of the
world crypto software market, now that there are 22 other countries, it is
just great news.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania fortunately are not members of the Wassenaar
agreement. And then we have places like most of Asia, Africa and South

@_subject: Re: What was the quid pro quo for Wassenaar countries? 
Much more I believe it could have been the promise of US to allow the W
countries to use the Echelon system sometimes. Something like in case your
country needs access to the system, it might be possible to order this
service from US Echelon Co. Of course US either would allow it in cases
like international terrorism threats, not for spying on European political
organs, technological and development and research organisations US
probably is using it for today. And it could be just a promise by US. Why this thing might have worked would be because the level education and
understanding of US and European representatives at these issues (Echelon,
communications wiretapping) could be very different, so the non-US
politicians might have not understood what they were really voting on. And
of course the government of every country in the world is always happy if
it can spy on anyone. Sad that they do not understand that the crypto
software today is a little bit too advanced and freely available that who
wants can still use it. Jyri Kaljundi
