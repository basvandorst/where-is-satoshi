@_subject: credit card charges 
Peace @ bix.com has posted a Windows program mpj/public/pgcharge.zip to
ftp.csn.org that will create an order with a credit card using X12
formats that will be signed and encrypted with PGP and then sent to a
mailer.   The posting asks for volunteers to serve as alpha testers for
the program.

Look at mpj/pub/pgcharge.zip in ftp.csn.ofg.  It was designed to do
that sort of thing.

Matt and Cypherpunks, etal.
I have been designing secure crypto modules for many years.  The
primary difficulty has been getting anyone to shell out the money to
buy them.  Perhaps things will be different with PC Cards.
Peace. Tom

@_subject: Does PGP scale well? 
Perry has repeated a litany here that I have been hearing for years on
the pem-dev list with never a hint of a justification.  That is that
PGP does not scale well.
One of the reasons that I consider this to be untrue is my empirical
experience with two groups that are constantly interested in exactly
who I am: the government and the credit bureaus.  They both chose to
use my SSN even though that has all the same attributes of a KeyID,
except that it is somewhat denser.  Now if this is what happens when
the real world tries to identify me, why is the KeyID such a bad way to
identify keys?
Please note that I do understand that identifying me and finding me are
separate issues.  I'm not sure that the pem-dev folk clearly
discriminate these.
Peace. Tom
