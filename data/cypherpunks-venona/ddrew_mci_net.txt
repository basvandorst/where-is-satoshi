To understand where "They" think they are coming from, you have to compare
Apples-to-Apples.  The concern is the medium of choice; the Internet and it's
high availability of anonymity, coupled with its access to large amounts of
computer systems available via one virtual channel.
A well orchestrated and well researched attack by the right folk, as the thought
process goes, could in-fact, potentially affect large amounts of critical
computer systems within a short period of time. And while the government
has inroads available to identify potential physical terrorists threats,
they do not feel as prepared for the virtual ones.

I think we are in violent agreement....
The item of issue, between physical and virtual terrorism attacks is the  fact the government either is, or wants to give the distinct perception that they are, ill-prepared to counter for the types of potentials wide-spread Internet-based virtual attacks.  And that the  intelligence channels they have in place to detect possible movement of physical attacks may not fit the "Internet" model.
In addition, the US legal system is ill-prepared to deal with the
prosecutory issues surrounding this type of "terrorism".
