I was using a Commodore 64 and a 300 bps modem for networking to the old
online services of the day.  That whole setup cost less than 300 dollars
at the time, and had a disk drive too.  I guess it would be feasable to
make a really cheap machine, fit it with a more modern modem and connect
it to the internet.
I feel sad when they say that the market for <1000 $ machines is nill, I had so much fun and learned so much from my old machines.

@_subject: [ecash] Re: Multi-issuer questions 
Am I right in assuming that the only reason Bank B has in contacting Bank
A is to confirm that the ecash hasn't been double spent?  Once that is
confirmed, there should be no need for contact between the two banks. Bank A should not have to credit Bank B's account as there has been no
transfer from Bank A to Bank B.  The transfer has been the deposit from
Bank B's customer to Bank B. Bank B is allready "credited", i.e., its (e)cash researves have increased, the moment Bank A confirms that the ecash is valid.
But this also makes a second assumption: that ecash is truly an open standard, i.e., that ecash is a "widely acceptable means of payment."  Any ecash issuing bank must be obligated to accept customer ecash deposits with one and only one condition: that the originally issuing bank must validate it.
Now what if this weren't so?  What if Bank B said "I didn't originally
issue this ecash and thus, I wont accept its deposit."  Now this puts the
"cashness" of ecash into some jeopardy. It doesn't immediately make ecash useless, but it puts an auxiliary condition to it.  This concerns the difference between Validation and Acceptance.  Validation is when Bank B checks the ecash with its original issuer to see if it has been double spent.  Acceptance is actually accepting that ecash as a deposit.  If Bank B refuses to Validate any non-Bank-B ecash then ecash pretty much
fails.  Period.  How would Bank B's customer be able to handle commerce
with non-Bank-B buyers?  By having multiple accounts with multiple Banks? What if the number of ecash issuers mushrooms into the hundreds?  In
anology, would you want to have to have accounts in 500 banks if your
customers also used 500 different banks?  The other alternitive for the
ecash case would be if Bank-B's-customer could bypass Bank-B by validating
the ecash directly with Bank A.  If it passes, then he must now look at the matter of Acceptance.
Now Bank-B's-customer knows that the ecash is valid.  He keeps it
temporarily in his hard disk.  But will Bank B ever Accept it as a
deposit?  If it doesn't, then Bank-B's-customer needn't worry that much. He can just use that ecash for transactions purpases.  Just because you
can't deposit every cent of cash that you earn doesn't mean that your cash
is worthless.  The fundamental test of ecash is whether merchants/customer
will accept it.  Of course, there is also important value in checking if
Banks will accept deposits of it, but I consider that secondary. So some concluding topics include:
+ independant verification of ecash.  some formal system for ecash
merchants (sellers) to check directly with the issuing bank that the ecash hasn't been double spent.
+ interbank verification of ecash.  formal interbank system for the
cleints bank to check the issuing bank to see if the ecash hasn't been
double spent. + interbank acceptance of ecash.  formal acceptance of verified ecash deposits, no matter the issuing bank.
The type of verification doesn't really matter that much.  Some sort of distributed method of resolving ecash issuers has to be standardized (say like the DNS, each ecash coin has some information as to the issuer.  person/bank that wants to verify just transmits that ecash to its original issuer and then receives a reply saying: verified (usable) or not (double spent).
The interbank acceptance issue is more important, but digicash (the
company) has some power here.  If they really aim at ecash beeing true
cash (instead of checking), then they gotta force all issuing banks to
accept ecash deposits nomatter the original issuer.  Like the Real Life
cash system: all banks accept cash, even though it is the federal researve
that was the original issuer.

bank has the right to use your deposits to give out loans.  When you
withdraw your money (and turn it into either cash or ecash) they (the
bank) no longer have the right to turn your deposits into loans. Withdrawn cash/ecash can not earn interest.
This is the problem of (e)cash: if you have it on hand you _must_ forgo
any interest earnings.  Theoretically, the optimum holding of (e)cash is a
function of interest rate (the greater the interest rate, the less cash on
hand), transaction cost of making withdrawals (the easier and more
convenient the withdrawals, the less cash on hand), and the "providence
value" of cash (the more you value instant gratification, the more cash on
hand). Thats why ATM machines have caused us to hold less cash.  We can now keep
money in the bank (letting it earn interest and letting the bank create
loans with it) and withdraw from ATM terminals only when we need it.

sorry if this is a little late.....
Not exactly currency exchange.  More like simple exchange.  Don't confuse
"issuing ecash" with "exchanging ecash for cash".  Issuing implies that
you have assets to back up the ecash.  Exchange only means that your
giving up your ecash for an equivalent amount of cash. Anybody could conceivably "exchange ecash".  Only "banks", who back up your money by law and researves can "issue ecash".

But you're not issuing ecash, you're just exchanging it.  Do the
blackmarket money changers of many countries issue cash?  No, the
governments do that.  The governments may outlaw the practice, but its
still done coz of the government's inneffiencies. But MT is the issuer, they actually create the money from your original
deposits.  They can't issue ecash without user deposits.

NO!  money could still earn interest untill it is _withdrawn_.  This includes withdrawals from MTB accounts into the Mint.  Coz ecash in any form (whether in the mint or in the HDD) is equivalent to cash.  And cash (by definition) cant earn interest.

I wrote a paper on the economic aspects of ecash and other electronic
cashes last month.  I believe I posted it onto cypherpunks.  Main
conclusion was that ecash is equivalent to cash in terms of bank practice
and money supply.  I'll send you a copy if you want.  Not seen any mention
in the academic press though (either of my paper or of any others). PS the ecash mailing list is low volume and pretty focused.  discusses
securty and economics and stuff.

And The Economist wisely puts notices warning readers to use there own
discretion on such services.  Great mag, it gave some of the best and sanest articles on the internet ever printed in the "popular press".
Beside there rather ambigous value as "asset protection" and "tax
sheltering", the main reason people use offshore banking is to gain better
interest rates.
In Thailand, the Bangkok International Banking Facility offers interest
rates on deposits that are several percentages higher than normal banks. The banks of the facility work under a different set of banking laws from
normal banks.  Also, the interest rate on loans also tends to be lower. I'm not sure whether international funds are subject to local (thai) or
international (us) tort judgements though, but many of the banks in the
BiBF advertise to offer high privacy and security.

This model isn't as practical as it seems.  For one thing, it is a classic
case of barter: exchange for things that you want but don't have.  This
becomes extremely difficult with specialization.  Letsay I make only
CryptoDoom, its the only thing that I have the skills to make.  The things
that I want but can't produce each day are numerous: food, transport,
housing, ad infinitum.  One-to-one barter is only usefull if both agents
(in a 2 agent economy) need only 2 goods and specialize.
This is the root of money: a means of exchange between heterogenous
products.  Allthough a parallel digital internetwork would allow
occasional barters to increase there viability, it does not mean that
barter will replace money.  But there's some ambiguity here: What is
implied by "The case of parallel digital currencies this exchange market
would...."?  Does this recomend exchange markets (barter) or fiat
(currency)?
