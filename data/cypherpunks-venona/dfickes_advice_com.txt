@_subject: The boss is watching... 
I've just been contacted by the producer of a cable news/analysis
 program who is putting together a show focusing on employees fooling
 around on the Web and what employers can do about it. (Trust their
 employees?).  She is very interested in stories and tales of employers who have
 taken action against employee "abuse" but also is looking for  companies that have policies that satisfy the "auditors" without  becoming "onerous." She has convinced me that she is interested  in presenting a balanced report and I've offered to gather whatever
 information I can lay my hands on before Feb 2.
 Incidentally, I was contacted because of my work on the announcement
 of "Internet WatchDog", a computer monitoring tool, which was  previously mentioned on the list.  Thanks for your help in advance...
 regards, -d
