Synchronicity! [argh] I had been considering making a posting along
the same lines. Note that the form required [EXT 1042(09/93)] has a
$15 processing fee. (Which might be peanuts if we're selling a
frigate, but which is a royal pain for a piece of crypto.)
Page 1, "A guide to Canada's Export Controls", April 1994
General "Software" Note
This list does not embargo "software" which is either:
1.	Generally available to the public by being:
2.	"In the public domain".
Excerpts relating to Canadian Export controls on cryptography should
be up somewhere off towards the end of the week.

@_subject: Canadian Export Controls 
This is a notification of the first creation of a few pages describing
Canadian Export Controls. Any one who has read the printed document
[Canada's Export Controls] will realise that it's almot word-for-word,
but there's some use for that.
In any case, they currently live at
It may be that they'll move, but
should always have a pointer to them.
comments, bugs, spelling errors, contributions to rmartin
The pages were written this evening. Tomorrow morning I'll look at them,
scream, wonder what I was thinking, and rewrite them. This is so that
there'll be a few more screams. :)

On Jul 31, 11:51pm, Dr. Frederick B. Cohen wrote of his experiences at
the Canada-USA border:
Until a few years ago, carrying software across the border from the states
to Canada, one would only pay duty on the value of the media. Canadian
Customs regulations did not recognise any value in the information
contained on the floppies. I haven't actively exported/imported software
in this manner recently (well, I carried 2.6ui to Mobile and back without
realising it (or, indeed, ever putting it in a drive) and so broke ITAR)
so I'm not sure how things stand currently.
I think they might actually have been convinced of the value of software.
[Department of External Affairs and International Trade has been, as noted
earlier. Danger of software, at least.]
