My company is hiring for two positions, a Senior Software Engineer
and a Software Technician.  We want to hire these people as soon as
we can, but are looking for first-quality personnel.  I would appreciate
your passing these on to people you believe are appropriate.  Here are the net postings on the two positions.

recognize printed information faster and more accurately.     We are looking for a full-time, senior engineer. This inventor will
be a part of a small team.  An excellent working relationship with the
others is important.  The candidate must be fun to work with, creative
and enjoy meeting the commitments we make to our customers.

Can any of you help us with this mess?  Linux is not my strong suit. Thanks!  My engineer is pulling his hair out.  I would appreciate any
suggestions anyone could make.
