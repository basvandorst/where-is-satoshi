post the jist of his response when I get it.  I had made a 50MB partition
and got only 18MB out of it.. but a 1MB partition gave me a full MB.  I
assume it's another problem with MKVOLUME.  The one released with 1.1
had a limit of 8MB.. maybe this release has some ratio limit problem.. to look at it right now but I'd easily miss weaknesses in the implementation
of IDEA. P.S. are Tacky Tokens still being processed?  I never got any response to
my GIF FOR SALE post a while back.  It's only 5 tt. so get two today.

Personal information can be airbrushed out.  Holograms may be tricky..
maybe it'll look ok.. just for reference of course.  something out.  TTFN..
