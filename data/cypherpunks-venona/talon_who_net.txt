Does anyone know what I should do if someone was posting sensitive
information on a website?
And what if the webmaster of the domain doesnt respond to the request for
removal of information.
IS there something that say's what is and isn't able to be published
"personal information" on the internet.
If someone can reply I'd appreciate it.
Seeking council.
