I truly hope you don't stereotype all AOL users for this idiot's insane
Unfortunately, some people are just morons, but you get them on every ISP
anyway, they just aren't so obvious on others, because unfortunately, AOL
makes it easier to communicate.

Obviously you have a very high opinion of yourself and a low opinion of people
who use AOL.  Contrary to popular belief, there are a few intelligent people
on AOL, but it looks as if you are too egotistical to realize that.
Have you ever thought to look at your own mistakes before you publicize
everyone else's to the world?  Are you just suffering from some sort of
dillusion of grandeur - thinking you are better than everyone else.  Things
like this are what many wars were started over, I am so happy the internet
(hopefully) won't start a war in the real world.

@_author: finally 
@_subject: Re: Larry Gilbert, AOLers, and the Hyper-real flamer 
Actually.. I am getting a SunOS Shell account this weekend.  AOL has improved
service somewhat, and it is now possible to use Netscape (or any other
browser) along with it.
I also have over 100 accounts on a local ISP - so trust me... it's not that
big of a deal for me to get another ISP, I just like some of the keywords and
a few other areas.
As for your thought that it is a CHOICE for everyone... well, I am sorry to
say it is not.  My parent would rather use the [semi]- user-friendly software
of AOL, which she is familiar with, than have a dialup access with browsers
and other utilities in different areas she can't find as easily.  (I know, it
sounds stupid.)
I was finally able to convince her to pay for a shell account, promising her I
would teach her how to use it.
As for me paying it... I just became old enough to work (finally) about a
month ago, and I am only making minimum wage, and the hours are not good
enough for me to be able to keep up my hobbies of paintball, computer
upgrades, and Internet alone.
Therefore... she pays for it, I wash dishes...
So anyway... before I get too sidetracked, I am just saying... I am finally
getting a shell account, and not all AOLers are stupid warez lovers that don't
know cu from cd.
I would also like to add - I wasn't even talking about AOL service (although I
agree it is really crappy - but a tad better than it used to be) I was just
talking about the insults to all AOL user's Intelligence.
I am sure there are morons on other ISP's, they are just more visible on AOL.

All Creatures Great and Small - that one... =)
I also read an Aasimov a while back in fifth grade - unfortunately, I can't
remember even the name... I need to pick some of his books up again... One book I can remember reading since 5th grade (and every summer thereafter)
is "IT" by Stephen King - one of his few really good books.  I have read it 8
times since.
I greatly recommend it =)

@_author: but not sure 
@_subject: Re: Larry Gilbert, AOLers, and the Hyper-real flamer 
In a message dated 98-09-15 23:06:12 EDT, you write:
I know... I noticed that just when I hit the send button.  Hmm, where you ever
an English teacher... maybe named Mrs. Braly?
Anyway... I don't type like an idiot, as I HAVE seen.
I also rarely ever reply to someone, so I forget all about the quotes when I
do, I am sorry for that mistake.  Hopefully it is corrected to everyone on the
internet's liking above.
I think (but not sure) that you are trying to put words in my mouth with the
following statement: Well, I never said anything like that.  Actually, I only like a few things
about AOL, but I know it is NOT _the_ Internet.  I also know that NO ISP is
_the_ Internet.  It is a collection of protocols, etc.  Next time, don't put
words in my mouth.  Someone once said (I can't remember who exactly),
The greatest threat to manipulators are the people who think for themselves.
So, I really don't CARE what you say about me, or too me.  It really has no
meaning to me.  Oh, and maybe it will give you some wierd joy to know that I _am_ switching
ISP's soon, to dfw.net, with SunOS shell account =)
Well, enough of replying to your insults, or what I took to be insults.  I
need to read a little.

P.S.  Grow up... quit berating people because of an ISP that they MAY not even
have had a choice on... did you ever think of that?

Hmm... have you ever thought... that my mother may not exactly love the idea
of me having access to other people's accounts... so I need to do what she
DOES condone?  You just don't seem to be using your brain.

Hmm, well, you were wrong about many things.
The ISP runs RH5.1
I don't use the passwd file for anything, as it is shadowed.
I don't work there.
I use 100 accounts because it is so easy to get all the new users, and the
changed passwords with the way they are set up, so why stop at one, and if
that one is disabled, I would like something to fall back on.  You just don't understand anything about why I do what I do.  If you were
illegally using an account, would you want to ONLY have 1?  Why wouldn't you
want to know you had something to fall back on if that one is disabled?

wow.. you really do think I do all those things - spamming, mailbombing... and
all that other huh?
You really give me way to much credit, as I only use it for internet access,
and access to a UNIX machine
