Oh so carefully worded PR BS:
"It also represents the first time in more than 20 years that the owner of UNIX technology has provided the operating system free of charge to the Note "owner of UNIX technology"
They make it sound like noone without a multimillion dollar budget could
ever get UNIX before. What a crock.
It's good to see them making it free, but there are far better free
system already IMO (Linux, FreeBSD, etc).

Well I'm just grumpy enough right now to tear this apart... :)
An debatable but valid assumption.
How is a non-heap defined? 1 grain? 0 grains? If (2) is to be true, it can't be 0, since you assumed (1), so a non-heap must be 1 grain.
Huh? How do you draw that conclusion? (1) and (2) are not contradictory in
any way. You said 1 grain is not a heap, but >1 is. Fine. Valid way of
defining a heap/non-heap of sand. Nothing to do with (3).
Very debatable. Very general.
Very debatable.
Rubbish. If the government removes all liberties at once, that's oppressive, but if they do it one at a time, it's not?
More Rubbish. Not only are your assumptions flawed, but the heap
argument and the oppression argument are entirely unrelated.
Nothing personal, mind you. :)

I have seen many a post more foolish that was intended in all seriousness.
My point is that neither your first nor second arguments are a paradox, nor do they relate to one another. I agree that many people may not
see their freedoms being whittled away, simply because they are being
whittled away, as opposed to eliminated all at once. If that is your
point however, it was unclear. Apologies if you were upset by my response.

@_subject: Re: What are the flaws with FV payment system? 
I haven't seen any such analysis myself, but there is likely one available.
- From looking at FV's claims and descriptions of transactions, here's
a few things I'd say:
 o A buyer's VirtualPIN is given insecurely to the merchant, unless
   transmitted via secure HTTP. If not over SSL or HTTPS, anyone along
   the way can swipe the VirtualPIN.
 o It is easy to "verify" a PIN as a valid PIN. You can use finger, telnet,
   and email among other things. Easy target for a dictionary attack.
 o Payment confirmation messages are sent to the buyer via email,    unencrypted, insecure, etc... Easy target for slightly-less-than-honest
   system admins, and most anyone else between FV and the buyer. Easy    traffic analysis, though the FV payment scheme does not offer    anonymity as a feature. Absolutely zero privacy.
 o Read this:    Nuff said.
 o It appears that anyone can fake a reply to a payment confirmation
   message. It appears some sort of transaction id is necessary in the reply,
   but it's not entirely evident. (the id comes in the comfirmation
   request if it does exist, you wouldn't need any other knowledge).
 o Given the above, it doesn't seem hard to spoof either merchant requests
   and/or buyer confirmations, charging the real VirtualPIN-holder without
   his/her knowledge. If the confirmation-request email could be prevented
   from reaching the intended user, they would never even know it happened,
   til they get their credit-card bill.
 o Logistically, it requires a user has access to his/her email account
   at all times to make purchases. For a timely purchase, it requires a
   user to receive the confirmation-request quickly, and the reply to
   reach FV quickly. Every ISP I've used has noticeable lag handling mail
   at times, often minutes long. Mail queues get big.
 o On the plus side, you send your credit card info over the incredibly,
   massively, montrously secure phone lines by calling these people up. ;-)
This is all from looking over their pages for a few minutes a while back,
and quicky just now, so I may have erred in places. Someone with experience
using the system and/or someone with FV's email message specs would be good
to talk to.
The claims they make about encryption just generally make me want to dislike
them immensely, regardless of the merits of their system.

For those of you who use mailcrypt (Emacs-PGP interface) for email, I
have hacked in support for pseudonyms ala nym.alias.net. In fact,
the code has nym.alias.net hardcoded for now. I'm gonna add more stuff,
but I'm just letting this out as is.
This patch affects mailcrypt.el and mc-remail.el. I made these changes
to mailcrypt 3.4, so your mileage may vary on other versions. I did
this after the C2 party tonight, so typos and bugs are possible. Please
email me if bugs are found. "This value is not configureable" does not
qualify, I know it's not configureable yet.
(BTW there are a couple functions not used, I was doing it one way, then
changed my way of thinking, but the code is ok so I left it.)
Installing it:
 o cd to your lisp directory
 o cat /path/to/the/patch | patch -p0, or something similar
   (You will need to pgp this message before extracting the patch
    to get rid of the leading "- " on some lines.)
 o recompile the .el files, ala:
   emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile mc-remail.el
   emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile mailcrypt.el
Using it:
 o You _must_ have a remailer chain defined. This does not work
   with a single remailer (though a chain of length 1 might work).
 o Compose a message or reply as normal. Once you are done (the message
   would go out without nyms or remailers or anything if you hit
   C-c C-c), hit C-c / n.
 o The first question asks for a remailer chain, it will do completions.
 o The second question asks for the name of your nym. This is assumed
   to be  DO NOT include  If your nym
   is jimbob just answer jimbob. This does not do    completions at the moment. Putting your nym in your .emacs file
   is a bit weird anyway.
 o You will be asked for a signature for your nym's private key.
 o The message will be rewritten to send and then
   to the remailer chain you chose.
 o Send it.
Hack the code at will, if you make significant enhancements, please
email patches to me. Of course there is no warranty of any sort, if
it blows up your machine you're out a machine.
I will put this on my web page (
for those that prefer that.

@_subject: pgpfingerd 
For what it's worth, I wrote a very short fingerd that fetches _only_
a user's .pgpplan file, should it exist. Else it just exits. Someone
may have already done this, so be it. This was mostly for my own use,
but if anyone wants the code, feel free to use it. It's available from
my home page (  ).
After calling getpwnam() on the username supplied, it calls setuid() with
the uid of the user being fingered. It ignores any finger options and
attempts to parse them out. It's possible I missed some. After setuid(),
it attempts to open a file called .pgpplan in the directory (pw_dir)
returned by getpwnam(). If this is not a _regular_ file, it exits, i.e.
no symlinks. Then it shoves the file out over stdout (this assumes it
was invoked by inetd). That's it.
I've only compiled it on Linux and BSDI, but it doesn't do anything very
odd, so it should compile fine on other Unix platforms.

As an additional forum, it's not a bad idea, with the exception that it

USENET is less accessible than email, and given the goals of cypherpunks,
the more accessible the medium the better. I have crap news access 99%
of the time, and I imagine a significant portion of the list is in a
similar situation. Also, the tools for news reading are not well-suited
for filtering, either manual or automatic.
These 3 are fatal IMO. The distribution of cypherpunks would become
much more haphazard and might fail altogether in places. Some people
will be reading long threads days after they are dead.
Agreed. These lists _are_ the alternative to the "open" cypherpunks list.
If a moderated cypherpunks is to be started, great, but it should be
another list, not _the_ cypherpunks list. Moderation, even with the best
intentions, is subjective, and therefore has no place on a list such
as cypherpunks.
If this is really an experiment, at the end of the month the list should
become unmoderated, and a moderated list created. Then we can see how many
people switch in that direction. I imagine it would be a similar number
to those that switched to the unedited list.
There is still much to be done. The cypherpunks list has plenty of reason
for being. As is, it 1) is still used as a forum for good discussion, despite the noise, and 2) is an invaluable resource for information retrieval and dispersal. The list should not be killed or moved IMO, and moderation should occur on other lists, not the main one.

Umm... reading your faq... ( you
state that you use the windows95 user password as the password for
encrypting files. You also seem to imply that you don't actually
_ask_ for the password, windows gives it to you (albeit hashed
or something already, I imagine). If that is the case, that is extremely
worrisome. In fact it's outrageous.
That would imply that any _other_ application, benign or evil, could
also access the same password and immediately decrypt files.
Is that so? (Not coding much on windows, I don't know if applications
can access the user's hashed or encrypted password, but I would guess
they could.)

Out of curiosity, do you know how the keys are protected by windoze
I have the CAPI cd but have had all of 5 minutes to look at it.  I would presume they're hashing your password into a key and then encrypting
with it, or encrypting another key with it. Any idea?
What is somewhat bothersome (and this would go for anything using CAPI
in the way your product does) is the reliance upon the windoze password.
If that were compromised, it seems all other CAPI integrated keys would
also be compromised. Let's hope they choose good passwords, and know not
to re-use the same one on the net somewhere. :-)
(BTW, does windoze allow arbitrary length passwords or phrases, or does
have a short limit?)
