@_subject: your bogus post 
We run an online mall.  We had been planning eventually to offer the
store owners the option of taking fv payment as well as credit card numbers.
After reading your recent post to cypherpunks, which I would say is
the most bogus post ever made on this bogus subject, we are determined *not* to use fv payment systems if we can possibly avoid it.
That post was news to no one.  The kind of attack you "discovered"
has been known about for years, and is just not a serious threat.
Your post was nothing but a calculated attempt to frighten end
users, and get publicity for fv.  A company capable of doing such irresponsible things is not one that we would trust with users' money.

marketing works, and companies have to use it to stay profitable.
I would not mind if fv made bogus claims in their press releases.  People expect that in press releases.  But I think that they should keep their press releases on their web site, where we can ignore them, instead of disguising them as "discoveries" in netnews.
  So, what do you think of their product?
No client or potential client of our online mall has ever asked us
to implement fv payment.  Everyone seems happy with credit cards.
I think that the people at fv could see what was happening, and this
ill-considered post was a desparate attempt to make everyone take fv
seriously.  In my case it had the opposite effect.
