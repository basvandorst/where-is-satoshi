@_subject: creating a v2.6 of PGP for the REST of us! 
If patches are going to be produced for PGP 2.3a for those of us outside the
USA who wish to send PGP encrypted data to USA users of v2.6, will the patches also enable a key from a patched 2.3a to be put onto a USA key-server that only accepts v2.6 keys - will the keys be labelled as v2.6?
I take it Pr0duct Cypher's patch doesn't include this?
Maybe instead of many people producing different patches (some of which will be good and some bad) a new version (labelled as v2.6euro?) should be released from outside the USA that is derived from 2.3a code; therefore producing a version that is no different in _appearance_ to MIT's v2.6. The point being that an 'ALL-NEW-SUPER-DUPER' version may attract more attention outside the USA than, as some may view it, 'just a pointless patch' would do.  Also, some ftp sites and bulletin boards outside the USA
don't like carrying software that was illegally exported.  A special non-USA version of 2.6 would allow everyone to be happy and compatible.
Wouldn't this create a unified world of compatible PGP users?

Ok, you got me there!  My supporting argument is indeed flawed.
However, I would say that most people _regard_ v2.3a as a legal version outside the USA and so are willing to carry it on their systems; and at this time I believe nothing concrete to the contrary has been proved.  Versions 2.5 and 2.6 however are obviously illegal exports, and I think that it is the fact that people think of one as legal and the other as illegal that makes the difference, and therefore we who are outside the USA need our own version to be brought up to date.
I have, at this time, been informed of two separate people working on a new version that is compatible with 2.6, based on 2.3a code.
Maybe everyone working on (or who know of people working on) such developments could post information regarding what exactly they are changing/upgrading/doing to 2.3a to make an 'international' v2.6.
What do others think of everyone 'putting their cards on the table' to enable other knowledgeable cypherpunks to help and suggest things?
Am I jumping the gun?  Should we just let MIT's v2.6 reach an FTP site somewhere outside of the USA and let it slowly (and cautiously) get distributed to a small community of cypherpunks leaving the rest incompatible?
All of those inside the USA, *PLEASE* get involved with this.  It _is_ Thankyou for listening.

Hey, I don't care if you Americans want to stick with v2.3a.  I just thought that you wouldn't be able to add your v2.3a key to USA keyservers and would therefore move onto v2.6 (not to mention that v2.3a infringes RSA's patents and some people like to stay legal).
The fact is some people will move onto v2.6 and I would like the ability to communicate with them.
