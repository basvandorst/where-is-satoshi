Is there some reason why lots of 'punks _aren't_ running a simple script that will, say, fire a message to one's self through a chain of remailers every time you log on or at random intervals or something?
This may be an imerfect solution to the problem of traffic analysis, but it's so uncomplicated that there seems no reason not to do it. And if there were fifty or a hundred people or so making a practice of this, it seems to be agreed that the remailers would be a great deal more secure than they are now.
This is a nice little opportunity for everybody to help out the remailer operators. God knows, this list seems to be capable of generating sufficient noise -- all we have to do is harness it :-). The question is, how much traffic is _too_ much? Recommendations from remailer people?

I read this as an invitation to rant. :-) This is going to be a little

I'm here for the crypto phase change.
I'm here because of a technological perception about computation in general and encryption in particular. Crypto is a lever. Crypto is about mechanical advantage, small actions with big consequences in the progress of a major
social change brought on by computation. Computers are changing the world
in a way comparable to the invention of iron, or the printing press, or
the steam engine. And cryptography is a pivotal point of influence in the
direction that society will take in the next fifty or a hundred years.

hughes (Eric Hughes):
One can only reach the conclusion that Usenet is broken if one assumes
that the remailers _aren't_. The automatic broadcast property if Usenet
is not a problem if you can always determine the source of a message. This
isn't an argument against anonymity, but just saying it's a little
backwards to say that Usenet has to be redesigned because it doesn't work
with the remailers.
Why not use technology to solve a technological problem? The difficulty here is that it is impossible for any one remailer operator to prevent someone, say LD, from using the remailer system. The best he can do is stop LD from using his site as an entry point. So why not introduce a little cooperation among operators? This can be accomplished without collusion of the sort that would break anonymity.
Pretty much all the remailer operators are 'punks, right? If a critical mass of operators get together and agree to block a standardized set of sources and destinations, then that group of operators will have enough pull to force the other operators to toe the line. The trick is to block messages from remailer _operators_ who refuse to agree to behave as part of the community, effectively isolating the wildcats. An isolated remailer is Should be easy enough to work out -- a posted alert PGP signed by any two remailer operators is immediately implemented, no questions asked. Remailer scripts should include blocking by source, destination, or _content_, as in posts on a certain subject to a certain newsgroup. This would allow blocking of a nutcase using encrypted hops to post to Usenet without having to collude and blow his anonymity. Just say "Sorry, due to abuse of the remailers, we're not going to forward messages about the creatures from Uranus using microwave mind-control any more". This is a complicated idea in a general case, but scanning for subject lines, for instance, could be implemented as easily as scanning for destinations.
What we have now is a bunch of single remailers. It's a very small step to create a cooperative group of remailers, and it would provide avenues for solutions to a lot of the potential problems. This is not perfect, but it's tytso (Theodore Ts'o):
LD is smart enough to know that you _chain_ remailers for anonymity. I think he wanted us to know it was him, and wanted to see whether or not Hal would blow his anonymity when it came down to it.

I write:
Looks to me like we substantially agree with one another, actually.
I might, however, throw out an additional concept, which, to me at least, is a very significant consideration. The basic reasoning of our government with regard to individual rights has always been that rights are agreed on by society as a whole, and one of the social roles of government is to act both as protector and _arbiter_ of those rights. I think this shows through every time somebody talks about "trade-offs" -- this is government acting as arbiter, trying to enforce an assumed role as the body charged with deciding what rights _mean_ in a practical social context.
Under many circumstances, this is an appropriate role: the government acts to protect free speech more often than it acts to suppress it, for instance. But the spooky illogic of Clipper comes, I think, from this model of rights as things the government can, but doesn't take away from its citizens. Cryptography breaks this paradigm, because privacy becomes something posessed by the citizen independent of the government's good will. Clipper is an effort to restore the traditional paradigm, to return the government quite literally to its traditional role of "keeper of the keys". It is a failure to recognize that the rules of the world are changing, and a failure to adapt.
This is more frightening in a lot of ways than any "Nixon-esque" intrigue could ever be.

Jim Choate is making a lot of strange statements, but I'm picking this
Sure they are, in Quantum Electrodynamics, which is the quantum-mechanical
theory of electromagnetism.
Quarks have nothing whatsoever to do with electromagnetic fields, except
that they carry charge.
No. Protons and neutrons are hadrons. Hadron comes from the (Greek?) word
for "heavy", lepton from "light". The distinction you're trying to make
here is that matter fields are _fermions_, with spins an integral multiple
of 1/2, and gauge fields (like photons) are bosons, with integral spin. Both hadrons and leptons are fermions.
Charge conservation applies to everybody. Hadrons, leptons, everybody. Even your mother. Perhaps you're thinking of the fact that bosons and fermions
obey different spin-statistics rules.
Not that this is the appropriate list for particle physics, but this kind
of semi-mystical expounding on how quantum mechanics forces you to rethink
all the rules is better science fiction than science. QM _does_ include
some spooky things, but by and large they are subtle and limited -- for
instance, the "faster than light communication" implied by spin-polarization
measurements cannot be used to transmit information. It's a purely statistical effect, and it does _not_ violate relativity.
Nothing I've ever heard of in QM invalidates assumptions one might make
about computability or the properties Turing machines. Stuff like Roger
Penrose comes up with in _The Emperor's New Mind_ is speculation, and he
clearly labeled it as such in his book. Don't take it too seriously.

Curve Encrypt is a freeware drag-and-drop encryption application for the Macintosh. It uses IDEA cipher-feedback mode with a 255 character pass phrase, encrypts both the data and resource forks of files, and will
encrypt the contents of a folder or volume in a single operation. Source
code is provided, natch. CE is System 7 only.
(Note that this program has nothing whatsoever to do with elliptic curve
encryption methods, just so nobody gets confused...)
NEW FOR 1.1
The following changes have been made for the 1.1 release:
o Faster encryption and decryption.
o Faster file wipes.
o Department of Defense standard file wiping is now an option.
o The "Use as default pass phrase" selection is no longer present. Instead, Curve Encrypt 1.1 uses keyfiles, a more reliable way to reuse pass phrases. oJCurve Encrypt now saves the creation and modification dates of files when they're encrypted, and restores them to their original values when a file is decrypted. o An incompatibility with the Super Boomerang utility has been fixed.

Certification really does need to be added to the discussion on scaling.
In the sense that I want to be able to download a stranger's key from a key server and have some idea of its reliablility, web of trust has
turned out to be a real failure, IMO. There's no "web", rather a large
set of disconnected "islands" of signatures. I'm looking at the latest
keyring from MIT right now, and noticing that most of the keys are
either unsigned or self-signed. The majority of the rest have signatures,
but signatures that are unconnected to me via the web of trust, so that
they are entirely useless. I suspect that my situation is by far the
most common one: the only keys that I have any verifiable authentication
for are ones I've signed myself, or ones that are signed by people in my immediate circle. The chain of signatures dies very close to me.
This isn't a criticism of PGP's key certification paradigm -- PGP allows
centralized certification (I see a few keys signed by SLED, for instance),
and it also allows me the flexibility of having mutual certification within
the circle of people I mail regularly. But web of trust _in and of itself_
is not proving to be effective when applied to the problem of providing
reliable key certification on the scale of the internet as a whole.                                   -- Will

Perhaps you're right. Your argument here, as I see it, is that web-of-trust
becomes _more_ functional as it becomes adopted on a larger scale. This
might end up being true and it might not, although there seems to be
no evidence as of yet of increasing "connectivity" of signatures as PGP
becomes more widely used, which was the point I was trying to make. The
unresolved question is whether or not there will be a critical point at
which the web will become widely connected. The answer does not seem at
all clear to me.

Hal Finney writes, in regard to web-of-trust:
There are, however, degrees of certainty here. The only person I trust
implicitly to sign keys is myself. If I have a key which is separated from
me by more than one hop in the web of trust, but still connected to me
via a chain of signatures, I have more certainty that this key is valid
than I do for an unsigned key. Granted, if I don't know the actual signator
of a particular key, my level of trust in the key's validity is pretty
low, but it's nonzero as long as it's connected by a chain of signatures.
The ease of mounting of a man-in-the-middle attack decreases with increasing signature connectivity, no?
Of course, the reality is that use of totally unverified PGP keys is
widespread, even among people who are well educated on the subject. This
is not a good thing in the long run.

What I do in Curve Encrypt for the Mac is use the MD5 of the pass phrase,
a 128-bit random salt (overkill is cheap here) and a one-byte counter field
passed repeatedly through MD5, like this:
 = MD5[]
 = 128 bits of randoms
 = 0
for (a tenth of a second)
 = MD5Final()
At startup, the program determines how many iterations of MD5Update can be
accomplished in a tenth of a second on the current CPU, and the loop is run
that many times. The number of iterations and the salt are stored with the
encrypted file, in the clear. The point to the concatenation is that this buffer is 65 bytes long, and MD5 works on 64-bit
blocks, so that the buffer is shifted by one byte in the MD5 block each
iteration, making precomputation of the MD5 addition steps more of a pain.
Also note that the buffer is _not_ repeatedly MD5-hashed, but repeatedly sent
to MD5Update() instead. This is out of fear that there might be fixed-points
in the hash algorithm.

Colin's code, independent of implementation, simply uses MD5 as a block
cipher to "launder" bit-streams that contain non-uniform distributions of
true random data. See "Truly Random Numbers" in Dr. Dobb's Journal, November 1994,  p. 113. How much entropy you get out depends entirely on what you
feed in. I've put my code up on the cypherpunks ftp site, but I'm still waiting to
hear back from the site maintainers as to its final location. In any case,
that code uses the mouse _position_ and system timings in microseconds as
input to the MD5 engine. So swirling the mouse should provide a good source
of random input, better the faster it's moved. However, any code that generates random session keys should properly include
routines to estimate the amount of entropy collected, and not generate a
128-bit key until at least 128 bits of entropy have been fed into the pool.
This is a non-trivial problem, although PGP makes a good stab at it. To my
knowledge, CryptDisk does not include this feature, and really ought to. For
my own purposes in Curve Encrypt, this is not necessary, since I don't generate session keys, only salts.

At a party last night, I ran into a couple of acquantances, and was delighted to learn that they are working on the current NIST quantum computing
project, making quantum gates out of atomic traps similar to those used
by Cornell and Weiman to get a Bose condensate with Rubidium (crypto relevance
comes from odd places, eh?) Anyway, I talked them up a bit, and so far they've
managed to construct a working "or" gate. The long-term project is to construct
a quantum computer capable of factoring 15, which they expect to take at
least several years.
I mentioned crypto and they literally laughed at me. The word from the trenches is "don't worry about it for a very long time."

@_subject: ANNOUNCE: Curve Encrypt 2.2 
Curve Encrypt version 2.2 is now available.
Curve Encrypt is a program for encrypting files on a Macintosh so that they cannot be read without a pass phrase. It works on files, folders or whole volumes, and supports the IDEA and triple-DES encryption algorithms. CE also supports Aladdin's StuffIt Engine for data compression. Full source code is provided. System 7 only.
NEW FOR 2.2
The following changes have been made for the 2.2 release:
* When wiping free space on a volume, Curve Encrypt 2.2 now also wipes unused space in allocated blocks.
* Curve Encrypt 2.2 comes with both PowerPC native and 68K versions.
FTP SITES
Curve Encrypt is available with source at the following FTP sites:
This is an export controlled ftp site: read /pub/crypt/GETTING_ACCESS for
information on access.
ftp.csn.org is also export-controlled: read /mpj/README for the characters to replace ???????.

@_subject: Re: PKZIP - Encryption 
I think the point is that the postulate is true only because the people
who write "convenient" software usually either don't have a proper clue
about security or are afraid of crossing ITAR. Secure encryption algorithms
are intrinsically no less convenient than insecure ones. Quite the opposite,
from what I've seen: secure algorithms tend toward simplicity, because
it's easier to prove theorems with a simple algorithm than with a convoluted one. RC4 is a fine example of this, astonishingly uncomplicated.
It's as easy to drop IDEA into a compression/archiving utility as it is
to put in the dreaded "proprietary" algorithm. Easier. And if you don't want
to pay the licensing fees, use Blowfish or 3-DES. Why these companies don't
is a anybody's guess. Take the example of StuffIt on the Mac, which
started out with DES and moved to some internally produced algorithm for
reasons no one at Aladdin has been willing to explain to me, even when
I asked with relative bluntness. Evidently, it was worth some trouble to
them to _reduce_ their security, of all things. That is a sad, sad situation. (No particular flame on Aladdin, other than the obvious technical one. They're
a fine bunch of folks, from my experience.)

Woah. What a radical idea.
Have any of the people busily working away at web pages slamming Netscape
actually bothered to verify that Jim Clark actually said any of the things
he is rumored to have said? I haven't seen any documentation of anything
from what I would consider to be a reliable source. If you want to generate publicity about something, you better make damn
sure your facts are correct, or you'll end up looking like an idiot. Complaining that Clark didn't deny it isn't good enough.

@_subject: Re: Why Americans feel no compulsion to learn foreign languages 
Entirely brushing aside the idea that there might be more to the world than
technical fields, my observation has been that knowing at least one
foreign language would be an enormous professional advantage. At one
computer company I worked for, the only person who could speak Italian was
in constant demand as an informal translator. Doing research, I have had
a number of occasions to regret my lack of proficiency with a foreign
language. I regularly come into contact with German and Spanish speaking
scientists. (Probably number one on the hit parade is Chinese, but I'm
kind of daunted by the idea of taking it on ;-). Granted, English is
the technical lingua franca, but the statement that there's no point in
learning a foreign language is shortsighted, and I think that will become
more true, not less, in the future.
And besides, you only need Spanish for maids, gardeners, and day-laborers,
