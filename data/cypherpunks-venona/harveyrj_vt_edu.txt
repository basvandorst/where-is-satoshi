unfortunately, it doesn't say WHAT that legislation might be!  the copyright on the manual is June 1993.

Having been naive enough to actually read a number of his posts

be amazed if "Dr. Sternlight" was indeed a 'highly placed' govt

@_subject: something NOT MIME-related 
Not to distract from the entertaining MIME thread, but I've got a question that's a little closer to a crypto topic (i.e., software
psueudo-random number generators).     In the aftermath of the Pentium-can't-divide-accurately flap, I modified
a random-number generation routine I'd written to check for the presence
of the Pentium divide errors.  In the process, I put in a routine that
did an elementary benchmarking of the chip's performance in both integer
(speed to repeatedly execute an empty for-loop 1 million times) and floating point operations (inserting a divide operation in the loop, and adjusting
the resulting execution time by subtracting the time required for the empty loop before computing divide-calculations-per-second performance).  This is an admittedly very crude benchmark, but I wanted to get some rough idea how many divides could be performed per minute of program
execution (i.e., to estimate how long the program could run before a
Pentium-problem might occur).
   Anyway, I found what appeared to be very strange results when comparing performance on my 486/66 versus a 486/25 and 386/20:  namely,
although the 386 was dead last on both the primarily integer-based empty-
for-loop and for-loop-with-divide timings, the 486/25 and 486/66 turned
in effectively identical times in the empty-loop benchmark (the 486/66 was
about 33% faster than the 486/25 in the divide-based benchmark).  All
machines were running essentially equivalent versions of Windows for    My question is, why would the 486/66 and 25 produce comparable integer-
based empty loop performance?  I haven't tried a comparable program running
under plain-DOS to see if this is somehow Windows related.  I supsect there's
an easy explanation, but it escapes me.  Any suggestions would be greatly R. J. Harvey                               (mail: harveyrj

My reading of that page suggests a somewhat different motive
and interpretation:  what they seem to be doing is copying the
Microsoft approach with respect to setting criteria that must be
met before you can use their logo on your page/product.  It doesn't prohibit putting links to their download page; it just prohibits
using their "Netscape Now!" logo without their permission.
  Note the criteria for being allowed to use their logo:  you
have to design your server to break with the current "standards"
(e.g., CGI) and embrace Netscape's extensions (e.g., backgrounds;
client pull/server push, SSL encrypted transactions), which they would like to foist on us as the new "standard."
  Essentially, they want us to help them create the perception
that if you don't show the "Netscape Now!" flag (didn't Nixon have
a similar slogan?) on your page, that you're just not a high-
quality operation.  Or maybe they're trying to change the subject
from the unfortunate publicity from the success of SSL Challenge...

Today I attended the Telecommunications Conference here in Blacksburg sponsored by Rep. Rick Boucher (D-VA), in which an interesting cast of
(including Clarence Irving, Asst Secretary of Commerce for Telecommunication Policy, and presidents and Sr. VPs of Sprint, Time-Warner, GTE, Bell Atlantic)
served as panelists.  One purpose of the conference was to discuss the upcoming conference committee that will try to reconcile the House and Senate telco

stress the importance of competitiveness, privacy, and security, during the Q&A
session I asked the panel what they thought about the likelihood of
government-mandated key escrow, which the FBI and others are likely to push.     Only Boucher stood up to address the question, and he offered a forceful
denunciation of the entire logic of mandated escrow, citing the litany of
against it, including the observation that it was ridiculous from a
standpoint, noting that no foreign customers would ever buy such systems because
of the fear that, among others, "the CIA would be reading their mail."  He

I don't believe that's correct; under User Manager, select
the Account option under the Policies menu item; it lets you
select whether to lock-out the account after a given number
of invalid logon attempts, and to set the number.  The main
problem here is that by default, I don't believe the 'lock out'

Well, my experience is exactly the opposite: the

   Well, I'm sure you're correct on most of those,
but the post on Microsoft using ENCRYPTED databases
of competitor programs as part of its plan to surreptitiously
collect information from unsuspecting users when they allow
their "wizard" to violate their PRIVACY seems to be quite germane to this lists's topics (which include
encryption and privacy, as I recall).   I found the

@_subject: Re: noise levels and hack-Microsoft 
I don't mean to sound argumentative, but I'm wondering if you actually read the article cited earlier today by the person you were criticizing for 'noise.'  To quote from Andrew Schulman, the author of the piece he referenced, and a person who has more than a little credibility on such topics,         REGWIZ.EXE in turn loads a dynamic-link library,
        \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\PRODINV.DLL. This is the "Product         Inventory DLL," normally used for compliance checking of         upgrades to Microsoft Office programs such as WinWord.
        (In fact, PRODINV.DLL's internal module name is "COMPLINC,"         for "compliance checking.") Of course, when you buy the         upgrade edition of something like WinWord, there needs to         be a mechanism to check that in fact you really are upgrading         from some previous word processor -- be it a previous version         of WinWord, or a competitor's word processor, such as AmiPro         or WordPerfect.  So there's an encrypted database (the reasons                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        for this encryption are discussed below) inside PRODINV of about         100 products,         ...
        At this point, it was trivial to locate the beginning and end         of the buffer, and write it to disk. (Recall that the database         is stored on disk in encrypted form; this is why a search of                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        the entire hard disk did not find it.)         ...
        The database is encrypted because otherwise it would be trivial         to fool this "wizard" (hmm...; examination of RegWiz/ProdInv         shows it to be anything but wizardly) simply by creating an         appropriately-sized file with the appropriate name in the         appropriate subdirectory.
   Although I haven't personally verified the above, I'm quite
confident that Schulman is correct here.  Of perhaps greater
relevance to this list, the final passage cited above should
provide a potentially very interesting "project" for those
list-readers who are interested in the "hack Microsoft" project.
Schulman got at the cleartext by looking at the program in
a debugger, AFTER it had decrypted the database and loaded its
contents into memory; he didn't try to crack the encryption
method itself.
  My point is, if the crypto used here is as poor
as has been seen in the password area, and somebody were
to come up with a way to fool this "compliance checking"
protocol (which would defeat BOTH the "voluntary" registration
function and the potentially much more interesting reduced-
price product upgrading authentication mechanism), I think
that might constitute very poor PR for Micro$oft, as well
as a highly crypto-relevant issue.  That is, a hell of a
lot more people might exploit a flaw like that in order to falsely qualify for cheap upgrades than would ever be involved in exploiting the password cache problem.
