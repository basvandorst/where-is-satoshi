As I recall, this thread is about customs officials booting your laptop
from *their* floppy and scanning your hard drive.  I suggest two
practical solutions to avoid this incursion:
1) Leave the floppy drive at home ;-) Many PCs have swapable floppy/
CD-ROM bays. I've learned to live without my floppy (others may not have
that option.)
2) If you can't leave your floppy at home, carry your sensitive data on a PCMCIA Type-II Hard Drive. Kingston sells one sporting 500MB of capacity. Pop it out and put it as far away from the laptop as you
can. Inside your other luggage somewhere.

Didn't you over simplify this theorem somewhat. The proof that P holds
for the successor x' must be derived from the truth of predicate P for x.
The successor, x', must be shown to satisfy P because x satisfies P.
Restated: x' satisfies P if and only if x satisfies P. In this way you can start with P and the natural number 1, and show P holds for any natural number by applying your proof recursively. (i.e. P is true for 1 and my proof show it is true for 2, then my proof shows
it is true for 3, then it shows its true for 4, the it shows its true for
If the proof of P for x' is not related to the proof of P for x then
you can prove lots of irrational statements. I.e. say the Predicate P is
"is prime". Then 2 holds for P (2 "is prime"). 2's successor is 3. P also
holds for 3 (3 "is prime"). So all P holds for all natural numbers. Ergo,
all natural number are prime. I don't think so. 3's primeness must be
derived from 2's primeness. Mark P. Hahn                    Work: 212-278-5861

Sure. Simply trade offs of what's important to you and the situation you
might be in. If disguise is a primary factor, then a write once music CD would be
excellent.  If you need re-writable capability, use a CD-RW (re-writable
CD). However a CD-RW appears gold underneath, not sliver-ish, so
you have less of a disguise.
If you need fast random access, then neither version of CD will be
suitable. Hence the PCMCIA Hard Disk. However, you may have difficulty coming up with a cover story if, indeed, you do not want
to tell  a customs officer, "Oh, yeah, that's a portable disk drive".
As another trade off, most Laptops don't have CD-ROM writing drives,
so you would need an outboard drive. There are probably slick, portable
versions available, but that's more junk to lug through the airport
(and to explain, if necessary.)
Also, I was trying to suggest something practical to address the problem.
I.e. can be done in a week and under $500. Some of us could re-write the
BIOS and flash in the update in that time frame. Others of us will find
a credit card and mail order an easier route to take. (uh... minus the
lack of anonymity of buying mail order....)

If you want to condemn the whole damn system we call society, then the
"Best Drug" is to have children. See if that doesn't change your perspective
a bit.

At 09:39 PM 11/19/98 -0600, Jim Choate instructed:
I thought I was following along until I got here, and got very lost. First
question: I think the first sentence implies 4 is prime, so I must have
the emphasis wrong.
Unless you are saying that you cannot factor 4 as 2*2 because < of
something I missed >. So the only factorization of 4 is 4*1, hence four is prime. The other explanation is "Whoosh" the whole conversation when over
my head and I'm lost.
