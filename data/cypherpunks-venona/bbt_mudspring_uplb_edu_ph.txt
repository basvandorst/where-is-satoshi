Is it cheaper to install an encryption software
than an encryption hardware?
Will encryption reduce the speed of my pc?
A virus uses encryption to hide itself (correct?),
but will the files in a pc be safe from virus when encrypted? why?
(Correct me if I'm wrong) It is easier to crack (let us say) a 56 bit
technique than a 64 bit
(correct ?).

How does a hardware encryption device work?
Does it need human intervention to convert a plaintext to ciphertext
or do we still give the instructions?
Correct me if I'm wrong, the key escrow is a hardware encryption device.

@_subject: compression vs encryption 
What's the difference between compression and encryption?
Correct me if I'm wrong,  in compression we lose something, like in image compression and audio compression,  but in encryption, we don't. One sure protection againts evil hackers is encryption (?), but what if that evil hacker deletes the ciphertext file and the plain text file (that
is assuming the evil hacker just deletes every file he wants to delete).
---at least he/she didn't read/saw the file.

I found this example in a book It's about Homophonic  substitution and I can't figure how they did it , I mean how the other letters where
Here's the example
Suppose the alphabet is mapped into the numbers 1  to 99 then
map E to 17,19,23,47,64
map A to 8,20,25,49
map R to 1,29,65
map T to 16,31,85
but otherwise the ith letter maps to the 3ith letter
Then the cleartext
MANY A SLIP TWIXT THE CUP AND THE LIP
will become
  08    20        16      3185  17      25    16  47
My question is what/how did they represent the other letters like L (etc.)
coz I've tried to map them and yet I still can't understand
I even wrote A to Z then map them to 1 to 99, I still can't figure it out.
Could you also give me an example for polygram substitution.
Thank you very much.

Hey guys,
I found this in a web site.
A knapsack that holds a total....and N indivisible objects....
My quetion is does indivisible means that the object cannot be divided as
dividing a grain of rice? Does this imply I can divide an array of
integers but not the integers? If I'm going to use 0/1 knapsack algo then I'll just place a tag on each
element let us say 1 for true and 0 for false? which ever element satisfy
the condition?
What is dynamic programming approach (wavefront calculation)? Is it with
the use of pointers? or
different concept?
