@_subject: PGP in the workplace 
Here's one I figure you all would just love:
Yesterday afternoon, I was told by some higher-level associates of mine
(not Management level, mind you, just people higher on the food chain) that
my use of PGP in the coporate environment was not appreciated and could
result in my being looked upon *very* unfavorably by the managerial crowd.
Without even delving into security reasons, I politely explained to them
that due to my job (which has several crypto-related applications) I needed
PGP to communicate with people and list-bots in the outside world (or they
could gladly pay for my formal training).  The just shook their heads and
said "be careful, you've been noticed".  I was then told to stop 'messing
around' in my shell account.  I asked what was meant by this, and
apparently it had been noticed that I had done a few things, which I had
done to simply check the security of my account, which could be viewed as
'inappropriate'.  You know what they were?
1. I checked to see if the passwd file was available to anyone (was it
shadowed, etc.).  This was seen as an attempt to GET the passwd file, and
thereby have access to sensitive data.
2. I change my password regularly (once a week).  Now this may seem
excessive (it apparently did to them), but you must understand that the
entire IS department is extremely buddy-buddy here.  Over half of the users
have root passwords on any given system.  I don't feel like sharing,
horrible me.  I guess my regular chaning of passwords was seen as a strain
on the system (ha!), as they didn't elaborate *why* I had been flagged for
Upon explaining to them that I was simply trying to make sure of my own
security, I was told that I was to just assume that I was secure, and that
*any* 'poking around' was found to be "highly aggravating" and could only
only "exascerbate the situation further."
Luckily, I had to get to class, so I cut the conversation before it could
get any more out of control.
Now, seeing as I'm fairly new to the Corporate world, but is this something
common?  I know when I was at college, poking around was expected and
encouraged, as it helped find and plug holes in the system.  But this is
almost like some kind of protection racket here!

@_subject: Re: Quantum Computers 
I rather enjoyed this article, especially the part about:
This was great!  So where do we plug in the nice hot cup of tea? ;^)
I'm sorry if I seem to be making light of a very serious topic, but, last
time I checked, computers don't have a reverse.  Spam me, flame me,
whatever, but as far as I know, the universe only goes in one direction.
It's just a rehash of the old sci-fi dramas about building a computer that
goes on and builds a smarter computer, ad infinitum.  That's one of the
problems of non-sentient things: they can't grasp anything beyond their
scope.  But, for argument's sake, let's assume:
1. This quantum computer, which looks startlingly like my HP48, has a
slider labeled:
  FORWARD -- STOP -- REVERSE
   And the slider actually works.
2. We are working with a finite-state quantum computer (say 32 qbits worth).
3. There is NO error introduced into the system from any source, including
Okay, so I turn my little QC48 on, just to set a state, and then slam the
slider into REVERSE.  AT this point, it fizzles and dies.  Why?  Because of
the same reason you can't just put the DES algorithm 'in reverse': the
quantum equivalent of s/p-boxes.
What am I talking about?  I'm talking about a QUANTUM COMPUTER here.
Remember it's greatest asset?  It does every calculation at once.  This is
exactly why you can't go backwards.  You have nowhere to go, because you
have EVERYWHERE to go.  Because at each 'quantum tick' of the 'quantum
clock' EVERY possible operation is going on, each state has the possibility
of leading to every other state.
Now, let's throw out assumption  and deal with a slightly more realistic
version of my QC48, the QC48SX.
Because we're dealing with a computer that produces error in it's own
system, the error is going to be relatively hard to keep track of.  Notice
that the error-correction schemes listed don't eliminate error, they just
help thin it out.  So you've got your result to the operation you just
  OP1 + OP2 + OPERR = RESULT
The error-correction protocol makes OPERR small, but it doesn't eliminate
it.  So this is when I throw it into reverse.  (Sure, I could have kept
track of all my operations up to that point and trace back along them with
no problem, but I can only do that until the point at which I turned on my
QC48SX, so let's just assume I didn't keep track.)  I've got RESULT now,
and with a reasonable degree of accuracy, I can statistically figure out
what two states led up to that point, with a margin of error STATERR.  This
is made even tougher by the fact that there was an error (OPERR) in the
system to begin with.  Remember now, every state can lead to every other
state, but let's assume we've got NSA-level statisticians here, and STATERR
is relatively small.  You now have STATERR*OPERR working against you.  This
is where working in a finite-state machine is good, as it keeps these
values relatively small.  But they are still there.  These errors, in
combination with the quantum-s/p-box factor, precludes you from going
backwards with any degree of reliability.
Like I said, I'm not trying to tear down anyone hopes and ideas, I just
want to introduce a little *reality* into our system.

@_subject: An idle thought on CBC and block lengths 
So I was sitting bored at home and thinking to myself: CBC is cool.
Without the key, you're screwed because a single bit error propagates
throughout the entire message.  But then I was thinking, yeah, but you can
still eventually get the ONE key.  So I began to wonder what the difference
in security is between encrypting an entire M with just one K in CBC, or
encrypting M with permutations of K over specific block lengths.
On the one hand you've got just one key, which makes it that much harder to
find in the keyspace.  On the other hand, If evil interloper Eve gets her
hands it, she has to find all of the keys to get all of M.  (Assuming she
is using brute force and can't necessarily find the master K to permute
into the subkeys.)
The downsides are of course that on the one side you've got just one key,
and once you get it, you get M.  But on the other hand, you can get any one
part of the message with less difficulty because of the higher number of
keys.  And, of course, if your master K is easy to brute force, then it's
actually worse than the first option.
Does anyone have opinions / knowledge of which is better?

I was thinking about how to fix a sendmail program for our server when the
(most likely unoriginal) thought cam to me:  why not use your web broser as
a telnet tool?  You could embed CRLFs into the request field and the
receiving program would just throw the GET /[etc] out like I messed up or
something.  I could then add subsequent logins & commands to my heart's
content (or the string length of that particular browser's request field).
Being behind a firewall, I tend to think of these things. The only problem
would be with the fact that no EOL is ever sent, but with a good browser
that displays as content is streamed, you wouldn't have to worry about that.
Like I said, I doubt it's original because when I tried to do it in
Navigator I get a

I only have 3.0 on my machine, so I don't know if it works with previous
versions.  MSIE3 doesn't disable the ports, but it doesn't start displaying
anything (it suffers from the stupidity of not displaying as it streams).

@_subject: Double crypt strength 
I am curious as to the strength of Un*x crypt when used upon itself.  I was
thinking of was to obfuscate passwords and a few came to mind (obviously
not original):
1. Use a hashed passphrase.
2. Encrypt your original password and then used that as your password.  (Or
triple, quadruple, ad inifinitum...)
Re  I know that a good hash will take a pass phrase and reduce it to a
statistically random sequence.  I'm not intending to use the hash for
verfication, but for two reasons:
1. Get a nice random jumble
2. Come out with something shorter than I came in with.
Re  This I thought might help spoil a dictionary attack.  Granted, if
the attacker knows that you are doing this, it only adds one step in his
process, but if he doesn't it turns his attack into plain brute force.
Plus, for Un*x users, it's right there on the command line and only adds a
few seconds to the entire procees of changing passwords.
The added benefit with both of these is that the user does not have to
remember some cryptic string, but can remember his normal password/phrase.
By this, it is obviously not a commercial-use scheme, but one for
individual users.  (If everyone used the same algorithm, it'd be kinda
pointless, right?)  So with everyone (hashing down/reencrypting) their
(passphrases/passwords) with different algorithms, all attacks are reduced
to brute force.  Either that, or the attacker has to figure out what
algorithm the user used, still making a dictionary attack that much harder.
So what are the comments on a system like this?  Obviously, they are not
original ideas, but I would like to know what has been said about them.

I was thinking something as simple as running crypt and then the next thing
you do is run passwd.  That way, the encrypted string will probably still
be right there on the screen (assuming your passwd util doesn't clear the
screen first).  Granted, it still means that you have to remember a
pseudo-random string, but the string is always one step away if you used a
logical password/phrase to generate it.

Okay, I can accept that ...

Once again, this is non- and even counter-productive.  Pure competition is
great, but if only one company has a product, there is *no* competition.
No: many companies using the same algorithm with different implementations
is good for the economy.
It's like this: say that way back when the first electronic spreadsheet was

else can do any kind of electronic spreadsheet, because Microsoft has the

horrible for everyone else.  Lotus 1-2-3 would have never existed, etc,

CFP '97: LUNCHTIME WORKSHOP, WED. MARCH 12 1997 12:30PM -2:00PM
PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURES AND "DIGITAL SIGNATURE" LEGISLATION: 10
PUBLIC POLICY QUESTIONS
BRAD BIDDLE*
several foreign countries have enacted "digital signature" legislation
aimed at promoting the development of a public key  infrastructure
(PKI).  While PKI legislation has acquired significant momentum, it is
not clear that lawmakers have carefully considered the public policy
implications and long-term consequences of these laws.  This luncheon
session will explore certain policy questions related to a PKI, in an
informal "open discussion" format.  Ten questions we hope to address
1.	Is legislation necessary at all?	
premise that the need for a PKI is clear: public key cryptography and
verifiable certificates offer the best hope for sending secure,
authentic electronic messages over open networks, thereby facilitating
electronic commerce. They argue that the reason that the commercial
marketplace has not produced a viable certification authority (CA)
industry is because of legal uncertainty (CAs are unable to determine
their potential liability exposure because of a confusing array of
applicable background law) or because existing law imposes too much
liability on CAs.  Thus, proponents argue, legislation is necessary in
order to provide certainty in the marketplace and allow a much-needed
industry to emerge, as well as to address other issues such as the legal
status of digitally signed documents.
conclude that the market will not produce commercial CAs, and point to
the increasing numbers of commercial CAs emerging even in the absence of
legislation.  Time is solving the "uncertainty" problem, opponents
argue, and the "too much liability" problem is the product of flawed
business models, not a flawed legal system. Opponents of legislation
argue that the real danger is that a group of lawyers will impose a set
of flawed rules that will fundamentally skew a dynamic infant
marketplace and "lock in" a set of business models that the market would
otherwise reject.  The time for legislation and regulation is after
identifiable problems exist in a mature industry, opponents say, not
before an industry even exists.  Opponents of legislation further argue
that existing legal mechanisms can address the issue of the legal status
of digitally signed documents.
2.	Where should PKI legislation occur?
digital signature legislation. Some observers cringe at the thought of
50 inconsistent state digital signature laws; others believe that CAs
and consumers will opt-in to the most sensible legislative scheme, and
thus believe that competition between the states is helpful.  Proponents
of uniformity and consistency argue for PKI legislation at the federal
or international level; opponents of this view point out that general
commercial law has long been the province of state legislatures.
3.	Is licensing of Certification Authorities the right approach?
the subsequent PKI-related legislation CAs are licensed by the state. The Utah Act makes licensing optional: CAs that obtain licenses are
treated with favorable liability rules, but non-licensed CAs may exist
in Utah. Licensing is a highly intrusive form of government regulation
(other, less intrusive methods of regulation include mandatory
disclosure requirements, altering liability rules to avoid externalized
costs, bonding or insurance requirements, etc.).  Typically, licensing
as a form of regulation is reserved for circumstances where a market
flaw cannot be addressed by other, less intrusive means.   Does this
sort of dynamic exist with CAs?  Would consumers be able to make
informed, rational choices between CAs?  Could an incompetent CA cause
irreparable harm?  Could other types of regulation address any relevant
market flaws?  If unlicensed practitioners are allowed to exist, subject
to different liability rules, how will this affect the CA market?
4.	Should legislation endorse public key cryptography, or be
"technology neutral"?
specifically on digital signatures created using public key
cryptography.  Some legislation has also addressed the issue of
"electronic signatures" -- other, non-public key methods of
authenticating digital transmissions. Proponents of biometric
authentication methods argue that it is foolish to legislatively
enshrine public key cryptography as the only technology capable of
authenticating an electronic document. They argue that biometric methods
can currently accomplish many of the same goals as digital signatures;
they further argue that by precluding other technologies future
innovations will be discouraged.  They also note that public key
cryptography can only be implemented using patents owned by a limited
number of commercial entities, and question whether it is wise public
policy to legislatively tie electronic commerce so closely to the
interests of a few private sector actors.
5.	Should legislation endorse the X.509 paradigm?
infrastructure model. Subsequent laws have dropped the explicit
endorsement of X.509, but nonetheless remain true to the X.509 paradigm.
 Under most digital signature legislation, certificates serve to bind an
individual's *identity* to a particular public key.  This binding is
accomplished in the context of a rigid, hierarchical CA infrastructure. This model has been criticized for two main reasons: global CA
hierarchies are almost certainly unworkable, and identity certificates
often provide too much information -- frequently an "attribute" or
"authority" certificate will do.  Alternative certificate formats, such
as SDSI and SPKI, have emerged in response to these and other perceived
flaws with the X.509 model.  However, it is not clear that these
alternative certificate formats can be accommodated under current
digital signature legislation.
6.	How should liability and risk be allocated in a PKI?
The liability issue is most dramatic in the context of fraud.  An
impostor can obtain the private encryption key associated with a
particular party and create electronic documents purporting to be from
that party.  A second party may enter into an electronic contract
relying on these ostensibly valid documents, and a loss may occur.  Who
should bear this loss? In the paper world, generally one cannot be bound
by a fraudulent signature.  This principle may not be entirely
appropriate in an electronic context, however.  In a PKI, the integrity
of the infrastructure depends upon the security of private encryption
keys.  If a key holder bears no liability for fraudulent use of that
private key, perhaps he or she  may not have adequate incentive to keep
the private key secure.
the Utah Act and its progeny, an individual who negligently loses
control of their private key will bear unlimited liability. This risk
allocation scheme raises the specter of consumers facing immense losses

because the guy showing it off had absolutely no clue what he was talking

I said "128-bit what?" he cowered and muttered that he didn't know and went

Hmmm... the whole reason they are trying to stop the arp-spam is because
whoever is doing it is trying not to be found, right?  Well, what if
someone (or a group of someones) were to set up a web page with a script
behind it.  The page would simply ask "How many arps would you like to send
CyberPromo?".  An anonymous web user then fills in the blank, hits SUBMIT,
and the CGI does its thing.  Using this system, especially if it is not
just coming from one page but from anyone who sets up the CGI on their
system, CyberPromo really can't do anything about it, can they?
Maybe the denial of service attack is too harsh, though, and provides too
much legal ground.  What if instead of arps it sent emails to random
CyberPromo addresses?  At that point all you are doing is spamming
spammers, so what can they say?  And since it isn't you, but some passerby
on the web, you're safe from any repercussions, right?  You're just
providing the interface.
A perl script to connect directly to their SMTPd (no point in clogging
yours by using sendmail) would be trivial.  If set up on a sufficient
number of sites/pages (the form elements and script might take up a totalk
of 2k, whoopee), this could be a sort of passive agressive way of getting back.

That's your opinion, and you certainly have a right to it.  I don't want to
start the spam war all over again, suffice it to say that it's not an
opinion I happen to agree with.
Which is why I suggested the email version as well.  The arp version has
the connotation of being "morally wrong". An email version, while more
processor and bandwidth intensive, is at least no worse than what Sanford
and his crew are already doing.
Like I said, it's more of a passive agressive thing.  If I were to come
across a page that said "Click here to spam some spammers" and that's all I
had to do, why wouldn't I take 2 seconds of my time to do it?  That's
certainly less time than it takes to go through the amount of spam in my
mail each day.
And who cares if the pings/emails are coming from my site?  For the email
version I just add a header that says something to the effect of "This
email was sent to you on behalf of someone at $REMOTE_HOST" and set the
Return-Path to .  At that point, how can you prove that it
was sent by your script or just by someone using your SMTPd?

Wouldn't work with all browsers, and can't get more than one at a time.
Which is why I originally suggested bypassing the normal sendmail route and
using straight sockets.  If he blocks my script from connecting directly to
his smtpd then I use a random smtpd somewhere as a go-between, routing it
to his smtpd.  He can't (won't) block them all.  Also, this is why I
recommended making the script small and portable: *anyone* could put it up
on their site.  He can't block everyone.

him back?  I sgree with this weekend's discussion on arp attacks:
technically, they should be no different than spam attacks.  WHy then
should he (or whoever) have the right to spam me without fear of retribution?
Actually, and this is just MHO, I don't really care if the 100 or so
spams/arps I send them are but a mosquito's bite to them.  It makes *me*
feel better.  I'm not in this necessarily to shut anyone down (though it
would be a nice side-effect), just to annoy them as much as they annoy me.

@_subject: Spoofing Corporate Proxy Servers: poor man's SSL 
________________________ R i c k   O s b o r n e ________________________
My company, as well as many of yours I'm sure, uses a proxy server to give
its users access to the internet beyond its firewall.  There are strict
policies concerning what is and isn't viewable or retreivable according to
corporate guidelines.  Unfortunately, the people making these policies
aren't always as open and "fair" as they could be.  Not to mention the fact
that each and every request is logged and achived for eternity (or at least
as long as the CDs and/or tapes last).
Some of you may remember my post from ~6 months ago concerning my company's
view on the use of PGP (they didn't like it and were very frank about it).
My pursuit of crypto-related information is viewed very dimly, even while
at the same time I am told to implement certain levels of crypto in some of
the applications I develop.  The constant barrage of "why did you visit
this page?", or "what does this application you downloaded do?" is not only
irritating but counter-productive.  This got me thinking: disregarding
outside proxy schemes (such as Anonymizer), we can't really keep the proxy
server from knowing the site we are connecting to.  We can, however, hide
the page we are retrieving.
Suppose each web server had a public/private key pair, sort of like SSL.
Instead of requesting a page using the normal "GET /mypage.html HTTP/1.1"
method, the user could encrypt the URL with the server's public key (along
with appropriate headers and a random string to prevent known-plaintext
attacks) and pass that to a CGI or even a dedicated server on another port.
 The server then decrypts the request, which may or may not have included a
public key to encrypt the response, grabs the appropriate page, and sends
it back (possibly encrypted).  Other than the CGI (or the port number of
the dedicated server), the proxy server has no idea what document has been
retrieved.  Essentially we have made a remailer out of an HTTPd,
tangentally related to Adam's Eternity server, sort of like a poor-man's SSL.
For extensibility concerns, a loose protocol would have to be developed
such that different encryption schemes could be plugged in, but even a Perl
POST CGI using PGP would be trivial.  This would not only solve security
problems (varying keysizes would set the security of the data), but could
remove the corporate presence from the HTTPS market (who wants to pay
$150/key, when you can generate 2048-bit keys with PGP?).  While this does
not stop the proxy server admins from simply blocking the entire site, it
does at least offer anonymity until they figure it out.  (I successfully
used the Anonymizer for about 2 weeks before it was blocked.)

Nope, you're getting confused here.  Giving my email address is akin to the
*white* pages, while asking for spam is the *yellow* pages.  If I were to
put my phone number in the white pages of the local phone book (which I
don't), it would be so that someone who has a *need* to contact me could.
If I wanted people calling me for no reason, I'd put an ad in the yellow
pages.  See what I'm saying?
Aha!  There's the rub!  If I'm paying for my connect time, then spam *is*
Did what?  Set up a robot to flame me?  I'd hope they at least had the guts

So you're saying that if I came along and dropped a few billion pamphlets
for a campaign of mine on your house.  In addition to having to pay to get
them cleaned up, you also had to pay for the structural damage my leaflets
caused.  However, since I didn't *intentionally* cause the problems, I am
in the clear?  Give me a break.
Spam = Mail Bomb = Arp attack.  No essential difference.  Why isn't a mail
bomb or arp attack proctected by your idealized free speech?
Yes, I am a self-centered ass.  No, my feelings are not more important than
the Constitution, my feelings help *make* the Constitution, remember?  It's
moot, anyway, as I'm not advocating removing free speech.
True.  And I could be doing *more* with my time if I didn't have to spend
it setting up spam filters!
I agree.  I'm not asking for any laws, just the right to annoy spammers
just as much as they annoy me.  Why can't I do that?  If I decide to spam
them, not our of retribution, but as an exercise of my right to free
speech, then how is it any different?
You're more optimistic than I.  It must be nice to not be cynical.

I had thought about this (proxy crypto) a few weeks ago as an attack.  I
didn't give it much thought, as I'm weak on the math side, and it seemed to
me that it couldn't have been an original idea.
What really worries me is that this proxy function links alot of stuff
together: it links algorithms, it links keys, etc.  If I develop a
supposedly strong system that has a proxy function for another strong
system, then essentially if mine gets broken the other does as well.  Or,
if I recover the key for one system, I can recover the original key from
another system.  The whole situation epitomises the old "A chain is only as
strong as its weakest link" adage.  From a security point of view, this
really doesn't encourage me to include the capability for proxy functions
in any system I should happen to make.  Am I missing something here?

Oh yes, I agree.  I just don't agree that posting to usenet is asking for
spam.  I post to usenet to get valid responses to my questions (or to
respond myself), not find out what the latest get rich kwik scheme is.
Very true.  *However*, imagine this scenario: I post to Usenet regularly
using a work email address.  I am allowed by the company to do this as long
as the post is work-related.  Some spammer snatches my email address and
starts to send me email about some "Hot-n-wet" 900 number.  The filters on
the corporate mail catch this and management thinks that I'm soliciting
these ads.  I get formally reprimanded for it, which goes on my permanent
record.  The spammers have just made a major dent in my career and if it
continues to happen, I could lose my job.  It doesn't matter to Management
that I didn't solicit these emails, they just know that its getting in my

@_subject: Bypassing the trap door for LanMan 
I was thinking about LanMan passwords on NT (thanks to Hobbit and Mudge for
the background) when it occurred to me that you don't *really* have to
brute force the entire keyspace to get a password under the two systems.
Bear with me here for a sec, and please let me know if something I say is
incorrect.  I haven't read through Applied Crypto in a while and may be a
bit rusty.
What I'm thinking is this: why do you need *the* password?  Can't you just
find an MD5 collision by working the algorithm in reverse?  Obviously, when
working it in reverse you are highly unlikely to get *the* password, but if
you then shove what you got back through and it hashes out to the same
thing, what difference does it make?
We know that you can grab Win32 password hashed with minimal effort (thanks
to pwdump), and since the salt in those passwords is constant, and since
the LanMan password is just an uppercased version of the NTLM password,
could we not reverse-engineer that hash to get a working version of the
password?  It shouldn't have to be *the* password, as no challenge/response
system is in place for LanMan, and it only has to hash out to the same
thing (which is guaranteed).
Also, in a RL scenario, you'd only need the password once: to add a given
account to the Domain Admins group, or to create such an account in the
first place.  At that point, you use your dummy account and you are good to
So we have a system here:
1. Use `net view` to get a list of all nodes on the network.
2. Get the list of Domain Admins.
3. Pass that list of nodes to successive calls to pwdump to
   grab passwords from the registries, until you find one that
   a Domain Admin has logged into.
4. Reverse-engineer the Domain Admin's password and create an
   account in the Domain Admin group.
5. Use pwdump on the PDC to get the list of all usernames
   and passwords.
Now, if pwdump could be done in Perl (using Win32::Registry), then this
entire process could be automated (also using Win32::AdminMisc and a
backwards version of Cypto::MD5) trivially.  Also, since MS has yet to
truly fix the GetAdmin problem, steps 1-4 can be replaced with a single
call to that.
Using L0phtCrack (or something similar) and a nice big wordlist (say, 2
million words), I estimate that some 60%-70% of the user passwords could be
gotten in this manner, including a few of the Domain Admins' (assuming
normal, non-cypto-savvy Domain Admins), in under 2 hrs of work.
Now, as a lighter side of this, this could also be useful: Say you already
are a domain admin and are unhappy with the level of security your site is
using.  And say that whenever a user forgets their password it is reset to
something trivial (like 'password' or their employee number, etc).  A large
number of employees are not going to change that reset password (unless
User Must Change Password is set).  An Admin could therefore hash out
'password', dump the entire user/pass list, and force the ones with the
same hash to change their password at the next logon (this is in a bitfield
somewhere).  This script could be set to run once a week, insuring
non-trivial passwords.  In an environment where management refuses to
institute strong-password securities, this could be a trivial way for an
Admin to do it him/herself, without making it obvious what is going on or
without making too much work for themselves.
[Who has *just* that kind of management. :( ]
