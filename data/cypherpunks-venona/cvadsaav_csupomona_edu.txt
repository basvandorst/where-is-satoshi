@_subject: Comments on anonymous servers 
Joe Thomas has suggested that a group of penet-style anonymous servers be set up to act as "front ends" for the Cypherpunk remailers. This seems like a good idea (provided that the technical problems can be overcome), but I'd like to propose an addition.
Having more than one of the penet-style front ends active at once will only provide more targets for (anonymous) net.fascists. I suggest that instead of having a handful of front ends operating, have only one front end actually operational at a time. Other servers would be on standby, and would constantly update their database with the active server. That way, the moment someone trashed the active server, another could be activated. This way the service would be interupted only briefly.
Since it has thus far taken some time for anonymous servers to be brought down, this should allow the front ends to keep up. If someone out there trashes a new front end every month, we would only need to find a new server every month, with a "cushion" of servers waiting on standby.
Now, as I understood the suggestion from Joe Thomas, the Cypherpunk remailers behind the front ends would only be "visible" to the people involved in running the service. This would certainly make the remailers more secure, since the net.fascists would not know who to terrorize to can the remailers.
Although I certainly may be misunderstanding something, I don't really see why the users of the service would ever need to see a message about "if mail to here bounces, try there." Shouldn't the loss of a remailer be dealt with entirely "behind the scenes," by the service administrators?
If I've said something really stupid or obvious here, please bear with me. The whole idea of anonymity only became of interest to me a few days ago.

@_subject: anonymous services 
After reading Mr. Finney's response to my comments, I can see that I really shouldn't try to make suggestions on how an anonymous service should be implemented. I clearly don't have the knowledge necessary to address this subject without sounding like an idiot. :-)
So... I'll instead simply say what I would like to see in an anonymous service, and I'll leave discussion of the technicalities to people who know what they're talking about.
I'd like to see something which combines the strengths of the different types of anonymous services while reducing or eliminating the weaknesses.
A service which can be used as easily as anon.penet.fi would certainly be nice. I'd also like to see encryption available as an option. Ideally, messages would not _have_ to be encrypted. Making encryption optional would be good for paranoid individuals such as myself, while making the service more accessible to people who are willing to sacrifice security. This would also accomodate people within the U.S. who want to use the service put are afraid of Mr. Sternlight. :-)
I like the way the Cypherpunks Remailers let users chain and encrypt their messages so that even the remailers can't know both the sender and recipient. This is something I'd also like to see in a new anonymous I still think that one or more back-up servers would not be a totally bad idea. I realize that I don't know what I'm talking about, but I just don't understand why it would be impossible to have a back-up server (with a copy of the active server's database) on standby. I'm not saying that the existence of such a back-up should be advertised--I just think that it should be possible to have somebody set up a backup _without actually running it_ so that when the active server gets shut down, it can quickly step in to take over.
Oh, and on a unrelated subject...
Could anybody with information on $50/month UUNET connections please send it to me, or tell me who I should write to about it? Thanks in advance.
