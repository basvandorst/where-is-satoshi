@_subject: Nautilus 1.0 under OS/2 Warp? 
Has anyone run the Nautilus 1.0 secure telecom software in a DOS box
under OS/2?  When I've tried it, it starts up, audio saying "welcome
to Nautilus" comes out of my speakers, and I'm prompted for a
passphrase.  The problem comes when it tries to connect to the
modem. It comes back and says "Remote failed to connect" followed by
"Resetting modem...".  Then the software exits.  It never even takes
the phone line off the hook.  Other DOS comm software works just
fine in a DOS box, so why not Nautilus?

Frequently Asked Questions about Mixmaster Remailers
[FAQ Verson 1.5 Sept 22 1995]
                     by
               Lance Cottrell
This document is a semi-technical discussion of Mixmaster remailers.
I wrote this to answer questions often asked by new users of Mixmaster,
and to explain why you would want to use Mixmaster remailers.
At the end of this FAQ is a list of currently active Mixmaster remailers.
What is the most recent version of Mixmaster?
  I am pleased to announce the release of Mixmaster 2.0.2
  It contains many bug fixes. It also provides random remailer
  chaining.
What is Mixmaster?
Mixmaster is a new class of anonymous remailers. Inspired by the existing
"cypherpunk" remailers and discussions on the Cypherpunk mailing list
, Mixmaster is the next generation in the evolution
of remailer technology.
What is an anonymous remailer?
   Quoting from Andre Bacard's remailer FAQ:
        An anonymous remailer (also called an "anonymous server")
        is a free computer service that privatizes your e-mail.
        A remailer allows you to send electronic mail to a Usenet
        news group or to a person without the recipient knowing
        your name or your e-mail address.
   For a non-technical introduction to remailers (not including Mixmaster),
   I recommend Andre's FAQ. It is posted regularly to:
        alt.privacy,alt.privacy.anon-server,alt.anonymous
   or you can get it by sending mail to:
        To: abacard
        Subject: Help1
        Message: [Ignored]
What do I need to use Mixmaster remailers?
   Unlike other remailers, you can't just make your own message and send it
   to the remailer. Mixmaster's security comes in part from using a special
   message format. The disadvantage of this is that you need a special    program to make the message for you. Once you have that program    (the client) remailing is as easy as running the program, and telling it
   which remailers you want to use.
How do I get the Mixmaster client software?
   There are two sites for distribution. The first is my machine:
      or ftp to obscura.com and read /pub/remail/README.no-export
   The other is by anonymous ftp to jpunix.com
   You will have to follow the instructions there to get Mixmaster.
   Because Mixmaster contains cryptography, it may not be exported    from the U.S and Canada. The reason for the circuitous route to download
   Mixmaster is to show my good faith efforts to keep Mixmaster from being
   exported. I have heard rumors that someone has already broken this law,
   and that Mixmaster is available from Europe. I do not approve of this
   and will not support that site.
How do I get the software to run a Mixmaster remailer?
   The remailer software is available from the same sites as the client.
But I only see one Mixmaster distribution?
   The same program is used for both the client and the remailer. The only
   difference is in the installation. For the client you just compile it
   and you are ready to go. For the remailer, you need to set up mail
   forwarding and cron jobs.
What kinds of computers does Mixmaster run on?
   Unfortunately, not PCs or Macs. But it is being ported to those right now.
   Mixmaster runs under UNIX. The only machine it is known not to work on
   is Dec Alpha. It has been tested on Linux, FreeBSD, SunOS 4.1.3,
   Solaris, and several others. It has been compiled and tested on Netcom.    If you use it on a machine or service not on this list, please let me    know so I can add it.
How does Mixmaster work, and why should I use it?
   You should use Mixmaster if you want the highest level of anonymity
   available, or if your are tired of building remailer messages your self.
   A discussion of how Mixmaster provides this level of security is beyond
   the scope of this FAQ, but I put an essay on the subject on my home page
Does Mixmaster use PGP?
   No, Mixmaster uses the rsaref package from RSA. Mixmaster uses its own
   keys and key file formats. To add a key to a key ring, simply append    the key to your key file using your favorite text editor.
When Was Mixmaster Released?
   Mixmaster was originally released on an experimental basis in late
   1994. There were only ever two remailers running Mixmaster 1.0.
   Mixmaster 2.0 was released on May 3, 1995. There are now 18 publicly
   available Mixmaster remailers.
What is the latest version of Mixmaster?
   Version 2.0.2 was released on Sept 22, 1995. Mixmaster remailers can
   now accept messages containing multiple Mixmaster packets. Mixmaster
   can be told to choose a random set of remailers to chain your message
   through. It will now route multiple packet messages over independant
   chains. Several minor bugs were fixed.
   Version 2.0.1 was released on May 27, 1995. The only changes from 2.0
   are some improvements in the documentation, and the inclusion of a    more up to date list of remailers.
What remailers run Mixmaster?
   The most recent list of remailers is available on my homepage, along
   with the remailer list and key file for Mixmaster. You can simply
   replace your old files with the ones from my site to keep up to date.
   These files are in ftp://obscura.com/pub/no-export/
   They are also available by ftp.
   Here is the current list of Mixmaster remailers. Send mail to the
   remailer with the subject remailer-key to retrieve the remailers

To All,
    A theme I have been thinking about lately is a virtual
data haven using a m from n secret splitting scheme via
a DC Net for access and hosting the entire process via HTML
and W3. The salient feature would be database objects split in such a way that participating
sites would possess no more than 1 encrypted slice of any particular
encrypted object. Some redundancy of storage is built into the design and
participating site give up local storage to store other slices
of the datahaven. At no time is the site hosting able to
make correlations of slices to plaintext traffic because the
split is done on the users workstation and the placement of the slice
on the individual slice on the member datahaven site is accomplished with
encrypted remailer tech(probably Mixmaster 2) and CGI or java
scripts. The idea here is to be able to store ANY information on the net
not just what the local bluenoses approve of.

@_subject: WSJ: IBM Corp. Compromises On Encryption Keys (fwd) 
You might want to disregard the paranoid, irrelevant head and tail, but
the included article is very good, especially considering the establishment
source. Nice headline, for the WSJ.
Forwarded message:
I haven't seen this, but because of all the math stuff on my web, I'm getting both phone calls and a lot of odd math feed back. We think we do have a real carry bit error between the Win 3.x and Win95. Some of the data I've reviewed is pretty scarry. Microsoft lost a lot of their older programmers over the past 3 years. It was literally an Exodis out. Now they have a lot of people that can't read the old code and this is a real mess. They also can't get anyone with much experience to work there. Here in Redmond good people just stay away. I saw this article today in Dow Jones and thought it might shed some light on the security issues.  I know what MS's 10 year strategy was
from 1990. Steve Ballmer is  the one making all the decisions on international markets. It's his baby. When I read this about IBM and Lotus all I could think of was Steve ordering the guys to make something exceptable for their license by the FED so they could gain market share over their competitors. This is just who he is. He doesn't understand the techincal issues and hasn't listened to Gates in years. MS is pretty thick with DC and must pay off lots of people there. That is what they were doing when I worked for their government group. It's weird working with the FED. They are all into their power groups. AND they are very low tech. I swear the FED is scrapping the bottom of the technical pool. The FBI is the worse. -------------- Gates is the kind of person who will do just what they want if he gets
dicked with. He'll have a ranting fit (Gates is a functional autist) about
how stupid it is and then he will just get eccentric and say, give them
what they want with a grin. He is still a hacker at the core. You
understand the problem here. The FED is making them use lower security and
then patting them on the back and buying their products for our own
government and militery.  Gates use to brag that he would crash the fed. I
really believe he is still trying. NO ONE hates the FED more than GATES!
He was a page in DC at 17 and got a good taste of our government. I've had
it with these people too. DC is so discusting. All these attorneys who
don't know shit about anything but words and lying... Hey, I updated my web... : ) To day I filed an appearance in court and
fired my attorney. I'm still being dicked with here. If I don't look both way when I cross the street, I get busted. This week it was an unwanted touch. I touched someone's shopping bag getting into my car. Next week its an non-contact order by my daughter's guidence counselor. She considers a phone call from me about my daughter's possible college programs a threat! When I got the complaint it was totally nuts. Everything she knows about me is based on gossip. It reads like total hysteria. The way Microsoft has attempted to play me locally is really  amazing. I was 40 when this started. Never had a problem before that. So when I say, 'Watch your back!' I mean it. : )
