hmm... Besides the initial cost of a CD writer (which is coming down alot),
blank CDs cost $8AU (or about $5US).  I would not call that expensive relative
to the game cost (about $90AU).  On a double speed drive it takes about 30
minutes to duplicate a 600meg game, lots less for those that don't fill the
CD :-).
I think this is starting to become a real problem.
Having visited some friends recently that had most of the recent interesting
games written onto a few CDs (multiple games on single CDs) I don't agree.

If you have SSLeay 0.8.1, run
ssleay s_server -port xxxx -www
and when you connect to the port, it will return a page like

:-) I always find this amusing myself.  If people have written code, they are,
by virtue of the fact they have actually done the work, able to enforce their
particular views on the world via their licence, be it a GNU, BSD, Netscape or
other form.  The problem sometimes occurs when people put their code out under
a licence they do not fully understand, and does not capture their intent.
I personally have a policy that if I ever change the licence conditions in any
of my code, the last version with the old licence will always be available for
those who don't like the new licence.  This way if my opinions on how the
software can be used changes, people don't have to suffer through my
'conversion to a new faith' :-).  The will only have access to the old stuff
under the licence they like.
And the problem that some of us have with the GPL, in that it does take a
rather strong stance on this issue, making it incompatable with other people
who are not that passionate.
