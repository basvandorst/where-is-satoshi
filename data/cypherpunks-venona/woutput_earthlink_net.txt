This is correct. A class called the SecurityManager enforces this,
and it can be changed or shut off if one builds a custom version of the
classes zip file that has the appropriate changes to the security manager.
There was a posting to a java news group or mailing list about how to do
this a few months ago, I can find it if anyone cares.
