@_subject: Announcing Bellcore's Trusted Software Integrity (Betsi) System 
A N N O U N C I N G ! ! ! ! !
           Bellcore's Trusted Software Integrity (Betsi) System.
Betsi addresses a security concern of software distribution in the Internet.
Currently, there is no way to know that software obtained by anonymous ftp
has not been modified since it was posted. Also, malicious software can be
posted without the offender leaving a trace. Betsi is an experimental prototype that is meant to provide some degree of assurance about the integrity
of software and the identity of its author. The current version of Betsi is an experiment. The long-term goals are:
   -  help software venders distribute programs and patches    -  provide accountability by linking the author of a program
      to a real person whose identity is verified off-line    -  allow users to run software obtained on the Internet with
      less danger of viruses and trojan horses    -  use cryptographically strong techniques to preserve file
      integrity
   -  scale well in the Internet community
   -  minimize effort on the part of the users
   -  use existing infrastructure and standards
Betsi is a free, experimental service. It requires use of pgp to
verify signatures from Betsi. Betsi's public key is widely available.
It can be obtained from numerous public key servers by requesting
the key for certify or Betsi. It also appears in a paper that
was submitted for publication, in the help file (described in a moment)
and at the end of this message.
For additional information on Betsi send mail to
certify with subject, help. A copy of the paper describing Betsi can be obtained by anonymous
ftp from thumper.bellcore.com in the directory /pub/certify.
A copy of the public key for Betsi can also be found there.
It is recommended that the key be obtained from at least two
different places and compared.
Betsi's public key:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

Well, in many cases, people will be checking the key in several
different places for extra assurance that it is correct. Including
the fingerprint just saves them a calculation. I suppose you have
a point that the fingerprints could all match, and be unrelated
to the key being posted, but then I'd only be cheating myself.

@_subject: Upgrade to Betsi 
Update on Bellcore's Trusted Software Integrity System
The format of Betsi certificates has now been upgraded
to accomodate multiple files. The md5sum program, which
is included in the contrib directory of the pgp 2.6.1 distribution, takes a list of files or wildcards as
arguments and produces a list of md5 hash sums followed
by file names. The format of a request for certificate
message is the same as before for one file, and as
follows for multiple files:
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The paper at thumper.bellcore.com in /pub/certify/Betsi.ps has been
updated to reflect this upgrade, and it is further explained there.
I am currently working on writing mosaic pages to facilitate the
process of sending various messages to Betsi.
For more information on Betsi send a message to certify with the subject: help.

@_subject: Follow-up to sci.crypt posting that prompted NYT article 
Yesterday, a New York Times article cited a posting by several
graduate students at Berkeley about the insecurity of the Internet.
We found the sci.crypt posting very interesting and relevant because we spent a good portion of the summer working to address the same problem.
Namely, detection of the malicious (or other) modification of an executable in transit over an untrusted network. In particular,
we believe that our system could be used to solve the NFS problem
mentioned in the posting from Berkeley.

@_subject: Experience teaching cryptography and computer security at NYU 
Last semester, I taught a graduate course called "Cryptography and
Computer Security" at NYU. I have written up a summary of the experience. You can find it at
ftp:    thumper.bellcore.com  in /pub/rubin/fall95.ps or fall95.ps.Z
web:    ftp://thumper.bellcore.com/pub/rubin/fall95.ps.Z
and there is a link to it from my home page:
        ftp://thumper.bellcore.com/pub/rubin/rubin.html
I will be teaching the same class next semester at NYU, and there are
plans for a sequel next fall.
