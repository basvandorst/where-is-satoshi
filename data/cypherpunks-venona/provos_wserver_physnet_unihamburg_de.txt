AFAIK is 24 km the longest connection ever realised so far.  The group of
N. Gisin at the Univsersity of Geneva tested a quantum channel below the
Geneva lake with a length of 24 km. To be found at:
A. Mueller, H. Zbinden and N. Gisin, Nature 378, 449(1995)
A Bibliography of Quantum Cryptography can be found at
I think there is something on Quantum Cryptography from Los Alamos
National Laboratory on Crypto'96 in August. They managed 7.5 km so far ?  Niels Provos =8)

@_subject: http relay script 
I am sure this was discussed already.
Is there meanwhile a http relay cgi script out there which could be
packaged with the common http daemons (like cern, apache or ncsa) ?
The use of that is obvious: every new web server could be used as
anonymizer and thus proxies would have a hard time to filter all those
sites in censorship countries.
