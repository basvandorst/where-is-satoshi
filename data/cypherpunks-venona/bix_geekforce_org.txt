Ok, if there's been a URL posted explaining what the law says about
registration, I missed it.

Yeah yeah all very well and good parody except that the 2nd amendment
contains the word "well-regulated" and the 1st doesn't. (And yes I know I'm asking for a shitstorm of trouble saying that on THIS
list of all places).

And notice also that the 1st begins with "Congress shall make no law" while
the 2nd begins with "a well regulated militia".
Becos the attempted paraody was lame in the same ways that all attempts to
nonrationally support 2nd amendment freedoms by calling down the gods of 1st
amendment freeomds always are nonrational. (And no, that's not me saying
supporting 2nd amendment freedoms is irrational; it's me saying using the
1st amendment to do so is irrational).

Same comments as before. Utiizing the text of the 1st to defend one's
approach to the 2nd is nonrational, which is what the lame parody attempted
to do, and what I was criticizing.

Which would in no way affect the fact that it's asinine to try and use the
First Amendment to make a point about the Second Amendment (as the parody
does) because they are approached in entirely different ways to address
entirely different things.
Which was my central point.
