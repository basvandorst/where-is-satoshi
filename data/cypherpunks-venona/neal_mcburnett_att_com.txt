@_subject: Analysis of PGP keyserver web of trust 
I wrote a Java program to analyze the the PGP web of trust and I've
documented it on some web pages.  They include information on the
strongly connected components (the largest has 1291 keys in it), the
longest "shortest-path" (21 signatures long), the 'central trustee'
and 'central truster', the mean path length (6.4, by one definition), etc.
(For those who saw the earlier version, I've fixed some small bugs.)
There is a lot of useful information here for folks who want to
improve the connectivity of the public PGP web of trust.
