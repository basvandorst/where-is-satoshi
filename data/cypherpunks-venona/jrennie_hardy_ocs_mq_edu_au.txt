@_subject: A site idea 
Hello all,
Well after joining this list a few days ago, i've decided to take the plunge and post something. I was looking for feedback on an idea for a site. I hope this dosen't violate any rules for posting and i appologise if it does. Please dont flame me for my ignorance if i've broken any unspecified rules for posting.
Anyway on to my idea. I'm a Christian (NO not some religious right looney from the states). My idea was to setup a site dedicated to secure and anonymous transmiion of data. The appilication being for Christian missionaries in dangerous countries, but also as a general purpose site for crypto and anoniminty. I was hoping to collect information on setting up anon remailers of various types and compiling links and articles for the site. Can anybody point me in the right direction ? Again i hope i haven't offended anyone or broken any posting rules to this forum.

Thats fine but, i dont want to be invited to look at nasty naked cheerleaders. And isn't it somewhat problematic when a 15 yr old looks at the mail box ?? BEsides i hate junk mail too, and if i could stick a no junk mail sticker on my email i would.
Can this be done ?? Any ideas anybody ??

@_subject: Re: spam on this list 
I thik i've badly explained myself.
The reason i HATE spam is for the same reason i hate telemarketing. I resent these  using MY mail box as an advertising medium. If i look at there page, and it has advertising thats fine, because i went there. If i'm on a list that has advertsing on it, then it is my choive and i can get off the list. Having it sent to MY email box is NOT my choice and my rights to choose are being infringed by these idiot shoveling there crap into my email box. Do you like telemarketers calling you ?? Is that free speech or invasion of privacy. There is a solution to tele marketing. It is to tell thm it will cost the $500 to use your phone for advertising purposes. It has been done, taken to court and won. In fact the judge had his football inturpted by the telemarketers and they has to pay. This guy has never been called again. WOuld this work with SPAM ?? I dont want it and they dont have permisiion to advertise in something that is mine. IF that is a violation of free speech can i come over to your place and put up some pro neo-nazi stuff on your property without your permission. I'm just harmlessly advertising on yuor personal property.
I agree this is an extreme example but i think it makes the point. I'm not anti-free speech, i'm just anti unwanted mail.
Unfortuently i cant just tell them it will set them back cash to advertise in my mail box because i'm in australia and the legal headaches wouldn't make it worth it. Doe snaybody in the US want to take it up and kill spam once and for all ?? You only need the legal precedent set.
I expect to get flamed and crapped all over for this but i dont care. I resent being suggested i'm some sort of ultra right conservative. Well i guess thats who those guys are i was told i was wanting to be like.

@_subject: The spam thread 
looks like i started a raging debate. Sorry if this debate bores anybody but as was said to me, just delete it.
I notice nobody commented on the i just dont want advertising in my mailbox point, and why shouldn't they be billed. What i suggested WASN'T a new law that could be abused etc. It was a very minor legal precedent, where the owner of a phone or email box could be paid for advertising in in IF the marketer was informed. To Ross, SPAM may be freedom of expression as my child pornography, but 2 1. What about my rights to privacy, and my rights to my mailbox that I pay for. Why should it be used as an advertising medium if i font want it to be used for one ??
2. By your argument, mailbombing of all flavours is free expression and should be allowed. Seeing as this follows logically RU going to get upset if i mail bomb you ??
All this started when i asked if SPAM might be coming through this list, i didn't think it would have tyhis effect, but discussion is healthy.
Anyway shall we let this thread die at this point ??

So, write a new browser (Theres a linux project staring to do this for linux soon/now (i think anyway)) and then port to a bunch of systems and base it outside the US. There aren't any import restriction on strong crypto yet are there ?? Besides you could then set up a home page ala. netscape.com and rake in the advertising dollars, if you can get teh browser to take off. A lot of if's and work but in theory it Jason =8-]

@_subject: Old Cryto stuff, 
Can anybody suggest any good books on old cryto techniques ?? I'm finally learning to program, along with the stuff i've got to learn as part of the class i thought i would make a start on learning to code crypotgraphic algorithms. I was after some old ones that are simple to code in software. Unfortuently the one in the back of the Schnier book are a little to complex for my limited programming knowledge so far. So can anybody help or will i just be ignored like i have been at other times ? Jason =8-]

Well i was a amused and i'm a Christian. Pity the $%& in the Christian right in America give real Christians such a bad name. Unlike truthmonger seems to think not all Christians are goosesteping fascists who like to bugger little kids for fun and profit. Sadly i guess as long as the fascists claim to be Christians, and try to get everybody to confrom to thier beliefs this sort of post will be in some ways accurate.

@_subject: Re: The BIG Lie (Jesus Confesses) 
I'm inclined to agree with the RC's not being The same as prodestants comment. Why else would you have had Luther and the other reformers if some of catholicism wasn't a problem ??
Is it worth noting at this point that an evangilical Christian and the religious right have little in common. Evangelicals (I'm one) belive the Bible to be the word of God etc.. but don't add anythign else to it and certianly wouldn't force thier beliefs down your throat. They would I would also have a problem with Christians controlling and censoring the net. I would welcome (and do welcome) sites that which to argue against Christianity. What wrong with that ?? It simply provides a forum for Christians to defend thier beliefs. Besides if I censor you now because i find your content un acceptable whats to stop you censoring me later when your in the majority ! What utter stupidity to load the gun for others. Particularly as i am a Christian I WOULD be critical of some of the religious rights ideas and agendas and would happily argue from the Bible that they are not a good thing.
I thought school pray was outlawed in the states ?? Would they be willing to accpet my view on thiers ?? If yes then i'll accept thiers on mine
Such as ?? As has been said before you can get censorware to control thier access.
I must agree with that point
Christians whould read challenging stuff. IT expands thier mind and strengthens thier beliefs (Well i find it does), and in my expirence a Christian who cant defend thier faith needs to learn more. Although i would disagree with dismissing creationism and Biblical inerrancey. (not that is is an appropriate forum for such a discussion)
Well intersting post. I hope the response is of some use.

I notice to many and all for you have a way of being the same. Typical narrow minded sterotyping. SO get out more and meet more Christians. Dont generalise to some tiny subset you know.                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^
Next you'll claim to belive in evoloution because it has hard facts. Sorry to burst your bubble but evolotuion is at least as faulty as creationsim. And before you shoot your mouth off and look stupid, i have studied a lot of biological scinces at a teritiry level, and was majoring in it till i swithced to computer science. I also know heaps of biology students who share a similar opinionof evolotuion. No not all of these are Christians they just know what there talking about.
Again, your probably an evolotuoinist. You belive in quarks don't you ?? But wait you cant see them and all information realted to them is theoretical. Still what can i expect from the sheltered ignorant. Get out more and meet more poeple and dont generalise to all from small subsets you ignorant individual.
