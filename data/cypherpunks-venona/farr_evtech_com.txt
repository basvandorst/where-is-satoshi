@_subject: crypto email to France 
Hello -
My company would like to be able to send encrypted mail to our office
in Paris.  Strictly inter-company stuff, using PGP for example.  I know
we can buy PGP here, and get it off the net in Europe, thereby avoiding
exporting the technology in either direction...  I've been told by someone
here in the US that France wants control of any use of encryption software
including sending email.  I've also been told by someone in France that the agency in France is the Service Central de la Securite des Systemes d'Information (SCSSI), and that they want companies to register with them
for use of cryptographic software.  I've read what I can find on the
net about legalities of using encryption software, and everything concerning
Europe (what little there is) is quite vague.  Does anyone here know any details or where I might find out more about
what, if anything, needs to be done to legally exchange encrypted email
with our office in Paris?
Thanks very much!

Thank you, Pierre, and everyone else who has responded both privately
and through the cypherpunks mailing list.  I will post a summary of
the procedure and any other relevant information when I (finally!)
find out what that is.  Thanks also for the translation of the french law you posted.  Someone from
France had sent me the original, and while I can read it, this will
save me some work writing up a translation for our lawyer.
Best wishes to all,
Rebecca Farr
