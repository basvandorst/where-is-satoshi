@_subject: Legality of *non*-encryption 
I heard an interesting new slant on the legality of encryption today.
I was talking to a colleague who is employed in a law firm here in Germany. It appears that under the current interpretation of German law, communications of a confidential nature (for example, contracts, medical records and so forth) over an insecure network *MUST* be encrypted to protect the Client. It is therefore a breach of German law to send unencypted eMail, unless it can be proved that every stage of the transmission happens over internal (secure?) paths.
I will dig further on this - perhaps there is a useful precedent to be established here. At very least we might be able to keep lawers (and doctors) off the net ;-)

@_subject: Re: Archives? What archives? (fwd) 
Here's the deal...
if someone gets a copy of the archives to me somehow, I pledge that I will get them  burned and will distribute them for cost price. I assume there will be two CDs as the data is apparently around 1GB. I have already checked, and for a run of 300 (should be enough to cover all the non-apathetic CP list members) the costs are:
     DM1,67 = 92 cents each
     = $1,84 + VAT = $2,15.
Add postage onto this.
A really great idea would be to include the coderpunks archive on any space that were left over. But first of all, I'll keep the focus as the greatest enemy of 'good' is Note: IMPORTANT: The rep was emphatic - you shouldn't forget that this price includes *2 color* labelling! Makes the offer kind of irresistable doesn't it?
Why am I doing this? Because just as Tim pointed out, this has been discussed more than once but there have been no results. At least none that I have heard of in the last One point - I am outside of the US. Good for europeans, but perhaps a little expensive for US-CPs. Maybe someone would like to take over the US distribution. (WHGIII?) I could get 50% to the states for distribution.
Anyone wants to arrange this with me, contact me off-list. If no one does, then I'll start bugging people until something happens ... , on 09/04/98 was the dude

@_subject: Archives! Polite reminder! 
In my previous mail of a couple of weeks ago I offered to produce a CD of the CP archives. So far there have been no offers of data for this exploit.
This is a polite reminder that if someone can offer a copy of the archives in an easily transportable format, I will take care of the creation and distribution of the CD.
Come on Cypherpunks - don't let your apathy get the better of you.
