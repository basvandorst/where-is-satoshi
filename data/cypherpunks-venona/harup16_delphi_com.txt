Steve Levy of Wired Magazine told me I could get Pretty Good Pri
from your group.  His instructions weren't too clear, but he said to mail to this address.  Please mail me with info.  Thanks.

The day that I feel the need to have to pay $100 to ensure that my business
is nobody's business but my own is the day I leave this country for a nice
outlet free desert island. I know that it was wrong to steal the RSA code for
a shareware alternative, but you gotta understand the stakes here:  Breaking
a patend, or keeping the government from snooping on each and everyone of us.
Sure, RSA is great, and they should get payed for their time programming, yap, yap, yap.  But when Salk found a vacine for Polio, did he have a little fit and
say "no!  you are all going to die because I am a greedy little bastard", no,
he made the vacine a sort of share-ware.  I know there is a great deal of difference between death and software, but just tell that to to the people involved with Inslaw(hope you are all familiar with Promis software).
