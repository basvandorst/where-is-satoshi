I apologize for the delay in responding to your message -- I will be
putting a lot of information about NoCeM up on  in
the next day or so.  You can also find information in the newsgroup
alt.nocem.misc (if you get it).
If these don't work for you, feel free to write to me, and I'd be
happy to send you whatever you need.
