@_subject: RIPEM message for your approval 
============================== START ==============================
As you can imagine, many changes have been proposed, and, I think,
some good ones incorporated, in the most current form of the RSAREF
license. These changes are based on constructive comments from over
twenty people. These changes may encourage folks to distribute RSAREF
and RIPEM who otherwise would not have.
We plan to make all RSAREF applications (such as RIPEM) availble WITH
RSAREF.  Why shouldn't someone get all the stuff built on it if they
get RSAREF? (Including helpful code such as the Thompson/Schiller
emacs adapter.) I assume you have no objection.
I'm hopeful that you see these changes as positive; please let me know
if that's not true! I offer a summary of them, the rationale,
perceived benefits, and a complete copy of the revised license.
Here's a summary of the changes between what's attached (the one we
plan to now "standardize" on for RSAREF) and what you sent me:
changed 1(a) and added (8): the license is now perpetual. Some have
claimed RSA might "suddenly" decide to cancel RSAREF licenses. It is
now crystal clear that the license can only be cancelled by violating
the agreement. RSA cannot cancel it at its discretion. And even if you
violate it, it doesn't cancel the license of those who got it from
you. I think this is an importnat clarification, from what I've heard.
changed 1(c) and added 2(d): We don't care about any porting or
performance mods, but we don't feel we should allow automatic access
under the normal interface. We've granted it to you since RIPEM
predates RSAREF (also to John Gilmore for a secure RLOGIN using
Diffie-Hellman) and we'll grant it to anyone for any reasonable use.
(We state so in the Agreement.)  We just want to know what it is we're
allowing to go around the interface.
End of Section 1 - a clarification in the form of an addition is made
here. Some have said that unrelated software on a tape with RSAREF
could be covered by the restrictions imposed on RSAREF Application
Programs. This should clear that up. (I believe this helps you in the
separate distribution of the RIPEM code minus the RSAREF code.)
changed (6): We simply have removed RSA's $5,000 cap on protecting
RSAREF users against charges from some other patent holders. (Like
PKP!) Some have claimed that RSAREF was posibly a way to "set up"
users for PKP (the patent holders) since $5K was hardly enough to
defend against patent infringement.  (They actually thought RSAREF was
a way to get people to infringe just so that PKP could sue them! RSA
pays $5,000, but PKP collects more, therefore it's a 'you hold em, and
I'll hit em' thing, or so I guess they thought.) I believe this makes
it clear we intend to sue no one for using RSAREF, and in fact defend
users ALL THE WAY if someone else does.
I think these are all for the better, and will engender trust in RSA's
intentions with RSAREF, to support free PEM.

@_subject: pgp 
I don't think you're aware of our position on pgp. Unfortunately, you
may leave us no choice but to take legal action, which we will unless
you cease promotion adn distribution of pgp. The next message will
state our position.

@_subject: "RSA sells out" hue and cry 
Re "source" requirements for Clipper: See my last email to you. ATT,
Motorola, etc. are licensed to use RSA and Diffie-Hellman.  They are free to use those techniques to manage Clipper keys, as long as they
pay their royalties for those techniques, without any contact with us.
Or perhaps, when we lciensed them back in the mid and late 80's, we
should have limited the use of public key to key management of "future
algorithms we approve of?" ********************** END FORWARD ***********************************
Draw your own conclusions.  I sure will.

@_subject: NSA Agents Threaten to Kill Bidzos of RSA? 
Everything reported in the Merc News is true. I am certain that he was
not speaking for the agency, but when it happened he was quite
serious, at least appeared to be.  There was a long silence after he
made the threat, with a staring contest.  He was quite intense.
I respect and trust the other two who were in the room (they were
shocked and literally speechless, staring into their laps) and plan to
ask NSA for a written apology and confirmation that he was not
speaking for the agency. We'll see if I get it.  If the incident made
it into their trip reports, I have a chance of getting a letter.

@_subject: Thank you Bob Anderson (fwd) 
FYI... I'd appreciate if you posted this wherever you saw RC4...
    It has come to RSA Data Security's attention that certain RSA
trade secrets, in the form of confidential and proprietary source
code, have been misappropriated and disclosed.  Please be advised that
these acts, as well as any retransmission or use of this
misappropriated source code is a violation of the Uniform Trade
Secrets Act and various other state and federal laws.  Any person or
entity that acquires, discloses or uses this information is subject to
criminal and civil penalties including an injunction, compensatory
damages, punitive damages and payment of RSA's attorneys fees.
    RSA considers this misappropriation to be most serious.  Not only
is this act a violation of law, but its publication is a gross abuse
of the Internet.  RSA has begun an investigation and will proceed with
legal action against anyone found to have violated its intellectual
property rights.

@_subject: Bidzos on CNBC, discussing Leahy's Bill 
I'm in favor of the Bill because it specifically prevents, by law, the
US Govt from mandating key escrow. Also because it would, by law,
force export control of crypto out of the Dept. of State and into the
Dept.  of Commerce, effectively allowing any crypto used in the US and
"widely available" to be exported. (The bill does a few other things.
One, it provides for criminal penalties for key holders who abuse
their role as an escrow agent, assuming anyone *chose* to use key
escrow.  Second, it makes the use of encryption -any encryption- a
crime if used in the commission of or support of any criminal
activity. I think the bill would be better off without these
provisions, but I suspect this is an attempt to give the
administration something.)
I anticipate that the Administration, led by the intelligence and law
enforcement interests, will vigorously lobby against this bill...
