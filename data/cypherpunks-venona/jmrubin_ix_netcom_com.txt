In article <44leli$s38 VMARX There was a posting allegedly from a Harvey S. Cohen at AT&T on soc.culture.jewish to the effect that the "Long March" email is, in fact, a fraud intended to get the National Alliance in trouble. (a noble cause if not necessarily appropriate means)
I don't know if this is connected but I notice that a "let's use these big lie tactics on Usenet" posting allegedly from the National Alliance's Compuserve address seems to have somehow gone through the University of Pennsylvania.
