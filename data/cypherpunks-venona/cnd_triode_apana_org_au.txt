@_subject: Intro from a list reader 
My name is Christopher Drake, I own the company NetSafe.  We
        manufacture and sell one product - NetSafe - which prevents one
        small but universally unadressed, serious problem in computer
        security:  We prevent passwords (etc) from being stolen with
        Key Press Password recorders (KPPRs).
        My interest in this list is to stay up-to-date with the industry.
        You may recently have heard of the First Virtual announcement re:
        credit card number theft via automated means: our software specifically
        prevents this.
        Full details can be found at            Interested parties from the recent cypherpunks meeting might
        like to note my public key: after the discussion I finally did it :-)
