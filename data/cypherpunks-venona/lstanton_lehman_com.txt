In practice, it can be hard to use this system for more than embarrassment,
since it works by identifying the car, not the driver. Fortunately, we have
not quite reached the point yet where my license gets the points if I loan
you my car, and you speed.
Soon though...

This sounded to me like a convenient excuse. I think what really
happened is that our fearless ex-NSA-leader found that he didn't like
people invading HIS privacy.
Maybe we should send someone to recruit him?

Two points:
1) A single bank would not have enough capital to significantly affect
world interest and inflation rates, even if all of its depositors acted
in concert to do so.
2) If you ignore that and assume that a new banking system grew outside
of government control with enough capital to affect the world markets,
why is that A Bad Thing?  Do you really think that a large non-us-government
regulated bank would bring the world financial system to its knees?

I think that these proposals would still be coming from the government
if Bush had been re-elected, but that they would generate more opposition,
which would, to me, be a Good Thing.
It is an unfortunate fact that in this country, people often react
differently to an idea, depending on who produces it. I have spoken
to people who really TRUST Clinton, and who have no objection to clipper
and the wiretap bill, until you remind them the the Republicans could
be in office again someday. Then they go "Oh, yeah. That would be a
There is also the partisan issue. It would be much easier to muster
opposition in Congress if the majority party was not the same as the
party of the administration.

This is how I see it (all numbers made up for illustration):
If Clipper/Digital Telephony are proposed by Clinton, 60% of Democrats
and 70% of Republicans will support.
If Clipper/Digital Telephony are proposed by a Republican, 40% of Democrats
and 80% of Republicans will support.

I am glad to see that the 'web of trust' model is spreading. However,
I still see no reason to use ripem.
1) ripem is illegal for non-north-american users
2) ripem still uses DES
3) using ripem supports the notion that PKP holds some valid patents

@_subject: New ID technique: warning of things to come 
This is a little off-topic, but it does apply to authentication...
I have been abroad for the past few weeks. In the course of my travels, I
was given some data about a new program that the US Dept. of State/Customs
and Immigration people are moving into limited testing at JFK and LAX.
They want to implement a "fast, positive identification system to speed
processing of entrants to the United States by use of biometric data."
The system works by use of a handprint scanner, and a smart card.
Participants would go through an initial hand scan, and then be issued
a smartcard. Upon subsequent entries to the US, instead of going through
the normal passport check, you would place your hand on a scanner and insert
your card in the slot. The system would then positively identify you, and
clear you for entry.
I have no details about the format/security of the card data, and the INS
guy I spoke to made no statements about privacy, security or other uses
of their ID database.
If this takes off, the risks of it spreading to a national ID card, or to
the 'healthcare card' are obvious.
