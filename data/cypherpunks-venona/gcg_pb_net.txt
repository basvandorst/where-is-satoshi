The key doesn't need to be found in real time!  You can always record the
call and decrypt it later.  If the information deals with an event in the
future, you could have plenty of time to crack it.

Greetings all,
  Does anyone know if the 1.4a version works correctly with Win95?  If not,
is there an updated version?  If not, will there be one anytime soon?  If
not, will PGPLIB (aka PGP3.0) provide a similar function?  If not... heck!

I assume that when you say that "it does", this means that I can access the
encrypted drive from Win95.  If so, can you tell me how.  I have a 50mb
partition that's encrypted and if I boot to DOS everything works perfectly,
but from Win95, the drive is always encrypted.  I've tried entering my
passphrase prior to Win95 loading... no effect.  If I try to enter my pp
from a DOS box, it says that the SECTSR isn't loaded, but MEM says that it
is.  Any thoughts?

@_subject: Re: Secure drive under Win95... a better way. 
After much fiddling, I've found (IMHO) a "good" way of using secure drive
1.4a under Win95.  After doing the partitioning and encrypting, put the
following in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file...
login D: /S
 /T:N,1
 errorlevel 2 goto ContinueLoad
login D:
 errorlevel 1 goto Again
 errorlevel 0 goto ContinueLoad
 Try again?
 errorlevel 2 goto ContinueLoad
 EnterPP
abviously you have to replace the D: with your drive letter, and the
directory at the top with your SECDR14a dir.  Then, in Win95 you have to
turn off 32 bit disk access.  To do this without losing all the speed of
virtual memory, do the following...
  right-click on My Computer
  click on Properties, Performance, File System, Troubleshooting
  and check the box labeled: Disable all 32 bit protect-mode disk drivers.
  Re-boot.
If you have a CD-ROM drive, you will have to load the DOS drivers in order
to be able to access it.
Granted, this is just a kludge until Secure Drive is re-designed for Win95,
but I've tried a dozen different combinations, and this gives you all the
SecDrv security under Win95 (except being able to lock/unlock after Win95
starts) and sacrafices the least amount of system performance.

Also, remember that although the PGP key is 1024 bits, it generates a much
smaller IDEA key with 56 bits (I think... anyone?).  The 56 bit key is
vunerable to that $1 mil mystery machine that the NSA may or may not have.

@_subject: WARNING: SecureDrive & PartitionMagic 
It seems rather obvious now, but since I learned the hard way, I figured
that I'd save the rest of you from a painful experience.
I have one HD of 1.2gb.  I created a 50mb partition at the end of the drive
using PM and encrypted it with SD14b.  I ran out of room on the secured
partition and wanted to enlarge it.  I used PM to shrink the primary
partition a little, and to enlarge the secured partition.  When I shrank the
primary, the free space on the drive appeared between the two partitions.
To enlarge the secondary, I moved it to the free space, then enlarged it on
the right.  This was BAD!  PM did its thing, but no matter what I did after
that, I couldn't get the secured partition to a usable state.  I ended up
formatting the secured partition to recover.  After some playing, it seems that PM tries to "re-align" the data on the 2nd
partition when you move left.  That's where things get screwed up.  I tested
a few combinations, and found that everything works fine if you decrypt the
partition before moving/resizing, then re-encrypt after.
Just some friendly info.                                                       G.C.G.

@_subject: What about making re-mailers automatically chain? 
Would it be a good idea to have a re-mailer "randomly" decide whether to
send the mail to the destination or to another re-mailer.  If all
re-mailers performed this way, not even the sender would know the path.
The chain could be short sometimes and long others.  Granted, there is a
possibility that every mailer decides to chain instead of sending the
message to the recip, but some clever counter tag could keep the number of
links to a certain maximum.  The "randomness" of this would aid in traffic
analysis, and of course each mailer that decides to chain the mail would
encrypt under the next mailer's pub key.  Any thoughts?

@_subject: Re: What about making re-mailers automatically chain? 
That's what I was going for.  The re-mailer would only add links if the recip that it sees is another mailer.  If it doesn't recognize the destination as a remailer, it must assume that it's the last link and should send the mail.  If that doesn't happen Dave's right.  Multiple mailers would know the final dest.  The question I was heading for on this is: Does this add anything useful?  Removing knowledge of the path from the sender is a plus.  This prevents anyone, even the sender, from being able to give up any useful info even if under court order.  Adding "random" traffic is helpful 'cause many people (including myself) use pre-fab anon scripts and therefore use the same anon paths all the time (I should stop that).  This opens those messages up to some analysis and the possibility of the sender being revealed.
Granted, these are not major items.  The real question is:
Is this worth implementing?  As gbroiles said:

I thought we had a 5th amendment.  Isn't turning over your key that may (or

Haven't there been dozens of famous witnesses (Patty Hurst, Oliver North,
etc) that "take the 5th" dozens of times on the stand.  Why couldn't I
"take the 5th" when asked for my encryption keys?  When asked for your key,
can't you say: "I'm sorry your honor, but I respectfully refuse to answer
that question on the grounds that it may incriminate me.".
Any legal-eagles out there?

@_subject: Re: DES cracker. 
Actually, there are several methods.  The most common one by far is called
IBM3624.  That uses 12 digits of the Primary Account Number (PAN), which in
most cases is the card number, and encrypts it with DES.  That result is
then "decimalized" to change all hex letters to numbers.  The first n
digits of that result are then used to perform a MOD10 subtract from the
customers selected PIN.  That result is called an offset and is stored on
track 2 of the card, the bank's database or both.

ATALLA INKS AGREEMENT WITH RSA DATA SECURITY INC. TO
PROVIDE OPEN CRYPTO-API FOR NEW SET INTERNET PAYMENTS TOOLKIT
Atalla's PayMaster Internet Security Processor (ISP)
will provide enhanced SET performance and secure key
management capabilities for new RSA toolkit-based applications
SAN JOSE, CA -November 4, 1996- Atalla, a Tandem Company
(r), today announced that it has signed an agreement with RSA
Data Security Inc., to develop an open Application Programming
Interface (API) that will become a key component of RSA's new
SET payments toolkit. The suite of tools from RSA is being built
to enable developers to deploy secure SET-capable applications
quickly, with transparent access to the strongest commercial
Internet security functionality.
The new API developed by Atalla, will access the
command set to Atalla's PayMaster Internet Security Processor
(ISP) product to accelerate SET protocol performance and to
manage cryptographic keys securely. The new SET Toolkit suite
from RSA is designed to provide banks, cardholders, merchants
and application providers with the ability to deploy secure SET-
based applications without specialized cryptographic expertise.
Atalla will be one of seven companies that will support the RSA
SET toolkit. The other companies are Open Market Inc., NEC,
Netscape, Tandem Computers Inc., Verifone and Verisign.
The SET protocol specifies how cardholders, merchants,
issuing banks and acquiring banks will interact to ensure secure
payment processing over the Internet. SET relies on specially
developed encryption technology from RSA Data Security Inc.,
and has been adopted by Visa and MasterCard to secure credit card
transactions, authorization and settlement information over
public networks such as the Internet.
"The development of the SET protocol was an important
milestone in securing commerce over the Internet." said Robert
Gargus, president and general manager of Atalla.  "We believe
that the combination of new, RSA-based SET  tools and the strong
security functionality and high throughput provided by our Atalla
PayMaster Internet Security Processor will now help transform
public networks such as the Internet, into a secure, high-
performance payments infrastructure that banks, merchants and
cardholders will trust."
"We consider integration with the Atalla PayMaster ISP a
critical feature of the RSA SET developer's suite," said Jim Bidzos,
president of RSA Data Security, Inc.  "The Atalla PayMaster, in
combination with RSA,  will now allow for cost-effective, high-
volume SET application servers through greatly improved
performance for the underlying cryptography and strong physical
protection for private keys.  We believe this will overcome a
major barrier to the adoption of secure electronic commerce on
the Internet."
Atalla's PayMaster ISP product was designed specifically to
manage the cryptographic requirements specified by the SET
protocol.  The protocol requires multiple public key operations for
each SET transaction.  The Atalla PayMaster ISP product offloads
these computationally-intensive tasks from server CPUs and
isolates private information intended solely for merchants from
private information intended solely for banks. This ensures that
data cannot be altered at any point in the network, and accelerates
the required SET -specified public-and-private key operations.
Atalla's PayMaster ISP also provides RSA and DES-based
cryptography to provide a high-performance bridge from the
Internet to private networks such as the Bank Payments network.
