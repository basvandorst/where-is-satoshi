people, who talk to people, etc.)have been on one? You get software released on 4 Jun (for example), on 6 June it's cracked, and by 7 June, it is available on every single continent (barring Antarctica - although i'm not certain about that - supposedly there are equally private internet nodes around somewhere...). While the might of bands like Paranoimia, Skid Row, and Razor 1911 are usually concentrated on games, their expertise applies equally well to "serious" software - it's just that games are more marketable/popular and thus get the crackers' names to more people.
software is cracked and distributed within HOURS of release.

gunk - when you start off, have a centralized bank server. While traffic is low, you can have each individual certificate cleared with the bank server upon creation and execution. After that, things start getting tricky. Maybe a network of bank servers linked by high priority internet links (i don't suppose there really is such a thing, but this is dreamland, after all). This would mean that to cash a certificate more than once would require very fast and accurate timing, and if you combine this with a fairly low upper limit for certificate value, it becomes a waste of time try.

they are transmitting quite a great deal of info, and stegging in a message is quite feasible, is it not? You don't even have to do much of a hardware modification. Do something like having an HF carrier tone in the background, that anyone listening to it can't detect without the knowing what they're listenong for. Or insert a microburst transmission - it'll look like static.

 Seems to me, if one is talking about videophone type devices,
they are transmitting quite a great deal of info, and stegging in a

 This is not to say, that the clip chip isn't worth fighting

it. It's human nature, really.

collated into one block, have some random length padding added, and then encrypt the whole thing and send it back to you. If you have this all done automatically by the server at the haven, then you may not even need to call all of those random other messages down. That is, assuming you trust the sysadmin of that haven, which is probably not the best of ideas.
Maybe someone should (or already has) written a client which will take your message, pad it with some extra gibberish, then construct all of the headers necessary (and encrypt several times along the way) to post it along a path of remailers which either the user inputs, or it randomly determines. Seems to me that if you leave the actual routing in the hands of the user, and not at the discretion of the first remailer you send it to, you gain a far more secure transmission. Of course i could be wrong...
well. ie, insert something like Padding: ***
(presumably it was sent to a remailer that supports encryption) it should discard whatever comes after the ***, or however it happens to be implemented. This gives yet another layer of obfuscation between me and whoever doesn't like me...

the headers of the message, and work out wherethe message was posted from. Then, it's just a question of consulting SMTP and system logs, and the sysadmin has a fair chance of tracing you back. Perhaps you heard of some guy who sent a death threat to the president using this method? They traced him back REAL fast.
remove hundreds of identities (or more, depending on when some sysadmin notices the suspicious batch job running in bground). There's lots of ways to fake this, so i agree, you'd have to work from a list of registered voters - and hope that no one person is represented on that list too many times.

to implode a hollow sphere of the material. While this technique is
superficially similar to the gun-type triggering used by U-235 fuelled
bombs, the geometry prevents the Pu-239 from fissioning prematurely.

bomb, you are quite correct - the tritium-deuterium/tritium fusion
reaction gives the boom. However, in a three-stage bomb, there is an
additional fission reaction, this due to the fact that the neutrons
produced by the fusion reaction have the precise energy required to
fission U-238. Since U-238 is vastly easier to obtain than enriched
U-235, there is no great problem with sticking in half a tonne of it.
Around that you can add cobalt jackets, etc, for more interesting

right. As long as you thump together two barely sub-critical masses, it
will go boom. However, if you try this with plutonium, it will fizzle.
In the time that it takes for a standard gun type triggering mechanism
to operate, the plutonium will become critical, and then release most of
it's energy harmlessly, instead of going super-critical. This is the
reason for using fast-triggering bomb geometries.

narrow it down to one of two things. It's either the 'neutron bomb', in
that it just starts throwing very energetic neutrons that will wipe out
anything living, but not do property damage, or it's the polloution
variant, which lets your boring old low-yield device poson the
countryside for the next billion-odd years. I think it's the latter -
but I'm not really certain. *shrug* sorry. Read some books on it - the
amount of literature which should be classified but is freely available
