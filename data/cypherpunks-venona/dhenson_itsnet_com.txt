@_subject: Now You Can Own a 'Munitions Tshirt' 
Now you can wear a TSHIRT that has been classified as a MUNITION by the US Goverment. That's right! The US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) makes exporting cyrptographic materials illegal. ITAR further defines export as providing cryptographic information to a non-US/Canadian citizen even if you are inside the US at the time. Providing information is further defined as telling or showing information to a non-US/Canadian citizen. The Munitions Tshirt has a Perl implementation of the RSA algorithm (the one used by PGP) printed on the front along with a bar-code of the same algorithm.
What all the above means is that if you wear the Munitions Tshirt where a non-US/Canadian citizen can see it, even if it is inside the US, you have just exported cryptographic material (which is already freely available outside the US) and have become a criminal in the eyes of the US Government. Now you too can become an international arms dealer for the price of a tshirt (US$15.95 - US$19.95, depending on size) and the guts to wear it.
If you are a non-US/Canadian citizen, you can still own a Munitons Tshirt by ordering the tshirt from a source that is outside the US. The email response to a request for info (see next paragraph) includes full instructions for ordering the tshirt no matter where you live.
For more information on how to own this classic example of civil disobedience, just send email to dhenson with the subject of 'SHIRT'. (You don't have to be a US/Canadian citizen to request the info.) Or, if you have WWW access, just point your Web browser to:
     By the way, 25% of the profits from the sale of the tshirt (in the US/Canada) goes to the PHIL ZIMMERMANN LEGAL DEFENSE FUND to help defend the author of PGP from harassment and possible prosecution by the Fedgoons.
And if you get arrested for wearing the Munitions Tshirt, we'll refund your purchase price.  :-)

Sorry. I show no order for anyone named Goen, no orders from anyone named Mario, and only one order from anyone at Sun. Are you sure you ordered from me or did you order from Joel? (Who I understand has been a bit slow in filling his orders.) If you want to order from me, I have included email and USnail ordering instructions at the end of this message.
I'm not in the business of setting up defense funds. If you have one, I would be happy to publicize it. Send me your story.
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
MUNITIONS TSHIRT ORDER INFO (That you requested)
Either cost only (UK), or 25% proceeds to Phil Zimmermann (US).
We now have 2 suppliers, one in the US (WEPIN, for US & Canadians only), and one in the UK (Adam Back) for the 'free world', you know places like Europe (with the strange exception of France), Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan, etc, etc.
If you are a citizen of and living in the US or Canada:
 US orders (25% of proceeds to the Phil Zimmermann legal defense fund):
        (It's all set up for WWW forms, you can use VISA, M/C, or personal check
to buy on-line, or you can order via PGP-encrypted email.)
Tshirts are black 100% cotton Beefy-T with white printing. On the front
of the shirt are the words 'RSA encryption in perl'. Below that is a perl
script that implements the RSA algorithm for arbitrary keylengths. Below
that is a machine-readable barcode of the same perl script. On the back
of the shirt are the words 'WARNING This t-shirt is a munition' along with
the ITAR and USC references that make it a munition that is illegal to
export. You can see a mockup of the design by pointing your Web browser
to the URL Here's the prices, but order through the web page if you can, all on-line, Tshirts only (no sweatshirts), and only in black:
   Large:    $15.95
   X-Large:  $15.95
   2X-Large: $17.95
   3X-Large: $19.95
No tax, shipping, or handling charges. Just send a message (PGP encrypted recommended - see my key below) to dhenson with your desired shipping address, the quantity of each size that you want, and total amount of the order along with payment info. (See below, after my PGP key, for what info you need to include.) MAKE YOUR CHECK OR MONEY ORDER PAYABLE TO 'ALH'. It is also a good idea to include your telephone number and email address in case there are questions about your order. (All this plus payment info can be sent via the Web page.)
You can send Visa/MasterCard info and personal check info in email or via the Web page order form. If you want to pay any other way, you will have to send your order via USnail to:
     West El Paso Information Network (Tshirt)
     6112 N. Mesa      El Paso, Texas 79912
Here's my PGP public key (use to encrypt your order). Don't forget to
remove the '- ' at the beginning and the end of the block.

Here are some testimonials from a few of our many satisfied customers:
"Got mine this afternoon.  Wooohhaah!!  Already had some folks at
Blockbusters point, mumble to themselves, and then ask me what the
munitions warning meant.  This is going to be fun!!  I'm a cyphernerd
for sure..."
"Thanks for the great T-shirt.  I'm making copies of your paper order form for others."
"I think I'll have to wear the shirt over to Logan Airport and hang around the International Arrivals terminal a few times.   "
"I received the T-shirt on 8/3.  Thank you, it has been a pleasure dealing with you!"
"The first thing that I did after it arrived was to don it and then go
visit the office of one of our visiting researchers from Russia.  :)~"
