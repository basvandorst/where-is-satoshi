but if it turns out that 30% of home PCs have to be seized to prevent
dissemination of dangerous-information-X?
though we're not quite there yet... eg, it's a little expensive to run
your own httpd 24 hours/day.

depends.  prohibition was a failure.  information is much easier to
duplicate and conceal, spy thrillers aside.  many people find it hard
to justify information being dangerous, especially if it's something
innocuous like just another cryptosystem, or just another penis.
compare with software piracy.  when was the last time a kid in your
neighborhood was busted for unlicensed copying of software?  and
software is big business, lots of suits and $$$.  they can try to make
disassemblers illegal, but it's not likely to succeed.

in the Portland Oregon area, the price ranges from $234/year to
$1750/year for unlimited ppp access.  (I have no idea how long the
$234/year is going to stay in business.  that won't even cover the
cost of a phone line.)

urrr.  yes?  anyone doing international shipping has to comply with
customs regulations anyway.  this isn't really any different.  (except
when telecom or broadcast media become involved.)
(excuse me while I see if I can ship smallpox to germany.)

actual report is at offhand, I don't have a basis for grokking the numbers,
because I've never been an unwed mother with two children
under 5yrs old.  if they had done numbers for a single male
with no children, I'd have a better chance of knowing how
attractive welfare would be over random lowpaying jobs I
used to have.
I find it very odd that the study does an elaborate benefits
calculation for a mother without a job, but doesn't do a
similar calculation for a mother with an entry-level job.
this would be a directly meaningful comparison.
instead, it tries to convert welfare benefits to "pretax
wage equivalent", which is just silly.  people with a pretax
income of $30k/yr probably have a health plan paid for by
their employer, which invalidates the comparison being made.
something else that's iffy is inclusion of median housing
assistance paid out by agencies, rather than median received
by the sample population.  this means the model individual
is a nonworking unwed mother of two infants who gets housing
assistance, rather than just any nonworking unwed mother of
two infants on welfare.
report rejected:
  meaningless numbers
  thesis not supported by the evidence
