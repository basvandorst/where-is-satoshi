@_subject: protection on IoMega ZIP drives 
This is in regard to the now popular ZIP disks, the removable 100MB
cartridge for PC's/MAC's.
Anyone have any idea how secure the ZIP disk is once it is "protected?"  I
know that the disk will refuse to be mounted without the passkey, but what
is really happening here?

I have seen monetary items represented as integers, with the software
assuming that the last two digits are actually the "cents" part of the
float.  There are still round off problems with this scheme, but the
calculations are much faster since they are integers.
