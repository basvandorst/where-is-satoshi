Also add a warning dialog on any form post that includes a file upload.
This will prevent any re-occurance of the JavaScript bug I was about
to exploit in 2.01 that let code upload files without the user's knowledge.
(That particular bug is fixed in 3.0b2).

Ah, the new way to spam somebody.  Just forge an "unsubsrive" or "take me of"
messsage to cypherpunks.

Ha ha.  Very funny forgery.  The fool who forged the "unsubsrive" in my
name wasn't even clever.  He left his calling card all over the message:

Please undo your [collective] dirty work.

It's a shame he wrote all that C code when this suffices
also, you don't need to xxxx out the tags; Netscape downcases incoming HTML
and then uses strcmp().
