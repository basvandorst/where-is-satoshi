Love that in-depth technical reporting. to They're recycling an old USA Today piece. Turns out that figure was extrapolated by an internal investigation team trying to break into unclassified/non-secure systems. They just took the success rate for thier attacks and multiplied it by an arbitrary number to come up with an "annual" rate, according to the USA Today article.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Under plans to overhaul the airline security system,
making a plane reservation would trigger an instant profile of a
passenger's background, including past travels and possible criminal
history information.
Government should pay
The committee, made up of 23 industry, government and public interest
groups, suggested the federal government, not the airline industry, pay for
the increased security measures. It estimated the proposals would cost $9.9
billion over the next 10 years.
"It's not an airline or airport problem. It's a national security problem,"
Lally said. "Airports and airlines are surrogate targets. The real targets
are the policies and government of the United States."

Flew down to LA recently with a firearm (checked, of course).
Looking over the ticket later, I was mildly surprised to find "GUN" in
a string of otherwise unintelligible text.
Anyone know if this is they way it's been, or if this is YA "Anti-terrorism
security measure"? Goes without saying that this data would most likely
wind up as part of the "travel profiles" the gov't wants to compile. Could
they be starting early?
The carrier was Alaska Airlines, if it matters.
As far as the photo-id went, they didn't copy any data off it or try to
authenticate, just made sure it was my picture.

I doubt it- if everyone has no choice but to pay, why would software companies
lower prices? What would happen is a) less pirated software floating
around, and
b) software companies make much more money. I don't see prices coming down.
It doesn't have to break.
Example: Advertising agency, each designer's machine has at least $10k worth
of software on it. We upgrade the machine, we have to spend another $10k to
buy new software, or go through administrative hassle with the vendor to
get 'new' copies of the software?
Speaking from a Sysadmin's perspective, I wouldn't use one if you gave me
the hardware for free. With this scheme, the programmers benefit, the
end-users don't, and it's the end-users who have to buy into this for it
to work.

Presented in a "this will help 911" context. Still disconcerting.
Companies working on the technology to track cellular phone calls
have been given additional incentive with a Federal Communications
Commission order that all cell phone service companies have location
programs in place by the year 2001.

If I might make a suggestion:
Some people want moderation. That's fine, I've never been very big on
letting other people choose what I read, but some people want it.
For those who want it, let someone moderate the list for as long as
they care to do it. Approved messages get a "X-sandy-approved"
header. The responsibility for setting up a filter to toss everything
that doesn't have the header is the responsibility of the end user.
Toad will need to filter incoming posts to make sure they don't come
"pre-approved", but that's the only hole I can think of.
Everyone gets all of the Cypherpunks list. Those who want moderation
filter the unapproved posts, those who want all of it get all of it.
Hopefully, this will make (almost) everyone happy.

Just add an anti-spam segment to your email address.
Most people worth talking to have enough of a clue to replace [at] with if your software requires an apparently valid email address, try
I put a spam-busted address in my .sig and give root as my email
in the from: header. Sure, somebody out there is going to be unhappy with
me, but if they have a clue they'll figure it out. Meantime, the SpamBots
are bouncing mail to the admin of the site instead of to me.
That may not be enough if you're already in the spamming lists. Try
using 'positive' filtering- instead of filtering to eliminate unwanted
mail, filter email from regular correspondents into a 'approved'
directory, and leave the rest in the inbox to pick through later.
It seems very strange that the denziens of this list, reputed to be gutsy
enough to take on the FBI, NSA, CIA, and White House, would be scared
away from a discussion forum (Usenet) by uninvited email.
We'd better hope they never figure out Cypherpunks, Guardians of
Privacy and Defenders of Free Speech, are afraid of spam.
(And supposedly the 'Moderation experiment' is over, so this won't get
kicked onto the -flames list, although it's more ridicule than flame...)
