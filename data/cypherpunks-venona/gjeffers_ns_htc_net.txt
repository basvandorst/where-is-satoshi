@_subject: recent ( 3 months ) software developements? 
Dear Cypherpunks,
   Due to really lousey circumstances, I have been unable to monitor my
mail for the last 3 months. Also, last 3 months mail currently unavailble
to me. I am interested in finding out if there have been any new soft-
ware offerings or software upgrades in that time. My particular interest
is Dos/Windows. Also, locations where software can be downloaded. Note
that a brief description of recent software developements maybe helpful
to other Cypherpunks with little time to monitor Cypherpunks list.
                                                   Beat State,

                        Is the IRS a paper tiger?
   One definition of a pioneer is a guy with an arrow in his back. So
notice the above headline is a question, not an assertion. But it is
nonetheless a question being asked by a lot of folks these days, from
Bill Archer, Chairman of House Ways & Means, to a number of smart tax
attorneys. The federal tax code has mutated into this gigantically in-
comprehensible Rube Goldberg monstrosity that day by day gets closer to
collapsing under its own weight. Couple that with the fact that the IRS
computer system is about to go belly up. The IRS originally computerized
itself AD HOC, with the regional centers getting various platforms and
software that can't communicate with each other very well. The agency has
now spent over $8 billion on the TSM project to re-computerize, which an
independent review recently concluded is a colossal failure.
   As the IRS teeters on the brink, a fellow named Eddie Kahn has stepped
forward and may be about to push the whole creaking mess over the edge.
He hasn't got an arrow in his back yet, so he might just succeed. Dis-
dainful of "tax protests" such as 5th Amendment or legal tender arguments
that quickly get their advocates behind bars, Eddie looked into the stru-
ture of federal law. When Congress passes a law, codified as a statute,
it then delegates to a regulatory agency the authority to issue the im-
plementing regulations specifiying to whom and under what circumstances
the statute applies. These regulations must, by law, be published in the
Federal Register. Lacking these implementing regulations, the law cannot
be applied and has no force. Well, it turns out that the implementing re-
gulations for IRS' enforcement statutes-things like the requirement to
file a tax return and the authority to place a lien-cannot be found in
the Federal Register. When queried on this, the General Counsel for the
Office of the Federal Register, Michael White, replied in writing, "Our
records indicate that the Internal Revenue Service has not incorporated
by reference in the Federal Register a requirement to make an income tax
   This is starting to get interesting, isn't it? And yes, I see that big
smile on your face. If Eddie is right, the IRS has no assessment autho-
rity, no collection athority to enforce a lien or seize property, no au-
thority to pursue criminal penalties for failure to file a return or make
a false/fraudulent return. I am not at all suggesting you be a pioneer.
But if you should have any difficulty with the lovable folks at the IRS,
you might consider making an appointment to see them in person at their
nearest office, and tell them face to face that you need to see a copy
of the implementing regs published in the Federal Register that show
they have the authority to require you to do what they want. Not one of
the close to a thousand people who, following Eddie's advice, have done
so received a copy-and not one has been further harassed. Better to let
these folks drop out of the system quietly than risk a negative decision
in court, which would be for them an ultimate catastrophe. You can get

@_subject: (X:x)e$ 's other use 
(X=:x)e$ 's other use.
My dear fellow Cypherpunks,
   I believe that secret e$'s other use has been overlooked: That is,
e$ would be a sound money replacement for the corrupt currency that
every large state in the world currently pushes. Especially if e$
can be redeemed in something of real value on demand.
   As some of us know, the U.S. Fed State's Federal Reserve Notes are
corrupt currency. The corruption is at 5 different levels:
1. They are DEBT currency - they are lent into existence and it is
mathematically impossible to pay off this debt. If you borrow $100, then
where do you get the interest - say 8% since all FRN's are borrowed into
existence?. This turns the great majority of Americans into victims. If
you want freedom for your citizens, you do NOT allow monopoly DEBT
currency. Note: bankruptcies & good counterfeiting are the only ways.
2. Fractional Reserve Banking. That means that the bank can lend out
several times the money that it actually has. I believe that that is
currently 8 times but that is a rough estimation.
3. Fiat money. That means that FRN's are backed by nothing more than the
willingness of banks to redeem them with other FRN's.
4. Private banks with monopoloy privledges issue the currency. The
Federal Reserve is a private (non-U.S. State) institution with the mono-
poly on U.S. currency manufacture. The U.S. Treasury prints the currency
for the Federal Reserve. Other major states have similar arrangements. These
major banks are properly called Central Banks. To turn your currency
ownership over to a private Central Bank is monstrous! If the people
knew what was going on, the U.S. Federal State would be destroyed along
with the hidden ruling class.
5. The Legal Tender Laws. These laws force the acceptance of FRN's
in the U.S.. "This money good for all debts public and private".
   Note that the book DREAMS COME DUE made the distinction between money
and currency. The author used the word money for real money and the word
currency for false money. It may be the author's private distinction.
    I suggest that Iran did us a good turn in making and passing billions
of dollars worth of uncatchable hundred dollar bills: they allowed the
retirement of billions of dollars of debt for the American people without
forcing Americans into bankruptcy. In a debt currency economy, good count-
terfeiting is GOOD! It adds superior counterfeit to the mass of "legiti-
mate" counterfeit. kind of improves the pool :-)
   Secret e$ offers the possibility of ridding ourselves of the slavery
of private monopoly money issue. It would also give us a choice in what
currency that we would like to use. Another possibility is that due to its
high quality, it would be used during depressions and would possibly
even break depressions. Its extremely FLUID nature might also be a pro-
tection against depressions. It would be a TRUE MONEY and would give the
people the advantages of true money. Let me emphasize: we do not current-
ly have REAL money nor do the people of the other major States. We do not
know what real money is like.
   Another possibility exists with secret e$: that several different kinds
could exist. They would all be convertible into each other, of course.
Major differences?: Different redeemablity schemes, etc..
   Secret e$ offers more that just the freedom of private transactions
(as great as that is). It also offers us the power and freedom of true
Central power is stolen freedom.

e$'s (mini-rant)
   I have some thoughts on John Humphrey's post. I thought the big problem
with E$ was with the clearing house. Is it the consensus that it is the e$
patents?  If the problem is that the inventors are sitting on their
patents, then why can't we just RIP THEM OFF$
   When the patent system was started in the U.S., it was done for the
population in order to stimulate the invention process and so improve the
lot of the people. Invention is a SPECIAL kind of production. It is not
normal mass property! Patents are only property because it is considered
that they are of value to the people rather than the owners! Patents pro-
cess was started to give property to patent "owners" in order to persuade
the inventors to invent for the people. If an inventor "SITS ON A PATENT",
then it is ABUSE OF PATENT! Fuck the patent owner! Fuck him with bells on!
RIP HIM OFF! its a noble cause! If this has become a serious problem then
finding techniques of riping off e$ patent owners is a moral and practical
undertaking. Then it should be a topic of Cypherpunks.
   I am not sure that hoarding of patents is the main hinderance of useful
e$. What do other Cypherpunks say? patents? workable e$ schemes! clearing-
P.S. Maybe doing private Internet business while hiding from the owner of
the e$ patent will be a new privacy concern :-)
P.P.S. Thoughts for a rip-off technique. Take a good private e$ tech.,
restate it in different terms, throw in a few changes, options, extras
so it doesn't look so much like the original. Then offer it to the public
with a variety of very low cost deals - especially for start-ups. By the
time the original inventor gets you into court, you'll have a ton of money
he'll have nothing and with our system of "justice" you can bury him. :-)
Even if he "wins"  - with your privacy skills you can take it with you and
hide it - talk to Duncan Frissell. Note: You'll have the money to talk to
Duncan, the original inventor won't. :-)
P.P.P.S Why not just take the best features of several private e$ tech.s
and make a hybrid? It wouldn't even be plaguerism! (sorry, I lost my dict-
