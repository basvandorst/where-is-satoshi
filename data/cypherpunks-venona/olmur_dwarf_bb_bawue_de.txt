In Chaum's system spending a coin is a cut-and-choose protocol: with
overwhelming probability you reveal informations about your ID, when
you present your e-coin a second time.

Mondex keeps their protocols confidential.  Not so good to establish
trust in the system.
I also heart _rumours_, that several things went wrong in their
current field-test.  Reminds me that I should go after these rumors.
Additionally several banks begin to establish their own e-cash
systems.  E.g. in Germany from 1st January 1997 on nearly every
bank-customer will have an electronic-purse.
The main problem with e-cash proposed by Chaum et al. is that current
SmartCards are not powerful enough to handle the needed computation in
a timely fashion.
The purse proposed by the german banks you have a simple counter on
your SmartCard.  With this system you _must_ have identification of
payer and payee to clear malfunctions or frauds by either party.

It's illegal in Germany to publish material denying the holocaust.  In
the same moment this guy sent his book (?) per snail-mail from Canada
to Germany he commited a crime here in Germany.
I don't think it's astonishing that Denmark imprissoned this guy and
transported him to Germany.  It's a normal thing that one country
imprisons a criminal another country is searching and the delivers
him/her to the country in question.
Have a nice day!

The difference is, that the German government was not ordering this

Denying the holocaust is not 'something offensive to the German
government' but something that hurts the feeling of the people whose
relatives were murdered by the Nazis.
Free speech ends where other people can reasonable claim that their
feelings are badly hurt.

Mike's information is old.  Meanwhile it's explicitely forbidden to
deny the holocaust.

As said above: the law is explicite.  When I trade with another
country of course I have to obey this country's laws.  I mean if I
visit US I have to obey US-law.  If I know it or not.  If you visit
Germany, you have to obey German law.  If you know it or not.  The
same is with trade.

He imported illegal stuff into Germany.  If I import weapons to US

Due to our history publishing NAZI-propaganda is forbidden in Germany.
The big majority in Germany agrees with this view, that
NAZI-propaganda doesn't fall under 'free speech'. Some neo-NAZIs
publish their books in other countries and then illegally transfer
them to Germany.
BTW, many European countries forbid publishing NAZI-propaganda.  And
as far as I know Denmark plans to change their law, too.

When IBM internally transfer crypto-software to locations outside US
they have to keep
* Name of sender + receiver
* date of transmission
* method of transmission
I'd assume that with this personal-use exection you have to keep the
date of your travel and the location(s) you traveled to.  (Your name
might be something you remember without keeping track of it ;-)

Don't know about Intel, but IBM has an agreement with US-legislation,
that we can ship code, hardware and knowledge freely between all of
our locations.  An export-licence is only required when code/hardware
leaves the IBM-corporation.
Technically IBM-Germany is a _German_ company, so that ITAR would not
effect IBM-Germany.  However, the agreement between IBM-corporation
and US-legislation does have the desired effect (desired by US-legislation).
This seems to be the way how ITAR is enforced with multinational
corporations: they allow the very valuable exchange of knowledge, for
the prize of the corporation as a whole `voluntarily' obeying ITAR.
Of course all the usual disclaimers apply, ie I'm not a lawyer, don't
speak for IBM and the weather is not my fault either....

I think that's exactly where the problem lies.  The advantage of your

to look on the database, but I assume that Julf isn't interested in
the contents of the database anyways..
But for a real attacker it's just a small inconvinience, nothing more.

I think it's similar to a postmaster running a script to automatically

it.  But I don't think it's really making penet-style servers more

I'd assume that the magic word here is "banks".  It's usually no
problem to export strong crypto from US, if it's used only for banking
purposes.  IBM delivers SmartCards with full Triple-DES to
bank-customers in Germany: absolutely no problem.
My personal oppinion is, that banks
a) don't encrypt arbitrary data, but only specific accounting data
b) banks can be quite easily house-searched, if you really want to get
   a hold on their data
