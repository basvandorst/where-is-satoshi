So I guess we'll need some computers in outer space, on offshore boats
or in well-bribed stable dictatorships.

First, pray tell, what prevents me from writing a virus that patches,
say, Eudora and Netscape, so they automatically reply to all FV-mails?
Or, to quote your security FAQ:
... which is plainly and unencrypted visible in the E-Mails ...
... which is in the header of said E-Mail ...
... which is quite impossible unless you have your own FV shop,
monitor IP traffic or a *malicious program on the user's computer* ...
... which said malicious program is of course completely unable to do ...
Wow! I didn't think of that!
And while I'm at it, it doesn't take much to be more secure than
credit card payments. You shouldn't be too proud of that.
And it shouldn't take an experienced programmer one whole week to
write a keyboard sniffer.
But I think it's not too pessimistic to say that _any_ software-based
payment scheme can be hacked using malicious programs.

Oh, wow, it's your secret. I would post a message containing the
credit card number encrypted with a public key cipher to
alt.foo.bar. Or to the IRC. And it's not too difficult to hack
university computers, so I could even receive mail there without being
traceable. Not to speak of remailer chains. Any other ideas?

This is unfortunately a wide-spread myth. While it's true for mail and
news, it's not for IP packets. Witness:

We'll see. I told the Admin of dfn.de nicely that his routing seems to
be broken. If he responds with pointing to the Zuendel site, I'll send
him the other URLs and ask him to stop routing to these sites as well.
P.S.: I need some fodder. Anyone else mirroring the site?

If you consider the client to be untrusted software, I'm afraid the
answer is probably not at all.
