anti-cry.. by Graham Toal This buffoon, BTW, is the article's author.
Do not flame him! This will serve only to justify his ideas. If,
however, you sent him a polite, well reasoned debate, it would probably
do a world of good. Also, if you present views that are "too radical,"
he will most likely discount you as a kook and thus ignore all of your
arguments and associate them with some dangerous revolutionary movement.
This is a bad thing.
