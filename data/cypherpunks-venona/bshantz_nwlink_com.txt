@_subject: Re: Exporting Mental States 
I just arrived in Ottawa, Canada from Seattle, USA.  I had sort of thought through exactly what Tim just described.  I had a little notebook with me and was doing some calculations and design of a fractal compression algorithm.  I started to think about El-Gamal and decided to look at elliptical curve algorithms.  So, I pulled out my copy of Applied Crypto to look up some things and started writing things down. (BTW: I had Applied Crypto with me for recreational reading on the plane, I don't normally carry it everywhere I go.)
Anyway, i got to customs in Ottawa, and they asked me if I had anything to declare.  I immediately thought, "Should I tell them about the notebook?"  I decided against it.  How does export of intellectual property work?
The other question they asked me was "Do you have any eggs?"  I started giggling.  **SARCASM ON** I always carry an egg around in my inside coat pocket.  Who knows when you might need one, especially when in a foreign country. **SARCASM OFF**  I don't know, I guess the question just struck me as funny.

Whoops, wrong.  BETA does not mean code "they know crashes."  In fact it is quite the opposite.  This is pre-release code that they are bug fixing.  most of the catastrophic bugs, they probably know about.  A BETA program is to increase the testing and quality assurance staff to find all of the bugs they DON'T know about.  Then, they will have a reasonable amount of time to fix those bugs before release.  It makes for a much more stable product.
Now, look at companies like SPRY/Compuserve or Logos Research Systems.  Both companies I have worked for.  SPRY didn't really have a BETA program that amounted to much until Internet in a Box version 1.0.  Even that was a lame beta program.  Mostly internal use and testing.  Logos (a Bible software company) never even had a beta program.  As much as I like the guys at Logos, they released version 2.0 recently and it's buggy.  Simple cosmetic things like not being able to "cancel" out of the options dialog, or "help" buttons taking you to wrong places in the help file, these are all things that would have been caught in a decent testing environment or a beta program.
Microsoft, who I don't necessarily like all the time, has a great beta program.  Usually it is several months to a year of intense testing, bug fixing, feature cleanup, usability testing, etc.  Their software may not be the best, but more often than not it is stable.
Anyway, I see Netscape's move to paying for beta testing will result in a more stable browser, and hopefully more secure software.
Why would they get bad press?
Once again, Josh, I'm afraid I have to disagree with you on this one.  Especially in regards to secure software.  I see your point, but...
Whether or not you have to report the bugs is immaterial.  Netscape is doing a service by making their app available for testing before saying "this is secure."  As a person who does business over the net, if I found out that my software was NOT secure, I would seek either a secure update or another company's software.  If  I'm happy with Netscape's software, I'll report the bugs to improve it's quality.  In my humble opinion, improving the software is reward enough.  Very few companies have paid beta programs.
I'd rather see bugs fixed before release than getting the bad press after release for shoddy workmanship.
Sorry this was so long.  I didn't mean to ramble.  I'll get off my soapbox now...

I have  been working for some time on a project that involves doing proactive file authorization/authentication under Windows NT.  In the process, I've been working on an extension to the Kernel layer of the operating system because we need to be able to catch read/writes to the disk.  (All perfectly legal according to the DDK, just ot documented worth a damn.)  All of this is designed to work directly with the functionality given to us by the NT-Security layer.
Basically, I'm now questioning the C2 rating of Windows NT.  The entire security layer is  modular to the Kernel.  As a modular driver, it can be removed, rewritten, and replaced.   So, what makes it secure?  What gives it the C2 Rating?  How would one go about getting a C2 rating?

Just as an interesting side note.....
I got lucky this weekend and found a First Edition copy of David Kahn's "The Code Breakers" at a little bookstore in Port Townsend, Washington.  WHAT A SHOCK!!!  Anyway, I snagged it for $25.00.  The cover has been laminated (library style, not card style) and it is in excellent condition.
For those wondering what the significance of Port Townsend is...well, there is none.  It is, however, the location of Fort Worden which is where "An Officer and a Gentleman" was filmed.  (Major piece of military history, isn't it?)
Anyway, if any one is looking for a copy, mine is not for sale, but the owner of the store said that she has seen copies come through every now and again.  (Not necessarily First Ed's)  If you are interested in getting in touch with the store, let me know.

Once upon a time last year or the year before, Tim May posted why he doesn't use PGP very often.  And I have always stood by that same sentiment.  Yes, it is a good encryption product, but it is not integrated seamlessly into other applications.  Tim, feel free to whack me if you think I'm speaking for you.  If, as cypherpunks, we want to spread the use of strong crypto, we need to have a better interface than what currently exists on PGP 2.6.2.  I'm sure Derek and the other guys on PGPlib will make it easier to integrate into applications.  Am I just blowing smoke, Mr. Atkins?
PGP is a pain for encrypting or signing e-mail when you have to save your message out to a temp file, encrypt it, and load it back in to your mail package.
Sure, there are things like Private Idaho, which I use on occasion.  But, it is still a seperate application that just doesn't fit seamlessly into most applications.
In my free time, I have been playing around with add ons for Microsoft Exchange.  I've got an OLE 2.0 encryption object that embeds nicely into an Exchange message.  I haven't tied it in to PGP yet, because I have been waiting for the release of PGPlib.  However, that will allow at least some seamless integration.

Tim May Wrote:
...yadda yadda yadda...more on how we all agree that burning children is not a viable option....etc.
It is so much more than what the "State" deems appropriate.  Having grown up with both parents being teachers in the public school system and my wife a teacher in a private Montessori school system, I've seen that the feeling in society is, "Everyone is a victim."
In seattle a few years ago, there was a teenager who killed his girlfriend. (beat her face in with a rock)  Yes, he was caught, yes he went to trial.  This 19 year old lame-o used this as his defense, "Fetal Alcohol Syndrome."   THEY LET THE MURDERER GO ON THE PRECEDENT IT WAS HIS MOTHER'S FAULT BECAUSE SHE HAD A FEW DRINKS WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH HIM.  So, he wasn't in control of his own actions?   I say bullshit to that.
At my wife's school the kids are being taught that the definition of harassment is if someone is doing something to you that you don't like.   Oh, the third graders have a heyday with this one.  "Chris is looking at me and I don't like it."   Immediately, Chris is repremanded because he is harassing the other kid. What's wrong with this picture?  Well, it's not Chris' problem, is it?  The teachers need to be a little more understanding of what harassment is.  Chris could turn around and say, "By reprimanding me, you are harassing me for something totally stupid."  There are so many different "syndromes" and "conditions" that you can't keep track of them all.  ADD, Hyperactivity, Fetal Alchohol Syndrome, Chronic Fatigue, Repetitive Stress (which is a physical ailment, but it came to mind), they are all names to psychological conditions.  Some because they are serious problems...like ADD in some children, but not all.  Some however are lame attempts by psychologists to put the human psyche into a bunch of prepackaged little boxes.  Eventually, you could build the perfect beast by just grabbing a handfull of syndromes from this box over here, mixing them with a few neuroses from this box over here.  Pour in a little Free Love, a little Self Preservation and give the entity a stopwatch in the shape of a heart and a scroll for a brain and you've got an average human being.
Sorry, no, thank you.
We are more a part of our environment than that.  Some people grow up to be just like their parents.  Some grow up to be the exact opposite.  However, our "raising" does have an effect on us.  At my wife's school, they do not use Ritalin.  They have started using a product called PhytoBears.   Don't laugh.  These are GummiBears made out of all natural vegetable extracts.   One of those, "100% of all the vitamins and minerals needed by the human body and mind in a day" kind of things.  Apparently, the kids who were on Ritalin are now getting on much better with PhytoBears than they were with Ritalin.
Yes, I've read this entire thread, I don't need loads of flame mail telling me to go back and read the ENTIRE THREAD again.  I just want to say that in many schools, at least in Washington, ADD is no longer being treated strictly with drugs.   Someone mentioned being put in a "special" class while his brother was in a regular class (or the other way around).  That is more common than an automatic prescription for Ritalin.   I still claim that ADD is a syndrome that is serious in some kids and for others it's a crutch.  The diagnoses in Washington are getting better.
Dr. Cynthia Tobias (who just happens to be from Seattle Pacific University, just a coincidence) has done studies for her entire doctoral carreer on the subject of learning patterns.  Her findings are interesting.  They aren't practical in a public school system, but interesting nonetheless.  There are a number of different learning styles.  I won't go into all of them for the sake of brevity (I know, too late.)  One of the learnign styles that she has spent much time working on is the Kinetic/Kinesthetic learner.   These are the kids who wander around, and fidget as Tim put it.  The goal of the teacher with a Kinetic learner is not to get them to sit down, but to get them to not distract others.  If the kid likes to do his work laying on the floor and he's not bothering anyone, let him.  There are some people (like me) who can't stand to sit at a desk all day long.  I get my work done, but I often lay on the floor, sit on the desk, walk around the office, etc.  Anyway, my point is that there are teaching practices that could be used to teach the child without resorting to labelling (as I think ADD is sometimes used) or drugs.
That is only in the example you provided, Tim.  Yes, if one person is doing it, there are probably more.  (It's like Cockaroaches....where there's Agreed.  The teachers at my High School and even at Oregon State University always had trouble convincing me of the validity of some of the topics we were learning.  I'm sure it bugged them when I asked.

@_subject: Inflation and Housing 
As a person in the process of buying a house, I see the price of mortgages in a slightly different light than just inflation.  Oh, it's still inflation, no argument there.  I see it mainly as a problem with debt.
Back in the early sixties (which I don't remember, by the way) houses cost just slightly over what the average salary was...cars cost considerably less.  Sometime right around then, there was a boom in people needing/getting credit.  In fact, I'd even be willing to say it was right after WWII when all the GI's suddenly hit the civillian economy and were buying houses, and getting into college with the new-fangled GI bill.
As a result of huge people getting large amounts of credit, we have become a debt ridden society.  Now it takes 40% of the "husband's" monthly income to go toward housing cost, whereas it used to be the 25% rule.  People don't even blink twice now when the terms of a 30 year fixed mortgage comes up.   That's "just the way it's done."
Now, I also see a problem with people my age (25) wanting what took their parents 30 years to get in the first 3 years out of school.  (i.e. Big house, 2 or 3 cars, kids, dogs, cats, horses, stocks, etc.)  It is rare now to see people buying a "starter" home and then selling it and moving on up.  Why?  Well in Seattle, the starter homes are in really "NASTY" areas of town.  Nobody wants to live there.   So, then the starter homes in "nice" areas that are bought are promptly remodelled and sold as "regular" homes.   Uh, hello, doesn't mean that another "starter" home has been removed from the market.  Anyway, my point is that people here aren't buying the starter homes, they are buying the bigger homes.   In order to do that, they have to take bigger loans.
Bigger loans mean that the cycle of debt continues.
So, yes salaries are 2x to 4x higher, but there is a problem in the amount of credit being given to young people.  There is something inherently wrong with the amount of our economy that deals with debt.   We can't continue to purchase things on margin, or on credit.   Another recession is going to come, and when it hits, it will hit HARD.  At least that's my opinion.
