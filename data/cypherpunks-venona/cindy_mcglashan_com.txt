@_subject: Re: Can the inevitability of Software privacy be used to defeat the              ITAR? (fwd) 
Nice try, but no cigar.  The problem with all of the "ITAR loophole" ideas
is that they only work where the rules are clearly articulated and carefully
followed by the administrative agencies.  Neither of those exist with the
ITAR..  There are no restrictions on the ODTC's ability to interpret the
ITAR however they see fit and to change those interpretations as they wish
to meet their goal: stopping folks from getting strong crypto easily.  The best example of this is the mislabelled "crypto with a hole,"  in which
ODTC interprets the regulations as allowing them to limit software with no
cryptography in it at all but only hooks which could allow the insertion of
crypto later.  The ITAR says that they only regulate "software with the
capability of maintaining secrecy" and so on its face would not extend to
software which only has hooks for crypto.  But this doesn't stop ODTC and
there is no mechanism in place to allow anyone else to  stop them short of a
lawsuit or a change in the law by Congress.
So, having said that, here's where I think they could fit in the "piracy"
sublicense maneuver:
First, entering into the sublicensing agreement could be interpreted as a
"defense service."  By giving them a license you are "assisting the foreign
person" because, presumably, life is easier for them if they have a license.
Second, call the sub-license agreement "technical data" since it is related
to the crypto.
Or, as they did with Zimmermann, they just assume that the company had
something to do with the unauthorized export and begin an investigation.  If
it goes to indictment, better hope you have iron-clad evidence to convince
the jury that you had nothing to do with it.  If  you've gone ahead and
sub-licensed afterwards, making money off of the illegal act, I think it
would be difficult to convince a jury that you didn't have something to do
with it.  Gotta write a brief now,

@_subject: Stay issued; modified stay to follow 
During a conference call with counsel today, Judge Patel issued a stay of
the injunctive relief issued in her Opinion of August 25, 1997, effective
until September 8.  On September 8 (or sooner if we get the papers to her) the Court she will
issue a formal Stay Pending Appeal which will stay the injunctive relief
issued in her Opinion of August 25, 1997, except that an injunction shall be
reinstated to prevent the prosecution of Professor Bernstein for the
"unlicensed export" of Snuffle 5.0 (which includes Snuffle and Unsnuffle)
and any later versions of that program which he has developed.
This eliminates, at least for the meantime, the injunctive relief granted to
Bernstein as to any other computer programs which he may have developed or
otherwise wished to publish.  It also eliminates the protections for persons
other than Professor Bernstein.
The government has said that it may still challenge this more limited stay
in the 9th Circuit.  Professor Bernstein may also seek relief from the stay
from the 9th Circuit.

Here is the text of my testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee's

March 17.
TESTIMONY OF CINDY A. COHN; there have been very many hearings and much discussion about cryptography
here in Washington, this is the first, I believe, to seek testimony from one
of the attorneys directly involved in the legal challenges to the
cryptography regulations.
Department of Justice, et al.  With the help of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, Professor Daniel J. Bernstein has been trying for over six years
to publish on the Internet a simple cryptographic computer program which he
wrote.  He has been told that if he does, he will be prosecuted.  hobbyists, should not have to submit their own work prior to publication to
faceless government bureaucrats.  This is especially so when those same
bureaucrats have unchecked discretion to bar them from publishing his work.
That is what the current scheme allows.  In fact, before we brought suit
those same agency bureaucrats told Professor Bernstein that publishing an
academic paper about his software would be illegal and that putting his
software into a public library would be illegal.  The Federal District Court
for the Northern District of California has agreed with us that the
regulations are in violation of the First Amendment on their face, meaning
that they violate the First Amendment rights of all Americans, not just
Professor Bernstein.  Department of State, is here in D.C. District Court.  The Karn case is the
clearest example of the quip often made about the Administration's
cryptography policy--that it is based upon the belief that terrorists can't
type.  Mr. Karn was told that, although a book containing computer source
code could be freely sent abroad, a floppy disk containing the exact same
information could not.  The second case, Junger v. Christopher, is in
Cleveland, Ohio, and is based upon the government's position that Professor
Junger, a law professor at Case Western University could be prosecuted for
teaching a Computers and the Law course in his usual way.

restrictions on cryptographic software on the grounds that they are in
violation of the First Amendment.  Although our case focuses, as it must, on
the current regulations, the analysis would apply as well to proposed
domestic restrictions which would restrict or license the creation,
distribution or receipt of cryptographic software.  Indeed, the
constitutional problems which would arise if domestic controls were imposed
are even more severe than those of the current scheme.   regulations violate is prior restraint of speech.  The Bernstein case
focuses on the  easiest flaws to see in the current scheme--the lack of
procedural protections.  The Supreme Court has long held that if the
government wants to institute a prepublication licensing scheme, it must
case rather than act administratively; This comes from a seminal Supreme Court case called Freedman v. Maryland. legal analysis, we were not the first to see this problem.  In fact, the
first people to point out this problem in the regulations were in the
Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in 1978.  You see, the agencies
have known for 20 years that this scheme is unconstitutional.  Their own
lawyers told them so.  That is why you never hear them mention the First
Amendment in their presentations to you.
legislation, is that source code is protected expression for purposes of the
First Amendment.  On this point, the administration largely agrees.  Let me
repeat that--the Administration has not denied that in regulating computer
software it is also regulating the "expressive activities" of Americans.
This conclusion, which is obvious to anyone who has ever written or read a
computer program, is also consistent with what Congress has repeatedly
acknowledged.  Software is treated as identical to other forms of protected
expression in both the Copyright Act and the Freedom of Information Act.  break any dramatic new ground.  It simply asks the courts to recognize that
the First Amendment extends to science on the Internet, just as it does to
science on paper and in the classroom.  For it is this scientific freedom
which has allowed us to even have an Internet, as well as the many other
technologies which we enjoy today.	   decided by the Federal District Court.  My legal team and I believe that
there are other strong Constitutional reasons which prevent the regulation
of cryptographic software. The District Court did not need to address these
additional reasons, since it agreed with us that the first alone was
sufficient to invalidate the regulations. regulation which institutes a licensing scheme, or any other form of prior
restraint, pass the strictest of tests.  Even a claim of national security
or public safety must be carefully weighed against our fundamental rights,
and must be supported with hard evidence of direct, immediate and
irreparable harm, not just conjecture and a few frightening scenarios.  subject of cryptography and treats that speech differently from speech on
other topics must pass the tests of strict scrutiny--that the regulation
address a compelling government interest and be narrowly tailored to reach
only that interest and no further.  That is, the government's concern about
national security cannot reach so broadly as to prevent law-abiding citizens
from having access to software which they can use for completely lawful
purposes.  Put into another context, it means that the government cannot
require all of us to deposit our house keys with them on the off chance that
one of us is a criminal.
actually meet their goals.  Here, such proof would be difficult since
terrorists, pedophiles and drug dealers can simply purchase or download
strong German, Swiss or Japanese encryption software that is freely
available all over the U.S. and the world--over 500 at last count.  If
necessary, criminals could even type in or scan one of the computer programs
printed in the many books published on the subject.  "compromise" schemes proposed so far addresses these First Amendment
problems.  And even the SAFE bill, which is well-intentioned, fails to
contain an assurance of judicial review of any agency decision to prevent
publication due to alleged national security concerns, a key element
required by the Constitution.  SAFE also does not clearly protect scientists
such as Professor Bernstein, but only protects those who seek to distribute
mass market software already available abroad.  This means that American
scientists can no longer participate in the ongoing international
development of this vital and important area of science.  technology violates the First Amendment because of what encryption does.
Encryption allows people to use electronic envelopes to protect their
speech.  The Supreme Court has noted that a state could not regulate ink or
paper without raising constitutional concerns.  We believe that similarly
the government cannot prevent Americans from using electronic envelopes or
require them to use key-escrowed envelopes without violating their First
Amendment rights.  This is because such rules compel them to speak to the
Government anytime they wish to speak to anyone else.  Encrypted speech is
still speech.  The elimination of privacy creates a chilling effect on that
speech which implicates the First Amendment.  Fathers used cryptography on a regular basis.  Even the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights themselves were often encoded, as Thomas Jefferson and James
Madison exchanged drafts of those seminal documents.   Cryptography was used
by a virtual Who's Who of the American Founding Fathers--not only Jefferson
and Madison but Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John and Abigail
Adams, Aaron Burr, and many others.  In sharp contrast to the
Administration's arguments today, they viewed cryptography as an  essential
instrument for protecting information, both political and personal.  Our
research indicates that when the First and  Fourth Amendments were enacted
in the late 1700s, any suggestion that the Government should have the
ability to prevent individuals from encrypting their messages, or that the
Government should have a back-door key to all encrypted messages, would have
struck the Constitution's framers as ridiculous.  software is succeeding.  It is succeeding because the First Amendment is
clearly violated when the government institutes a prepublication licensing
scheme which allows agency bureaucrats unfettered discretion to prevent
American scientists from publishing their own ideas.  It is succeeding
because the Courts have recognized the importance of keeping the First
Amendment intact as we move into the information age.  As you consider the
many legislative proposals about cryptography, we hope you will do the same.  Cindy A. Cohn, Cindy

For those who haven't yet heard,
Judge Gwin in the District Court in Ohio has granted the government summary
judgment in the Junger case.  Judge Gwin apparently agreed with the
government that the "functionality" of  encryption source code, and the
government's claims that it only intends to regulate that "functionality"
mean that the regulations are not "narrowly and directed at expressive
conduct" and so do not merit prior restraint analysis.  The Judge then held
that the regulations were content neutral, applied the intermediate scrutiny
tests and found that the export restrictions meet those tests.
I haven't had the opportunity to review the decision yet.  As soon as I
have, I will post some brief comments.

@_subject: No Subject 
Hi all,
I've now had a chance to review the decision in the Junger case.  I think it
contains many flaws, but will just highlight a few here.  The most striking thing about the opinion is how much the judge's willfully
ignored the undisputed factual record.   Plaintiffs submitted voluminous
declarations from programmers, computer science professors and others
confirming that they often communicate using source code.  The Declarants
included Professor Abelson of MIT, author of the key introductory textbook
of computer science, as well as Professor Appel from Princeton and several
prominent cryptographers and general computer scientists.  All of them
confirmed the need to read, write and share source code as part of their
work, and as part of the development of science.  They also testified to the
fact that many, many other people communicate using source code, and that
higher level languages are developed to allow humans to write, read and
develop each others ideas.  The Judge does quote the Supreme Court ruling that speech must be protected
by the First Amendment unless it is  "so far removed from any exposition of
ideas, and from truth,  *science,* morality, and arts in general . . . "
Yet despite these clear facts and despite the Supreme Court's clear
inclusion of scientific speech as protected expression,  Judge Gwin states:   1.  "encryption source code may *occasionally* be expressive (p.12)
2.   that in the "overwhelming majority of circumstances" encryption source
code is exported to transfer functions, not to communicate ideas."  (p.13)
 3.  "For the broad majority of persons receipting such source code, the
value comes from the function" (p.13-14).
4.   "encryption source code is rarely expressive"  (p. 15).
5.  "source code is conduct that can occasionally have communicative
elements."  (p.16)
6.  "Source code is a set of instructions to a computer that is *commonly*
distributed for the wholly non-expressive purpose of controlling a
computer's operation."  (page 17)
7.   "encryption software is not typically expression"  (page 18)
There are similar statements of fact throughout the decision, none of which
contain citations to anything in the record to support them.  So where is the evidence to support his conclusions?  The government
submitted no empirical studies of source code "exports"  from which one
could conclude how often source code is "expressive."  Certainly this is not
the kind of thing which can be judicially noticed.  At a minimum, the
declarations create a triable issue of material fact as to how often source
code is used to communicate ideas.  This alone should preclude summary
judgment.  Also, I know of know authority which holds that the number of people who
communicate in a given language is the basis on which we decide whether that
communication is speech.  Judge Gwin certainly cited none, but his opinion
assumes that this is relevant.  He also says that "certain software is inherently expressive" (page 13)
without stating what he thinks that kind of software is and how it differs
from encryption software.  The Junger team argued that the "functionality"
of encryption software, allowing privacy of speech, makes the software
subject to the First Amendment on its own, just as the regulations of
printing presses and newspaper racks violate the First Amendment even though
the item itself may not be speech.  The Judge ignored this argument
entirely.      Once the judge has decided that source code is not *sufficiently*
expressive, he ignores the settled analysis for prior restraints in order to
avoid applying the tests.  The easiest mistake to see is his reliance on the
9th Circuit Roulette decision for his holding that prior restraint review
shouldn't apply.  Roulette was *not* a prior restraint case.  It considered
an ordinance which allowed the police to arrest citizens for sitting on the
sidewalks.  In Roulette, a person didn't have to apply for a license to sit
on the sidewalks, he or she simply did it.  The question of whether the act
was expressive or not would always be reviewed by a Judge, as part of the
criminal process.  In the case of cryptography,in contrast,  one of the key
issues has been the fact that the cryptography regulations do not allow for
a judge to review agency decisions denying or requiring a license.  Thus,
applying Roulette as the standard to judge whether prior restraint analysis
applies is just plain wrong.  Having dispensed with prior restraint by relying on a non-prior restraint
case, the Court then considers overbreadth.   Again, he ignores the record
entirely.  He claims, again without any citation to the record,  that Junger
has failed to show that "the resulting injury to other academics is the very
same injury that Junger allegedly suffered."  But Junger included Declarations from people who were *not* academics who
have been injured by the export restrictions.  He included declarations from
Mr. Liebman (concerning some O'Reilly software) and Mr. Behlendorf
(concerning the Apache server) demonstrating that even those whose software
contains no encryption capability whatsoever have been injured by the
encryption regulations.  The record contains plenty of evidence that people
other than Junger, attempting to do different kinds of things than he does,
have suffered different kinds of injury due to the regulations.   Similarly,
Judge Gwin states that the regulations are not vague, ignoring the record
evidence that many, many people do not understand them and have been chilled
as a result.  Next, Judge Gwin finds content neutrality based upon the argument that
government is controlling the "functionality" of the software rather than
its content.  Acceptance of this phony distinction requires that a person
have no understanding of computer programming.  The content and the
functionality of a computer program are synonymous.  They have to be.  There
is no way to change or limit the functionality without also changing the
content of the source code.  To mandate key recovery is to mandate that
computer programs have different content than they would otherwise; its'
like saying that the government wants to control the "taste" of chocolate
cake rather than the recipe.  Change one, you must change the other.  Judge Gwin also relies on the fact that the Government allows "export" of
software on paper, thus defining "functionality" as based upon the fact that
source code can be converted into object code which can be run.   But this
analysis also ignores the existence of scanners and typists.  Software on
paper isn't any less "functional" than software in electronic form.   It
simply requires one more, simple, step to make it functional.  In the case
of the single page of source code which is Snuffle, in the Bernstein case,
the difference cannot be more than ten minutes worth of typing or a few
minutes to scan and correct errors prior to compiling.  *This* is the
difference our national security rests upon?
Judge Gwin then applies intermediate scrutiny, quickly finding that the test
is met.  In the end, Judge Gwin decided, despite the evidence, that source code isn't
often read by anyone and so shouldn't really deserve First Amendment
protection.  The rest of the analysis flows from there, with no regard for
the actual facts in the record.  The result is that we have a new category
of lesser protected expression, speech which is also "functional," without
any clear or understandable definition of the term "functional."  And all
those computer scientists and their settled methods of communicating with
each other apparently don't count when it comes to the First Amendment.
The larger ramifications of this holding, if it becomes law for the rest of
us, are frightening.  Taken to its extreme, this holding could be the
exception that swallows the rule of Reno v. ACLU.  If the fact that
something can "function" means it is not speech, every web page written in
HTML could be held not protected, since at some level each page is a
"functioning" computer program.  Certainly any web page or other electronic
publication which contains a Java applet is a "functioning" program. As I noted above, there are other criticisms which can be leveled as well.
These are simply a few that I've found so far.   Cindy Cindy A. Cohn, Cindy
