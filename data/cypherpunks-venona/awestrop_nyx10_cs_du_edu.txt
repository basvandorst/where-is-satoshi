You could telnet to nyx.cs.du.edu and set up an (optionally pseudonymous)
free account.  I've installed a perl script (posted to this list by George
Magiros) that automagically encrypts a user's incoming email by piping it
through pgp 2.6.2.  To use it, create a .forward file consisting of the line:
"| /nyx/user/bin/privacy "
This is far less effective than Sameer's c2 system, but it's simple enough
for net.novices to use.  You can retrieve your encrypted email via telnet,
ftp, or an offline mail reader that has hooks for pgp and works with mail
packets created by uqwk, which is also installed here.

Once again, we'll begin in the basement of the Tivoli, at downtown
Denver's Auraria Campus, and perhaps wander elsewhere.  Drop me a
note if you need directions or more info.

As usual, we'll begin at the Tivoli, near the downtown Auraria campus
(send email for directions).  Weather permitting, we'll have Yet Another
Demonstration of the Peripatetic Cypherpunks Protocol (patent pending),
visiting Lower Downtown's restaurants, saloons, libraries, the Tattered
Cover Bookstore, whatever...
