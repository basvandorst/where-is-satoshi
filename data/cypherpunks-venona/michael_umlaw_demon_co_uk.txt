 law, this sort of talk may have merit. At this stage, it's too
 strong.  So far the only declaration made is by one or more  Senators, not "the government".
 Sadly, the American Bar Association project that is writing model  legislation for this has been delayed.  A public discussion  draft, which should really move the ball forward, is not going  to happen until after our next meeting in August.  Expect  something published on the web in mid-September. Model  legislation is needed to sort out liability issues, for example,  without which large companies are afraid to enter the business.

AFAIK, neither Clipper nor Capstone have actually gotten export clearance yet.  No demand?  Fact that there were at last count no more than two beta versions of the decrypt processor in existence?  Or is my info just out of date....

                                                      ^^^^^^^ Very hard to argue that the right to write code (as opposed to, say, the right to write in code) existed in the late 18th century; hence it is hard to argue that it could be "retained" today.  Assuming that the ninth amendment has, or could have, teeth, it is unlikely to go beyond rights existing or closely analogous to those held by "the people" [free white males, more likely] at the time of the amendment's ratification.  Just as well if you think about it carefully.

Jim Ray asks what on earth I'm talking about the 9th amendment
not applying to the right to write code, since people were using codes to protect their communications long before the passage of the bill of rights.
I always understood "writing code" as in "cypherpuks write code" to mean computer code, that is FORTRAN, C++, assembler, perl or whatever.  I understand "writing IN code" to be the use of cryptographic tools such as codes or cyphers.  Thus my claim that the right to write IN code may have existed in the 1790s, but the right to write [computer] code could not (since there were no computers).   Of course, I could be wrong about this, since however you define it, it's debateable whether I'd pass the
code test to qualify as a cypherpunk, since I stopped writing code when I gave up programming for lawyering, and I didn't start writing in code when I started writing about codes.
In any case it's a matter of definitions, not timelines.
Note: I am not suggesting that the right to write code lacks constitutional protection; just that the protection wouldn't come from the 9th amendment.  My views on the constitutional right to write IN code, which also does not rely on the 9th amendment, can be found in my Clipper paper, which Hal Abelson has kindly ported in Netscape friendly form to:

As my final word on this thread, let me say that if you are really
interested in the 9th Amendment, by far the best legal article on the subject  that I know of is Charles L. Black, Jr, On Reading and Using the Ninth Amendment.   I have not visited the Cato web pages, but their journal tends to be on the shallow side.  I am far from LEXIS right now so I can't give you a citation for the Black article, but it is brilliant.  It would also make a libertarian's hair stand on end.  For hours.

Thank you for your useful survey.  May I make two comments about the US section?  First, many lawyers believe the ITAR to be unconstitutional as applied to some or all cryptographic algorithims and software; a court test is likely within the next few years.   Second, the American Bar Association Section on Science and Technology's Information Security Committee is drafting Guidelines and Model Legislation which, if they are ever completed, will improve upon the Utah initiative.  Meanwhile, other states, including California, are considering bills that are similar to Utah's.

Today's Guardian (uk) reports at page 4, column 2:
[I've edited this down]
       "Police move on Internet porn" By Owen Bowcott
       Vice squad officers from eight police forces yesterday took
part in an internationally-co-ordinated operation aimed at
suspected paedophiles who are alleged to have been exchanging
child pornography on the Internet.
       Nine people were arrested in early morning raids in the United Kingdom and a further 31 were detained elsewhere in her, America, the far east and South Africa.
       Codenamed Operation Starburst, the investigation follows growing concerns [about internet porn]  ...
       In the United Kingdom, 13 search warrants were executed ... Computer equipment was seized.  Those arrested were questioned but later released on bail.  [later the article reports 9 arrests and 17 computers seized]        The inquiry was prompted by officers in the West  Midlands police commercial vice unit who had identified several   Britons they believed were distributing child pornography on the Internet.  The Paedophile Unit and the National Criminal Intelligence Service made contact with overseas police forces to trace people suspected of  trading obscene pictures.
       [Detectives then quoted describing how "appalling" and "hard core" the pictures were, and saying that the "perverts were not making profits from the pictures" just trading them.]

It's probably bad for business if your bank gets a reputation as "check-bouncers-R-Us".   Knowing your customers may make it less likely they bounce checks; it certainly makes collecting (if you honor the check) much easier.
