The ITAR is U.S.-Law. This only applies (by definition) to US-citizens
or persons in the U.S.!
I think it's a common mistake of many Americans that they believe
creating law means creating law for the whole world!
It's inherent. You simply can't apply US-law to non-US-citizens outside
the U.S.!

I don't know the US-Export regulations very well, so please
allow a quick one:
Maybe a legal way around the keysize-regulation would be:
Many US companies have subsidiaries  outside the US.
Some of them are leaded by non-US-citizens.
1) The U.S.-company engineers a software with strong (but legal)    crypto for use inside the U.S. The program is sold in the U.S.
   At the same time the company exports the sourcecode of the
   program *without* any crypto at all to their subsidiaries.
   (should be legal)
2) one or more of the subsidiaries include "self-engineered"
   crypto-routines into the program-"hull" they received    from inside the U.S.
   This program is sold in th subsidiaries countries (Europe etc.) Two things have to be assured:
- Both crypto-routines have to be compatible
- No U.S.-citizens must be involved in the engineering of the   subsidiaries crypto-routines.
Any comments?
