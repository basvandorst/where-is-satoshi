@_subject: Camelot PRNG 
In the UK, the National Lottery is run by a company called Camelot (in case anyone didn't know)
A while back, they introduced a new option, in that if you checked a certain box on your ticket, 6 numbers would be 'chosen' for you, presumably 'randomly'
Does anyone have any info on how this system works?
i.e. The PRNG used? Whether the PRNG is in the shop terminal or at the central computer @ Camelot? et cetera.
(I am looking at the problems of PRSG for my Masters dissertation - hence the interest) Please reply either to the cypherpunks list or to my e-mail address if you think this doesn't have any crypto-relevance.
Thanks in advance...

@_subject: Norton Your Eyes Only 
I've just managed to get hold of a copy of this program. Does anyone
know what algorithms are used within the encryption/decryption parts of
the program or is it just an overgrown version of Norton's DISKREET?

@_subject: A source of entropy? 
Last weekend I spent time formatting a little over 100 new floppies. When I was staring at the monitor between changes, I started looking at the volume serial number that was being thrown up for each disk.
These *appeared* to be unpredictable from the previous serial number given.
If the serial number is represented as xxxx-yyyy then sometimes yyyy would be one less than the previous yyyy but xxxx always seemed to be The disks were all brand new, no errors (from a couple of boxes of 50 and some odd ones), formatted at the Win95 DOS prompt with 'format a: /u' no volume labels and pressing 'y' to format the next disk.
Would anyone like to comment on the possible entropy from these serial numbers, even if it's only to say "Don't be daft, DOS derives the numbers like this..."
I'll probably be doing a similar number next weekend. If any interest is generated from this post, I could always record the serial numbers given to the next batch to look for correlations.
(Please don't reply with 'invest in a bulk-formatter' - I can't afford one right now.)
