But what also is realy anoying, when I get through I only get 3 keyspaces,
even though I request 16.  I can understand the limit probably caused
by the guy yesterday who requested 50000 keyspaces 1f-something to
ce-something, but I think 3 is way to low.
I and a coworker have 4 pentiums (not much compared to some of you) but they
are idleing most of the time...
Yeah.. whats up?

Im interested too... if there is a 32 bit client for NT/Win95 (or a single
thredded one for Win32s) capable of reporting automatic to the
server/local server, I could probably throw in c.a. 40-50 pentiums and a
lot more 486 (and a few HP/Sun/Alpha) :-)  Anyone working on self-reporting
win32 client?
