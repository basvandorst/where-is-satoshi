This technique has been discussed before.  It will not work because
the 40-bit export version of SSL actually uses 128 bit keys, with 88 of
the bits transfered in the clear.  The extra 88-bits act as a "salt" to
the key.  This defeats attempts to do a single key space search for multiple messages.

You can find some documents about s/mime on RSA's web site:
S/MIME is basicly a mime body enveloped in a PKCS7 message.  You can
find out more about PKCS from:
The implementation guide recommends using rc2-cbc 40-bit for content
encryption when there is no way to determine the capabilities of the
recipient.  When you do know what the recipient can do, it recommends
using RC2-CBC with a longer key or DES-CBC.
For key encryption support for RSA with key sizes of 512 to 1024 is
required, and support for 2048 bit keys is recommended.  A minimum
key size of 768 bits is recommended for US users.

@_subject: Re: netscape's response 
DISCLAIMER: my comments below are my opinion, and not necessarily the
position of Netscape.
  Yes, it was < 1 minute if you had captured the client-hello message,
and had access to the machine that was running the Navigator, and it
was a unix machine and it was not an SGI with a high-resolution timer.
  If the attacker does not have access to the machine to determine the
pid and ppid, then the attack will take longer.  If the Navigator
is running on an SGI machine with a high resolution cycle counter then
it is used as the first of the two 32bit seeds.
  If the Navigator is running on a Mac or PC, then the two seeds are
the current time and the "tick count", which is milliseconds since starting
windows for the PC version, and some time unit since booting on the Mac.
  I believe that it would take much longer than 1 minute to mount an
attack against a mac, pc, or unix machine that the attacker was not
logged on to.  I don't know exactly how the few hour number was
calculated, since it was done by marketing with input from someone else
in the group.  Another interesting data point is that the unix version,
which was most vulnerable, accounts for less than 10% of our user
base, according to the yahoo random link stats.
  Of course none of this reduces the magnitude of the screw up/bug/design
flaw/whatever.  I really can't say which of these it was since I wasn't
around at the time that this code was being written.  I must admit that
the RNG seed code was not an area that I thought to examine when I took
over our security library.
  This was a bad mistake on our part, and we are working hard to fix it.
We have been trying to identify sources of random bits on PCs, Macs, and
all of the many unix platforms we support.  We are looking at stuff that
is system dependent, user dependent, hardware dependent, random external
sources such as the network and the user.  If anyone has specific
suggestions I would love to hear them so that we can do a better job.
  Do you mean that cypherpunks offered to review the netscape code
if only we made all the source available on the net?  I think that it
is unrealistic to expect us to release all of our source code to the
net.    We will be having at least some of our code reviewed by a
wider audience, but I don't yet know which code, or how wide a review
group.  If anyone has specific suggestions for pieces of code that
you would like to see widely reviewed (such as RNG and seed generation)
let me know.
  I realize that some cypherpunks think that we should make all of
our code publicly available.  In an ideal world that would be great,
but we live in a world with politicians, crooks, lawyers, stockholders,
etc...  Don't expect to see us posting our entire security
library source code to cypherpunks.
  I would love to hear your suggestions for good sources of entropy
on any systems that our products run on.
  Is this offer good for netscape employees?  What if I post the code
without having had to decompile it?   :-)

  On windows and mac the first 32bit seed is seconds since 1970, and the
second 32bit seed is the "tick count", which I'm told is the number of
milliseconds since windows started.

. >is still not permitted by U.S. law, U.S. customers of Netscape Navigator,
  We are also examining some sort of binary patch technology, so that
folks with the US-only version can easily download and apply the patch.
  I think that the general opinion of engineers and management here at
Netscape is that it would be A Really Good Thing to have our US-only
128+ bit version of Netscape Navigator available for download by US
citizens and others who are not legally prohibited from using it.
  As a matter of fact, up until the RNG thing hit on sunday night, I
had been making myself a major pain in the ass to netscape managers
and executive, bugging them every day for at least the past several
weeks, to get a decision about making the US version available for
free download.
  I know that MIT, RSA, and others make crypto code available for
download with various mechanism.  I'm sure that these institutions
did not make the decision lightly.  This issue is now a very high
priority for our lawyers, but it will take some time for them to
reach a legal opinion about Netscape's legal exposure.  The fact that
MIT and RSA have done it does not mean that the government will not
go after Netscape for similar behavior.  We all know what a juicy
target Netscape is these days...  :-)
  We have submitted our proposal for download checking to the State Dept.
I think that our process does more validation than what others have done.
The State Dept. has so far refused to send us any kind of written approval
of our proposed methods.  I know that many of you think that this is
futile, and I won't dispute that, but I think we do have to make the
effort in order for our case to hold up later.
  We do share your frustration at being forced to use weak crypto.
This has been a major pain for us, but I believe that we are committed
to continuing to produce a version with strong crypto (as long as it
remains legal - sigh).
  I for one will always fight to ensure that we have a version of
our Navigator that supports "strong" crypto, and to make that version
easily and widely available.  The governments attempts to get
companies to produce watered down versions for the US because it is
easier will not succeed here as long as I have any say in the matter.
Also, the company has taken a vocal public position against the
current ITAR restrictions and any sort of mandatory or government
controlled key escrow.

You are making a lot of assumptions here.  Lets say that the browser
software is allowing certificate chaining (browser traverses certificate
issuers until it finds one it trusts, then accepts the entire chain).
There could be an attribute in the certificate that indicates whether
the issuer is certifying it to be a subordinate CA.  Presumably when
Moriarty signs a persona certificate, it does not have this attribute.
  X509 version 3 does support arbitrary extensions.  We are making use of
this feature in Netscape Navigator 2.0.  Giving certificates attributes
such as "how was their identity verified" and "what operations are they
certified for" is an obvious application of this.

While I agree that we should probably truncate this string to something
smaller than 10000 characters(I've already filed a bug on it here), it
is perfectly legal X protocol to send 10,000 characters to the X server.
How do I decide what is too long?  For example, when tracking down buffer
overflow problems for the security patch, we found an undocumented
static buffer limit of 64 bytes for the hostname passed to gethostbyname()
on IRIX.  Before we stumbled across this problem, we had a discussion
about what length we should truncate host names to.  People thought
that 128 characters was a reasonable limit, but it turned out that it
was too long.
  If the X server crash is what I think it is, it could still be hit
if we limit the string length, depending on the user's font selections
in their .Xdefaults.
  The fact is that if we are passing documented legal values into X,
unix, windows, or some other system software, we may still tickle
some bug in the system.  We can't test against every patch level of
every piece of software that our code may run against.  If that code
crashes its a bug in that code, and there is little we can do about
it other than try to play by the documented rules.
  That said, there are probably still bugs in Netscape that will
cause it to crash.  We took care to try to find all such bugs that
occured on the stack, which could be used to insert code and
jump to it.  That was the best we could do in the timeframe of
the security patch.  For 2.0 we are doing complete code reviews
to look for any sort of overflows, stack or not, as well as other
latent bugs.  We are also beefing up our QA to try to find more
of these types of bugs.
