For Lists That Care About Computer Privacy:
In case you didn't catch this elsewheres..  I've been covering the
SJG vs. SS trial for certain magazines.  Hopefully you'll be able
to read soon an in-depth, first hand account of the fiasco our paid officials attempted to conduct during the SS trial.
The bueno news is that individuals and small companies can actually sue the US Fed govt for privacy violations, and win.
Judge Sparks didn't give a whole lot of airplay to the *damages*
sustained, but this is an important step forward.  The flood gates are opened..

One alternative would be to use the technology within its
own narrative..
If IP providers and other sysops are *annoyed* that an anonymous remailer passes "untraceable" email, why not
have a remailer that passes email with a trail of
encrypted SASE ??
That way, the identity of the person posting is preserved,
albeit not the physical location..

"Sent from the cyberdeck of: Geoff White"
Our company, FringeWare, has been out doing brain machine demos at
raves for a while..  I'm still trying to catch up on sleep from last
weekend's rave construction & show :-)
The raves started as socio/politial but in many places have become Even so, sentiments are in the right place, guaranteed.  Especially
among the *RAVE PROMOTERS* ..  The promoters are already sensitive to
issues in common with cypherpunks since they tend to be underground
operations in the cash economy, etc.  Plus, they're HEAVILY networked.
As a techno/gonzo journalist, I've found it EASIER to get in with hacker
cliques than with rave promoter cliques; granted the real stakes are higher so they take security more seriously :-)
Also, I'm intrigued to see the overlap (at least in this area) between
ravers and people at EFF-Austin mtgs..  Some of the main u/g promoters
even showed up to EFF-A's CopCon a couple weeks back, so the overlap
in our agendas is valid.
I'd tend to go with the argument that actually signing keys or passing
out pamphlets during a rave would be weird and blow the mood.  Maybe you'd
say "So what?" but to an entertainment promoter, mood means everything and only a few cypherphuckups would spread a terrible image for us.  I'm
generally the most hi-tech part of these raves, what with the sound/light
brain gizmos and even that's too left-brained some ravers..  Most want to
experience, not engage in discourse.  With pheromones and alkaloids
being some of the dominant attractions for people attending, I could
agree more :-)
Which is why I'd suggest we tag along with the VRrave project, based on
IRC connex between concurrent raves.  That'd present a hi-tech set & setting and allow for some demo/experience of secure comm.  Do what you can to introduce/instruct the local promoters -- but generally they're busy people with better things to worry about, like
liability and overhead not somebody else's political agenda.

"Sent from the cyberdeck of: peter honeyman"
Hear, hear from another former Bell Labbie MTS..  (of course, we
were in Network Support and used to have our _vendors_ call back
collect if we knew they used Sprint, because the sound was so
much better :-)
AT&T *does* have a lot of twisted stockholder proposals. They also have more "ma & pa" individual investors than most large firms, as opposed to VC & institutional votes, so the mgt feels VERY sensitive toward shareholder votes. That's the price a firm
must pay for cutting a regular dividend for N decades..  In fact,
the mgt is so sensitive that they even have a near-mandatory
payroll deduction program for employees to support their PAC.
Really fucked!
All it takes is just one share and you can propose an item for
vote, but I think you need many more shareholders to join in
before the vote will get anywhere near the proxy ballot. You can bet that AT&T mgt will do everything they can to discredit
and/or block any vote they haven't initiated themselves.
Even so, we researched this form of "protest" as a much more
effective alternative to "boycotts" (which are frankly impossible
in a post-industrial economy anyways) during the piss-test
conflict at . Any brokers or VC's here, ie. field experts?
Twas part of my "12-Step Program To Kill Corporate Drug Testing" published recently in Urine Nation News. The other corporate
juggler vein to swat with a machete is to approach to a firm's
first/second tier customers and find a neato way to give them the shivers about the firm's offensive programs.. Like Apple wasn't exactly pleased when  started mumbling about insuring that all its biz partners enforced drug testing as well so that they could chalk up even more Malcum Balddick awards from the Republicans..
Mind you that AT&T earns its lunch money from corp & govt work
combined with legislative tax breaks, not so much from Jane R.
Consumer..  If there was anyway to make AT&T's corp/govt customers paranoid about the Wiretap chip (as they well should
be!) then AT&T might reconsider - quickly!!  It's happened
Let's see, who among AT&T's bevy of cash cows might have a lil'
sumthin' to fear from having their secure comm tapped by the
Feds..  Let's see, how about mainland China?  Or possibly Mobile
Oil?  Let's apply the leverage where it will ouch the most..
