@_subject: Re: Java Crypto API questions 
When Microsoft announced their crypto API, they also announced that their signatures on crypto modules would be export-restricted.  According to e-mail I received from a Microsoft employee on the project, the act of signing was considered a "defense service" under ITAR, so exporting the signature would somehow be performing defense services for foreign persons.  It makes slightly less sense to me than the rest of the crypto export restrictions do, but I guess that's the deal that Microsoft worked out with the Feds in order to be allowed to do a crypto API at all.
