As we guessed XS4ALL don`t even have the guts to send us a copy of the pages they censored. Check this out...

Plz forward this to the cypherpunk list:
The simple reason that a copy cannot be sent is that we have no such
copy. The Dutch police have asked us to remove these pages, because
they where being used to sell and distribute marihuana, hashish and
XTC. These drugs had been distributed to countries like France,
England and Japan. Through Interpol these countries had requested the
dutch police to take action against these pages. If Xs4all would not
have removed the pages we'd have been target of a criminal
Kind regards,

@_subject: List problems or is it quiet??? 
I have checked the cypherpunks archive following my comment that I was not getting much mail from the list (only 8 to 10 posts per day) over the last 2 or 3 days, and the archive confirms this. Igor and Jim have confirmed that algebra and ssz are up, and cyberpass is reponding to majordomo requests...
I`m just sending this to check that this really is not a list problem, as of course 10 posts a day is an uncommonly low traffic level for the list.
Unless of course the black clad ninja`s have come round on 4am nomex hooded raids, and you are all in the ministry of love being questioned over allegations of thoughtcrime, which would explain the lack of posts         Datacomms Technologies data security

@_subject: Censored pages 
Message to prolife alliance, CCd to Cypherpunks list:
I noticed an article in .net a few days ago detailing how the prolife alliance, a UK anti-abortion group, had been required to remove images of aborted foetuses  from their web site. Clearly this is another incident of jackbooted motherfuckers censoring images that happen to contradict their particular brand of thuggery. I am sending this message to the prolife alliance to ask them to send a .zip or .tar`d file of their pages to me along with the censored images, I am also of course CCing this to cypherpunks to see if anyone out there not in the UK is also interested in mirroring these pages, if so send me email, or send direct to prolife who will, hopefully, provide us with a copy of these pages.
Note please cypherpunks that if there is any thread I do not wish to start it is a pro/anti abortion thread, therefore, I am making no judgements whatsoever, merely suggesting action to prevent censorship...
