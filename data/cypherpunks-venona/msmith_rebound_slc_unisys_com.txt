Actually, I've been thinking about this, and how do we *really* know that
*anyone's* keys are actually theirs?  I'm new to this list and have been collecting some of the keys from people who post with PGP signatures, but even at that, I never certify them myself because I am not 100% absolutely
certain that the key in question belongs to that person.  After all, what
if some clever hacker dropped in and replaced someone's .plan file, or edited their index.html file?  There's no real way to be absolutely How certain are we that the keyservers are 100% bulletproof?  Hell, I could call Joe Schmoe up and say "tell me your fingerprint", but how do I *really* know I'm talking to Joe unless I knew him before getting his signature?  Just some thoughts about some of the basic flaws in this sort of system.  BTW, I collect the signatures because I have a patched version of Elm which
goes out and automatically tries to verify all PGP signed messages, and it's kind of annoying when it can't find the signature (all sorts of junk
goes sprawling up my screen).

Well, that's how they busted the Amateur Action BBS from what I remember.  Basically they mail you the porno, arrest you as soon as you pick up the box, and then that gives them probably cause to get a warrant to rip apart your
computer and charge you with other things.  The charges that were filed against Robert Thomas (sysop of the AA BBS) for picking up that box were
eventually cleared, but he was convicted of other charges apparently. So it's more used as a tool to find other charges.  Those charges are eventually dropped.

The problem is entering this "Web of trust".  You have to know someone who
is already in The Web in order to start signing your keys.  I don't know
anyone around here who uses PGP but me.  That's why I've been getting
keys off of this list.  Gotta start somewhere, however, I feel that this is a very shaky way to start.
I agree that once the WOT is set up, everything should work hunky dory, but
introducing yourself into this web isn't an easy thing.  Since we know that
the keyservers aren't bulletproof, how many keys do I grab from there in order to start my keyring?  One?  Ten?  500?  Statistically speaking, how many of those have been compromised and can no longer be trusted?
That's what I'm trying to do.  Maybe I'm just looking at it all backwards or something, but it's something I've been thinking about since I've been collecting keys lately.

@_subject: distributed keys 
Has anyone heard of an algorithm for managing keys automatically in a distributed system?  For instance, if some low level security were to be implemented in a
a networking stack where authentication was to be implemented, you would want
to have each node have it's own signature so that signature checking can take place when one node connects to another node.  The trick is then getting every node's keys distributed to every other node.
Here are some ideas that I had, but neither is very desireable:
-  Manual distribution.  User configures every node's key into every node.
   Configuration becomes a major hassle and mistakes are a pain to debug.
   An advantagous side effect is the user can configure which machines can    talk to which machines if they're feeling particularly facist.
-  At connection time, each node determines whether or not it has the other
   node's key.  If not, a symmetric key is generated via DH and public keys
   are exchanged.  The problem comes in if someone is spoofing the machine
   to begin with.  Then you'll have the wrong public key.  Chicken, egg.     Egg, chicken.  -  Having a certifying node which every other node has the public key to and
   who has everyone else's public key.  Requests are made of this server.     The trick is making this server secure and forcing the user to devote
   resources to this endeavour.
