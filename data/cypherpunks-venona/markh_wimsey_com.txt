If you are in the U.S. or Canada you can get the unexpurgated version
from ftp.wimsey.bc.ca:
- -rw-r--r--   1 markh    user       28214 Mar 01 14:23 fips181.txt.gz
- -rw-r--r--   1 markh    user       28184 Apr 14 14:40 word.c.gz
get the following two files.
word.c is a version that actually compiles. The original code in FIPS 181 needed a few cosmetic changes to actually compile correctly.
(usual mechanism with the XXXXXXXX, cd /pub/crypto/software and get
the file README. If you agree to the terms, follow the instructions)
