@_subject: Hiding strings in objects code 
I'm looking for a way of concealing the text strings in an object file
so that they can't be seen. I'd like to use something a little more
complicated than rot13 :-), but something that's freely usable for
non-profit use.
Any suggestions as to which I should use ?

From David Harvey's list of places holding pgp outside the us:
  ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/security/virus/crypt/pgp
where, physically, is this machine (country).

It seems a little strange that cypherpunks are arguing over whether or
not to disclose information about a (supposedly) cryptographic product
to a certain individual.
  Let's relate this this to other examples of restricting cryptographic
information - can anyone think of any groups or organisations that do
this ? Okay, now we've thought of a couple, lets compare reasons
(left as exercise for the reader) for the restriction of this
information and our opinions on those restrictions.
  Have I made my point ? Should we change the infamous slogan to:
"Cyperpunks is watching you". Someone asked a techical question about
cryptography, other list members answered it.
  Can we now get on with more relevant matter ?

or that liberty is it's own enemy. One individual's concept of liberty
may infringe on anothers to the point where one individual feels
restricted by the other. The discussion could go on for hours.
My point was not that breaking into your girlfriend's files because you
haven't got the guts to ask her something directly is somehow
acceptable, personally I think it isn't acceptable. My point was that
the list adopted the position of censor in deciding whether or not to
'release' information to the enquirer. That is what I disagree with.
The 'I should be able to read her files in case she's cheating on me'
argument is only a matter of steps away from the 'I should be able to
tap her phone in case she's cheating on me'.
I can't remember the former, and I can't associate with the latter, so I
won't comment ;-)
This is terribly off-topic. Responses by email - no more waste of list
bandwidth please.
