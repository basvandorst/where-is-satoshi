I'm looking for pointers, or perhaps an explanation of the statement
I found in Applied Cryptography (section 9.6) where it implies
that if the IV is not unique in CFB mode, the cryptanalyst can recover the
The reason that this interests me is that I have a file, encrypted
with DES in CFB mode. I believe I know the first 8 bytes of plaintext
and I also know the IV used. While it'd be nice to decrypt this
file, I don't know that it'd be worth brute forcing the key, even if
the spare cycles to do it were available. Any pointers to any pertinant
information would be appreciated. Thanks.

1) Usually more net connected hosts.
2) Lack of adequate sysadmin attention/knowlege.
3) Vague and poorly enforced site security policies.
This is of course a generalization, but corporations seem to
have more money and time to throw at security. On the other hand, it's common at Universities to get a new Sun/SGI/whatever,
hook it to the net, and run it without spending a lot of time
configuring it. Just because a University has a CS department doesn't mean that it
is more secure. Even if security is an area of study, it doesn't
mean that other departments benefit from the research.
I don't know what University sites you're referring to, my experience
has been that on the average, .edu sites are less secure than .com

I'll have to keep an eye on my machine, I think it may be subversive.

That the key belongs to the person(s) assuming the identity of
"Toxic Avenger". When someone signs my key, they are saying that
they believe that the key belongs to me, a person who has the
identity of "Kevin Prigge". Since I am a real person, I can prove that some other entity knows me as Kevin Prigge via some form
of identification issued by the state, and I can prove that I control the key. For a 'nym, there is no identification that is
issued, which may be the point of having an 'nym. The best that
can be said is that the user posting with a 'nym of
"whatever" controls the key, which is all I'd be certifying with
my signature on the key.

Not really. I think the governments position has been 64 bits with

88 bits escrowed, as I believe the government has stated in the
past that they don't want to give away the store even with escrow.
