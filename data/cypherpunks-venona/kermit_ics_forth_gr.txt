In soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks/applications/link there is a server
 for encrypted login on slip connections between Unix and amiga. Could the
 author please contact me ? I'm rewriting some of the code to make a simple
 telnetd with RSA/tripple DES encryption. My apologies to those with no interest to the subject, but Eric told me i could
 find the person i seek through the list (preferable answer by email).

Has anyone (other than me that is :) thought of changing just the
 library routines for setsockopt/getsockopt/send/recv ?
 It wouldnt be too hard (me thinks) to do it, but i dont know where to
 find the sockets library.
