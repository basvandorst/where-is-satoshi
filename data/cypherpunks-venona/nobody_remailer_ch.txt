SKIPJACK Review
                               Interim Report
                           The SKIPJACK Algorithm

                             Executive Summary
   The objective of the SKIPJACK review was to provide a mechanism
   whereby persons outside the government could evaluate the strength of
   the classified encryption algorithm used in the escrowed encryption
   devices and publicly report their findings. Because SKIPJACK is but
   one component of a large, complex system, and because the security of
   communications encrypted with SKIPJACK depends on the security of the
   system as a whole, the review was extended to encompass other
   components of the system. The purpose of this Interim Report is to
   report on our evaluation of the SKIPJACK algorithm. A later Final
   Report will address the broader system issues.
       We examined the internal structure of SKIPJACK to determine its
       susceptibility to differential cryptanalysis. We concluded it was
       not possible to perform an attack based on differential
       cryptanalysis in less time than with exhaustive search.
       SKIPJACK algorithm is classified SECRET NOT RELEASABLE TO FOREIGN
       NATIONALS. This classification reflects the high quality of the
       algorithm, i.e., it incorporates design techniques that are
       representative of algorithms used to protect classified
       information. Disclosure of the algorithm would permit analysis
       that could result in discovery of these classified design
       techniques, and this would be detrimental to national security.
       However, while full exposure of the internal details of SKIPJACK
       would jeopardize law enforcement and national security objectives,
       it would not jeopardize the security of encrypted communications.
       This is because a shortcut attack is not feasible even with full
       knowledge of the algorithm. Indeed, our analysis of the
       susceptibility of SKIPJACK to a brute force or shortcut attack was
       based on the assumption that the algorithm was known.
       Conclusion 3: While the internal structure of SKIPJACK must be
       classified in order to protect law enforcement and national
       security objectives, the strength of SKIPJACK against a
       cryptanalytic attack does not depend on the secrecy of the
       algorithm.

SonntagsZeitung Online, July 12, 1998:
The movement profiles do exist
A confidential report by the data protection commissioner unveils:
Swisscom collects the complete Natel cell phone data every three hours
BY NIKLAUS RAMSEYER AND DENIS VON BURG
BERNE - a secret report by data protection commissioner Odilo Guntern
proves: Swisscom locates all powered-on Natel phones in Switzerland
with an accuracy of 100 meters every three hours and stores these data
for seven days.
Things are not as bad as all that, it's all legal, and there's no
problem whatsoever, the Swiss federal data protection commissioner
Odilo Guntern appeased the public last Monday. Swisscom AG apparantly
has "the possibility of locating every powered-on Natel at any time",
he admitted. That however only within the so-called Location Areas
comprising of 50 kilometers each - and certainly not down to the 2,500
a few kilometers small radio cells in the country "as claimed by the
SonntagsZeitung", Guntern said.
What the public did not learn: Gunterns lean three-page paper is only
the tip of the iceberg. Hidden behind it there is a 30 pages long
secret report that Guntern delivered only to "the parties involved",
as he calls it. "Involved" are Swisscom, Leuenberger's
(communications) and Koller's (justice and police) departments and the
parliament's revisions delegation.
Gunterns confidential report not only contains the crucial information
to the Natel issue. It partly contradicts the public remarks and to a
large extent confirms the SonntagsZeitung article of 28 December
1997. In particular Guntern concealed that the 800,000 Natel users in
Switzerland can not only "be located", but are subject to a fully
automatted Periodic Location Updating (PLU). PLU means: Every active
Natel will announce itself to the closest antenna every three hours,
then Swisscom will register its location.
Each Natel owner can verify that himself: It is sufficient to put the
switched-on mobile telephone next to a transistor radio. It then will
emit a clearly audible galloping crackle.
Movement data in some cases are stored for many weeks
The location information covers not only "one of only 30 location
areas" in the country, as Guntern wanted to make believe, it descends
down to "radio cell level". In cities it has a precision of a few 100
meters - in open rural areas still a precision of max. 10
kilometers. At least that is what experts from a leading Natel company
assure. Thus the quite precise Natel location is registered every
three hours. Worse yet: Swisscom stores the cell phones' corresponding
"movement data" for seven days - in some cases even for weeks and
SVP member of parliament Bernhard Seiler, who is president of the
parliament's GPK delegation, confirms these facts to the
SonntagsZeitung. Data Protection commissioner Odilo Guntern too
admits: "The subject PLU is discussed in detail in my report." He will
not talk about "technical details" however.
It is quick to calculate. Eight location reports from 800,000 cell
phones per day, stored for one week: Swisscom permanently has more
that 40 million data available on where and how the 800,000 Natels are
moving through the country. They only serve for making connections, is
said officially. But whoever has access to this information can
immediately print out a "movement profile" and learn where exactly the
Natel (and thus, its owner) has been during the past seven
days. Guntern: "That is not impossible." Using radiogoniometics (see
graphics) Swisscom can even locate each Natel to an exactness of 50
meters and tap the conversations.
That also applies to the controversial Natel D Easy: "we have movement
data and operational data for these devices as well", Odilo Guntern
assures. That explains why the Conferedate Justice and Police
Department and Federal Attorney General Carla Del Ponte demand that
buyers of such devices should be registered systematically. If
necessary the police would like to know whom the movement profile of a
given Natels belongs to.
And why did the Guntern report remain secret? The "parties involved"
blame each other for the secretiveness. Guntern: "I didn't even ask
them if they would like to publish the report, and decided myself that
it was not public."
The controlling authorities at the Swiss parliament are not going to
accept that: "We were of the opinion that the entire Guntern report
would be presented in public", says the SP deputy Werner Carobbio from
Tessin, who also is a member of the GPK delegation. "We will bring up
the issue of "movement profiles of Natel users" for deepened
discussion", he promises.
Les Temps Online, July 7, 1998:
TELECOMS. Yesterday the federal data protection commissioner presented his
annual report
Odilo Guntern: "Natel owners must be able to remain anonymous"
By Gabriel Sigrist
In Switzerland, every citizen can walk into a store and acquire a
smard part to be inserted into a portable telephone for 120
francs. Swisscom's system Natel D Easy does not require any
subscription and thus the user can remain anonymous. This anonymity
disturbs the Attorney General of the Confederation, Carla Del Ponte,
who on several occasions set her face against a system "used by all
the criminals". According to the department of public prosecution, the
new ordinance on telecommunications imposed identification of Natel D
easy users beginning January 1st. The federal data protection
commissioner's report completely contradicts this assertion. "There is
no legal base for keeping records of Natel easy customers", Odilo
Guntern concludes in his annual report. The data protection
commissioner goes even further: "In our society, protection of the
individual requires the possibility to talk on the phone without being
recorded in files, he stated towards Les Temps. Record the purchasers
of "easy" cards does not make sense because the criminals use other
means to remain anonymous, such as foreign cards but also call-back
services or simply phone booths." In the neighbour countries however
the purchasers of such cards must declare their identity. "It is
because the laws are different, explains Odilo Guntern. In
Switzerland, identification is obligatory only when there is a
long-term customer provider relation, which is not the case with
pre-paid cards." The card easy is thus legally comparable to a CFF
multicourse subscription or a phone card to use in booths. Goods which
can be acquired anonymously.
However the debate is not closed: "In our opinion the legal base is
sufficient to impose registration of the users, explains Jürg Blaser,
spokesman of the department of public prosecution. It is essential for
the security of our country to be able to identify the holders of
portable telephones." The federal Office of communications (Ofcom)
will decide. According to Odilo Guntern, it currently remains
"perfectly legal" to acquire a card easy without giving your
name. Swisscom however encourages the purchasers to identify
themselves: the operator offers a small gift to those who reveal their
personal data.
The comissioner also occupied himself with in the possibilities of
tracing mobile telephones. According to his report, Swisscom can
locate a simply powered-on portable in a relatively large zone, but
not to the cell (a circle of ten kilometers). There too, opinions
According to Christian Masson, enthusiastic activist of the freedom of
circulation, the GSM system used by Swisscom's Natel stores the
precise localization of the devices every three hours, for maintenance
purposes. Odilo Guntern does not mention such a process in his
report. According to Swisscom, the users' positions are erased
during their movement.
The report also puts emphasis on customer fidelity cards such as the
M-Cumulus by Migros. "Any holder of such a card must be informed of
the various discounts of which he can profit, as well as of the data
processing relating to it", indicates the report.

Well, kind of. If some public figure comes up before the nation and says
quietly "I did not have sex with Brenda the Barber," that's one thing. If the same public figure goes under oath and then lies, it's another. In
the first case, he's exercising freedom of speech, though there could be
some argument as to whether somebody in a public office has the right to
lie like that. In the second case, he's trying to throw a wrench in the
justice system. It wouldn't be as bad if somebody like Jim or I lied under
oath, but this guy is the chief executive of the United States. He's
basically Top Cop, and his administration doesn't hesitate to press
charges against people who commit all sorts of victimless crimes.

By default. The machine boots. It is either told to accept a passphrase or
is told nothing. If the latter, it boots normally, only with its HD-hiding
code. If the former, it prompts, accepts a passphrase, and then boots
normally, only with the HD-hiding code disabled.
What I think you're asking is how the actual cryptography would be done. I
wouldn't want to stick crypto code in the BIOS, or at least not the code
which will be used all the time. I think a better way to do this is to have the BIOS boot up in HD-hiding
mode all the time, and require user-mode software to disable HD-hiding
mode and then deal with the cryptography.
You don't, at least not at first. If you hold down maybe the left and
right shift keys, in combination with the left alt key while pressing the
"R" key, it prompts "BIOS: ". You type your passphrase in. LILO (the LInux
LOader) does this if you depress a shift key during boot. Obviously with
LILO it's to specify kernel parameters, what OS to boot into, and things
like that.

@_subject: Re: Jury duty considered harmful, or at least rare 
That is almost enough to make the more paranoid among us think that maybe
they have a "do not summon" list. They basically have this anyway with the
prosecution vetoing possible jurors. If you're on it, you just aren't
summoned. People on that list would be people of libertarian mindsets,
politically outspoken people, Cypherpunks, professional people, etc.
If they do have a list, I'd kind of like to be on it. I'm a college
student, and I _can't_ serve on a jury for more than a day or so. The same
goes for doctors, corporate executives, and others.
There is an inherent flaw in the jury system. You get summoned and are
legally required to blow the entire day down at the courthouse. If you're
a student you miss classes, and if you have a job you miss that too. You
have to pay for transportation, parking, food, and whatever else you need. In return, you get paid something like $3, which often isn't even enough
to cover the parking and get told every five minutes that this or that
will get you, as a juror or potential juror, thrown in jail.
Meanwhile, if you're a doctor, scientist, college student, lawyer, or hold
any other professional position you're thrown off most of the time. If you
have a decent job or if you're in school, forget about it, because if
you're tied up for more than a day or so you _just can't do it_. They
don't want people who know that juries are capable of nullification. They
don't want people who can determine that the evidence of one side or the
other is suspect. They don't want people who will actually look at the
facts rather than the emotion of the opening and closing arguments. The
prosecution sure as hell doesn't want anybody who will look at whether a
law should exist in the first place.
"Hey, Doctor! Um, I have to serve on a jury. Can you take all my patients
for the next six months while I'm locked in a hotel room? Oh, and I need
to still get my full salary to pay my bills. Thanks, buddy." Um, no.
So you basically wind up with juries which are stacked with welfare
recipients, stupid people, and retirees. A jury of retirees may work, but
the others surely don't.
When the trial actually starts, the average juror, regardless of what
council may tell them about due process, is usually biased in favor of the
prosecution, especially if the government is claiming that the defendant
is an evil child molestor. If it's a case involving technology, you get a
bunch of bogus "experts" up there which say what council wants to be said,
because real "experts" refuse to dumb down their testimony to a
kindergarden level.
"Mr. May, will you please explain -- in layman's terms -- exactly how the
microchip fabrication process works?"
"Well, we start with..." "I'm sorry to stop you, sir. Can you please explain to the jury -- in
layman's terms -- what a transistor is?" "Well, in this context it often acts as a switch for an electronic
circuit, but it can also--"
"Would you please explain in layman's terms what a circuit is?" Argh. Can you imagine trying to be a defense expert in a cryptography case with
a bunch of jurors who can barely read, are unemployed, hate "nerds," and
beat the "geeks" up in high school, while the prosecution is constantly
screaming that the defendant is a kiddy porn trader and you're expected to
dumb your expert testimony down to kindergarden level?

A new report on national security, titled "CyberCrime, CyberTerrorism and
CyberWarfare," calls for a complete overhaul of U.S. national security
agencies and policies in order to avoid crippling sabotage of the nation's
and corporate America's information infrastructure.  The report, which is
the product of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Global
Organized Crime project headed up by former FBI and CIA director William
Webster, chronicles the results of a recent joint chief of staff exercise
code-named "Eligible Receiver."  The exercise involved a group of security
experts, known as a "red team," that used software widely available from
cracker Web sites to demonstrate the capability to penetrate and disable
major portions of the U.S. electric power grid and deny computer systems to
the entire Pacific military command and control operation.  The report
recommends the establishment of private sector-organized groups that would
evaluate and endorse information security standards in various industries,
coupled with increased government support for such efforts and the
development of a national security policy for the Information Revolution.
"The private sector cannot sit back and wait for government to lead," says
Sen. Charles Robb (D-Va.), a member of the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence.  (InternetWeek 16 Dec 98)
