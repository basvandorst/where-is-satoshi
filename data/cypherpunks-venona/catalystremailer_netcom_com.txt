This file contains important information regarding the Skipjack
standard encryption system. Please read this file through before
coming to any conclusions. Please do not ask me who I am. I have no intention of revealing my identity.
I will start at the beginning. The Skipjack encryption system,
initially known as Clipper, was first publicly announced in mid-
1993. After an initial storm of controversy died down, escrow
agents were selected and the chip went into production in early
1994. Several major hardware vendors used Skipjack, and sales began
to accelerate in the third quarter of 1994 as business users
recognized the advantages of the convenient, inexpensive, and
highly secure system. By the first quarter of 1995, Mykotronx could
no longer keep up with the orders, and demand was still increasing
Several other electronics companies came forward, arguing that they
could manufacture Skipjack chips more cheaply than Mykotronx, in
larger volume, and with at least equal security. The NSA hesitated
to give more companies its classified algorithm, but at the same
time, they certainly did not want Skipjack to die from lack of
available hardware just as it was becoming a standard. After a
delay and threats of restraint-of-trade lawsuits, NIST released a
set of security requirements. Any company which met them could
receive the classified algorithm and make Skipjack chips. Numerous
companies jumped in immediately.
By Christmas 1995, the price of Skipjack chips had fallen sharply.
Secure telephones were rapidly becoming a consumer product, just as
the telecom companies started their Christmas advertising drive.
Remember these slogans?
"This Christmas, Give The Gift Of Privacy. AT&T Secure Telephones!"
"Motorola Secure Cellular Network. Because It's Nobody's Business  But Yours!"
The promotion worked - secure phones were the hottest-selling
product of the season. At the start of 1996, there was an installed
base of over ten million, with no end in sight. Companies were
making secure faxes, secure modems, secure LAN's, and secure
microwave systems. The long-awaited crypto revolution had begun,
and NSA was thrilled. Skipjack would soon be used for all types of
business communications as well as telephones - everything which
needed protection could be taken care of with a single solution.
At the time, I was a senior in college and working evenings for a
company which had just received its security clearance. I did not
have access to any classified data; my job was to operate and
maintain their front-end system, which took orders, kept track of
stock, etc. There was a separate, isolated LAN for the classified
work of designing and programming chips. The company tried to
follow all of the technical rules, but the people were hackers and
businesspeople, not spooks. And most security problems are people
My boss did have a security clearance. He was working late one
Friday on one of the classified machines used to write microcode.
When everyone else had left, he asked me to fix a problem with the
network. That was a violation of security, but I did know more
about networks than he did, and all the classified data was
supposed to be locked up for the weekend. The safe had a time lock,
which could not be opened until Monday.
My boss had made a mistake while he was logged in as root, and he
did an excellent job of hosing the file server. He was not supposed
to have the root password at all. He'd had an argument with his
supervisor about computer access. The supervisor refused to give
him the password, so he stole it. Now his ass was on the line - if
the file server wasn't fixed by the next morning, he was history.
He didn't exactly admit it all at once, but that's what happened.
We took a look at the damage, and began the long, slow job of
recreating the filesystems, reinstalling Unix, restoring the data
from backup tapes, and, most importantly, hiding the evidence. By
8 o'clock, we were both starved. I was doing most of the work - he
was watching, reading manuals, and sweating bullets - so he decided
to go for food.
While waiting for a backup tape to run, I opened the desk drawer
out of boredom, and - whoops! - there was a manual stamped SECRET.
Some programmer was using it to write the microcode for a new low-
power CMOS Skipjack chip, and he hadn't locked it up. After all,
this is a secure building. Nobody without a security clearance is
even allowed in this room, right? So what's the big deal? People
problems! I couldn't resist taking a look, and there was a complete
description of the Skipjack algorithm, among other things, with
each page marked SECRET at the top and bottom. I had about 20
minutes until my boss returned. There was a Xerox machine, warmed
up and ready to go, in the next room. What would you do?
So I stood there, turning pages and hitting the button, listening
to my heart pound, waiting for the click of the outer door as my
boss walked in. I wasn't hungry any more. If I heard that click, I
had just enough time to toss everything behind the copier, run back
to the workstation, and hope to put the manual back later.
But there was no click. By the time my boss returned with a pizza,
the copies were in my car and the manual was in the drawer. My
appetite returned with a vengeance as the adrenaline wore off. By
2 am, the machine was restored to normal. My boss shook my hand and
thanked me, and then I went home and passed out cold.
The next day, I woke up around noon and took a look at my loot. The
algorithm strongly resembles DES. It's a highly improved DES, of
course, but the structure is similar. It uses 32 rounds, and an 80-
bit key, and they process the key before using it to eliminate weak
keys. I started coding it at home in C to hack around with, not
having any particular plans as to what I'd do with it. I was just
enjoying the thrill of having something few others had.
The program worked, but it was horribly slow. Skipjack is optimized
for a pipelined hardware implementation, using 32 processing
elements, one for each round. Even a good software implementation
is almost uselessly slow.
Once I had the basic electronic-codebook function working, I
started implementing the rest of the Skipjack protocol around it.
After a month of on-and-off hacking, I had a complete software
clone of a Skipjack chip, which could be assigned any serial number
and device-unique key. Without the family key, however, there was
no way to create a proper LEAF. The version of Skipjack in this
file is much improved, but similar in structure, to the original.
For a long time, that was all I did with it. Without hardware, it
wasn't fast enough for a no-LEAF secure telephone. I scanned the
copies I'd made, encrypted the image files, and made a bonfire with
the paper copies. Not the kind of thing one should keep around.
Then I started experimenting with a programming technique called
genetic algorithms. These are algorithms which evolve their outputs
by creating successively better results. Multiple results are
generated and evaluated, the best are copied, the rest erased. The
remaining ones are then "crossed", simulating sexual reproduction,
and the cycle repeats.
Looking for an application, I decided to see how far a genetic
algorithm could go in attacking Skipjack. At the time, I'd have
been thrilled if it broke one round. What happened next - I didn't
do it! I didn't know then and don't know now how it works.
Using keys as the strings my algorithm would create was no good.
Genetic algorithms make incremental progress; with crypto, if one
bit is off, it's useless. Instead, my strings were programs written
in a little interpreted language, specifically designed for
cryptography. The genetic algorithm would evolve programs. This
approach has been used for various things in the past.
I started out with less than a round, with only the first
transformation of the first round. The genetic algorithm wrote a
program to solve that, no problem. But as I made it harder, using
more of the round, it failed to progress. So I tried something new:
there are programs which clean up spaghetti code, making readable
and usable code out of it. They are used to make 30-year-old Cobol
maintainable. I used one to take the most successful programs which
evolved, clean them up, and add them to the language itself as new
commands. When it got to the second round, the blocks out of which
those programs were built included the most successful methods used
against the first round. This way the program could build on its
own successes.
The computer ran 24 hours a day, and it progressed as far as the
fifth round. I was surprised that it worked at all, but I didn't
know if five rounds was good or bad. There has never been any
public research with Skipjack, but DES is much easier to break if
fewer rounds are used, so I assumed I hadn't really done much.
Before leaving for a weekend, I made several changes to the
program: improvements to the crossover routines, removing old,
nonuseful commands added by the evolver, and code which increased
the difficulty, one piece of one round at a time, each time the
programs were successful. There were a few other changes. There
were also several bugs in the program, including at least one wild
pointer which scrambled some of the evolved functions. How these
bugs affected the ultimate outcome, I don't know. Something like
Frankenstein's lightning, I suppose.
When I got back Sunday evening, I turned on the monitor and
couldn't believe it. It had gone through all 32 rounds - cracked
the code! Impossible, had to be a program bug. So I encrypted some
text using the function I'd written, fed it in, and went to bed.
The next morning, I expected the program to be crashed. Instead,
there was the key. Somehow, I don't have a clue how, the algorithms
evolve to fit each piece of ciphertext. They go down, like a diver
taking treasure from a sunken ship, and pull those patterns to the
surface. I've never been able to trace it. All the data looks
random, but the solution emerges in the end. Much like neural
networks: they can solve a problem, but they can't tell you how
they did it. That's one reason why people don't trust neural nets.
The next day, I kept trying it with different pieces of text.
Imagine opening your trunk and finding it stuffed with cash - I
kept opening it and looking to see if the money was really there.
Sometimes it was faster than others, but it always worked as long
as there was a pattern to the plaintext.
I started acquiring equipment and components. 32 RAM-based logic
array chips, similar to PAL's but using SRAM instead of ROM. One
for each round. These I connected to form the equivalent of a
Skipjack chip, equally fast but fully controllable. A used minivan.
Nonmetallic composites are popular for car bodies - they may stop
a bullet, but radio signals go right through them. No need for
visible antennas on the outside. A new 8-gigabyte hard drive.
Plenty of RAM for a disk cache. A software encryption program - I
wasn't about to use Skipjack, and my hard drive would need
encrypting. A small microwave dish and receiver - they've replaced
cable, carrying TV and all kinds of data transmissions. Encrypted
with Skipjack, of course.
By this time, mid-1997, Skipjack had already gone global. Most of
the money transferred around the world moves by Skipjack. Almost
all large corporations use it for their voice, data, and fax
networks. It has been designed into the lowest levels of the new
Information Superhighway under construction, and has replaced RIPEM
as the official privacy standard on the Internet.
Each country keeps escrows for all chips manufactured and used
within its borders. These are used for national law enforcement.
The United Nations has a master escrow, containing all of the keys
in the world. This is used to police international terrorism, arms
and drug trafficking, etc. There are, of course, very strict rules
governing when and to whom the UN will release keys.
This system works very well. It has put the squeeze on drug money
like nothing that came before it, because the large cash
transaction stands out in a world of electronic money. All major
crimes are difficult - the Mafia is nearly extinct. ATM and credit
card fraud are almost a thing of the past - the Skipjack smart card
has replaced the mag stripe and the card number. New phones have a
slot, rather than a built-in chip, allowing people to carry their
identities wherever they go.
I didn't counterfeit electronic money - that would eventually be
noticed, and besides, I'm not a thief. Nor did I secretly transfer
money to myself. I just drove to New York, one of many places where
information worth billions of dollars moves everyday over microwave
beams. Then I parked in the path of one, turned on my inverter -
connected to four marine batteries; running out of power during a
hot intercept is highly annoying - and powered up my scanner.
Having cracked the family key, I could quickly extract the serial
number from each transmission. The hardest part is deciding what,
out of the gigabytes flowing by, to tap. Once I choose a
transmission, I feed it to the genetic algorithm. If I get anything
interesting, I keep that serial number, and I know to tap that chip
again when I see the serial number.
Perhaps I intercept the draft of your lousy quarterly earnings
report, bouncing from one suit to another as they try to cover
their asses. Then I sell your company short. Or if I intercept good
sales figures, I buy your stock. Sometimes I buy options, although
it's easier to lose your shirt that way. They aren't all winners -
the market reacts strangely sometimes - but enough of them are to
make me a millionaire in a couple of years. Besides, it wouldn't
work if all my picks were accurate. Someone would get suspicious.
I've really made very poor use of my luck. A corporation could have
practically taken over the world. But it would have been detected
eventually. By keeping it small and being careful, I've been
successful. For the last five years, I've lived as a parasite,
feeding on information and using it to my advantage. For a while,
I went through a voyeuristic phase, driving down the freeway,
tapping phone calls at random. That didn't stay interesting for
very long; most phone calls are boring.
So why am I revealing this now? Why would I give up my master key?
Not willingly, I assure you. But I feel that I have no choice.
Recently, there have been two unexplained crimes: large amounts of
money have been electronically transferred from corporate accounts,
simply vanishing. In both cases, the police have suspected an
inside job. MIS and finance managers were arrested - and released,
because there was absolutely no evidence against them. There was,
in fact, no evidence at all. The money was just gone.
The police may suspect an inside job, but I think otherwise. I am
very familiar with such crimes, because I spent much of that first
year planning them, thinking about how they could be accomplished.
Someone else, I am convinced, has discovered the master key. I
would suspect an organization, not an individual. Either they have
corrupted the escrow system, or they have cracked the code too. And
they do not intend to stop at personal wealth. From an offshore
base, they could, in one day of frantic activity, hold the world
economy hostage. Or they could drain us more slowly, over a period
of a few weeks. The thefts were intended to provide them with
capital and experience for what could be the greatest heist in the
history of money.
So what can I do to prevent this? I could go to the NCPI - the
National Cryptography and Privacy Institute, formerly the NSA - and
show them my system. They might throw me in the slammer for
espionage and securities fraud. More likely, they would make me a
deal - my freedom for my silence - and begin the long process of
designing a new encryption algorithm. But they would not believe me
when I told them that someone else had also cracked the code. The
idea is almost too horrible for them to contemplate - the whole
world runs on Skipjack - and without convincing evidence, there is
no way they would believe me. I don't have any convincing evidence.
Action has to be taken now, before it's too late, and there's only
one way to cause that. Tell the secret. Publish the algorithm,
publish the method of breaking it, and of course, publish this
file, so people will understand why I did what I did. I will be
flamed, called every name in the book and some that will be made up
for the occasion. They may try to hunt me down. There will be chaos
for a few days, maybe a few weeks. The world financial system will
grind to a halt, as programmers work frantically around the clock.
Software cryptography will have to be quickly installed, until a
new hardware system can be designed. For now, incompatibility will
return, efficiency will be reduced, and a lesson will be learned.
Hopefully, the NCPI will not make the same mistake twice.
Hopefully, they won't classify the algorithm next time.

simply vanishing. In both cases, the police have suspected an
inside job. MIS and finance managers were arrested - and released,
because there was absolutely no evidence against them. There was,
in fact, no evidence at all. The money was just gone.
The police may suspect an inside job, but I think otherwise. I am
very familiar with such crimes, because I spent much of that first
year planning them, thinking about how they could be accomplished.
Someone else, I am convinced, has discovered the master key. I
would suspect an organization, not an individual. Either they have
corrupted the escrow system, or they have cracked the code too. And
they do not intend to stop at personal wealth. From an offshore
base, they could, in one day of frantic activity, hold the world
economy hostage. Or they could drain us more slowly, over a period
of a few weeks. The thefts were intended to provide them with
capital and experience for what could be the greatest heist in the
history of money.
So what can I do to prevent this? I could go to the NCPI - the
National Cryptography and Privacy Institute, formerly the NSA - and
show them my system. They might throw me in the slammer for
espionage and securities fraud. More likely, they would make me a
deal - my freedom for my silence - and begin the long process of
designing a new encryption algorithm. But they would not believe me
when I told them that someone else had also cracked the code. The
idea is almost too horrible for them to contemplate - the whole
world runs on Skipjack - and without convincing evidence, there is
no way they would believe me. I don't have any convincing evidence.
Action has to be taken now, before it's too late, and there's only
one way to cause that. Tell the secret. Publish the algorithm,
publish the method of breaking it, and of course, publish this
file, so people will understand why I did what I did. I will be
flamed, called every name in the book and some that will be made up
for the occasion. They may try to hunt me down. There will be chaos
for a few days, maybe a few weeks. The world financial system will
grind to a halt, as programmers work frantically around the clock.
Software cryptography will have to be quickly installed, until a
new hardware system can be designed. For now, incompatibility will
return, efficiency will be reduced, and a lesson will be learned.
Hopefully, the NCPI will not make the same mistake twice.
Hopefully, they won't classify the algorithm next time.

Well, this apocraphyl scene is easily avoided - remailers can be
configured to refuse remailing to whitehouse.gov.
But then this is the Secret Service.  Are they more likely to
a) seize all equipment peripherally related and a bunch that isn't
b) inquire about having anonymous mail blocked
Undoubtedly we could launch into a discussion of why it is anybody
with a pocket full of change can walk up to a payphone and leave a
variety of threats at the whitehouse switchboard - the phone
company need not fear having its equipment seized, while a computer
used in forwarding mail containing the same threats will probably be
taken along with anything else the SS feels like taking.
Gee, I don't know.  Does the phone company have any government deals,
say to manufacture products using a government designed chip, that may
be at risk if its found out that phone company equipment is constantly
being used for threats??
The point is we are in a research & development stage (if you will)
with anonymous remailers, reputations, filters, digital cash, dc-nets,
etc.  It is very likely that the projected reality, desired reality,
and actual reality will be quite different; nevertheless,
experimentation continues.

       AMERICANS ARE PUTTING UP WITH A SPIRALING GESTAPO STATE
                       By Paul Craig Roberts
                 Special to the Los Angeles Times
What will become of "law and order conservatism" now that we know
that our law-enforcement agencies -- from the Justice Department to
local police forces -- can be as criminal as the miscreants that they
are supposed to pursue?
Unspeakable acts of cold-blooded murder and fabricated evidence now
routinely characterize everyday acts of law enforcement in the United
In Malibu, Calif., a 30-person raiding party of sheriff's deputies,
federal drug agents and the California National Guard broke into the
home of Donald Scott and shot him dead.  Scott, it turns out, was a
reclusive man, heir to a European fortune, whose $5 million, 200-acre
ranch was targeted by federal agents under drug-forfeiture laws.  No
drugs or marijuana plants were found, but an alert Ventura County
prosecutor, Michael Bradbury, did find that the raiding party had an
appraisal of Scott's ranch, along with notes on the sale price of
nearby property.  Gideon Kanner, a Los Angeles law professor who has
examined the case, concluded that the feds thought Scott might have a
wife who indulged in drugs and decided to see if they could bag a $5
million piece of property for the Treasury.
In pre-democratic times, this was known as "tax farming".  Government
officials simply seized whatever they could and raked off a
commission.  Today, the commission is in the form of the
bureaucracy's budget.  Ever since President Reagan's budget director,
David Stockman, invented "budget savings" from tougher Internal
Revenue Service and drug enforcement, the pressure has been on these
marauders to farm more revenues.  The results are mounting abuses of
citizens and occasional deaths.
What will be done about it?  Nothing.  Scott, awakened from sleep by
the sound of his door crashing in, made the mistake of walking out of
his bedroom with a gun in his hand.  The military force got off with
a self-defense plea.  Shades of Waco, Texas, where the FBI and the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms folks killed 86 men, women
and children, while the attorney general took all the credit to show
how tough she is.
Noted defense attorney Gerry Spence told the Montana Trial Lawyers
Association in July that he had never been involved in a case with
the federal government in which the government had not lied and
manufactured evidence to gain a conviction.  "These are not the good
guys", he said.  "These are people who do what they believe is
necessary to do to bring about a conviction."  The law gets hung with
the victim.
What, you might protest, about the Los Angeles and Detroit
convictions of police officers who beat black motorists?  Aren't
these signs that checks and balances work and that we are free from
the arbitrary application of power that medieval serfs had to endure?
Alas, these police offers were not done in because they abused their
power, but because they were charged with racism and violating the
civil rights of a member of a "preferred minority".  As incredible as
it may seem, in the United States only blacks have any protection
from abusive state power.  They have a special, racial civil-rights
shield.  The rest of us must make do with happenstance.
Formally, a person could protect himself by getting rich.  But today
that just makes you more of a target.  Witness the fates of
billionaires Michael Milken and Leona Helmsley -- and of Donald
Scott.  Politically ambitious prosecutors need drama, and they don't
get that from the local drug pusher.  Federal drug agents are not
going to waste their time and risk their lives rounding up Jamaican
drug gangs (who shoot back) -- especially when inner-city juries may
not convict either out of fear or feelings of racial solidarity --
when they can pick soft targets like Scott.
Nothing makes it clearer that the United States is no longer a
"nation of laws" than federal wetlands regulations.  These "laws"
have been created entirely by bureaucrats and courts.  All over
America, people are finding their uses of their property circumvented
and themselves in jail because of these regulatory police and their
Recently, the Clinton administartion said: "Congress should amend the
Clean Water Act to make it consistent with the agencies' rule-
making."  And Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont., and John H. Chaff, R-R.I.,
have introduced a bill to codify all the wetlands regulations that
are being enforced without any legal basis.
Note that the two senators did not introduce a bill to stop unelected
bureaucrats from illegally creating laws and running all over our
constitutional protections.  Not even a wrist slap.  To hell with the
U.S. Constitution, say the senators.  Let's pass a law that future
courts will use to give carte blanche to the regulatory police.
Let's ennoble the bureaucrats.  Divine rule cannot be blocked by
special-interest lobbying.

(offered to put crypto code on his site)
I've sent him PGP Tools by email. Please put it on csn and also on soda.
This is the readme file for the package. PGP Tools is a set of functions which allow easy integration of PGP into other applications. This package supports all PGP functions, including key generation, key management, and trust update.

PGP Tools Version 1.0 - The Crypto Construction Set
Brought To You By Pr0duct Cypher
What is PGP Tools?
PGP Tools is a set of functions which allows you to easily write PGP-
compatible encryption programs. It will make it easy to write graphical-
interface versions of PGP for Windows, Macintosh, X, and other GUIs, as
well as to integrate encryption into applications. A few possible
applications include point-and-click PGP, all-in-one secure mail programs,
newsreaders with digital signature capability, keyservers, digital cash
servers, and login authentication.
The toolkit allows you to do almost everything PGP does. The user interface
and program design are up to you. PGP Tools uses a system of dynamically-
allocated FIFO buffers for all operations. These FIFOs can exist either in
memory or on disk. Small amounts of data can be processed entirely in
memory, with no disk access or risky temporary files. It is easy to
manipulate PGP packets directly, if you need to construct anything not
already implemented.
The toolkit has functions to RSA encrypt and decrypt, sign and check
signatures, process plaintext and IDEA ciphertext, take MD5 hashes, perform
ZIP compression and decompression, create and extract ASCII armor, and
perform all types of key management. Keys can be generated, signatures
checked, and trust parameters updated, using simple function calls.
There is no console I/O built into the library, and all file I/O is
concentrated in fifo.c. In those cases where I/O is necessary, such as in
the keyring trust update, the user provides a function pointer. There was
a problem with stack space under DOS, so most of the functions were changed
to avoid storing large objects on the stack.
Most of the documentation is in the .h files. If you aren't sure how to use
a function, look at PTD or at the function code itself.
The mini-application PTDEMO is included as a demonstration and debugging
aid. It will encrypt, sign, decrypt, check signatures, display keyrings,
add keys to a keyring, and perform keyring maintenance. It also has the -x
option which displays a list of packets in any PGP-format file. You will
find this useful in debugging your programs. It is not a full PGP, but it
does attempt to test all the functions in the library. The coding in PTDEMO
is admittedly horrible. PTDEMO was not systematically written; it just grew
as needed to test the rest of the code.
FIFO contains the fifo system. PGPMEM has safemalloc(), and a hash table
for storing keys in memory. The crypto functions are in PGPTOOLS. Key
management, with the exception of the trust update, is in PGPKMGT. PGPKTRU
contains code to do a keyring trust update. PGPARMOR does ASCII armor,
PGPKGEN generates keys, and FIFOZIP performs compression.
How Does It Work?
Everything is done with FIFOs, which take the place of temporary files. You
access a fifo using a pointer (struct fifo *). You can create a fifo in
memory or on disk. Memory and disk fifos are similar with only a few
exceptions, and all the PGP functions work with either type transparently.
You create a memory fifo by calling fifo_mem_create, which returns a
pointer to a new, empty fifo. Then you can use fifo_put to put bytes into
the fifo, and fifo_get to read bytes out. Naturally, the first byte put in
is the first one read out. Fifo_aput and fifo_aget allow you to put or get
an array in one operation. Fifo_length will return the length of a fifo.
A fifo is represented in memory as a linked list of fixed size blocks. Each
fifo structure points to a first and last fifo_block structure. All fifos,
even empty ones, have at least one fifo_block and one fifo_data. Each
fifo_block structure points to a fifo_data structure, and to the next
fifo_block in the chain. Memory is automatically allocated as characters
are put into a fifo, and freed as characters are read out. This means that
in most cases there is only one copy of an object in memory. For example,
if you use pgp_create_idea to encrypt some data, the memory used by the
plaintext is being freed as the ciphertext is being created.
Fifo_copy is used to duplicate a fifo. It does not actually make a copy of
the data, except for the last fifo_data block. Instead, it creates new
fifo_blocks which point to the existing fifo_datas. The fifo_data structure
has a links field which keeps track of how many fifo_blocks point to it.
This is incremented when a fifo is copied and decremented when a fifo_block
is freed. When it goes to zero, the fifo_data is freed. Two fifos can
remain logically independent while sharing a common portion of memory.
Fifo_destroy is used to deallocate a fifo. Some functions (generally those
which are guaranteed to use up their input) do this automatically. Others
(those which may leave some data in the input) do not. Abandoning a fifo
without destroying it will cause a memory leak. Destroying or otherwise
accessing a fifo which does not exist will crash the system. A fifo is not
automatically destroyed when its length reaches zero. An empty fifo can
have more data put into it, if it has not been destroyed.
There are several more functions which work with fifos. Fifo_append adds
one fifo to the end of another, destroying the second one. Fifo_rget allows
you to "look ahead" non-destructively. Fifo_rput is used to update keyring
trust parameters on disk. If they are copies of a fifo, they will change
when fifo_rput is used. Do not use with memory fifos if there are copies.
Disk fifos are used to access files. You can create one with
fifo_file_create, by passing it a FILE pointer. Disk fifos behave much like
memory fifos, except that they access files. Fifo_get will read bytes
starting at the beginning of the file. Fifo_put will put bytes onto the
end. Fifo_length will return the length, equal to the size of the file
minus the number of bytes read. Fifo_copy makes a copy of the fifo. If you
need to use two copies of a disk fifo simultaneously, you should call
fifo_clearlac to reset the file pointers for each one, before using it and
after accessing the other one. Files should be opened with appropriate
modes for the use intended. Fifo_destroy gets rid of the fifo, but does not
close the file.
The fifo system provides a convenient and memory-efficient way to work with
PGP packets. Generally, to create (encrypt/sign) a PGP message, you take
the plaintext and build up the message from it. To extract, you check the
input fifo to see which type a packet is, and call the appropriate extract
function to recover the data.
Some of the key-management functions are high-level, such as checking all
the signatures on a key, merging a set of new keys with the keyring, and
updating the trust parameters for a keyring. Others allow the low-level
manipulation of keyrings. See PTDEMO for examples of their use. A good
description of the PGP file formats can be found in PGFORMAT.DOC in the PGP
source distribution.
Most of the extract functions do not perform error checking on the incoming
packets. Instead, there is a separate pgp_check_packets function which
checks a series of packets for proper format, version, length, etc. This
should be used on any input whose integrity is untrusted.
The random-number generator, pgp_randombyte, is initialized by an input
fifo which contains random data. This can be the plaintext file you are
encrypting, characters and timing from random keypresses, or anything else
which is random. This data is put into a buffer to create a seed. Random
numbers are generated by MD5ing the seed and a counter. The counter is
incremented after each MD5, and is initialized by time(). Pgp_randombyte
can be replaced by any good random number generator. The random number
source will depend on your application. The random generator must be
initialized before calling any function which uses it.
Memory allocation (except within the ZIP compression) goes through
safemalloc(), which calls out_of_memory() if it can't allocate. You should
put in your own out of memory handler, because the default one just prints
an error and exits. There is also an error bailout in the ZIP routines,
although I've never seen it happen. The ZIP functions need more cleaning
up to prevent these bailouts.
There are several more features I'd like to add. Some systems, such as
digital cash banks, will involve servers, possibly accessing thousands of
keys. The sequential PGP key is too slow for this. Servers could use a
separate hash file, taking the least significant bits of the key id as the
hash value. This file would provide pointers into the keyring for fast
access by keyid. Fast access by userid is hard, because userids are looked
up by substrings. If anyone knows of a file format which allows fast
substring searches, without a huge index, please let me know.
PTDEMO has been tested under DOS and Unix. Endian() is used for endian
swapping. On a big-endian machine, defining HIGHFIRST will define out
endian. This should work, but I don't have a big-endian machine to test it.
Some of this code, including the MPI library, the key generation, the ZIP
routines, and some of the ASCII-armoring functions, was written by others
for PGP, and they own that code. The parts I wrote (everything which isn't
in PGP) are not copyrighted and may be used for any purpose, commercial or
otherwise. I don't care how it is used, as long as it helps to make public-
key cryptography more readily available.
Unlike some people, I'm not out to get PKP. If they would sell, for a
reasonable price, a personal RSA license, I would buy one. This license
would allow you to use RSA yourself and to share source code for the use
of other licensed people, but not to sell commercial software without
royalties. If they would agree to allow free non-commercial use, I would
continue to write code, which would simplify commercial implementations.
This would make money for PKP in the long run.
The problem is that every available RSA implementation has strings
attached: you are forced to use DES or ask their specific permission to do
otherwise (RSAREF/RIPEM), to get keys or signatures from RSADSI, to buy a
new key after a mandatory expiration date (DSS), are not allowed to see the
source code to verify the security (ViaCrypt), etc. My interest is in
promoting the use of cryptography. If PKP makes a reasonable profit along
the way, that's okay with me.
I would like to ask PKP's permission up front to release this library, in
the hope of legitimizing PGP-compatible encryption. Unfortunately, the
present grey-area status of PGP, and the oppressive environment created by
the Phil Zimmermann investigations, prevent me from doing so.
I will read and possibly participate in any discussions of this library on
alt.security.pgp, so if you have any ideas, post them there. Any messages
from me will be signed with my key:

@_subject: Re: soda.berkeley.edu back. 
Eric Hollander stated some reasonable concerns about my using the
Cypherpunk remailers....
I have every intention of trying to be as responsible about this as I can
be. I may sound cocky about it at times but I am doing that on purpose to
try to get some attention to my questions. I am genuinely interested in
which remailers can take some traffic. You all DID ask for more traffic.
Here are some random thoughts.
1) Five 40K mails sent at in a row, maybe 3-5 sec. apart doesn't feel like I'm
mail-bombing a remailer. Were these 400K I'd feel pretty guilty. If I'm feeling
like testing limits, I might send 20 mails instead (to myself) but so far this
hasn't caused even a glitch. Soda and cicada seemed to go down out of the
blue, not in the middle of one of my tests. Soda just added a delay of an hour
so that's not really "dead", but cicada did have a heart attack once and bounced
a few mails before recovering.
2) I will never send this package of five mails (~18-46K each) to any mailing
list  unless I do it by sad mistake. I am receiving 6-12 or more messages a day
with  Subject "Bomb me!", so I wouldn't call this unsolicited. The only time a
person  will get the package without asking me personally for it is if they post
to Usenet or this mailing list asking where to get info on PGP. If you are
worried about this I could certainly switch to just sending a note for them to
send me a "Bomb me!".
3) Before I send off a round in the morning (usually about 5-6 "Bomb me!"s), I
send a small "Ping!" message to all the remailers on the list below to make
sure they are working.
4) Here is a list of remailers that I am considering and my experience
with them. I am personally only interested in fast ones (less than 1 hour
delay). I have tagged  a header onto each of my mails telling people NOT
to reply to the remailer address and to try again the next day if one part
doesn't get through.
      1  hh <-[Very fast.]
      2  elee7h5 <-[Very fast.]
      2  hfinney <-[Fast. Warning header.]
      1  hh <-[Very fast, may die and bounce mail.]
      1  hh <-[Very fast, may add an hour.]
      ?  catalyst <-[Fast. Warning header.]
      2  ebrandt <-[Fast, often adds an hour.]
      ?  nowhere <-[Fast, but removes Subject header!]
      ?  remailer <-[Fast, but removes Subject header!]
      1: Remailer accepts only plain text headers.
      2: Remailer accepts both plain text and encrypted headers.
5) I am trying to get a perl script to output csh shell variables instead
of printing  to the screen. Help. I want to make the remailing route
random, thus. Alan Barrett has just posted what I think is an answer to
how I could do this. Maybe I should do the entire thing within perl? I'm not
having much fun reading 'man perl'.
6) Question: should I or should I NOT chain each piece between two
remailers. Will this  increase the load? It is certainly what I've heard
people dreaming about here. I have a mental block concerning what the
effect on remailer load this would have.
7) I would appreciate, as would many, a short list of remailers and some
specs about their qualities and an idea of who is running them, and how
stable they have each been in the last year. catalyst seems
durable, and yet I'd never heard of it till someone just mentioned it in
this mailing list. Are soda and cicada indeed fragile (should I use them)? When
they are up I seem to be able to use them without a problem. Why is jarthur
sometimes very fast and other times adds an hour or more delay?
P.S. Remailer stablility is especially important when chaining remaliers, since
bounced messages will never get back to you. I feel that a next generation of
remailers should not just be concerned with security but with total
internet-like e-mail reliability, as well an easy return address option so I
can use them with more people. I think command-line interfaces are going bye
bye fast, for those who will be the majority of e-mailers in the near future.

"finger qwerty" from outside, to see my local site that I telnet in from,
then typing the master-hacker magic-line "rusers my.site". I am impressed

Award for the entire year of 1994. However, I would rather talk about
remailer security levels than trying to cope with someone embarrassing
themselves posting their "discovery" of my "real identity".
I am not "hiding my identity", I am maintaining a minimal amount of PERSONAL
privacy, at a security level that fits my needs; I am using a NICKNAME. For this
purpose, qwerty and catalyst serve me well. I'm not sure why you have so
much fun disrespecting a person's privacy. I arrived here with a simple
question, "Can I use your remailers for bulk mailing of 1-3MB a day to
people wanting the PGP FAQ and MacPGP Guide? What are the qualities
of each remailer?" I think I understand the movement quite well, but
I understand there IS NO fully secure remailer network which I would bet my
life on. And I understand and am acting upon what few seem to care about,
which is getting a large number of people outside of the internet-skilled culture
using secure encryption. There are 50-100 million Mac and Windows users,
and the majority of those with a modem use their internet connection for simple
e-mail ONLY. Many only HAVE e-mail in fact. PGP has mass media attention,
but very few are using it since they can't get it by a 1-800 number. I hope
ViaCrypt will change this, with Mac and Windows versions.

"finger qwerty" from outside, to see my local site that I telnet in from,
then typing the master-hacker magic-line "rusers my.site". I am impressed
that you too can type these commands, and you get the Xenon Hacker God
Award for the entire year of 1994. However, I would rather talk about
remailer security levels than trying to cope with someone embarrassing
themselves posting their "discovery" of my "real identity".
I am not "hiding my identity", I am maintaining a minimal amount of PERSONAL
privacy, at a security level that fits my needs; I am using a NICKNAME. For this
purpose, qwerty and catalyst serve me well. I'm not sure why you have so
much fun disrespecting a person's privacy. I arrived here with a simple
question, "Can I use your remailers for bulk mailing of 1-3MB a day to
people wanting the PGP FAQ and MacPGP Guide? What are the qualities
of each remailer?" I think I understand the movement quite well, but
I understand there IS NO fully secure remailer network which I would bet my
life on. And I understand and am acting upon what few seem to care about,
which is getting a large number of people outside of the internet-skilled
culture using secure encryption. There are 50-100 million Mac and Windows
users, and the majority of those with a modem use their internet connection
for simple e-mail ONLY. Many only HAVE e-mail in fact. PGP has mass media
attention, but very few are using it since they can't get it by a 1-800 number.
I hope ViaCrypt will change this, with Mac and Windows versions.
 -----BEGIN REMAILER DISCUSSION BLOCK-----
"logs on netcom.  I was just waving enough of a red rag at you to make the
point forcefully...  (remember your the one arguing against putting delays
more than 15 minutes in a remailer system...)"
Finally we are talking about remailers! Thank-you. My telnet log is public.
Netcom's sendmail logs are not (?). There IS a difference. I was arguing
against long delays, which should only be needed if no baseline traffic is
going on. Many people will not be able to function well if say, mail is
batched out at midnight. Rapid two-way communication is very important these
days in getting ANYTHING done, be it above ground OR underground.
"PS How to build your own mailer logs on netcom...just stay on long enough
and keep typing `mailq`...no problemo...I can`t be bothered but if I could
thats how I`d track traffic through qwerty for your $20..."
Now you really do get an award, but not the $20 since that will go to the person
who WAS downloading mailq logs from Netcom ;-). You seem to be absolutely
right. Here is an outgoing piece of mail sent from qwerty:
qwerty: mail alt.test
qwerty: mailq
                Mail Queue (58 requests)
 --Q-ID-- --Size-- -----Q-Time----- ------------Sender/Recipient------------
(much deleted....)
UAA29300*      27 Wed Feb  2 20:13 qwerty
                                   alt.test
And some incoming, as bounced off of hh
UAA29978*       6 Wed Feb  2 20:20                                    "|/u1/qwerty/remail/slocal.pl"
slocal.pl is part of Hal's remailer scripts.
So who has a remailer to send me that will avoid this? Looks like I'd not use
qwerty or catalyst as the first or last stop in a remailing chain. But if the
only way to track this is AS the mail arrives or goes out, I'd still classify
qwerty/catalyst as being good for casual security uses such as my post
to Usenet above. It would be a lot faster than anon.penet.fi! Then again, a
person could blackmail someone for posting to alt.sex.bestiality. When can
I and many others switch from Netcom to a pubic service Unix network
that is private/secure?
*Again, I'm trying to compile a list of remailers and what levels of
   security each entails. Such a list does not seem to exist. If you ever
   want more traffic....
 -----END REMAILER DISCUSSION BLOCK-----
PGP Slave, despite this misunderstanding, could we declare peace and get
on with a discussion about REMAILERS, instead of my nickname. I'm out
here to learn and try to contribute what I can. I am sending info about
secure encryption to at least a dozen people a day, many of whom would
not otherwise get their hands on PGP or even the PGP FAQ, and I have thus
become the most prolific user of the Cypherpunk remailers. I am doing this
randomly, chained between two remailer at a time. This volume could triple
if I started advertising. I don't misunderstand the movement?

@_subject: RE: Magic Money questions 
Magic Money is available from csn.org in the same directory as pgptools.
Be sure to add in the fast mp_inv posted here. It speeds up the unblinding
of a 1024-bit coin from 2 minutes to 3 seconds. Thanks to whoever posted
that code. I will include it in the next release, as soon as some people
shake down the current one for bugs.
If his RNG is bad, he is only hurting himself. If he gets the same coin
as another person, and that coin has already been spent, his coins will
bounce, costing him money. Same is true if he corrupts his packets - the server looks for the ASN string, and if it's not there, bounces the
transaction. He can run his own code if he wants to.
There shouldn't be any, except for deliberate double-spending. The coins
are 128-bits, so you'd need 2^64 of them before the odds favor a collision.
The odds of a coin collision are equal to the odds of two messages having
the same PGP signature.
This is a problem, if this attack is feasible. The coins won't spend if
they don't have the proper ASN string in them, but the server has no way
to see what it is signing. Can someone produce values which will reveal the
private key?
I've heard of attacks which involve getting signatures on factors of a
message, and multiplying them to get a forged signature. These won't work
here, because each coin value is signed with a different d. All you could do
is multiply several invalid coins of value x to get one valid coin of the
same value. But a signature leaking the private key - that is a new one for
me. Please tell me about this attack. How would one prevent it without using
a cut-and-choose protocol?
Applied Cryptography suggests (page 106) that it is okay to dispense with the
cut-and-choose portion of a blind signature in cases (such as this one) where
the user is motivated not to provide a corrupted coin. The coins use different
e's from the bank's PGP key, so a coin could not be used to forge a message
from the bank.
There is no punishment for double-spending. The transaction is simply thrown
out. The bank, in fact, has no way to identify the customer. What could the
bank hope to accomplish by claiming that a coin was already spent? It can
print more coins at any time, so it has no reason to cheat. A server will
have to protect its reputation by not printing too much money or otherwise
making its users angry. If you want to put in an MD5, it wouldn't be hard.
What can be done? The server can hold onto outgoing messages for a while,
and can have a means of remailing those which are lost. Or the message can
be mailed back to the user through two different routes, to increase the
reliability of the system. But one cash-like property of digital money is
that, if you lose the data, you're SOL.
I don't claim the system is perfect. But it's a start, and in my opinion,
that is what digicash needs right now: a start.
These Clipper postings have me worried. It seems as though the government is
in a big hurry to get Clipper on the market. They only have one shot at this.
What needs coded now? A menu-driven PGP? Any ideas for new projects?

@_subject: Re: message pools. 
Jim asked about message pools. Why not just start using alt.test? It's really
not such a noisy group compared to say comp.org.eff.talk ;-)! You must
include "ignore" in your subject line, or the remailer you use will
be swamped by autoresponder messages. And as long as a PGP message already
tattles what the nickname on the key it is encrypted with is, you can up
front put that nickname in the Subject header. At worse, if you want to
"hide" it, just remove the header and footer that announces it's a PGP
message. No one will really notice. You could even add a jpeg header and
laugh at the poor soul who tries to view that "ignore Stacy" jpeg that
he never saw in alt.binaries.picures.erotics. No remailer operators like
me to have to trust. No central pool software. Fuck the waste of bandwidth
complaints, your just running a TEST. You still have to run through a remailer
though, to alt.test so use encrypted remailing. You
can't use those that strip Subject lines, though even if qwerty did strip
Subjects, the return address is in there as "qwerty-remailer" so I wouldn't
see the autoresponds.
I know this isn't a new idea, but he did ask for ideas. You still have to
get the other person to "join the pool" (read alt.test), but that's easier
than getting them to join a real pool which will fill his mailbox daily
with garbage. And you can tell him to "join the pool" in public, say
anonymously on this list, or on Usenet or for God sakes send him an
anonymous snail mail letter! Whatever you do, since "Stealth-PGP" isn't
here yet, I don't see a reason not to include the person's anonymous
nickname in the Subject line or at least in the message, and make
everybody's lives much easier!
I think certain post-by-mail services like news.cs.indiana.edu function like
anonymous remailers if you forge mail to them, in that they strip much
of you original headers away, including the real path but you then have to
connect directly to that post-by-mail site and end up on their logs.
As far as problems go, I don't think the bandwidth problem would be
a big problem since what, maybe a dozen people would be really doing
this in a given week? Perhaps "strength in numbers" isn't going to be
possible yet in the next few years. So be a little naughty and use the
world-wide pool that already exists. The hell with internet bandwidth;
this is one's privacy at stake! I don't have an exciting enough life, so
let me know how it goes if you try it.
 -=Xenon=-
P.S. Maybe Stealth-PGP is a secret and is the reason the jpegs on
alt.binaries.pictures.erotics have become so "noisy" lately ;-).
P.S.S. I'm going to start reading alt.test and misc.test, but I will
not look at anything unless you put "ignore Xenon" in the Subject line!
Look Ma, I'm in a pool. Somebody send me a message, and send me an
anonymous public key within it, and I'll respond back the same way.
Don't sign the Encrypted message; clearsign the message within it!
Then nobody will know "Mr. Nickname" signed it. Why not contact
Pr0duct Cypher this way? Then you aren't taking up space in
alt.security.pgp. Afterall what's a 40K-100K message compared
to how much is in the binaries groups a day?! And you can easily
scan a day's alt.test postings for you name, then trash the rest.
You can even automatically scan the postings for you nickname with
most news readers. Sorry this is so long. I do have a nasty habit of
thinking in public.
P.S.S.S Extropia already has a pool set up, but I've been lazy and
don't know the details yet. With Usenet though, you never end up
on any pool's member list, except the list of all Usenet readers, and
possibly all remailer users if such a list exists. And a guy like
Pr0duct can NEVER be tagged for having picked up the message! No?

@_subject: CERT vs. Net Mafia? 
NEWSWEEK, February 21, 1994, p.73
Technology: How to fight crime on the Internet
A SWAT Team in Cyberspace
Joshua Cooper Ramo
The First Hint of trouble came at 3 a.m. one night last December.  A
panicky New York computer bulletin board operator called the Computer
Emergency Response Team center at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh to report discovering an unauthorized program that could
surreptitiously record users' secret passwords.  CERT is the SWAT team
of the electronic frontier; the call sent these cybercops scrambling
to their keyboards to try and figure out who was behind the break-in -
- and whether it had spread.  "It's like finding rats in your
apartment," says CERT manager Dain Gary.  "When you see one, there are
probably a hundred.  In this case, there are probably 10,000."
The New York bulletin board is hooked up to the Internet, an
international web of computers that links 20 million users.  If one
system is compromised, many more are vulnerable.  The December break-
in turned out to be the first of hundreds of similar reports: earlier
this month Gary's team concluded there was an organized effort to
infiltrate the Internet.  Although the culprits were still loose and
their motives were unclear last week, CERT's detective work has won
the team respect and new attention on the net.  A typical Internet
message: "It's nice to know that somebody out there is helping keep us
techno-peons in the loop."
Created by the Defense Department five years ago after the last
widespread Internet break-in, the CERT team operates out of a sleek
granite building.  CERT has no legal power to arrest or prosecute;
instead, the team of about 15 programmers pokes through violated
systems using their only weapons: dozens of computers.  Like the
hackers they track, CERT team members often work round the clock,
subsisting on takeout Chinese food.  Gary, 52, CERT's manager, is a
decorated army attack- helicopter pilot and an expert in computer
security.  Hackers are "the adversary," he says.  "We try to help the
victim" by posting warnings of "holes" -- vulnerabilities -- and fixes
on the net.  "But as the net grows, the incidents are climbing," he
says.  "The motives are changing."
Net Mafia? Ten years ago hackers were usually youthful pranksters,
mostly interested in demonstrating technical ingenuity.  Now there's a
growing feeling that more sinister forces may be loose, perhaps a kind
of net mafia intent on outright theft through use of credit-card
numbers or other data.
Last year CERT responded to almost 1,500 calls, a 75 percent increase
from 1992's.  CERT won't disclose its budget, but clearly a lot of
help comes from volunteers interested in preserving the integrity of
the net.  Particularly complicated security breaches are farmed out
around the country to an unofficial brain trust of specialists in
specific operating systems.  The rest of the detective work is on line
in Pittsburgh.   Rich Pethia, 47, CERT's coordinator, has spent 25
years working on the net; he says his job gets tougher every year. The team must deal with increasingly sophisticated hackers and
criticism from netters who think that providing hole data is like
giving cybercrooks keys to computers.
Unfortunately, finding holes is often easier than fixing them.  CERT
still doesn't have a long-term solution to the current break-in
problem.  Last week, in response to the CERT alarm, network operators
around the world booted and rebooted their systems, looking for signs
of trouble.   Back in Pittsburgh, the CERT team members were hunched
over their keyboards, ready for the next call.

@_subject: re: CERT funding 
It is precisely when someone says "don't get worried about _____" when
I begin to wonder exactly what they have to hide.
Every government bureaucrat I have met says exactly the same thing.
The idea is to always give the impression of being "hungry" -- if you
think your budget is adequate, obvious it is too much, and if you
think your sources of funding are "secure", then you are taking them
for granted.  Believe me ... I played the game for many years.
You are very naive!  Just because something is funded by an
intelligence agency does NOT mean that it is going to be a brand-new,
state of the art system.  The 3-letter agencies have LOTS of old but
serviceable Suns, DECs, Macs, PCs, etc. internally and their
contractors have the same.  Yes, if they were doing cryptanalysis
they'd have beefier gear, but that is not what CERT does.
The problem is that when one is funded by DARPA or directly by one of
the armed services, the amount of your award is supposed to be public.
Usually companies announce it via a press release -- it is
prestigious.  HOWEVER, it is usually a condition of doing business
with the intelligence community that the existence and amount of your
contract award is kept secret.  THat's just the way they work.
Don't be lulled by the "grad-student" types either.  the intelligence
agencies have funded a lot of university-affiliated research.  Most of
the grad students and first-real-job people aren't privy to the
internal funding and resposbility and deliverables of the group.
Were you asked about your ability to get a security clearance?  According to one article, CERT people now are getting clearances.  Yes, other CERT-type teams exist.  They are collected in an
organization called FIRST, the Federation of Incident Response Teams.
They do share (some) info.  Blackworld teams have different issues and
do not generally participate, since their risk exposure is different
and their issues are usually different as well.  But they exist too.

Hey Matt, I'd be interested in a copy of your code!
Well, you do have to be careful: a large number of keys doesn't mean a
cipher is hard to break, there may be a faster method than brute
force.  For instance, those cryptograms some papers print in the
puzzle section are a simple substition cipher, with 26! keys... yet
they are also pretty much trivially breakable with enough input.

US News & World Report

U.S.NEWS & WORLD REPORT, MARCH 14, 1994
DECODING THE ELECTRONIC FUTURE
By Vic Sussman
WILL ENCRYPTION SECURE OR DENY PRIVACY RIGHTS? Would you hand over a
spare set of house keys to your local police to help them fight crime,
trusting that they would never enter your home without good reason?
According to opponents of the so-called Clipper chip, a powerful new
telecommunications encoding device, that is an apt metaphor for what
the White House, the FBI and the supersecret National Security Agency
are asking of a gullible American public. Clipper backers insist the
innovation will not only help in an increasingly desperate fight
against crime but actually give Americans more privacy than ever.
   The Clipper controversy--which has sparked frenzied debate and
angry protests in recent weeks--swirls around a small sliver of
silicon that can be built into telephones. Ordinary phones can be
tapped with anything from cheap scanners to quaint-tech alligator
clips. But Clipper phones use encryption technology to scramble voice,
fax, electronic mail and other data transmissions into digital
gibberish. Only other Clipper phones can unscramble the information,
which makes the Clipper an untappable system. Well, almost.
   A phone that can't be tapped is every cop's nightmare, because
anyone from drug traffickers to terrorists would be able to scheme and
plot with impunity. So under a plan hatched by the NSA and backed by
the White House, government agents would be able to unscramble
Clipper's secret code by using two mathematical keys. To guard against
abuse, the keys would be held by two government agencies. Authorities
would first have to get a warrant--standard wiretap procedure--before
obtaining the decoders.
   Key escrow, as it's called, may sound good on paper, but critics
maintain it will be both invasive and ineffectual. In addition,
Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont maintains that Clipper is a
``misstep in export policy.'' U.S. companies would have a tough time
selling compromised telecommunications products overseas and
consequently would have to manufacture both domestic and foreign
versions, an expensive proposition. IBM, Apple, Microsoft and the
Software Publishers Association, among many others, oppose Clipper.
Leahy's Technology and the Law Subcommittee is planning March hearings
on these issues.
HISTORY'S SHADOW. Critics are also doubtful that Clipper's decoding
keys will be sufficient to deter government recklessness, pointing to
past abuses by the FBI, NSA and CIA. But Georgetown University
computer scientist Dorothy Denning contends that much more stringent
controls against illegal eavesdropping exist today. ``The greater
danger,'' she insists, ``is losing the ability to wiretap, giving
organized crime and terrorism the advantage.'' Law enforcement
authorities also say they are looking for no more authority than they
already have--to make lawful requests to have the telecommunications
industry cooperate in crime prevention. But Marc Rotenberg, Washington
director of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, a
public-interest group that has collected more than 50,000 signatures
on an anti-Clipper petition, doesn't buy that argument. In fact, he
says, the government has admitted the system could be easily breached
by the NSA, which wouldn't need a warrant if it made its demand under
the rubric of national security. Many valid concerns about Clipper,
says Rotenberg, ``are similarly dismissed with the claim of national
security, a dangerous way to design our civilian communications
   The Clipper chip has been proposed as a voluntary standard. But
once the Internal Revenue Service, the Pentagon and other agencies
order tens of thousands of Clipper phones, it will be impossible to do
government business using any other equipment. Indeed, the biggest
fear raised by Clipper is that it is the digital camel's nose under
the electronic tent. Another White House proposal, for instance, would
require that all future telecommunications systems--everything from
phones to online services--be ``wiretap friendly,'' says Jerry Berman,
executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Even the
most vociferous Clipper opponents concede a legitimate need for
electronic surveillance, but many would like to see Congress rather
than agencies like the NSA determine the proper balance of government
needs and individual rights.
   Cliff Stoll, whose book THE CUCKOO'S EGG focused attention on
computer espionage, thinks the Clipper controversy is overblown by
both sides. In fact, he contends, the typical telephone or computer
user doesn't need any encryption more powerful than pig Latin.

DON'T LET WASHINGTON PLAY 'I SPY' ON YOU
Will the Information Superhighway enable the federal government to

worst nightmares?  For those who believe in the Fourth Amendment's

The Clinton Administration is pushing two bad ideas left over from

Take the telephone initiative.  Under current law, the government can

Pros and Cons of Anonymous Corporate E-Mail
By Michael Schrage
    XYZ Corp. (not its real name) has a problem that's driving top
management crazy.  A rogue piece of software has appeared that lets
employees send electronic mail messages anonymously.  There's been a
rash of sexually suggestive -- and even obscene -- e-mail sent to
several female employees.  Unpopular managers have received insulting
e-mail appraisals of their style and performance.
      More ominously, several messages have been broadcast detailing
serious problems with several of XYZ's key projects.  These were
setbacks that had previously been the secret of top management but,
thanks to XYZ's global network, have now been instantly distributed
worldwide to launch hundreds of e-mail queries and thousands of water-
cooler conversations.
    Like kerosene poured on a fire, this act of e-mail anonymity has
ignited once-smoldering resentments into openly burning issues.  While
half the company is thrilled that anonymity has caused these problems
to surface for corporate-wide discussion, the other half is furious
that the leakers can't be found and punished.
    Ultimately, XYZ's top management pulled the plug on its global e-
mail system, rewrote the network software to assure that all messages
can be tracked at least two ways and issued an edict that absolutely
forbids anonymous messages.  The traffic that now flows on XYZ's
network is excruciatingly polite.
    This XYZ Corp. example is hardly fictitious; it's an unhappy
composite of real-world confrontations that recently occurred in
several Fortune 1,000 companies.  More than any other e-mail issue,
the anonymity option provokes the most heated debate in organizational
network design.
    The right to e-mail anonymity strikes at the very heart of values
that organizations either cherish or try to suppress.  Some
organizations see anonymity as a healthy, essential part of their
internal dialogue, a mechanism that promotes free and unfettered
comment.  Others see anonymity as a sleazy virtual mask that lets
corporate mischief makers and malcontents get away with cheap shots at
people who have the guts to sign their names to their messages.
    At one giant aerospace manufacturer, for example, managers are
positively grateful that their brainstorming software encourages
anonymous contributions.  "If we had to attach our names to our
suggestions, I think people would be less forthcoming," insists one
engineer there who, yes, asks no to be identified.
    The culture of the company, he argues, makes it difficult for
younger engineers to publicly make comments critical of senior
engineering decisions.  The fact that software anonymity effectively
subsidizes the existing culture rather than encouraging a more open
and honest exchange of ideas is dismissed as politically unrealistic. "Have you lost your mind?" the engineer asks.
    The anonymity issue becomes even more intense when one considers
the speed at which organizations are linking their e-mail networks
together in hopes of creating "virtual" corporations and accelerating
the flow of vital data.  Companies are hooking up with key customers
and suppliers.
    Suppose at the customer network, anonymous messages are permitted
and even encouraged; at the supplier, they're strictly forbidden. When these two companies collaborate on a project, whose e-mail
protocol should win?  Ironically, the ability to communicate via e-
mail may lead more to a hostile clash of values than to the desired
goal of better communications.  Privacy is relative; anonymity is an
    So how does the Internet, the world's biggest and best e-mail
network, handle this thorny issue?  In fact, it is "illegal" and
technically impossible to send an Internet message without a "return
address," i.e., without some sort of identifying header.
    Nevertheless, the Internet has become a hotbed of detailed,
intimate and absolutely anonymous communications.  Indeed, there is a
whistle-blowers Usenet group on the Internet -- a kind of forum -- as
well as a support group for victims of sexual abuse.  Is it in the
best interests of these participants to be readily identifiable? These groups depend on anonymous communications.
    Market forces have created innovations for anonymity.  Because
there is a demand for anonymity on the Internet, there is now a supply
of anonymity on the Internet.  Individuals can send their messages to
"remailers" that can strip out the headers containing the authentic
return address.
    These remailers, in turn, can send the messages on to other
remailers.  In other words, Internet remailers can "launder" messages
on the road to their intended destinations in ways that completely
obliterate their origins.
    A company that's on the Internet could use remailers to send e-
mail or post messages anonymously, but there are no known Fortune 500
companies that provide such remailers internally.
    Essentially, the rise of e-mail is forcing companies to decide
explicitly what kind of values they want their networks to embody. Should employees be allowed or encouraged to send anonymous e-mail? Or should it be strictly forbidden?  Or is there a middle way that
creates bulletin boards or other e-mail "Democracy Walls" where
individuals can safely post their comments?
    Whatever the answer to these questions, more and more
organizations are painfully becoming aware that their new networks can
raise cultural tensions just as easily as they create economic

GROUP AIMS TO INTRODUCE BUSINESS TO THE INTERNET By DAVID BANK Mercury News Staff Writer
FOR entrepreneurs who are seeking to create an electronic marketplace for
Silicon Valley businesses to buy, sell and pursue profits, the creators of
CommerceNet have a distinctly un-capitalist marketing plan for their key
They're giving it away.
When CommerceNet, the first large-scale trial of electronic commerce over the
Internet, goes on-line Tuesday, computer users finally will have a secure way
to make payments, send confidential documents and verify the identity of the
person or company at the other end of the e-mail message.
That security system is the key to unlocking the commercial potential of the
Internet, the network of computer networks that connects more than 20 million
users, said Jay Tenenbaum, chairman of Enterprise Integration Technologies in
Palo Alto, which is leading the CommerceNet effort.
CommerceNet is working to overcome the other obstacles that have prevented
the Internet from becoming an accessible, full-service network for business
and the general public. These include the lack of an easy-to-use interface,
high prices for the high-speed telephone lines needed, and widely varying
standards and systems that make true collaboration difficult.
As solutions to those problems are found, Tenenbaum predicts, CommerceNet
will revolutionize the way business is done. CommerceNet's promotional
literature blithely lists as one long-term impact the disintegration of
vertical companies.
''This is monopoly busting,'' Tenenbaum said. ''We think there will be an
immediate, demonstrable edge in competitiveness for the companies that are
In Tenenbaum's vision, large manufacturers will be able to quickly put their
orders out to bid, driving down costs. Small businesses that develop a needed
new service will be able to compete with industry powerhouses, because the
cost of distributing their products electronically will be, essentially,
Participating companies, initially, include Lockheed Missiles and Space Co.,
Hewlett-Packard Co., Digital Equipment Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp.
One new business already has been created on CommerceNet: the Internet
Shopping Network, a computer buying club based in Menlo Park that will be
launched at the same time CommerceNet is introduced at Santa Clara's
''We couldn't do it without CommerceNet,'' said Randy Adams, president of the
Internet Shopping Network, who estimated the cost for each sales transaction
over CommerceNet at 20 cents, compared to $5 for an 800-number telephone
order. ''Our costs are the lowest anywhere because of the way we leverage the
Many companies already use private electronic networks to communicate with
their suppliers or collaborate with strategic partners. But such networks are
expensive, exclusive and require prior arrangements to ensure smooth
interconnections. For example, Ford Motor Co. requires its suppliers to use a
particular computer-aided design program for the transfer of specifications
and blueprints. If the supplier also wants to sell to General Motors Corp.,
it may need a different system.
CommerceNet's goal is to bring the capabilities of the private networks into
a public network, so that any business or individual can participate in the
competitive marketplace spontaneously, without prior arrangements. Unlike
commercial on-line services such as America Online or Prodigy, CommerceNet is
an open marketplace. Anybody with a computer ''server'' can create an
electronic storefront, or ''home page,'' which will be included in
CommerceNet's directory.
At first the home page will be little more than an electronic brochure of a
company's products or services. Then, catalogs will be added. With the
ability to send and receive electronic payments, orders can be placed and
Soon, bids will be requested and received electronically. Services will
develop to search for and compare prices in various catalogs. The need for
other services, such as banking, brokerages and specialized directories will
create opportunities for new businesses.
But to create these opportunities, CommerceNet decided it had to seed the
marketplace. Some of the work already had been done by others. For example,
CommerceNet will rely on free software known as Mosaic, which gives Internet
users a relatively simple ''point-and-click'' way to navigate among thousands
of information providers. With its ''hypertext'' functions, Mosaic allows
browsers to click on key words to receive more information.
To make Mosaic secure, CommerceNet struck a deal with RSA Data Security Inc.
in Redwood City for the use of RSA's ''public key'' encryption technology.
In simple terms, the technology enables a sender to encode a message in a way
that allows only the intended recipient to decode it. At the same time, the
recipient of a message is able to verify the identity of the sender. In addition to payment, the security system enables companies to enter into
legal contracts with ''digital signatures,'' to control who sees proprietary
trade documents, and to use electronic letters of credit for financing
purchases. ''Everybody's worried about whether the Internet can be made as secure as the
phone system,'' said Allen Schiffman, the principal architect of CommerceNet.
''Well, with this, we can do much better than the telephone system.''
CommerceNet is able to give away the security system in part because it has
already been paid by the government, in the form of a three-year, $6 million
matching grant from the Technology Reinvestment Program, which supports
projects that aid in the transition from a defense-based to a civilian
economy. CommerceNet will share its lessons and technologies with other
communities that are planning similar efforts, including Boston, Austin,
Texas, and Champaign-Urbana, Ill.
The CommerceNet team also includes BARRNet, a regional Internet provider, and
Stanford's Center for Information Technology. The project is sponsored by the
non-profit Smart Valley Inc., which is pushing high-speed communications
networks as the way to revitalize the local economy.
The state of California put in $500,000, and companies that want to
participate in the governance of CommerceNet are expected to contribute
$25,000 eachin cash or services. But companies that want to enter the CommerceNet marketplace need not pay
anything beyond the cost of their own hardware. CommerceNet will provide
starter software and technical assistance for free to those who want to
engage in electronic commerce.

@_subject: number theorynumber theory 
All right, a number theory discussion!
Well, this is false.
The above formula is derived from Fermat's Little Theorem, or Euler's
Generalization of Fermat's Little Theorem.
a^(n-1) = 1 mod n, n prime, gcd(a,n) = 1
==> a^n = n mod n
    a^n - n = kn, for k some integer
    (a^n - n)/n = k, for k some integer
now sub in a = 2.
However, the converse of this is not true (n isn't necessarily prime
if it satifies the formula).  Composities that satisfy this are called
pseudoprimes.  For example, for a = 2, n = 341 satisfies the relation,
so 341 is a pseudoprime base 2.
Now it works "most" of the time, and in fact one method of testing
large integers for primality is to choose a whole bunch of a's and
plug in n.  If a^(n-1) mod n != 1, the number is composite and can be
rejected.  But, if a^(n-1) mod n == 1, you can only be 50% sure n is
prime.  (Roughly speaking; Phil Karn notes that the PGP docs indicate
a 50%, I've seen proofs that this pseudoprime test fails 50% of the
time, etc.  But these are upper bounds; the real percentage seems much
lower and I haven't seen a tighter bound on it).
There is a "strong psuedoprime" test, in which failure occurs for at
least 25% of integers in the range, thus the probability that a
composite will pass is at most 25%.
Even better is Lucas' test, but it runs a bit slow.
However, you can be unlucky and pick a Carmichael number, which will
pass the pseudoprime test for all bases relatively prime to n (for all
a such that gcd(a,n) = 1).  Ray Cromwell advises to choose n = 561,
the smallest Carmichael number (an excellent choice!)  Carmichael
numbers exist, they are relatively rare, formulas exists for
generating some of them...
Eric Hughes mentions that 1729 is the next Carmichael number... not
quite true.  1105 is the next Carmichael number.  (But congrats Eric
for even remembering the third one!) ;)
Now, some other topics:
Hm... some confusion here.  A Mersenne prime is of this form (2^n) - 1
where n is prime, but not all number this formula generates are
primes.  Mersenne primes are related to perfect numbers.
An example of a composite of this form:
for n = 11, 2^11 - 1 = 2047 = 23 * 89
Well, no.  These number are Fermat numbers, and while the first 5 (n=0
to n=4) but Euler showed that the Fermat number for n=5 is composite.
As an aside, Fermat numbers satisfy the pseudoprime test.
A couple of issues here:
I think you may be remembering a different theorem, a consequence of
Wilson's theorem.
Wilson's theorem says:   for any prime p, (p-1)! = -1 mod p
The theorem I think you are referring to is:
  if P is the product of the remainders relatively prime to m, then
  P = +/- 1 mod m; +/- = plus or minus
The congruence is +1 except in three cases:
  1) m = 4
  2) m = p^b (m is a power of an odd prime)
  3) m = 2p^b (m is twice the power of an odd prime)
I'm still trying to either prove or disprove your claim!
Two followups relating the the original formula posted:
Good analysis, except for the "n! + 1 is prime" part.  The only thing
you can say is n!+1 has no factors <= n.
For example, n = 4, n!+1 = 25 = 5 * 5.
Still working on this... ;)

No, but hopefully the standard can be extended (officially or unofficially)
to include them, even if only a relatively small fraction of organisations will use the privacy-protection extensions initially. Hopefully once some organisations are doing so they'll have a real competitive advantage over those who want to collect marketing data.
Don't worry - as soon as it hits the streets in Europe I'm sure a
number of us will be ripping out the RC4 code and implementing real
encryption systems instead.... (assuming it comes as source code, otherwise we'll have to upgrade the normal Mosaic source instead
once the standard is settled).
Overall, I think it's a good thing, and hey, at least it isn't using Clipper !

@_subject: Is my DH exchange secure? 
nelson describes some of the precautions required to use DH
exchange safely:
** begin quoted text ***
The prime p wants to be chosen with a little care, and the "random" numbers a and b may want to be "selected" to eliminate certain undesirable values.  I'll explain below.
Within the field Z_p (the set of integers 0..p-1) where p is prime,
there are elements whose successive powers make up all the elements of
the field Z_p.  These numbers are called "primitive" elements or
"generators" of the field Z_p.  That is, if g is a generator of the field Z_p, then the successive powers g, g^2, g^3, ...  g^(p-2), g^(p-1) mod p include all the p-1 non-zero elements of Z_p.
The set of unique numbers produced by taking succesive powers mod p of an
element m of Z_p is a group, the "multiplicative span" of m, which is a subgroup of Z_p.  The number of elements in the group generated by m
is called the "order" of m.  Primitive elements of Z_p have order p-1.
Not all of the elements of Z_p are primitive.  Some elements of Z_p have very small orders.  At least one element will have order 2.
Given that p is prime, the orders of the elements of Z_p will all have
values that are products of some or all of the prime factors of p-1.
Since p is prime (and p=2 is not interesting ;-), p-1 will contain the
factor 2.
An small example may make this point clear.  Let p == 11.
The prime factors of p-1 are 2 and 5.  Hence we expect the orders of the elements of Z_11 to be 2, 5, or 10.  By enumerating the groups of the elements of Z_11 we see this is so (for Z_11).  E.g.

@_subject: Magic Money status and future 
How is the budding digital cash economy going? How many coins are in
circulation, and how many transactions are taking place per day?
Are people just playing around, or are they exchanging things or services
of genuine value?
What's the address of the DigiFrank server, and where's it's key?
Recently I posted a functional spec for an automatic Magic Money client.
Nobody said anything about it. Does this mean that (a) it was good, or
(b) nobody cares? If you would have a use for this, please post and tell
me what you want it to do.
For a robust digital cash economy to develop, we will need multiple
servers. In fact, lots of them. We need a currency exchange, preferably
third-party (i.e. not a server operator) and for-profit. To use digital
cash safely, if servers are going to be run by arbitrary people, you
would have to hold many different currencies. This way if one server
goes bust (inflates its currency, gets its secret key stolen, ...) you
have not lost too much.
That means we need Magic Money 2.0. It needs to handle multiple currencies
transparently. You should be able to list your holdings of all currencies,
and the program should be able to track currency rates. A special message
format would allow a currency exchange to update the values stored in the
client automatically, just as the server can update the elist automatically.
I'm looking for design suggestions (and volunteers to code parts of it!)
One point I'm not sure on is: should you be able to pay out multiple
currencies in one payment? It could be done as long as a server-id field
was added to the coins.dat file. The problem is that when you go to
exchange those coins, the client would have to generate multiple messages,
each for a different server, and then you would have to mail each one to
the correct server. Is the complication worth it? How about a command-line
option to put the address of each server before its message? Then those
with direct net access could use a script to do all the mailing for them.
If PGP 2.6 comes out and becomes a de-facto standard, I will probably
update PGP Tools to support both formats. I might even write a patent-safe
PGP Tools which only does the 2.6 format and calls RSAREF (ugggh). But if
I do there will also be an MPILIB-based version which supports both.

* Automatic Client allows software-automated services to accept and
  pay out Magic Money.
* Coin files contain the keyid of the server that created the coins.
  This allows the Automatic Client to accept money from multiple servers.
* New fifo.c fixes a memory-freeing bug in fifo_destroy. This fix was
  previously posted on csn.org as pgptlupd.zip
The keyid is appended to the end of the coin file with a new packet
type number preceding it. These coin files will be accepted by the V1.0
client. V1.0 coin files will also be accepted by the V1.1 clients.
See the README10.DOC file for more general instructions about how to
use Magic Money. This file concentrates on the changes.
The Automatic Client performs the same functions as the manual client,
except that it has no user interface. It is designed to be controlled by
software (PERL scripts or C programs). The program is controlled by
command-line arguments and information piped into stdin. All output is
written to files or sent to stdout. Compiling AC.C with MM.C and the
appropriate PGPTools files produces the Automatic Client. If you are using
a PC, it is worthwhile to get the 8086.ASM file from PGP2.3a and use it.
Define MSDOS, SMALL_MEM, DYN_ALLOC, and UPTON for the MS/DOS version with
8086.ASM. These defines work for both the normal and automatic clients.
Automatic Client Commands
The automatic client accepts one option, and zero, one, or two filenames.
If run with no options or filenames, it will print a help screen.
ac -[option] [inputfile] [outputfile]
- -k display bank's keyid and client's keyid
This prints the keyid of the bank on the first line, and the keyid of
the client on the second line, as 8-byte hex strings.
- -k [inputfile] display keyid of bank which made this coins.dat file,
   or the keyid needed to decrypt an ascii-armored pgp message.
If the file is a coins.dat-type file produced by a client, this will
produce the keyid of the bank that created it. If it is a PGP message,
such as a reply from a server, it will produce the keyid the message
is encrypted with. In either case, it returns an 8-byte hex string.
If the file is from a 1.0 client, there is no keyid so you will get
a NO_DATA error. There is a 1/256 chance that the byte at offset 9
from the end of file will match the identifier byte. In this case, you
may get a no-good server id. If you get a server id but do not recognize
it, assume this has happened.
- -d list coin denominations
Prints the available denominations of coins from the elist file, one
denomination per line. These are all the possible denominations, and their
presence here does not mean you have any coins of that denomination.
- -i [outputfile] initialize client (key length, key name from stdin)
This initializes the client, producing the initialization message
(which must be sent to the server) in the specified file. The bank.asc
file must be present before running this. It creates a key to communicate
with the server. The key length in bits, and the name for the key, are
read from stdin. They should be on separate lines.
- -l list all coins in allcoins.dat
Lists all available coins as a stream of numbers, one coin per line.
- -l [inputfile] print total value of a coins.dat (client output) file.
   Checks signatures and rejects if signature bad
Prints one number, the total value of the coins.dat file specified. If
any signatures are bad, or coins have unknown exponents, the program
terminates with a BADSIG or BADEXP error.
- -p [inputfile,outputfile] process a coins.dat file for exchange with
   the server. Reads from stdin a list of coin denominations to create,
   terminated by 0. Writes to stdout a 128-bit transaction identifier.
Before running this, you must have used the -l above and decided what
denominations to create. Then run this to process the coins and prepare
a message for the server. Feed the denominations you want into stdin, one
number per line, terminated by a zero. There is no checking here. If you
specify less value than you are turning in, you will lose value. If you
specify more, the server will throw out the transaction and you will lose
all the coins you are depositing. This function writes out one value to
stdout: a 128-bit hex identifier. This is an xor of the coinids of all of
the new protocoins created. This allows your script to identify this
transaction when it comes back from the server.
- -r [outputfile] Reinitialize (generate init packet)
This generates a new client initialization packet. If your system is
inactive for a while, do this, send it in, and run -s on it. This will
check for a coin expiration and update your elist if necessary.
- -s [inputfile] Process a response from the server. Outputs the 128-bit
   transaction identifier, followed by total value, followed by any
   message from the server.
This takes a reply from the server (ascii-armored) and processes it,
adding new coins to your allcoins.dat file and removing the corresponding
protocoins. The output is: on the first line, the same 128-bit identifier
generated by -p when this transaction was prepared. On the second line,
the total value added to your coin file (same as the value of the coins
you created in the -p). Following that, any message from the server, if
there is one. If -s is run on a response to a -i or -r initialization, it
will return 00..00 for the identifier and 0 for the value, because no
coins were processed.
- -w [outputfile] Withdraws coins for payment. Accepts a list of coin
   values from stdin, terminated by a zero.
Extracts coins from your allcoins.dat file and writes them to the output
file. Send to stdin a list of values to create, followed by a zero to
terminate. The output file can then be processed by another client.
- -x Returns the total value of any old coins (in danger of expiration)
Checks for old coins that are in danger of expiring. Outputs the total
value of all old coins, or zero if there aren't any.
- -x [outputfile] Exchanges old coins. Accepts a list of denominations
   and generates an identifier like -p
This is like -p for old coins. Run -x above first, decide what denomin-
ations you want to create, and run this. Feed in the denominations, term-
inated by a zero, and send the output file to the server to exchange your
old coins for new ones. If you have expired coins (you didn't exchange
them in time) this will throw them out.
Error codes (from MM.H) These are returned by exit(code) when the
program ends. A 0 is good, anything else is bad. The only errors
that are not included here are out-of-memory and missing rand.dat
file. These will still print English messages, however, if the system
is correctly set up, they should not happen.
 MMAC_OK 0                 /* Normal exit */
 MMACERROR_BADCOMMAND 1    /* Bad command */
 MMACERROR_NOFILE 2        /* File not found or inaccessible */
 MMACERROR_NODATA 3        /* Data such as a key not found */
 MMACERROR_BADSIG 4        /* Coin/file has bad signature */
 MMACERROR_BADEXP 5        /* Coin has unknown exponent */
 MMACERROR_NOCOIN 6        /* Tried to use nonexistent coin */
 MMACERROR_NOPROTO 7       /* No protocoin in file */
Using the Automatic Client
Ok, that's great, but how do I use it? For an automatic service, you want to receive coins, process them, get the response back from the server, and then perform some service. You may optionally want to send some coins back to the person. So first, when a message comes in, you have to decrypt it or dearmor it or uudecode it, or whatever is necessary to get a binary coins.dat file. Then run -l [file] to check its value. If you get a value
and not an error, figure out what denominations you want. -d will list all
possible denominations. Now run -p [file] [output file] and send it your
list of denominations. Record the transaction id output from the client,
along with whatever information you need to keep about the service the
customer wants. Mail the output file off to the server, and go on to the
next problem.
When the message comes back from the server (-k [file] and compare with -k
to verify it is encrypted for your client) run -s [file] on it to deposit
the coins in your allcoins.dat file. The output from the client gives you
the transaction id, value, and any message. Use the transaction id to
look up the information you recorded earlier, and deliver the service to
the customer. The value can be verified if you want, and the message
should probably be saved in a file for later reading. You can check each
new message against the last one and only save it if it has changed.
Occasionally run a -x to see if you have any old coins. If so, figure out
what denominations you want to trade them for, and run -x [file] to
exchange them. You can probably do this part by hand, since coin
expirations are pretty rare.
To pay out money, do a -l to find the denominations to extract, then do
a -w to withdraw them into a coins.dat file.
Handling Multiple Servers
You can run a service that accepts coins from multiple servers. To do
this, you have to keep a separate client directory for each server. When
a coin file comes in, run -k [file] to determine which server it is for.
Using the server id as the directory name would make life much simpler.
Then CD into that directory and process the coins from there. If you get
coins from a 1.0 client (which has no server id), you will have to go
into each directory in turn and try a -l [file] on the coins. You will
get an error return on each one until you find the right directory. If messages are coming back from multiple servers, using -k [file] on the incoming message will tell you which client's key it is encrypted with. Running -k will tell you the key of that client (on the second line). - From this, you can determine which client should process that server's reply. This is probably easier than using the from line in the email.
Ideas for Automated Magic Money Applications
Currency Exchange - Accept one currency and return another, skimming off
a profit. Find the correct exchange rates where the same amount of each
currency is coming in and going out.
Pay-For-Use System - Accept Magic Money to pay for remote access to a
machine, use of a MUD, remailer, news posting service, etc.
Gambling - Accept bets on sports, the stock market, horses, etc.
This is the MGMNY11A release. That means it might have bugs. If you find
any, please post them on Cypherpunks or alt.security.pgp. These are also good places to announce your service, or to contact me.

That was a single ITAR violation. This is thousands.
Huh? Who would want to export DES? That wont have any influence on people's

The sumex case is like a huge year-long "smoke-in", the sort of thing
that might lead to *legalization* of hemp, if the lay public were aware
of it. "Private crypto" (PGP in all its guises) is becoming a standard,
yet its future development has been and still is being severely crippled
by ITAR worries among many who would otherwise be active core PGP
developers. Cantwell, in my eyes, is about *PGP*. I'm all for commercial
RSA, but unless I can send a friend a free copy of it, the hell with it.
Also remember commercial crypto hardly ever comes with source code!
Colin found a serious bug in PGP2.6 where one character was left out
in the crypto code. I believe it was someone else who pointed this out
to him. Had this happened with ViaCrypt PGP or "Microsoft Encrypt",
would you expect it to be found? How can you *trust* a commercial
crypto routine if the exact and compilable source code is not available?
And if PGP does become a standard, why do you want to pay for it 8-) ?
So you wont have to waste the time looking for backdoors in the source?

@_author: keysize^c 
@_subject: RSA Key Size & QP 
A wild card here is the recent work in quantum computing,  done
at AT&T and reported in a recent post by Pal Vitanyi.
With a specialized quantum computer (not clear yet whether one could
economically built it, but it's theoretically possible) one
can factor in polynomial time (computational class "QP", or
something like that).  If cycles on such a computer would be,
say, 1,000 times more expensive than on your PC, then
cracking the key would be 1,000*O(keysize^c) more expensive than generating it, not 1,000*O(c^keysize).  Having a keysize of, say,
8 kbits instead of 1 kbit in this circumstance is not at all overkill; it makes a practical economic difference.   Of course if your info is _very_ valuable and the polynomial is of small degree, even a large key size won't help much.
If such a device was built, we'd want to switch to a cryptosystem whose inverse is not in QP; but some of our current communications
would be compromised.  If a QP machine is with even small probability
feasible within the next few decades (or whatever your timeline of concern is), it makes sense to use larger key sizes.

Here are the biggest breakthroughs in cryptography during the period
when the NSA has been the purported leader in the field, and has enjoyed by far the largest budget:
public key: Diffie, Hellman, Merkle, R.,S., A., etc.
key escrow: Micali  (and the current NSA/NIST scheme has all DES: IBM
Skipjack: probably just a modified DES
IDEA: Swiss
Also zero-knowledge proofs, blind signatures, oblivious
transfer, BBS, and other recent advances were all discovered outside the NSA.
For all their vaunted competence, for all the mathematicians
they have been alleged to employ, despite having a cryptography
budget orders of magnitude larger than any other Western
crypto group, it looks like the NSA contribued to _none_ of the major advances in cryptography that occured during its zenith.

@_date: 1994-06-27 08:59:03
@_author: unknown_name 
@_subject: Re: Is the NSA really competent? 
I think that this reply betrays a serious lack of reading competence.  The
breakthroughs cited were the most important  breakthroughs in the science of cryptography, period.  There are no branches of mathematics
called "military" and "commercial".  The techniques have both
military and commercial application.  There is no evidence that the NSA knows about _any_ fundamental technique that has not been published in the literature.  Nor is there any evidence (save the hearsay about
S-boxes, which were actually developed at IBM) that they have made
any major contribution to the science of cryptography, despite the
massive resources they throw into it.  But they do want to preserve their jobs, so they would like you to think they do.  Their ability to drop hints here and there without having to demonstrate they actually know anything, to make people believe that Skipjack is an "advanced" algorithm without having to actually publish it, in general their ability
to use their top secret status for the purpose of selective
revelation, is perfectly suited to this kind of PR. Thus they can claim to "contribute to American competitiveness" by
releasing Skipjack, an algorithm for which there is _not even
any evidence that it is stronger than DES_, much less state of
the art algorithms like IDEA.  This has the actual efffect
of shooting the American computer security industry in the balls,
while making Congress believe they are helping it.
Note that I am _not_ accusing the NSA of political incompetence.
Any organization that can get a Congressional intelligence committee
to vote its way 13-0, that can keep pushing a warmed-over DES
crippled with a last-minute Rube Goldberg version of key escrow,
in the face of 70% public opposition (and nearly unanimous and quite
vocal opposition in the hi-tech industries) is no political slouch.  Any organization that can increase their budget after their mission
has gone away, knows the ropes in D.C.  They are simply much better lobbyists than cryptographers.
Of course with their budget, they can buy lots of slick hardware.  That doesn't mean they know how to use it well.
Let's face it, our awe of NSA stems entirely from their budget
and their ability to stamps their incompetence top secret.

@_author: And, actually, I thought you did too 
@_subject: the Cypherpunk and the Shadow 
L.Detweiler here. I'm extremely hurt by Hal Finney's recent accusations
that I am trying to `sabotage' remailers. Quite to the contrary, I am attempting to strengthen your infrastructure through frequent use
and pointing out the lapses in design. I see cypherpunks attacking
Unix security holes with such fervor, but how is that you, as designers,
failed to even anticipate a `geometrical explosion' attack after several years of remailer operation? If I wanted to destroy your
remailers I would be sending you exploding mailbombs every second!
Hal Finney claims that I have a `well known enmity' to anonymity &
pseudonymity. Quite to the contrary I am fully in favor of responsible
uses of it. But I also believe it is not for a remailer operator to
determine `responsible use'. (And, actually, I thought you did too). The entire population of cyberspace does not understand this simple concept: cutting off a message at the source is censorship; cutting it off at the destination is filtering. I am trying to force people to understand this. Where are the reputation systems that some Cypherpunks have talked about? They are *far* more important to cyberspatial development than remailers.
And in fact they will help us deal with remailers in a positive way.
The essence of the animosity toward remailers is not that anonymity
is involved, but that people wish to be able to control what they
themselves read, and (for the closet control freaks) what other people read. The latter urge I believe is generally a perversion of
free speech, outside of exceptional cases (e.g. where a parent controls
what their child reads, although even this I have some objections to).
But the former demand is certainly legitimate. I don't believe we have
a right to ever *force* anyone to listen to us.
The basic solution to this is a reputation system that associates a
`credibility' or `interest' factor to `sources' (e.g. senders, identified
by their email addresses) based on collective judgement, i.e. voting.
It is a trivial concept but one which has so far utterly eluded *everyone*
in cyberspace. It is the solution to virtually every filtering and censorship
hullaballo that erupts every few seconds at some place over Usenet, mailing
lists, and cyberspace. The Cypherpunks are in the best position to implement such a system. But
instead you attack the wrong end of the problem, just as everyone else
in cyberspace. Your philosophy should push you to realize the solution,
but you are blinded by the same delusions that everyone else is.
As for recent messages sent to remailers: it is true that I have been
sending many messages. Mathew Ghio has switched off his remailer until
they stop, he says. How fragile a system! How utterly fragile! Strive to achieve the level of resiliency of a phone system. Does the
whole network come to a halt when one crank caller gets loose? Do people
panic and scream that We're Under Attack By the Detweiler The Antichrist
when some telemarketer gets a computerized autodialer? In cyberspace,
it is the equivalent of an atom bomb. Why? Because it is an untamed
wilderness, full of petty demagogues who derive their power and get their
jollies from perpetuating this turmoil by failing to modify the infrastructure and adopt the attitude `our system is not so fragile
it will be destroyed by abuse'. Yes, that is the key: abuse of the phone system exists, but there are
established protocols for dealing with it. It is not a case of every
new `abuse' becoming an international debacle with hordes of people
screaming for blood and vengeance.
Zen saying: `man stands in his own shadow and wonders why it is dark'.

Yes, I am sending out many messages through your remailers. They are
designed to get Netcom to change what I see as oppressive policies:
1. They do not agree that their own forums are public forums. They
prohibit notes about competition and intimidate people from posting
criticism by calling them over the phone over negative posts.
2. Bruce Woodcock censored my other account for the reason that I borrowed a Support `signature' for satiric effect (in news.admin.policy).
On the phone he took the ridiculous position that it wasn't my stealing
the signature but `the content of the message'.
3. Bruce Woodcock at Netcom fails to make his affiliation with Netcom
clear in his messages in netcom.general. He has repeatedly browbeated
and dismissed customers in the forum. I see him as illustrative of
a problem at Netcom where the sysadmins don't really give a damn about
any individual user or customer satisfaction of individuals. And there
is *no coherent policy* about terminating accounts. 4. Whether you realize it, when the people you don't like are censored,
your own protection from tyranny and oppression is diminished. If the
least among us is not free or has been done an injustice, then none
of us are free and we all have been done an injustice. When my account
is yanked without any consequence to Netcom, they can yank any one
of your accounts without consequence.
5. Freedom of speech does *not* exist unless you have *security*. If you
can be deprived your ability to post by anyone, anywhere, anytime, for
any reason, you do *not* have any security. `BS. I can get an account
somewhere else easy.' You are dangerously deluded in this thinking. Unless there are safeguards no one has any right.
6. I have deliberately gone "easy" on my output of messages to remailers.
I could easily flood them all into oblivion. But I am sending messages
at a gentle drip-drip-drip pace. They make an excellent cloud over any traffic analysis being done, IMHO.
7. Ultimately we are on the same side of freedom of speech and privacy. I have only criticized cypherpunks for hypocrisy and sinister aspects of your practices that seem to contradict your own adopted philosophy. If
your philosophy was openly `we are going to poison cyberspace with untold tentacles to manipulate puublic opinion' I might still attack you
but certainly wouldn't accuse you of hypocrisy  8. Someone remarked on my postings as `performance art'. This is my
intent. I am quite amused at people like T.C.May calling it `intense
abuse'. Hee, hee. I can imagine T.C.May going to see Star Wars and
after getting out of the movie diverting all his money into Scud
Launchers because it makes clear DARTH VADAR IS COMING!
9. Why should I lose my netcom account for vague, unspecified reasons?
I am the Oliphant, the Thomas Nast, the Mark Twain, the Doonesbury of Cyberspace. And I have been censored at something like 5 accounts now for my editorial cartoons and razor-sharp satire in cyberspace. Why? Because I am a perfecting this misunderstood `art of flaming and provocation to effect
social consciousness'. And every time that I am censored and no
one gives a damn, and my jugular vein is slashed in front of you all
with nary an objection (and an abundance of encouragement) it is a chip off of *YOUR* rights in cyberspace.
10. I am the Jew of cyberspace, kicked out of my house with my furniture confiscated at Netcom despite my pleadings. Yes, I had
many megabytes of private email and files that were not backed up.
And they all evaporated when someone at Netcom (gosh, I don't know
who, they only give first names) decided they didn't like my scathing
satire of Netcom in news.admin.policy. What was the procedure to
censor me? The criteria? It is as unknown as civility in cyberspace.
Cypherpunks, I continue to try to get you and the rest of the world
in cyberspace to realize you are playing with fire and gasolene. You don't understand the forces at play and you, through your own
actions and thoughts, are perpetuating a dangerously unstable system
when simple solutions are hair-widths away.
Why am I not implementing these so called `simple solutions' myself?
Because the basic problem is not that no one is implementing them,
it is that no one has the understanding to do so. This is a problem
of a serious mental block on the part of everyone with a brain and
a keyboard. And I am trying to break through that mental block in the collective consciousness of Cyberspace the only way I know how.
If you permit my messages to percolate through your remailers, your
infrastructure will be ultimately strengthened as people begin to
understand that the proper response to inflammatory anonymous email
is a disinterested "ho hum yawn" instead of erupting like Mount
Saint Helens or shaking in livid anger like the San Andreas Fault.
You complain about overreaction of outsiders to anonymous mail? It
is nothing compared to your own insane frenzies. `THE REMAILERS ARE
DYING FROM DETWEILER DAMNATION! YAAAAH'
How can you claim I am trying to sabotage your remailers? I am
immensely dependent on them. I am more dependent on them than *you*
are. I don't have a voice without them. My Nyx account would be censored immediately from your screeching complaints if I didn't post through them! I can send messages, therefore I am. I cannot post from my own account, therefore I am dead. Look you target even
innocent bystanders with postmaster-mailing-bomb campaigns without
the slightest provocation! Look at how Tim May immediately exploits
Netcom records to try to `out' me wherever I live in cyberspace?
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
Have you ever read Calvin? `Rules are for everyone else, not for me.'
`I will have the power, but no one else will.' Your grandiose philosophy of privacy, in practice is that `We will be bathed in the riches of privacy but our enemies will be robbed of it.'
I will continue to send my messages through your remailers. If you
wish to shut them down because you really believe they are a threat
to your existence, fine. But if they are, I think you should reconsider
your philosophy of anonymity in cyberspace as fundamentally impossible in practice. I have been *gentle* with your remailers. I haven't even
studied the Perl code for the *really* insidious holes and glitches.
Believe me, if I wanted to destroy cypherpunk remailers I would have
brought them to their knees a *long* time ago. I am trying to provide
the impetus to you to *strengthen* them. And the Netcom `electric
prod' is a way to kill two birds with one stone.
Would I spend dozens of hours writing about `Anonymity on the Internet'
if I was against it? No, your lesson to learn is that I believe in it
with such passion that I have dedicated a significant fraction of my
waking hours to promote it-- but through means that are poorly understood.

@_subject: Re: Ms. Nym's stigmata 
A quick review of the patent stigmata:
Frequent Biblical allusions, particularly fond of apocalyptic references.
Attempts to mask underlying obsession with veneer of rationality.
Fixation on multiple personalities (tentacles, "pseudo-anonymity").
 [ and later ]
Frequent mention of Perry Metzger.
Standard unit of torment: Perry Metzger.
Tireless apologist and supporter of government.
Paranoia never far below the surface.
