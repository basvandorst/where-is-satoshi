Sun, 17 Dec 1995 10:18:50 -0500 (EST) I also disagree because I would interpret it as "It shall not be unlawful...to intercept, disclose or use that communication...except by utilizing *service observing* or *random monitoring*." That indicates to me that specific monitoring is fine, but random monitoring must be used for quality control. And how do you become specific without being random? QC could be whatever the providers deem it to be, the public be damned.
"..anything not specifically allowed is expressly forbidden..."
