@_subject: Could someone briefly describe... 
Could someone please give a brief description of the "Republic of Desire"
for those of us who haven't spent [US]$27 to see Gibson's _Virtual Light_?
What is it?  A gorilla organization of some sort?
What's it for?  Why is it such a neat thing to talk about?
Thanks in advance...

Or, they may not "scan" at all!  Ever wonder why wrinkles, folds, and other
mutilations wreck their ability to recognize your cash?
I think many of them may be measuring paper thickness, folks.

@_subject: Book Info Needed 
Could anyone who has specific information (ISBN, Publisher, [US] Price)
on either or both of these books *please* e-mail or post to cypherpunks?
Thanks in advance...

@_subject: The Key Escrow is a *GOOD* thing. 
I see the introduction of common, publicly promoted cryptography as a
*GOOD* thing... even if it's insecure.  Yes, even if the government can
read every toggled bit of it.
If the public uses cryptography of even the simplest sort as a matter
of routine then the *REAL* cryptography, the really *SECURE* stuff, will
pass through unnoticed.  Why would *I* care if some super-secret agency
could read my clipper'd data?  I'd be using PGP on top of it! only then
my messages wouldn't stand out like so many lights in a dark night...
...more like just a few more stars in the sky.

Compression down to 0.5% ?!?  HA!  Try saying that on comp.compression!!!
Let's see... That's half a typed page of data crunched down into five bytes.
Give me a break.  That guy ought to be sued for false advertising.

@_subject: An Occupied Nitch? 
Terribly sorry to frighten you, Jim.  Nitch is a (very) little-known
nickname of mine from quite some time ago.  There are probably only
five people who ever knew that it had been given to me.
Funny name collision.  I never expected it.  Hope you don't get fired.

@_subject: Where's the Pool? 
Pardon my ignorance, but I'm new to all this...
Where do I find (and how do I use) e-mail "pools"?
As I understand it, they're supposed to help foil traffic analysis...
(Incidentally, I received my copy of _Applied Cryptography_
 with amazing speed.  I only ordered the thing this week, and
 here it is!  Now I've only to find the time to read it...)

@_subject: FORGED POSTING 
The following message gave an error when I checked its signature!
Chalk up another reason we should all be using the ASCII Armor option...
Could someone check *my* sig and see if it's working?

@_subject: Re: MIT Keyserver 
It might be wiser to assume that the machine (or some nearby machine)
was having trouble with all the load that the remailer was putting on it.
...but, of course, you may be right.
That message from "Hober Mallow, Trader to Cyberspace" may give a few
people something to think about over the weekend, hmmm?  Maybe MIT's
administration doesn't want to be involved in that kind of traffic?
Maybe *Derek* doesn't want to be involved in that kind of traffic?
