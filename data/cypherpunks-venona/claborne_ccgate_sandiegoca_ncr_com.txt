     Could we send our postings to the mailer in encrypted format?  That      is... I would encrypt the message with the public key for the mailer,      the mailer would decrypt and re-post to the clear-text mailer and to      the PGP group.          Granted, because the mailer must be run in full auto mode, it won't      be the most secure.  It would mean that all inbound as well as      outbound cypherpunk traffic to my node would be in an electronic      envelope.

     Wimpy yes, but a good start.  I am seeing more and more on clipper and      encryption.  I think I even saw on in the LA Times.  I would reccomend      that we encourage this behavior by writing letters to the editor.       Remember... Power of the press. (some day "power of the net")

        I have the 550.  It has a demo mode on it so that you can hear what      it sounds like to other phones.  I is one of the few phones that will      work in my office (because of all of the EMI).  The range doesn't seem      to be as good as the AT&T phone.  People seem to be able to tell that      I am using it as opposed to when I used my AT&T cordless (it was      stolen).  The sound on my end is _very_ clear.          I tried out the demo mode and you can possible pick out a few words      on it.  I feel much safer using it as apposed to other cordless      phones.  The only company that I have seen sell the Motorola is Sears.
