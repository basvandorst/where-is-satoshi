@_subject: Re: PGPfone contact server/PGP-Fone Registry 
board on a web page I call the "PGP-Fone Registry" which allows you to
leave a message with your name, area code and local exchange on the web
site so others who then visit the page can look you up and e-mail you to
set up a time and place to "hook up" and use PGP-Fone. Its entirely
voluntary and simply a means to facilitate people finding others interested
in using the application. others to use it with. This is intended to help fill that gap if people so
who desire to use it can "advertise," or make known, their availability.
in the *subject* header of the message. This facilitates quick browsing. I
will add a small search engine if the registry ever gets very large. problem experience using the pgp-fone application so we can all benefit
from your trials.
