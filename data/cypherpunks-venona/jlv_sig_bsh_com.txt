quite a long time, though I've never posted. I've been online for
over ten years, ran my share of mailing lists, and understand
majordomo quite well.
As far as I can tell, nobody has ever advertised or posted
instructions for joining Blossom's or Arachelian's lists. At one
time I gave a little bit of an effort to find them, to no avail.
They don't seem readily available on the search engines (again, as
of about 6 months ago).
I never did flat out post a request for the information, as it was
not that important for *me* to find it. I imagine that these
individuals might have limited resources for a list-too-large, but
is there really a reason this is request-only info?

Actually, I've been sitting on the sidelines, somewhat bemused, that
this far into online living the cypherpunks have to rehash this
themselves. I've seen this entire exchange at least three times in
the last two years. None of the lists survived. Good luck..
