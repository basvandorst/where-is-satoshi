Not everybody thinks India is a free country, but it is, more or less. The
interesting thing about "needing Stealth PGP" is that you need it more in
"free" USA, where Big Brother has the technology and political will to watch
and blacklist you, as well as the political will of Bobby Ray's ilk. Most
repressive countries are, on the other hand, not well equipped with hi-tech
In India, where I can telnet from at practically no cost due to a fairly
up to date net, official policy for this "Educational" net states
that mail, not supposed to be private, may be randomly inspected.
However, I can send just about anything I want to and from anywhere (such as
PGP, Phrack, and any sedition I might want to export), because *NOBODY WILL
BOTHER* to inspect anything. And government security agencies who may have the
technology to snoop couldn't be bothered with electronic traffic. In any case,
if I was to hack for state secrets, presumably I'd find NSA archives more
interesting than their local equivalant.
The point is that nobody here will notice what encryption I use, and far from
outlawing it, hardly anyone is aware of it. (I'm one the only person from
India, and one of four from all Asia, to subscribe to this list. Pretty well
hidden in the noise ;-)
Just as in India, I'm not suspect if I encrypt a message, Xenon hopes that the
NSA won't mind if *IT DOESN'T KNOW* that you've encrypted something. But the
threshold of suspicion will change: with increasing use of Stealth-PGP, *ANY
TRANSMISSION* of noise will be cause for honorary membership to the NSA
watchlist. Of course, they may find it harder to prove that you did encrypt
anything; but now they can't prove that you encrypted something criminal, as
decryption is pretty hard. But they don't believe much in proof, do they?

Libertarions and c*punks are the first to take advantage of new communication
technologies. Until the authorities catch on, that is... When authorities
grow aware of the power of technology for Control, Surveillance and Big Brother Watching, they behave repressively, whether in the US, or China:
Reuters news clip from The Asian Age:
BEIJING, Feb 16: Police have cracked into China's largest group of ham-radio
hackers and sent three ringleaders to labour camp for "creating chaos in the
airwaves," the official China Business Times said on Wednesday.
   The group, dubbed "Radio Air Salon" ands based in Henan province, surfed through radio channels interrupting regular broadcasts with their own conversations and illegally listening in on restricted frequencies, the newspaper said.
   "The use of technical equipment to create chaos in the airwaves and _interfere with social order_ is a new type of illegal activity," the newspaper said. It said police caught 61 members of the group, which had efectively taken over 27 radio channels.
   "At present they are all being punished, with three of the backbone elements
undergoing _RE-EDUCATION THROUGH LABOUR_," the newspaper said.

There has been some discussion over the last week about what is a 'right',

However there seems to be strong support for the right to vote in several
amendments. Apart from the lenthy 12th amendment describing the process of
electing Presidents and Vice-Presidents, there are:
Amendment XV                                           (1870)
Section 1. THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES TO VOTE shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.
Amendment XIX                                          (1920)
THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES TO VOTE shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.
Amendment XXIV                                          (1964)
Section 1. THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES TO VOTE in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.
Amendment XXVI                                         (1971)
Section 1. THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES, who are 18 years of age or older, TO VOTE, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of age.

This, and other similar methods will of course only work with GIFs; the
problem is that GIFs compress, and the loss of compression caused by adding
to the color table could be noticed, as could the fact that there are multiple
entries with the same value.
It's also somewhat more complicated for stego users to figure out where the data is - unless you use a 'standard' header or format, which is as known to
the NSA as to cypherpunks.
What worries me more about many stego methods is their assumption that 'stegging' a picture will not be noticed. I am not so sure, even if you stick to the LSB of an 8-bit blue channel of a 24-bit hi-res scan. Things like the abnormal frequency of 1s as mentioned earlier, are almost as easy to build into your stego program as to detect. I've worked a lot with
images, particularly image recognition, and have seen many surprising
similarities among pictures of some category that are human-noticable only
after considerable statistical analysis (or filtering through sophisticated
neural networks). It may well be possible to develop highly CPU-intensive
techniques that can detect, or indicate suspicion towards, 'stegged' images.
Unless, of course, equally complex stego techniques are developed, which will
probably have the extremely low message-to-image ratio of the old 'letter to
granny' codes. (Message in third letter of alternate words, etc., in innocuous, plausible letter.)
This whole cat and mouse game with the authorities reminds me of the reaction I
had to the story in Wired 2.02 on the Stealth watchers. OK, intrepid renegades
take zoom-lens photos and listen in to secret frequencies, but only because
US authorities don't REALLY mind. Come on, if Big Brother were really serious,
Phil Zimmerman (and most of us on this list) would have been shot long ago,
democracy be damned. As it so happens, PEOPLE still vote, not SPIES.

the LA Times article:
"As long as there is a thriving market in commercial cryptography, CLipper
is unlikely to be a threat to our privacy or our criminals."
Ummm... Isn't the whole govt strategy to flood the market with orders for
Clipper, ensuring that due to the economies of scale, any "thriving market"
will be for Skipjack? Besides, while the Clipper proposal may not say anything
about banning other crypto, DT-2 would force any common carriers wanting to
provide 'secure,' encrypted lines as a value addition to use Clipper, or otherwise "ensure the government agency's ability to acquire the plaintext..."
True, Clipper even if passed, will probably backfire on the govt, as the
public debate it has instigated has done more to raise awareness of other methods (PGP...) and of crypto in general, then we might have been able to do
without this provocation. Average citizen-units are likely to stick to plaintext (which is fine - they have none of the false sense of security of
Clipper users). Many people, who would like to keep their communications private but never thought of encryption before, may well end up
using non-Clipper devices due to the publicity for these due, ironically, to
Clipper. However, the government may insist that contractors and others who deal with
it use 'standard' encryption, at least for communication with the government;
presumably hoping that the substantial number of such organizations will not
bother to spend more for alternative encryption for non-governmental use.
Free, PC-based voice encryption (voice-PGP etc) may be one way to counter Clipper, though 'ordinary people' would definitely prefer transparently secure
phones. Voice-PGP would, of course, have the same patent problems within the US
as PGP itself. As an aside, a quick check showed that vanilla PGP encrypts high-entropy files
at over 20k/sec (on my 486/33 with many things in the background, excluding key-ring lookup time). As even a Codex FAST transmits high-entropy data (such
as encoded speech, or PGP output) at only 2.4 kbytes/sec, and voice can be
squeezed into about 1k/sec, PGP code, as it is at the present, is easily fast enough to cope with real-time conversation. The descriptions of voice-crypto that I've seen so far attempt to multiplex
voice into a (digital) datastream over a modem. Is anyone working on something
more general, that produces an *analog* encrypted audio stream? As voice
encryption takes an input that is originally analog, if it were to output analog noise, one could build dictaphone-like gadgets to talk through into even a Clipperphone, in the event that all instrument manufacturers were "suitably incentivized" to use only the Clipper chip.

rarachel (Arsen Ray Arachelian):
Entropy is:
 sigma(- q_i * log q_i), for all i where q_i is the frequency of token i occurring in the data stream. I don't know where I've put my old entropy program, but I cooked one up now, attached to the end of the mail.
I don't get it. OK, maybe if you see "Entropy 1.0" you may feel more secure that the white noise is white noise, but I'm sure you're using some decent generator anyway. As far as using entropy to attempt to make the input (noise)
and output (with embedded data) statistically similar goes, it's hardly enough. Entropy measure is not the most sophisticated of analysis techniques!
If the real use of WNSTORM is to modify it for stego, to put things into the
low bits, then entropy is *definitely* not a great method of ensuring that your stegoed image will be statistically similar to the original. There have
been earlier discussions on methods of ensuring that the percentage of 0s and
1s remains similar before and after stegging (I just love that verb; I steg,
you steg, he stegs, thou steggeth ;-)
I personally believe, based on my not inconsiderable experience working with
images both from the image-processing-programming and the digital-effect-touchup
points of view, that very minor changes in images tend to be noticable to the
human eye, after the right preprocessing. 'Ultimate' steganography may have to bother about very sophisticated statistical modelling, or neural networks (I know that many number theorists, and Bruce Schneier, intensely dislike the latter. They are quite useful, however, in building complex models on data with
which one may have no idea what to do).
I'm waiting for a large collection of 'before and after' stego images, to play
with them and see what I find. (I once worked on a model to recognize faces, fast, by generating a pixel-density graph of monochrome edge-outlined images.
Though the project died before the computer properly recognized a face, I could
identify faces from their 'densitographs'.)

I've noticed some discussions of IRC (Internet Relay Chat), both as a possible
model for CP interactions, as well as a location for implementations of BlackNet (in  etc.)
Note that IRC, unlike MUDS, has been designed to ensure 'true-names'. While
you do use nicknames, anyone can find out the machine name and user ID you are
logged in from, with a /whois. Anytime you join or leave a channel, your full
machine name and user ID is displayed to everyone, along with your nick. This
is different from any (possibly pseudonymous) e-mail address you register for
incoming mail.
In  people typically trade names of unauthorised FSP sites (such as the
one in the LaMacchia case), which normally remain active for less than a few weeks. Though entry to IRC channels can be by invitation only, everyone knows
everyone else's real (in the sense of machine and ID) identity.
Not CP-friendly at all. It would be nice to have a  channel, though... many of us don't mind revealing our identities to each other, and it could increase the frequency of interactive sessions greatly.

Tim May says:
Well, just as I wouldn't recommend using CASE tools without a working knowledge
of C, in case 'ducking down' to a lower level is necessary, I feel that C++ is
useful to know as a language with all the OO of, for instance, Smalltalk, and
low level capabilities too. I've programmed in many languages and taught C++,
and find that what is important for productivity is not higher-level *languages*
so much as *environments* -- Smalltalk wouldn't be much fun without one. Visual programming environments do greatly help in bridging this semantic gap.
I don't think the argument against them (slow programs) is really valid, or will
remain so for a long time. For most applications, including crypto, environments
provide optimized libraries for a number of functions. Most environments, such as Visual C++, provide for links to lower levels, allowing optimization for *really* critical routines.

Weekly column for The Asian Age by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh
 28/March/1994: Cyberbanking and Digital Cash
Intro: The currency of cyberspace will be electronic tokens that
cannot be forged.
If information wants to be free, will we still need money?
Definitely. More than ever, in fact. The reason we use money at
all, rather than barter, is because money has definite value.
Perhaps with no real value whatsoever, currency fills the role of
a reference, against which the value of goods can be measured. In
the information age, when knowledge may be the most valuable
commodity to be traded, there will be a real need for a reference
of the relative value of varying pieces of data. Note the use of
the future tense; so far, on the Internet, information has by and
large succeeded in being free. Though much of it will hopefully
remain so, with the Net's increasing commercialization, large
amounts of material are bound to become major sources of income
for data vendors.
For future-aware businesses, from small digital entrepreneurs
marketing their unique expertise to colossal database tycoons,
information is the key to high-growth industries of the next
millennium. However great the Internet era has been, with free
access to services and information, it is already becoming
something for nostalgia -- not for long will the Net remain
hugely subsidized by industrial-age economies, and information
will inevitably be entrapped once more. If activists for freedom
in cyberspace are successful, this time information will not be
caged by authority in the form of governments; but by the power
of money and corporations.
When information is distributed as a valuable commodity, the
process is quite different from goods as we traditionally think
of them. Information does not need to be manufactured for each
customer. Once created, it can be transferred with ease in an
instant. The power of information is when it is accurate and up-
to-date. It must be communicated on demand, at the time of
demand. This means that any method of payment must be instant,
and secure. Unlike mail order and other time-delayed forms of
shopping of the present, where there is no urgency to process and
verify cheques or credit card balances, the information market is
like the corner drugstore. You get instant service, and you pay
in instant (and presumably secure) cash. Cyberspace needs a means
of transferring cash across the world in an instant -- in
exchange for the data that comes electronically at the speed of
There are various experiments underway in corners of the Net
populated by concerned cybercitizens to create this means; to
create digicash. To be communicated at the speed of information,
cash must be able to travel at that speed. This leads us to an
interesting conclusion. Digital money is not just electronic
banking records, or smart debit cards; digicash must be
information. Initially backed by real money, convertible to
paper, digicash is distributed, like paper cash, in units that
can be combined, unlike cheques, where a total value is filled
into a form. These tokens of information are unique (enumerating
each digital 'banknote'), and are generated using techniques
similar to those used in public-key cryptography. The
mathematically generated tokens can be matched with their issuing
bank, ensuring through digital signatures that they are genuine.
Unlike conventional signatures or watermarks, new notes cannot be
forged -- it would take a roomful of supercomputers several
centuries to break through the complex mathematics involved in
ensuring the uniqueness of signed tokens.
Being information, though, these tokens of cash can be simply
copied. Note that with paper money, all banknotes are (excepting
the serial number) virtually identical. The protection against
forgery is that it is difficult to duplicate a single note. With
digicash, a single note can easily be duplicated; but all notes
are significantly different. The signatures can be authenticated,
ensuring that a note is definitely from the signing bank. This
implies that invalid notes cannot be created; a forged digital
banknote has to be an exact copy of a real one. The protection
against this elementary type of forgery is that transactions are
in real-time; between customer and seller, and between seller and
bank. The bank ensures in that the cash is genuine, and will only
honour one copy of any token. As all digicash transactions are
done this way, there will only be one copy of any token in use at
any time. For the sake of privacy, these transactions, whether
through smartcards, on-line access or e-mail, will be anonymous.
Digicash will be like real cash. The methods of anonymity planned
so far do include exceptions whereby double-spending, attempting
to use a token more than once, will greatly reduce anonymity,
making forgery more difficult.
Digicash systems are currently in experimental use. They work.
The only problems are the authorities and the law, who are, as
usual, well behind the times.

ph (Peter Hendrickson):
This is getting closer to a possible working reputation system:
Anyone can post their opinion of a particular message, using some standardized
grading system, onto the list. These 'grading' posts refer to the 'graded' posts _without_ including the body of the messages. This reference could be
to the message id, for instance. The reader's mail software understands 'grading' posts and extracts the grade
for any actual post to the same list. The 'grading' posts are not shown to the
reader; their votes are attached to the other posts, allowing the reader to decide whether or not to read a particular post based on the attached grades of
Readers can create their own weightages for the opinions of graders.
As anyone can be a grader, a reader has the option of receiving a weighted grade from a large sample of the list. Every grader doesn't then have to look post in detail - presumably each post will be read carefully by at least _one_
of them.
Grades can, over time, transform into reputations of the posters themselves, at
least as far as legible writing is concerned ;)
Bugs: the time lag between graders and readers. This might get averaged out over
a number of posts; the "bulk" priority causes delays in any case. Besides, I've
noticed that posts tend to get answered or thought about within 2-3 days, rather
than instantly.

@_subject: Why dumb criminals will NOT use Clipper 
How to shoot yourself in the foot, or why "stupid" criminals won't use Clipper
Harshad Mehta, a Bombay stock broker who was behind a multi-billion dollar
financial scam involving a number of international banks and the Indian stock
markets, was definitely smart. He hired one of the most well-known lawyers in
the country, but encrypted his personal records with Lotus 1-2-3 (though I believe that he had used DES for some things).
The Medellin cartel, presumably used to the methods of US intelligence agencies,
caused the assassination of Pablo Escobar by making cellular calls without
encryption. They had the money, organization and intelligence, but were either unaware of
any need for encryption, or assumed that what was good for most US businesses (DES) was good enough for them.
When the NSA wanted to provide an improved PK standard for governmental use, the
thing to do would have been to layer some weak PK system over a weak DES. Like
DES itself, this system would be so weak as to _not require_ key escrows.
Everyone who uses DES (including "smart" criminals) would shift to this more convenient, but still cryptographically weak system. Most criminals would
continue not to encrypt at all, and criticism, as with DES, would be limited to mathematical journals.
By creating an encryption standard strong enough to require escrow, the NSA has
successfully sabotaged this wiretap enabling situation. Key escrow is something
lay people who can't spell "cryptographically strong" can understand. The high
profile negative reporting on Clipper has greatly increased public perception
of the need for, and understanding of the types of encryption. After reading
these articles, if Pablo Escobar were still around, he _would_ be using encryption, and _not_ Clipper.
Before Clipper (B.C. ;) even "smart" criminals would happily use weak cryptography. Now, _really_ dumb criminals will continue, as always, to communicate in plaintext; the not-so-dumb who think of encryption at all
(because of all those your-data-is-insecure stories) will know enough about it
to avoid Clipper like the plague.
Funny, I'd have thought the cloak-and-daggers familiar with Sun Tzu's advice
against frontal, visible attack. They could have got away with a weak alternative to DES. Too lazy to spend time cracking code, greedy to "have all
the keys" (yum yum), they've shot themselves in their collective foot.

Weekly column for The Asian Age by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh
 16/May/1994: I e-mail, therefore I am
When you read what I write, do you know whether I exist? Do you
know who I am? Do I know who I am?
Well, you know my name. You assume that I am a real person of
that name, and that someone at this newspaper has contact with
me. (In fact I file my column electronically, though I admit to
have been seen on occasion!) Despite technological advances,
people still start professional (or other) relationships after
acquiring verifiable identification -- an address, a bank
account, a face. What would happen in cyberspace, where people
may be far apart geographically, and identities less rigid and
Electronic identities as widely used, are limited to e-mail
addresses. As with a physical address, an e-mail address provides
a way to contact an individual. Like the postmark stamped on tree-
murdering paper envelopes, e-mail headers generally indicate that
a message has, indeed, come from a particular address and hence a
particular person. Unfortunately these headers are easily forged.
Not only can someone pretend to be me, I can pretend to be
someone who doesn't exist!
Cybernauts see two issues here. The inherent insecurity of
cyberspace, which makes normal interactions unreliable, is a
lapse that demands attention. On the other hand, the amorphous
nature of identity that the Net encourages is actually a Good
Thing, balancing the ease with which privacy can be violated, and
making the advantages of an information society apparent.
There are a number of ways to ensure distinct identities. That
is, to ensure that Rishab Ghosh who writes this column is the
author of the previous episode. Digital signatures are secure,
backed by the arcane mathematics that proves the difficulty of
factoring large numbers. A digital signature is a very large
number, correlating the signed data with other publicly available
numbers that define an individual's identity. Though these
identifying numbers are public, a signature cannot be forged, as
it also depends on a private key kept secret by the individual.
Similar methods can be used by anyone to send encrypted messages
that can be read only by the intended recipient.
There -- now I have an electronic identity. You might have
noticed, though, that there is no link at all between an identity
in cyberspace and any physical (real?) one. I could plausibly
have multiple identities, for different purposes, conducting
public arguments with each other. Which brings us to the Good
Thing. There's no reason why I shouldn't write columns as Rishab
Ghosh and poetry as Alfred Prufrock, while living the rest of my
life as John Doe. I might have to, lest evil marketing managers
monitor all my public actions and learn more about me than I do.
To formalize this separation of identities, cybernauts have
created services known as anonymous remailers, which accept
conventional e-mail and repost them, shorn of all their direct
identifying marks -- addresses, names and so on. It is up to the
poster to create pseudonymous identities using signatures and
other methods. There are varying degrees of anonymity provided;
with many services it is even possible to reply to anonymous mail
without knowing a 'real' e-mail address.
This sort of anonymity might primarily be used for privacy --
from consumer surveys, cloak-and-dagger maniacs, and other
assorted net pests. In an ideal world, we would be free to say
what we like; till we are, anonymity allows us some freedom to
express without reprisal. This freedom is already being taken
advantage of; in Internet news groups such as
alt.sexual.abuse.recovery, for instance, victims can comfort each
other in public electronic gatherings without the risk of public
As with any technological advance, anonymity can be abused. While
'whistle blowing' might be the right thing to do sometimes, there
is no way to be compensated for anonymous defamation. Attempts
are being made towards a system of reputations, where people
would gradually build (or ruin) a reputation for their
identities, as their posts are tested by time. A totally
anonymous accusation will of course have a very low reputation.
Reputation systems will not end identity abuse. Hopefully, as
people depend on them to be taken seriously, and unsubstantiated
accusations are taken with large helpings of salt, we will enter
a more tolerant society, that concentrates on the expressions
rather than the expressor.

The two basic reasons for anonymity, as I see it, are:
1. freedom of expression
2. freedom from analysis, i.e. context-based 'profiling' by companies or    governments, based on your non-anonymous posts.
In an ideal world one would have the freedom to express without any risk of
damage, whether it be economic, material or social. Ideally, I should be able
to publicly discuss my views, on anarchy or religion or sadism or whatever, without risking social censure. In an ideally tolerant society, the need for
anonymity would then be reduced to (2), freedom from analysis.
Unfortunately our society is far from ideal. Though Unicorn could freely post
on the relatively more tolerant Net, he still faces intolerance in the 'real' For all we may talk about reputation systems, multiple identities and so on,
the seven-digit possible loss Unicorn talks about is _real_, in a way cyberspace just isn't, yet.
Suppose tmp _had_ posted through chains of remailers? The damage would have been just as real; the remedy would have been far less. Would, and should, remailer operators facing such a situation 'open up'? Uni says Julf would disable tmp though Netcom didn't, Julf understands netiquette. Maybe, but
it's not that easy to disable an account through a chain of cypherpunk-style
I remember when we discussed the Usenet libel case in Australia, someone (Tim?)
said that anonymous posts, and libellious posts in general, should not be
taken that seriously. Uni's business associates are not likely to be so familiar with net culture, and would not understand the anonymous part of it,
just the slight (from their perspective) on Uni's character.
Of course, Uni should have posted everything through a chain of remailers himself, if he was concerned about his views leaking out of the Net. Does
that mean he'd never be able to attend cypherpunk meetings, or have truename
contact with anyone, lest he be identified with his anonymously held opinions?
If tmp, or anyone else for that matter, were to suspect that Uni was behind
specific anon posts, he'd just make that accusation anonymously, in 100 news
groups. Libel doesn't have to be proven to be damaging.
What I find amusing is that Detweiler was the one who started going nuts while
making paranoid warnings about the dangers of anonymity, such as in libel.
He seems bent on proving his predictions correct, as many of the recent examples of identity abuse (tm) were instigated by him. (Of course, by this I'm
not saying that Detweiler's views are reflected in tmp's posts... ;-)

Patent it yourself. Or publish extensively, with source code, etc. In the
US, where patents are still invent-first rather than file-first, this will make it harder for someone else to patent it. If you publish it, it can be

As far as I know, RSA/PKP patents are for _algorithms_, not respected outside

I'm not sure how algorithm patents can be applied to hardware -- you may or may not be able to sell this chip in the US _without_ violating patents. (Though you can freely sell RSA hardware or software outside the US.)
You may even be able to apply for a European patent for the hardware, which
would then be respected everywhere, except in the US where it may be superceded
by the algorithm patents.

A recent article from the Daily Telegraph, another British paper, went on about
the possible encryption techniques used by the Russians. It described how reused one-time pads led to the unmasking of Fuchs, the Rosenbergs, Philby et al. Then it suggested that the method the NSA broke was based on (presumably
weak) PRNGs, a stream cipher. It suggested that the NSA might have developed techniques to find patterns in PRNG outputs through neural networks, or genetic
While the latter sounds like crap to me, even though I've worked with and believe in the power of neural networks for amazing pattern recognition, unless
the PRNGs were _really_ weak, I'm skeptical. I don't think the Russians are fools, and in these times one doesn't rely on secret weak algorithms for crypto, not when there are publicly well known strong ones. Humint? Maybe.

@_subject: BBS anonymity policy 
Commercial net providers or BBSes usually don't bother much about anonymity.
A user may want anonymity on a BBS for three reasons:    1. to avoid harassment, or avoid situations like Unicorn's where the       'outside world' gets to know your electronic views
   2. to avoid being included in statistics - though most BBSes need statistics       for charging or whatever
   3. to do something either illegal, or provocative to legal action, such as
      tmp's. BBS providers are unlikely to condone or want to protect such       users.
A simple way to provide anonymity for (1) is used by a BBS I'm co-sysop of.
Everyone's identity is scrupulously recorded, for billing purposes. Users can create any number of identities for the purposes of posting or receiving mail,
and no corelation between these pseudonyms and real ones is available to other
users. For administration purposes, all pseudonyms for real names are available
to sysops.

@_author: _I_ don't. 
@_subject: Crime and punishment in cyberspace - 1 of 3 
Uhh. When I started this thread with "Cyberspace is by nature crime-free," I
meant crime as what at least _I_ perceive as morally wrong enough to justify
the intervention of society as a whole, usually represented by functionaries
of the state - police, judiciary, etc.; and NOT what may or not be wrong in the eyes of existing law, which as we all know, is an ass.
Unless we want a totally "everyone for him/herself" society (which is contradictory - society is a framework or protocol by which individuals interact with each other), and become like Rwanda, say, we need the intervention of [police/state/society/collective] to ensure that basic social
agreements are kept - thou shalt not rape, for instance. Even anarchist Tim May
has in previous posts conceded the possible need for a police force to investigate murders.
Now to cyberspace...
I greatly believe in the Internet as a model for society. While there are incompatibilities between a society on cyberspace and one on the streets, what
is needed is an adaption of cybersociety to the "real world" NOT vice versa.
Out of all 'crimes' listed in previous posts by Matthew Gream and others, the
only one I accept as possibly requiring society intervention in the information
age is that of intellectual property. The extent of such intervention is debatable. I will summarize my attitude to the other points with this: saying that cracking an ordinary Unix system is fraud is like saying that walking into a field protected perhaps by a tattered hedge is 'breaking in.'
Unless you want a nanny state, you have to protect yourself, and your rights.
Unless you want a jungle, you have to accept intervention by agents of the society you live in, when protection is far to difficult for an individual.
You expect police help to catch a murderer. You don't expect police help to
catch someone who stole money that fell out of your torn pocket. (_I_ don't.)

@_subject: Crime and punishment in cyberspace - 2 of 3 
The way police can help protect against murders is to patrol the streets.
The way police can help identify fraud on cyberspace is Clipper.
If you demand protection from society against cyberspace fraud, you accept
society's right to violate someone's privacy. You have to also accept their
right to violate _yours_.
Just as in brickspace (I'm getting sick of calling it the 'real world') you
try to protect yourself, _first_, and when it is socially recognized as not
possible or very difficult, the police comes in...
   Are you going to expect the police to protect you against rude language?
   No, you protect yourself by ignoring it.
   Are you going to expect the police to protect you against broken promises?
   No, it's your own failed judgement, or luck. Or you'd have a formal contract.
   Are you going to expect the police to protect you against terrorist bombs?
   I would; that's a full-time job that I'm paying them for.
In cyberspace too, where you can protect yourself with available tools - encryption, authentication and the other protocols we discuss here, you should
not expect police help. You should _refuse_ it. Alternatively, you should give
them the power to help you; the power to listen in to 'criminals'; the power
to identify conspiracies through communication route tracing. Sounds familiar?

@_author: eg. digital encryption 
@_subject: Crime and punishment in cyberspace - 3 of 3 
All this brings us to a related issue - another one hinging on principles:
Do cypherpunks accept the need for wiretapping?
Wiretapping is necessary to solve many 'crimes'. If we accept that these crimes
are important enough to justify wiretapping, than there is little difference
between wiretapping analog phones and tapping data.
The EFF and other organizations have pursued the laudable goals of extending
laws guaranteeing freedom of expression, privacy etc to cyberspace, adapting them, as and where necessary, to the nature and technology of digital networks.
It is only to be expected that the FBI, theoretically a socially agreed upon body enforcing laws made by socially agreed upon legislators, to attempt to extend the powers granted to it for wiretapping to cyberspace. _Adapting them,
as and where necessary (eg. digital encryption), to the nature and technology
of digital networks.
If we accept the need for wiretapping, than the only problem is to find a way
to make Clipper/DTII as protective of privacy as current analog-tapping laws;
as inconvenient as current analog tapping. If we accept the need for wiretapping, we can find such ways. Variants of Micali's fair crypto; an open,
publicly available no-trapdoor algorithm; a requirement that, as with primitive
exchanges, DTII'd ones would still have to be visited by LEOs to work a tap,
etc. We can then respond to the various (non-serious) calls from Freeh, Denning
et al for an 'alternative'.
Or else, if wiretapping per se does more harm to privacy than it does to crime,
call for an end to wiretapping altogether.
There is an anecdote about George Bernard Shaw (or Bertrand Russell?):
At a social event, he hypothetically asks the lady next to him whether she

about the price."

Digital neural networks can't do _anything_  that cannot be done by algorithms; they run on Turing machines too. Why neural networks are 'magical' as Perry says, in certain classes of problems, is that they provide a way to
perform complex algorithmic funtions through a relatively simple interface
to humans.
In any case, how "fuzzy" do you allow your relative magnitude function to be?
Even if a function exists that compares keys with a magnitude difference of
the order of 100 bits, it's useless. For your binary search method to work,
this comparator function would have to be accurate when the difference is on
the order of just 1 bit. Yeah, quantum computers ;-)

tcmay (Timothy C. May):
The secret key is _encrypted_ with the passphrase. Strength of PGP with a
known secret keyFILE, not key, and unknown passphrase, is the strength of the
cipher used to encrypt the secret key with. In this case, the strength of IDEA.
Of course, your pass phrase is as susceptible to dictionary attack as your UNIX
password, and it would be easier to decrypt a message by decrypting through such attacks or brute force your keyfile, than to factor large numbers to get at your session key.
RSA would have a tough time using a 11 char English phrase as an exponent ;-)
To quote from the PGP manual:
     PGP also asks for a "pass phrase" to protect your secret key in case
     it falls into the wrong hands.       Nobody can use your secret key file without this pass phrase.            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I see governments as representing the collective will of society, responsible for only those things that are best achieved through everyone's cooperation.
It is now fashionable to talk about the Asian way -- subjugating freedom to
prosperity. This is of course bunkum, freedom is an ideal and is universal. The
way to get to that may differ from society to society, particularly, as Michael
says, in poor nations. It isn't necessary to have a strong state to survive;
India, with a similar standard of living in 1950, has been democratic with
more or less regular, free and fair elections. Contrary to popular perception,
India has been no more 'socialist' than many European countries such as France,
with stockmarkets and large state-owned enterprises. It is naturally more
difficult to control crime or rising population here than in China, where petty
thieves and corrupt officials are frequently executed.
Freedom is a right equally applicable everywhere, whatever the political, social
or economic situation. Any technology that promotes it is important for the
whole world.

The Internet patent news service has some interesting stuff on an internal
battle between PK Partners. The full text of the suits filed by Cylink and
RSADSI is 30k, so I'm not posting it here.
    Other patents involved are held by the consortium Public Key Partners
(PKP) of Sunnyvale, California.  Well as it turns out, members of PKP are now
suing each other (isn't patenting fun :-).  One member, Cylink (Sunnyvale) is
suing another member, RSA Data Security (Redwood City, CA) over RSA's use of
some MIT technology (MIT also being a member of PKP, along with Stanford).
Cylink filed suit in June, and the squabble could lead to the break up of
PKP, which will either simplify or complicate the use of their technology in
the government's DSS digital signature standard.
    For many years, there has been an ongoing controversy in the cryptogrpahy
field dealing with patents.  At the heart of these matters is a patent awarded
to Diffie and Hellman while at Stanford, which along with a few other patents,
make up the portfolio for which PKP defends and is affecting US Government
activities with digital signature standards.
    Someone has filed a lawsuit challenging these patents, partly on the
grounds that Diffie and Hellman talked about their ideas in public before
they applied for the patents, and thereby forfeited their patent rights.
    What follows is a copy of the complaint as filed in court.  The complaint
is interesting as an example of such documents, as well as being good grounds
to have some or all of the patents overturned.

@_author: without contradicting the rules? 
@_subject: Governing an information society - 1/4 
Jason W Solinsky :
Yes, I can imagine heated debates on the moralities of such cyberspatial
death penalties.
I like to believe that the Internet model of society and indeed 'government'
will eventually be adopted in the mainstream. What does one really need
a 'government' for? A central source of power, Max Weber's monopoly of
legitimate violence, is surely not the only method of ensuring a degree of
fairness and order in society. Especially not in one based primarily on
knowledge - or information.
What do real world governments do? Broadly, two things. 'Social upliftment' - welfare and development programmes; and 'law enforcement' - ensuring that
people stick to what they've agreed upon (idealized: in theory citizens have
agreed to the social contract present in the constitution and laws).
There is no specific evidence to show that the task of social upliftment is
best performed by those with the weapons to enforce laws. Indeed, where
welfare is _really_ needed (and I'm not talking about a Swede on unemployment
benefits) much of it comes even today from independent organizations. Bangladesh, for instance, has what is almost a parallel government of several
hundred local and international agencies that run numerous development projects, funded largely by private monies. Grameen Bank, a cooperative
started on the premise that poor village women need small ($100) loans but
invariably pay back, has a minute loan failure rate and makes a decent profit,
unlike numerous government projects the world over. Development, the primary
justification for taxation, is probably better accomplished by people outside
the government, who are likely to be more efficient and dedicated. And if they
manage with private donations now, they are sure to flourish when there is
no compulsory taxation. Most cultures encourage generousity and most people would be willing to invest small parts of their income in organizations that
do social work, where they could have far more control as investors than they do currently as taxpayers.
ps. food for thought: there are seven countries on this planet that allow
the death penalty for crimes committed by minors: Libya, Sudan, Iraq, Iran,
Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United States of America.

@_date: 1994-08-21 13:56:28
@_author: or are conditioned to be? 
@_subject: Governing an information society - 2/4 
Another thing that governments do that is not quite the same 'social upliftment' as welfare - build roads, bridges and so on - is already done
in many countries by private, profitable ventures with little loss to society.
Law enforcement: there are instances where you break your contract, that
form the basis of most crimes from non-payment to larceny to even theft, which can be seen as a violation of a social contract to 'pay for what you take'; then there are things which even the most radical would consider plain wrong, such as murder or rape. This distinction is partially acknowledged in the difference between civil and criminal cases.
The former, 'civil' cases are best sorted out by an independent and trusted
judiciary; a 'government' doesn't, or shouldn't, interfere.
In the latter, 'criminal' cases, there may be a need for some sort of 'authorised violence' such as a police force. This is the only part of
government that might necessarily require a universally accepted power. The
alternative is the utopian, where people are (or are conditioned to be?) too 'good' to become murderers; or the dystopian (as in cyberpunk fiction, or the
Wild West for that matter) ruled by the law of the jungle - might is right.
Note that this differs from the present situation where while it is true that
the power of authority rests in its right to violence, this is in theory
approved of by the people - a sort of 'right is might'.

@_author: or raped or have my arm minced or whatever 
@_subject: Governing an information society - 3/4 
Violence of action requires the protection and violence of action in return.
Violence of belief requires the freedom to believe differently.
It definitely should not require violence or protection of _action_ in return.
Having dispensed with the role of traditional government in the area of
social development and civil law :-} what remains is the need for a police
force to tackle murders. If I'm murdered (or raped or have my arm minced or whatever), it is physically
damaging. I suppose I'd say the same of my house being bombed. I need protection from such things, and the sort of socially accepted protection that
won't lead to riots or the law of the jungle. Barricading myself, carrying
a Kalashnikov and learning aikido is not enough, not for a civilized society.
So I concede the existence of the police. (There is another reason - it is
usually practical for the police to trace murderers or arsonists).
In cyberspace, there is a 'social upliftment' role. Though initially paid for
by various governments, there are a number of organizations that manage to
distribute costs efficiently and provide huge service and infrastructure for
low rates.
There may also be 'civil' suits in cyberspace. Due to digitally signed, undeniable contracts, these should be reduced to only those that involve a
breach of contract, rather than a suspicion of invalidity. 'Civil' cases can be sorted out by a cyberjudiciary, and punishment efficiently enforced
by a society without any central control. While there have probably been
no civil cases on the Net in the traditional sense, there have been situations
where the power of distributed control was apparent. For instance, when
Richard Depew's ARMM went out and cancelled anon posts on USENET, there was
universal outrage. His punishment required no central 'law enforcer' - it was
just the threat of posts from his site being cancelled that did it. And this
would not have been possible without general, widespread agreement with the
'verdict' - as anyone not enforcing it would risk similar punishment from
the large majority.

@_author: thoughtcrime 
@_subject: Governing an information society - 4/4 
Real crime on cyberspace? The analogy to violence of action, such as murder, is violence of data, the fabric of cyberspace. This may have many forms:
belief or opinions, knowledge, information and data crime.
Violence of belief (thoughtcrime) - while some people feel that to discuss rape is to perform it, and discussing crimes is subject to a range of conspiracy and riot-control laws worldwide, this really can't be a crime in
any free society.
Then there is the knowledge crime - theft of intellectual property. This is in my view the single biggest issue in an information economy, but it can be addressed by a combination of encryption technologies, to prevent 'unauthorised' access, and the decentralized, non-governmental civil system discussed previously.Intellectual property can in any case not be treated quite as land and bonds are, and there are practical and moral issues involved in just what it is, which I may talk about in the future.
Information crime - 'unauthorised' access of other information such as
mail, unreleased memoirs etc, is basically an issue of privacy and can only
be practically addressed through technology.
Data crime - 'cracking', 'phreaking' etc usually reflect a total lack of responsibility on the part of _administrators_. "Officer, I left my wallet
on the kerb 10 minutes ago, and now it's gone!" Better security and greater
awareness will prevent most of it. If you do happen to catch a cracker, go
through the same old _civil_ system. It is not really practical for a central
Thought Police to actually find data criminals, without huge and non-specific
violations of privacy. And data criminals don't need to be put in jail, they
are probably the most affected by 'cyberdeath' - disconnection, digicash
accounts cancelled, reputations muddied. I wouldn't want to do that to _anyone_
actually ;^)
A thread I started months ago ('Cyberspace is by nature crime free' / 'Crime
and punishment in cyberspace') led to similar Tim May-ist conclusion - let
the police (and the minimalist government) attend to murders in brickspace,
we cybercitizens will look after ourselves.

@_subject: Taxation and participatory democracy 
Tim May:
Of course taxes were originally meant to be payment for services (at least in democracies - even US taxes are not quite the same as the half-your-crop
exploits of kings and modern despots). Taxes were to be compulsory where the
services were, to - it's difficult to say that you don't need the police, or
the roads, when you live in a community where you do benefit from them in any
case. The same is true for basic amenities (sewage, water...) in countries
that have a government monopoly on such things.
With the ever-increasing complexity of governments, the taxes you pay have
been far removed from the use they are finally put to, and a tax-payer's involvement in the decision of their use is remote (or non-existent, in the
case of secret defense or intelligence budgets). There have been occasional
suggestions that the use of taxes should be specified at the time of payment,
rather as one can do with donations to many charities.
Most economists think such hypothecated taxes impractical. So does The Economist - in "Taxing credulity" (August 20-26) it says that, while compelling,
such taxes are unworkable in practise and result in increased public spending.
Basically the problem is that changes in allocation of monies cannot be made
fast enough, the reason why we have _representative_ democracy rather than
_participatory_ democracy with universal involvement. I saw a good article
some years ago in Telecomputing (?) magazine on how electronic networking could
change things.
As I outlined in some posts last week, the _necessity_ of government (as we
experience it today, against highly distributed Internet-style administration)
is doubtful. Taxation is but a pinhole in the colander of its flaws. However,
the alternative comes from a cyberspace just 0.5% of the world's population.
Change is hardly likely to come soon.

If someone did an operation count of Brands' digicash protocol, I wouldn't

latter has the overhead of transaction management - but the table lookup of
databases is much simpler than modular exponentiation.
Then there's the 'loose change' problem - one I haven't seen discussed too
much. It seems that Bob will have to total up whatever he received from
Alice and anyone else, then have notes _reissued_ from the bank in his
chosen denominations - otherwise Bob could double-spend _Alice_'s cash,
exposing her identity and getting away scot-free himself. The loose change
is in choosing the note denominations - you don't have to go to a bank to
change a 100 in 'real life'. Compare this with paper money. Cash has to be printed. Granted this is cheap,
particularly with US Dollars, probably the easiest currency to forge. (Even
Indian Rupees are gravure printed in multiple colours and textures. I was really laughing at the discussion here a while ago on how easy it is to pull out the metal strip from dollars - Rupees have metal woven in to the paper, which reflects light at an angle and is opaque, black, when seen through). Then there's the overhead of distribution, the 'loose change' - how
many suitcase-fulls to buy a Boeing?
Cheques (drafts, cards) are much simpler. There is a one-time overhead of
customer verification when you get your account. Transaction-time verification
is relatively simple. The additional overhead of transaction record management
is easily implemented even in existing electronic systems.
If it weren't for Cypherpunks, anonymous cash would die a natural death as
money gets wired. Anon cash _is_ value added. And I don't see why there shouldn't be a market. We have least 700 already ;-)

"Force" is not necessarily physical and cannot be equated solely with the
monopoly over guns. This whole thing started in the context of governance in
cyberspace. In cyberspace, if you loose your net connection, right to post,
read whatever, you're dead. You could be 'killed' by a coalition of system
providers, or a 'government monopoly'. You _will_ follow the rules, won't you?
The point of this discussion was a model government for cyberspace (and here
the sense of 'governance' is administration), and its possible extension to
brickspace. It is not true that cyberspace is invincible, that the Net can't
be tamed and all that rot. The Internet cannot be censored as long as a part
of it exists. The money, power and intention could destroy it completely, which would of course be foolish in the extreme. Assuming that it survives,
'untamed', how is it to be run, and how will it affect the way the rest of our
lives are run?

India and the Russian company, Glavkosmos, suggested that the reasons were commercial rather than defence, as such engines are useless in ballistic missiles due to their lengthy preparation period, while an Indian GSLV would
pose major competition to the US space industry. Russia backed down after Yeltsin's arm was twisted so hard that he negated a personal statement he made

Recently the Defence Research and Development Organization made a secure phone
for commercial (non-defence) use. It has yet to reach the market, and I am in
the process of finding out what technology it uses, but if Clipper passes in the US, India could be pressurized into abandoning it in favour of a Clipper-like alternative.
As an aside, the Indian government likes to show that it's not following US orders (not signing the NPT etc) and the GSLV will probably be launched with

To all Certified Citizen-Units,
We are most disappointed to inform you of the sad fate of a bright young
Citizen-Unit, James A Donald. Citizen-Unit Donald has fallen prey to the
increasingly common disease of incorrect thinking. He has actually suggested
the possibility that this august and universally respected Board be replaced
with what he calls a 'reputation' system. In his system, Citizen-Units would
not be Certified by a central Board of Credentials, but would actually have
'reputations' - semi-certificates of approval by each Citizen-Unit. These
reputations would be independent of any group of Citizen-Units, and would represent the trust placed by _individual_ Units in the recipient. In such a
system, a wrong-thinking Unit may have a bad reputation with most people, but
a good one with others!
This suggestion seems dangerously close to pre-civilization tribal society,
and makes the insupportable assumption that a Citizen-Unit knows what is best
for itself. As we all know, any individual's opinions are hopelessly inadequate
when compared with the Collective, as expressed by this Board. It is hoped that
other Units will keep themselves away from such incorrect attitudes.
Citizen-Unit Donald shall henceforth be treated as De-Certified.

Social punishment 1/3: law without enforcers
I live in a country where many laws are simply not followed. As laws are always behind the times, this can lead to an environment that,
ignoring laws, follows the times. (For example due to no legal precedents
there is theoretically no electronic privacy and all my mail is read. This
is not, in practice the case - if my mail is indeed read, then it's probably
by the NSA).
When the legal system is lax, society falls back on age-old methods of keeping
order - a system of taboos and 'social' punishment such as ostracization. In
small tribes or villages ostracization is the most passive of punishments -
indeed by definition it implies _non_-cooperation or having _nothing_ to do
with a person. It is also the most powerful, often better for the society than
capital punishment which simply gets rid of a person who might be useful if
following the rules.
Of course societies that continue to use 'social' punishment do so to enforce
antideluvian values (don't talk to those people, don't engage in pre/extra-
marital or deviant sex, etc). This is not the fault of the system of social
punishment, rather that of the society itself. The system of social punishment can easily be adapted to educated, liberal
inhabitants of cyberspace, much more easilty than can present law enforcement
systems. My next post will examine the similarities between tribal and
cyberspatial society.

Social punishment 2/3: communication societies
If one examines the use of social punishment, one sees that that it is strongest in the smallest of units (a family - 'if you do that again, we won't
talk to you') and while best seen as a way of keeping order in small villages or tribes, is gradually replaced by more formal legal systems, with some form
of judiciary, police and prison as populations gather in towns and cities.
Social punishment also works best with non-lethal 'crimes' rather than murder
and rape, presumably more common in cities than in villages (or cyberspace).
It has been argued that cities need formal legal systems due to the complex
situations created by a large, concentrated population. More people means more
people who don't know (and therefore trust) each other, and leads to more
crime. Taboo and other social punishment can't work because the people are not
as strongly bound together as in a smaller community.
This may be partially true. I would say, however, that the primary reason that
social punishment works in a village is that it is a _communication society_.
People depend on each other (rather than on faceless municipal corporations or
public utilities) for most activities. Most of all, they depend on each other
to _talk_ - for social interaction. Social interaction is a far more important
component of life in a village than in a big city. It is because of this greater need for communication, rather than the size of the population, that
ostracization is so effective.
Cyberspace is also a communication society. While McLuhan's Global Village
has become extremely cliched, in this aspect cyberspace does resemble a village. People on the Net may not be dependent on each other for food and clothing, but they are for almost anything else concerned with a cyber life.
There is thankfully no Internet Municipal Corporation that takes care of all
roads (net connections), supplies (of information and public keys), and order (through centralized credentials or certification). Most would be repelled at
the thought of such a thing.
Cyberspace is full of vibrant communities that do little else but talk. Social
interaction is at a higher level than at any time in history. The 'crimes' committed in cyberspace are non-lethal and primarily violations of protocol.
Like the other communication society, the tribe or village, cyberspace is well
suited to a system of social punishment. It's not as if taboos and ostracization don't already exist in cyberspace, to
keep people within the few unwritten rules that exist at present. Flames,
newbies, kill files etc. As a variety of activities take place in cyberspace,
from digital cash transfers to elections to escrow, the number of rules will
grow, but there is no reason why the system of punishment cannot be equally
No, I'm not saying that you can solve electronic fraud by putting a name in
your kill file. More recent technologies - cancelbots, reputation systems
(in concept if not in fact) - can make social punishment in cyberspace highly practical.
And in cyberspace, if noone reads your posts, you're dead.

Social punishment 3/3: reputation systems
Social punishment works because individuals know that someone has broken
rules, and _voluntarily_ cooperate with enforcing the accused's punishment.
(Of course part of the reason is the risk of similar punishment for non-cooperation, but a major part, particularly in cybercrimes, is that
if an individual could harm someone else, he or she could harm you too.)
Social punishment works through reputation. XXX, after breaking rules, is
seen to be a 'bad character'. Soon everyone knows XXX as a 'bad character' and
behaves accordingly, usually by avoiding contact. Once XXX gets a bad REPUTATION (and this is how _I_ define the term, not as some centrally imposed
certificate), in traditional societies it is very difficult for XXX to regain
a good one. People _individually_ decide whether a 'bad character' is indeed 'bad' and depending on the stature of the individual and the bad character, may or may not cooperate with any punishment. A priest in traditional society
or someone else with impeccable reputation is permitted to interact with even
the worst of characters.
One problem with such a wildfire reputation system is it can be _too_ effective. Once ostracized, the decentralized system makes it very difficult
for someone to rejoin society, to have his/her 'reformation' recognized. The
channels in traditional societies include lots of 'good work' and recommendation by 'good citizens' such as the priest etc. The other is a new
The most powerful illustration of a reputation system I can think of is Victor
Hugo's Les Miserables, where ex-convict Jean Valjean finds himself ostracized
by society despite having been released. A priest's kindness is not enough, and
he later gains a very good reputation building an industry. The notable thing
is that he rejoins society only when he gets a _new identity_ - and later gets
back into prison when his old identity is discovered. This is a strong case for universal pseudonymity - BAN TRUE NAMES - which,
together with strong voluntary reputation and social punishment systems can
form the basis for cyberspatial order.
I can't really say as yet how a cyberspace reputation system should be
implemented. Old-timers will recognize the distinction between my proposed
voluntary reputation and certification - the difference between PGP and central
public key directories.

                              ====================
                          Internet Patent News Service
                                 September 1994
                           PATENT TITLES EMAIL SERVER
                              search
     The Internet Patent News Service is pleased to announced the availability
of the Patent Titles email server, where people can retrieve lists of patent
titles dating back to 1970 for any USPTO class/subclass, and patent numbers for additional patents dating back to the 1800's.  The Patent Titles email
server is the first step in our efforts to make the entire USPTO APS patent
text database system accessible over the Internet.
     Approximately one gigabyte of data has been prepared and attached to the
Internet.  As all of the equipment and network access is borrowed, I am
limiting access to an email server until I get a better feel for demand for
the data, and until I can raise funding to set up a proper Internet server.
     Unless the bandwidth and processing load overwhelms the equipment I am
borrowing, the service will be free.
     To use the email server, send requests to the Internet address:
                              search
using any of the following commands sent as text in the body of the email
        SENDTO  account-name
                This command is mandatory of all requests and is where you
                specify the email address you want the information sent to.
                Occasionally From: lines in email addresses do not provide
                a correct return address (at least in my experience doing
                the Internet Patent News Service).
        SEND INTRO
        SEND HELP
                Either of these commands will return this message.
        SEND UCLASSES
                This command will return an index to the approximately 400
                patent classes that are currently being used, for example:
                       Class: 69     Leather Manufacturers
        SEND UCLASS XXX
                This command will return that section of the USPTO's Manual
                of Classification covering patent class XXX.  For example,
                the command "SEND CLASS 69" would return a list of all of
                the subclasses in Class 69 by number and title.  These files
                range in size from 5K to 120K.  What follows is a section
                of Class 69:
                              Subclass  Subclass
                              Number    Title

                                1.5     .Belt-stretching
                                3       .Horse collar shaping
                                4       .Horse collar stuffing
        SEND UCLASS COMPUTING
                This command will return those sections of the USPTO's Manual
                of Classification covering patent classes 395 and 364, the
                two main classes dealing with hardware and software.
        SEND IPNSINFO
                This command will return an introductory message to my
                Internet Patent News Service.
        SEND CONSULT
                This command will return an introductory message to my
                patent searching consulting services I offer.
        SAVE COMMENT
                This command lets me know your request is actually a comment
                about the email server operation, or any inaccuracies you
                detect in the patent information being sent out.
    As I am parasiting the equipment to run the server (which basically means
that I operate the server at nite and on weekends), please send your requests
in at the end of the workday or on weekends.  Within a day or so, you will
receive back ny email whatever you requested.
                                    SECURITY
    A very important concern for anyone using this email server is secrecy,
that what they are searching for is not revealed to others. As a potential
inventor, I appreciate this as much as anyone else.  While I plan to save the
email addresses of people who use the server (but not their search request),
no other information will be retained.  The email address information will be
saved to study who, and how often, people are using the server.  I would
appreciate any suggestions on how to ensure security beyond this.
    Please excuse any mishaps that occur as I get this service off the ground.
This email server is a classic hack that will get better in time as people use
it.  In turn, the experience gathered in running the server will be invaluable
in demonstrating the feasibility of making massive amounts of patent data
available over the Internet.
    Also, get ready for that voluntary registration fee I mention in my intro
piece to the Internet Patent News Service.  If the Patent Titles email server
is successful, and you all like it, this fall I plan to coordinate an effort
to put all of the patent abstract information since 1970 onto the Internet,
making it available through email servers, Gopher, WAIS and Mosaic. But first
things first, getting the Patent Titles email server working.

I've been arguing that DC-Nets are among the crypto protocols that we've not
exploited much so far. I was working on an implementation, till I got stuck
with the 'net' part of it. The basic protocol is very simple, with hooks to the
bit-flipping crypto routines. The problem is integrating the DC into an existing net protocol in a manner that makes it transparent and practical to use. Ideally a layer over IP or Ethernet, as DC-Nets share many of the basic
problems of net protocols - conflict resolution, random wait-before-resend etc.
Ideas? (Read section 13.4.8 of Tim's Cyphernomicon for an explanation of Note that the major problems lie in the _practical_ implementation, which is
not necessarily the speed - despite conflict resolution and anti-collusion
techniques, the basic operation in a DC-Net, assuming the presence of a stream
of random numbers, is the fast XOR. DC-Net implementation problems are more
severe than those in secure-IP (swIPe etc) as they have to handle lots of things at a lower level in the network protocol.
Doug goes on to suggest that to be immune from the "sheep^H^H^H^H^Hpeople"
DC-Nets will have to have millions of members. But if anon remailers were used
by millions, than they'd be immune too. All crypto is vulnerable to mob action

Eric was talking about formally allocating a range of addresses for IP. That's
like putting up an RFC for each remailer, to 'notarize' the fact that the remailer is not the real source.
Any IP address can be the apparent source for the DC-Net messages. It only
has to be acknowledged by all the participants (just as remailer users have
to know about the mailer address). You may need to publicize a _disclaimer_
as IP packets don't carry Comment: lines. You don't need to formally allocate
the address, though, and certainly shouldn't have to go to the IETF - that's
hardly anarchy! One might have DCN IPs bouncing just as remailers do, and
use DCNping to see which are up ;-)

@_subject: Crypto irrelevant to hit men 
Crypto and anon escrow are largely irrelevant to the world market in
assasinations, nuclear terrorism or whatever. To put my response to the
whole 'HIT MEN' thread very concisely:
1. 'crypto anarchy' does make it easier for people to _hire_ murderers. It
   does NOT make it any easier to _commit_ murders.
2. it may be difficult for an escrow agency to have good reputations among
   murderers as well as doctors. I agree with Sandy that people don't bother
   only about reputations for specific activities, but consider organizations
   as a whole. However, reputations as I defined them in my "Social punishment"
   posts are clearly valid within possibly independent social units. You may
   have a good reputation with murderers but not with Aunt Maud.
3. Sandy says (2) leads to agencies with limited clientele, therefore higher
   rates, therefore more fraud. Narcotic drug trafficking is a $500 BILLION
   annual industry (HDR 1994). Part of the high cost is the 'illegal' and    possibly 'immoral' status of the trade. This does not necessarily mean an
   unsustainable market - indeed it's one of the world's fastest growing
   businesses. Nor do the high premia result in unsustainable levels of fraud.
   I wouldn't put my money in a bank run by the Cali cartel, no matter how    unlikely they are to ever fail. But enough people in the drug business
   trust them. Enough people trust the shady runner in the New York alley. 4. A agency only need to have a good reputation with its _clients._ It doesn't
   matter that others hold the agency in poor regard. Conversely, the agency    _needs_ a good reputation with its clients, it doesn't matter that others
   hold it in _high_ regard.
To conclude, I don't believe that crypto anarchy will significantly change the

Weekly column for The Asian Age by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh
 26/September/1994: Lamplighters in cyberspace
After diving into cyberspace for a while, people are often
relieved to temporarily return to brickspace - which is
what I call the 'real world'. On the other hand, it would
be nice if the knowbots and electronic agents that will
one day cater to all your information needs could do the
same for your lights and thermostat. Maybe they could
learn your personal lighting preferences for different
hours of the day, and adapt to your activities and moods.
Technology is a decorated excuse for laziness.
When you have the information superhighway at your
doorstep, why not invite it inside? Let software reach
beyond the World Wide Web into the World Wide Lamplighter,
let programs change more than your accounts or your
photographs, and you've opened up a whole new area of
information technology - appliance control.
Gadgets have been controlled by computers long before the
infobahn was even dreamt of. Large, cumbersome gadgets
that manufacture jet engines or process iron to steel. But
your bedside lamp still waits for you to turn it off.
Appliance control devices basically help you turn your
bedside lamp off for you - they control the resistance in
a light dimmer, or the current to a motor that opens a
door, or the thermostat of an air conditioner. Appliance
control devices are themselves controlled by software. The
software could come from anywhere - even an electronic
network. Cyberspace meets refrigerators.
Appliance controllers could be attached to everything. One
for each lamp, power point, door, window shade and chair
leg. All the controllers will be networked, so that they
can talk to each other, to the set-top box on an
interactive TV or to a notebook computer at the other end
of the world. To intelligent agents, the digital butlers
trained to learn your preferences as you work in the realm
of information, talking to an appliance controller would
be as natural as searching for a book in an electronic
library. Feedback sensors associated with appliances could
inform the agents how you like your pizza, or when to
darken the room as you fall asleep, reading. They would
also switch things of as you leave the room, saving you
the trouble as well as the pangs of guilt. Of course it
would be like living not with Big Brother, but dozens of
little Lilliputian ones, watching, listening and working
for you.
To realize this dream, in 1988, Apple Computer co-founder
Mike Markkula started Echelon, a company to promote and
manufacture networked appliance controllers. Echelon's
controller, the Neuron chip, is a little device that talks
to the universe through radio. Echelon hopes that its
product will become the standard and start appearing just
everywhere, but for the moment the major market is
industrial. Manufacturers long used to computers
controlling devices that build cars and trains are
beginning to place appliance controllers within them.
A Motorola study suggests that the average home in the
year 2000 will have a little under 250 controller chips,
but currently homes have only 50 or so, mainly in VCRs,
microwave ovens and other hi-tech devices. So until twenty-
first century consumers are ready for synchronized lights
that turn on as you enter the room, and are willing to
trust the complex software that will drive large
controller networks, cyberspace pioneers will just have to
dream on.
Blurring the boundaries between cyberspace and brickspace,
between information and reality, appliance control devices
and networks can greatly increase the efficiency of
living. They can save energy, improve security, and make
you feel quite pampered in a comfortable home. Unless,
that is, your sulking apartment refuses to let you in.

Datacom watchdog set up in India
The Forum for Rights to Electronic Expression (FREE) has been formed
in India as a body dedicated to extending fundamental rights to the
electronic domain.
FREE owes its creation to an attack on Indian datacom by the Indian
government, in the form of exorbitant licence fees (a minimum Rs. 1.5
million = US$50,000 each year for a BBS, much higher for e-mail). The
Indian government also dug up the 1885 Indian Telegraph Act, a legacy of
our British colonial masters, and used it to reserve for itself the
right to uplink to a satellite, as well as to require the provider of
any telecom value-added service to ensure that no objectionable or
obscene messages are carried on the network. Value added services
covered under these guidelines include e-mail, voice mail, BBSes, video
conferencing, etc. Any specially authorised officer of the government,
"if satisfied that it is necessary or expedient to do so" in the
interests of security of the State, friendly relations with foreign
states, or for preventing incitement to the commission of an offence,
may also tap into the system.
As yet, FREE does not have any office bearers or staff. All discussions are carried out by the entire membership on the FidoNet echo FREE.
Posting to the echo makes you a member of FREE, unless you specifically
ask not to be made one. Decisions on what may be published as a FREE
document are taken by consensus.
The first document that FREE published was a letter to the Indian
government making suggestions relating to telecom policy.

Central nodes are not nice for various reasons, including the usual networking and security (trust) advantages of wide distribution. IAC a central node is
not necessary; for example, if each node were to output to the next:
  B sends Anum XOR Brnd (XOR msg) to C
where Brnd is B's random number, msg is B's message (if any) and Anum is the
similarly generated output of A. This is much closer to the original DCNet _bit_ flipping - the first XOR checks for equality while the second commits the
'lie' In this case whatever number A gets from D is the output of the net. There are
lots of interesting cryptographic sub-protocols to make too much trust unnecessary. I also believe that error-correction is best left to lower levels
of the network - there's no need for a DC Net not to assume a reliable data

I don't see why countries will protect IPRs universally and efficiently any more than they implement the ratified treaties on privacy, human rights etc.
True, China has of late been rather busy with sprucing up its IPR protection
("chop off their heads!") in response to US pressure, much more than it did
when the US complained about human rights. But raiding big companies and
software pirates is different (and far cheaper) than tracking down all forwarded copies of AP stories. One can even imagine a world where China refuses to crack down on the ILA's hypothetical Beijing outfit (which could save Chinese companies lots of money in an information economy) out of concern for their 'human rights to privacy'!
That apart, their are some phenomenal advantages to being run by a slow,
out-dated bureaucracy (in China, or India) rather than a Freeh country such as
the US where the authorities try harder to keep up with their Cypherpunk enemies... I've said before that if my mail is read, it's not by Indian spooks

including Chaum. It then goes on to discuss in detail how e-cash could work,
how it would be backed by real money and therefore not earn interest, how
governments might get worried by the development of implicit currency markets
beyond their control, how eventually e-cash might become an independent currency with no 'real' value, hinting at my outline of 'cooking-pot' markets

Congressmen waiting to sign HR 5199 (the Clipper Bill); the DigiCash trial;
the great voice-over-data protocols and products introduced by Intel, Rockwell,
ZyXEL and others at Comdex which will make Voice-PGP so much easier (ZyXEL

@_subject: Voice over data 
I don't think that's how they do it. As far as I know, most methods multiplex
digitized audio with the data. One system used by some people in India provides
a dynamic combination of fax, (digitized) voice and data, depending on the
throughput - eg vox/9.6 data if 14.4kbps, fax as well if 19.2, etc.
While Intel and others are proposing standards, ZyXEL does it with software
along with a voice card or possibly RJ11 input. A friend of mine saw a demo
of it at Comdex, on an old 1496E (16.8 kbps zyxel to zyxel). The new v.34 does
28.8k - lots of room for clear digitized voice and high speed data.
This is exactly why I thought it would make secure voice easier, if not secure
phones (who wants to lug a modem and PC around as a 'handset'?).
I'll be testing some Onetics Rad VFAST modems this week, which apparently do
digitized voice over v.34 as well.

country you want to 'work' it. Filing first in PCT (Patent Coorporation

So far I haven't seen much discussion on the monetary effect of e-cash.
The best (and only) analysis I've seen was in last week's Economist (no, I
don't work there, I'm only a fan) of which John Young (jya was
kind enough to offer e-mail copies. I excerpt:
   The Economist
   November 26, 1994, pp. 21-23
[NO INTEREST ON E-CASH:]
         The more disputed aspects of electronic money's future
   are those that relate mainly to money's other role, as a
   store of value. ... If, to command confidence, electronic money had to be
   convertible into legal tender on demand, then for every unit of    electronic money there would have to be a unit of cash    reserved in the real economy
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   ...which is pretty much how the fledgling
   CyberCash, for example, plans to operate, requiring banks
   working with it to hold money converted into e-cash in an
   escrow account. It follows that, in an efficient system,
   if each e-cash unit represents an immobilised unit of real
   cash, then positive balances of e-cash will earn no interest,              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   because the interest they might earn would be
   offset by the interest foregone on the real cash that is
   backing them. It also follows that, in such a system, there
   would be no purely virtual lending: for this would increase
   the stock of digital money without a corresponding increase
   in the stock of real money, and so undermine
   convertibility. The virtual economy in this phase of its
   development would be free from usury.
[BYPASSING REGULATED CURRENCY MARKETS:]
 If you pay yen for electronic dollars in Tokyo and buy something from a  merchant based in Paris who cashes them for francs,  a currency conversion has taken place.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 That, however, is an activity towards which
   most governments feel highly defensive; and if e-cash
   started to bypass regulated foreign-exchange markets by
   developing its own grey market for settlement, then
   governments might be provoked into trying to clamp down on
   it. Probably, therefore, e-cash will, at least in its early
   forms, be denominated in single conventional currencies and
   exchanged at conventional market rates.
[Which wouldn't be much fun. For example, in India it's not easy for _me_ to
 convert rupees into dollars; 75% of dollars I earn must be converted into  rupees. Assuming DigiCash takes off; I sell copies of Electric Dreams and  become an e-cash millionaire. I can then buy stuff in dollars, which
 according to regulations I am not supposed to have. Similar problems arise
 in even less tightly regulated countries.
[ON A TOTALLY DIGITAL CURRENCY WITHOUT PAPER BACKING:]
         It is possible to imagine the development of e-cash
   reaching this point, and no further. But it is also
   possible to imagine that the temptation to move away from
   a fully-backed digital money would prove irresistible.
   Instinct argues that people will want virtual credit, and
   that it must therefore find a price. ...there will come
   a ... stage towards a single overarching monetary system in    which convertibility into Legal tender ceases to be a condition    for electronic money; and electronic money will thereby become    indistinguishable from -- because it will be the same as -- other, more
   traditional sorts of money. Money will be money whether it
   is constituted as a string of digits or a piece of paper or
   an entry in a ledger. Some electronic money might be backed
   by governments, some by private issuers....
   Ideally, the ultimate e-cash will be a currency without
   a country (or a currency of all countries), infinitely
   exchangeable without the expense and inconvenience of
   conversion between local denominations. It may constitute
   itself as a wholly new currency with its own denomination
   -- the "cyber-dollar", perhaps.....
   Either way, it is hard to imagine that the
   existence of an international, easy-to-use,
   cheap-to-process, hard-to-tax electronic money will not
   then force freer convertibility on traditional currencies.

I just made my first e-cash transaction.
Using, SLIP and Netscape, I webbed to HotWired to uy a sneak preview of
Bruce Sterling's Prague story to appear in the Jan issue for 0.50 cyberbucks.
At the same time, I ran the e-cash client (for Windows) from DigiCash.
It has a beautiful interface - just a few little icons visible on the screen;
it went to the back, asked me for my password to open my account, found out
what my balance was, and asked me whether I wanted to withdraw $10 from
the total of $100. I said yes.
Meanwhile I asked HotWired to send me the Sterling piece. Unfortunately it
was too quick - it came in on port (something) before the e-cash client had
filled my wallet; I tried again at HotWired, by which time the e-cash status
showed $10. My cyberwallet made a nice clanging sound, asked me whether I wanted to pay "Wired Ecash Shop" $0.50, and whether I wanted to set a payment
policy. I'm so smart - I told the client to automatically pay "Wired Ecash Shop" if it asked for less than $2 up to 10 times. Ouch! Now I can't go back
up my Web trail! When I went one step back at HotWired, for some reason
it ran the e-cash 'charge?' URL, and so 'clang' went my wallet and automatically deducted another 50c! Oops. Oh well, the whole experience was
worth a whole cyberdollar.
I also 'bought' Chaum's SciAm article, and got the reasonable lengthy list of
shops. Then I noticed it was 4 in the morning...

It's nice to see some technical discussion for a change.
I guess one reason transport layer security seems irrelevant to Cypherpunks
is that it isn't secure. Not necessarily from a cryptographic point of view,
but in its procedure. For example, the Digital Telephony Bill avoided acting
against Internet providers _this_ time. Being provided by the carrier,
transport-layer security is succeptable to LEA arm-twisting. It may be so
even now despite DT's current form.
Such sabotaging of end-to-end security is much tougher, if not impossible,
and with end-to-end security, transport security is redundant and possibly
a painful overhead.
(This is quite apart from the other hassles - proxies need to be changed etc -
which only exist with transport security.)
As for James Donald's criticism of the IETF for not extending HTML to support
end-to-end security, well, MIME already exists.

layer?" The transport layer is insecure because: it is less under the control
of a user, it happens 'automagically'; it is at a lower level and so generally
implemented by central authorities - sysadmins etc, and does not suit the
web of trust model (nor does X.509) which is much better outside dictatorships; it is provided by the telco or net service provider who, as I suggested earlier, are prone to arm-twisting by the authorities, whether
by legislation, or while 'cooperating'.
Transport layer security does not provide data authentication, it only
provides server authentication; nor does it provide data security and privacy
between users, it only provides network security.
To rebut Kipp's favourite justification, insecure transmission of passwords:
transport layer security does _not_ improve password security/privacy, but
only ensures that once a plaintext password is received by the transport
layer, usually at a service provider, then it will not be intercepted. Secure
transmission of passwords could (but as far as I know is not widely) be implemented at the client level, through DH handshaking or something, which
would ensure a completely secure and _private_ transaction.
Transport layer security is nice because it is conveniently automatic and
transparent, but it can lead to a false sense of security for precisely that
Of course these are quintessentially Cypherpunk objections. A bank, or
Singapore, would be quite comfortable with such a system for internal networks.

 12/December/1994: Processing data, information and knowledge
Computers are good at processing data. Juggling numbers,
indexing names and addresses, these are the rudimentary
tasks upon which much of the world's infrastructure
depends. Computers are mediocre at processing information,
the layering of data with complex inter-relationships. But
they are simply pathetic at handling knowledge, the models
based on piles of information used to understand and
predict an aspect of the world around us, expressed by
humans not in tables and charts, but in articles and
Computers are organized. They can understand streams of
homogeneous inputs, they can follow links between data
that are made clear and detailed. This preference for
structure makes it somewhat difficult to get computers to
process more naturally expressed concepts and knowledge
embodied in human-language text.
Passing over the entirely academic debate about the
ability or otherwise of machines to ever understand human
ideas, the fact is that most attempts at getting computers
to process or aid in processing such ideas has
concentrated on making computers 'artificially
intelligent' - making them form their own structured model
of relatively unstructured text.
Computer systems for natural language processing try to
find meaning in a text by translating it into some
internal representation, with the aid of a detailed
grammar-book far more explicit than most humans could
bear. Most natural language processing is either too slow,
too inaccurate, or too limited to a particular human
language or set of concepts to be practically useful on a
large scale. While it may be pretty good for simple voice-
based interfaces, NLP is unlikely in the near future to be
able to, for instance, quickly go through 2 years of Time
magazine and identify the US government's changing policy
on the war in Bosnia.
While NLP begins with the assumption that machines need
some sort of understanding to process text, other methods
concentrate more on practical applications. These usually
abandon any attempt to search for a structure in textual
inputs, and rely instead on identifying a vague pattern.
Neural networks, which try to simulate the working of the
brain, are frequently used to identify patterns in images,
sounds and financial data. Though they are often quite
successful at their limited tasks, they are not normally
used to process text. One reason for this is perhaps that
text either needs to be interpreted in the small chunks of
conversation, which requires a knowledge of grammar that
conventional NLP provides; the other use for text
processing is in organizing huge volumes of it, for which
neural networks are too slow.
The alternative comes strangely enough from the US
National Security Agency. It has always been suspected
that the NSA searches through e-mail traffic for
'sensitive' material, which for the large volumes involved
would require considerable help from computers. Earlier
this year, the agency began soliciting collaborations from
business to develop commercial applications of their
technique. It claimed to be able to quickly search through
large quantities of text, in any language, for
similarities to sample documents, and even automatically
sort documents according to topics that it identifies. A
similar though independently developed system is available
from California-based Architext.
Though statistical techniques for text processing are not
entirely new, the continuing development in the area is a
sign of the growing use of computers as knowledge-
processing aids. By identifying patterns more-or-less
blindly, without any attempt at understanding the concepts
they represent, they can help us make some sense of the
ocean of information that otherwise threatens to swamp us.

"Ian Farquhar" :
Stat text scanning is ancient, but has probably not been used on the scale
and efficiency that the NSA would require for net traffic.
Actually my 'info' about NSA's thing was mainly deduction put together with some (limited) specs on Architext (
graham If you read NSA's note carefully, you easily rule out
NLP ("independent of...language") and sophisticated neural nets ("very fast").
The Economist story I mentioned in my last post (on the fact that I beat them to the story!) goes into some detail on BT and Cornell's programs that
summarize textual matter. These are apparently successful (included is an
pretty good example of a computer-generated summary of the article), but also quite different from NSA's.
BT uses basic NLP to get past articles, conjunctions etc (making it
language-dependent), and stems (removes -ing, -ed, -s etc, unlike NSA
which denies stemming, dictionaries etc; obviously language-dependent),
before creating statistical table of word frequencies which are used to
determine the subject of a sentence or the similarities between texts.
Cornell can search "gigabytes of data ... in a few seconds [for] a
subject" or similarity to an example text. It can figure out which
sentences are 'important' (by comparing frequency tables).
I suspect NSA's is much more pattern-oriented, as its USP is document clustering; maybe it uses some NN at some level. Of course you don't really
need to know grammar to filter out articles and pronouns; you could do that
statistically too.

Re traffic analysis, cpunk remailers, DC-nets.
Electric Dreams
Weekly column for The Asian Age by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh
 19/December/1994: Envelopes speak - tracking information flow
Digital communication is extremely vulnerable to
interception, sorting and archival. Current electronic
mail systems offer less privacy than open messages on
postcards - at least it's impractical to keep copies of
enormous quantities of paper mail. Encryption, which is
slowly gaining popularity as a means of ensuring a degree
of privacy of e-mail and eventually voice communication,
is analogous to letters in sealed envelopes. This protects
against one invasion of privacy - of communication
content, or what you write and read. However there is at
present little protection against a possibly more serious
invasion of privacy, that of communication context, or to
whom you send and from whom you receive messages. As such
messages can include anything from New Year greetings to a
friend to contract negotiations to CD purchases, there is
a lot that can be known about you from addressing details
on the most secure, encrypted mail - the tale the
envelopes tell.
Currently, whether you make a phone call or send an e-
mail, your communication is routed through a host of
different sites - telephone exchanges or computers around
the world. It may not be technically possible for these
sites to extract the content of your message because of
encryption. It is not feasible, and usually illegal, for
them to archive traffic. But it is very easy to archive
routing information, and such logs are routinely kept by
computers on the e-mail network as well as telephone
The legal process of getting access to addressing
information is much simpler than for intercepting
communication content itself, because it is often assumed
that such information is, on its own, useless. Actually it
is probably more useful than interception. Such traffic
analysis helped track Iranian assassins in France earlier
this year, using records of 20,000 phone calls from public
booths. It could also be used for intrusive monitoring of
your income or hospital visits, or for that matter to
crack down on Tibetan human rights activists.
Cypherpunks - the assorted citizens of cyberspace who try
to protect privacy through the use of technology - may
have a solution. Elated by the success of anonymous
remailers - special e-mail addresses that repost messages
after removing any traces of the original sender,
especially favoured in discussion forums for victims of
sexual abuse - they are now working on methods to reduce,
if not eliminate altogether, the menace of traffic
analysis. Without these, it would be possible to associate
anonymous messages with their original senders by
carefully matching arrival times in various system logs.
Remailers and their users resort to several
countermeasures. They collect incoming mail and repost
anonymized versions in batches of random sizes, to avoid a
correlation between mail arrival times. They route mail
through random groups of remailers, often in different
countries, to make tracing posts back to the source
harder. And of course, they encrypt as much traffic as
Although remailers prevent reverse traffic analysis -
tracking mail from the recipient to the sender - they
don't protect against traffic analysis from source -
tracking the output of a specific site or individual.
Dining Cryptographer networks, or DC-Nets were developed
almost a decade ago as a networking protocol allowing a
group of people to broadcast messages, while making it
impossible to identify the specific source from within the
group. Unfortunately DC-Nets have not yet gone beyond the
early experiments; but there is hope that they will soon
silence the electronic envelopes of traffic analysis.
Privacy and freedom of expression are basic human rights.
Where laws and international treaties have failed to
protect them, it looks increasingly likely that in a
borderless world of digital signals, technology will.

@_author: in my view of the Cpunk position 
@_subject: Re: Morality masks technical ignorance 
And the key word in _my_ post was _means_, not _reason why_. I.e. that
(in my view of the Cpunk position) one can protect privacy not through morals,
policies or law, but through technology. There may be very good reasons why
governments should not require the implementation of key escrow, or why
people shouldn't pry into their girlfriends' secrets (which if you really want
to know I find reprehensible). Unfortunately those reasons of morality need not
prevent the actions.
Which is why Cypherpunks discuss untraceable anonymous remailers despite occasionally (aka Detweiler, for instance) decrying their (immoral) misuse,
and why they should discuss breaking Norton Encrypt (or DES, or Skipjack, or
16384-bit RSA keys), while giving sermons about immoral boyfriends. Nobody
(the Single-Horned One included) thinks reading other peoples' mail is moral,
but that should not preclude a legitimate discussion of crypto technology.
As it so happens, hardly anyone here knew about Norton Encrypt so we got
embroiled in this argument. If we were to adopt a consistently (and solely)
moral stance, we would accept Detweiler's position that remailers are bad
and should be banned because they can be easily misused.
Well, I guess these are the glitches in discourse we have to face on a list
that's for both technology and policy.

OK, what I meant of course was that we could adopt the _moral stance_ that remailer misusers (like misbehaving boyfriends) are reprehensible, and that therefore we should not discuss making remailers untraceable (or breaking
Norton Encrypt) lest we inadvertantly help the Forces of Evil.
OTOH knowledge about anonymous remailers (and the fallibility of Norton Encrypt) is _good_ for privacy - as I said, the latter was not discussed due
to apparent technical ignorance.

Hello. At one time I posted a message asking for volunteers to help me debug some reputation/mail filtering software. My "phase two" tests are progressing
and the software is serving multiple subscribers with a degree of
reliability. I would now like to open up my tests to the wider cypherpunk
audience for "phase three".  I would be delighted if anyone would be interested in participating.
At this point I particularly need people who want to play with the command features and are not just subscribing to what they see as a free and no-involvement-required mail filtering service. In preparation
for any new users I have just html'd the complete documentation
for easy reference on my web site.
The software is still in a prototype stage and the redistribution of
messages is not at the utmost reliable level. In particular at this
stage I may still have to periodically put the list on "hold" periodically to debug the software. However at this point I believe the reliability
is rapidly nearing a high level.
For more information use Mosaic or Lynx to the URL
(I have relaxed earlier more formal nondisclosure terms but I do ask that you submit to an informal "nonpublicity" agreement.)
This will serve as the master bulletin board for future developments
in the software. pay special attention to the "status" item which
I will update very regularly (and in most cases use in lieu of
a mailing list)

It's nice to know that the US Customs are catching up with the technical

I've been on the Cypherpunk's mailing list for about half its lifetime,
am a technology consultant based in New Delhi, do a weekly column on
information society which has covered many of the issues you seem interested
in, and write for WIRED magazine. I am interested in law and ethics in
cyberspace, and would like to participate in your project, as long as it
is not primarily intended to culminate in a set of guidelines for legislation,
which I believe to be pointless. I'm including here some comments to your original announcement, which I only saw today. Unfortunately, due to the way media works, we don't read of the benefits of
total anonymity to participants in sexual abuse groups, human rights activists
and many others. Going by what we read in the media, 93.5% of people on the Net are habitual child abusers, and 62% are nuclear-equipped narco-terrorists.
Or free it from the monopoly of large media organizations. Ninety-five percent
of the world's news is distributed by four agencies, who effectively shape our
view of the world at large, and decide for us the crises du jour. The Net,
_precisely_ because of its unregulated, bottom-up structure, allowed activists
to communicate during the revolution in Chiapas, Mexico; got international agencies to offer support for the massive earthquake in Latur India at once,
rather than wait for a Time magazine photo feature (which - surprise! - was
on Somalia just days before the world suddenly took notice of _that_ problem).
The commitment to freedom of expression, in _any form whatsoever_ including
the anonymous, is arguably the cause for much of the economic and technological
power of the US. It is a matter for concern that, rather than help spread
this freedom to the rest of the world (as is inevitable _if_ the Internet
continues not to be 'governed'), many in and out of government are attempting
to clamp down, out of an almost primeval fear of Digital Evil that stems from
ignorance of wider issues.
On the contrary, the 'current state of anarchy' has largely been responsible
for advancements in US research for the two decades since the Internet was
born. What is needed, perhaps, is a dialogue to improve understanding among
'society at large' of a community that is, though at present largly composed of technology professionals or academics, an example of multicultural and multinational cooperation and tolerance that would be nice to see in, say,
Los Angeles, or elsewhere in the 'real world'.

Weekly column for The Asian Age by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh
 31/October/1994: Selling privacy as a commodity
It was once said that you should never post publicly to
cyberspace what you don't want to see in tomorrow's
newspapers. While newspapers are rarely interested in your
idle thoughts, others are. Future employers, advertisers
and an army of 'user profilers' have begun to exploit the
availability of huge data banks of Net traffic, just
waiting to be indexed by your names and opinions.
It is already possible to buy CD-ROM or tape archives of
posts to newsgroups on the Internet. Collecting newsgroup
posts as they arrive is trivial. Apart from ordinary
Internet connections, all newsgroups are available on one-
way, open-access satellite data broadcasts. As traffic
flows in, it can be indexed and backed up on extremely
cheap storage media such as Digital Audio Tape, for later
search and retrieval.
While the US National Security Agency is naturally one of
the best at hunting for signs of incorrect thinking in
cyberspace, several techniques to search large volumes of
data by very flexible criteria are publicly available.
Electronic writing is one of the best sources for
employers to learn the views of prospective employees. The
groups people participate in can also form useful inputs
to consumer profiles. Some companies have already started
offering directory services based on posts to USENET, the
semi-official collection of major newsgroups. It is easy
to imagine Profiles-R-Us shops that sell dossiers on any
individual, detailing political, religious and sexual
preferences, and other interesting tidbits - all the nasty
things you ever said about Microsoft, for instance!
Public discussion is of course just that, and it's
ridiculous to attempt to prevent it being put to use for
purposes not originally intended. The remedy to an
invasion is to build walls; when the invasion is one of
privacy, the walls are technological. Some pioneers are
already protecting themselves through the use of
encryption, digital signatures, and multiple pseudonyms -
making it impossible for profilers to associate opinions
with real people.
In a way, the Invasion Of The Profilers is a good thing -
it will make individuals realize what little privacy they
have, and teach them the value of privacy. Not everyone
will want to seal themselves in private cocoons. Most will
not object to some loss of privacy, but in exchange for a
(not necessarily monetary) share of the profilers'
profits. Individuals will control their privacy and
selectively reduce it when it benefits themselves.
A particularly useful application of this is in an
electronic public library. Once access to data is severely
restricted to protect intellectual property rights, the
Internet as a source of knowledge for everyone will die,
unless libraries are opened to provide information free of
cost. Such libraries need not survive on subsidies;
rather, they can ask for a copy of any information base in
cyberspace from all publishers. By limiting access to
individuals who are willing to give up some privacy, the
library and publishers will benefit from the sale of
users' access records to advertisers. Advertisers will be
delighted, as most other inputs for profiling in a privacy-
aware society will be unavailable. Finally, users will get
free access to information if they so choose, at a cost
that they can agree to.
While one can be frightened by the ease with which a
multitude of Big Brothers can monitor the citizens of
cyberspace, technology, as always, has something for
everyone. As it becomes easier to search through
electronic communications, it also becomes easier to
protect privacy to varying degrees. Individuals will be
forced to be aware of risks to their privacy. With the
opening of markets for profiles, privacy may finally find

Electric Dreams
Weekly column for The Asian Age by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh
 9/January/1995: Gateways to the infosphere
Asimov once wrote of a universe where intelligent life was
intelligence alone, roaming the avenues of pure thought
divorced from all physical form. To reach the infosphere
with your feet still on this planet though, you need a
point of access, a gateway to what could easily become
another world in your life. The nature of these gateways,
their availability and their owners are among the more
contentious aspects of the global information
The task of developing this infrastructure to the point of
ubiquity has been compared to the construction of road
networks - any place, however remote, must be connected to
every other. As this would make little economic sense for
private investors, the task had to be one for the
government. Present-day governments are poor, so they
insist that subsidies should come from business in the
form of universal service: providing the same thing at the
same prices everywhere.
The rationale for this is noble - equal opportunity to
all. Without roads people can't get anywhere, literally
and economically, and the same must be true for
information highways. But if the info-highway is actually
an information ocean, the situation changes dramatically.
It is no longer necessary to move from place to place, but
simply to dive in.
This is true even in practical terms. On a highway, the
route traffic takes is important, because of the distance,
while on the Internet routing is a very low-level,
technical sort of thing, as data may travel in little
pieces on different paths, ignoring geographical distance.
Moreover, a highway needs a physical connection between
any two points, which affects costs, while the infosphere
floats above waiting to be reached through a satellite
transceiver from just anywhere.
Nor will the lack of universal service lead to a society
of information haves and have-nots. Information is unique
in that one doesn't 'have' it. It is created, and a 'have-
not' can easily become a 'have'. The possible inequality
is in trading information resources, in knowledge
opportunities. However, especially in the field of
information, people are not equally equipped to take
advantage of opportunities, however unequally distributed
the latter may be. Instead of demanding universal service,
governments should encourage the development of
infrastructure where it will be best used, which is in the
interests of business, anyway.
Unfortunately even telecom corporations have an incorrect
perception of who the best users are. They believe in
connecting those who can pay now for services, rather than
the many more who would benefit and therefore be able to
pay the most, once they exploit currently non-existent
Demand-driven markets grow fastest, though companies right
now seem to be more interested in shoving interactive
television down the eyes of the reluctant and rather bored
elite. A demand-driven information market is harder to
work with, as prospective buyers (as also the sellers)
have to be convinced of the benefits of technology. But
the potential markets are huge, if far from the minds of
the vendors of 'convergence' technology, as peoples'
information (or entertainment) needs are often more basic
than their material needs - just look at Bombay slum-
dwellers, who despite limited access to clean drinking
water, buy colour televisions and VCRs. They only needed
to see what TV was good for, first.
An information ocean is cheaper to build than any highway
could possibly be. It needs no legislation to exist
everywhere, this is in its very nature. Gateways to the
infosphere will, governments permitting, sprout
spontaneously wherever needed, as cracks on the surface of
a frozen sea.

@_subject: Data Havens, NOT! 
I believe the Data Haven started out as a Message Haven to get the effect
of anon remailers with less traffic analysis hassles, so there would be no
pseudonymous login or anything, you'd either download everything, or apply
some filter (as with an alt.anon-messages group).
However, the current discussion of glorified remote file systems makes no sense to me. If you can keep something encrypted on a remote site as an archive, you can do it at home. A data haven is more likely to get busted than your home PC; serious efforts (RF pickup of keystrokes/display) will be equally effective in either case.
Here's a summary of data havens as I see them:
Remote file system where people can anon/pseudonymously dump and read files
- in the 'pure' variety there'd be no record of who posted/can read a file.
1. Could hinder traffic analysis, if they did not have pseudonymous login
   in any form. 2. Could act as a store of encrypted data for those who can't/don't encrypt
   on their own systems
3. Could act as a backup
1. Would depend on 'correct usage' ie download of enough irrelevant cover    data, and would be vulnerable to analysis at the TCP/IP level. Newsgroups
   remain far better as means to evade traffic analysis
2. Don't keep all your encrypted BlackNet commodities in one basket - it
   can be busted more easily than your home machine. If you can encrypt there
   you can encrypt at home; if encryption is illegal at home, you can't legally
   access the havens.
3. Pfaugh! Rent space on Netcom.

@_subject: Lance Rose writes anti-cryptoanarchy in WIRED 
I've missed recent traffic so forgive me if this has already come up.
Lance Rose writes a particularly twisted piece in the Idees Fortes section of
WIRED 3.02 (February). His basic premise is that tradritional forms of copyright law are sufficient to ensure that the Net poses only limited problems to mass content producers such as Time Warner. I agree with this,
as most people feel uncomfortable about 'stealing' however impossible it is
to detect. Lance Rose, though, goes on to insist that the reason for the
copyright law's strength will be the power of the omnipresent Net Cops (sic).
So that you don't consider him entirely ignorant, he acknowledges the increasing use of anon remailers. However, he adds (repeatedly), "Can't
we all use anonymous remailers to keep the Net knee-deep in infringing copies?
Nope. Net cops can swiftly clean each new infringement out of the major online
markets as soon as it appears." How will they do this so efficiently? By "deploying software agents" net-wide
to "search out anonymous infringements." He later admits the possibility of
"friend-to-friend" markets, but rejects the possibility of such markets growing
out of hand, as "few or none of the participants will know everyone else in the
circle" allowing cops to join them undetected (as if the Information Liberation
Front would mind giving the _cops_ pirated software). "A symbolic legal attack"
every once in a while will scare would-be black-marketeers.
Later, he does discuss the hidden costs of acquiring pirated versus genuine stuff - "the time and effort needed to track down pirate dealers [...] who are so deep underground even the cops can't find them."
Sheesh. And here we are, post-BlackNet, discussing untraceable paid-for
anon-remailers (which exist today on Sameer's c2.org blind server) and
data havens. I haven't bothered to hunt for Lance's address, which is not
given, but really I thought someone as prominent a SysLawyer as him would
be clued in. Nor have I found the time to send WIRED a letter. OTOH maybe ignorance, for LEA-friendly legislators who read WIRED, is bliss?
Let the sleeping dog lie, etc, just finish your data haven code ;-]

able to ignore international copyright law (Berne Convention etc) than China;
however, despite howls of protest even China is likely to knuckle down eventually. What may be likely is distributed piracy markets, such as described in Tim's BlackNet spoof.

@_author: the tolerant sysadmin 
@_subject: Re: The Remailer Crisis 
Tim urges recently that we need to do something about the "remailer crisis."
I remember Sameer once mentioning that he could set up remailer-in-a-box accounts for possibly anonymous 'sponsors' who'd be the legal owners therefore
indemnifying Sameer (the tolerant sysadmin) of responsibility. I know he allows
'remail-to-yourself' blind-server accounts for $10 / meg or something. That's
probably a bit expensive for a sponsor of a public remailer (any stats on average remailer traffic?). I never did here any more from sameer or anyone
else about remailers-in-boxed-accounts. I for one would be willing to 'sponsor'
a remailer account on any system with a small fee - I can't run my own as my private site looks at the world through PPP.
I suggest that 'sponsored' remailers are a better way of making remailers
economically viable for people like Sameer, who are the real, if not nominal,
administrators. Though I hardly use remailers, those who do would probably
make better (and more easily executed) use of their money if they sponsor
remailer accounts on Cypherpunk ISPs like c2, rather than pay a (truenamed, legally vulnerable) operator for any single remailer.
Sameer's blind-server code can come in use to make any link between the sponsor and her sponsored account very hard to detect.
The advantages of sponsoring remailer-site operators to create remailing
accounts, rather than pay an individual remailer operator, are many:
1. innocent until proven guilty - presumably sponsors do use remailers a lot;
   but not necessarily. So the payment transaction can be via truename, rather
   than via some complicated anonymous means, and still leave the sponsor
   unimplicated
2. legal - an operator of a single remailer is vulnerable - technically, if
   not root, and legally otherwise. an administrator of a Cypherpunk ISP is
   not, and does not have the legal right to monitor a customer's traffic,
   and with blind-servers even detailed logging don't lead back to the
   owner of an account, the sponsor, from any _specific_ remailer (though
   a pool of sponsors exist for a pool of remailer account)
3. technical - it's not possible to ban a single remailer, as they may be    _many_ on a site. If the site is much more than just remailers, it's not
   really possible to ban the entire site.
4. traffic analysis - more remailers addresses will make traffic analysis
   harder, and chaining more fun - you could chain through multiple accounts
   on a single site with little loss in reliability (though you'll still want
   to go through more sites)
5. remailer explosion - more reliable remailers (due to the '-in-a-box', more    users, wider distribution

rkmoore (Richard K. Moore)
I've never figured out why governments are made out to be so bad; guns, ok,
but the problems of privacy we face on this list have little to do with that.
Corporations can be at least as bad - extreme government leads to socialism,
which often retains some form of citizen-participation in decision-making;
the corporate state, though, is exemplified in fascism, inherently much less
concerned about citizen's rights.
As many of us have argued, in what is sometimes called a 'post-capitalist'
economy, (intellectual) property rights will not be enforceable. They may
be respected often - but then that requires no laws; after all no one had
tried to rob Phil Zimmerman of his (only recently trademarked) 'PGP'. Those
who depend too much on enforced rights will not survive. I've discussed in
my column, Electric Dreams, and on this list the shift in economic structure
that will have to take place - cooking-pot markets, knowledge exchanges etc;
concept patents enforced by net.cops are most certainly 'Second Wave thinking!'
Praise from Gingrich the Newt's pet think tank...
'Third Wave' is such a lovely phrase that it is all too easy to hand wave opposing beliefs and concerns - "that's Second Wave thinking." Reminds me of the Freudian defense against Jung - "Ah, Jung was sexually repressed as an infant and therefore jealous of his mentor's open emphasis on id..." - solipsism is great for argument, but does little to elicit the truth.
FOL! That competition and distributed ownership is elitist has long been
held true by communists; the reason we prefer it this way is that monopolies
end up being elitist too - benefiting those within them.
Those who remember their history will note that the original Magna Carta was
not a pact that distributed power from a King to the people, but to a feudal
nobility - the rest of us, netSERF on!

chaining, all you do is stop the NSA from knowing your final destination from
the first remailer, but they _would_ know the identity of the second remailer
(assuming the first is compromised) and could try to attack the second, ad
nauseum. Of course this was always known to be the problem, to which chaining
and traffic analysis evasion are partial solutions.

The Internet develops its own order...
Electric Dreams
Weekly column for The Asian Age by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh
 30/January/1995: Tribes, cyberspace and the communication society
Industrialization brought with it many social changes.
Concentrating power in cities, it expanded the value of
property rights and built a complex formal legal system to
enforce them. It gave birth to the powerful police force
as the means for keeping law and order in the urban
population of gathered strangers, and, while spreading
democracy, distanced people from the process of
legislation that affected them. All this is going to
change as the information revolution engulfs the planet.
Perhaps surprisingly, the social changes to come will more
closely reflect humans as they interacted millennia ago,
rather than as they did in the more recent past.
Before industrialization, cities were much less important.
The village (in an idealized history) was the key social
unit, as the tribe was in pre-agricultural communities.
Economic power, being geographically distributed, resulted
in considerable control by people over the informal rules
that governed them and their immediate environment,
despite the absence of democracy as we now know it.
Property rights were lax, especially in tribal society;
villages placed great importance on common land. There was
correspondingly little emphasis on a police force or
formal law. Order was maintained primarily through systems
of social punishment - reputation and taboo.
As cities formed, the value of owned property increased,
as there was little sense of community or common benefit
among strangers. Crime increased, property rights became
important to enforce, and taboo was no longer an effective
preserver of order primarily because unlike villages, the
city is not what I call a communication society. People
don't depend on each other in cities as much as in
villages, nor does the threat of ostracization work, as
social interaction is a far greater component of rural
than urban life. Urban society needed, and developed,
modern forms of centralized law enforcement.
As mainstream media and the general public discover the
relative anarchy of the Internet, they take fright at its
apparent disorder and suggest the need for government if
cyberspace is to have a future - people fear freedom. At
least until they experience it - after all, the Net has
been around long before it became front-page news, and has
evolved its own, distributed, law. Based on principles of
total freedom of expression and a strong dislike of
irrelevant content outside clearly defined zones,
infractions are met sometimes by the guerrilla action of
spontaneous protest, sometimes by ostracization.
This works because cyberspace is also a communication
society. While McLuhan's Global Village has become
extremely cliched, in this aspect cyberspace does resemble
a village. People on the Net may not be dependent on each
other for food and clothing, but they are for almost
anything else concerned with a cyber life. Cyberspace is
full of vibrant communities that do little else but talk,
and with social interaction at a higher level than at any
time in history, it is well suited to a system of social
punishment such as taboo; indeed, this may become the only
practical form of wired justice, and could be very
effective - in cyberspace, if nobody talks to you, you're
The similarity to pre-industrial communities does not end
with modes of governance, but extends to basic issues of
economics. Property rights in the infosphere are
contentious; they keep getting more impractical to
enforce, and will play a diminished role in a post-
industrial world as technology and people work around
attempts at formal legislation. Without realizing it, the
denizens of the Net have already created a vast 'cooking-
pot' market in software, news and information, based on
the very tribal notion of shared property and benefit.
That government and industry will work with such
disorganized economies is extremely unlikely, but they are
so inherent to the communication society that cyberspace
is, that they will survive, though perhaps occasionally
going underground.
Technology and society go hand in hand, but sometimes
history repeats itself, if not without variation. Though
the realm of information forms but part of our lives, that
part will increase, and affect the rest. If we are a
communication society while in the ocean of information,
what might we be outside?

@_author: slightly lengthy 
@_subject: Selection key crypto protocol trial balloon 
Before replying to Tim's comments on Mike Ingle's new directions for anonymity
which, I think, are based on a misunderstanding of what Mike was essentially
positing, here's my (slightly lengthy) take on the Selection Key Crypto protocol. Please read it before criticising, as I've already done that...
Mp is the plaintext message. Alice encrypts it with Bob's public key:
Mc = E.kpub (M)                                 [1]
She sends Mc to Hermes, the Hoarder of Messages. Hermes also receives Alice's identity string (Ia) which will probably be anonymous, but let's assume it's not. Now's the tricky bit. Hermes adds Mc to its message store, S:
S' = G (S, Mc)                                  [2]
The key here is G, the Digest function, which has to spread M over S (with a variation of the Fourier function, perhaps), and not just append it, so that
the _only_ way it can be extracted is with Bob's selection key, which Bob
transmits to Hermes along with an involuntary identity string (Ib) to get:
Mx = H.ksel (S')                                [3]
where H.ksel is the Regurgitate function applied with Bob's selection key,
and Mx is _not_ the original encrypted message, Mc, nor the plaintext Mp.
Finally Bob decrypts Ms with his _private_ key (or possibly a variation, which
we'll call v(kpri)), to get the plaintext:
Mp = D.v(kpri) (Ms)                                [4]
So the possible crypto operations are:
Mp = D.kpri (E.kpub(Mp))
Mp = D.v(kpri) (Mx)  where v(x) may be = x
Mx = H.ksel (S')
And the Digest function, S' = G (S, E.kpub(Mp))
Note that only the private key kpri, and its variation v(kpri) are private. The other two are public.
Now for the obvious criticisms:
1. after [1] Hermes can store Alice's identity (Ia) in a dark grey dossier,
   and match it to Bob's identity (Ib) and the extracted message (Mx). Nope.
   The premise of this scheme is that Mx doesn't look like Mc at all, and that
   G (in [2]) dissolves the original message into a sludge, from which Mx
   somehow emerges, NOT that it chops Mc into bits with Ia on a little nametag
2. after [1] Hermes can store Ia along with the message and feed [Mc, Ia]
   to [2] in the hope that it will reappear in [3] as [Mx, Ia']. Well, the
   digest function has prevent this, possibly by making the regurgitated
   thing so different from the input that matching Ia to Ia' will be    impossible. Of course, Bob probably won't grok [Mx, Ia'] in [4]
3. Hermes gets Bob's identity string (Ib) in [3]. Et alors? As that is    incidental, not required to extract the message (unlike in a remailer, where
   that identity string - e-mail address, return block, whatever is _precisely_
   what is required for a message to reach), it's irrelevant. The _real_
   identity is the selection key, which does not correlate to any cyberspatial
   location. See further on traffic analysis.
4. ksel, Bob's selection key, is obviously not private, at least not to Hermes,
   and may as well be public. So anyone can extract the message intended for
   Bob (which reinforces my previous point that Ib is irrelevant). But what
   they extract is Mx, which is not the plaintext. To get the plaintext you
   need not the selection key but Bob's private key, which only Bob has.
5. The Digest function [2-3] has to be robust, i.e. it shouldn't puke if
   it's got lots of messages, and should be able to extract the right one
   in any state. Well, yes, that's tough.
Traffic analysis
The difference between the SKC model and remailers
  Alice --> (Raven, the remailer net) --> Bob   .... multiplied ad infinitum
  Alice --> (Hermes) --> Bob
                     --> Carol, David, the whole world as the                          selection key is public
The remailer net is essentially one-to-one, making traffic analysis easier
and limiting Bob's deniability - if the last remailer says it's gone to Bob,
it was _for_ Bob.
The broadcast model essentially increases deniability - they all got it,
any of them could have seen it if they had the key, and you'll only know that
I had the private key with thumb-screws. But they all _get_ it, so bandwidth
is huge.
The SKC model is a compromise. It increases deniability - anyone could have
got it, they all have the selection key, they could only have seen it with the
private key etc. It cuts bandwidth. But it's not a data haven, at least not
as earlier discussed.
The data haven in its latest guise has the same deniability as SKC, and the
same prerequisites that aid recipient protection (anon anon ftp etc). But it
doesn't protect the sender. If the haven is in collusion with remailers that
Alice used to post, it can link her to the message and possibly to Bob. With
SKC, even with the collusion of remailers the link gets lost in digestion.
Also, Bob (or anyone) can frequently extract stuff with the selection key,
perhaps garbage if Hermes is misbehaving or without messages for Bob.
Of course when (and how) Hermes is to expire messages is part of the problem
of the various functions involved.

True, just as ciphertext is not different, informationally, from plaintext.
It's just a pair of transformations, both by the system, one in response to
the sender and the other in response to the receiver. A bit like an airlock -
if the two transformations are the right ones, extraneous information such as
the identity should not pass through.

Electric Dreams
Weekly column for The Asian Age by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh
 6/February/1995: Labour and capital in a post-industrial economy
The information economy will require not only knowledge
capital, but also knowledge labour. Labour has
historically been subservient to capital (or land, in
agricultural societies) as a source of power and wealth,
leading to various forms of political upheaval contrary to
the naturally unequal relationship between these two
essentials of an economy. But the knowledge revolution
will change the nature of labour even more than it will
that of capital, while also decreasing the distinction
between them.
One of the major differences between capital and labour in
the past is that capital, owned and protected by property
rights, can earn for its owners without their making any
significant effort. Labour, though, is inherent in its
'owners' - you really don't need laws to protect your
ownership of your capacity to work - and earns only with
considerable effort from them. It follows that owners of
capital are wealthier than providers of labour, at least
until a digital deluge changes the rules altogether.
A strict (but not universally accepted) definition of
knowledge capital would consist primarily of those
relatively static forms of intellectual output - specific
ideas, software, works of art - that can be treated as
property, thereby inviting legal protection in the form of
patent and copyright. Like traditional capital, these
don't necessarily require the intervention of their owner
(after the work of painting or inventing is over) to
generate cash. Intellectual property rights will do the
Unfortunately for fans of intellectual property rights,
they are unworkable. As the sprawling information economy
grows volatile and fast-changing, copyrights and patents
are simply not going to be enforced. The ease of
undetectable duplication, together with the suffocating
effects of strong protection on growing markets, have been
acknowledged by everyone familiar with both the
technological as well as economic aspects. Expertise,
then, not information, is the key.
Expertise, which is dynamic and constantly adapting, is
not 'intellectual property'. It hardly requires legal
protection, and cannot be separated from its owners, the
experts, in whom it inheres. Nor do experts earn without
themselves making active use of their skills. Experts are,
in fact, knowledge labourers.
Not, of course, that these labourers own no capital. Quite
the contrary -experts almost always rely on more static
works, ideas, resources, that are their own. However, this
'property' being less important than their expertise,
knowledge labourers (or knowledge workers, to use a more
familiar but not always equivalent term) often don't
bother about patents or copyrights. Knowledge capital is
not, after all, as valuable as expertise and is also more
inconvenient to rely on - so it will act as the auxiliary
resource, rather as labour has done in industry.
Once we realize this reversal of roles between labour and
capital in a post-industrial economy, we face the prospect
of a vast labour force of experts of all sorts. Knowledge
labour will not always be high-end, though - for every
millionaire quant plotting coffee futures against money-
market derivatives, there will be the human agent,
cybrarian in the jargon, hunting for curious clients rare
species of data amid the information jungle. And there
will always be some who cling on to their intellectual
property rights and attempt to extract license fees from
the on-line universe. But their share of the economy will
shrink, and finally, in the era of expertise, what you
have will matter less, than what you do.

Hal :
It need not be the same information - i.e. if the encryption process adds enough noise to the message, the extraction process might by lossy, without any total loss for the receiver. This may be possible particularly if Fourier-style transforms are used, as the "selection key" could pick up less "frequencies" of a message than are stored at the intermediary.
The same could be said of a private/public key pair. What is crucial is the
association between the keys.
This said, while I can imagine separate systems for the intermediary loosing correlation between incoming and outgoing messages (eg - it's _really_ tough,
without fancy pattern recognition, to associate a JPEG with the original), and for generating three associated keys (secret splitting? something to do
with Brands' blind signatures?), I really can't imagine a way of putting it
all together. Someone will have to be inspired, as Diffie was...

The Indian Supreme Court yesterday (9th February, 1995) directed the government to create an independent autonomous regulatory body for the airwaves (like the US FCC) and end the state monopoly on broadcasting and satellite uplinks.
The judges took an interesting position that the "GREATER IMPACT" OF ELECTRONIC MEDIA and its "wider range of circulation of information" as opposed to the press, CANNOT BE USED TO RESTRICT or deny THE RIGHT TO FREE EXPRESSION. This may have important consequences, for all over the world, including in the US and India, the electronic media is denied freedoms allowed to the press with the excuse that it's somehow different.
The three-judge bench, comprising of Justices PB Sawant, S Mohan and BP Jeevan
Reddy, made the ruling after an government appeal against a previous ruling by the Calcutta High Court. The Calcutta High Court had earlier upheld the right to telecast as fundamental, which would theoretically prevent any regulation or censorship whatsoever. The consensual Supreme Court judgement,
while denying the government's power of monopoly, upheld its right to subject the electronic media to regulation and censorship. However, Justice Reddy, in his separate ruling did not mention censorship.
He pointed out that the century-old Indian Telegraph Act of 1885, which has
been ingeniously extrapolated to support the government's monopoly over electronic media and right to 'licence' data networks, was "wholly inadequate
and unsuited for" electronic media, and said that Parliament should enact
new laws to govern such media.
Unfortunately the Supreme Court has no powers to legislate, and new laws have
a habit (as seen with the Digital Telephony Bill in the US) of increasing,
rather than decreasing, government authority. The explicit statement that
the electronic media should not be more restricted than the press will, hopefully, prevent that.
The legal battle started with the Doordarshan, the state TV monopoly, objecting to the Cricket Association of Bengal's contract with Trans World
International granting the latter worldwide broadcasting rights to a cricket
tournament. Doordarshan used the 1885 Act to prevent TWI from uplinking to
satellite, till the courts intervened.

storm (Don Melvin):
That's a laugh! Yes, it would be a good idea to involve telcos in our cause, but it was my impression that most cypherpunks expressed derision for the EFF for 'compromising' (i.e. being realistic). Telcos do not necessarily share the interests of cypherpunks; they want to make money, that's all. They'd love to compromise, and provide funding for CDT, Jerry Berman's new lobbying outfit. A good example of their attitude is what they do in India, or China. Here none of them are too keen to say anything against some of our ancient and idiotic laws, and they're all happy to budget for huge and unjustified 'licence fees' because they want to lick state ass. They want to grab these huge markets before it's too late, free speech be damned.

Brad Dolan :
Clinton's recent high-profile resort to executive orders reminds me of Yeltsin's 'democracy by decree'. I await with interest an American Chechnya.
However with the latest one he seems not to be ordering anything new, he's
just pulled something out of the legislative hat, he's just using powers
he's been given under the cited subsections of the Foreign Intelligence Act.
He seems happy to follow whatever little safeguards it has. How that Act
was never ruled unconstitutional beats me. Why is Clinton kowtowing to the Notional Security Agency and the Federal
Bureau of Instigation all of a sudden? Is this a 'law-and-order' shift to
the right of a New New Democrat?
Can we all stop insulting dogs? Lawrence Detweiler can be safely refered to
as LD. Rottweilers, as a correspondent writes with "great umbrage" in last week's Time, are "handsome, noble, courageous and steadfastly loyal."
