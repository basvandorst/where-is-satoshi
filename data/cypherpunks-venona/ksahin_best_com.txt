It doesn't matter who holds the keys, the problems involved are
essentially the same.  Such powers are always abused.  Getting back to the courts, don't tell me you (joe) are intending to
give our keys to the same courts who sign wiretap orders on a whim are
you?  The courts haven't proven themselves any more trust worthy than
other branches of government.  Furthermore, it is very difficult to take
such powers out of the hands of the courts. How will you fight something
like this, take it to court? Hey! it's the RSA export-A-sig.  I can recognize it anywhere...

A credit card passes for proof of age?  I had a credit card as soon as I
was old enough to drive (it made my father's job of family accounting
easier when all of the gas payments showed up on the credit card bill)
at age 16.
A larger problem I see with credit cards being used as a form of ID is
that it may become comon practice to ask for name and credit card number
at the enterance to every contravercial site.  If so, people will begin
to abuse the system, as it is a very simple matter to start logging all
names, credit card numbers, and expiration dates of people who enter
your site, and then make charges to their credit cards.

I hear it's not ITAR anymore.  Now it's an EAR violation.  Of course, ITAR was more fun.  If you violated that law under ITAR you
can proudly wear the title of International Arms Trafficker.
