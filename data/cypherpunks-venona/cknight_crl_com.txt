I may be wrong, but I don't see it this way.  Articles and research papers that I write are copyrighted.  If I choose to distribute these in the net, it's a given that inet providers will have these stored on their drives.  But...  If you archive the net, and compile it into a different media that you then sell(presumably to make a profit), then there is a matter of copyright infringement.

I'm going to look at this in the light of past cases with reporters:  When a judge demanded the names of informants/sources, and reporters declined, they got slapped with Contempt of Court charges.
  This rarely happens anymore, since reporters get some defense from the Bill of Rights.  But for us, in these days of cutting edge legal battles, we could come out on the bottom.  Had that student refused his key, they could have probably charged him with CofP, and kept that charge in place even after they had broken the key.

So if I sell (at a profit) a netnews feed to subscribers via modem, it
is not copyright infringement, but if I sell the same data on a CDROM,
you cliam copyright infringement.  So I suppose you want to give some
kind of list of what types of media are acceptable for transmitting
netnews feeds, and which are not?  And I suppose that the Federal
Copyright Beaureau will then need to enforce a new law to make sure that
netnews is distributed only via government-approved methods.  Ahh.. I
can smell the new gummint conspiracy already.
The plain and simple fact is: When you post a message to usenet, you do
so with the expectation that others will receive it.  You can have no
way of knowing or limiting who may get it; that is given by the nature
of the network.  Usenet news is, and is intended to be, publicly
accessable information.  If there is something you don't want
distributed, then DON'T POST IT!

You didn't seem to like my thoughts about "media shift"...  Let's say the same thing in a different example...  You wrote a letter to Communications Week which was published; something you expected.  George over there runs a news stand, and he sells Communication Week; nobody has a problem with him selling magazines for a living, do we?  But, we have Bill over here who subscribed to CW, photocopies articles and letters he likes, and compiles these into a book which he then sells... Now we have a problem.
I'm not trying to draw lines, but I do see a change of media as a reason to request the author's permission to re-publish.  You would be distributing the material in a way different than the author intended.

If all you are concerned with is "Material differnce", then you think it's perfectly ok for me to sell you a good copy of a magazine?

Lost revenue can be measured in more than one way.  Besides estimated loss of sales, it can be measured in profit earned by the defendant.  If an author published a story in a magazine once, and never intends to publish it again, this does not give you the right to sell his story because he wasn't going to be making money on it anywhay.
Profanity aside, that's not an entirely logical arguemnt.  There are plenty of free publications in the US that contain copyrighted work.  Publishing in a "free medium" does not strip your rights.

It to me is a secure means of transferring cash from one account to another.  If you see a chech as money, I am pretty sure you won't agree with me.
  A check in itself is almost useless until rendered to a bank.  It is not legal tender.  You can't use a third party check at the store.  You can only deposit (transfer funds) or cash it (exchange for legal tender).  CypherBucks will probably go the same way.  If you issue me a transfer token, I won't be able to pass it off to Sandy since she won't be able to validate it's value, only the CypherBank will; so there will be no third party CypherBucks.  This brings it a little farther from legal tender.
