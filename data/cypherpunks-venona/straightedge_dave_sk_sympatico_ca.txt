I'm Canadian, and I am really scared by what is going on in the States. If the US gooberment
succeeds in banning/controlling crypto, how long will it be before it happens here. Does anyone
know if the Canadi-humm gooberment is trying to do ban/control crypto?
And to the person who wrote this I have one word: A-F*CKIN-Men!

This is my sarcastic reply to the article.. has a couple of interesting
'facts' about canadian life.. Enjoy!
Hey we don't even have a Canadian version of Sesame Street anymore.. The
government controlled TV station (that CBC) decided that the content of the
Canadian version of Sesame Street was still to American... (Like 5 year
olds know the difference!)
Okay, so if I get a video feed of the internet is that illegal in Canada?
You bet!! Even PGP-fone is.. after all, telephones are designed for voice
communication, the internet is for data. All praise the High and Mighty CRTC. Shit! no more WIRED Magazine & No more comic books...
Yup.. but the government thinks we're all after free TV.. Even those of us
who don't even have "Basic cable", and have just the three free channels...
(All I need is my Simpson's :) Yup -- Canadians love to pay tax, that's why we pay so much of it.. ( well
over half of a Canadian citizen's income is taxes. If the average Canadian
were to devote 100% of their paychecks to their taxes for the year, they
would start seeing some income in the middle of July. For the first six
plus months of the year, they would be paying taxes. I believe that Simon
Fraser University does the calcuations each year..
Don't forget Much Music.. I need my MTV oops muchmusic...
No, the problem is not canadian content, the problem is the percieved
canadian content. A lot of Canadians think that canadian culture is under
constant attack from the US. After all how many magazines are canadian? how
much of the music on the Radio is Cancon (canadian content)? How much of
the news we get from the newspaper is Canadian? Also, seeing that most of
the people in canada (except for the aboriginals) are of European Decent,
just like the US.. what does it matter anyway? What the CRTC fails to
realize is that canadian culture will do fine even if as Canadians we get
American satellite.....

We can all pray for the day when law enforcement, and government personel
wake up one morning, realise what they are and shoot themselves.
Then again, they are all such nice people, why would we want them to do that..
Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach. Those that know nothing about
anything, lead..

@_subject: Jim Bell & e-commerce 
I'm fairly new to the list and to crypto/political issues.. question one: What did Jim Bell do that go him into trouble?
question two: If all non-key-escrow crypto systems become banned, won't
that make e-commerce illegal? "You can take my PGP when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers"
