NPR's "Weekend Edition/Saturday" has an insubstantial piece on Phyber Optik on today's program, check local NPR times/listings.
Nexis-hunters might want to check out a manifestly stupid editorial in
today's Hartford (CT) Courant, significant only because it is the (L-A
Times-owned) paper of record in the state of greatest wealth in the U-S.
I would summarize it, but I don't understand it; something to do with
shrink-wrap copyrights and digital cash. Fax copies sent to interested parties, just give me a number.

WiReD. What a waste of pulp; worse, what a waste of potential. A magazine that could have held the hands of aol novices and led them into the real net.world, and promoted freenets, and demonstrated the need for cryptosystems, and challenged the minds of net citizens decided to take the low road and become "USA Today" (for cypherpunks abroad, "USA-T" is a `newspaper' that looks like a big comic book, and doesn't trouble its readers with many syllables ... rather like Prodigy ...).
