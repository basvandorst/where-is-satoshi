Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume
your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing
lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.)
assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline
members.  Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.
1st level--your 10 members with $5...........................$50
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100...............$500
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000).........$5,000
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000).....$50,000

*******TIPS FOR SUCCESS*******
 *  TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, professional, and follow
directions accurately.
 *  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when
orders start coming in because:
    When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested
product/report to comply with the U.S. Postal & Lottery Laws, Title
18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18,  Section 3005 in the U.S. Code,
Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state that
product or service must be exchanged for money received."
 *  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.
 *  Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the
instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!
 *  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!
*******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT  within two weeks,
continue advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you
receive at least 100 orders for REPORT   If you don't, continue
advertising until you do.  Once you have received 100 or more orders
REPORT  YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for
you, and
the cash will
continue to roll in!
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front
a DIFFERENT report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching
report people are ordering from you.  If you want to generate more income,
send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again!  There
no limit to the income you will generate from this business!
NOTE:  If you need help with starting a business, registering a business
name, how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local office of
Small Business Administration (a Federal agency) for free help and answers
to questions. Also, the Internal Revenue Service offers free help via
telephone and free seminars about business taxes.

     This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially
the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it
work and you'll lose a lot of potential income.  I'm living proof that
works.  It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money,
little cost to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program
exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.

     My name is Frank. My wife, Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD. I
am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good
money. When I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving "junk
mail ". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work. Doris totally ignored
my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless
fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing
didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within two weeks she had
received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200
in $5 bills! I was shocked!  I was sure that I had it all figured and that
it wouldn't work.  I AM a believer now. I have joined Doris in her "hobby."
  I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat
race" and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM.

    I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you.
 Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. I even checked
with the U.S. Post Office to verify that the plan was legal. It definitely
is! IT WORKS!!!
           Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC
    The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system
is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount
of money in a short time. I was approached several times before I checked
this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00
in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.
         Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.
    Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up
my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided
that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that
I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I
surprised when I found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders!
For awhile, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail
at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life
before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where
in the U.S. the people live. There simply isn't a better investment with
a faster return.

    I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered
if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to
contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another
program...11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I
made more than $41,000 on the first try!!
          D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN
 This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit
our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest
on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if
you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden
opportunity.  Good luck and happy spending!
