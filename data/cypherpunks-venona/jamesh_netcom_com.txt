Let's try this again...
And the pedophile was named Craig Shergold?
Seriously, this "Pedophile uses net to lure rape victims" is reaching
the status of some kind of Law Enforcement/Urban Legend. Sort of the
Willie Horton of the nineties.
And as you'll remember, (at least those of you who follow US politics,)
Willie Horton was some kind of convicted bad guy that then-governor
Mike Dukakis released from prison on some kind of early-release program
who then went on a crime (rape? murder?) spree. This was used as a rallying point by Dukakis' opponents when he ran for president some
years later, and was arguably the one thing that insured his defeat.
(The above was from memory -- feel free to flame^H^H^H^H^Hcorrect me
if the facts aren't straight.)
Now the same technique is being used against the proponents of strong
crypto. And why not? It worked so well last time...
We need our own Willie Horton, some blatant example of why strong
crypto is a Good Thing. It would be nice to be able to pull a few
examples of Gov. wiretap abuse or mail tampering (electronic or otherwise) out of the hat whenever that pedophile story gets an airing.
Can anyone point me to something along these lines?

This brings to mind the fact that govornment agencies, as well as
private citizens, can be the victims of wiretap abuse. I would find it
hard to beleve that the TLA's aren't keeping tabs on each other. Is there other evidence of non-acceptance of clipper by U.S. Gov. agencies?

Or perhaps the propaganda had started more than two years prior the invasion.

Jim Hart>  I called Dave Lovejoy, a longtime credit manager and currently product
line manager for Data Rental's line of credit retrieval terminals. He confirmed
for me what I had always understood; with _secured_ credit cards, no one
really cares who you are, as you have secured your card with a cash
deposit (typically 110% of your limit) and collection is no problem.
I have no idea as to the legalities of all this.
BTW Data Rentals is one of the major suppliers of credit retrieval equipment
to credit grantors, marketing towards the small-to-medium sized operations
(that is, those who don't buy their reports directly from the bureaus on tape.)
I wrote the software for their DRS-2000 automated credit terminal, as well
as their credit cartridge for the TI 700 printing terminal.

App. this didn't make it out to the list the first time.
Sorry if you get this twice!

Perry sez:
Which brings me to the question; "What ARE people using, and what are
they GOING to use?" Can anyone point me to a survey of the most used
ways for e-mail to get on the net, and what will be most used in the
future? The problem of insecure machines can be dealt with, but right
now I have only knowledge of the insecure machine I use for email, and
how I deal with it.
If no such surveys exist (which I find hard to believe) than I'll do
one myself.
Also, with this NII/SuperDuperHighway/Infobahn thing happening in the U.S.,
and the impending market war between Microsoft, Sega, Nintendo and
Scientific Atlanta to supply the Set Top Box that will give John Q. Consumer
his movies-on-demand and access to the SuperMall(TM) and, incidentally, his
E-mail capability, it might be a good thing to know in advance what J. Q.
Consumer will be using so that we can be there with strong, usable
crypto when he gets there.

Do we know when Voice PGP will be available? Can anyone point me to
more info about it?
I understand that "Call Security" does not include source, so I don't
think I can consider using it.
I'm wondering if I should continue writing my own.
