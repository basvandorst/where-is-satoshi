@_subject: Assassination Politics (corrected repost) 
Explanation: I am reposting this because my original post seems to
             have been inadvertantly(?) mutilated after the fact.
  Likewise, we wouldn't want your ramblings to go unchallenged, as you
might be presented as a representative of Cypherpunk/pro-crypto views.
  Maybe they deserved them.  Making politics more risky may have the
benificial effect of thinning out the ranks of politicians to truely
dedicated ones, instead of the fat parasitic beurocrats we have now.
  Given certain political views contrary to your own, the government
not only incites but commits murder daily, on a much greater scale.
Is it so wrong try to put an end to this by a little strategic
  Certainly not the government.
  You're completely off the mark.  Have you read his essay at -
  He cited government officials involved in Waco, Ruby Ridge, and the IRS
as examples.  But, he clearly stated that:
 "It would be impossible, for example, to set up some sort of
  "Assassination Politics Dictator," who decides who will live and who will
  die, because competition in the system will always rise to supply every
  demand, albeit at possibly a very high price.  And if you believe the maxim
  that "absolute power corrupts absolutely," you wouldn't want to accept any
  form of centralized control (even, perhaps, that of your own!), because any
  such control would eventually be corrupted.  Most rational people recognize
  this, and I do too.  I would not have invented a system where "Jim
  Bell" gets to make "all the decisions."  Quite the contrary, the system I've
  described absolutely prevents such centralization.  That, quite frankly, is
  the novelty and dare I say it, the beauty of this idea.  I believe that it
  simply cannot be hijacked by centralized political control.
  As I pointed out in the essay, if _I_ were running one of the organizations
  accepting those donations and offering those prizes, I would selectively
  list only those targets who I am genuinely satisfied are guilty of the
  violation of the "non-agression principle."  But as a practical matter,
  there is no way that I could stop a DIFFERENT organization from being set up
  and operating under DIFFERENT moral and ethical principles, especially if it operated
  anonymously, as I antipate the "Assassination Politics"-type  systems will
  be.   Thus, I'm forced to accept the reality that I can't dictate a
  "strongly limited" system that would "guarantee" no "unjustified" deaths:  I
  can merely control my little piece of the earth and not assist in the abuse
  of others."
  If this is so impossible, then why do you later claim that:
"I have plenty to worry about, Bells plan would lead to murder of
innocent people."?
  You do have a point, though.  The actual payment would be hard to
enforce.  This is just a technical difficulty that can be overcome with
dedicated effort.  The idea is sound in all other ways.
  Ever heard of "virtual corporations"?  They may exist without heed
to national borders.  The technical means also exist for complete
anonymity on the internet, so that even the location of servers
may be concealed (via. Onion Routers, and their ilk).  Besides,
all interaction with the corporation could be conducted through
email, for which a rather high degree of anonymity exists already.
  This is debatable, as much as you fasion yourself the arbiter of
what is possible.
  Assassination transactions against anyone can be carried out
anonymously right as we speak.  There are absolutely no safeguards against that.  However, AP is different.
  AP calls for a large pool of money donated in generally small ammounts by large numbers of individuals.  The incentive for killing officials who garner retribution from whole populations would be much greater than that of some random individual.
  H.L.Machen perceptively noted, "It is a common fallacy of our time that a moron run through a university and decorated with a PHD will thereby cease to be a moron."  So save your credentials for
the tabloids.
  Ah, I see that you are in agreement with some of the framers of our
great constitution in rejecting Direct Democracy, in favor of
one or another flavor of elitism (Representative Democracy, lets say).
Not that it's necessarily so bad, mind you, but at least you're showing
your true colors.
  The state has no rights.  It is not a living individual.  Only humans,
and arguably animals, have rights.
  You're right.  It is not the American Way of justice.  However,
that way is not itself above suspicion.  The reliability of witnesses
is suspect, even when they are sincere in trying to recall events.
The judges are not above corruption, especially as they are in positions
of power and power corrupts.  Finally, the jury is not without its
biases, even when its not also paid off, as can be seen from the
controversial results of well publicised cases involving Rodney King
and O.J.Simpson.
  This may or may not be true.  Some donations to AP organisations may
have no basis in fact whatsoever.  The public is verry malleable, I'll
grant you.  However, others, such as large scale repression, will
have very real basis in fact.  Imagine the will of the Black people
being harnessed through AP organizations during American Slavery.
  Of course.  However, the state employees are few.  The subjects,
or "beneficiaries" of the state are many.
  Of course it does, I don't think you've read closely enough.  Perhaps
you should stick to Nuclear Physics and Electrical Engineering.
Scientists are notorious for not "getting" ethics, or completely
ignoring them in wanting to stick to "pure" science.
  Obviously, Paul is speaking of crime from Jim Bell's "ethical theory"
perspective.  Phil discounts the existence of that perspective, and answers from a "real world" perspective, completely missing Paul's point.
  The state is self-perpetuating.  Threats to the well being of members
of it are taken seriously, that's no surprise.  It would be surprising
for the subjects of this state to wake up and pre-emtively protect
themselves from the state.
  You didn't answer his question.
  Ah, sanity.  The Crusades seemed sane to the Christians.
The Holocaust to the Nazis.  Communism to the Russians.  And now,
a police state to the Americans.
You're such a good patriot.
  More elitism!  Well, we're all lucky we have you, the agents at Waco and
Ruby Ridge, and the IRS to protect us.  Perhaps you'll do us all a favor
and judge yourself superfluous and even harmful to "the people's cause"
and put a contract on yourselves in an AP organization, when they come
to be.  I thought not.  All we'll see are attempts are self perpetuation.
  Again, what do you have to worry about if, as you say, "Bell's scheme is entirely preposterous"?

Are you kidding? With the exception of export controls, we DO have
it our way now. If we let them have it at all, we will NEVER have
it our way. Any legislation at all, no matter what it says, is bad.
Under no circumstances should any right or liberty be sacrificed so that
we can export crypto. One of the principal reasons for export control
is to prevent the widespread deployment of strong crypto IN the U.S.
It seems they are willing to lift export controls if we all lie down
and let them impose controls on domestic use. No thanks. Fuck RSA. Fuck Netscape. Fuck M$. I'm not gonna give up my ability to use crypto
so they can make more money.

This was a step in the right direction.  The response of the USG has
been to pretend it isn't happening.
However, if 1000 people announced publically and openly that on a
certain date they were all going to post it to this and similar lists,
it would have a strong political impact, particularly if followed
regularly by longer works of mathematics.  Of course, if the "RSA in 3
lines" posting is considered a done deal, it may be time to move on to
longer postings.
The fact is the USG has been reluctant to make any overt moves.
Instead, they have tried to quietly put in "the crypto fix" without
making too many waves.  Over and over again we have seen their lack of
confidence in their ability to get away with making some math illegal.
It may be the case that a number of mass postings of mathematics,
which anybody can look at and see to be harmless, is all that it will
take to finish off the whole ridiculous scheme.
Simple ridicule has its value, but what I intend is the use of
organized civil disobediance as a political action, and one which is
almost impossible for thugs to respond to, particularly in time of
peace.  The nice thing about this form of civil disobediance is that
it occurs on the Net in the most public way so that it will be very
difficult for the newspapers to misrepresent what is going on.
Ironically, the very people who lay awake at night worrying about
whether factoring is hard are the least likely to take risks!
Nobody wants to be the first one to cross the line and be arrested.
Fortunately, posting is easy and anybody can participate.  Nobody has
to be (in any meaningful way) the first to go.
There is simply no way that the government will be able to lock up
1000s of professors, grad students, businessmen, programmers, or
politicians for sharing mathematics when in the consensual
hallucination we call the news, the country is being overrun by
violent criminals.
Maybe July 4 would be a good date?

@_subject: Remailer messages of variable length 
To complicate traffic analysis Sender can add a padding to his message
before encrypting it for some remailer in chain. So that the
message is shortened after decryption and stripping of pseudo headers.
It can be done with a dummy header lines:
Padding: fjx6zRURnnK1DV4CdL7gbHpnUiV1KbbRf5HatXiaD+ZPtH0 ...
Also, for a length increment a remailer may understand commands like:
Pad-length: 1K
Pad-encrypt-for: remailer
It will then add the 'Padding:' header and re-encrypt the message with
the appropriate remailer's public key. The next remailer in chain will see
the padding and will try do decrypt the message twice...
If stealth crypto is used, a random padding can be simply attached to the
end of the message.
Also, the remailer by itself can decide to increase a message length to
cover some rare big messages.

I recently applied for a U.S. passport and, as an experiment,
entered a SSN of 000-00-0000.  The nice lady at the counter informed
me that it would not be processed unless I provided a valid SSN (which
gets forwarded to the IRS).  It was my understanding that this
disclosure was voluntary and that another form was available for
notifying the IRS that a passport had been applied for.
     My travel plans didn't allow me the luxury of delaying the
application process, so I provided the damn number.  Does anyone know
the real rules for this situation?  Must passports be cleared with the
tax goons or do they just want to keep tabs on people travelling
