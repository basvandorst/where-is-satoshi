No, I was referring to a case, where a third party game cartridges manufacturer  reverse engineered the specifications of the game cartridges slot for producing  his own cartridges for this game.
Unfortunatly, I have lost the reference and the names of the companies, but  this is the main case cited when it comes to reverse engineering propriety  schemes. Maybe I can dig this out, or another member of the list has details    Wolfgang
