OK, I give up - what is the key I need to get on this list, I've tried cypherpunks-request and listserv
but neither account exists. Can someone please add me to it.
- Mitra
P.S. If you reply, do so by email to mitra not to the list, as I cant receive the list yet :-)

I've had this list gatewayed into a newsgroup locally since it started, as long as people are reasonably disciplined (what us, disciplined) about
keeping the same subject line, then the volume of this list is quite managable.
OTOH - there is no way I could have handled this volume in my regular mailbox.

Sure Eric, I'm on SCO unix (i.e. non compatible with everyone else - I cant even get perl running yet), I've added the following lines to my .maildelivery
To	cypherpunks	|	A	inews -0 -a list -n list.cypherpunks
Cc	cypherpunks	|	A	inews -0 -a list -n list.cypherpunks
Apparently-To	cypherpunks	|	A	inews -0 -a list -n list.cypherpunks
This catches the three most common address headers, unfortunately the
mailing list at cypherpunks doesnt behave like a well-behaved reflecter
should and put its own address in the header (most would add "Sender:
All this does is pipe messages that match the headers into inews with the args
following. Those args are:
-0	An extension I added, which makes inews always return 0 (otherwise
-a list	Add an "Approved: list" line so that inews will post it to a moderated
-n list.cypherpunks	Stick it in the newsgroup "list.cypherpunks"
list.cypherpunks is set up moderated, with the moderater being Happy gatewaying, if someone has a better way of doing this then let me - Mitra

I thought that was the point of PEM? Why not integrate the PGP
