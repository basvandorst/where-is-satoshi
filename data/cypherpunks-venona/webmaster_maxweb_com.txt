My bad. You were serious. But still...
It accualy said that in the article? "CULTURE OF TRUST"? Not even our own
government trusts us enough to share enough information with people outside
the US so we can talk to them WITHOUT letting big brother watch. You hear
about all this scandal with the NSA/GOV and that swiss encryption company?
It says right in every piece i've seen that "this went on for many
years"... 5 or 6 I believe... Mozilla (NS), IE, and many other less well known (but certianly as popular)
WEB browsers have encryption built right into them, so you can do things
"Securely". Nobody uses their real name on the internet, unless it's for
buisness, and Login/Password lurks around the corner if you know where to
look for it. Is this indicative of a "culture of trust"? Naturally this is in compareison to the internet's predacessor (Not
ARPAnet, that was a government project. BBS's came first)
, which were mostly free to anyone who came and wanted to dl/ul a
file or post in the message base. And usally if it wasn't open you could
apply for access. People ran this software, and everyone knew it was full of holes, and
anyone could format all the hard drives in your box, but they trusted the
total strangers who were calling not to, and for the most part people
DIDN'T... simply because they liked it and didn't want to see it go away.
It used to be that identification was only required when it was necessary
to do something that REQUIRED identification, and half the time there was
an anonymous option hiding somewhere... Now if I want to download some
shareware of the "culture of trust", I gotta type in my name, vital
statics, SIN, rank, mothers maiden name, what I know about the plot to
assisinate Mr.Cigar, and a 3 page essay on why I deserve to use their
shareware that they worked long and hard to make and I'll never pay for.
It's enough to make you NOT want to do it. But we do. We keep comming back
for that thrill of watching the [Percent Complete] box stay at 97% for
hours on end until Windows plays a cheery little tune and pops up a box

I think the impact of the strike on December 14 against the Wassenaar
Arrangement has been greatly under-estimated. Even though I can only
comfirm a handfull of brave souls may have supported the cause, the
discussion about it was enough to raise awareness. And wasn't that the point?
I submit this as proof for your aproval:

December 14, 1998 Wassenaar Pact May Threaten Global
E-com By Jim Kerstetter - PC Week Could a treaty banning the use of strong encryption put
the screws, once again, to the U.S. encryption industry?
Cryptographers and others in the security industry worry
that that could be exactly what is happening.
The Clinton administration this month, in an about-face to
indications that it was loosening its grip on encryption,
announced the signing of a treaty with 32 countries called
the Wassenaar Arrangement. The treaty would limit key
lengths to 64 bits or less.
Clinton administration officials said the treaty will, for the
first time, level the playing field for U.S. companies trying
to sell abroad. That's true, to a point. U.S. companies
have long complained that they were unfairly hampered by
the lack of restrictions in other countries. What they had
hoped would happen--and what the administration
seemed to be edging toward--was an easing of U.S.
export laws. They never asked for stronger controls in
other countries.
The Wassenaar Agreement broadsided many who had
watched the Clinton administration over recent years
grant export licenses for strong encryption products to
companies such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Netscape
Communications Corp.
Jeff Smith, general counsel of the Washington industry
group Americans for Computer Privacy, said in a
statement the treaty is a welcome attempt to level the
playing field, but "it also demonstrates flaws in our
government's encryption export policies."
Security status quo So what does it mean if the agreement does become
law? For starters, it would not cut the use of unbreakable
encryption. The Data Encryption Standard, the U.S. standard for symmetric, or
private-key, encryption, has been broken at 56 bits. No one has publicly
acknowledged breaking a DES key longer than that. The Triple DES key,
commonly used in the United States, would continue to be illegal for export. Ironically, the government's own proposed Advanced Encryption Standard, which
is expected to replace DES in about two years, would not be allowed for
It's not clear what the treaty will mean to companies that have already been
granted export licenses either for strong encryption--the
encryption that has been exempt in the past--or for authentication mechanisms
that usually take 1,024 bits.
In other words, the treaty would reinforce the status quo in the United
Elsewhere around the world, it could be a different story. Of the 32 other
nations, several, such as the United Kingdom and Japan, already have strong
encryption controls. But others, such as Germany, have virtually no export
controls, and companies there could be seriously impacted.
About 18 months ago, the control of encryption products was taken out of the
hands of the U.S. Department of Defense, which had long considered encryption
a munition, and handed to the Commerce Department. Although the result was
often the same--the DOD, the National Security Agency, the CIA and the FBI
still had a say in what could and could not be exported--the shift of
control was considered by many to be a sign that the administration was
growing more friendly to industry concerns.
Those hopes were further bolstered when export limits were raised from 40
bits to 56 bits, when financial institutions where allowed to use whatever
they wanted to protect transactions and when a long list of companies
gained export approval.
But the Wassenaar Agreement, which must still be approved by Congress and
legislative bodies in most of the participating countries, would put the
brakes on that road to government deregulation.

@_subject: Re: Question about 'TEMPEST': UPS 
While I can't anwser that question, I do know of a technique where you look
at the rises and falls in resistance on an ic (like a cpu, or other
microprosser) and be able to tell what instructions were being executed.
The problem was that you needed to
A) Know what instructions were being executed so you could assign them to
different patterns (calibrate first).
B) Do A every time you switch ic's. (recalibrate every time you change ic's)
Of corse you need a clean power supply to begin with, and some way to
measure nearly imperceptable changes in resistance.
There once was a file I read on "Real Programmers (substutite with any
computer profession).
This is from my memory so don't quote me:
Real Programmers don't eat quiche.
They eat microwave popcorn.
Real Programmers don't pop their microwave popcorn in microwaves.
They use the heat of the cpu.
Real Programmers don't use Gate Emulators.
They can tell what instruction is being executed at any given time by the
rate of the popcorn popping.
I thought it was appropiate.

Several months ago, someone was talking about "True random numbers" and how
to obtain them, and I (rather ignorantly) suggested they run a recorded
sound through a program to record a 1 for every peak of volume over a
certian threshold , and a 0 for every thing quieter.(I think i suggested a
russeling tree, or a waterfall) Just adjust the threshold according to the
volume of your sampling. (it was clear in my mind, even if I can't explain
it here)
