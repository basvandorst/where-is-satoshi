  Here's a variation, then: Instead of using process-id.clock to

challenges and hashes on the server.
  The password file is kept encrypted, and only decrypted to run the

@_subject: Universal Password System? 
I was thinking some more (look out, this could be dangerous) about the
concept of using some kind of H(challenge+password) system to keep
passwords away from ____(your threat model here)____, when it hit me
that we could devise a standard password system, which would allow Joe
Schmoe to have a single password for all of his interactions with
  Ideally, Joe would need a "smart card" or PDA with IR link (this could
even be the proverbial Windows Watch) that would not need to keep the
actual passphrase at all (but would insure against a compromised system
recording keystrokes) that would keep the pubkeys of all systems with
which he has accounts. It would also need to be able to display in
decimal and hex for systems without the IR link.
  When he is making connections to a new system, the system will give
him its S and RSA or other public key K, so that the smart card can
compute K( H(S+P) ), and send that as the password. To the system, Q =
K"( K( H(S+P) ) ) =is= the password, but Joe only needs to remember P
for everything.
  From then on, logons will include the system sending S and a
non-reproducible challenge  (where C is iterated
less-frequently and D is time.of.day) and the smart card responding with
K( H( D + H(C+Q) ) ). As you may recall, the idea of the multi-part
challenge was so as to allow the admin of the system to store Q
remotely, and keep C -of-the-day and H(C+Q) for each user on the system
itself. With appropriate safeguards (a physical switch on the case of
the system which kills the NVRAM chip with the key for the secure file
system, this would seem to be Pretty Secure.
  The system is extensible, allowing further nesting of challenge parts
within the hash/concatenation function, so that layers of security can
be used, if anyone can find an application for them. The basic principle
of the master passphrase for all uses would make it easier to get Joe to
use one that he can remember, without giving up anything to corrupt
administrators (I have a hell of a time remembering all the passwords
for every system, and must let the comm program remember them,
protecting it with another password.  Messy.)

representing Dollars , (Swiss) Franks, Deutschmarks, and Yen,

C'punks:
                [Wait!  This =is= crypto-related!  I promise!]
  Heard on the news today that Bernard Nussbaum said he had done
"nothing irregular" in going through Vince Foster's effects immediately
after his demise, in order to secure "sensitive information".
Presumably, Nussbaum's contention is that some of the information in
Foster's possession was covered by attorney-client privelege, and
therefore the Authorities had no right to take it into possession.
                 (IANAL-Comments from those who are?)
  Anyway, this case got me to thinking: If Vince had kept all his
"sensitive" things encrypted, and never written down the passphrase,
then the data would effectively have died with him. In this case, lack
of key escrow is not a bug, but a feature!
  Then I thought some more - that the whole Key Escrow thing needs to be
rethought: Instead of escrowing the private key, we need to develop
better key management techniques for multiple recipients.
  For example, if Alice is an attorney representing Carol Client, Bob
and Ray are partners in Alice's firm, which uses escrow agent E; and A,
B, C, R and E are the public keys (and A'... are the private keys) of
our dramatis personae:
  Carol sends her message to Alice as usual, generating the session key
S, and encrypting it S'=A(S).
  Whenever Alice recieves a message, after decrypting the session key
[S= A'(S')] she adds to it an additional S"= E( B(S) ) and S"'= E( R(S)
) or some other construct which involving Shamir Sharing or whatever.
The details of the protocol(s) can be worked out after the basic premise:
       There is no reason for anyone to give up the "master key" to all
     of their business, when the minimal overhead in storage space for
     adding an escrowed =session= key will suffice.
  PGP needs a mechanism to handle "detatched session keys", so that our
escrow agent can, upon notification by Bob and Ray that Alice has [died
and R(S), so that Bob and Ray can carry on their work. Just as with a
detatched signature certificate going to a notary, the detatched session
key does not give the escrow agent any knowledge of the content of the
message itself.
  Another option is to put the whole creation of S" and S"' on to Carol,
which requires a public key that specifies E and {B, R}, as well as the
particular escrow protocol involved. This could be tricky to implement.
  Also, Carol needs to be able to specify to Alice that she is retaining
a copy of the communication, encrypted to self, and therefore Alice need
not escrow the session key for this particular message.

  In fact, I would like to see provision made for a digital signature to
have an expiration date included, so that the SoS office could have its

  Here's a thought or twelve: Precompute the divsion-of-keyspace
problem, in advance of the actual issue of challenge. Use whatever
criteria of estimating spare mips (idle_percentage * mips_rate) and
allocating slices, then issue each participant a [start..end] space
(and a direction flag. More on this later).
  That way, when the challenge is issued, there is no fumbling about,
but rather a simple: "Gentlemen, start your programs."
  Divide the participants into two roughly equal groups of total spare
mips, so as to address reliability and trust issues. Then allocate the
entire keyspace twice.
  Later...
  For more fun, if the cracker can be coded to read a direction flag
from the config file, so that the main loop can go ++ or --, the
lists of keyspace could alternate thusly:
       Red Team   Blue Team
        0000++     0000++
        --iiii     --jjjj         This method of allocating keyspace
        iiii++     jjjj++       puts the key in the space of 4
        --kkkk     --mmmm       different people at once, but only
        kkkk++     mmmm++       increases average search time by a
              . . .             factor of 2 to protect against holes.
      / --0000     --0000       since the direction flag is independent of
    / \ (FFFF--)   (FFFF--)     team, it reveals nothing to a Bad Guy.

 Two ways of saying the same thing.
  In effect, the ranges computed by the allocator are paired up, and the
two people who share the range play "meet in the middle". If there are n
participants in the group, and b of them are Bad Guys, the probablity of

  Actually, this is what qualifies as a "wicked problem". Until pgp 1.0
came along, there was no way to know how people would =actually= use a
public-key system. (Sure, there were lots of theories, and a few
academic experiments, but those don't count as RL.)
  Phil tried to anticipate the kinds of errors that would be made by
people unaccustomed to thinking in terms of attacks and threat models.
Face it, the average.net.person is not into game theory. Phil was under
severe time pressure to get a workable public key system out the door
before the government slammed it shut in his face.
  Now that we have had an opportunity to observe people using the
system, we can identify nuances that could never have been debugged on
the test bench. We can explain to people the various paradigms for
viewing keys, and the importance of being able to trust the "identity"
of an anon.id, which seems oxymoronic on the face of it.
  Some kind of explanation by analogy seems in order: We all know of
movie stars who changed their names for Show Biz, or authors who wrote
under pseudonyms. Take Mark Twain for example. A person who had read a
Twain book, or had friends (his own WOT) tell him how good/bad Twain
books were, would develop his opinion of the man's work. His ultimate
decision to (not) buy a particular Twain book has nothing to do with
the True Name of Mr. Clemens.
  Where it =does= come into play is in the realm of law. Had Twain
libelled a person, the means to identify the Man behind the Mask would
be integral to executing the judgement of the court. And even then, if
there were sufficient continuing royalties that could be attatched to
satisfy the judgement, it would only be necessary to know the True Name
of the publisher.
  So we must be very careful of what it is that we are certifying when
we sign something. This is what needs to be addressed in future versions
of PGP.

  As I watch you fumbling for keyspace IN REAL TIME....
  This is a great time for me to say "I told you so" WRT the doling of
keyspace. It is far better to sign up your volunteers, CHECK THE
ALLOCATION, and hand out starting keys, before there is even a challenge
to brute.
  The quad-coverage scheme I outlined before allows sufficient
protection against dropouts (whether accidental or malicious), so that a
single person who asked for some keyspace, but was unable to actually
sweep it, would not hurt the effort.
  Those who fail to ACK (once it is certain that the client does in fact
issue it - should have some parallel means of acking) should have their
allocation, based on my evolving formula
        available_mips = mips * idle_rate * .5**(unacks/sweeps)
for the next challenge reduced, reflecting previous unreliability. Set
up a sign-up period, add up the total available mips, figure the share
that each person should get, and assign keyspace accordingly via direct
Imail to each participant.
       The next level of abstraction is to not only give a start..end
     and direction, as I previously outlined, but supply a scaling
     factor in the challenge release. That way, any late entries can
     automagically be inserted into the keyspace, by squeezing everyone
     according to the final total of available_mips.
  Once the proverbial clock is running, there should be no need to
discuss who will do what. That is what the huddle is for. Or, to string
along the analogy, I guess Steve Young should just go up to the line,
take the ball from center, and then give hand signals to Jerry Rice
while a 300-pound defensive lineman is zeroing in on him, because the
linemen are standing around wondering whom to block.
  Geez. It would be better not to even have a damned keyserver at all,
but to just have everybody pick a random start location, than to do it
this way.

  The best advantage of the random method is that it allows people to

  More like deciding ahead of time that if you are going to take 1/n of
the keyspace, you should take a chunk aligned on a 1/n boundary. That
way, you don't have two people take chunks right next to each other,
just missing the key, or take chunks that overlap each other massively,
duplicating effort.
  If a random protocol were to be used, each person would roll up an
appropriate starting spot, and then simply search sequentially
thereafter, so that he would not double up on his =own= previous
efforts. The point of scaling the starting point is basically the theory
that says:
     "I will generate a random number of the form xxxxxx0000, because if
     I trust that a person has scanned any given number, I also trust
     that he has scanned the next FFFF keys, so it would be
     counterproductive for me to start anywhere not so aligned."
  And the number of 0s is based on my pathetic amount of computing power
being estimated as 2**(-24) of the total effort. For those who made the
Big Boys list, a few more zeros are in order.

  It should improve the odds just a bit. Instead of throwing darts at

with large darts to throw can worry about, say, 2**16 or even 2**12

  You've got it backwards. The problem that I originally posited was a
corrupt key escrow agent using my signature key to forge a document. The
fact that my signature pubkey could be used to encrypt messages to me is
not particularly relevant. My employer could set up filters to keep me
from recieving email on company time that is not encrypted to a key that
the corporate escrow authority has in its possession.  NBD.
  My concern here is with the NGACK situation. Companies have valid
reasons to want escrow for their own purposes. I'm just warning people
not to accept a signature key being escrowed by =anyone=. When you
create a key to be escrowed, make sure the userid includes something
like [Not Valid For Signatures].
