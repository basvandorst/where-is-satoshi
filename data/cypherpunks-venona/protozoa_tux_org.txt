The Hasty Pudding Cipher
"NIST is organizing the search for a new block cipher, the Advanced
Encryption Standard.  The Hasty Pudding Cipher is my entry in the AES
competition.  The design goals for HPC are medium security, speed, and
flexibility.  Hasty Pudding works with any block length and any key
size.  It is optimized for 64-bit architectures, operating at 200 MHz
on large data blocks.  Hasty Pudding introduces a new feature, Spice,
which allows useful non-expanding encryption of small blocks, even
single bits.  The cipher includes some unusual design principles."
Location:  Electronic Privacy Information Center
To get into the building, go around to the 7th street side next to the
flower shop and use the call box to call the EPIC office.  We'll buzz you
True to DCCP form, we'll probably hit a local resturaunt afterwards for dinner.
