I know that the PBX my school is behind shows up in the outside world as one
of a limited set of trunk numbers.  This means that calls to the real world will show up as a number other than the one you are calling from, and also that it is not likely to be the same number on any given pair of calls.  A friend discovered this when dealing with an AT&T long-distance relay operator.  They have an 800 number you call, and then they will bill the number that their ANI pulls off. I should think that AT&T of all people
 would have a good enough system that if it were possible to get the number
 they would manage it.  The Operator, whom my friend knew, commented that the number was odd, and this led to some expirmentation which confirmed the number was not his, and a couple of other similiar things.
I would suspect that there are many other PBX's which operate in a similiar manner.

Thus spake SINCLAIR  DOUGLAS N :
Couldn't each message have a short header, which is encrypted with the final recipent's public key?  When you go to retrieve mail from the haven, you request the complete list of headers (or at least those that are new). If you can decrypt the header, then the message is for you.  You then request that those messages, and also some random messages, be sent to you. If the sender uses one or more current-style remailers to send his/her message to the haven, it would much more difficult to work out a map of who is talking to whom.
