According to Graham Toal:
Ah, but the UK is starting to catch up with the US even in this. Over the
last couple of years I've noticed an increasing number of merchants who
skip the signature check for small purchases; on a couple of occasions recently I've even had my card returned to me BEFORE I'd signed the sales voucher (exactly like the normal US practice). Each time I've been tempted to use an "alternative" signature just to see what the response was, but lost
my nerve at the last moment. It'd be interesting to find out who's liable
for a debt incurred by Mickey Mouse on my account...
