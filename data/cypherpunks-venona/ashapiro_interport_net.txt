Hold your horses, folks.
For space reasons, the Times cut my attribution to Larry (as he knows and
will tell you).  The piece was 700 words at 7:00 pm yesterday, 425 words at
7:15.  Believe me, I was sorry not to be able to credit my friend,
colleague, and former teacher.
And incidentally, it was the third-to-last graph, not the last (is this
kind of looseness with the facts a coincidence?).
Hello? in graph 2: "Communications Decency Act, the law *criminalizing*
on-line indecency..."
You're wrong or overstating the case.  PICS began as an effort -- rightly
enough -- to *respond to* and/or *stave off* laws like the CDA.  But did
the Feds "pressure" anyone to come up with PICS?  No.  I just
double-checked with someone linked to PICS's founding, who told me: "Nobody
in the federal government ever came to the 3WC and told them to create
PICS."  And even if the Feds had "pressured" someone to do so, that
wouldn't in anyway justify its speech-inhibiting design features.
Now, as to whether politicians are pressuring industry to *use* PICS and
other total filtering schemes, that's another question.
That's irrelevant, Declan.  Day-to-day, speech can be inhibited as much by
technology as by law.  In fact, you're the one who's shown us that so well
with your countless posts about the dangers of censorware.
That's not what I said.  I'm not in favor of censorship and I oppose any
attempt to *criminalize* 'indecent' speech.  But criminalize does not =
Really!  I seem to recall *you* making the argument that kids have first
amendment rights to access any information, particularly in public
facilities like libraries.  The 17 1/2 year old college freshman perhaps?
Did you change you mind?

What I meant to say, Mike, was that not all regulation, obviously, is criminal.
