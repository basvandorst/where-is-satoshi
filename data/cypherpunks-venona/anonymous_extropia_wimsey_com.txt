Here in San Jose, CA, TCI recently cut the price of "basic" cable

So the conclusion is,  cancel extended basic immediately. At worst
you're losing a vastly overpriced service; at best, you're losing

@_subject: Re: WARNING:  NON-CYPHERPUNK QUESTION 
Clark Reynard asked:
    Are there any fast, quick, reliable methods of forestalling phone
    disconnection due to failure to pay the bills, and the ugly
    reconnection fee which ensues thereupon?
I can't offer a method of *eliminating* your phone bill, but I have
been practicing a method of drastically *reducing* the charge for
local phone service.
Simply ask Pac Bell (In California) for "Lifeline" service.  The
monthly bill is $1.31, after "credits" for "inside wire repair" and
"Tel Equip" (for buying your own phone(s)).  Clark, do you think you
could afford that?
This gets you a local (outgoing) call allowance of 60 calls per month
(about 2 a day).  Unlike regular measured service, which measures (and
charges) by call *and length of call*, each of your 60 calls under
lifeline can be of unlimited length.  Back when I had a 2400 baud
modem, I frequently had single calls of 2-4 *hours* while uploading &
downloading files from various local BB's.  Calls beyond your 60-call
allowance are charged at $.08 per call.
Of course, there's a catch.  Lifeline service is only offered to
"poor" people.  You have to sign a statement every year certifying
that your combined family income doesn't exceed their guidlines. But
although they warn you that the Public Utilities Commission "may
investigate" your claim; they apparently never do! Unlike the PG&E
lifeline program, Pac Bell doesn't ask for *any* documentation of your
income like W-2 forms or copies of your tax returns.
I've been on lifeline service for *years*, I think almost since they
started offering it, back when the Bell system was broken up, and
local phone rates were raised sharply.  During most of that time, I
earned around $50,000/year.  Now I'm retired & my pension is about
$24,000, still well above the lifeline "guideline".
One caveat, I live in an area of San Jose where many of my neighbors
are working-class, a few on welfare, etc.  This scam might not work
from an address in Hillsboro, Los Gatos, or Saratoga; but who knows,
the PUC may be so incompetent and/or lazy that it might.
Considering the moral factors, if you *don't* claim lifeline
eligibility, then you are *charged* a few cents a month to pay for the
people who *do*!  You are also charged $1.75 for "access to a long
distance carrier", even if you don't call long distance. (but
lifeline customers get an offsetting credit and still have long
distance access).  So you have to choose to be a sheep or a wolf, a
victim or a victimizer, to either take unfair advantage of the system
or have it take unfair advantage of you; there is no middle ground.
Consider the pragmatic factors. Based on my experience, the chances of
getting "caught" seem remote.  If I'm ever investigated, I plan to
play dumb and claim I didn't understand the lifeline forms I signed.
Since I didn't provide any false documentation of a low income (they
didn't *ask* for any), be pretty hard to prove intent to commit fraud.
So I expect the worst that could happen is that I'd have to pay some
estimate of what my correct bill might have been less what I actually
paid.  I suspect there's a statute of limitations, which I've already
exceeded for most of the time I've been on lifeline. So this sounds
like a good bet.  If you win, you win big; if you lose, you break
even, with chances of losing being much less than 50/50.

@_author: a term I don't really agree with 
@_subject: REMAIL: Virtual remailers 
I run two remailers; one is hal and the other is
hfinney  The first one is on a system to which I have
free access, while the second is on a system for which I am paying about
$40 a month.
I feel like the second one is "stronger" politically, since I am paying
hard-earned money for it.  Also, I remember the summaries that were posted
of last year's Hacker's conference, in which it was stated that the owner
of the Portal system was eager to support remailers.  I don't know if he
realizes that he is indirectly supporting them now since I am using my
Portal account to run one, but I feel that if they get some complaints and
come to me, I might be able to get the boss to step in on my behalf.
Given this situation, it has occured to me that it would be easy to have
the caltech remailer forward all mail to the portal remailer, to be
remailed from there.  This way nobody would receive objectionable mail
from the caltech account, and no one would ask for it to be shut down.
In the past, we have had suggestions that this would be a desirable mode
of operation for our cypherpunks remailers: to have the "front ends" be
a different set of machines than the actual remailers.  It was said that
this would represent a sort of "distributed computing" environment, a
"virtual remailer" that would span the network, thus making it harder to
shut down.
I did not really agree with these arguments, since I felt that the targets
would simply be the final-remailing machines, since these are the ones
from which people would receive anonymous mail.  If they were shut down,
then other machines would have to come on-line to replace them.  Given
that such replacements actually existed, I felt that it would be better
simply to use them from the beginning as stand-alone remailers, so that
there would be more remailers out there for people to use.
Now I am faced with a concrete test of this principle, and I'm soliciting
suggestions.  Would it be better to keep my two remailers operating, even
though I might eventually have to shut one down due if complaints arise?
Or should I make one just a front-end for the other, thereby creating a
"virtual remailer" (a term I don't really agree with) which spans the
two machines and which makes it unlikely that the front-end remailer at
caltech will be terminated.
Are there any advantages to having the caltech remailer if it just feeds
into the one at portal?  I'm not sure I see much point in keeping it
operating if it performs no useful task.
On the other hand, if people do see advantages, we could create a set of
"second-tier" remailers which would be politically safe.  They would
always feed into one of the "first-tier" remailers which would be the
ones which would actually send mail.  No anonymous mail or postings
would ever come from these second-tier remailers, hence their operators,
owners, and sysops would receive no complaints.  Perhaps more people
would be willing to run remailers on this basis, knowing they were
relatively immune from political pressure.

Yes, absolutely.  This discussion may be considered tangential, but the
issue here is at the core of the cypherpunks raison d'etre.  Detweiller
seems to be tremendously confused about the source of government and
unaware of the emergence of the American State.  I personally feel that
I have zero representation in what passes for our "democratic"
government for the reasons you mention, exactly.  I find myself amazed
to encounter the numbers of "mainstream Americans" who have gradually
come to the same conclusion, independent of outside prompting.
My only hope, personally, is to fight vigorously (perhaps literally, in
due course) for the maintenance of the Bill of Rights as protection
against the tyranny of _both_ the mob and the State.  I personally see
the prospect of an electronic so-called democracy to be terrifying, a
mechanism whose technical subversion would be trivial for the State's
assets, say the NSA.  Simple manipulation by propaganda would be even
easier.  Read Orwell.  Read Zamyatin.
Cypherpunks are providing the basis for long-range, (relatively) secure
communication between those activists and thinkers who may have the
power to bring down the State and restore the individual autonomy this
nation was originally devised to foster.  In the past year I have had
the privilege to see a de facto cadre of brilliant men and women
develop from formerly isolated individuals, all thanks to computer
networks and the emergence of secure communication.  I have found
answers to questions I have been asking for twenty-five years, and
provided information that answered similar questions for others.  I have
seen the product of these private communications develop into public
statements that have demonstrably influenced the political outlooks of
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of casual computer network users.
The ability of computer networks and secure communication has in itself
empowered and radicalized an otherwise disenfranchised body of valuable
and vital Americans.
Really, this is heady stuff.  It gives me reason to stick around and
watch this country for a few more years.

will be meaningful to you, but won't identify you (like a set of
random letters). This subject does not appear in the remailed

No, they do not.  This is a myth, and you have drawn a mistaken
conclusion from your experiment.
This thread has already run off into left field by the time I got to it,
but to try to drag a little reality back in, I submit the following:
FIDOnet has within it SECURENET, which is a netmail-handling network
specifically for encrypted netmail.  Mail points not wishing to handle
PGPed or other encrypted netmail are provided with software to
automatically remove PGP netmail and re-route it into the FIDO SECURENET
FIDOnet has at least two conferences specifically for PGP and other
public-key encryption system discussions and key exchange, PUBLIC_KEYS
and KEY_DROP (if I remember correctly).
Now, the point most internet people forget is that FIDOnet hosts are
hobbyists with 100% privately-owned machines and generally pay for the
entire participation of their userbase out of their own pockets,
excepting a few who get some dollars here and there from their generous
callers.  As a completely justified consequence, they can decide if they
allow encrypted traffic _on their individual BBSs_.  In that there is
considerable fear of the consequences of illegal activity being
conducted on their BBSs via encrypted mail, many sysops (such as the one
you mention, leaving aside, for now, that he apparently confused a PGP
key with an encrypted message) do not wish to take the risk and forbid
encrypted traffic.  They also monitor e-mail, if only incidentally
during the course of routine system maintenance, and notices to this
effect are generally contained in log-on screens and new-user info
In that these sysops are extremely, _personally_ vulnerable, they are
generally more cautious than those internet folks who can hide behind
institutions and businesses.
In spite of this, there are a very large number of FIDOnet sysops who
participate in SECURENET and encourage the spread of encryption
technology to the general public.

In that FIDOnet mail points (or individual BBSs) are not required to
pass or accept encrypted FIDO traffic under FIDOnet rules, some run a
specific program that scans for the "PGP MESSAGE" string and bumps it to
a SECURENET mail hub (or, in some cases, _kills_ it).  It is not done by
individual, personal inspection - at least not at mail hub level.
Anyway, the ECPA is basically irrelevant in the BBS world, as 1] almost
every BBS states at log-on that there is no such thing as truly
"private" e-mail on the system as the sysop can, will and does see
messages in all areas, and 2] he is personally _liable_ for any illegal
activity on his BBS, so he can reasonably be expected to keep an eye on
e-mail for anything that will put his ass in a sling.
There has been a very heated war in FIDOland over PGP and other
encryption.  Considering the risk that sysops take on by permitting
secure (?) communication on their BBSs, I must say I admire their
courage when they allow it and participate on SECURENET.  Personally,
_I_ would never stick my neck out like that, though I convinced many
FIDOnet BBSs to do so for my own political and purely selfish reasons.
BTW, this message comes via FIDOnet and was originally PGP encrypted for
the remailer, and the cypherpunks mailing is converted to a
conference on a FIDO BBS where I read the message to which I am

Perhaps we misunderstand each other; I do not mean, literally, that
"hobby BBSs are exempt from ECPA," but that the situations addressed are
generally avoided by sysop policies.  Let me make sure I understand your
point; are you saying that:
1]  On a privately-owned computer...
2]  Operating a noncommercial BBS without monetary compensation...
3]  On which a repeating log-on notice informs users that all messages
    are subject to sysop viewing...
4]  Sysop/sole owner viewing of non-public (as opposed to "private")
    messages during system maintenance or monitoring for unlawful
    activity...
5]  Is prosecutable under ECPA?  If so, has such a prosecution been
    successful?

It is my understanding that noncommercial FIDOnet participants are not
in fact common carriers and that technical, legal common carrier status
requires more than simply ignoring e-mail.  I understand it also brings
more potential liabilities than FIDO can handle.
In any case, I am informed hobby sysops have been arrested and their
systems seized for allegedly illegal traffic on their systems of which
they claim to have had no knowledge.  I believe this is the case in the
CT case pending.  Even if these cases are eventually dismissed, the
legal expense and personal disruption to a private party (usually a
young person of very limited means) is catastrophic and without
practical recourse.

As I say, there seems to be a great deal more to legal "common carrier"
status than simply ignoring e-mail.  In FIDOdom common carrier status is
regarded as a much larger can of worms, with more potential problems and
liabilities for sysops than other options.

I believe you are confusing me with someone else.  I am not, nor would I
_ever_ be, a BBS sysop.  This thread gives a perfect example of why not.
As far as I can tell, it's purely a fool's errand:  Paying good money
and personal time and trouble to no better end than incurring grief and
liabilities with unpleasant, ungrateful and parasitic users, as well as
potential hassles with cops, lawyers and bureaucrats.
There's zero payback here; BBS sysops are crazy.

Here's a hot message from the real world.  Feel free to print it out and
attach it to the bathroom window so that you may save the personal
expense of buying a clue:
        Ultimately:
        The Law is irrelevant.
        Right and Wrong are irrelevant.
        Your "rights" are irrelevant.
        Ethical niceties are irrelevant.
        Mishnaic wrangling over gored oxes is irrelevant.
        Offended high principle is irrelevant.
        All that is relevant is what _happens_ to you.
        When the cops show up, you've _already_ lost.
I have been watching Law, Office and Power abuse the innocent without
remedy my entire life.  The future promises more rather than less of
this, in not the least of theatres than that of digital information
The Elansky case appears to be nonsense from this remove, something no
reasonable Constitutionalist would entertain for five minutes.  Despite
this, Elansky was held on one half million dollars bail.  It is
extremely unlikely that he will find remedy, or that his young life will
return to normal any time soon.  At best, the charges against him will
be dropped, after traumatizing his family and exhausting their finances.
He cannot win and "law enforcement" cannot lose, however absurd the
charges against him actually are.
I wonder how many BBSs were shut down, or began rigorously
"self-censoring," as a result of the Elansky publicity.
Unlike Internet's government and business sites that can hide behind
their size, or institutions of Higher Ignorance that can shield
themselves behind "academic freedom," the hobbyist BBS is a sitting duck
for any ambitious crank with a badge and an axe to grind.
A small California network, "NirvanaNet," that features encryption,
radical political discussion and "dangerous" text files had their home
node visited by the FBI earlier this year and in short order were
libeled in the local press in an inflammatory hatchet-piece as (and I
quote) "a clearinghouse for crime," despite the fact that no charges
were filed nor any criminal activity detected on the part of any
individual caller.
This harassment is probably more common than we guess.  There are a
couple of other cases I know of personally.  The chilling effect it has
is incalculable.  At least one NirvanaNet node went off line almost
immediately, another moved and there was an apparent inventory made of
the filebase with some judicious culling.
The effect - ultimately - is that it is safer for a BBS operator to risk
violating a caller's rights than to face trouble from the authorities
on some fishing expedition.
Check it out:  Earlier this year, the sysop of a BBS affiliated with an
NPR FM station discovered that two users had been using PGP for private
messages for some months.  Despite the fact that the BBS had never had a
policy on encryption, nor had any request been made by the sysop to
cease PGP traffic, both callers discovered their accounts deleted
without notice, their access denied and all public and private messages
ever made to or from either caller erased from the system.  After some
time, the sysop announced that he felt that PGP was a threat to his BBS
(and the radio station) and that he had expelled those users without
notice.  The traffic, as it turned out, consisted of the development and
testing of an e-mail PGP adaptation for QEdit, a popular text editor
used in offline reader programs.  Much of the work resident in the BBS
was destroyed.  In the uproar that followed, the panicked sysop secretly
distributed forged messages alleged to be from one of the parties,
apparently to justify his expulsion.
The fascinating thing was that when all of this came to light and the
offended parties talked of seeking legal remedy, other sysops with
critical knowledge of the affair refused to co-operate, believing that
even though the offending sysop was absolutely in the wrong, bringing
legal action against him _threatened the BBS community at large_.  The
message was clear, "Don't make a big _schande_ out of this..."
"I don't care if he did lift your wallet, don't call the cops and break
up the party."
This is the ultimate effect that meritless law enforcement harassment
has had on the BBS community. Yes, they know it, but they also know that, in the minds of most
lowbrow law-enforcement personnel, encryption is synonymous with
criminal activity.  They don't want heat.  _When the cops come, you've
already lost_.  The only question is how badly.  These sysops are
usually scrimping and saving for a new modem; they can't afford lawyers.
_To law enforcement, snooping around the messagebase looking for criminal
activity is infinitely more civic-minded and responsible than permitting
secure encryption._  Policing your callers shows more good faith (to
Constable Bubba) than permitting them terrorist PGP.
If it comes down to either having a caller pissed off or having the cops
pissed off, the bigger threat is obvious to even a seventeen-year-old
Trekkie with zits and a BBS running on his dad's old XT.
There may be a theoretical application of the ECPA that suggests a right
of some non-paying parasite to use PGP on your personally-owned BBS, but
it doesn't seem to account for much compared to a visit from knuckle-
dragging local cops responding to a busibody mom's hysterical complaint
that her kid is being sucked into a secret ring of computer terrorists
who use "spy codes."  Everyone from the NSA to the Sacramento County
Sheriff's Department has it out for PGP, and the SCSD's public
pronouncements and name-calling at Zimmermann no doubt have been
filtering down through law enforcement channels to Constable Bubba with
the message that PGP is "some computer thing" associated with California
child pornography rings.  Great.  Just what you want on your kid's hobby
BBS in small-town Alabama.

@_author: patented 
@_subject: Dr. Dobb's Editorial 
As mentioned, the December, 1993 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal has an
excellent editorial about the government investigation of PGP export
and the general crackdown on cryptography.  This issue also includes
an article by Bruce Schneier describing the IDEA encryption algorithm.
As usual with DDJ, source code is included: IDEA.C, apparently based
on PGP source.
Dr. Dobb's has published encryption source before.  A few months ago
there was an article by Burt Kaliski of RSADSI on using Montgomery
multiplication to speed up an RSA implementation.  Earlier there was
an article on the (patented) Lucas public-key system.  Both articles
had source.  No doubt there have been others as well.
Here is the text of the editorial:
    Cryptography is like one of those West Virginia subterranean fires
    that smolder along coal seams for months before flaring up above
    ground.  The current flame along the encryption firing line involves
    a pair of Federal grand jury subpoenas handed out to distributors of
    Phil Zimmermann's PGP ("Pretty Good Privacy") message signature and
    privacy software.
    Earlier this fall, the Austin Code Works (a Texas software distributor)
    and ViaCrypt (a Phoenix cryptography-tool developer) were slapped with
    demands to produce contracts, payments, correspondence, and related
    information concerning their international distribution of PGP and
    RSA cryptography source code.  Neither company was told why they must
    turn over this information, nor were they given any indication of when
    or what the next shoe to drop might be.
    For the past year Code Works has been selling Grady Ward's Moby Crypto,
    a collection of crypto software that includes PGP, RSA, MD4, DES, and
    the like.  Although not mentioned in the subpoena, Code Works has also
    been separately selling a DES encryption and decryption software
    package.  For the time being, both have been removed from Code Works'
    shelves.  ViaCrypt, on the other hand, licensed PGP from Zimmermann,
    combined it with ViaCrypt's DigiSig+ cryptographic engine, and released
    a toolkit called "ViaCrypt PGP," the first commercial PGP-based package.
    Interestingly, ViaCrypt is also a sublicensee of RSA public-key
    encryption from Public Key Partners, holder of the RSA patent and a
    big-time competitor and long-time critic of PGP.
    Ostensibly, the subpoenas are part of a U.S. Customs investigation into
    the export of PGP.  (A letter the State Department's Enforcement Branch
    fired off to the Code Works begins with, "It has come to the attention
    of this office that your company is making cryptographic source code...
    available for commercial export....")  State Department regulations
    lump cryptographic software with munitions and weapons, making it
    subject to export licenses as per International Traffic in Arms
    Regulation guidelines.  However, Code Works' current advertisements
    clearly state that both Moby Crypto and DES Encryption are "not for
    export," and ViaCrypt says sales are made "export regulations permitting."
    In short, there's no indication that either company has exported crypto
    software, leading you to believe that the investigation is really nothing
    more than a fishing expedition.
    The timing is curious, considering that the Clinton administration views
    many high-tech export rules as antiquated Cold War laws that hinder
    U.S. trade.  Consequently, the administration is rethinking export laws
    so that U.S. manufacturers can more easily export communications and
    other high-tech equipment - what's protected today may be fair game in
    a few months.  Of course, the government also wants to make it harder
    to sell high-tech military equipment to renegade countries.  Unfortunately,
    cryptography has a foot in both military and civilian communications camps.
    Neither the Code Works nor ViaCrypt had anything to do with developing
    PGP.  You could even argue that Zimmermann really isn't the "author" of
    the software.  True, he did write Version 1.0, but subsequent editions
    (2.3 is the current release) are the contributed efforts of U.S. and
    non-U.S. programmers who've created what's been described as the
    strongest, easiest-to-use encryption utility available to the public in
    source form.  There's no question that PGP was exported, but neither is
    there a hint that Zimmermann shipped it overseas.  He assiduously
    avoided the chance of _his_ exporting PGP, to the point of having other
    people upload the software to the nets.  The bottom line is that PGP
    was legally on the net and anyone with a PC and a modem could have
    moved it across international borders - just as with DES, which has
    been on the nets and authorized by the government for more than a decade.
    Still, you have to wonder why the government is taking action now.  PGP
    has been around for a couple of years.  Maybe the Feds are upset that
    Zimmermann's encryption scheme is good - PGP is thought to be stronger
    than DES, the NSA and FBI reportedly can't crack it, and the thought of
    publicly available cryptography scares the dickens out of them.  Or
    maybe the announcement of a commercial PGP-based application finally
    hitting the shelves prompted PGP's competitors to lean on the government.
    We just don't know, and the Feds aren't talking.
    The government is struggling to cope with a changing world, one in which
    technology has altered many of the old rules.  Regulations, written for
    a paper-based society, aren't adapting well to digital reality.
    International electronic networks make it hard to control software
    distribution and information dissemination.  Like wildfire, bank transfers
    and e-mail are circling the globe unfettered - and encryption is keeping
    secret the contents of these communications.  But the means by which
    Washington is attempting to maintain control over cryptography is, in
    the long run, injurious to us all.  From a business perspective, these
    tactics hobble U.S. companies from competing internationally.  More
    importantly, the First Amendment guarantees us the right to speak in
    an encrypted way and insidious attempts to douse public access to
    cryptography, cloaked under the guise of software-export investigations,
    appear to stifle those rights.

As a tax-paying colored person I share Tim's concerns about the
disposition of my tax money by the U.S. government.  My parents, who
are also colored, and many of my colored friends, relatives and
acquaintances also pay taxes.  However, given all of the questionable
governmental expenditures (clipper, et. al) that are usually talked
about, singling out "so-called 'people of color'" seems a bit
peculiar; especially as part of a recruitment drive for a cryptography
list.  Surely, there are more interesting reasons to join the list. (And, as we celebrate his birthday this weekend, let's not forget that
Martin Luther King, Jr. was a victim of FBI wiretapping).  HasnUt the
U.S. government done worse than give TimUs money to colored folk?
Just as Tim anxiously awaits the "collapse of the U.S. government,"
many colored people in our fair land once awaited an end to slavery
(a wait that ran around 300 years or more - Patience Tim).  Colored
people have thought about the U.S. government quite a bit over the
years.  Well...we'll see if strong cryptography is indeed Tim's "underground

Is there now an accepted tearline convention for the generic cypherpunks

automagically adds the host address and/or my address to all outgoing

this problem, but most of the other remailers seem to have no provisions
for excluding extraneous text and address footers.
Was there ever a "8<----(cut here)" arrangement agreed upon and

@_author: RSA decryption and signing 
@_subject: Bug in PGP MPI library 
Someone please prove me wrong, but I think there is a bug in the function
mp_modexp_crt (RSA decryption and signing) in PGP23a's MPI library. Attached to this message is a program which demonstrates the bug.
While testing Magic Money for lingering bugs, the client gave the error
"Coin from server has bad signature!" I tried again with different coins,
and the program worked. The proto.dat file had been cleared as the coins
were read, so there was no way to repeat the error.
I set up a batch file to repeatedly cycle coins between the client and the
server, backing up proto.dat each time. After an hour or so, the error
happened again, and I started tracing it. There didn't seem to be any bug
to find. For this particular coin, the unblinded coin was garbage. For any
other coin, the program worked.
I wrote this test program, bug.c, to find the error. It uses the same coin, blinding factor, public, and secret key as Magic Money was using when it crashed. The program first blinds the coin, then signs it, then unblinds it, decrypts the RSA signature, and displays the results.
If you just run "bug", Here's what happens:

@_author: needed to compile it 
@_subject: Setting up a Magic Money server 
Magic Money seems to have reached a usable state. (Open mouth, insert foot,
bite down firmly :-) ) Someone needs to set up the first server. Here's how:
You can set up a Magic Money server on any machine with a net connection.
You need to be able to run a program when mail comes in. You do not need
root access. Running a Magic Money server is no harder than running a
cypherpunks remailer. Unlike a remailer, there is no possibility of your
server being used to harass or mailbomb anyone.
Get Magic Money and PGP Tools (needed to compile it) from csn.org. Get pgptl10c.zip and mgmny10e.zip. If mgmny10e.zip isn't up yet, get mgmny10d.zip and fix the bug in mms_mint() by moving the free(fp); to the end of the function. This is the only change in version e. This version has been reported to work on both big and little endian machines. If your machine has assembly-language speedups, get them from the pgp23a
source code. Use the same defines PGP uses to compile on your machine,
and take out the NO_ASM define in my makefile. This will speed up your
server quite a bit.
Compile the client and the server. Define UPTON or one of the other modmult functions, because I have had problems with Smith's modmult. The hash file
is currently set to about half a meg. It grows if it fills up. If you need
to use less disk space, change the settings in mm.h.
Put the server program "s" in one directory, and the client program "c" in another. Put something random (i.e. unknowable to an attacker) in a file
called rand.dat in each directory. The programs won't work without this. The directories should be otherwise empty. Go to the server directory and run "s i" to initialize the server. It will
ask you for the name of your server, size of your key, name of your coins,
and denominations to use. Powers of 2 make good denominations. For example,
you might use 1,2,4,8... up to 32768. With these 16 coin values, you can
transfer any sum up to 65535 with 16 or fewer coins.
After you have entered all the information, the server generates a PGP key
pair, and an e/d list pair. Your server's ascii-armored public key is saved to bank.asc. You will need to distribute this key to everyone who wants to
use your server.
Copy bank.asc into the directory with the client. In that directory, run
"c -i" to setup the client. The client generates a key, then creates a
message "output.asc" which should be sent to the server. For example, if
"client" and "server" were subdirectories in a common directory, you could
run "s < ../client/output.asc > ../client/reply.asc" from the server's
directory. Now go back to the client directory and run "c reply.asc" to
finish setting up your client. You will be running this sequence a lot if
you play with the system, so write a script.
Your client now knows the name of your coins, and has the elist. This
information is updated automatically when the server discovers the client's
copy is out of date.
Go back to the server directory and run "s m " where x is one of your
higher-value coins. You will have problems if you are using version d and
did not fix the bug as described above. This mints a coin and writes it out
to coins.dat.
Go back to the client directory and run "c ../server/coins.dat". The client
reads the coin, checks it, and asks you for values of new coins to create.
Create several smaller coins. The client keeps prompting you until you have
created coins with a value equalling that of the old coin.
The client creates another "output.asc". Run your script to pass it through
the server, and run "c reply.asc" to process the results. The client now
takes the signed coins from the server and the blinding factors from proto.dat, and unblinds the coins. The result is written to allcoins.dat.
Now run "c -p" to withdraw coins from allcoins.dat. Enter the denominations
to withdraw, and 0 to end. Now you have a coins.dat in the client's
directory, so run "c coins.dat" to process it. It will count up the coins
you withdrew, and prompt you for new coin values again, then produce another
output.asc for the server. You can create a second client in another
directory, and pass coins from one to the other.
Try creating a "msg.txt" file in the server's directory. The client will
then display the contents of the message whenever it processes a reply from
the server. The client waits for a keypress after the message.
Now that you know the server works, set it up so that incoming mail to your
account is passed to the server, and the output from the server is sent back
to the person who sent the mail. If you want to use the same account for
the server and regular mail, have users put a specific word in the subject
line of messages to the server.
Announce your server, including its public key from bank.asc. You might want
to provide binaries of the client for DOS, either by ftp or by automatic
mail. You might also want to write a better makefile for the Unix version.
Now you need to mint and distribute some, but not too much, money for people
to play with. Give a few coins to the first x people who send a message to your system. Later you can have lotteries, post puzzles and simple ciphers for people to break, etc. to put more money into circulation. But keep your
money scarce. People should be able to get a few coins to play with, but
they should always want more than they have. Good luck!

@_author: needed to compile it 
@_subject: Setting up a Magic Money server 
Magic Money seems to have reached a usable state. (Open mouth, insert foot,
bite down firmly :-) ) Someone needs to set up the first server. Here's how:
You can set up a Magic Money server on any machine with a net connection.
You need to be able to run a program when mail comes in. You do not need
root access. Running a Magic Money server is no harder than running a
cypherpunks remailer. Unlike a remailer, there is no possibility of your
server being used to harass or mailbomb anyone.
Get Magic Money and PGP Tools (needed to compile it) from csn.org. Get pgptl10c.zip and mgmny10e.zip. If mgmny10e.zip isn't up yet, get mgmny10d.zip and fix the bug in mms_mint() by moving the free(fp); to the end of the function. This is the only change in version e. This version has been reported to work on both big and little endian machines. If your machine has assembly-language speedups, get them from the pgp23a
source code. Use the same defines PGP uses to compile on your machine,
and take out the NO_ASM define in my makefile. This will speed up your
server quite a bit.
Compile the client and the server. Define UPTON or one of the other modmult functions, because I have had problems with Smith's modmult. The hash file
is currently set to about half a meg. It grows if it fills up. If you need
to use less disk space, change the settings in mm.h.
Put the server program "s" in one directory, and the client program "c" in another. Put something random (i.e. unknowable to an attacker) in a file
called rand.dat in each directory. The programs won't work without this. The directories should be otherwise empty. Go to the server directory and run "s i" to initialize the server. It will
ask you for the name of your server, size of your key, name of your coins,
and denominations to use. Powers of 2 make good denominations. For example,
you might use 1,2,4,8... up to 32768. With these 16 coin values, you can
transfer any sum up to 65535 with 16 or fewer coins.
After you have entered all the information, the server generates a PGP key
pair, and an e/d list pair. Your server's ascii-armored public key is saved to bank.asc. You will need to distribute this key to everyone who wants to
use your server.
Copy bank.asc into the directory with the client. In that directory, run
"c -i" to setup the client. The client generates a key, then creates a
message "output.asc" which should be sent to the server. For example, if
"client" and "server" were subdirectories in a common directory, you could
run "s < ../client/output.asc > ../client/reply.asc" from the server's
directory. Now go back to the client directory and run "c reply.asc" to
finish setting up your client. You will be running this sequence a lot if
you play with the system, so write a script.
Your client now knows the name of your coins, and has the elist. This
information is updated automatically when the server discovers the client's
copy is out of date.
Go back to the server directory and run "s m " where x is one of your
higher-value coins. You will have problems if you are using version d and
did not fix the bug as described above. This mints a coin and writes it out
to coins.dat.
Go back to the client directory and run "c ../server/coins.dat". The client
reads the coin, checks it, and asks you for values of new coins to create.
Create several smaller coins. The client keeps prompting you until you have
created coins with a value equalling that of the old coin.
The client creates another "output.asc". Run your script to pass it through
the server, and run "c reply.asc" to process the results. The client now
takes the signed coins from the server and the blinding factors from proto.dat, and unblinds the coins. The result is written to allcoins.dat.
Now run "c -p" to withdraw coins from allcoins.dat. Enter the denominations
to withdraw, and 0 to end. Now you have a coins.dat in the client's
directory, so run "c coins.dat" to process it. It will count up the coins
you withdrew, and prompt you for new coin values again, then produce another
output.asc for the server. You can create a second client in another
directory, and pass coins from one to the other.
Try creating a "msg.txt" file in the server's directory. The client will
then display the contents of the message whenever it processes a reply from
the server. The client waits for a keypress after the message.
Now that you know the server works, set it up so that incoming mail to your
account is passed to the server, and the output from the server is sent back
to the person who sent the mail. If you want to use the same account for
the server and regular mail, have users put a specific word in the subject
line of messages to the server.
Announce your server, including its public key from bank.asc. You might want
to provide binaries of the client for DOS, either by ftp or by automatic

About all this proves is that whitehouse.gov reads their e-mail after

As has been mentioned in another forum, there are Federal laws that
require immediate and vigorous investigation of any threat made on the
life of the president, serious or not.  I am curious as to the
practicability of using this (not personally, mind you) as a "barium
test" of encryption and remailer security.
"Barium" is the old British intelligence term for inserting a dummy
message inside normal "secure" communications channels as a check.  The
content of this message would be so explosive that if the opposition had
compromised the communications system, a certain, observable reaction
would be forthcoming.
To my knowledge, no serious barium testing has been done of either the
remailers or PGP, among other "secure" privacy measures.  The Sacramento
child-molestation case seems to indicate that if PGP was compromised by
law enforcement assets (to FBI level in that particular case) this fact
would not be revealed for a purpose as politically-insignificant as
breaking up a child molestation ring.

You realize, of course, that by posting the manual verbatim you have allowed them to discover where the leak was.  They have the ability to change the wording slightly on every document, so that when you quote the document they can discover who gave it to you.  That is why newspapers no longer report quotes from documents that they have, or never show pictures of secret documents.

@_subject: Code review is requested. 
Cypherpunks review code!
I have written a hack to allow pgp's random.h and random.c to be used
with a hardware random number generator. I have mailed this to a
number of U.S. cypherpunks with the request that the hack be
distributed widely in the U.S.
jim.wenzel (Jim Wenzel) has chosen to post this
hack on alt.security.pgp and it is consequently widely available.  The
post was titled "Questionable PGP Patch 01".
jim.wenzel (Jim Wenzel) has suggested the
possibility that my hack may contain a deliberate bug. I Quote:
I would like to note that this hack can only be used by those that
actually have a hardware RNG. But the code is "IFDEF"ed so that it
does not actually enable RNG support unless it is requested to do so
by "DEFINE"s.
I would like to assure everyone that I did not place any deliberate
bugs in my hack. However, jim.wenzel (Jim
Wenzel)'s point is well taken. I may sure that I did not place any
deliberate bugs in the hack, but you can not be without careful code
review.  Also, there is the possibility of bugs caused by programmer
To address these problems, I would like to request that code oriented
Cypherpunks perform a code review of the hack. I have only tested the
hack under OS/2 and the MS-DOS program loader.
I have already noted the following possibilities for improvement:
1) The versions of the hack that use an operating system IO driver
(RANDDRIVER) test that the driver was successfully opened. However if
the hack is compiled to directly access a bus hardware RNG thru its IO
port (HARDRANDOM) the hack does not do any test to assure that the RNG
is actually there. I believe that if you attempt to read a port that
is not supported by hardware you always get -1, which is not very
random. Thus there is the problem that some one could attempt to use a
version of pgp that was originally compiled for a machine with a RNG
on a machine without a RNG. If they did this they could inadvertently
created very breakable ciphers! Perhaps some enterprising cypherpunk
could add code to do minimal randomness checks on the RNG when it is
first used, to test that the RNG is actually there.

sells a RNG that attaches directly to a serial port. Perhaps such a
RNG could be used in connection with my hack using the (RANDDRIVER)
option and the operating system's interface to the serial
port. However I have provided no options for setting the baudrate,
flow control options and other parameters that should be set when
opening a connection to a serial port. I do not know the proper values
for these parameters and I do not have a device to test with. Perhaps
some cypherpunk will volunteer to write such code. It should be
"IFDEF"ed. Also FOSSIL support for the PC world springs to mind. Such
code is always highly operating system dependent. Different code could
be written for each operating system supported by PGP for a hardware
RNG connected to a serial port.
3) There may be other RNG's in existence which are accessed in a
different way, or have different IO drivers. If you have knowledge of
such RNG's please post the info to the cypherpunks mailing list.
In summary, I would like to request that code oriented cypherpunks do
a code review of my hack to support hardware RNG's using random.h and
random.c. Results may be posted on the cypherpunks mailing list.
Since the hack has been posted to alt.security.pgp, the hack is
available globally. Someone outside the U.S. should uudecode the hack
and place it on some FTP site somewhere where it can be publicly
After the code has been reviewed and corrected if necessary, it could
be included in the next source code release of PGP.

This is simply idiotic, worse than Hollander's childish admonition not

Would this be adequate for such a device, or would special

Security Plan Draws Fire
by Edward J. Boyer
Safety: Public housing residents pan the proposal for metal detectors
and gun searches at L.A. projects.
    President ClintonUs call for tougher security in public housing
projects, including metal detectors and random searches, was generally
rejected Monday by residents at the Nickerson Gardens project in
    "We should not have any more sets of rules than the public at large
just because we live in public housing," said Nora King, a past
president of the project's Residents Advisory Council.
    Clinton made his call Saturday in an effort to rid gang-infested
housing projects of guns after a federal judge in Chicago blocked
authorities from conducting sweeps for weapons.  The judge ruled that
the sweeps violated constitutional protections against unreasonable
searches and seizures.
    Public housing residents in Chicago requested the sweeps because
they are "nearly desperate with conditions as they are," said Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros.
    But Los Angeles is not Chicago with its high-rise public housing,
residents at Nickerson Gardens said.
    "People get robbed and raped in those elevators," King said.  "From
what I've seen, Los Angeles has it far better than people in Chicago."
    Metal detectors might make sense in Chicago, but there are no
elevators and no common entry areas in the 1,066-unit Nickerson
Gardens, the city's largest public housing project, residents said.
    "Where would they put metal detectors here?" asked Larry Moore, 25,
who has lived in the projects all his life.  "At everyone's front
    Along with suggesting metal detectors, Cisneros said housing
officials can retake their projects from gangs and drug dealers by
erecting fences around the complexes, by conducting weapons searches in
common areas such as on the grounds and in stairwells, and by urging
tenants to sign consent forms permitting police searches.
    The get-tough policies "are targeted to Chicago, but the same
approach will be available to other communities," Cisneros said
    A Chicago police officer visiting Locke High School in Watts on
Monday as part of an anti-gang rap music show said he is opposed to
weapons sweeps at housing projects in his city.
    "Why sweep the buildings, when we should be sweeping the public
schools, the entire neighborhoods," said Officer Eric Davis, 32, who is
touring several cities with two other Chicago officers. The trio's rap
group is called the Slick Boys.
    "We can chase guns out for one week," said Davis, who patrols
Chicago's Cabrini Green public housing project.  "But what about when
the searches stop?  We want to figure out how to give people self-
esteem--give them a future."
    Weapons searches at Nickerson Gardens are not necessary, said
Delaina Carr, a 15-year resident, "because people have a right to
privacy."  Security guards at night would be more helpful, she said.
    A RAND study released last year showed that the crime rate in Los
Angeles public housing projects was three times as high as the citywide
average from 1986 to 1989.  But by the time the study was released, a
reduction in violent incidents had begun, housing officials said.
    Gang violence, drugs and burglaries are still a concern, Carr said,
but "it is quieter here since the gang truce a year and a half ago. You still hear gunshots, but you don't feel like a prisoner in your own
    Fences, as suggested by Cisneros, might help control some crimes--
especially those committed by people who do not live in the project,
Carr said.
    "They would improve security," she said.  "People couldn't run from
police who could catch them easier before they could climb a fence."
    King said a survey of residents several years ago showed that the
majority were opposed to fencing in the project's 68.8 acres.  But that
attitude seemed to soften later, she said, and some residents now would
support an architecturally attractive fence.
    Moore gave a qualified endorsement to weapons searches, saying:
They could be cool.  But they could lead to a lot of harassment."
    He said he is skeptical about any proposal to search people who
look suspicious.  "I've seen criminals in three-piece suits," he said.
    For one woman standing in her doorway, allowing searches is a moot
    "They do it now, anyway, don't they?" she asked.
    One man who has lived at Nickerson Gardens for 31 years said he
would support bringing in more police, but only if the new officers
"know what's going on here."
    "Train some of the residents to be police," said the man, who asked
to remain anonymous.  "We don't need police who've been watching too
much television news."
    King supports hiring people who live in the community, and she is
convinced that such officers would respond more quickly to calls.
    "It takes hours for the Housing Authority police to respond--if
they come at all," she said.  "If you're not white, you don't get that
quick response."

In the days when telcos used the SXS switching system, there was
significant cost in tracing a call - each channel had to be physically
seized and held - but now it's just a matter of pulling a tape or
punching up the info on a console.  Nevertheless, there are legal
obligations of confidentiality.  Interestingly, the police generally
have no problem seizing toll information on a subscriber, once the
warrant is obtained, because the subscriber needn't be informed - only
the telco, which has a vested interest in keeping the subscriber unaware
that his considentiality was violated.

I thought it was Most major economies are using fiat money today, so it is clear that fiat money will work. But you could not create a new economy with fiat money. The money has to start out having real-world value and convertibility. After it has been in circulation for a while, it can be "decoupled" from outside standards.
There are three problems involved.
1> Getting people started. From clueless to having a working Magic Money client on their system.
2> Distributing your digital coins.
3> Exchanging your digital coins for something of value.
One at a time.
1> Getting people started. The software has to be readily available. The Magic Money server should be able to mail a uuencoded copy of a DOS binary or the source code to anyone who requests it. The binary needs to be compiled with the new pgptupd.zip file. This has a fifo.c dated in April, which fixes a bug in the old fifo.c. I have asked MPJ to integrate this with the pgptl10d on his site. In any case, look for a fifo.c with a date in April. Someone with better Unix skills than me needs to write a proper, system-independent makefile for the Magic Money package and include it with the source code release. Magic Money is not really that hard to use once you get it installed.
2> Distributing your digital coins. The properties you want here are: it should be easy for any newbie to get a few coins to play with, but it should be hard to manipulate this system to stockpile a lot of coins without effort. One way to do this is with a for-pay MUD. Digital coins would be distributed for successful play in the MUD. The free "guest" account would allow anyone to play for a short time (15-30 minutes or so) and get a few coins. The specific actions required would change every time, so someone could not write a program to repeat the same actions over and over to stockpile coins. To get into the deeper levels of the MUD and win more coins, you would have to pay for access.
There could be other ways to get coins too. All should be fun or interesting in themselves, but not too easy. For example, hunts through the Usenet. Post a puzzle with some encrypted coins. The solution to the puzzle is the passphrase to decrypt the coins. Post innocuous-sounding messages to various Usenet groups. Each one has a clue to the puzzle, and pointers to further clues. The first one to solve the puzzle and exchange the coins wins them.
And how about a digital bookmaking operation, and a simulated stock market? Take real stock prices, and allow users to buy and sell with digital cash. You should also have margin accounts (what was that about developing digicash credit and debt?) with automatic margin-call and sellout if you lose, and short-sale capability. Take bets on sporting events, elections, anything which can be publicly verified.
3> Exchanging your digital coins for something of value. This is the easy part: give away prizes in exchange for digital coins. The prizes paid for, of course, by the profits from the MUD. The best prizes are probably consumer electronics ranging from small stuff like Walkmans to major items (if the system is successful) like TV's and computers.
This is really no different from arcades where you put in quarters to play bowling games, and then use the tickets to get prizes if you are good. Or games at fairs. It's not gambling, so it should be legal.
This approach could give your digicash value. Some people will play the MUD for the fun of it (make it a good MUD) and will start to collect coins. People will want to win the prizes, either by playing your contests, or wheeling and dealing with other people. Eventually, when your system is seen as trustworthy, your coins will take on a value of their own. Some people will exchange them for prizes, but many more will just use them as money on the net.
One advantage of this from the operator's point of view is that the risk starts out small and rises with success. When only a few people are involved and the prizes are Walkmans, the risk is low. When the MUD is making good money and everyone is spending your coins, and you are giving away TV's and computers, the risk is higher but so is the payoff. When you are successful, you can profit by minting and spending your coins. Here you have to be careful to put money into the system only as fast as the digicash economy is growing.
Your server needs to be online, and quickly accessible. It can be run through a remailer, since the bandwidth would not be too high. Use a 512 bit key, just in case it becomes popular. And if you are going to publish the address of the server, you will need a firewall between the net and the machine with the secret key.

"The Federalist Papers were anonymous posts."  -- Anon.
I'm so angry I can barely enter this...
This question of anon posts is currently the subject of conflict in
numerous RTKBA net-venues, and I am sorry to see it come up here.  As
someone who has carefully followed the encryption/net-privacy/anonymity
movement for the past three years, I feel that I am qualified to comment
on the issue.
To get to the point, _there are no logical arguments against anon posts_.
ALL the arguments against them I have heard boil down to one of two roots:
        <1>  Technical ignorance.
        <2>  An adolescent prejudice that anon posting isn't macho.
That's _it_.  I can't dignify them further.
To elaborate:
"Real" Names and accounts aren't.  Fictitious and virtually untraceable
"real" accounts and net identities are trivially generated, particularly
with the increasing number of other commercial nets and computer
Bulletin Board Systems linked to Internet.  Anyone can produce a "good"
account in about as much time as it took me to write this.  If anyone is
bent on making trouble on this or any other group, there is no practical
barrier to their efforts, least of all by the banning of remailed posts.
Generating new "real" accounts is often easier than using remailers.  At
least a message from a remailer _says_ it's an anonymous post, and the
reader may killfile that From: field if he has an anti-anon bias.
"Accountability" is generally illusory anyway, as anyone knows who has
tried to silence the many legendary Net Nuisances who have abused
Internet to an extent beyond that which we are likely to encounter in
rec.guns.  If troublemakers want to post mischief, even under their own
names, there is very little that can be done about it.  If you doubt
this, consider the infamous Prodigy "Vito" case.  They'll be back.
In short, if you think a "real accounts only" policy is any protection
against _anything_, you're just dreaming, plain and simple.
Further, _remailers provide needed non-anonymizing functions for some
users_.  Though the parochial Internet mindset assumes that all users
are on complex institutional Unix systems, this is simply no longer
true; many users are on private home computers, linked through a wide
variety of host systems, each with its own limitations.
For example:  In posting this message, I am limited by the
(non-configurable) host software to headers containing only To:, From:
and Subject: fields.  It is impossible for me to Cc: a netmail reply to
a post's author, or include Reference:, Comment:, Reply-To: or any other
header field.  This is frustrating, but by using some remailers for my
reply, I may include these and other standard header fields for enhanced
function.  I do not use the remailer to anonymize, but merely to post
more efficiently - I will include a Reply-To: field with my name in it
as well as my sig.  Currently, such posts are rejected from rec.guns.
There are many other secondary functions for remailers.  Use your own
<"Duhhhh...but I betcha _John Wayne_ wouldn't use a remailer!">
A competent explanation of "anonymized digital reputation" as concept is
beyond the purview of rec.guns, but I will refer those interested in it
to the cypherpunks mailing list.  Put on your thinking cap,
though, as the list principals are smart boys who'll leave you in the
dust if you can't keep up.  Anyone who wishes a better understanding of
the purpose of the anonymity movement should monitor the list for a
But so what?  _Ultimately, all posts stand or fall on their internal
merits, no matter what name - if any - is on them_.  Ego and identity is
utterly irrelevant, or should be.
In these anon-post arguments over the past few years, I have noticed
those who most oppose anon posts are consistently the same persons who
habitually engage in flamewars, ego battles and rants.  This cannot be a
coincidence.  As I have already demonstrated above, remailed posts pose
no "threat" to anything beyond what is already present from falsely
generated "real" accounts, but the urge to personalize and invest ego
(however illusorily) in posts dies hard.  The anonymous post has a long
and noble history; it says, "Here is a thought - consider it on it's
merits, irrespective of how 'important' or obscure its author is."
Further, there are legitimate reasons for wishing anonymity in any case.
There are many persons whose situations are such that participation in
politically-sensitive newsgroups and lists is unwise.  On ca-firearms,
there was an anonymous poster who was a policeman in a highly
politicized, anti-gun PD.  His participation on an activist RTKBA list
would jeopardize his job (remember Leroy Pyle).  Would anyone braying on
here about the un-machoness of anon posting wish to support his family
when he gets fired because of "manly" non-anon policy preferences?  I
thought not...funny how that works.
"Caution is not cowardice and carelessness is not courage."  There is no
upside to being personally conspicuous in dangerous political waters.
If you want to stick your neck out for no good reason, go right ahead,
but don't impose that pointless risk on everyone else just because you
don't know any better.
< MAKE ENEMIES FAST! >
Though the political and civil rights issues at stake in the privacy
movement have probably never seriously crossed the minds of 95% of the
participants here, they exist nonetheless, and are remarkably related
to the RTKBA battle.
_There are no more important natural allies to the RTKBA movement on
Internet than the computer privacy advocates_.  There is substantial
overlap in these groups, and the ill-informed banning of remailer use
in RTKBA net forums is stupidly antagonistic and insulting to the best
friends we have...and right now, we need all the friends we can get,
especially ones who are experienced and organized activists in their own
Such anon codewriters and advocates as Tim May and most other principal
encryption/anti-Clipper/remailer activists are vehemently pro-RTKBA, and
make their support known at every opportunity.  I find it embarrassing
that "well-meaning" but ignorant RTKBA list and newsgroup maintainers
such as "Magnum" and Jeff Chan have directly insulted them so
grievously, without a second's thought or serious consideration.
< "It's _my_ list!  If you don't like it LEAVE!" >
I intend to.
I believe in the RTBKA because I dislike folks who compulsively want to
dominate others by force of authority and who wish to ban everything
they can't understand, or fear because they can't control.
The anti-gunners and the anti-privacy people are the _same_.  Usually,
they are actually the same people (check voting records in Congress),
but in any case exhibit identical mindsets.
When another user left ca-firearms in protest of the
anti-anon policy, imposed there not because of any problems caused by
anon posts but rather "on principle," he received netmail from two
anti-anon users which he forwarded to me when I left the list.  Neither
one had the least idea of the actual issues and technical considerations
enumerated in this message, which was not a surprise.  What I found
truly sickening was that one idiot went on for his entire post about how
a list had to be a "benevolent dictatorship," (oxymoron unnoted) and
that anon posts somehow threatened the "order" of the list, and that
anon posters were ungrateful and soforth.  It was nothing more than a
catalogue of irrational bullyings by a control-addict.
I do not want to align myself with people like that.  Sorry.
If anon posts are forbidden on rec.guns - or ca-firearms, or anywhere
else - I'm leaving and encourage others to do likewise.

Before embarrassing yourself by making such statements, you should
educate yourself about current anon remailer tech.  What you say is only
true for the first-generation trivial remailers such as Penet's, used
for trivial anonymity.
The current chained, encrypted Cypherpunks remailers are, as far as can
be determined, absolutely unbreakable except _possibly_ (and only
theoretically) by a high intensity, highly expensive attack by the NSA
or by an internal physical security breach.  These are complicated and
sophisticated programs.  If you think you can defeat them, there are
lots of folks who would love for you to try.  There is no evidence that
anyone has, and there have been notable cases where Law Enforcement has

 Ch> Please don't waste my time with posts like this.
 Ch> Thanks,
Jeff, listen:  I admired and respected your efforts running ca-firearms,
was grateful for the time you spent on it, and _said_ so,  to you and to
everyone else.  I worked on the Roberti recall, lobbied my legislators
and helped others on the list to do the same.
All that aside, under the advice of the worst possible people*, you made
a policy _mistake_ in ca-firearms policy that has created a tremendous
amount of ill-will and divisiveness and little else.  It didn't make the
list "safe," it didn't promote RTKBA, it didn't do anything
constructive; it only alienated a lot of sincere and able people who
were otherwise on your side, whether you intended to or not.
To my knowledge - and you may correct me if I am wrong - none of the
anti-anon people have addressed a single point in the prevailing
argument for anon posting, which I roughly outlined in my first protest
letter to rec.guns (my subsequent posts there have been censored).
They, and you, have not spent any time in reflecting on the pro-anon
case or apologized for the explicit insult your policy made toward
those who use remailers for legitimate purposes.  If for whatever
obscure reasons you felt a need to exclude remailed posts from
ca-firearms, you could have at least done so tactfully and thoughtfully,
which you did not.
You haven't tried to do any damage control on this or (to my knowledge)
done anything but stonewall the issue.  You handled this ineptly, and
actions have consequences.  In this case, the consequences are the
incurred enmity of other pro-RTKBA, pro-privacy persons and groups.
Worse than that, you have helped convince quite a few people (judging
from my netmail) that there is no material difference between the
irrational anti-gun zealots and the irrational anti-privacy bigots in
the RTKBA forums - an assumption, I might add, completely reinforced by
the anti-anon posts I have seen.  As a consequence, these persons have
dropped out of the RTKBA fight entirely, in disgust.  As one former
ca-firearms participant wrote to me, "I'm not going to choose between
two groups of control addicts."  To that point the guy had been very
active in the faxing and calling of representatives, wrote excellent
letters and was otherwise a real asset to the cause.  Frankly, I'm
beginning to think he's right.
Usenet rec.guns is the _third_ major firearms forum I have seen
disrupted or destroyed by anti-anon policies this year alone.  In the
first case, the best radical RTKBA forum in all cyberspace was
eliminated by anti-gun net administrators employing the selective
application of obscure netlaws, notably a widely ignored "real names
only" rule.  The second was ca-firearms.
I hope the next moderator thinks before he acts.

I have seen no substantive refutation of the points I made in my

The only reason it's a "calm discussion" is that the moderator is
apparently shortstopping most effective pro-anon posts to the list.  He
admits to stopping mine and Cc:ed posts I've received netmail do not

In short, what you see on the group appears to be what he wants you to

I agree with the point, and believe it or not I much prefer to have
things pleasant about me, but when people do ignorant things
like banning remailer use (or guns, or encryption...) without any good
reason and insult the motives and character of those who use them, it's
only reasonable to expect offended parties to yell and cuss.
I mean, think about it:  Would you be polite to Charles Schumer?
 Dp> However, you have made quite an accusation. I did see at least
 Dp> a few posts arguing the pro-anon side (including mine).
Look again and see if you got to see Martin Greifer's post or one from a
guy named Vetleson (sp?).  Greifer's was angry (he was the main objector
to the anti-anon policy on ca-firearms who got me radicalized on the
issue), but made the valid if - damned obvious - charge that nobody
disputed a single point I made supporting remailer use, and Vetleson's
explained _why_ he had to use a remailer to get through to the group for
technical reasons.  I didn't see them in the "digest" the moderator
selectively prepared, nor did I see any of the posts that came via
remailers (naturally).  I didn't see any of the short posts of support,
which may not have been considered "worthy" of inclusion either.  The
incoming headers showed that these had also been posted to rec.guns.
The Vetleson post was entered onto a BBS's rec.guns feed, but didn't
show up on the net.  I didn't save any of these personally (I didn't
think I'd have to), but I'll see if I can retrieve them tomorrow from my
main feed, though this is probably not possible, as it only saves the
last x-number of messages before overwriting.  I think I have Greifer's
netmail address here somewhere left over from the ca-firearms anon wars,
if you want to check with him.  Don't know Vetleson's, but can find out
[here's Greifer's: martin.greifer  Anyway, my
mail ran about 80% pro-anon.
Obviously, he excluded _mine_, and admitted it.
This is exactly what the media does when it wishes to appear "fair" on
an issue - tailor the raw response to support the agenda, with a few
innocuous dissenting remarks to give the illusion of even-handedness.
You'll notice that all anti-anon responses were either butt-kissing
"me-too" posts of moderator adulation, or else completely ignored the
arguments in my post.
 Dp> To put it briefly: "Put up or shut up."
Hey, why don't we apply that idea to these folks who want to ban anon
posts?  If you can raise a _valid_ objection, or can refute my points,
DO IT!...but they _can't_. Anyway, check with Greifer if you doubt this.  If the posts I mentioned
showed up in the digest, post them and I'll apologize, but _I_ sure didn't
see them there.  Did you?  Note that the moderator (funny how he doesn't
use his name much - I've never seen it, and that seems pretty anon to me)
has closed the discussion, so I'm sure that he'll say these posts came in
Frankly, I think he ought to quit the moderator position, as he's unfit.
He provides no protection on the newsgroup from endless boneheaded and
useless newbie posts about illegal modifications of weaponry, but
somehow he finds time to kill 100% legitimate, non-anonymized posts (as
Vetleson asserted in his case, I think) of valid and useful content
_simply because they come through a remailer_.  Obviously, the guy's got
his priorities fucked up and I don't see where's he's doing the group
much good.  I have mixed emotions about the concept of moderated groups
anyway, particularly ones where the "moderation" is so quirkily

Well, look at it this way.  After having several buttheads stamp on your
big toe, you're throbbing sore and about ready to kill the next guy who
does it.  Anti-gun net administrators on another network used obscure
and broadly-ignored rules, particularly a dusty "real names only" policy
to kill off the best gun forum I've ever seen.  Jeff Chan then listened
to a couple of really messed up anti-anon people and unilaterally banned
remailed posts on ca-firearms without valid reasons or
discussion (note from my previous cross-posts that he STILL won't
discuss it to this day).  Now this "Magnum" person, for completely
illogical and uninformed reasons is doing the same goddam thing on
rec.guns, in spite of the fact that I have pointed out the specific
fallacies in the anti-anon argument.  This is like talking to Sarah
Brady about bogus HCI anti-gun claims.  I mean, _deja vu_!

There's _always_ a good reason to exclude something you don't want
anyone to hear.  You show that the Greifer post eventually appeared, but
did it do so AFTER the "Closure on [ANON]" post?  If so, it was likely
retrieved and stuck in AFTER I started raising hell about it.  I got
that post some time ago.  I didn't see the Vetleson post in any case,
and certainly none of the short, supporting pro-anon messages that I got
that were Cc:ed to the group.  If "Magnum" says that his anti-anon
position was overwhelmingly supported (despite the fact it was based on
erroneous propositions) we only have his word for it, as he filters all
messages to the group before we see them.
In the first couple of days after my post, I received twelve netmail
posts (most, perhaps all, showing headers indicating they were also
posted to the group), eight of which supported my pro-anon post, two of
which were illiterate anti-anon blasts of one or two lines, and the
remaining one was upset at the angry tone of the post.  The later mail
was about in the same proportion.  Only _one_ anti-anon post questioned
a single of my assertions, and that was on a technical point about which
the respondent was in error (I will post my response to him after I'm
done with this message).
Is this "overwhelming" anti-anon support?  I think not.  A very heavy
majority who wrote to me supported remailer use, and we are told that
people are more likely to write to bitch than to agree on any given
issue.  Maybe the posts to "Magnum," whoever he is, were completely
anti-anon, but it just doesn't seem plausible to me.  I'm sure at this
point it's too late to know, but it's established that he didn't show us
_every_ message that came in, but merely an edited "digest."
If he's the moderator, he can obviously do whatever he pleases, no
matter if it's the usual capricious and petty nonsense we've all come to
expect from the sort of people who tend to become moderators.  What bugs
me is this charade of consensus...which even if it did exist would be in
favor of a demonstrably flawed policy that should be rejected on the
basis of objective criteria anyway.

some point in an appropriate venue.  I am _really_ distressed at the
intellectual insularity of the RTKBA crowd who are, as a group, probably
the squarest bunch of anal-retentive old ladies I've ever had the
misfortune to be allied with.  Their political unsophistication,
narrowness and conceptual introversion drives me nuts.  They also have
this infuriating timidity about yelling when stepped on.  Note the
collective reaction (and yours) when I did.

"Fair play" is nothing but a quaint irrelevancy in 1994.  Anyone in
serious RTKBA lobbying discovers that in a BIG hurry.  If fair play
mattered, none of these anti-gun bills would have got past committee.
Anyway, there's no way that we can "prove" what the input was at this
late date.  All this mail is ephemeral and gone by now, I'm sure.  If
"Magnum" fiddled the outcome, as I suspect he did to one degree or
another, I don't even really care any more.  The wrongheaded policy is
passed, just like the recent wrongheaded gun laws, and that's _that_.
I see that the moderator (whose comments indicate he _still_ doesn't
understand the mechanics of remailers or the point of their use) has
essentially told Greifer in this belated entry, "My mind is made up,
don't confuse me with facts."
The abusive and plainly stupid no-anon policy has made rec.guns lots of
new enemies and accomplished nothing else of substance.  I've dropped
rec.guns as a waste of my time and an insult to common sense.  If
anything useful at all has come out of this, it's that more and more
people are getting fed up with the insularity, intellectual dishonesty
and hidebound mindset prevailing in these traditional gun forums.
Alternative venues are sorely needed.

@_subject: Automatic Magic Money Client 
We now have three operating Magic Money servers. Several people are
attempting to give value to the digicash. Many applications of digicash
will be entirely net-based and automated. We need an automatic Magic
Money client.
The existing client is designed to interact with a user. The automatic
client will be designed to interact with a program. It will be controlled
entirely by command-line arguments, and should be easy to control from
a PERL script or C program.
I should have some time for coding soon. Here's a rough functional spec
for the automatic client. Don't write any code based on this, becuase it
isn't written yet. But please tell me what you think of it and what should
be changed or improved.
ac -[options] [inputfile] [outputfile]
- -b : display bank's keyid : prints 64-bit keyid of the bank in bank.asc
- -d (with no inputfile) : list the available coin denominations by reading
                         the elist.dat file
- -i (with outputfile)   : initializes client, accepting key length and key
                         name from stdin. Generates initialization message.
- -l (with no inputfile) : lists all coins in the client's coin file                          (allcoins.dat) output will be one coin per line
- -l (with inputfile) : print the total value of a coins.dat type file
                      if it is readable and signed correctly
                      output is one line (number)
- -p (with input/output files) : process a coins.dat type file, preparing it
              for exchange with a server. Reads from stdin a list of coin               denominations to create. Writes to stdout a 128-bit unique
              identifier generated by xoring the coin id's of all the new
              coins created
- -r (with outputfile) : reinitialize. Generate a new initialization packet.
                       Does not regenerate key or prompt for anything.
- -s (with input file) : process a response from the server and store the
                       coins in allcoins.dat. Outputs to stdout the same
                       128-bit unique identifier as the -p generated,
                       followed on the next line by the total value of the
                       received coins, followed by any message from the
                       server.
- -w (with outputfile) : withdraws coins for payment. Accepts a list of coin
                       values to withdraw from stdin, and saves the
                       coins.dat file to outputfile.
- -x (with no output file) : if old coins exist, returns the total value
- -x (with output file) : accepts a list of new coin denominations to create.
                        Exchanges old coins for those values. Generates
                        value and identifier just like -p
To use the client, the payer would run -l to get a list of coins. Then run
- -w to withdraw the coins to a file, and mail them to the shop. The shop
runs -l to determine the value. Then the shop decides what coins to
generate, runs -p to process the coins, and records the unique identifier.
The shop mails the output message off to the server. When the server's
response comes back, the shop runs -s and receives the 128-bit value again.
- From the identifier, the shop determines which transaction was just
completed by the server, and delivers the goods to that customer.
Any ideas for changes/improvements? The biggest mistake I made in
designing Magic Money was to leave out a field for the keyid of the bank
which generated the coins. The only way to process coins from multiple
banks is to try each bank's key in turn, keeping the files for each bank in a different directory, or to have the user specify which bank the coins
came from. I should write a Magic Money 2.0 which handles multiple
currencies automatically. I'll do that if Magic Money coins take on enough
value to make it worthwhile.

piqued by the practice of killing _all_ traffic coming from remailers,
even when the posts were NOT anonymous.  I (and several other users who
have written to me about this issue) would frequently send perfectly
legitimate technical posts through remailers, with Reply-To: fields and

posting reliability.  These messages were all snuffed, simply because
they came through a remailer.  That's pure BS.
Secondly, a lot of folks do not feel easy about posting to ANY
gun-related list or group because of employer, social or other prejudice
to which they may be subjected.  If a joe.victim
wants to use a simple remailer for putting a little shade on his
participation, I don't feel it's anyone else's business; "caution is not
cowardice and carelessness is not courage."  More importantly, it's
nobody else's _problem_ as long as the content of the post is not

I'm amazed that you are being paid good money for supposedly knowing
about these things and do not know that the current generation remailers
incorporate several different schemes for making traffic analysis
virtually impossible at the remailer.  The only thing that can be
determined with any certainty is that an account sends or receives
encrypted messages from a remailer.  This isn't much to go on,
especially considering that the messages are frequently dummies, may
abort or split, do not correspond in size before and after entering the
remailer and are remailed in random order at random times.  Additional
precautions against traffic analysis may be implemented at the
originating and receiving accounts, by generation of artificial volume
or by chaining.
 Sy> I don't contend that it would necessarily be easy, but it can be done.
It's my opinion that no one short of the NSA can do it, but they are
estopped by charter from most of such activities (not that this
matters), could not do it economically or routinely and presumably have
more important fish to fry in any case.
It has been established by barium tests that the top level encryption
and remailer tech is immune from law enforcement from the FBI down,
barring physical security breach, tempest attack or user error.
All of which is beside the point, namely that most users need only
trivial anonymity adequate to protect their participation from being
known to nosey employers, administrators and soforth.  As I pointed out,
remailers in a non-anonymous mode are useful for many people.
 Sy> I agree.  In spite of your email address, it is obvious that you have

You'd be surprised.  Really.  In any case I would personally use other

I didn't say that, nor mean it.  All I said was that there isn't a
_problem_ unless it's in the content, just as with any other message in
a newsgroup.  The fact that a remailer is used in itself doesn't create
a problem in its posting of an otherwise benign message.  See?
 Jo> Wouldn't
 Jo> that mean the moderator has to make more subjective judgements?
I don't know, but if he was killing messages, he'd at least have to have
a reason.  Someone's address isn't one.  The moderator in question here
(rec.guns) subjectively censors my messages because of content, if
that's your point.

Well, I for one already am.  Rejection of otherwise benign technical

subjective and arbitrary a rejection criterion as I can personally
imagine, especially in view of all the absolutely junk posts that do

Once and for all - my points; refute them or shut up:
1:  "Real" accounts are easily simulated/spoofed.  Therefore, a "real
accounts only" policy gives no protection whatever from whatever it is
that the moderator and rec.guns regulars feared so much from remailed
2:  Remailed posts are not always anonymous.  Some users (myself
included) use remailers non-anonymously because our normal systems do
not have as much flexibility, particularly with headers [Cc:, Bcc:,
Reference:, etc] as some remailers provide.  This is especially true for
users of BBS systems and other store-and-forward arrangements.  Such
posts, even with sigs, CLEARSIGN, and Reply-To: fields were being killed
when sent to rec.guns, simply because they came through remailers.  This
was unreasonable.  Jacob Vetleson in particular claimed to have posted
many, many tech posts and articles that were killed because they went
through a remailer.
3:  Some participants on gun forums are uncomfortable using their
regular accounts, especially when posting from their business sites,
because of employer prejudice against firearms, and desire some degree
of anonymity - even the trivial anonymity provided by the simple,
unencrypted remailers - to protect their jobs.  I also know a _lot_ of
single women who do not like to post on _any_ newsgroup because they
fear harassment at their jobsites stemming from some weirdo tracking
them from their mail address.  There are plenty of other reasons to use
anonymous remailers.  You may think they're stupid, I may think they're
stupid, but that's none of our business.  The measures one takes for his
own defense and privacy are his own affair and his own responsibility,
whether this means getting a house gun or using a remailer for his
messaging.  It's not for me or you to judge.
4:  Someone (was it you?) smugly said that remailers were no good
anyway, because of other measures available for defeating them,
specifically traffic analysis.  I posted a message explaining at some
length the exhaustive countermeasures some of the more sophisticated
remailers (and remailer users) incorporate to defeat traffic analysis.
I didn't hear another peep about _that_ subject.
5:  The remailers are the brainchildren of extremely pro-RTKBA net
activists.  Ignorantly banning remailer use was pointlessly antagonistic
toward several very powerful, active and well-financed allies.
6:  Numerous people simply hated remailed posts "on principle."  My
answer to that was basically, "So what?"  I hated all the inane newbie
crap that got posed on rec.guns asking the same _stupid_ questions ten
or twelve times a week, usually how best to violate 922(r) or render an
otherwise good weapon worthless through brainless modifications, etc..
etc., etc.  You know what I do when I see posts I don't like or that
offend my sensibilities?  I scroll through them.  I killfile the author.
I don't bother to read them.  These are perfect solutions for those who
have irrational aversions to anon posts.  Look into them.
 Ro> Answer this: Does every newsreader have a killfile option?
Every setup I have used (six or seven, I think) has _some_ provision for
twitting, filtering or killfiling.  If yours doesn't, you might want to
look into a change, especially if other peoples' posts bother you so
much.  Having whole classes of posts censored from a newsgroup seems an
awfully inefficient way of setting up a twitfile...but that's exactly
what you are, in essence, advocating.

I would love to see examples of this.  "Macho" McDaniel seems to have a

He presumably wants us all to wear red uniforms and advance in ranks in

Yes, this is the whole point.  If someone wants to hoax a newsgroup,
he can _easily_ fabricate an "good" ID in the time it has taken me to
write this message so far.  If McDaniel is so phobic about remailered
posts, _why doesn't he scroll past them and shut the fuck up?_  Anon
posts _say_ they're anon and are posted on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.
Obviously McDaniel is too neurotic to do either and wishes us to share
his personal problem.
His argument about anon "net pollution" is also absurd, considering the
staggering differential level of "pollution" generated by other perennial
net-banes such as gross over-quoting and irrelevant cross-posting.  This
reminds me of the stingingly accurate net adage...
        "Sig files are annoying, juvenile, stupid and a waste of
        bandwidth.  Of course, so are 90% of the posts on Usenet."
McDaniel can save his tantrums and stick to moderated newsgroups
populated by like minded netnazis.

"Crack-downs"...  I'm really getting tired of this mindset.  No doubt
McDaniel is salivating profusely waiting for Gore's Federally controlled
"Information Superhighway" with all e-mail identified and tracable by
use of Clinton's National ID "SmartCard" (don't laugh - this was a
specific, stated purpose of the project).

Having seen McDaniel's flames of anon users in other forums, I _really_
doubt the sincerity of this statement.

Ok, I won't send that file anymore.
Well not exactly, because of a bug in pgp, the +legal_kludge=off
does not work by itself. What does work is
+CERT_DEPTH=0 +LEGAL_KLUDGE=OFF +CERT_DEPTH=4
Where 4 is the value that you actually want for CERT_DEPTH.
I did not want my program to change the behavior of pgp with
respect to CERT_DEPTH. So I had my program scan config.txt to
find the value there. It then sets the final value of CERT_DEPTH
to be the value found there. If no value can be found for CERT_DEPTH
then it uses pgp's hardcoded default which is 4.
Which shell language? I understand that unix has several although I am
not a UNIX expert.
I wanted to have a program that could be drop in replaceable in
a dos environment. I wanted it to be possible to have existing pgp
shells continue to work with the SEPT 1 kludge disabled.
In DOS, there are common library  calls that only spawn
executables (.exe files) and do not spawn .bat files. The same is
true of OS/2. If any of the commonly avaiable pgp shells used these
calls, I wanted my program to be an executable so that it would
work as a replacement which would disabled the kludge.
I do not see how one could write a dos .bat file that could
scan config.txt for the users choice of CERT_DEPTH. If you could
do it, it would be sure to be slow. Some Dos users do not use
microsoft's command.com, so it is hard to see how a .bat file
could be fully portable in DOS.
In short, I think my program could be useful to some people
who must send messages to people with old versions of pgp.
I wish that someone would make it available at an ftp site.
I won't send it out anymore and I am sorry I bothered you.
