I add my congratulations to everyone else's.  But, as the list rejoices that this means the "end of ITAR" or, more accurately put the "end of encryption programs as 'munitions'", I've got to play the devil's advocate.
Many of you, of course, see me as the Devil's Advocate.  Anyway, certain arms of the government want to prevent strong crypto from being exported so that they can easily decode encrypted messages from abroad (at least those using US developed software).  Damien's impressive feat is that exportation of weak crypto indeed makes that possible.  Some posters have discussed the time and difficulty in decoding strong crypto ... I think all agree that it would take significantly longer (or much more computer time) but is not impossible.
So ... has this proven that the banning of strong crypto is the correct way to go, and that, at least to some, credit card transactions using weak crypto will be acceptable to most (given the ease of getting CC other ways)?

You must realize that there can be a difference between what agencies say is necessary and what policy ultimately becomes on that issue.

The FBI may say they want X, but the policymakers may take the FBI's arguments (always with a grain, or a bucket, of salt), consider other agencies views, public opinion, the persuasiveness of everyone's reasoning, and *then* adopt a policy that satisfies no one completely.

No question.  Many high profile public corruption, Mafia, and high-level narcotics trafficking cases are made with wiretaps.  In our district, we managed to convict almost 20 people in an investigation of the state legislature, including the now-former Speaker of the House and > 6 other legislators.  Bribing lobbyists took hits, etc.
Particularly effective were the court-approved video and audio tapes of the Speaker taking a bribe in exchange for certain action on legislation and responding to the bribing party:   "Well bless your heart."
That has become the office's mantra.
I understand the same was true of the South Carolina state legislature investigation (wiretaps). A number of previous investigations of our legislature failed over the past 15 years as the stonewall held.  Wiretaps, hidden microphones, and hidden cameras put corrupt politicians (I know - redundant) out of business.
I don't doubt that wiretaps may sometimes be abused despite the incredibly onerous review process, but they have positive aspects, too.

My response was to the wiretap correlation to career-making cases.  I don't believe encryption is widespread enough yet to be a serious problem in the Title III area.  It is a potential problem, though, as encryption (rightfully) spreads.  The question I am debating with myself, with all of your help, is what the policy "ought to be."

The White House also reads publicly available newspapers and magazines (I assume).  How is accessing a Web site different from that?
Is the World Wide Web your idea of "electronic surveillance technology"??  I would agree that packet sniffing is a different problem, but accessing an open Web site seems reasonable to me.  Would you prefer that the staffers use home computers to do this (in an attempt to hide their tracks)?  As far as I know, this was all done openly and the Web site chose, right or wrong, to reveal the contents of their log files to someone.  Again, what about the complaints heard in this forum recently about law enforcement's obtaining similar log files from the Web site set up regarding the child's kidnapping?

Once again, I must disagree.  Several bulletin boards I frequent include an opening banner announcing that, essentially, all messages left there are "public" and can be read by anyone.  I can get the exact language if you like.  The message specifically refers to the wiretapping statute, 18 U.S.C. Section 2510 et seq.  This keeps the sysop, arguably, from suffering civil liability if mail is intercepted.  Nobody reads the banner, but I believe that it has more effect than a fig leaf.

Getting sued and being liable are very different, just as getting charged with a crime and having done something morally wrong can be very different.  I am much less confident than you apparently are that the court system (and products liability law) are likely to impose duties on the makers of browsers such as you suggest.  In an advancing technological area, I don't believe that liability will be imposed so quickly, especially if some disclosure is made.  What disclosure is required is likely to be fact specific on a case by case basis until the law has time to develop some sort of standards.

Probably not, especially once the grand jury's term has expired.  What the non-lawyers must realize, however, is that (in most cases) relatively little of a "grand jury investigation" is conducted before the grand jury.  It varies from case to case, and prosecutor to prosecutor, but gathering records using grand jury subpoenas (and reporting to the GJ that the records have been obtained), interviewing witnesses outside the GJ (and eventually summarizing the information when presenting a proposed indictment for consideration), is much more common.
There are various reasons for this:  minimize the inconvenience to the members of the grand jury (if they had to hear every witness, productive or otherwise ...), limited available grand jury time, unnecessary creation of Jencks Act material (testimony of trial witnesses which must be turned over to the defense), and simple lack of time.  Know that agents cannot be present in the GJ except when they are testifying (and only one witness is allowed at a time).
I, for example, have about 40 investigations going on for which I bear at least some responsibility.  Most are conducted by the agents until they present the case to me for a final decision on whether to present a proposed indictment.
Certain cases, of course, I am more involved in, and I would guess that the Mitnick investigation was one.  But being more involved almost certainly doesn't mean bringing *every* witness to testify before the GJ.  So even if a grand juror told you everything that went on in a particular case, you would not know everything the investigators/prosecutors know.

Agreed.  A petit jury is when citizens have the right and power to do what they will.  Juries are supposed to judge the facts and, if they don't believe a fact necessary for one side to win, then the other side wins.
But that's not the end of it:  Lawyers play on jurors' sympathies all the time -- spouse and kids in the front row (crying), "mentioning" a defendant's extensive medical problems, etc.  The jury can accept these or not.  Occasionally, a jury will buy into some of that and the judge will be so disgusted at what *he* sees as an injustice, that he will lecture the jury before dismissing them.
Yes, jurors swear an oath to follow the law as the judge gives it to them, but jury nullification is well-established in Anglo-American jurisprudence.  One of my local federal district judges seriously considered instructing the jury on its "right to nullify" at the close of the case.  Obviously, he didn't care for that particular prosecution.  It wasn't my case, so I don't know if he ultimately instructed the jury on nullification, but I know the prosecutor was running around the library, looking for ammo to use in his argument against the instruction.
And yes, in an appropriate case, I can see myself asking the judge for such an instruction -- and I see myself, in effect, arguing it in closing in many more cases.

You need to know who is on your jury.  Many goverment employees, retirees, and housewives (who frequently populate juries) are at least as likely to not care what the cops did while looking at, say, a young black male defendant charged with distributing drugs.
Not Guilty *never* means innocent.  It means not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (or "we nullified"). Especially because $$$ is available to hire jury experts, do a summary mock jury trial to test theories out, and have a shadow jury.
My personal record in a federal criminal case is four hours -- from jury selection to verdict.  The defendant later threatened to kill his lawyer, the probation officer, the judge and ... me.
Roger that.
The first case I ever tried, I lost.  I was very unhappy.  But the victim was quite pleased.  She felt that she had the opportunity to say what she had to say ... let it all out ... and everything was fine.  There is some value in "reverse allocution."

Yes, he does, I think.  But I think "protected" above should read "prohibited."  [Note to Greg: could that be a typo?]  The key kiddie porn/1st amendment case (whose name escapes me for the moment) offered two reasons why kiddie porn could be regulated in the face of the first amendment.  One reason was the "on-going trauma to the child [victim]."In a morphed image, they is not (or at least may not be) an actual child victim.  Thus the "continuing trauma" rationale for regulation does not exist in that case. Different standards frequently apply to adults and children, in spite of those of you who like to arm your toddlers!  :-)
Adults, for the most part, are supposed to take care of themselves.

The law specifically criminalizing threats against the President (and other specified persons) gives federal authorities jurisdiction to investigate the cases, which frequently have interstate connections.  It is relatively difficult for a state to investigate and prosecute an interstate case.

It is an admission against interest and a confession; it is admissible against the speaker in a prosecution against him for "exporting crypto"
from a strictly evidentiary standpoint.
Your understanding of evidence is inaccurate.  The evidence re the laptop[s] would be admissible and the parties would argue about what it meant.  The jury is entitled to draw common sense inferences.  That might be easy to do in a case in which a defendant has confessed....
So now you, as your own lawyer (apparently) have decided to take the stand and testify.  Remember that the prosecutor gets to cross-examine you.  Things are about to get ugly.... Circumstantial evidence is admissible if probative of a fact at issue in the case.  Evidence that you took a laptop out of the country is probative of the allegation that you exported crypto using a laptop.
And your understanding of evidence shows a misunderstanding of how the rules of evidence actually work in a courtroom. You are absolutely wrong.  It may not be enough for a conviction, but it will beat a Rule 29 motion (Motion for a judgment of acquittal) and get the case to the jury.
Must a jury believe that you were "just bragging" because you now, in a criminal trial, say that you were? Perry Mason is only active in re-runs.
That's where prosecutorial discretion comes in and a judge's and jury's common sense comes in if the prosecutor runs amok.
BTW, I am far more willing to believe you were bragging about whacking Jimmy Hoffa than about exporting crypto.  Think of all the interesting evidence from this mailing list's archives that prosecutors would attempt to introduce against you ...

John's action wasjustified in my view, although I believe courtesy should have caused him to notify Vulis that he was out ... and for all the heat he has taken, John should've prevented him from posting to the list.
Regardless of what good he may have done in the past, Vulis was (and is) engaged in an enormously egotistical disply of bad manners and off-topic posting.  Having just installed Eudora Pro 3.0, I know that I can easily filter him out, but have hesitated to use filters in the past.  Vulis may be the one to push me over the edge.
I'm especially sorry that some of you don't believe in property rights.  Some have argued that the list is now a public forum -- apparently primarily because a lot of people are listmembers.  This confiscation of private property would, I thought, be inimical to the cypherpunks general philosophy (to the extent one exists).  I'm sure Louis Freeh will be pleased to know that you believe in such confiscation.  With email being used by so many people and because it traverses some publicly owned sites, you certainly cannot argue that it is not a public forum -- if cypherpunks is.  So GAK should be OK, because it is simply an attempt to broaden the audience for speech, right?  And, in any event, the government could choose to ignore property rights and confiscate the speech, as you seek to do with John's privately owned list.

Be especially carefully of structuring a $10,000+ transaction into smaller transactions in an attempt to circumvent the reporting requirements.  Doing so ("structuring a transaction") is a felony.
I was involved in reviewing a matter for possible prosecution in my former life.  Guy wins big football pool (season long) -- total of $27,000.  He calls an *leaves a message* that he wants 3 $9,000 checks.  He gets them, goes to branch 1 of bank x and cashes one.  Then to branch 2 and cashes another.  Then back to branch 1 for the third.
The bank, as required, filed a Report of Suspcious Transaction.  Fortunately for him, the IRS-CID agents jumped the gun and alerted him to the investigation (by interviewing him) before he filed his taxes for that year.  He then knew enough to report the income and pay the taxes.
We settled the matter by having the money forfeited and having a civil monetary penalty assessment against him under the Bank Secrecy Act (the first such penalty against an individual ever).  He got credit on the civil assessment for the money forfeited, so all he lost was his $27,000 in winnings.
Had he been better at it, he never would've been caught, IMNSHO.

Your answer looks pretty good to me (although I must admit I didn't pull the statute once I saw that you replied to Bell's post).  Except that we didn't consider a 5322(b) charge for various reasons.
The reason which we were unhappy with our IRS agents is that structuring is hard to sell to a jury in a vacuum.  If you can explain the reason for the structuring by, for example, adding a tax charge, the structuring charge is much easier to understand as something that is "wrong" within our system of laws.
In other words, he committed the crime but it would have been more difficult to prove BRD at trial than if the IRS hadn't messed up.  The target, who is a lawyer, wanted to resolve the matter without a trial if possible to avoid risking incarceration and loss of his law license.
Remember, Jim, he AGREED to the disposition.  While represented by one of the best criminal defense lawyers in our jurisdiction (since deceased).
Since that case, the Supreme Court has made it more difficult to succeed in such prosecutions by toughening the knowledge requirement.  That would not have help the gambling attorney, because he had previously been involved in transactions where CTRs were filed and knew of the regs.

No.  The person who wrote the checks was a secretary for the guy in California who ran the pool.  While we could've asserted jurisdiction and prosecuted her, we didn't because she had no idea why the winner wanted it done that way (3 $9k checks) and satisfactorily answered the question put to her.  The lawyer lied big time, when initially interviewed, which is in itself a crime.  And most of the members of the relevant section of our office had to recuse themselves, because they play basketball with the guy.

You misunderstand what the statute intends.  The violation is for attempting to evade *the bank's* requirement to report certain transactions (i.e. >$10K).  He structured the transaction in an effort to keep the bank from complying with the law.
So you want the bank to be your nanny?  The guy is a lawyer and had previously been involved in transactions in which such reports had been filed.  What is your explanation for the three 3 $9k check request?

of the transaction, then the transaction was reported IN FACT and the The transactions were reported as suspicious transactions. There could have been a reasonable explanation for them, but there wasn't.  When interviewed by the offending IRS agents, the target's story was ludicrous.  One part consisted of alleging that the first bank didn't have enough $100 bills to cash all three checks.  Whoooooops.  The bank keeps vault records, which I subpoenaed for the day in question. Guess what they showed. No, but he wasn't going to be charged with evading reporting requirements, but rather with structuring a financial transaction *in an attempt* to avoid reporting requirements. Hardly.  Juries are permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the facts before them -- the instructions about how the checks were to be cut, the three bank routine (along with what he said to the tellers at the branch that remember the transaction), and what he told the IRS when they interview him.  In addition to being stupid by going to branches of the same bank on the same day, he was stupid (and arrogant) by not exercising his right to keep his mouth shut when the IRS knocked at his door ... and then by lying to them.

The fact that a bank complied with a federal regulation governing the bank is not similar to a business selling a defective product.
Apparently I do.  And that is that juries can draw inferences and that lawyers can call attention to possible inferences.  His lawyer could argue "no harm, no foul" and the prosecutor could argue that he intended to violate the statute, but got caught.  The jury would've then decided the issue, with the government bearing the burden of proof BRD. And the State of California was free to prosecute him.  Most crimes are state crimes only; some have both state and federal aspects; others are solely federal crimes.
