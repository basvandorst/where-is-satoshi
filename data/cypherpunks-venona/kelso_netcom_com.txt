Looking at the source code showes that all that is needed to
pass the PGP key check is for the first two blocks to decode
in such a way that the last 2 bytes of the IV match the 2
check bytes before the actual message. Thus the first 6 bytes
of the IV and the last 6 bytes of the next block need not
match the actual message.
There was a bug in the older versions of PGP that set the
IV to a constant instead of a random value when encrypting
with the "-c" option.
I made a mistake thinking that knowledge of the correct
key would help in creating a fake key.

If anyone is interested, the "vcr+.shar.gz" file
from "sable.ox.ac.uk" contains
two (2) source files (encode.c and decode.c).
These source files both have the same small errors.

Sounds like a recomendation for SFS (Secure File System).
It encryppts everything going to the disk.
I used an SFS partition for a while.  But, I swap between
DOS and Linux.  Havn't seen SFS for linux yet.

Perhaps Electronic Cash has a sound.
Phone Phreakers have something called a Redbox.
This device makes the sound of a quarter.
When an ATT pay phone asks you to deposit $1.75
you just make the sound of 7 quarters... :)

"cypherWONKS" sounds to me like someone working for Bill Clinton.
I believe that Bill and Hillary are the only people that I have
heard use this WONK term.  Even they didn't like WONKS.

@_subject: Crypto Sync Issue 
I am interested in encrypting a SLIP link between my
PC (running Linux) and my Netcom shell account (running
My question has to do with error conditions on the line.
If I drop a character or packet, the two sides will loose
crypto sync and result in things scrambled from then on.
The modems will fix most of the low level problems.
However, Murphy's Law has not been repealed. :)
Are there any standard methods to provide the SYNC between
the sender(encryption) and the receiver(decryption) on
an Async connection ? Since Slip uses IP packets, I was planning on an encryption
of the data portion of the IP packets (leaving the header
alone). Tom Rollins

One method to take the heat off of the last remailer
in a chain would be to call on our friend the "one
time pad".  A message is split into two equal parts
that only make sense when the two parts are 'xor'ed
together.  The seperate parts are then sent through
different paths to the final recepiant (or newsgroup).
The reader would have to 'xor' the parts together in
order to read the message.  The remailer could not be
blamed (as the message was unreadable to him).
The drawback is that the message would be unreadable
until both pieces showed up.
This method could also be expanded with two more equal
parts that transform the origional two parts into
two different messages unrelated to the origional
