@_subject: REPOST: Amnesia Remailer 
Excuse the repost but I was asked to do this again !MIME :)
The amnesia remailer is now available for public use:
amnesia is a combination mixmaster/type 1 remailer supporting
the following capabilities:
 cpunk mix pgp hash latent cut ek ksub
Encrypted: PGP  - header
		- pasting
Latency:	- header
Cutmarks:	- header
Encrypt-Key:	- header
Due to the nature of my mail connection there is an automatic variable
latency of 0-180 minutes. The reordering pool is set to 5 presently.
amnesia is currently running the following software:
Lance Cottrell's Mixmaster v.2.0.3beta6
Lance Cottrell's Reordering package.
John Fleming's  Freedom Remailer v.1.00 (upgrading to 1.6beta soon)
Hopefully USENET posting capability will be added soon.
The remailer keys are attached.

@_subject: REMINDER - amnesia remailer public key 
This is a reminder that the type1(cypherpunks) remailer at
 has a new public key. Please REMOVE the old
key from your keyrings. Since the corresponding secret key was lost due
to a combination of hardware failure and destroyed backup media, any
messages send using the old key will be lost.
Attached is the new key. If you don't trust this message, send mail to
amnesia with the Subject: remailer-keys will get you
the latest public keys for the remailer.

: : I don't know if anyone else has seen this, but I was mailing letters

: said that all packages 16 ounces or over had to be taken inside for

: though you can abstain from marking a return address, the postal
: inspectors would like a nice photo of you with your mail.
Note that neither the USPS or the Postal inspection service really want
anything to do with this crap. This was mandated by the FAA which
threatened to stop allowing the mails to be carried on domestic
passenger flights.

@_subject: amnesia@chardos.connix.com DOWN 
Effective immediately  is DOWN. I was
requested to terminate remailer service by my ISP, which has received
numerous complaints recently (from people who obviously don't have the
ability to read the headers correctly), and finally had enough. The acquisition of my own domain name should alleviate any future
objections, but this will have to wait till after the 1st of the year :(
For the next 10-15 days I will manually process any mail destined for
nymservers or just passing through to other remailers.
