discussed, if not amongst those who are most involved in its creation and
proliferation?  The political use and misuse of power is central to the
issues regarding encryption, and these ramifications should be discussed as
the technology is in its infancy. Encryption technology can be used as a
tool to empower the individual, or it can be used as a means to lend a
false security to the individual in his communications. If in fact the
Clipper Chip with its easily obtainable (by government agencies) escrow
keys is allowed to be implimented, we may in fact be assisting the
government to effect a survelliance state of a maginitude never before seen
in society. As American homes become host to "interactive" technologies, we
need to realize the increased ability this brings for surveillance by both
government and capitalistic enterprises. Encryption is one viable solution
to re-instate the privacy equlibrium in the face of such a condition- this
is where its power lies. sociological one; to discuss merely the technological and not the social
and moral implications of this techology would be to not realize its full
potential as a mediator to the coming state of "Big Brother is watching
You". Politics, then, is not periferal but central to the discussion of
encryption technology.

Well, now that we've gotten THAT straightened out..  I guess its always helpful to be clear in one's wording, hmm? Hopefully this will be the end of this thread- I'll go back to lurking
again for now. By the way- am reading 1984 again- I
think we should definetly get those NSA shirts out "We're just running a
little late"! Scary!

@_subject: Little known facts about the infohigh.... 
another round of propganda, or another scheme set up by the NSA and other
branches of our government's "protectful" branches  to keep an eye
on "terrorist activities" in the homes of our American citizens. I just
finished reading "1984" to get me in the mood for a paper I am working on
concerning computer surveillance...and now I receive this post regarding
the use of TV technology being used to create the infamous Orwellian
"Telescreen" which can hear and see our every move. Does anyone on this
list have any further information about this? Perhaps (and I am crossing my
fingers here) this was a post- April Fool's Day gag.. trouble is- it seems
just feasible enough to make me worry.
Michael Scrage from MIT entitled "Why Clipper's Unlikely to Chip Away
Privacy?" (14 April 94). I can re-post if necessary. A couple of quotes
from it
"Now, unless the government makes such private encryption illegal (such as
PGP), Clipper is going to foment (sic) entrepreneurial digital
cryptographers feeding off the paranoid fantasies of individuals and
institutions that fear their communications might be compromised by Big
"As long as there is a thriving market in commercial cryptography, CLipper
is unlikely to be a threat to our privacy or our criminals."
Comments Anyone?

- I'm begining to get a bit paranoid! However, I do sometimes wonder if
some of the new technologies (such as "interactive TV") which will be be
brought into the homes of the populus could in fact be used for more
insidious purposes than was the original intent (I am generously assuming
the original intent was as it was presented to the consumer).
I mean- what's to stop the government- or perhaps the big capitalists-
from utilizing the technologies, such as that suggested by the Neilson
people, to monitor citizens *not* part of some voluntary rating program. Are you suggesting that since Denning et al aren't "argueing for it"
that it is inconceivable? Hmm....

And Sandy Sandfort responded:
The thing is- yes of course, one coulpd pay cash to avoid Safeway- and in
fact, perhaps that is one must do. However, it seems to me that we a re
touching on alarger issue here- and that is the fact that these practices
amount to societal surveillance techniques which are being employed with
greater and greater frequency. One has to get a bit nervous, it would seem-
when it becomes easier and easier for the powers that be to track your
every move- including the videos you have rented, the people you have
spoken with or correspaonded with, the books and magazines you have read,
etc. This may not be of concern to the average citizen who is content with
going to work and going home and watching TV every night- but for those who
don't buy into or are actively hostile towards the dominant hegemonic
ideology of this country- surveillance may in fact become a real concern.
Computers make such surviellance, as we have seen, more and more feasible
on a grander scale- both in terms of the amount of information it is
possible to obtian about a person, and in terms of the amount of people
which can easily be watched.
computer technology could potentially inadvertently give great power to a
centralized government. I suppose that is why it is so important not to
merely say "Hey- pay cash"- but rather to think about the further
implications of surveillance via computer in our society.

geez!!	!
Cyberspace" piece- and I read this now about warantless searchs!! I'll tell
you- I think we've got to keep an eye on the government. I love how they go
ahead and supercede the rights of the lower classes- if warrantless
searches were being conducted in Beverly Hills or some other mainly
upper-middle class city- the public outcry would be enormous!
government may want to watch the activities of certain people in our
country via electronic means- however, if the activities of people happen
to go against the current government's ideology, it seems to me more than
possible that they may be watched. This warrantless search thing seems ot
me just one more example that the governemnt can and will do what it
wishes. Um- did I miss soemthing here, or have they also superseded our
right to keep and bear arms? Hmm... gettin a little scary out there.

(Stuart said:)   He has concluded that the members of that community are so beneath
Stuart Baker has made regarding the Net. Not only is it not peopled solely
by "teenage boys with inept social skills"- the National Information
Highway is gearing up to be in every home, school, hospital, etc in
America.  By trying to pin the anti- Clipper campaign against a group of
young renegade computer hackers, Baker is trying to reduce the credibility
of the arguement against Clipper as a serious threat to our rights  by showing
that only a few, marginalized "punk" kids are opposing this issue. The NSA
is launching a smear campaign, obviously, to discredit those in opposition
to its grand scheme of being able to listen to every supposedly private
phone and data transmission in America. By marginalizing the opposition in
this way, the NSA hopes to gain the trust and backing of the mainstream,
who have bought the Image of the Net as some kind of haven for computer
work of our own. By utilizing some of the analogies which the average
person can understand, we can try to combat this serious threat to our
right to privacy. Perhaps we need to make a concerted effort to get more
articles published in mainstream magazines regarding this issue. I am
currently completing a piece on computer surveillance and privacy issues-
perhaps this summer I can put something together for the mainstream media.
I am sure that plenty of you all can write- we should make sure the word
gets out to the masses reagrding the true nature of the Net and regarding
the Clipper isssue in particular, now that we know what tactic the NSA is going to take.

@_subject: Re: Cypherpunks as lobbying/propagandizing group 
anarchistic than to think of yourselves as belonging to an organized "group",
but I am getting concerned about a certain disassociation with the
political aspects of cryptography which I am seeing by some members of this
list- especially the post awhile back which was of the tone of "leave it to
the other guys to lobby and be political, etc" - meaning throwing the
responsibility over to the EFF people, etc. While I am sure that they are
organized to lobby in this sort of way, my original thoughts on rallying
some of us together was not to try to form yet another lobbying
organization, but rather, to perhaps "fight fire with fire" with some of
the media bad press that we are getting as subscribers to this list, and as
regarding the political talk, with requests for more 'tech talk' - It seems
to me that these threads are in a sense mutually exclusive in a certain
sense, and could very easily be carried on at the same time. If you want to
talk tech- just jump in and do so- but people are probably not going to
call on you to start the thread..I just am not sure why someone would
object to *both* tech and politics- and anyway- if you don't like the
political talk, you could always write yourself a filter.
"sitting back and waiting while the 'newbies' talk over things which have
been said before (politically, I take it)- the thing is, the cryptography/
Clipper policy is being designed and debated *now*- I can't see how
whateve you all talked about 3 years ago can really be relevent to what's
going on in the media today regarding this important issue. It seems to me
this isn't a static, circular discusion, but rather a continuous, ongoing thread which is informed by the media on a day to day basis..And  unless
you all are amazingly clairvoyant, it would have been hard to know all the
events which are going on now three years ago.
going to do what I can to object to it. I am not of the mindset to "leave
it to someone else" to do.      Julie

You know.. I wonder with all this bickerig if in fact we CAN agree on the
fact that we all are opposed to invasions of our privacy via governemnt
surveillance techniques.. Can we agree on that issue? It seems to me that I
have heard a consensus on this at least...
am working on regarding computer curveillance, Clipper, etc- and the
professor who read it asked me "What is the likelihood and what re the
reaosns for the NSA and other governments agencies wanting to monitor the
people?" I wasn't sure of exactly how to answer that! I mean- it seems to
me that the governemnt wants to maintain its own power, and keep a watchful
eye on those with opinions oppposite of their own. Any other reasons you
all can think of? Hmm..
