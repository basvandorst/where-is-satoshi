@_subject: NASA 'educating' scientists to restrict free speech. 
Hi, my name is Chris Kuszmaul. I am a contractor at NASA
Ames research center. I feel it would be valuable for the general
scientific community to be aware of some upcoming classes designed to educate scientists here regarding what they may and
may not write on the internet, or any public forum.
  As the text above says, everybody is welcome to attend.
