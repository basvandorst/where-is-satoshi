@_subject: Symantec's claim. 
In light of recent claims,i would like somebody to clear this up for me.
There seems to be a great deal of conjecture over wether or not the Deeyenda Virus exhists.
Symantec denies it's existence,although i hear differently??
Greatly appreciate anyone who can shed some light on the subject,even though C-punks list doesnt usually deal with this topic of thought ;)
Anyone come across the pkz300 trojan,if you have it send it please.
A student,a paper,and a possible future career are at stake here,so please dig deep into your pockets!!!!!! Asking a lot i know!

@_subject: Tell me this,referring to Symantec's claim. 
Okay granted,i am virtually sure Deeyenda does not exhist,but i asked a simple question.
Altavista is a cute idea though ;) Who posted this shit then,someone care to get back to him????
Sounds like a pretty amazing virus to me??? More a crock of shit than anything else,but...
Hey maybe it'll run for president as well....
Sorry to inconvenience anybody,ridicule should have a purpose ;)
