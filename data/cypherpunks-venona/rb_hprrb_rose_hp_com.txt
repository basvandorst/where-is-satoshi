@_subject: A/V compression 
I picked this up off the net a while ago.  Sounds like the CL451 might
be programmable to do encryption/decryption, too.
Background:  MPEG is a compression standard for compressing VHS-quality
video and stereo audio into a 1.5Mbit/s stream.
If anyone's interested in funding/collaborating on a project involving
this, let's talk.

@_subject: Re: backing? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Cognitive dissonance.  Care to explain?
I agree with Perry and Doug on this one--if not gold as backing, then
perhaps virtual-world resources instead, such as information, or storage
space, or CPU time.  But not existing, government-backed currencies, at
least in the long run.

@_subject: Re: Should we oppose the Data Superhighway/NII? 
I, like Tim May, also cancelled my cable-TV subscription a few months ago,
and would have long before that if my kids didn't like the Disney channel
so much.  None the less, the data highway _is_ being built, right now, by
the phone and cable companies, and digital video-on-demand and videophone
capabilities seem to be basic assumptions.  I can reference articles in
EE Times and elsewhere, and people who watch TV already know this from
things like AT&T's "you will" commercials.
Seems to be that a general videophone capability is the only building block
that's needed.  Seems to me the only possible roadblock is regulatory, that
is, the phone companies being prohibited from doing video and the cable
companies prevented from doing phone service.
