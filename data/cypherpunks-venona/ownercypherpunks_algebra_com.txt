The local radio station just played a soundbite explaining that the "Anthrax" was not viable, and could not have been used to develop a weapon. They went on to state that the perpetrator was a "disgruntled scam artist whose scheme to make money off the Internet had failed."
If they can't get anything out of the bio weapons angle, there's always the 'net angle. The news goobers are catching onto the concept of "object

Obviously web sites can determine my IP address for any given session; they can also look at cookies left by themselves and other sites.
Can anyone point me to where I can learn exactly what other information is made available (browser version?, OS version?, system name?, user name?, etc.)?

behavior that the parents failed to address after being requested to do so.
Would you want your children class with another child who repeatedly went into room-smashing rages with no appearant consequences for such behavior???
Sounds like the parents failed to "get around to" the counseling, and the school forced the issue.

I have lived in Raleigh, North Carolina my entire life (over 30 yrs).
County governments consist of an elected board of commissioners who have
the power to make such decisions and expenditures without holding public
hearings on these matters.  Unless the local media jumps on one of these
proposals weeks in advance, nobody will even know about it or have an
opportunity to petition for a public hearing.  Once the county
commisioners vote on and approve it, our money is spent and the public has
no recourse (until the next election).  Here in Raleigh, Wake County, NC,
for instance, we have a Republican county commissioner and a board of
members.  When I heard from his daughter, a personal friend, about his
plans to cut funding to drug education and rehab programs and redirect all
of those funds to the county prison system, I decided to act.  I contacted
the commissioner himself, his office, and even had lunch with his wife and
daughter to discuss this issue.  As a family friend, I thought I would at
least be able to get a friendly, receptive ear.  His wife and daughter
were in full agreement with me, but the commissioner dismissed all of my
suggestions and pleas.  In fact, he told me that I was "high on crack" for
even suggesting that he *not* cut spending to drug education and rehab
programs.  i then appealed to the media, the public, and various county
drug rehab and education facilities and tried to petition for public
hearings on the issue.  After getting stonewalled by the GOP-controlled
county board of commissioners, funding to drug rehab and education
programs was cut by over 50%.  Since that time (two years ago), drug
arrests and convictions, violent crime, murder, non-violent crimes,
and admissions to treatment centers have all risen, in all of the basic
statistical measurement categories.
Wake county taxes have increased dramatically (almost 50%), and we have
just completed building a new county jail and several county jail annex
facilities.  In both percentage and numbers, our county jail population is
at the highest rate it has ever been.
On a related note, seven of the Wake county sherriff's deputies, who all
had laptop computers (with Internet access) in their cruisers, were
recently busted for spending all of their time on the clock surfing the
web and going to porno websites and adult chatrooms.  One of the deputies
has been arrested for using a sherriff's department scanner to scan in a
picture of his genitals which he then sent to a young girl, a minor, from
his cruiser while on duty.
Additionally, the officer in charge of the weapons armory for the
sherriff's department, which contains full-auto weapons such as the HK MP5
and the M16, was recently dismissed because it was discovered that he had
been spending all of his time on the clock in another section of the
building surfing adult sites on the web.  Meanwhile, the armory was left
unlocked, deputies were unable to get their weapons serviced within a
reasonable period of time, and an M16 "disappeared".
My tax dollars at work...
Next...i'll fill you in on some of the more interesting discoveries I made
while working for the NC Dept of Crime Control and Public Safety.  They
don't need satellites to watch you here in Raleigh...they have hi-tech,
hi-res cameras perched on top of all the tallest buildings, in the
projects, at selected street corners, and various other points.
so much for your privacy...

So do Anguillan ones. And Boston ones, but they get edited out for talking
too much. And not having the requisite goatee ;-). Anyway, when they do pay
attention to these things moneypunks are more interested places in like
Financial Times, Institutional Investor, and of course Forbes. :-). Nikkei,
which is the Japanese equivalent of the Wall Street Journal, will do.  Of
course, J. Pierpont Morgan hired a PR man to keep J. P. Morgan & Co., Inc.,
*out* of the papers. I expect that'll happen soon enough... :-).
Thank you.
There were three lists, each with it's own group of paid ringers. One about
the net in general, with Rheingold on it, one on the net in Asia, with no
one I recognised, and one on net commerce, with me. :-). I was just warming
them all up for the next rant, which will be more on finance, with the
stuff at the end. That rant will only go to the commerce list.
Oops. Drag. Even a spelling checker would have caught that one...
I know the story about the mortician. The point I was trying to make was
that AT&T were "incentivized", by the cost of regulation, certainly, but
mostly by economics in general, to automate switching, not that they
invented the electromechanical switch in particular.
Actually, with anonymous bearer settlement, like with blind signatures, you
still need a perfect pseudonym to clear the trade, which, modulo a few
biometric peculiarities which I wrote a 40k rant about here in December
:-), is perfect anonymity. That pseudonym can have reputation, which is
(roughly) orthogonal to the biometric identity of the person owning that
pseudonym's private key.
Anyway, the whole point to bearer-settled transactions is that you're
trusting the issuer as far as the integrity of the certificates themselves
are concerned. First by the financial reputation of the issuer, and then by
the ability to inspect and validate the certificates when they're exchanged.
Since we haven't figured out a way to do a workable offline protocol,
modulo hints of one on the FC98 program :-), the problem of inspection is
handled by using an on-line protocol, which, in the case of Chaum,
essentially issues new, but blinded, certificates in the "name" of the
public key accepting them for payment or receipt. For larger value
transactions, anyway. The whole issue of doing a transaction offline with
current bearer settlement technology is obviously a question of financial
risk. I claim that the cost of bearer protocols, even when you reissue
blinded bearer certificates for every transaction, will still be cheaper
than book-entry settlement. It'll certainly be faster to clear and settle.
The exception to this, of course, is micropayments, where hash collision
tokens like MicroMint and hashcash, will probably be tested stocastically
for double spending, and expiration and other thing will probably handle
the rest. Since these will eventually be device-level payment systems, I
expect that fraudulent devices will have a harder time operating if their
reputation goes than people will, but maybe not.
The problem of the reputation of the issuer is simply a matter of
demonstrating nonperformance of the obligation represented by the bearer
Which brings us to the parties using the certificates for exchange. I
expect the functional anonymity of blinded bearer protocols will be good
enough, but, like I said before, if someone wants to accept
second-generation offline blinded certificates in payment, their
willingness to do so is a function of financial risk. More to the point,
the reciever can test these certificates, and the person who offers them
for exchange is simply out their value if they turn out to be double spent,
so the risk is actually borne by the spender, same as it ever was.
Finally, there's the issue of fraud outside the integrity of bearer
certificates. Again, it's a function of financial risk. For low value
transactions, even the use of a perfect pseudonym is not necessary, and you
could use utterly anonymous transaction. However, I expect that persistant
perfect pseudonymity will be the rule, and that it will be functional
enough anonymity (modulo the biometric problems of transaction analysis I
talked about in December) for even the most decerning cypherpunk.
Say 'amen', somebody. :-). If, as I claim, digital bearer settlement can
reduce the cost of transactions by three orders of magnitude over all forms
of book-entry settlement, then we'll have no choice to adopt them. As
people quite familiar with Moore's Law, we all know how much money can be
made when you reduce the cost of doing something so much. The rest, of
course, will be history. :-).

Well you have definatly jumped off the deep end on this one Tim. If we
were talking a teenager going out of control then I would agree with you.
A 5 year old though??
If a teacher can not subdue and control a 5 year old little girl without
resorting to physical violence or calling in the storm troopers it's time
to look for another line of work.
When have you ever been so quick to blindly believe the spindoctoring of

I tried to buy some chemicals down here with cash about six months ago. They
tried everything they could to get me to write a check and in the end I
stormed out of the building, leaving the merchandise on the counter. I
haven't been back yet, and there's probably a good chance that the security
camera footage was sent to the FBI. Come to think of it, that would explain
some rather wierd incidents I've observed since then.
People say that the only reason to pay in cash is if you have something to
hide. You're damned right. The last thing I want is a bunch of government shills keeping track of what I buy so that they can stage some raid because they have a record of me paying for a beaker "which could be used" to mix chemicals which "could be used" as explosives, or metal "which could be used" to make thermite which "could be used" for some nefarious purpose.
In America today if you have interests in biology, chemistry, or physics it
is considered grounds by both the government and the pathetic sheep to shoot
you. Pardon me if I'm a little bit paranoid these days. It used to be
intellectuals were just beat up and made fun of by the others in schools.
Now it's fashionable to throw them in jail or kill them. "Unauthorized and illegitimate research:" what a stupid concept.
The American people consider anybody who does things in secret to be
automatically guilty. Forget the principles that America was founded on! When the government sends the ninjas into your home because you were going 56 mph
when you passed a cop on the highway and looked over at him the wrong way
they sieze your computer. They find that you're running Linux. Oooh, you
must be evil because your computer is password protected but the Microshaft
apologist across the hall has his computer wide open. They find that you
have blocks of random data on your drive, and even if they don't get them
decrypted because they *ARE* blocks of completely random data they wave it
in front of a jury and get a guilty verdict.
It's a sad, sad state of affairs.
It is when I read things like this that I realize how completely stupid the
entire government position is. Why do you need to buy ammonium nitrate to
make a bomb?
Assuming you just don't use something else which is more effective, why not
do this?
 NH OH + HNO --> NH NO  + H O
   3        3      3  3    2
So this naturally leads to the following question: Is having nitric acid and
ammonium hydroxide now a crime worthy of ninjas flying through your windows
with big guns in the middle of the night and shooting you because "you
looked like you were going for a weapon" when you flushed the toilet and
pulled your pants up?
Then if they don't have anything to charge you with they plant some drugs in
your toilet tank and claim that you were in "possession of drugs with
intention to distribute." Of course you were going to distribute them! You
had a truck and you frequently drove around! Exactly. Welcome to the shakedown extortion police state known as Amerika,
Land of the Freeh.

My sister teaches Kindergarten/first grade in the LA County School
District, specifically, Inglewood (shudder). She is forbidden to:
- physically touch the children in any way
- discipline them in any meaningful way
- flunk them if they fail to behave or learn what is supposedly required
("Flunking Kindergarten" is tough, so where this rule really become
significant is in the higher grades, where all kids are promoted, even
those who can't read, can't add, etc.)
My sister says the teachers have zero power to do anything, and the kids
know it.
Spare me the casual insults.
I call things as I see them. I've heard no spin-doctoring, just reports of
the child's behavior, admitted by her father.

Nixon made a very big deal of signing some papers which would supposedly
get rid of CBW supplies and research. This was back in 1972.
(I remember this clearly, because I was in college and my roomates and I,
all libertarians, hooted when the supposedly eliminated CBW weapons got
loose at Dugway Proving Grounds and killed a bunch of sheeple (er, "sheep")
in Utah...and an excellent and rage-inspiring movie with George C. Scott,
"Rage," had a similar theme. Highly recommended, if you can find it.)
What really happened is that a bunch of military bacteriological warfare
facilities were turned over to the private sector. Oh, and renamed "cancer
research," which looked good to the sheeple, as Nixon had just declared a
War on Cancer.
So, Litton Bionetics took a big piece, the National Cancer Institute
formally took over some of the military's labs (but the staff remained
unchanged, and some of the military brass "retired" to these
now-civilianized facilities), and things went on as usual. Well, not "as
usual," as it appears the secret side of governtment drastically stepped-up
work on biological and chemical weapons.
And the stockpiles still exist, of course. Some are corroding inside VX
warheads near Hanford, Washington (a good place to be far away from). Some
are stockpiled in Germany, apparently too dangerous to even move. And some
are no doubt stockpiled in lots of other places.
Here's a little personal story:
I worked for two summers in one of the labs probably related to this whole
thing. I worked in an immunology lab in the summers of 1969 and 1970,
working on immunoassay methods. My job was mundane, to run experiments
directed by others, to bleed mice for their serum, to run centrifuges, and
so on. Others in the lab worked with monkeys, on cancer, and hepatitus.
Yep, we had one of the first clean rooms in the nation, with double
airlocks, devoted to Hepatitus B (I think it was). All of this in a
nondescript warehouse building in Springfield, Virginia, just down Highway
95 from Washington. The company was initially Melpar, then the lab was spun
off into Melloy Labs. Some of the labs, Melpar at least, were sold to
E-Systems, the spook/SIGINT private contractor.
(For those who live, or lived, in the D.C. area, here are a few more
details. The lab was originally at the Arlington Boulevard facility of
Melpar, near the intersection with the Beltway. The biological labs were
spun-off and moved to West Springfield in 1970.)
I hadn't thought about this work for many years, until in the past couple
of years I've been reading up on the history of AIDS and the military's
work on monkey viruses. (Books, "Hot Zone," "AIDS, Ebola, and Emerging
Viruses," "Mary, Ferry, and the Monkey Virus," etc.)
It turns out that the period 1969-73 was a period of "privatizing" much
research that the military had formerly done. Several labs affiliated with
defense contractors were actively working with monkey cultures, and
maintaining contacts with Fort Detrick, the NIH, and the NCI. One figure
that stands out in this time period is Dr. Robert Gallo, who later achieved
fame for his HIV discovery (prior credit is often given to the French head
of the Pasteur Institute, Dr. Luc M.). I honestly have no way of recalling
if Gallo was circulating through our lab, or if the doctors I worked for
(Dr. Anne Jackson and Dr. Frederick Hyams) had contact with him.
As I learn more about this period, and the links between Hepatitus-B, AIDS,
and the timing of the big AIDS/HIV outbreak in the late 70s and early 80s,
I can't help wondering if the lab I worked in was involved in this whole
affair. A lot of things match up closely, and the absorbtion of Melpar into
E-Systems is part of the coincidences.
But all of this was a long time ago, before many of you were born.
The larger issue is that the spook side of government is only the tip of
the iceberg. For every $600 million "unindentified" building out past
Dulles Airport, eventually identified as the new headquarters of the
supersecret National Reconnaissance Organization (NRO), there are many
times as many "contractors" and "subcontractors" doing work too sensitive
even for the government to do. In fact, the unknown huge building in the
Virginia countryside was officially labelled as a Rockwell building, if I
recall correctly.)
(Readers may be familiar with Wackenhut, Science Applications, MITRE, etc.
Besides the large aerospace companies, all with large spook divisions, and
all with outlying offices doing work that few in the parent companies are
even cleared to know about.)
This is precisely the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us
about in his Farewell Speech, and that Washington in effect warned us about
in _his_ speech, when he warned about foreign entanglements and foreign
Footnote: Did the U.S. government and its subcontractors develop HIV as a
biological weapon? To be tested in Africa, as some suggest? Or was it an
accident, an accident let out of the labs of the Naval Health Sciences labs
(later Litton Bionetics) the East Bay of the Bay Area (site of many early
AIDS cases)? Or is it true that HIV viruses have been found in biological
specimens preserved for 40 years? And even if some HIV-like viruses existed
in nature, could the U.S. have isolated it and concentrated it in those
labs doing the work I described in the early 70s?
I don't know the answer to these questions. As my favorite researcher into
these matters puts it, "Food for thought and grounds for further research."
(Dave Emory, whose tapes can be bought. Use web search engines to find URLs
if interested.)
One thing I know for sure, the "secret" side of government is far larger
than most people think.

Those of you who are parents of toddlers and have watched in horror as
other parents seem to have zero control over their children, would
understand why the school reacted this way.  Getting the police involved
may not necessarily be the "right" thing to do, but there is a LOT of
pressure on public schools to be passive or suffer the wrath of
child-abuse lawsuits.
There are many times when they respond with "we don't do things that way
..." when they should just send the kid home.  There is no middle ground
where both the school and the parents are happy, unless the parents
really care and participate.  Getting the police involved was probably
just a way for the teachers and/or the administrators to pass the buck
to someone else because they feel powerless to deal with the situation.

Along similar lines, the state of texas recently (last year) made it illegal to post information such as drivers license numbers and whatnot on the net. The company that was doing so promptly moved its web server from dallas to antigua. Gee, seems like they had an effective law eh?
The problem is, the company was getting the information from the state in the first place. Anyone with a bit of cash can buy the entire drivers license database from the state of texas on CD-rom. Rather than criminalizing private actions, it would have been much better for the state to just =stop selling the information=! The databases already held would quickly become stale, and the problem would pretty much go away.
The state sees such things as revenue streams they are intitled to. Even though citizen-units cannot opt out of the database, they will sell it to anyone who has the $$$ they are asking for it. This is a great example of exactly how much respect a government agency has for your privacy.
For instance, here is the information contained on George Bush's drivers Name: BUSH,GEORGE HERBERT

We've been having some interesting discussions in scruz.general, my local
newsgroup. (We get together every few months for a "scruzfest," so a sense
of community amonst the discussants has been emerging. I probably now know
more folks by sight in scruz.general than I know Cypherpunks.)
I will forward a couple of my articles.

No one knows what the laws on cryptography in the US are, least of all the courts or the lawyers.
There is a law against exporting armaments, or indeed doing diddly squat with armaments, and the bureaucrats have decreed crypto an armament, however they have displayed profound reluctance to take this issue to court, so the implications of such a law, and such a definition remain entirely unknown.
However since no one has yet been actually indicted, it is unlikely that you will be the first.      --digsig

Tim May is spot on about the feral kid. Yet, battering the clone bruises the produce and harms sales.
Kids are over-coddled species and that's the cause of the rise in black market of kiddie porn, kidnapping, rape, incest and murder, what with crazed adults (parents and wannabes) wanting to develop for home domination hyper-valued Benets, since they're worth more on the market as icons than as needy brats begging for affection and attention, and interfering with dad and mom getting on with maximum self-indulgence.
And there's way too many kids, anyhow, the market's saturated. Especially those over the age of adorable cuddling and grandma gaga for adverts. Harvest all over the age of two, say, when they become unruly, as the Brit pedophagist proposed for the Irish surplus to solve the famine. Shut the day cares, schools, colleges,
boot camps for homicidals. Unplug the Net for those under 30,
they're more socially useful as protein, as anciently preached
by St. Peter's Eunuchs.
Eat the kids, doom the race. Evolution stops with the me-gen.
The technical solution to the after-me-nada agribusiness is set out in Tim's aggra-sig:

Just like the Heaven's Gate site.
Interesting that the U.S.  Government uses a twice-convicted fraudster
selling a snake oil medical device as its confidential informant.
Here's to hoping Harris and Leavitt sue for false arrest. Last Olympics it
was Richard Jewell, this Olympics it's these guys.
But the corrections are being given less coverage than the original lurid,
headline news, so the Administration will have gotten what it wanted.

I don't disagree with the larger point.
The solution is the one libertarians have argued for for many years:
provide choice in schools. Then a school could pick and choose its pupils,
and vice versa.
But with the system as it stands now, a child who throws chairs, bites,
kicks, and whatnot needs to be dealt with.
One of the very few legitimate functions of a government is police action.
Against assaults, by assaulters of whatever age.
While we may think it is "ludicrous" for the police to be called in,
consider the alternative. Is the teacher supposed to allow herself to be
hit over the head with chairs, even if wielded by 5-year-olds?
The system is fucked up, to be sure. But automatically arguing that the
school should not have called in the police given the constraints they are
under is foolish.

That        is a number somewhere around 1000 000 000 000 000 000        000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000         000 000 000 000 000        So the secret generated from your secret key is really        a very big number.        The public key, which appears in your signature, is an        elliptic point, the generator multiplied by that         number. This point is represented by the x coordinate        of the elliptic point, a 255 bit number, plus a sign         bit, represented in base 64 format.  Rick Smith
Not so.
For example how could a man in the middle pass himself off as the author of Crypto Kong?
Exactly so.
Any document is potentially a certificate. Commonly you wish to link a document to network reputation, rather than a physical person.  For this purpose PGP key signing parties are largely irrelevant.   Verisign certificates primarily work to link your digital signature to your credit rating, and thus, unfortunately, also liink your digital signature to the number of the beast.
At present there is insufficient internet commerce for a credit rating not linked to the number of the beast to be useful, though this may change in the future.
John Doe usually wishes to avoid a MITM attack because his reputation is valuable.  He fears Malloc will use that reputation for Mallocs own purposes.
If John Doe's reputation is valuable, he has emitted many communications over a lengthy time.
If these are signed, and each signature contains John Doe's public key, Malloc cannot perform a man in the middle attack,
and thus cannot steal John Doe's reputation, or use it for
his own purposes.     --digsig

Probably not.  I can see why someone might think that, though.  I'm doing
this from recollection, not research; corrections are welcome.
Obviously, US law says that US crypto software is export-controlled,
including re-exports.
Under EAR (Commerce export regs) a minimum content rule takes account of
how US-ness dilutes, e.g., a US part is US but if it's incorporated into a
foreign car that doesn't make the foreign car US.
Exception:  no minimum content rule for crypto items.  Take the PGP plug-in
for Eudora and integrate it into a foreign OS.  Even if that's the only
crypto in the OS it's enough.  Can't dilute US-ness of US crypto.
The hypo by Anonymous, however, presumes US code that isn't crypto code.
Foreign crypto is mixed with US non-crypto code.  That's different.
I've heard of no US action in this regard; be interested to know of any.
Other countries also have minimum content rules, e.g., Canada.  But Canada,
I heard, has no crypto exception.  So at some point, I think, a crypto item
stops being US under Canadian export law, but still is US under US law.
Obvious conflict.

There was no mention of a "pattern of behavior" in any of the local

drew the attention of the national media.
BTW how would you like *your* child arrested and booked on Felony charges

It occurs to me that society has been restructured so that "the
authorities" are the only ones permitted to fix many sorts of
commonly-encountered problems  which individual citizens used to be able
to take care of themselves. Like spanking a spoiled 5 year old child
instead of charging her with a felony.  Further, said authorities have
great and arbitrary powers to fix things however they want.
Combine this regular dependence on arbitrary authority with an Orwellian
database of Good Citizens and Troublemakers in the hands of that authority
and what have you got?  A cowed citizenry, to say the least.

I tried to buy some chemicals down here with cash about six months ago. They
tried everything they could to get me to write a check and in the end I
stormed out of the building, leaving the merchandise on the counter. I
haven't been back yet, and there's probably a good chance that the security
camera footage was sent to the FBI. Come to think of it, that would explain
some rather wierd incidents I've observed since then.
People say that the only reason to pay in cash is if you have something to
hide. You're damned right. The last thing I want is a bunch of government shills keeping track of what I buy so that they can stage some raid because they have a record of me paying for a beaker "which could be used" to mix chemicals which "could be used" as explosives, or metal "which could be used" to make thermite which "could be used" for some nefarious purpose.
In America today if you have interests in biology, chemistry, or physics it
is considered grounds by both the government and the pathetic sheep to shoot
you. Pardon me if I'm a little bit paranoid these days. It used to be
intellectuals were just beat up and made fun of by the others in schools.
Now it's fashionable to throw them in jail or kill them. "Unauthorized and illegitimate research:" what a stupid concept.
The American people consider anybody who does things in secret to be
automatically guilty. Forget the principles that America was founded on! When the government sends the ninjas into your home because you were going 56 mph
when you passed a cop on the highway and looked over at him the wrong way
they sieze your computer. They find that you're running Linux. Oooh, you
must be evil because your computer is password protected but the Microshaft
apologist across the hall has his computer wide open. They find that you
have blocks of random data on your drive, and even if they don't get them
decrypted because they *ARE* blocks of completely random data they wave it
in front of a jury and get a guilty verdict.
It's a sad, sad state of affairs.
It is when I read things like this that I realize how completely stupid the
entire government position is. Why do you need to buy ammonium nitrate to
make a bomb?
Assuming you just don't use something else which is more effective, why not
do this?
 NH OH + HNO --> NH NO  + H O
   3        3      3  3    2
So this naturally leads to the following question: Is having nitric acid and
ammonium hydroxide now a crime worthy of ninjas flying through your windows
with big guns in the middle of the night and shooting you because "you
looked like you were going for a weapon" when you flushed the toilet and
pulled your pants up?
Then if they don't have anything to charge you with they plant some drugs in
your toilet tank and claim that you were in "possession of drugs with
intention to distribute." Of course you were going to distribute them! You
had a truck and you frequently drove around! Exactly. Welcome to the shakedown extortion police state known as Amerika,
Land of the Freeh.

I tried to buy some chemicals down here with cash about six months ago. They
tried everything they could to get me to write a check and in the end I
stormed out of the building, leaving the merchandise on the counter. I
haven't been back yet, and there's probably a good chance that the security
camera footage was sent to the FBI. Come to think of it, that would explain
some rather wierd incidents I've observed since then.
People say that the only reason to pay in cash is if you have something to
hide. You're damned right. The last thing I want is a bunch of government shills keeping track of what I buy so that they can stage some raid because they have a record of me paying for a beaker "which could be used" to mix chemicals which "could be used" as explosives, or metal "which could be used" to make thermite which "could be used" for some nefarious purpose.
In America today if you have interests in biology, chemistry, or physics it
is considered grounds by both the government and the pathetic sheep to shoot
you. Pardon me if I'm a little bit paranoid these days. It used to be
intellectuals were just beat up and made fun of by the others in schools.
Now it's fashionable to throw them in jail or kill them. "Unauthorized and illegitimate research:" what a stupid concept.
The American people consider anybody who does things in secret to be
automatically guilty. Forget the principles that America was founded on! When the government sends the ninjas into your home because you were going 56 mph
when you passed a cop on the highway and looked over at him the wrong way
they sieze your computer. They find that you're running Linux. Oooh, you
must be evil because your computer is password protected but the Microshaft
apologist across the hall has his computer wide open. They find that you
have blocks of random data on your drive, and even if they don't get them
decrypted because they *ARE* blocks of completely random data they wave it
in front of a jury and get a guilty verdict.
It's a sad, sad state of affairs.
It is when I read things like this that I realize how completely stupid the
entire government position is. Why do you need to buy ammonium nitrate to
make a bomb?
Assuming you just don't use something else which is more effective, why not
do this?
 NH OH + HNO --> NH NO  + H O
   3        3      3  3    2
So this naturally leads to the following question: Is having nitric acid and
ammonium hydroxide now a crime worthy of ninjas flying through your windows
with big guns in the middle of the night and shooting you because "you
looked like you were going for a weapon" when you flushed the toilet and
pulled your pants up?
Then if they don't have anything to charge you with they plant some drugs in
your toilet tank and claim that you were in "possession of drugs with
intention to distribute." Of course you were going to distribute them! You
had a truck and you frequently drove around! Exactly. Welcome to the shakedown extortion police state known as Amerika,
Land of the Freeh.

Perhaps someone from this list would be kind enough to explain to the
obviously ignorant just how one manages to DL from replay.com without encountering the following problem:
I have tried DLing this file (and others) from more than one server, and at different times, but encounter the same error each time, so obviously I don't know what I am doing. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Exactly. As far as I'm concerned, if the "educators" act physically
theatening towards any student then the student is perfectly within his or
her rights to beat the living shit out of the "teacher." It's classic. The government has a monopoly on violence, even in schools. If
an "educator" beats up a student it's "discipline." If a student beats up
another student it's a "boys will be boys" situation which gets a slap on
the hand. But a student better not touch an "educator" or all kinds of hell
will rain down on them, including expulsion from a facility they have to pay
for anyway, and criminal charges.
There was a situation much like this in Texas a while back that I heard about.
Fuck the screwools.
