I haven't read the SSL spec for a while but my understanding was that the server passed it's public key to the client via a certificate signed by a mutually trusted certificate authority (i.e., Verisign).
How would the filter be able to forge such a certificate ?

Yes, but the certificate that contains the public key of the server is digital signed by the certificate authority (CA).
To create such a certificate requires the secret key of the CA.
The public key of the CA is contained in the client software, which uses it to verify the validity of the server certificate.

I don't think binding hostnames to certificates helps much because both hostnames and IP addresses can be spoofed and DNS servers can be subverted.  The important thing is the binding to the "service" name or definition (e.g. InterState online banking service).
Well of course, if the secret key of the server (or worse yet, certificate authority) is compromised, all bets are off.  That's true of just about any protocol you can dream up.
Are you just referring to the problem of accurate and up to date certificate revocation lists (CRL) being available ?
If so, you're right, this is a very difficult problem to solve without having a truly reliable and pervasive key-distribution & CRL system deployed throughout the world.

Of course, the attacker would be leaving a very strong pointer back to themselves as evidence.
I'm not sure this is really an issue of where the security is layered, but rather a flaw in the use of it, in not requiring the unambiguous specification of the "service name" (what's in the certificate) beforehand, or confirming it after the connection is established.  You must have a binding between the target URL and the desired "service name", regardless of whether you have the security protocol in the session layer (SSL) or the application/http layer (Secure-HTTP).
