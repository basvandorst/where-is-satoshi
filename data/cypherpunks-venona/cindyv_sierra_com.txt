Sierra On-Line E-News                  Issue 1.1, April 1996
If  you prefer futuristic combat, then perhaps you're ready to fight that final desperate battle against Cybrid world domination.  In the newly-released EarthSiege 2, that war will turn about as vicious as a mother rhino protecting her young.  All-new HERCs with all-new weaponry maximize the possibility for destructive fun.  And if you ever found yourself playing the original EarthSiege and saying, "You know, I could take that bad boy out in three seconds if this thing could only FLY," you're in luck;  one of the new HERCs is an airborne combat monster.  So sign on for another tour of duty, and this time we'll promise you the dream of every HERC pilot ... bigger guns.

If you've got kids, then you're probably very familiar with Saturday morning cartoons.  Kids and `toons go together like peanut butter and jelly (or, in my cousin's house,  peanut butter and waffles ... bleah).  Now you can give your kids the tools to create their very own cartoons on your home PC or Mac.  Sierra's new Playtoons series gives kids a chance to write, direct, edit, record, and play a nearly limitless set of animated sequences in a variety of absurd and fun situations.  Educators would say that it "promotes creative thinking."  This is true, but personally what I would say is that it keeps them off the TV so you can watch reruns of "The Dukes of Hazzard".  (Two great reasons to pick up a copy!)  Look for no less than four new Playtoons titles in the near future.
WEB NEWS
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  If it's been a while since the last time you logged onto our website, there's a few good reasons to go take another look.  One I think you'll particularly like is our new Chat area.  (Right now, this area is open to Netscape 2.0 users only, but we're working on it!)   We'll be using the Chat forum to host regular conferences with game designers and developers.  To start it off, we hosted a discussion on Friday, March 15th, with the designers of the upcoming Front Page Sports: Baseball `96.  And to celebrate the fact that we signed last season's Cy Young award winner Randy Johnson to help us out with this new game, we even gave away free Sierra products during the chat session.  Sound cool?  Then be there for the next one!
THE VIRTUAL STORE
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  Never got around to dogfighting those German aces?  Somehow neglected to find time to build that worldwide automobile manufacturing empire?  Spent the last two years sitting on your butt instead of getting out there and saving the environment?  GREAT!  It's always nice to meet a fellow procrastinator, so we'd like to reward your tardiness with fabulous prices on the games you missed out on.   We call them the SierraOriginals, and we're selling them for dirt-cheap.  $14.95 will get you any of these titles on CD-ROM:  Red Baron (plus a free copy of A-10 Tank Killer), Detroit, EcoQuest: The Search for Cetus, The Even More Incredible Machine, Quest for Glory IV, King's Quest VI, Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards (and this isn't the old type-`til-you-bleed version either, but the updated point-and-click interface), Gobliiins, Gobliins 2 (yes, the preceding two titles do indeed contain the correct number of "i"s), my personal favorite (for sheer mayhem value), The!
 Incredible Toon Machine, or just a mess of other titles.  You can find them in your local software store,  or order them directly from our website's online store or from the legion of telephone customer service representatives at 1-800-SIERRA5.  Then you can tell that third-grade teacher who used to lecture you about punctuality that you paid about thirty bucks less per game than she did.
          ONE MORE THING
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  If you're anything like me, the one thing better than dirt-cheap games is free games, so I'll throw a few of those in here as well.  I just so happen to have a big batch of SierraOriginals titles sitting at my desk (got them through the departmental budget by calling them "research materials") and I'm holding a contest to give `em away.  And since I hate random drawings (since they involve no thought) and essay contests (since I'd have to read all your entries, and I do have somewhere I need to go this year), we're going to do this a little bit differently.  One of the SierraOriginals is "Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards."  There are a lot of letters in that game title, and if they were in a different order, it stands to reason that they'd make other words and sentences.  What I'm looking for is the most creative sentence which can be made from the letters in the game title.  You don't have to use all of the letters, but each letter can only be used once (t!
here's only one "g" in the title, so there'd better only be one "g" in the sentence).  You may use as much punctuation as you need.  Send your sentences to PRIZE  Whichever entry I think is the coolest (that's right, just me, no panel of impartial judges, sorry) wins your choice of any FIVE SierraOriginals games.  That should keep you busy for a while.
And that's about everything I can fit into one issue.  Fun info next month on Betrayal In Antara and the Mac version of Space Quest 6, so stay tuned, and happy gaming!
