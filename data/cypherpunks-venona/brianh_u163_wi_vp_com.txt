@_subject: Mail at the office 
I would like to know if there is anyway to keep a record of what is
happening on my machine at work.  I have had all my personal e-mail
deleted twice now over the weekend.  My employer has no problems with
the employees recieving non work related e-mail.  I'm on a unix enviroment.  I have written a simple program to let me
know who logins on my machine, but it doesn't provide enough
information anymore.  I have talked with the sys.admin but he doesn't
know what to do either.  I have tried to find a sniffer thats already
compiled for i can not compile anything here, but have had no success.
Any help or pointers would be Greatly Apreciated
please reply by private e-mail so the noise level doesn't increase on
my account.
