EURO HOLOGRAM IS MISSING
Somewhere between Paris and Munich, a unique hologram design, intended to
deter counterfeiting of the new euro currency, has turned up missing.  The
French-made hologram was on its way to a high-security printer near
Nuremberg for testing.  One European Union monetary official called the
disappearance "startling" and there's speculation that the EU may have to
change the design of its high-denomination euro banknotes, due to be issued
in 2002.  The hologram was designed by a small business in Paris and was
taken to be loaded onto an Air France flight at Roissy airport by Brink's
security services.  Officials in Paris say the theft bears the hallmarks of
a well-organized crime, as only an expert would understand the significance
of the hologram in the note-printing process.  (Financial Times 21 May 98)

The Internet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
Your question was:
And in response, thus spake the Oracle:
}   In a way, you have come to the right place, Supplicant.  Some of my best
} friends are spooks.  Generally, they like to be known as "The Intangible
} Ones", but that's a bit of pretentiousness on their parts.  "Ghoul",
} "ghost", "spirit", and "weird white smudge on film" all are appropriate
} names.
}   Some of their favorite haunts, if you will, tend to be different than
} what current culture dictates.  For example, spooks will not hang out in
} old houses.  Too many cobwebs, bugs, and general naughtiness.  Spooks are
} very sensitive creatures, and prefer to relax in libraries, arboretums,
} Newt Gingrich's bedroom -- places where nothing ever happens.
}   There's not much else to spooks, dear Supplicant.  They're really quite
} nice and friendly, and I recommend you make them a big steak dinner every
} once in a while.  Leave it out on the table, and make sure you tell me
} your address so I can come by... er, so I can notify the spooks.
} } You owe the Oracle some new potatoes to go with that steak.

U.S. claims success in curbing encryption trade
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Clinton administration officials
Thursday said they had persuaded other leading countries to
impose strict new export controls on computer
data-scrambling products under the guise of arms control.
At a meeting Thursday in Vienna, the 33 nations that have
signed the Wassenaar Arrangement limiting arms exports --
including Japan, Germany and Britain -- agreed to impose
controls on the most powerful data-scrambling technologies,
including for the first time mass-market software, U.S.
special envoy for cryptography David Aaron told Reuters.
The United States, which restricts exports of a wide range of
data-scrambling products and software -- also known as
encryption -- has long sought without success to persuade
other countries to impose similar restrictions.
``We think this is very important in terms of bringing a level
playing field for our exporters,'' Aaron said.
Leading U.S. high-technology companies, including Microsoft
Corp. and Intel Corp., have complained that the lack of
restrictions in other countries hampered their ability to
compete abroad. The industry has sought to have U.S.
restrictions relaxed or repealed, but has not asked for tighter
controls in other countries.
Privacy advocates have also staunchly opposed U.S. export
controls on encryption, arguing that data-scrambling
technologies provided a crucial means of protecting privacy in
the digital age.
``It's ironic, but the U.S. government is leading the charge
internationally to restrict personal privacy and individual
liberty around the world,'' said Alan Davidson, staff counsel at
the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington-based
advocacy group.
Special envoy Aaron said the Wassenaar countries agreed to
continue export controls on powerful encryption products in
general but decided to end an exemption for widely available
software containing such capabilities.
``They plugged a loophole,'' Aaron said.
The new policy also reduced reporting and paperwork
requirements and specifically excluded from export controls
products that used encryption to protect intellectual property
