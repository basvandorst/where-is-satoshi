@_subject: raygun shielding 
not being an authority on the uses of X-Ray technology, I have no idea how useful tinfoil or gold lamme would be for shielding. As a professional photographer, I do know that one can purchase lead lied bags to protectect one's film from being ruined by the X-Ray machines at the airport. They do not work. When the customs people come to an object in your bag that they can not see into, they turn up the power until they can. I have ruined film and customs officer testimony to back this up, that's why I have them do a visual inspection of my film. If you have a lot, they don't look very hard, which has it's own bundle of opportunity right there. Not that I am advocating that kind of behavior.

Okay, from the top: there are a number of reasons why this won't happen. One of the most obvious being that businesses are NOT in the business of helping people, they are in the business of making money. Trade will not become free, travel will not become cheaper, and if they are given the powers of a government they would not likely let it's consumer base move to a country with a better dental plan, thus borders would not become more open. In fact, I can easily picture business leaders inthe throes of ecstacy over the prospect of having 260 million people who have no choice but to buy their product because there are no other manufacturers. Another
reson is that government is like a giant bumblebee, not too bright, but if
you keep poking at it with a sharp stick it will sting you. Government officials are interested in keeping their cushy jobs and expensive hookers, if they start to feel threatened by crypto anarchy, who do you think they're going to retaliate against? The guy who runs the blockbuster video on the corner? ever read "1984"? the appearance of a free lifestyle is most definitely not a free lifestyle. I am hardly a friend of the state, and far from being an advocate of the church, but multinational corporations running the world for their own fun and profit makes my sphincter clench. clint barnett

is this kind of crap really necessary? Are you that bored? If you have a problem, go to his house and beat him up. As for you Tim C. May, call your friends and wait in the bushes for this asshole to show up at your house. Maybe the rest of them will get the hint that this waste of time is deeply unappreciated.

if I'm not mistaken, large companies are able to purchase (in a way) government support. Special interest groups and large lobbying groups are also able to sway the government with either money , votes or things more insidious. You are absolutely right, big companies do get bigger because of (partly) government support of some form, but that's because they can afford to pay for it. clint barnett

It was not my intention to discredit the theory, in fact I believe I mentioned that in my original "e". When Canada changed to the Metric system, I went along with it, what could I do? Politicians raise my taxes, and I bear that burden as well. I don't like it, but I also take whatever I can get through the system. Ripping off the system by using the system is one of the best ways to get the system changed. If I went into a restaurant with an automatic weapon because I didn't like the way they were destroying the rainforests,it would get me on the evening news as a crazed gunman, not as somebody who likes trees. If you think thatyou can resist the NSA and win, more power to you, and I'll help if I can, but I don't think you can.However, I strongly believe that you have the power to limit the information they steal from you, and thereby limit the control they have over you. If you can keep your wits about you, act fast when you have to, and run away to fight another day, then you can maybe do some good, but don't make a martyr of yourself or anyone else, because martyrs can't write code, they can't attack or defend a system, they can only lay there and rot in jail or in the ground. clint barnett

or possibly a tube of epoxy to keep the cards together permanently, a few armed friends/sycophants to keep watch on the house of cards, perhaps a few mentally unbalanced people to kidnap or assasinate Person B's friends and family, some Marketing and PR men to drum up public support for the existance of the house of cards and make people think that it's good and deserves to be there, and on and on and on...
couldn't we all just get along?

no doubt everybody on the list recieved a spam about some personalised children's books. Having been away or a few weeks, I only just today got to replying to that message. I recieved a response indicating that my response was undeliverable due to the mailbox being full. I just wanted to say that I'm glad I'm not the only one who can't stand that crap.
