Silence doesn't necessarily denote agreement, especially from someone (for
example, me :) who avoids political posts altogether... That stylometry thing (figuring out who wrote a message from its content) seems to be a big problem for people using remailers. Initially, I thought you
could avoid it by using some software to tinker with your words. Although that
can confuse some attacks, there are still author-dependent things you can't
hide so easily. For example, someone with a sufficiently big sample of your
writing (i.e., all a nym's public traffic) could measure, say, the number words
per sentence, or how likely you are to use certain punctuation/function words,
and use that to match it to something you wrote under your own name. And the
measurement part isn't rocket science, either -- I slapped together a simple
stylometer from basic UNIX tools (sed, sort, uniq, grep) and a calculator, and
it appears to actually _work_.
(In addition to being able to say two messages are by the same person, it looks

Yes. To do it using standard proggies, hash each of your paragraphs and put the
results in a PGP-signed message. Quoter provides signature and signed hashes. Reader hashes your quoted paragraph and checks the signed message to see if it
was one of the original paragraphs. So simple I can do it. :) [Disclaimer: I think.]
A more cool-sounding solution would be to concatenate those hashes and sign
them (not a hash of them) as one packet. Since RSA sigs are secret-key
decryptions (right?), the reader can re-encrypt it and check any individual
hash. Not more secure, though, and it takes a lot of processor time.
No idea how to do it with bit-level granularity.

That's a signature. Quoting in the real world is like that (although that would allow you to
transpose/repeat sentences [?]). The problem is more one of having too much to
sign (processor time/bandwidth), but I think you're always going to have that
with a small granularity. Also, when not using a hash, you have to worry about
chosen-gidget attacks (see the excerpt from the PGP Attack FAQ after my

Well, have a system of certified remailers trusted to force their users to burn
up time at the sending end, so the ultimate recipient accepts their messages
w/o postage. One certified remailer accepts messages from others without any
postage, so only the original sender has to use up CPU time.

@_author: "Uhh...this is Joe [Randall Farmer]" 
@_subject: Re: hashcash spam prevention & firewalls 
This is exactly what I was addressing: remailers only have to get themselves
certified as remailers and then prove their certification to the destination
server, not do the whole hashcash shtick for every message. (For example, they
could publish their public key's hash signed by some anti-spam organization,
then sign the hash of the server's challenge to prove that they are a real
remailer, not an advanced spammer imitating one) Nope. The original sender provides hashcash to get into the remailer net, and
the receiver, after seeing the remailer's certificate, trusts that the original
sender spent some CPU time to send the message. The remailer doesn't have to
while away nearly as much of *its* CPU time, and spammers still couldn't send
many messages since they still have to waste their CPU cycles to do so.

Yah, so do I...I don't like things that allow abuse of discretion, but I
thought it was necessary -- I didn't know hashcash could be prepackaged when I
posted this. It's a moot point since it's not needed anyway, but if morbid curiosity
overwhelms you, read on...To summarize, no single organization would certify
remailers, not all hosts would need to be certified, and banning remailers
wouldn't be any harder than it is today. Well, the intention was for no single organization to certify remailers, but
rather to distribute the responsibility among anyone who can be trusted not to
certify a spammer. Individual gateways could choose whose certifications they
trusted if they thought some authorities were too restrictive or thought spam
was seeping through. Yes, I'd imagine CAUCE and Verisign (along with Infonex,
nym.alias.net, etc.) would try to set themselves up as authorities. NSA
wouldn't because they don't like remailers at all (except for those
identity-escrowed FORTEZZA-powered Big-Brother-friendly ones, which wouldn't
get users anyhow :). Not all hosts, just high-traffic ones for which other solutions (having users
exempt them from hashcash [for mailing lists] and having heavy users generate
their own hashcash [for ISPs]) won't work. This basically means remailers.
The certification scheme wasn't designed for rating but rather to let cracker
get by on less than 44 CPU-hours a day. They could already. Get Raph Levien's list and block mail from those addresses; unlisted remailers would be found soon enough. If you also used the
certification for some arbitrary non-remailer, non-spam servers, it would
probably be harder to use certification to ban remailers than to use the
remailer list.

Nyet. It can be phased in over time...people install the software, mailing

@_subject: Re: (eternity) Eternity as a secure filesystem/backup medium 
You can tilt the odds in your favor some at the cost of speed; use more rounds
for the block ciphers and base your public-key security on two hard problems,
not one (i.e., encrypt randomness with one public-key cryptosystem and encrypt
the key XORed with this randomness with an algorithm based on an unrelated hard
problem). That means much more work, but the insurance against improvements in
math/crypto is worth it, I'd think.
It *is* a little different, actually; confidential messages are rarely relevant
in 50 years (and even when they are, NSA doesn't know which messages are
relevant and which aren't), whereas authors must remain anonymous until they're
sufficiently dead that they can't be hurt (and NSA *does* have more of an idea
of which documents need to be looked into, since they know their contents).

Why does it matter? As long as she's competent enough to choose good verifiers
and verify that those verifiers verified the code in question, it all works out
in the end. Thresh is the number of signatures from trusted people/keys required to trust a
section of code, a value set by the user. An anonymous sig would be very little
good but I think he was talking about including the author's sig if he's not
anonymous. We don't. There is no way to operate without *some* trust; this reduces it from
the code being shown to be secure if the author is not spookized AND The author
is capable to check his/her code AND the key he signed it with is good to the
code being good if those conditions are true for one (or a few) of the many
cypherpunks on the user's trusted list who signed the code. Well, I think he's proposing to have a script check them and the user
personally make sure the script is doing what it should.
Not to mention churning out that propaganda for the NYT ad, becoming tolerant
to pepper spray, preparing various fake identities for use, proving Blowfish
secure and then breaking it, constructing a doomsday weapon using only a
straightedge and compass, etc.
Might be, but this code has to be more than just understood -- it must be
painstakingly checked for subtle flaws and bugs. Welcome to the world of
adversarial quality control.
The C/Java/whatever compiler, I suppose, and also the signature checker, and
she's checking that they carry out their stated purposes.
I think the issue was one of users who want to get eternity server source they
can trust -- not necessarily getting it *from* Eternity. Unless you're exposing a new weakness in the trust model PGP uses, Mallet can't
do that, providing the user has done good key authentication and hasn't listed
one of Mallet's goons as a trusted code-verifier.
Yup, that's why the user has to check it by hand. Lots easier to check a script
and a compiler for doing their functions than to check an eternity server for
subtle bugs. Well, if you can't verify it yourself and you can't trust other people to
verify it, my advice is to give up; you cannot be sure of *any* public keys in
that case, so any message you encrypt might be encrypted to one of Mallet's
keys; any sig you check might be signed by one of Mallet's keys.
If Mallet is a NSA spook who's half as good as my hacker buddy Phat Atta and
knew about the script ahead of time, the user can't trust the script without
verifying it herself, whether it takes milliseconds or millenia to get the
response. Ah, but either I am more mistaken than usual or you only need a few of the
signers to be trusted, not all of them. Not sure, but I think he's talking about putting up a key server in Eternity
(i.e., the rolling hills where data can roam without fear, as opposed to
putting it in the Eternity).

@_subject: Predicting cipher life / NSA rigged DES? / Destroying encrypted data (Tangent to Re: Burning papers) 
[These messages were postponed for trillions of years I finally sent them;
apologies if something is grossly outdated.]
Been thinking, most applications for ciphers assume solely based on cipher x's
keysize that data will be secure for a certain length of time. It'd be nice if
we had some way to estimate how long we can hope the cipher to last. Of course,
there's no way to predict anything for sure, but you could make an estimate.
I'm wondering if there's any way to make a more accurate prediction of how much
more analysis it will survive with fancy statistics or something. My idea --
which I know wouldn't work very well, which is why I'm asking if there's a way
to actually make a good guess -- is averaging the remaining lifetimes in
analysis-hours of broken ciphers which survived as many person-hours of attack
as the one in question.
Am I just going crazy, or is it kind of obvious that NSA knew the s-boxes they
provided for DES weren't secure? I mean, they pretty much had to know about the
attacks outside cryptographers are just now discovering -- they have more than
ten years of cryptographers' time every day, and they certainly knew about
differential cryptanalysis. Let's hope they don't meddle similarly in AES... One fairly simple feature for disk encryptors that came up during one of the
 (sp?) chats was that of using random numbers with the key
so you can demolish an encrypted volume in a split-second. Works like this:
there's one 192-bit (or whatever your keylength is) value which is a hash of
your passphrase. There's another value, this one a cryptographically random one
of the same size, stored on a fixed physical place on the disk. If you wish to
destroy the data on powerdown, there can be a third value stored in memory,
which is written to disk at authorized shutdown and read+wiped from disk at
startup. Anyhow, these two (or three) values are XORed together to form the key used to
encrypt the volume. When your adversaries, armed with their trusty rubber
hoses, come knocking at and/or down your door, you hit a hotkey to start
destroying those 24 bytes on disk, which can be done faster and more
effectively than a wipe of every sector in the volume. The folks with the
rubber hoses are now, assuming this is their first peek at your disk, screwed; even with your passphrase, they don't know a thing about your data.

@_subject: Re: Predicting cipher life / NSA rigged DES? / Destroying encrypted data (Tangent to Re: Burning papers) 
Yes, I think that's what my (inaccurate) model would suggest you do, if my
guesses as to break probability are close; real, practical cipher breaks get
rarer after more analysis-hours pass -- i.e., ciphers are more likely to be
broken in the first year of analysis than the tenth -- so expected lifetimes
would increase with the amount of analysis survived.
Of course, like TcM said, chaining ciphers only cuts speed by a little and
helps security a lot.
That shouldn't surprise anyone who's seen my posts. :)
Perhaps I should say that the S-boxes weren't as secure as they could/should
have been. We know how to construct better ones now (s^5 DES is just that --
DES w/better [?] S-boxes), and I'd venture to say that if NSA wasn't 21 years
ahead, they either spent most of their cash on computers, not crypto whizzes,
or else the cryptographers spent too much time on coffee breaks...
As to their knowledge of linear attacks back then, the same thing applies; although we have no solid evidence, assuming they were up to today's level of
analysis is not exactly going out on a limb. Now, this *is* going out on a limb (while contradicting my original statement
:), but there's always the possibility that those S-boxes *were* as good as
they could have been for 16 rounds, and there was an even more vile attack
against DES with S-boxes which we think are more secure.
