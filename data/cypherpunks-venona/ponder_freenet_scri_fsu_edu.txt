From the July 11 _Fortune_ magazine, in an article about "25 cool companies":
     The battle over how to ensure the privacy and security of
     communication in cyberspace pits the spy masters at the National
     Security Agency, with thousands of people and a budget said to be in

     California company.  Nearly everyone in Silicon Valley seems to be

     because it sells a way to keep digital exchanges indecipherable by
     unwanted eyes, including those of Big Brother.

Multiple authors, the RSA piece was by Alan Deutschman (deutschman
Interesting blurb, two quotes from Jim  The article also covers Mosaic
Communications, Enterprise Integration Technologies, McAfee Assoc., Cisco
Systems, Infosafe, Scientific Computing Assoc., Security Dynamics, & others.
