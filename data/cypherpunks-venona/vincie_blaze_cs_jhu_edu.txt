@_subject: What kind of encryption to incorporate? 
I'm finishing up on a stegography(sp?) program that uses GIF and WAV
files. It was inspired by Cypherella's Stego program for the Mac.
In the program, I incorporate the filename, length, then data to the
GIF or WAV file. RIght now, I just use a basic secrey key encryption.
It will XOR each data byte with a byte in the password and repeat this.
Is there a better way to encrypt the data that is just has easy to code?
Sorry if this an FAQ. I couldn't find an FAQ for this group. Michael Ko
