Why does this sound so much like defining the problem away?
Maybe I just don't get it...

But (amusingly enough) they can get free testing services from this
aspiring student for free just by providing source code.  Hey, it's fun! :-)
I'm no expert, but you get what you pay for. [Psst: anyone wanna offer source code to the security modules?]
I do think their ``bug bounty'' system is an improvement -- at least
they're showing some concern for security, and beginning to admit
that outside review of security-critical code is...well...critical.
Still, I do agree that they really oughta be employing true experts
to carefully evaluate their system, if they wanna claim anything about
its security.

No, here I think Dr. Cohen's comments are right on the mark.
The Java interpreter *is* supposed to be a trusted computing base.
Do we have any reason to believe that this trust is well-placed?
(If you don't agree, go through the Orange Book evaluation criteria,
and pay special attention to the assurance sections...)

But before everyone pats themselves on the back, congratulating themselves
on how hard an active attack is to set up, look at
Yes, folks, a commercial program which mounts an active attack.
(Check out the GUI!  Click on the `Watch Mail' control!  Activate the
`Take over' button!  Whee, mom, hacking is fun!)
Active attacks may not be trivial, but they aren't exactly rocket science,
either -- and they're for sale.
