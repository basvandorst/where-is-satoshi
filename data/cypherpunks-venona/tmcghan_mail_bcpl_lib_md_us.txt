As a marylander, in particular, a baltimoron, I am both embarrassed
and annoyed that these legislative bozos have the unmitigated gall
to expend time and energy on pursuits such as these.  Perhaps they
feel that our state attorney general needs to earn his excessive
salary by attempting to defend this constitutionally indefensible
mental excrement.  Did the defeat of CDA not resonate?

Information Warfare Conference
sponsored by DPMA/AITP
Washington, DC, March 13-14, 1997
Crystal City Marriott
1999 Jefferson Davis Highway
Arlington, VA  22202
Presentations by:
Major General Michael V. Hayden, Commander, Air Intelligence Agency
Dr. C. Kenneth Allard, Competitive Strategies
Col. H. Stevens, Land Information Warfare Activity
- current service visions and planned program initiatives
- operational concepts for 'third-wave' warfare
- information warfare drivers for 21st century C4I architectures
- emerging technologies and systems for information warfare superiority: opportunities on the horizon
'information warfare targets and vulnerabilities', Maxim I. Kovel,
 TASC systems management group
'information warfare for deterrence', William H.J. Manthorpe, Jr.
Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins
'adaptive techniques for counter-deception', James Llinas,
technical advisor, DOD JDL, Data Fusion group
'emerging threats come in all sizes and flavors', Eugene Schultz, SRI
"Information has been termed the 'fifth dimension' in the conduct of 'third-wave' warfare, and promises to dramatically enhance the role of C4I as a force multiplier.  Joint and individual service doctrine is emerging for IW, ans is affecting the needs and requirements for diverse systems:  from space-based surveillance and communications systems to terrestrial image processing, visualization, and information fusion systems."
"This conference will provide a valuable forum where military and industry staff can interact with key decision-makers to achieve the most current possible understanding of Information Warfare concepts, initiatives, technologies and potential opportunities.  The Critical Questions to be addressed include:
- how is IW changing operational concepts?
- how can we defend the weak links in the planned information-intensive reconnaissance, strike, targeting architecture?
- what developments in enabling technologies are needed to support current Information Operations, Battlefield Visualization, and Information Exploitation initiatives?
-what can be done to develop defensive information technology             and last, but _c_e_r_t_a_i_n_l_y_ not least:
- how will we move forward to develop a true offensive IW capability

these words appeared:
I would expect that "John's involvement" will not be lost just because the
primary mass storage for the data comprising these messages is not on a
disk drive in toad hall.  Unless the openness of this list, which was such a cause celebre, is compromised, I do not envision any mechanisms being put in place to exclude his contributions, if he chooses to make any.
I also expect that the outcome of the in-progress election for ISOC board of trustees may have a certain effect on his time-and-energy resource allocation algorithm for the next few years.
