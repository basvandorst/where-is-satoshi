@_subject: Re: Are there enough FBI agents to handle Digital Telephony????? 
There is and probably never will be a shortage of people to carry on wire tapping . The term agent could be all encompassing in the future to include but not be limited to the hiring of ex-federally employed personnel with the talents or capacity for the talent to do wiretapping. In other words there are any number of ex-CIA ,DEA, ex-military who if were hired would actually save the government investigation time and costs because they have allready gone through security clearance. Add to that the fact that most if not all FBI personnel have gone through a light wiretap course to famililarize them with the rudiments of the craft.
   All these figures add up to cover the taps in case a disaster of the terroristic kind should happen. I feel that numbers are there to worry people but that what the FBI is worrying about is whether it can cover large ground if there is a siege like state in this country.HOWEVER, there will allways be those that opportunistically take advantage of circumstances to set up their own invisible little feifdoms along the political and social terrain.    If you ask me if there is something for them to worry about I have to in all good conscience say yes , if you ask if there is something for us to worry about again I have to say yes. I don't know if there is even a common ground for both sides to work towards because terrorism has grown to include the homegrown variety .

Hi guys,
    Long time no post. Credit card numbers are determined by algorithmns.If s credit card number is no fitting to that algorithmn it is phoney. The only way that I know of to determine the validity of the card if a person has a copy of underground algorithmn generating software is to use the voice number and a store acct # for a purchase of say $50.00 or to go through the credit bureau.What I have wondered is if there is a way to determine a experation date from the credit card number.

    Tim,
      I m not getting the mailing list for cypherpunks . This is the second no third time that I know about where entire lists have disappearedon me. One was religoius , but I wrote that off as them not liking my handle. Then I got a notice from the nueron digest that my mail was bouncing back to them and that they were cancelling my sub. That was ok too as I wasn't THAT interested in them .Now my beloved Cypherpunks is not being deliverd to my door(computer)and that hurt (even with the flaming and noise). Have I been left off because I get too much mail to my provider?Is it because I have recently only lurked and added nothing of worth? Anything else?                         Thanks in Advance

          You should stick to your own religion and not criticize other peoples. It is unforunate that the esteem that I once felt for you is dwindling because of your anti-Mormon trash. Perhaps you do not realise that some people take more than an academic interest in their religion ;this is unforunate .

@_subject: Re: Can't block caller ID in Massachusetts? 
The reason that caller ID cannot be blocked to 800 and 900 numbers is that it is used for billing purposes by the telephone company to the person or business who owns that 900 or 800 number. EX:  L.L.Bean ( alarge mailorder sporting goods store in Freeport,Maine) gets thousands of calls from their clientele around the country.The 800s because they are not charged to the person calling the L.L.Bean must be charged to someone to pay the expenses of running the telephone equiptment and the profits going to the stckholders so who pays ? The businesses pay. A way must be found to figure out what they owe and the only way to do that is to keep records. They records as they stand now include the phone number from which they were dialed and the length of the call. My phone call to them from Scranton ,Pa will cost the L.L.Bean less then Tim Mays from California because I am closer. That is unless I perhaps have a package missing and need to stay on the customer service line for twenty minutes or longer when he just placed an order and got off in under five.
     THe phone company looks at the L.L.Bean phone records and send them a bill that includes how much it cost me to make that phone call to them to find out if the package got lost and Tim's to order that wheelbarrow and all the other callers. Each caller will have cost the L.L.Bean a different amount of money. The telephone number on the reords. It can be used to track down teenage hackers who want to upgrade their disk drives(Bean has none) and other stuff too dependent upon the size of the company (not Bean)and the integrity of the employees. It could conceivably be used by an unscrupulous employee from Sadie's S and M to blackmail someone or the whole clientele list. This is unforunate.
      What could concevably be done is that the software could be reprogrammed to delete the phone number immediatley after the computation. Or to have the computation done immediately and deltion to accompany it. third, the phone company could reprogram it so the mileage and time is computed somhow without the logging of the caller. All of this has to do computer programming and I find none of the aforementioned an impossibility to achieve.

Dale I wouldn't worry about the mountain and what is under it. It is
only genealogical stuff. Salt lake has to wait 100 years or 99 (i Forget)
in order to be able to make the records public. The SSA makes death info
available as soon as the body is cold. And that is on cd rom. Most banks
have contingency plans for having intact records in case of nuclear or
civil disturbance. Again it is under the mountains .    As for costs ,the full amount of the custodial costs are born by
members. Originally it was by donations of money and I think now it is
taken from the tithe. That is a sum in excess of 1 billion dollars by the
members.

the event of a nuclear devastation the church could paste things together
again. People can submit whatever they wnat to the records including wills
and trusts and stuff ,but that has nothing to do with the gentile
community at large . i can only think of the microfilms containing a

@_subject: Re: Legality of requiring credit cards? 
I am glad that someone has raised this issue. Two things for myself.
Years ago I had both a checking account and a Visa card. i did not want
the interest on my Visa so I asked the clerk at Lechter's to take my check
with the drivers licensce and they said I had to show a credit card. Then
the bitch wrote my whole life's hiustory on the check. The dirver's
licensce number, my home phone number , other stuff and all the
information contained on the credit card(incidentally some inluding I
think Lechter's want at least 6 months left on the card.), I hit the roof
. They had enough information for anyone of the dozens of bank,store or
business people to really do a job on my life. I just walked out . Then
they refused me another time because there wasn't enough months left and
eventually wouldn't let me use the card at all because it had
expired(though I and my ID hadn't).
     Scenario number two was recently at the Software Etc store in
Scranton ,Pa where much to my consternation I found that the store had
written my date of birth on the check. And there is a cute younger guy
there that I like to talk shop to. SHIT.).I think that this stuff has
really gotten out of hand.      Maybe , the answer to all our problems is to draft a privacy bill in
varous forms and stages and each member of the list submit it to his or
her representative,congressman or senator. That is something that can
legally be done and it is practical. I say stages because what we want
will never pass the first time in its  entirety BUT we could conceiveably
get something started.
      Anybody interested email me personally as I am willing and albe to
do a share of the work.
