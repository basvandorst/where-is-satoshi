MIT is one the best schools in the country for C.S.
        Close behind is Carnegie Mellon University (C.M.U.) in Pittsburgh,
PA. (the folks who put out CERT.) Not sure how much Crypto they do, though.

I think there's one class on crypto (explicitly), but there's some
talent here. One who was interested could get an independant study or
a research job without too much trouble. After all, MIT isn't the only
place that writes kerberos, AFS, and the like.
(In case you're wondering, the "A" in AFS stands for "Andrew," of
Andrew Carnegie.)
