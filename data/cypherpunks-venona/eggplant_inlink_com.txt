@_subject: Re: Truelly Random Numbers 
Actually, I remember reading somewhere,  a long time ago though, that the
NSA had come up with an almost undoubtably random sequence by using random
high altitude RF signals, scanning a certain frequency I guess. Then using
it as the random number.
Given the amount of RF transmisions world-wide and the addition of
high-altitude interference, it should be completely random. Unless someone
were to get their hands on you copy of it or happened to be hooked up to
your reciever at the time of recording, there is no way they could figure
it out.

I'm lookig for people who live in the St. Louis area who are interested in

How about...only paying for the initial investment of the phone program and
hardware. No more costs to pay, get rid of long distance charges
all-togther. Except for the ISP charge of course. And how about the ISP's
setting up a special account for people only needing the Iphone. That way
all the revnue that generates (well most of it) can go to increasing the
bandwith. Increased bandwith (fibre?) is the key factor here, both your
scenario and mine. Also, what companies want to invest in a dedicated
internet phone?
How about a combination...all-in-one web browsing (that's what many people
will wnt in the future for sure), internet phone and CD-ROM playing system.
That way people who don't want a full-scale computer can get something
cheaper than a computer that will do all they need it to do. Of course the
system should allow for email (including PGP, etc) and some text editing.
Just a thought....

One thing to remember, this is still a developing program. With the
increasing of bandwith and the development of new and better compression
algorithyms, this will slowly fade. This is only the begining. In a couple
years, the transmision and reception could be as good, if not better than
the normal telephone, you never know.
