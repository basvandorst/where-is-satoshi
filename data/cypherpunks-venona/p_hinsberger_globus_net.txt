@_subject: IP-Adresses 
my English is fuck, but I hope that anybody unerstand me If I`ve got a IP-Adress, f.E. 126.0.202.146 and our proxy denies this
Adress, I can transform this adress in one number...
((126*256)+0)*256+202)*256+146 = 7E 00 CA 92
Is there a mistake?
Can I connect with this adress to a Website? (Netscape Navigator and
Proxy from Bull Systems...)
Please give reply direct to my E-Mail adress, and not to the group...

@_subject: buttsniffer 
Hi folk!
Anybody knows how to use Buttsniffer?
I can listen to ethernet frames in our network, but after a few minutes
I`ve got a huge File with over 50MB...
I read that there is an option to listen only to POP3 password and
so funny things...
At the moment I listen the network with the options :
buttsniff -d 0002 pws.txt e
Please mail me directly!!!
ThanX (and Sorry for my fucKKK English!!!)
