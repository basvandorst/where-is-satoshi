For what it's worth, you can use the mapping software at
 to find your location fairly accurately; you may
need another map to locate yourself, since the streets are unlabeled. I
managed to figure out that I'm currently at latitude 37.3435 degrees,
longitude -121.8925 degrees. I think that's correct to within about 100
feet or so.

I've recently been looking into this as well. I haven't looked at ISODE
yet. Snacc looks reasonable, but can't handle big integers (> 2^32), which
may make it hard to use for certificates, due to embedded RSA keys; I
haven't yet checked to see what could be done about this. It's free; the
compiler is under the GNU license, but the runtime is redistributable
without fee or onerous restriction.
I also spoke to a company in NJ, Open Systems Solutions (609.987.9073), but
their licensing terms were too expensive for my purposes. Their product
runs on a lot of platforms and sounds very complete, but requires a
licensed run-time environment. They currently support C and Pascal; C++ is
coming. Their development environment starts at $11,500.
I'm also searching for an ASN.1 product. We can afford to pay for a
compiler, but we need unrestrained distribution of the runtime in source
form. Any information would be greatly appreciated.

DSS uses SHA, which isn't affected by the Dobbertin finding. I believe that
you would have to solve the discrete logarithm problem to break DSS; this
would imply being able to break Diffie-Hellman and a number of other crypto
algorithms. (However, I'm not certain that it's been shown that breaking
DSS is equivalent to breaking discrete logarithms.)

@_subject: Re: Is Chaum's System Traceable or Untraceable? 
Not that full anonymity isn't a Good Thing, but couldn't this be solved by
having the merchant (who presumably is on-line) provide PDA <-> mint
connectivitiy for the purposes of getting change, exchanging coins, etc.?
My assumption is that all the ecash protocols are not subject to a MITM
attack, which I would just presume to be good practice.
Also, given the fully anonymous protocol as you've described it (both payor
and payee blind the coins), what's to prevent the merchant from depositing
your change before he gives it to you? Unless your PDA is online, you'll be
home before you find out the hot dog vendor shorted you. (It's my
understanding that the current digicash system does not support Chaum's
method of revealing the identity of double-spenders).

The way doubleclick works is that the sites who contract with them to sell
advertising space insert a URL into their page which fetches the
doubleclick ad banner. For example, the guys at TroutHeads, Inc.
( would insert an HTML IMAGE tag with an HREF referring
to ad.doubleclick.net; that then results in _your_ browser doing an HTTP
transaction with ad.doubleclick.net; doubleclick can then hand you all the
cookies it wants.
Anytime you fetch an image, you're visiting a site, and because it's
automatic, you can easily visit a lot of sites you never knew you were
going to.
For any HTML document you wish to display an ad banner for, simply add the
     HTML tags:

     Where MY_URL is the URL for the HTML document displaying the ad banner. For
