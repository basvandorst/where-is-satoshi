@_subject: Secrets (was:Is there a lawyer in the house?) 
There seems to be some confusion about what the law of the land considers
a "secret." Secrets according to our laws are knowledge one doesn not share
without a BINDING legal obligation to keep the secret.    Remember R4.C? That was a secret until it was shared, and hence lost its
privileged position as a "Trade secret."    Your secret key is just as safe, so long as it is always kept out of
anyone else's hands. However if you are going to provide it to someone else
it should be only through some form of contract. Even this might not be
sufficient in some circumstances. The only truly safe possibility would be
giving it to your lawyer in the course of your lawyers representation of
you. NOTE: NOT YOUR COMPANY'S LAWYER. In house council have their obligation
to the company, not to you. As such if they felt your key was unrelated to
company business interests and possibly adverse to the company's
interest...kiss that secret good bye.    Sure, the police still need a warrant to go into your house and get the
key, but they do NOT need a warrant to ask anyone else for your key, if you
revealed your secret to someone who does not have an obligation of
confidentiality to you, then they can reveal it with impunity. The danger of
revealing it to a nonlawyer who has a contract with you is that they can be
forced to reveal it, and still be liable to you for breech of contract...
   I am sure you see the dangers...just say no to key escrow...much safer.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   I hope that his code was not stolen, if it was actually stolen and then
released and we knew that for sure, then trade secret rights would probably
still apply. However the code was posted anonymously we do NOT know for
certain that it was MISAPPROPRIATED. As such it may have been reverse
engineered in manner that does not violate trade secrets and hence it can be
used. The burden is with RSA to prove that any one person KNEW it was
misappropriated. That is why we are seeing all these messages flying around
on the web, RSA attorneys are trying to shut the barn door after the horses
have left...
a rushed,

Although it has not been completely settled that disassembly is a
legitimate form of reverse engineering, the trend has been to consider the
two equivalent. So, whoever posted RC2 had at least a good idea of how to
present it.    I don't think it would be be a good idea for them to come out and sue RSA
for libel for the accusation that it was misappropriated however.

I am not an electrical engineer and do not play one in real life. However in

Better to get TEMPEST rated hardware then... check government surplus...

True, however the number of questions asked by El Al decreases amazingly
when you answer in Hebrew, however that did not stop me being addressed by
five security personnel after a trip where had been doing a photo
documentary and was still wearing a photo vest full of black metal
cannisters (lenses). Of course when the security head finally approached me
I used Hebrew and that was then end of the episode. Unfortunately speaking
English is not a very good determination of airline safety.

Did you look at getting an anonymous account at cyberpass.net? Try Note, they tend to be strict about not using it for illegal activity, but
highly supportive for general anonymous use.
Then again you could set up some type of applet scheme, but I doubt anyone
would be willing to keep it active.
