I'll escrow my key with David, encrypt yours with it then
print it out and store it in a secure filing cabinet in the
salt mines near detroit.
I'll need to charge $3.00 per key, overhead you know.

@_subject: How to launder money (internationally) (fwd) 
How dirty drug money is laundered internationally:
[From National Geographic, Vol.183, No.1 Jan.1993, pg105]
Titled: The Power of Money, by Peter T White, Asst. Editor,
quoting his sources as the "Centre for International
Documentation of Organized and Economic Crime, located
in Cambridge, England.
[begin this section]
This as a real-life example:
A U.S. organized crime group with a lot of hot cash forms a cozy
relationship with the central bank of a British Commonwealth
country.  Diplomats of that country carry the cash out of the
U.S.  If it's $10,000 or more, they are supposed to report that
to U.S. Customs, but they don't; they "externalize" the cash.
It goes into the central bank and then into various dummy companies
in different countries in return for shares in those companies.
The money is thus "agitated," so it'll be just about impossible for
investigators to follow.  Then, to "repatriate" the money, dummy
companies in the U.S. sell their worthless shares to investors in
Britain - who are in fact in on the scam - and behold, the money
is back in the U.S., clean!  Now it buys legitimate businesses,
banks, political power.
An operation like this, involving highly placed officials, and
businessmen, will cost quite a bit, maybe 35 percent, but once
the system is in place, people will want to use it - not only
drug profiteers but also arms dealers, terrorist organizations,
intelligence agencies...
A prime haven for such shady customers was BCCI, the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, headquartered in Luxembourg
and the Cayman Islands with branches in 72 countries.  It is said
to have secretly controlled the First American Bank of Washington, D.C.
After BCCI collapsed in 1991, having defrauded depositors of several
billion dollars, it became known as the Bank of Crooks and
Criminal International.
[End, this section]
Can you say Mena - Clinton - Whitewater, 3 times real fast?!?
In the very next section, there is an interesting little number
used by the bank/finance crowds, it's number "72".
[begin this section]
- the rule of 72.  No one is certain who first developed the rule,
but the principle is quite simple:  Divide any number into 72  and
the answer tells how long it will take for a sum to double in
financial terms.
Are you charged 18 percent interest on the unpaid balance of your
credit card account?  Eighteen goes into 72 four times - so the
debt would double in four years.  Say your annual raise is 6
percent; that number goes into 72 twelve times, so in twelve
years your salary will double.  The same holds true of any
investment.  And what if inflation runs at 6 percent a year?
Then after a dozen years your money will be worth half as much,
so in a sense you'll be back where you started.
[end this section]
Gee, now I wonder if the money-changers figured this into
setting annual inflation rates!  Kind of keeps the middle
class down, and stuck in a rut.

Well, there is selective wording, mispellings, punctuation and
formatting. These can be corrected easily if allowed to be
transported as a text or common file type.
Another  way is to place the document in a PItA proprietary graphical
format for transport and viewing only, stego identifier imbedded if
you chose * , so that every portion of the document has some
indentifier imbedded in it. Many obvious and many devious. Electronic
drawings with a harmless and useless circuit(s) added on , software
with do nothing code (by design!:) ).  Difficult and time consuming
to do, but for megabuck items, no prob. Automated for an additional
fee of course. Start a service industry for such, make money, pay me
back by running a fast, reliable remailer.
Idea is to make the thief go to some major effort and if the scanning
option is used to make the deletions  as obvious and telling as the
former identifier.
note* Makes a neat way of putting copyright & source  information in picture and sound files, somewhat useless but every trip up helps.

To whom it may concern:
This fellows proposed  actions are those of a blind fool who cannot

He sees foreign immigrants, legal or illegal, as being a problem.
The problem he is seeing is not any problem created by the immigrants
who are looking for something better, but one created for the very
purpose of distracting such fools as him from the underlying problems
his state this Nation faces. He has bought the lie spewed by the talking heads and other
psycological operations that have told him to think the 'illegals'
are causing some sort of problem.
Prop 187 and such proposals are nothing more than a method to have implemented systems and plans, not to correct the alledged problem, but to implement an underlying plan that was the desired goal from the start; namely a national ID and tracking system.
This is a typical tactic, race against race, religion against
religion, etc. all to divide us into small, blind, ineffective,
bickering groups who have little voice and no cohesive political
If his actions do not accelerate what is already occuring then the real enemy is alseep, as it is a wonderful opportunity for further psycological operations that will benefit them in numerous ways.

This states that some  anonymous remailers are run by various gov't and that encryption keys up to 1000 bits are crackable.
Whether this is true or disinformation, you are using a 1024 bit key
and all your messages through anonymous remailers are encrypted
aren't they?
Also note that while later versions of PGP are capable of larger keys, that these versions of PGP are not known to be secure. PGP 2.3a is the last version released prior to gov't interference.
PGP 2.3a will do 1264 bit keys if you enter 1264 in the box instead of the number it askes for when if asks for the type of key security you want.

Rescinding your social security number is another thing that I would have
said a year ago, "OK, it's an option, but it's a grandstanding option.
It's waving and saying, 'Hey, hey, I'm a troublemaker. Put me on a list.'" But
I am going to be rescinding my social security number formally, writing to the
Social Security Administration and saying, "Nope. Not my number, folks." It may
be a grandstanding gesture, but that number is a slave's number, and I'm
getting rid of it, pure and simple.
Now a lot of people -- a lot of people _here_ -- are doing these things
already. I know people right here in this group who haven't paid taxes in
years. I know people in this group who don't have a driver's license, who
_have_ rescinded their social security numbers, or whatever, and I think
that's great.
In fact Rick White came up with a really good term the other day when we
were talking. He talked about "individual secession" as a means of
combating the government. We were talking about ways of avoiding violence, and
he suggested "individual secession" as a means of accomplishing that. I think
it's great, and I think we all need to do it.
But I also think that the result of quiet secession -- of just quietly
withdrawing your consent, your support, your participation in the system
