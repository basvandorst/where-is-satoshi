A kind of Cybermilitia! Can we still wear green uniforms and camouflage face

I wouldn't be too disappointed with a hole in BIOS password security. Most
of them can be easily defeated by a jumper switch, or shorting a pin on the
system board.

< whole bunch of stuff >  Wow, I'm going to miss cypherpunks. I didn't post much, but I've always

Oh, by the way, since you're planning on doing away with things, could you get rid of some of these outfits that do the mass e-mails, thanks in advance.
I find you're martial arts reference very interesting. But if you were truly
any good, you wouldn't be waving it in everyones face like a banner. I find
your demeanor to be that of someone that has never practiced the warrior
arts. If you had, you'd have developed more respect for your fellow human
beings.         I'm guessing you're a very lonely person, whos only way of getting
attention is to try and cause a conflict. Share your pain with us, and
together we'll grow stronger ( Star Trek reference ;)). But if you can't do
that, shut off your computer ( or leave your terminal), and go find someone to talk to,
like a counselor. Eric Wilson

The Monkey virus ( I'm not sure what the "B" variant has altered ) is a
memory resident, stealth, boot infector that writes ( and encrypts!) the
partition table to side 0, cyl 0, sector 3 of your hard disk. It then
modifies your MBR to point to this location. When the virus is resident it
infects any floppy ( not write protected )that is accessed by the system. If
you need help with cleaning the Monkey from your system, try asking the
geniuses at alt.comp.virus for some help. Keep in mind they argue with each
other more than cypherpunks do! Here's a hint on cleanup, booting clean and
running Fdisk/mbr will remove the virus from your hard disk, but it WILL NOT
restore your partition table!

Yes, lets create polymorphic viruses and CPU cycle stealing Java applets. Maybe even a new and improved Internet worm...

Aw,  surely "Cypher punks" can write some sort of code. Batch files, Macros for Word, programs for  Logo or Turtle graphics, tell me it isn't so!
