Could someone point me to information about the RSA129 factoring project?
I would like the see the programs involved, and learn a little about the
coordinating efforts.

This is generally true of sockets programming.  You don't know that you'll get
as many bytes as you request.  The simplest solution is to loop your read
calls until you get what you need.  See BSD Sockets: A Quick & Dirty Primer
for a sample solution.  The URL is Russell Ross                     email: rross

Here's their reply to a similar correspondence:
I wasn't aware that you could copyright an algorithm.  Patent, yes, but not
copyright.  Intellectual property meens secret, right?  Aren't there any
precendence cases involving propriety schemes that are reverse engineered?
I know there have been, I just can't remember what they are.  In any case,
RSADSI is likely to sue anyone who attempts to use the RC4 code openly, and
even if they lose there are considerable legal fees involved for whoever
tries it.  What if a bunch of people put secure HTTPd servers online at the
same time, without any clear trail pointing to the first one?  If the RC4
code really is legal to use, this would make it hard for RSADSI to pinpoint
anyone to sue, thus eliminating the intimidation factor.
By the way, since RSA is such a vocal opponent of the Clipper chip on the
grounds of its secret Skipjack algorithm, why does it market secret
algorithms like RC4 and RC2?  Does this seen like a double face to anyone

Source code for them is available for $25,000, but only binaries are
available otherwise.  The source code for RC4 was leaked or
reverse-engineered, so it is widely known now, but RSA has never released
the algorithm officially.  I have found no documentation on the algorithm
behind RC2.  They are in fact secret, proprietary algorithms, with the
exception of the unofficial RC4 code.
