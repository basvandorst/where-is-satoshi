Hey, you misinformed Dolt Hallam-Baker, for the record
I voted for Clinton.  I won't for Dole.  Now, back in your cave.

I broke the story about how much Digital Telephony would *really* cost in CyberWire Dispatch more than two years ago.  The price tag in my piece:  "... at least $2 billion..."  In that Dispatch I wrote that the Clinton White House had made the decision to support the bill based on a flawed cost/benefit analysis study the FBI had done.

Just so this isn't hanging in cyberspace forever, my $5,000 bet for anyone to prove the TWA 800 flight was downed by a U.S. missile is now *off the table*.  It's been two-plus weeks since I tossed out the bet and no one took me up on it, so it's now being formally withdrawn.

CyberWire Dispatch // September // Copyright (c) 1996 //
Jacking in from the "Smoked Filled Room" Port:
Washington, DC -- Federal provisions funding the digital telephony bill
and roving wiretaps, surgically removed earlier this year from an
anti-terrorism bill, have quietly been wedged into a $600 billion
omnibus spending bill.
The bill creates a Justice Department "telecommunications carrier
compliance fund" to pay for the provisions called for in the digital
telephony bill, formally known as the Communications Assistance in Law
Enforcement Act (CALEA).  In reality, this is a slush fund.
Congress originally budgeted $500 million for CALEA, far short of the
billions actually needed to build in instant wiretap capabilities into
America's telephone, cable, cellular and PCS networks.  This bill now
approves a slush fund of pooled dollars from the budgets of "any agency"
with "law enforcement, national security or intelligence
responsibilities."  That means the FBI, CIA, NSA and DEA, among others,
will now have a vested interest in how the majority of your
communications are tapped.
The spending bill also provides for "multipoint wiretaps."  This is the
tricked up code phase for what amounts to roving wiretaps.  Where the
FBI can only tap one phone at a time in conjunction with an
investigation, it now wants the ability to "follow" a conversation from
phone to phone; meaning that if your neighbor is under investigation and
happens to use your phone for some reason, your phone gets tapped.    It
also means that the FBI can tap public pay phones... think about that
next time you call 1-800-COLLECT.
In addition, all the public and congressional accountability provisions
for how CALEA money was spent, which were in the original House version
(H.R. 3814), got torpedoed in the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Provisions stripped out by the Senate:

Gore didn't say shit.  Sorry but there is no polite way to say this.  Gore's remarks at the SPA speech were a great example of "state speak" which the State Dept. has perfected, saying much and in "code" through the use of phrasing and even tone.
Gore said the White House couldn't support Freeh's plan... what he meant was "yet" because, in fact, thereis no formal plan to "accept."
But the minute that the House or Senate pass such a proposal out of committee is the minute WhH policy changes.  And I'll be anyone one that... any takers?
Gore is playing word games, practing for the run for the money in 2000.

Don't count on the language being yanked in Judiciary.  The real "only hope" is actually an incredibly low tech and unsexy thing called "time."
The 105th Congress wants to split early, possibly in three weeks!  Yes, three weeks (hard working lot, eh?)  There is no way this bill gets through the Rules committee with multiple versons floating around and then gets brought to the floor for a vote... won't happen.
So that sets up next year....
As for teh "violent split" in the White House, sure there is, but the split is *very deep* as in, deep in the Org chart.  The starting players, save one, are all on board with the FBI plan.  The one courageous main player is a Clinton loyalist until he dies, but Gore can't stand him.  Our main man has the ability to pick up the phone--at any time-- and get Clinton on teh other end.  He whispers intoBill's ear, but Bill is a lame duck and is setting up Gore for the "long run" in 2000.
Nobody wants to look soft on crime, esp. in the ramp up to 2000.
The White House will back this mandatory language, I'll bet on it (really, I'll bet on it, any takers?) the only "game" left here is to figure out how Gore will try and save face by supporting a recanting of his 'no mandatory crypto" stance.

Yeah, well, except that there isn't a year left for this Congress.  If it doesn't get done before the next recess (in which we don't see Congress again until it becomes teh 106th, next year) the slate is wiped clean and we start from ground zero.
