something about this:
population has no clue about how either encryption (well, basic math
for a good chunk :/ )  or software works.  Just heard something on the
radio (Niel Bortz, if you're curious) about how California public schools have started giving credit for wrong answers on MATH tests.
So the students don't _feel bad_ about being wrong.  I want to trust my life to an airplane designed by someone who got the right answers,
not to someone who has artificially induced high self-esteem. Doesn'tWorks has a problem he goes out 9 months later and shells out more $$$ for the next buggy release. Start mentioning 128-bit IDEA, entropy, or pseudo-anything and their eyes may just glaze over.  With
the state of public education, it'll be amazing if Joe Sixpack can figure out that he has to plug in his computer first; nevermind understand why trusting his financial secrets to a secret "proprietary"
encryption scheme that the gubument has the back door to is a bad idea.

PGP and verifies the page and pops up a window with the results.  It would

on cards (Ah, my foolish youth.  Anyone want to buy a slightly used
Chaos Orb? :).
listing of all the cards therin) to the umpire (if you don't want the
even umpire seeing the deck contents until afterwards, make them
submit a bit-committed symetric key and encrypt the deck manifest with
it).  Each individual card in the deck should have a unique identifier
which should be noted on the manifest.  Identifiers wouldn't need to
be sequential (in fact they might leak info to the opponent if they
were), but duplicates of the same card should each have its own id.
Depending on how you want to run things, you could allow (and probably
should require) players to submit new a ID->card list before each
round begins.
ID	Card
309487	Prodigal Sorcerer
008461	Land (Plains)
663542	Land (Forrest)
Whenever a player needs to "draw", the other player takes an ID at
random off the list of IDs (and marks is as "used").  At the end of
each round the players submit a transcript of the game to the umpire
who then checks that all the cards played were in the decks, that no
duplicates of the same id/card were used, or changes of cards (i.e. ID
440315 was supposed to be a "Zombie" but the owning player said it was
a "Yawgmoth's Daemon").
between two people), have opponents swap the encrypted deck manifest
and bit commit to key used.  Afterwards they can double check for
cheating themselves.  Something you might want to allow is letting a
player include extra IDs which map to "no card, pick again".  This
would allow players to disguise the exact size of their deck (although
this would only allow for puffing up a deck, not making it appear
certificates (something along the lines of "card name & serial number"
signed by the owner, then by the issuer).  This would make trading a
bit of a problem as you couldn't give the card away without the issuer
(Online clearing for Magic cards? :).  And there's the problem of how
do you tell who actually owns the card (if the issuer keeps a list of
serial number->owners that might work, but again that needs online
clearing).  I missed all the discussion on digital bearer bonds a
while back, but something like that might could be applied here.
I can think of at this late hour and I'm sure someone will shoot holes
all through it anyhow. :) What do you think, sirs?

and wound up watching a panel on CSPAN from the World Economic Forum
on "Technology & Security".  The pannelists were Nicholas Negroponte
from MIT's Media Lab, John Barlow from the EFF, a Mike Nelson from the
White House (no relation to MST3K's :), and two other people whom I
can't for the life of me remember their names (one was from a security
consulting firm, and the other was a lawyer from something like the
"Bristol Group").  It was 3am, so sue me. :)
administration encryption policy bashing from all sides.  Nelson kept
saying that the administration wanted to support "good strong
encryption" and they wanted to be able to say (paraphrasing) "We think
this is good.  Use this."  (Trust us, we're from a TLA. :) He also
kept saying that (again, paraphrasing) "most encryption out there is
no good".  Which begs the question then why are they wanting to ban
its use and export.  Negroponte kept bringing up the point that their
policy was based on the (flawed, as we all believe) assumption that no
one outside the US could create good crypto.
rights and e$.  It was interesting that the lawyer person agreed to a
good extent with a lot of the remarks Barlow made.  Overall it was
pretty interesting (and not just to watch the White House guy squirm
as his premises were invalidated out from under him :).  CSPAN
usually replays stuff like this at odd times during the weekend so
you might want to keep your eyes peeled.

"personal number" that is my voice, fax, pager, and voice mail.  If someone calls it, it asks them to wait while it locates me.  It then has
a list of numbers it calls to try and find me (desk at work, cell phone,
home phone after 5pm or weekends).  When I answer it tells me who's on
the phone, and if I don't want to talk to them I just hit a key and throw

it's because of problems with the way the cellular network does billing
