I saw a copy of _True Names_ in a local bookstore recently, so if you check around you may be able to find it.  You may also want to check the used bookstores in your area.
Good luck!

Most LEC's charge per-minute for ISDN.  Pac Bell and SWBT are some of the few exceptions.  What's even worse is in some states there isn't even a residential ISDN tariff, hence all ISDN lines are "business" lines and billed accordingly.  The only real solution is to demand dial the connection from both ends.  This is fairly straightforward assuming your provider is set up for it, since there is a lot of ISDN equipment that will brfing the connection up only when there are packets to send then idle it out.
An economical alternative in some areas is frame-relay.  In Washington state USwest wants ~$70/month for a 56k FR link to anywhere in your LATA.  The providers around here charge $100-$150 to link a single machine to the net via FR, and $150-$350 if you are routing a whole

The celluar companies "solution" to this problem for AMPS phones is My understanding is CDMA based digital celluar go a long way toward this.  CDMA uses direct-sequence spread-spectrum based transmission, should keep everyone but the TLA's out.
Consider getting digital celluar service.  The current widely deployed digital celluar standard, TDMA, is less secure than CDMA above, but is more than enough to keep 99% of the cell bandits out.  CDMA should be available from USwest and Pacific Telesis (possibly others) by the end of the year.

Yea, like the UNIX-HATERS mailing list, or the appropriate comp.*.advocacy group.
I read this list to hear about *cypherpunks*, and while it is true that a good cypherpunk will write code, he/she should do so under the OS of his/her choice and not engage in OS holy wars.  There need to be good cypherpunk tools for *ALL* operating systems/enviroments, flaming people over their operating system is not a good way to accomplish this.
