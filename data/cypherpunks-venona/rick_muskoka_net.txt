Okay, I admit it I don't know everything.
What does the perl script actually do.
I saved to file, chmod 777 perly
tried running the script and kept getting error line 3.
What does it do, does it encrypt a file or what. What Have i done wrong?
Please report any Strange behaviour by the Mail Monster to rick
