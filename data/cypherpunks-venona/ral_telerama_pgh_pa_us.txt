@_subject: PGP help? 
I am in search of any MSDos (or Windows, but not preferred) offline mail
readers, text editors, etc. that work well with PGP-- anything to help me
use PGP for everyday email.  I use a dial-up internet connection, so i
have no choice but to use the remote system's PINE mail reader... if
anyone knows of anything that will let me compose and encrypt email
locally and format the messages into a .QWK packet for upload, that would
be IDEAL, but anything else could still help.
(BTW-- i have already posted on alt.security.pgp and nothing ever came of
it. So it goes.)

@_subject: Re:PGP again. 
I apologize for this, but...
If anyone sent me a response re:pgp help, i just lost my incoming mailbox
before i read my mail.  I did see a few responses listed in my new mail,
but they were gone when i tried to read them.  Sorry for the hassle, but
could anyone who did send me something re-send it?  I am not too happy
about all my lost mail.

@_subject: Need help with remailer scripts 
Would someone be able to help me install the remailer scripts from the
archives?  I have no Unix experience and have *no* idea where to begin.  I
don't even know if root access is needed for these.  Any help would be

@_subject: PGP for 4.3 BSD Unix 
I want to install PGP 2.2 in my Unix account, and may need some
assistance.  I have never needed to compile anything before, and need
some guidance.  Actually, if someone has an executable for 4.3 BSD, that
is all i really need.  Otherwise, would anyone care to help?
I really don't know what other info i need to provide to make this
easier... i did see in the makefile.unx that there was a target for BSD
with gcc; gcc -v here shows that version 2.3.3 is here.  Email me if
anyone can help.
Thanks,  bob
BTW- Thanks to Eric Hughes for helping me install some stuff.  It seems
like cypherpunks is a list where people don't only talk, they actually
accomplish something, thanks to people like Eric.

@_subject: RE:CERT 
Not having heard of CERT before, and living ten minutes away from their
offices at SEI, i checked out their anonymous ftp site (cert.org) and
found the CERT faq in the pub directory.  From the info THEY provide, it
seems like a worthwhile organization.  BUT, in their info, they deal with
security issues, not copyright infringement.  I realise that hidden
directories in an incoming dir is a security issue, but it seems to be a
thinly veiled attack on the distribution of software of illegal or
questionable origins.  They do publish security advisories; i would be
interested in seeing a list of sites served with notices similar to those
julf and soda received. Does anyone have more info on CERT? BTW-  SEI at CMU is a scary place.  The photo lab i worked for as a
messenger had clients there, so i was in the building a couple times a day
for more than i year.  Because of their DOD affiliation, there are regular
protests outside the building.  On a normal delivery during one of these
protests i was surrounded by guards, searched, and asked some WAY paranoid
questions even though the regular guards knew who i was.  If you ever
happen to be walking the halls of SEI and see the nice big prints of
guided missiles and other scary stuff,  I probably delivered them.
