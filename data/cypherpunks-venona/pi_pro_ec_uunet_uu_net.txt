Uhhh?   Hello in there...?  Are you a person or some persons?  :>
I'm trying to get my hands on some encryption algorithms, and understand
that this is the place to visit.  Can you (or one of you) advise me?
  I would very much appreciate it.

Many thanks to, Nick Szabo, Bill Stewart, Eric Hughes, &, Matthew Ghio, for
detailed assistance.
This stuff has really captured my imagination. I'll do the right thing and
evesdrop for a while, but you seem like mighty friendly folk and I look
forward to a chat.

Part of the reason I have subscribed to this list is to find out more about
the interelationships possible between barter systems and e-money.
As newbie to the list I don't want to bore anyone with well known facts
Does anyone have detailed knowledge of the works of Silvio Gesell, for
example?  (He was a prominent theoretician of barter systems at the turn of
the century.)
Can anyone tell me how I can get my hands on a copy of the LET system
version of the board game "Monopoly"?
