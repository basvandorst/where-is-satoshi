Kay Ping wrote on 1998-01-16 22:02 UTC:
Actually, this is only true for extremely carefully shielded military
receivers and not for normal radios. Every receiver contains a local
oscillator to bring the signal down to intermediate frequency (IF), which
is emitting EM waves itself. In addition, the IF signal is emitted
as well.
As Peter Wright reported in his autobiography, British counterintelligence
(MI5) used vans and planes already in the 1950s to detect spys while
they received radio communication messages from Moscow and to protocol,
which frequency bands the embassies were monitoring (operation RAFTER).
Efficient receiver detection is an active process: You send out short
bursts of a wideband jamming signal and try to find the downtransformed
intermediate frequency equivalent of your burst in the compromising
emanations of the receiver. This way, you get not only the location of
the receiver, but also the precise frequency to which it is tuned.
Locating radio receivers within a radius of many hundred meters this way
was already state of the art in the spook community over 40 years ago,
so you can safely assume that with digital signal processing, the
performance parameters of modern systems have been increased
significantly. Sending out spread-spectrum style pseudo-noise signals
in the active probing bursts could give you in modern receiver detectors
a considerable signal gain.

The software that displays the license number plus activation instance
random code in your windows toolbar as an easy receivable spread
spectrum barcode would have to take care of this depending on how
exactly your license agreement is formulated. This can be resolved
in many ways.
The technique of hunting software license violators via Tempest
monitoring is not really targeted at providing 100% accurate
and reliable identification of abuse at any point of time as
you seem to imply. Nor is it alone an effective tool of proofing
abuse. It is more an additional tool in getting an initial hint
that a company is violating a software license at large scale
(e.g., has bought a single copy of an expensive CAD software but
uses it on over 80 workstations all day long), which then can
justify to get court relevant proof by traditional means of
police investigation.
One obvious countermeasure are Tempest shielded computers or rooms,
but these are rather expensive, inconvenient and not always reliable.
Another countermeasure are software reverse-engineering and modifying
the broadcast code. This is around as difficult as removing dongle
checking code: Not impossible, but for the majority of users too
Oh, yes, beautifully! Ross' TFT laptop radiates better
than the CRT on my desk here. It is true that LCD displays do not have
the <400 kHz signals caused by the deflection coils that are of concern
for the TCO/MPR low-radiation standards. But they radiate as well in the
broadcasted as harmonics of for instance the dot clock rate.
LCDs are connected to high-speed drivers with sharp edges and lot's
of nice harmonics.
One more remark: This was so far unfunded research initiated by
our private interest in the subject of compromising radiation. In
this field, the available research literature is very close to zero
(there are the van-Eck/Moeller/Smulder papers and that's it basically), and
all the real knowledge is tightly guarded by the military and diplomatic
community. We hope that developing commercial applications for
compromising radiation will open the way to non-military funding
and open research in this field. Copyright protections seems to be
an interesting application. Tempest research requires some
expensive equipment (special antennas, very high-speed DSP
experimental systems, an absorber room, etc.). If Microsoft or
someone else would like to make some Tempest funding available, I think
this should be highly welcome if the results are going to be published
in the open literature. There is no good reason, why knowledge about
compromising emanations should be restricted to the military
community in a time where industrial espionage with these techniques
is probably a larger threat to economies than the results of foreign
intelligence operations.
The preprint of our first paper on this is now on my home page.

You have to differentiate between information carrying emanations
and non-information carrying ones. The horizontal and vertical
deflection coils produce a lot of radiation at harmonics of the
line and frame rate of your CRT, but this signal energy is not
related to your screen content (only to your video mode), and therefore
not of much concern for the eavesdropper. The low-radion monitor
standards look only at those signal (<400 kHz). Therefore having
a TCO92 monitor provides you absolutely no advantage with respect
to eavesdropping.
The information carrying signals of VDUs are in much higher frequency
ranges in the VHF/UHF bands. Laptops are pretty good broadcasters
there, too.

I suspect that FCC material is not helpful with regard to Tempest.
Results of such EMI tests only measure the general power spectrum
emitted by a device. Of interest for Tempest purposes however is
not the power spectrum, but the spectrum of the cross-correlation
between an internal signal-of-interest in the device and the
emanated radiation. There are special cross-correlation meters
available to measure this, but this is not the equipment used in
EMI tests. I have here two patents filed by the German equivalent
of the NSA, that describes cross-correlation techniques for the
"detection of highly distorted digital signals". Measurement equipment
along those lines are what you need in order to estimate the
information carrying components of the emanated spectrum.
You can do cross-correlation not only between the VGA cable output
and the signal picked up by an antenna or a power/ground line tap,
but also between internal bus lines, the keyboard power/data lines,
the read amplifier signal in your harddisk, etc. Cross-correlation
tests are also useful to measure cross-talk effects between neighbor
cables in your building. As mentioned in our paper, secret data on
your LAN can easily leave your building via phone cables that ran
parallel to your network cable for only a few meters.

Things are somewhat more complicated and I am not convinced that
the e-beam is the primary source of radiation. Your claim that
the Tempest radiation is modulated by the screen grid does not agree with
my practical experience: All signals I get are close to harmonics of
the dot clock and not of the screen grid rate. In addition, the
Tempest monitor cannot distinguish between an all-black and an all-white
image, which it should in the case of a screen-grid caused modulation.
If there is indeed a screen-grid modulation, then it is *much* weaker
than any modulation that you get by software dithering.
Monitors are pretty strange antennas: For instance, my monitor still
radiates quite well (although noticeably weaker) if I switch its power
supply off. Just the passive resonance of the chassis gives a clear
signal in around a meter radius with a simple untuned dipole antenna.
Switching off a monitor alone does not protect you from eavesdropping
a VDU signal, especially if the signal is not just text but a pattern
optimized for reception.
After I unplug the VGA cable however, I can't pick up any signal with
our Tempest receiver unless I bring the antenna almost in contact with
the cable or connector. The closed PC chassis also appears to be no very
big source of VDU emanations, certainly much below the levels that
our receiver can detect.

everyone interested in computer security should be interested in

Come on, copyright piracy is technically trivial today! Little software
is sold with any copyright protection technology, and if, then it is
usually easily broken as the full cleartext machine code is always
available for reverse engineering.
This concerns only individuals who feel important enough to fear that
any organization might want to spend hundreds of dollars per day
to park a grey van full of state-of-the-art DSP and HF equipment
in front of your home exclusively to observe what you do on your

when cellular base stations become freely programmable DSP software
radios that can via the network be turned from GSM-BTSs into
Tempest monitoring stations by a minor software update, then the
paranoid's deep desire to be observed could actually be fulfilled
by evil organizations on a very large scale. Stay tuned ...
Well, I have been thinking about this one, too, and I am quite sure that
we will see such mechanisms showing up in common desktop processors
within the next few years. Then, copyright piracy will become an
interesting technological challenge and research on attacks will
become orders of magnitude more fascinating than now. See
  for details. I am not sure, whether high-security copy protection
is a really bad idea: It could also mean that strict technical
copyright enforcement like it is possible with cryptoprocessors
will change the market situation favourably: Small startup companies
suddenly become able to sell mass market software at prices in
the range of <10 dollars per copy with only a cheap web server as their
distribution infrastructure. When the success of software marketing
is not any more dependent on the distribution infrastructure that
big players like Microsoft enjoy today (retailers, bundling contracts,
etc.), market success would much more depend on the quality of
product and service than on the control over a distribution
system infrastructure. If the copy protection offered by
cryptoprocessors would allow small companies to compete successfully
with high quality ultra-low price software against Microsoft, then
the old shareware distribution concept might actually start to work.
In addition, the same transistors used for bus encryption can
also be used to keep your entire harddisk encrypted without performance
loss and the encrypted software distribution protects you better
against Trojans, so you'll get increased overall security as a free
side effect.

But this is not necessarily, where the the monitor resonates nicely.
Van Eck has reported very similar results in his paper: His VDU
had a dot clock of 11 MHz and he got nice resonance peaks near 125
and 210 MHz.
If you have only a van Eck style receiver, yes. But as soon as you record
the reception over some time and observe the images phases to drift only
slightly against each other, you might be able to separate them using
similar processing techniques as used in computer tomography.

The FCC and your radiologist advise against this. Shielding is much
more elegant than jamming. Remember that CRT content is a periodic
signal, thus you can suppress uncorrelated noise by periodic averaging
rather easily. Good jamming must produce a correlated output signal.
See United States Patents 5165098 and 5297201 for descriptions of
correlated jammers. I don't think, these are widely used though, as the
TEMPEST standards seem to mandate shielding and not jamming, which I
think is very sensible.
