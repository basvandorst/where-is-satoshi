Perhaps a `rating' is discrete, applied to a specific instance (a web
page, a graphic image, a film), while a `reputation' could crudely be
compiled by summing one's ratings?  (I know this is very flawed, but it
could be a starting point for perspective.)

You probably loaded a banner ad from doubleclick -- and downloading the
inline image from their site is sufficient for the cookie transfer to
take place.

I chuckled when this whole Cybank thing started.  Only a month or so
ago, they had some funky bug in their mail system such that all their
internal email was being cc'd to the First Virtual users' mailing list
(and also to one poor individual).  They were helpless and completely
unable to figure it out, as we watched their (not very happy) internal
messages float unrequested into our mailboxes.

Well, I don't have to be subject to such childishness.
Reverse engineering code is like decompiling it.  Starting with the
compiled code, you can translate it backwards (to some degree) and
see how it works.  It's not as easy as taking a compiled program and
ending up with the original C code, but if it's worth enough to you
you -can- end up with the same information.

You mean "libertarian" -- not "libertine".  Got me all hopeful
