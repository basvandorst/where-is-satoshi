Are you sure about  and   I haven't gotten the berkeley one to
work.  I was able to post through pws.bull.com, however, it seems to be
on a UUCP feed and messages get delayed 2-3 days.  Using
group.name is much faster, and also doesn't require dashes, so
you can post to groups like alt.privacy.anon-server, alt.ascii-art, etc.
 This is my current list:
group.name (Kills headers, generates new Message-ID)
group.name (Kills headers, generates new Message-ID)
group.name (Limited newsgroups)
group.name (Limited newsgroups)
group.name (Limited newsgroups)
group.name (Limited newsgroups)
group.name.usenet (Preserves ALL headers)
uunet.ca and cs.dal.ca will bounce the message if it doesn't support the
newsgroup.  paris.ics.uci.edu will just eat it and you'll never see it
again.  uunet.ca doesn't seem to support any alt.groups.  Also, demon
and uwaterloo will preserve most headers (ie comments, etc)  dec.com
will preserve all the headers, including all Received: headers.  The
rest usually remove the non-essential ones.  Uwaterloo, ohio-state, and
Dalhousie insert Orginization: headers advertising their university, but
uci (University of California, Irvine) and uwo.ca (University of Western
Ontario) don't. (-;
