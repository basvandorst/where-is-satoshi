@_subject: Add-in encryption module to Netscape 
Hi, Lurking here for quite some time until now a real problem has come up and I
need help here.
I'm not in the US of A and the Netscape commerce server that my employer recently purchased has only 48bit key (as told by the salesman). My question is
whether it is possible to add-in my own security module (RSA) and secondly, how
difficult is it? The salesman cannot answer me.
Thanks a lot.
