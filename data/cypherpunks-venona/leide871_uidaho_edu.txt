Yikes!  So how does one unsubscribe to this list?  Not that I want to
unsubscribe, but from the number of people that post their subscribe and
unsubscribe messages directly to the listserver, I take it this is a
problem?  Or are they simply illiterate?
Could somone please email me or post the proper method to unsubscribe and
resubscribe?  Thanks.
