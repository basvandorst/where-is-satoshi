freedom to, there is freedom _from_. I think that the same thing could be said for Security. On one hand you have the security to leave your house, safe in the knowlege that the majority of your stuff will be there when you return, and the security to walk the streets without the fear of getting attacked. On the other hand some would have the security of knowing that _no one_ is downloading dirty pictures, the security that the "wrong" person is not getting their hands on dangerous information etc. college or just life) there is freedom TO--such as freedom to move to another country, the freedom to exchange ideas without constraint, in other words the freedom to do things--and the freedom FROM--from hunger, from fear, freedom from failure, freedom from being challenged, freedom from choice.
the freedom FROM, rather than freedom TO, and their security is the the enoforced security of a prison, or a police state. without, it must come from within. With freedom this is self-explanatory, no one can set you free, you have to do it.
one will be constantly troubled by "threats" to those beliefs. Witness the "Christian Right" in this country. Physcial security works the same way. If one takes care of ones community, working with ones neighbors etc., and applying social pressure to those who potentially threaten your physcial security you will live in a much healthier, and less dangerous enviroment (yeah, this is a little simplestic but you get the idea).

I took a few days to think about this stuff, and I am replying to these
in bulk rather than seperately.
Can anything be done? To stop the likely effects of lots more
surface-to-air missiles, lots more nerve gas available on the black market,
and so on?
In a word, "no."
     I disagree. Terrorism, political terrorism is fear. There are ways to
protect military targets that are quite cost effective, unfortunately they
are politically unpopular. (What just happend in Saudi is on my mind.
STUPID military commanders getting the same pie in the face time and time
again. There is NOTHING so unchanging as the military mind set.)
Civilian targets are harder to protect, but certain steps can be
taken to lessen chances of a sucessful attack.
Another method, and this would be very unpopular (and
hypocritical of the US) would be simply to announce that we (the Country)
are going to hold the _manufacturing_ nation responcible for the use of
weapons of mass destruction. So if Soviet Nerve Gas is used, we gas a
city in the Soviet Union. MAD carried to a lower level. A third option is quite simply to buy as much of it as possible. I expect a city or two to get nuked in the next decade or so. (Haifa or Tel
Aviv would be my leading candidates.) To me, this is unsurprising.

     Paris
     New York
     Rome
     London
     LA (by home brewed idiots)
     Chicago
     Berlin.
     I don't think that terrorists in the middle east will pop a nuke as
they would get as many of their own as the "enemy". One of the things a
terrorist needs more than money is a place to hide, and if you are killing
your own people, they won't shield you. moderate economic or physical crises. (No, I am not a "survivalist," just

dislocation, or terrorist incident in San Jose, which is 30 miles north of
examples of how the Net can be used to undermine governments (what those
governments of course refer to as "terrorism," even when it is mostly not).
I'm not advocating such "terrorism," by the way, merely telling it like it is.
If you want to define terrorism as in the above paragraph, them I am,
and you do too. The biggest problem with terrorism is that there isn't a
good defination that looks the same from both sides. In otherwords the old
saw about one mans terrorist being anothers freedom fighter. Any
defination sufficiently inclusive so as to cover all "terrorist"
activities will also include uniformed soldiers. The lines get very thin
and blurry. Keep your head down, avoid crowded downtown areas, prepare for moderate
disruptions, and reject arguments that an American Police State will do
anything to stop terrorism.
The american police state (and if we aren't one yet, it isn't for lack
of trying) IS an instrument of terrorism in some parts of this country. (Remember, terrorism is just warfare carried on by other means, with
apolgies to Von Clausewitz.)
Thanks Tim for your essay.  The only thing I would add is that terrorist
attacks  on pure information resources (e.g. the banking system) are likely
to result in many fewer casualties than terrorist attacks on physical
entities (e.g. major cities).  Another way of saying it is, email bombs are
preferable to snail mail bombs.
I don't think so. One objective of terrorism is/could be to lessen a populations faith
in "The System". Some possible situations (can't remember how to spell
Trash a multi-store pharmacy database and people can't get their
prescriptions, or worse get the wrong one. Cause disturbances in certain parts of certain cities, then attack
the 911 system to route officers and firemen to _wealthy_ neigborhoods at
the expense of the poor neighborhoods. Then complain to the papers about
it. Gain control of the power grid (I don't know how possible this is)
and selectively brown out certain sections of the city during peak demand
periods. Make it obvious, then do the preceeding idea.  In all of these people will, or could die, but are much more
effective in undermining the faith people have in the structures that run
the country. If a bomb blast goes off, people get pissed off at the bomb
makers, if the power fails, people get pissed at the electrical company.

*/ try to have a warfare, siege-like mentality imho, and a continual
"trying to stay ahead of the criminals". we do not have
regular open terrorism in the streets of the US and I see no reason
to think there ever will be as TCM suggests.
Depending on how you define "terrorism" I would like you to visit my
neighborhood, and then we can go to a couple other here in chicago where
the cops terrorize the citizens, the gangs terrorize the cops and the
citizens, etc. It hasn't hit the national level yet, but it will. nevertheless what his essay misses, and many in law enforcement miss,
are the root reasons for crime. I'm not going to sound like a liberal
There is a big difference (IMO) between a terrorist and a common criminal.
Money and Ideology. In *MOST* instances the terrorist is attempting to
acheive a political, social, or long term (as in decades/generations)
economic change. A criminal is simply trying to get rich or get stoned.
IMO the root cause of crime is a lack of self disipline, and it is as far
as I can tell part of the human condition. in reality. it seems to me no nation-state has ever experimented with
trying to take away the root causes of violence and discontent. why? Is it possible that to a large degree the nation-state IS the problem?
because a policeman holding a gun is so much more visceral and
the public responds to this image readily.  other "programs" that
try to decrease discontent among the budding terrorists of tommorrow
are usually ridiculed. it is very difficult to prove that they work
Rightly so. Most of these programs amount to hand-outs or paternalistic
pandering. People need to work, not get paid for doing nothing. */ terrorists invariably have a patricular pathological psychological profile that sees the world
in terms of "martyrs vs. villians" with the villians in the government,
and the villians taking away or abusing respectable citizens.
Often they are right. the "problem" of terrorism will be solved when we take the view
that insanity and violence is *not* a natural aspect of human behavior (as TCM tends to suggest), and that
It is. Insanity is a condition that occasionaly crops up in humans.
Sometimes the problem is chemical, sometimes not, however it _is_ natural.
So is violence. People want things, and some don't care what they have to
do to get these things. disagree. the purpose of warfare has traditionally been to seize
something tangible like territory. terrorists are after intangibles--
namely, terror itself, disrupting a "peace process", etc. Or forcing a certain group to the discussion table.

I think a clear line can be established between terrorist
incidents and battles/fights/raids/attacks carried out by other
"legitimate" troops or guerilla fighters.      Military troops can best be protected by 3 seperate methods:
    1)  Don't put them in situations were they are targets for terrorism         abroad. Soldiers and Marines exist to elivate the ENEMIES body
        counts, not ours. By putting troops trained to fight in defensive         passive positions you are exposing them to terrorist attacks, and         ruining their combat reflexes.      2) When they _are_ exposed, let them fight the fuck back. Rules of         engagment are simple. When fired on, shoot to kill. If the shot         comes from a building, take out the building. If from a crowd,         well, do you best, but _get the shooter_.      3) Again when operating in a potentially deadly enviroment, follow the
        standard anti-terrorist rules. Vary your routines, don't bunch up,
        Be unpredictable. None of these were done in the Saudi blast, Nor         where they done in Beruit 12 years ago. out by a civilian (in the sense that he was not acting as a part of any government, official or otherwise and not wearing a uniform etc.)      I kinda mis-spoke. The way I should have put it was: 	
     Steps can be taken to make attacks less likely, and to make it easier to capture the individuals responcible afterwords.     Think about it. Why have we had so little terrorism in this country? This is one of the most diverse countries in the world, we allow damn near
anyone breathing into this country, yet we have much less terrorism than does England, France, Germany etc.      Why? IMO It is opportunity. Maybe everyone who emigrates here doesn't get rich, but they are almost _all_ better off than in their original
countries. By keeping this country as free as possible, and allowing the
free exchange of ideas, not jailing (too many) people for political/religious
opnions you at least give the appearance that they can change things w/out
killing things and breaking people. This makes it much harder for the potential terrs. to get the financial backing. It also reduces sympathy for them in the community.      IMO as long as people have the illusion of freedom and upwards mobility coupled with the ability to pray to the stupidity of their choice
things will maintain an even keel in this country. You will have the occasional UniBomber, but I don't think you will get anything like that Japanese Cult w/sarin. Then again we have come close. in a one time take it or leave it for their entire chemical weapon stock,
it might get the soviet shit off the market. The nuclear stuff is a little easier to store (I think) and it would be a harder sell. Petro, Christopher C.

Tourettes was brought up to explain one small boys behavior towards his mother. He would (IIRC) call her a "fucking asshole", yet he didn't seem to have these sorts of problems around his father. True tourettes is not an emotional problem, it is _very_ rare, and the person with tourettes
does not curse at only one person.     Undisiplined brats do have emotional problems. Parents who are under the ignorant mis-apprehension that children do not need disipline are the
cause of more than a few of this societies problems.      It is a disease becasuse the people who get paid to diagnois and treat it call it a disease?      Is it a crime because a cop thinks it is a crime?      I will admit to the possibility of ADD being a "disease", but I think that the number of children who really have the disease is small compared to the number of childern recieving drugs for it.      15 years ago I would have been diagnoised as having ADD. I had trouble paying attention in class, I spent a lot of time looking out the window. I was a mild behavior problem. I didn't have ADD. I was simply bored by a system that either taught me stuff that was irrelevant (I thought so 15 years ago, and feel so today), that taught so badly as to seem irrelevant
(like algebra & higher math) (notice SEEM, I feel much different now), or taught stuff that was simply wrong (I don't remember examples now, but I remember calling teachers on wrong info back in HS, and getting in trouble
for it).
pornographer and throwing them in jail, we should arrest them, convict them
(after all, they must be hiding something with that crypto) and then throw
them in jail. Is that what you are saying?
        NO, WE CAN"T DO THAT THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY LEARN SOMETHING.         Look at the difference between the numbers of ADD kids in private schools and public schools.       Uh.. That was a joke. Seriously tho' There is a difference between some
one who takes Lithium to even out neurochemistry, and a person who takes prozac to even take the edges off.      One is a medical condition, one is a psychological problem.      Last time I checked the only symptom of Bipolar Manic depression I didn't have was suicide ideation. I have homicidal ideation.      I am not joking at this point. I'd be willindg to bet that I fall
VERY near the "Manic Depressive" line.      I just doubt that there are more than a small percentage of people out there who have mental illnesses that need strong drugs to combat. More people
SHOULD just learn to deal with it. I have found a couple of things that really help take the edge off my problems. Regular exercise is one. I recently started bike riding again, and I am doing 22+ miles a day. For the first time in about 10 years I have been sleeping a semi-regular schedule
(about 6 hours a night) I have been exercising about 3 weeks now, so we will see what happens.      This gets into what you are about to say, but in my case I am dealing
with my problems the best I can. It would be a hell of a lot easier to simple
take that little pill and have a nice calm chemical existence. It would be a lot easier to allow GAK and escrow. It is much better on all levels to deal with it yourself as much as possible.      I had never used PGP until today. Yes, I had D/Led it, compiled it, and installed it but never published a key, nor encrypted anything. An instance arose where someone else insisted I use it, so I figured it out. No problems.
     Part of the reason it was no problem is that I have spent a lot of time figuring shit out on my own, and only asking for help when I needed it,
or to help point the way. Too many people don't want that. They want all the questions answered for them. They like their mental fog and feel threatened
by people who don't.      I'd bet that a lot of these so called "ADD" kids are the ones who ask the hard questions in class, the ones who threaten to wake the other students
up. Can't have that.      Well, something we agree on anyway.      Again, I am not saying that there are NO ADD kids, I know one, and he is a mess. However, there are many kids who are labeled ADD who aren't. I know
what Speed does to a person, Been there. Liked that (remember the Manic Depressive? I _LIKE_ manic.), but speed is very dangerous stuff, and highly addicted. Got an ex-friend to testify to that. Or he would if he could breath.  Petro, Christopher C.

A heart attack is (or used to be) a normal way of dying.
     Dying is natural. It is even (in some cases, and from certain perspectives) desirable.      So are dreamers, so are doers. Poets, Priests and Garbage collectors.
The problem is that in this society parents don't want (largely, painting with a BIG BIG brush and painting over some people) dreamers or garbage collectors, poets or artists. They want CPA's and Programmers, attentive
little students, of course the kids nature has nothing to do with it.
     Remember a year or so an add for Joop Jeans? A "Yuppie" looking woman
with a baby on a leash (like a dog collar and leash) with the words
"A child, the ultimate pet". That seems to be the position that many parents seem to be taking these days. They don't have kids, they have prize pedegree Children. These children are expected to behave without training, to
follow rules without being disiplined (funny how that word keeps popping up
in these posts) and to perform in the 90th percentile in everything.       On the other end we have growing pool of warm bodies whose parents are just barely warm bodies. They aren't taking prozac and ritilan to get thru
school, with them it is coke, crack, pot, horse and alcohol. Their parents are barely even aware of their existance.      IMO both of these are from the same mentality, the attitude of a child as a cute little pet.      What causes this hypertension? Maybe rather than medicating you  should eliminate the CAUSE of the problem.
     Of course that is more work than just taking a pill.      Actually, I would.      I would worry more about a kid who _wants_ speed than one who doesn't.      Correct me if I am wrong, but aren't children more sensative to chemicals than adults?

" DEFINING ORGANIZED CRIME
We could define organized crime as an agreement between men to forward a common cause, using other humans as tools for advancement, without regard to the health or happiness of those "other" humans outside the group.
Using humans may involve selling them as slaves, selling them as prostitutes, draining their resources with addictive drugs or gambling, extortion, theft, kidnapping, or murder. These are generally associated with organized crime, and not with "legitimate business"."

     I don't mind doing it, but I tend to be a little authoritarian about
these kinds of things. I arrange an almost monthly meeting for a bunch

On the other group I have the meetings at my house, and my Wife's grand mother died. Immediate grounds for a change other reasons could be a major conference that I didn't know about etc. An individual being out of town is
not a reason, at every random event there will be someone who would prefer a different day.      The other thing to consider is where to hold the event. There are a couple of decent pubs/bars here in Chicago, or Coffee Houses. I would prefer not to hold the first one in my home, because I am paranoid.

put the pin back in and continue on about your business. A bit of overkill
maybe, but you don't really need to aim all that well.

I was 17 when Uncle Shithead handed me my first M-16, and I wasn't the youngest person in my company.
     I'm in my late 20's, and respect for human life is lower than ever.
     Yes, those guns are evil things. Evil I tell you, constantly shooting
people for no reason, going off half-cocked and whooping it up all by their polished oiled ol selves.
     Isn't it funny how otherwise rational people can ascribe intentions
and moral alignement (ie. good/evil) to an inert chunk of steel?
     I was driving tractors(small ones) and motorcycles long before I turned 16. My father started teaching me to drive a car (thru asking questions &etc.) when I was about 12, and put me behind the wheel of a van when I was 15 (in a controled situation away from traffic).      He also taught me the basics of gun saftey, and made sure that
I took those classes that were available to me in the areas of gun saftey and marksmanship.    Then again for all his faults my father is a relatively rational human being about most things. Petro, Christopher C.

There is a difference between teaching a 6 year old proper gun saftey and letting the kid carry.      If it was you, you said that you were going to let your kid have a gun until he was old enough te get it himself. How do you expect him/her to know how to use it if you don't teach them? Would you give a kid the keys to a car at 16 if they have never been taught how to drive?

This sir is pure crap. In fact it is far more likely that an armed and prepared occupant will take out a thug.

their homes (in the case of the 86 year old, sexual assault was also occuring)
In both cases at least on of the perps died. As they deserved too.       These people (burglars) are not worth the bullet it takes to get rid of them. Petro, Christopher C.

Not the networks, the local stations. Each station decides where to slot a specific non-network show.      In many time slots he was competing sucessfully with The Late Show, and The Other Idiot (sorry, it has been a long time since I watched TV, so I can't remember the other idiots name).      In one city he was place opposite Oprah Winfrey, and _still_ had decent
ratings, but the TV stations got a lot more complaints about him at 3 in the
afternoon, so they put him on after midnight.
     His TV show did not suceed or fail because of what Limbaugh did, but rather on decesions that were totally out of his hands. That is why he
is not renewing his contracts.      Please do not lump all militias in with the Chistian Identity & Klan types, you just display more and more ignorance. Petro, Christopher C.

Go North on Sheridan (right turn off of LSD) to Thorndale                 (About 5900 North)              Turn left on Thorndale (heading west) and drive to Broadway                 (About 4 or 5 blocks)              Park.

it would make their jobs easier) Anyway: call it 20 teams.      Saturday afternoon (preferably mid may) in 20 Walmarts across the country 20 stolen cars go boom (really big boom) at about the same time.      Sunday Morning Sarin gas introduced into churches.
     Monday Morning, Rush hour:
     In LA, New York, Boston, Miami, New Orleans, Phoenix, Chicago, San Francisco, St. Louis, San Diego, Seattle, Portland, Albuquerque, Las Vegas (is there a rush hour in Las Vegas?) Houston, Cinncinatti(sp?), Atlanta, Little Rock, Detriot, & Des moines, cars parked along side of the highway (near bridges were possible) blow up. Around noon that day, thermite and WP gernades (or home made equivalents) are ignited in the buisness districts (or casinos of Las Vegas).      The government will react with overwhelming restrictions of personal freedom, and the militas will react, the government will clamp down further,
the militias will gain popularity & america will divide itself.      If I were inclined to such behavior, and had the funding, That is how I would do it.      Other ideas: Random Shelling of business districts, airports and subdivisions.  Petro, Christopher C.

As long as you are enforcing it on everyone, I don't think you'd have a problem, but to force some one from cooking food for homeless people, and allow a family barbeque, is IMO wrong. If it is unsafe/unsanitary to cook food in a certain way, it is unsafe/unsanitary. Selective enforcement is wrong.      Force the yuppies on a sunday afternoon barbeque to get a permit and see how long the law lasts.

don't use the security features, and don't understand them. If they know what

I spend very little time with the mainstream media, I really don't know.

Some would say that 1) Saddam (as a problem) was _created_ by the US, and it would not be in the interest of certain people to have him die.
Along the same lines, Castro, while not exactly friendly (and who can blame him) to the US, is also not a threat, and never really has been. Killing him would serve no purpose.
     Killing some one (the physical act, not the emotional consequences) is
easy. Denyability is a little (only a little) tougher.      There are always Captians who go down with the ship, Boys who stick their fingers in dykes, and Some fool leading the charge when the odds
are overwhelming. This is either the highest calling (to fight back against all odds, and refuse to give in) or pure stupidity (he who runs away lives
to fight another day). You pick.     If by "at will" you mean _any time_ _any where_, yeah. Short of building
your own nuclear device, yeah. If you mean there are people who can't be gotten to, then no. Everyman has his price, and his coin.     The second time AP is implicated in a murder, and is not stopped, then it will _start_ to intimidate. More likely it will be stopped.      There are no illegitimate targets.      Doubtful. It would take more than one talented person. It would take
an organization, and a permanent net connextion. This would be difficult for
a lone psychopath to carry out.
     Bullshit. Is Einstein morally responsible for the Atomic Bomb?      Col. Colt for the murders that the guns he created accomplished?      Ronald McDonald & his PR firm for all of the obese people in this      country?
     Driving 65 is very close to driving 66, which is against the law.
I suggest that people think very carefully before driving at 65 miles per hour.      Yes, it is. Especially when other people do it all the time, and don't
get punished. Clinton just "murdered" a bunch of people in Iraq. He talked
about it, then he did it. He calls it "War". So do I. I am involved in a war for _my_ rights. I will probably loose, but I must do what I determine
is right. Assinating the president would not further my goals. At no time in the foreseeable future would killing the president bring me any closer to
my goals. This being so, killing the president would be a stupid idea.
     When I joined the Marine Corps, I took an oath to protect this country,

It wouldn't ADD more violence.      Putting AP into place doesn't make murder legal. You could still be arrested, tried (depending on the jurisdiction) and punished for it.      All AP allows is people who don't have the skills necessary to do the job pay for it.     Wait, that didn't come out right.
    AP simply allows people without the assination skill set to purchase access to those skill sets annonymously. There are many, many people out
there who are either too squemish to kill, or are philosophically opposed
to killing. They won't use this system. There are many other without the skills nessary to kill higher level targets without getting caught.    Without getting caught. That is the key. There is a very good chance would AP be implemented that someone might put make a bet on me. I tend to piss people off. I am also a slightly harder target than Joe Average.
Not much, because of the neighborhood I live in. Around here you could probably buy my death for a $100 bucks worth of crack.    Of course, the police will investigate, and since I am white, and not
involved with gangs and drugs, they might even bother to find out who wacked me.     If someone hits Bill Clinton, then there is a very good chance that
many many people will be wondering who won the bet. While it isn't possbile
(assuming here) to trace the bet side, the assination is an event that takes
place in the real world where physical evidence is considerably difficult to obscure.       There will be people looking for both killers, but I'd bet that the
people investigating Clintons death would be much more likely to be bet against than those investigating mine. Petro, Christopher C.

     I would assert that if children (ALL of them) had been thru a class
in the Hows and Whys of the constitution, rather than the glossing over that I remember, our government would be a lot different. I am not talking about _just_ an intense memorization of the document, but a reading of the federalist papers (which I still haven't gotten all the way thru) and a month or two of purely discussing and analyzing the document, the Feds couldn't get away with what they are doing.      I agree that students who aren't cut out for the academic life should
be incouraged to persue trades, or the arts (which IMO are simply trades,
and my degree will be a BFA when I finish that last Art History class) but
citizenship is _everyones_ responsibility, and there are too many people clamoring for laws & amendments without thinking, and without understanding
the process. Our schools are not turning out thinkers, and that is a (IMO)
a fatal flaw.      This is the OBCrypto part: For Crypto(in the sense of anonymity and
pseudoanonymity) to truely be accepted and appreciated by the "general public (yes, a vague term), they need to understand the history of anonymous
publications. They need to understand _why_ people should want to publish
     The other side is that for your "crypto-anarchy" to succeed, we need people who can understand things like "algorythms" and "mathmatical proofs".
     The rest of this is [NOISE].      I have bought "work clothes"--collared shirts, trousers &etc--at SalAr, and my wife still does. She works for the Merc as a secretary. These many of these people are unwilling to do _anything_ to help themselves,
and it is the fault of everyone who ever handed them a dime. As one former listmember ranted one day "You know why there are beggars in this city?"..."Because people like you (not me, his partner) GIVE THEM MONEY".
People wouldn't beg if it got them nothing.       Oops. You made that point.      While I'd agree that this is true for many, I know some (me, my brother
and a couple of my cousins) that have done work like this more than once. Not that I would do that kind of work (for pay) today, unless I was _real_
     Then again, it could be a family thing.      I see no reason that general programming shouldn't be considered a trade. Maybe more "pure" math than a carpenter, or a mechanic, but they
don't need the english, general history, & etc. that other "academic" careers need.       Cutting off hands is a little drastic. Too prone to false aqusations,
and too hard to erase if the courts are wrong. Three years at hard labor

false, it is erase from the record.     People die for all manner of reasons every day. Fuck'em.

Mr. Stewart said:
     Each reply refers to the remailer before it.      The originating web site hands the originator a key and a pseudo-random
ID. The originator can check check back on a regular basis to see if a reply
came back in. That way there is no "final trail" and the reciepent can view the page thru something like       Set a time limit on replies (say 5 days) and after the 5 days, the reply is deleted by the server. That way the casual user would have to hack the code to _keep_ the addresses on hand, and the censors would have to get back thru the entire chain in 5 days, and they don't know the
entire chain to begin with. If you can get the web server spread out internationally, that ain't gonna happen.      If you inert the *this is an anonymous email* automaticaly, this won't matter as much. Commercial spammers will have to put a commercial access point (phone, fax, email address) in their message
and people who are just harassing others will get deleted pretty quick.
     Spam itself will be cut back as you only allow  number of addresses per message, and set it up so that you enter the addresses
on a seperate page from the message. That way to hit 2 or 3 hundered email addresses you have to enter the message 100 times. Ok, so cut and
paste 100 times, but if the spammer has a brain (I know, but there may be one or two) they are going get the spam out.      How about this (It is a little complicated, so it may not work)
     Alice wants to send email to Bob, so she hit's sameers anonmymizer
site to go to a random remailer web site.      At this site she enters Bobs email address on one page, and on the
next enters her message. This message could even be encrypted, assuming that
Bob knows what to do with it. Hit send.
     The webremailer software hands Alice a temporary (10 day expire time) ID and key/passphrase.
     The webremailer selects the next mailer in the chain, encrypts the message, writes the public key and encrypted message to disk (with date stamp), and forwards the email (encrypted message + key) to the next remailer.      The second (and each succeeding remailer in the chain) simply re-writes
the headers and writes a keyid/previous-remailer pair file (with date stamp)
to file. (maybe even keep a single database file with this info in it, a single file might not get written to disk as often (maybe) and with constant
would be marginally harder to "recover" old addresses from than multiple hard
files (or would it?) and then sends the mail on.
    If we can use the "puts" feature, we really don't need much in the way of
headers right?
    Anyway the last remailer in the chain writes a simple web page with the keyid of the keypair, and simply sends the key and an address to the receipent
so that 1) the final "message" is still not the email, only a notice that email is waiting, for instance     The reciepient then goes to the site (or doesn't if they don't want
email) they can use  if they wish, and they enter their key
when prompted. The encrypted file is then decrypted and sent to them.
    At this point, the encryption is more to prevent the "prying eyes" than TLA level snooping, so it has to be good, but it doesn't have to be 2000 bit
RSA type stuff. That can be done at the message level.     Return messages would include the keyid of the sent message, and would retrace the same hops. At the original end, a simple web page is written
and a "you have a reply to your anonymous message at     Holes?

GAK is for the "common good", after all, it is only the people who are
doing wrong that will be hurt by having their data scanned by the Government,
it is just maintaining decency standards.       For most of my life I have had insomnia, and when I was in my early
to mid teens, I used to wait until my parents had gone to sleep, and go out and wander the neighborhood, Mostly alone, sometimes until 2 or
3 in the morning (during the summer, not when I had to be at school).
     Why _shouldn't_ I be allowed to do this? In my case, it was against my parents wishes, but I still harmed nothing, commited no crime (there was no curfew where I lived). My father almost caught me (he knew I did it
from time to time, but figured as long as I wasn't causing trouble, he wouldn't be able to stop me). Just because other children cause trouble, why
should _mine_ be restricted? Just because it gives the APPERANCE OF MORALITY?
     I'll say that again, THE APREARANCE OF MORALITY. Forcing someone to follow a given set of rules doesn't make that person moral, it makes them a slave. Morality only comes in when there is choice.      Also, the waters are calm on the surface, but what about underneath? What is going on behind closed doors? Here in the outerworld, we have fornication on the streets, but we know who is doing it, we _know_ who the problems are. Do you?        Almost all teenagers are on their way to a dead end. It is called "Adulthood", which if you look at it a certain way looks a lot like A Dolt Hood.      I don't necessarily think it is a bad idea to mix kids (mid to late teens) picked up for "real" crimes in with "real"  criminals, but then
I don't think that staying out late should be a crime.      Fear can be a powerful motivator.       Really, I should be in "the system" because I like wandering around at
night?      Real libertarian of you.      Mr. May's usage of "state" means "governing body" rather than "state of
the union". But you knew that. There are many other "interception" points that can be utilized to identify children whose parents are not providing them with the state approved ideological underpinings, Let's take a look at some shall we?      Your children do well in school correct? Straight A's in most classes? it is obvious that you are driving your children too hard, teaching them tp
be overacheivers. You shouldn't push them so hard, they should stay at the level of their classmates.      Ok, that was hyperbole. Seriously tho', if you talk to many "social workers"  they can give you certain behavior patterns that
indicate a child is being abused in the home. They could (and I am sure some would like to) go so far as to include certain types of religious and political
indoctrination as abuse.      If the state (city/county) mandates it, and it gives the apperance of "stopping crime", or simply provides a smooth surface, is it worth it?          alcohol is available at any large grocery store; it has not been
    Not in your area, and maybe not my LDS's, but try Pell City Alabama.
Same mentality, different name on the church house door.      Can, or should? Let _me_ run the DEA, and give me a good budget, and I will stop it. Yeah, people will die, but they are dying anyway.      Yet you argue for the abridgement of freedoms based on age. Does the state know better than a parent when a minor is old enough to be out after
     Which really only pisses most people off because it is a different
revisionist history than they want taught.      Or, he will push too far, too fast, and it will snap back in his face.

of bleach with the feds? I can make a mustard gas clone out of it. You wanna
register your bag of sugar? There are explosives that can be made out of it.
     Hell, **OXYGEN** is toxic in high concentrations. You wanna track THAT?
     Life is %100 fatal. You can't change that.
     Why? What percentage of murders are _solved_ because the police find the murder weapon, and use THAT to track it back to the killer? I'd bet that
it is an insignificant percentage (first person who points out a single case
gets the twit award--a free copy of GNU emacs source code mailed to your email
address--I KNOW it happens, but is it statistically common? No.)      And why track autos? Nosy little feds wanna know where I am?      But by saying MEAN THINGS, you are hurting people, and that is wrong.      Defending yourself isn't necessary, We, the government will do that for you.      Tracking chemicals...
     Sounds like one of these has happened already, and I don't hear you
     1) Torture doesn't change someones mind. There are other means of doing that.      2) Very unimaginative.      Or just make it unnecessary to carry out terrorist acts.      You don't trust _any_ government, yet you want them to track _every_
chemical that people purchase?      There is crypto relevance in there somewhere I think...

@_subject: Re: Usenet and Re: extortion via digital cash 
To quote the title of a movie "That was then, this is now".        More and more I am coming around to the idea that reliance on political
solutions to problems is a mistake. Every politician is out for what he can
get, and every judge is out to change the world. More and more judges will be products of an eductional system that is soured by the tenets of modern liberalism. The foolish notion of a benevolent paternalistic government, coupled with the Hallam-Baker like ideas of man as a violent wicked beast that
must be "nurtured" (i.e. controlled and lead) for his or her own good.      I reject the idea that all men must be controlled for their own, or
societies, good. I believe that there are good people, and bad people. I beleive that good people do what is right, regardless, and bad people will
find a way to take advantage of any system that is in place.       Nothing can stop good people from doing what is right (as opposed to making them do wrong, which is a different matter), and nothing will stop bad people from doing wrong.
     That last was important, so I'll repeat it. Nothing will stop bad people from doing wrong. Nothing. They will take advantage of any system that
you put in place. Can't be helped, any more than you can stop a hurricane, an earthquake, or a dog from marking his territory. It is simply their nature.      The idea is to minimize the danger to the good people. If you have to put systems into place, make them as simple and unobtrusive as they need to
be. Make them as fool proof as possible. These two requirements mean that you need to keep people out of the system as much as possible. People complicate
things. People (most) are foolish.      The court system is a prime example of this. The mission of the courts is simple, seperate the guilty from the not guilty (there are no innocents,
at least not enough to worry about). People get involved, and what do you have?
a system where it takes _teams_ of people on both sides to argue "guilt" or "innocence" based on arcane bits of obscure rules and traditions. Once
guilt or not-guilt has been established, and this is in a case where there
is a binary (1 or not 1) outcome is possible.       Constitutional law seems to be a much bigger gamble, and I personally
have no doubt that politics plays a HUGE part in their descesions.      Cypherpunks are supposed to write code, they are supposed to deploy code, and they are supposed to promote the writing, use, and deploying of code.      Unfortunately I can't write code. I've tried, and my mind doesn't work that way. I do what I can to talk about crypto, security, and privacy issues,
to get other people to think about these things, and to get the code deployed.      Technology cannot (yet) be good or bad. It isn't like people, it has no intentionality, no motives, no dreams, or beliefs, it simply is. People are not to be trusted, and this includes the supremes.

At first I had a big problem with Vulva being kicked off the list, but I thought about it a while, and as more information developed I came
to the following conclusion:
     Vulis wasn't banned from the list because of _off topic_ posts, nor
was he booted for descenting opnions. He was not removed without warning,
nor for an occasional flame. He was removed for persistent off-topic flaming, after at least one warning, and several people asking him to stop.
     The closest anology I can find in real life would be a bar, were people
any person (well, any person old enough, but we'll ignore that) is allowed to wander in, order a drink, watch TV, shout at the screen ocassionally eat the pretzels and etc. Off in the corner you have a drunk dancing off
time to the noise on the jukebox, but most of the patrons can ignore him.
    Vulis is sitting square in the middle of the bar, sloshed to the gills
throwing pretzels and peanuts at both fans of the opposing team, and fans of his team. Screaming at the top of his lungs about the quarterback for a totally different team fumbling the ball in the 1970 world series.
    The bar tender asks Vulis politely to cease and desist. Vulis pours his beer on him. Vulis then demands another drink, insisting it is his
right to a beer. At this point the Big Bearded Guy at the door with the USMC tattoo, and the 37 knife scars drops his ham sized mit on Vulis's  shoulder.      "Buddy" he says "If you don't quiet down and watch the game I'm going
to have to ask you to leave".        "Fuck you, you ignorant sovek  pansy" was Vulis' reply.      The next sound was Vulis' head opening the door so the rest of his body could follow it onto the street, where he stands screaming curses at the patrons and the doorman.
     Of course now it is quieter inside, and the noise level will drop even
more once Vulis quiets down, sobers up, or just goes home, and after the other drunks quit pondering the situation aloud, and go back to discussing the game. Then the only obstruction will be the drunk in the corner who keeps stumbling into the jukebox, causing the record to scratch.
     Then there is the patron who left the bar a couple weeks ago in disgust
because he didn't want to talk _about_ football, he just wanted to discuss how to make the pitchers better able to slam dunk, and he is planning
to open his own bar down the street...

It is not that difficult in term of money or access to start a mailing list.     I believe there is a equation that operates in life that goes something
like this:
    Intelligence + Money + Time * will = Results     As one goes up, the other two can drop. Will is kinda nebulous, but is always less than result.
    I am not a rocket scientist, but I was able to get majordomo to work
(to a degree) on a server I own, yes, I own the server, and no, I don't pay for it with cash. I do a favor for someone, and they gave me the machine ( to see the favor). The access is provided by some people I occasionally do work for, as long as the machine
is not causing a problem, or too much bandwidth, they let me run it.
    This would make the equation:
    Intelligence + money + time * will = Result
        Some     +  0    + a bit * some = A server with 4 or 5 mailing lists.      A simple mailing list could simply be a 8 dollar a month email account
with a long .forward file.       For every "tentacle" of the Vast Media Conglomerates, there is some loose nut with a photocopier (or access to Kinko's).      WHO is nuts?      One of these days reality is going to hit you like a runaway freight train. Petro, Christopher C.

So you are explaining your problems in advance. Good, it tells thoughtful readers to take you with a grain of salt.      Ok, I will try to keep from using too long words so you can understand
me.      You forget "shutting down" the source of input. Turning off the radio, TV etc, or turning off the person speaking.     No problems with that.      It still isn't censorship. Censorship, at least in my dictionary, refers to censor, which uses the word "Official" several times. Mr. Gilmore is not an "Official" in a government sense, he maybe in the EFF
sense, but this is not an "Official" EFF organ, so that doesn't count.      He is the OWNER of this list, and the machine it runs on. If he chooses
(which he didn't) to keep someone from using the list, it is his right.
     WRONG. the "net' wasn't compared to either a home or a private club,
THIS LIST WAS. No one has the right to kick anyone off public streets, the
police _do_, but I seriously doubt that they could arrest you for refusing.
Gilmore didn't "Ban" Vulis from "The Net" (in fact he didn't even ban him from the list, he just removed him from the distribution list), he didn't
even try.
     He also didn't prevent Vulis from posting, tho' he could have.      Again I repeat myself:
    Vulis was not "removed" in any way, shape, or form from "the net", all
Gilmore did was "Turn his back" on Vulis, saying in effect "Your bullshit
isn't wanted here".     He didn't tell Vulis to keep his opnion to himself, no one on this list did. He, and others here were asking Vulis to stop his repeated personel attacks on other list members, some were asking him to stop his vitrolic rants on racial and ethnic groups as well, which were _way_ off topic.       You know, from your position I'd say you have a very clear view of your colon.      "Editorial Control" means that someone decides who get's published and
who doesn't. From your opposition to it, I guess you think that a magazine
dedicated to poetry should print all poems submitted, or as many, selected
in some sort of non-judgemental order, as they can fit. Or that a magazine
should print any writings submitted to it.      I run 4 mailing lists, one is personal, one is in the process of coming
online, and 2 are up and running. One of these has a rule: No Politics allowed.
I guess I am a pathetic little censorous worm huh? Nope. That rule was put there for a very good reason, and I am that reason. I love to talk politics,
but that is the WRONG FORUM for it.     Just like this is the wrong forum for Vulis to spew his shit.     Yes, and the cypherpunks list DOES THAT. Vulis wasn't kicked off for opposing Crypto, or the spread of Crypto, he was kicked off for littering,
and for refusing to stop littering. Actually he was kicked off for daring Gilmore to make him stop littering.       Not really, he was simply refusing to let Vulis share his (Gilmore's)
podium.      How would this happen? Setting up a press is fairly easy, at least a small hand operated press. Start your own magazine, start your own
mailing list.      That is what freedom is, the ability to _do it yourself_ not the requirement that others do it for you, or allow you to use what they have already built. Petro, Christopher C.

@_subject: Mounting Crypted directories on Multiuser Machines. 
I was wondering about something:        Say you have a unix (or other multi-user OS) box, how hard would  it be for someone who was good at programming to modify Blaze's CFS to  allow the following:
       Every user has a directory:
      /home/usr1/
           /usr2/
           /usr3/
       and inside each directory they have:
       /home/usr1/html/
                 /files/
                 /.login                     /.usr1crypt
      such that /.usr1crypt gets mounted at _login_ time as a crypted file
 system under /files.
      The way I envision this is that one would log in (either from the console,
 or via ssh ideally) and be presented with the option of mounting said directory
 and asked for a passphrase, then the directory gets mounted.       I took a look at Blaze's CFS, but he mentions that it is really only for  a single user system, and well <looks sheepish I can't get it to compile  on my machine, so I can't really play with it on my end.       I would think that this would be fairly difficult, otherwise it would  have already been done right?       Or am I missing something more basic?       It would seem that running something like this would do 2 things.
      1) It would be much more difficult to prove that a service provider          knew what files a user was keeping lying around because unless
         the user was logged in, not even the Sysadmin could "peek" at the
         files.
      2) Provide the user with greater privacy. Users could keep PGP keys          on the system without much risk, and as long as access was either
         thru the console, or thru something like ssh, you should be rather
         safe.        Is anyone working toward something like this? I kinda got the idea that
 CFS was more designed and intended for single-user-at-a-time systems, but the
 application I had in mind was more of a (old) C2-type organization.  Petro, Christopher C.

Umm, I guess you could make mount setuid root or something. Is this
just a linux thing? But wait, there's more.  There's nothing to prevent root from grabbing your password when you
log in. Root can see *everything.*
If a user on the system has your password, they can edit your .login
to give them your filesystem password. If they have the root password,
well, you're screwed.
AKAIK, the only benefit od encrypted drives is that the sysadmin
cannot be forced to reveal the contents of the drive (5th amendment
and all). You could do the same thing on a multiuser system by having
one encrypted partition, and making symlinks from each user's
directory to their directy in the encrypted drive. This would be a bit
more efficient, I think.

Nope, you have to make your own. The Kit is mostly Education, which
is available to all.      It would not be censorship, it would be Conspiracy to murder (I believe, the Legal types could give you the proper charge) on Vulis's part,
and attempted murder on the Hit Man's part.      That is NOT censorship. A rake is not a shovel, you can dig with it,
but that doesn't make it a shovel. It simply isn't.      Red Herring. Gilmore never claimed ownership over anyones writing, nor did he even make the claim that Vulis didn't have the right to say what he said, all he "claimed" (note quotes) was that Vulis wasn't welcome to say it here.      I don't buy it.
     Not yet.      Wether he makes money off it or not is irrelevant.      As the poets who send their drivel/art to a poetry mag. are the WRITERS of that magazine.      This doesn't make sense.      Setting up an entire Offset Web Press is difficult, setting up a press that will print on boxes and shit is not easy. Setting up a small hand operated press isn't that difficult. Note, I didn't say build, I just said set up. I have, in the past run a Vandercook Universal,
a small letter press. These are available used at very low costs by hobbyists all over America, and probably other parts of the world. Ture
your output is limited to what you can crank thru the press, but this
is just an example.     As I noted somewhere else, there are always Photocopiers, and small presses will never go away, there just is too much market for short
run stuff that the boys with the big presses don't want to deal with.      Very few of the people on this list were "invited" most simply wandered in.
     Try this, organize a small "open meeting" of around 1500 to 2000
people. Show up, act like a fucking drunk, scream rude and untrue things

Third Largest != third most significant force. Most people who vote Perot are either Repubs or Democrats, not "Reform Party" members.      In the 2000 election, were there are no incumbents, Perot's numers
will be about the same as the Libertarians, and if Perot doesn't make the ballot (either death or too sick) the reform party won't even be on the map.
     Perot doesn't have that many supporters, just more people who have heard of him, so when they get to the Voting Booth, they looked an Clinton and almost threw up, then looked at Dole, but couldn't get their hand to their nose, so they punched the next name they

@_subject: Crypto Bounties: Another Thought that crossed my mind. 
Here we go again:
      There are is a lot of software that we would all like to see
developed and deployed right?       There are a lot of people out there who write code, sometimes even freely redistributable code, but they have to eat, and get their
net access right?      Well, I was thinking, what if a "Crypto Software Bounty Server"
were set up, so that someone could propose a tool that they would like to see, along with an initial bounty. Others could contribute toward that
bounty (anonymously if they wish) until either the tool was delivered.
     The original issuer sets standards for the software (i.e. "easy to
use interface to mixmaster remailers for Macintosh", then must define
easy to use; Software considered delivered when in [alpha beta late-beta &etc.]). The first to present software meeting these qualifications gets the bounty, with the caviate that the software must be either gnu-copylefted,
or some similar "free use" copyright, after all, "The Net" paid for it...
     Some of the problems (and potential solutions) I can think of in this:
     1) Refusing to honor the contract--Maybe when a project is proposed,
        some other people (for a small percentage of the total) sign on
        as judges. When they feel that it reached the stated goal, then
        it is done. -Or- Money put up is non-refundable, and the bounty
        stays in the "bank" until claimed.      2) If the money stays in the bank until claimed, people might not         put up that much (or enough) to make a specific project worthwile--
        This could be solved by allowing the "bounty" to lapse in one         of 3 ways:
        A)  length of time after the initial proposal (bad because            i) someone could already be working on it; ii) bad because
           other people might add to the bounty, so a potential programmer
           might not start until the "pot" has grown to a certain level.
        B)  length of time after the last addition to the bounty,
           bad for both i & ii above.            These can both be gotten around (and other problems) by allowing
           programmers to "register" with the service that they are working            on a project (either anonymous registery, so that people will            still contribute to the project, or list those registered so            that people know [if who] someone is working on it)
     3) Funding: The server (in both the machine and the organizational sense)
        could be funded by:
        A) Interest on the money accumulated.
        B) A percentage of the bounty (say 10%)         C) Both A & B.  Has anything like this been proposed before? I know that the FSF (IIRC) accepts
contributions, but I am thinking of something more targeted, more "market driven" if you will. This could be expanded to non-crypto software as well, just think, if half the X Window users ponied up $5 a peice for a "good, easy to use non-motif
word processor", how long do you think it would take for someone to start coding a MS Word killer? Petro, Christopher C.

Correct term, but not necessarily accurate.      Not necessarily. It could be set up to keep the Bounty open, to provide
a revenue stream for upgrades, or second, third & etc. bounties for upgrades
bug fixes and new features.      Reputation could also eleminate the need for judges. If Matt Blaze, or Randall S. were to try to claim a specific bounty, people would be more likely to accept their claim than if I were to do so.     If it is GNU'd, then there is no one to buy out. I like the idea of "free" software. As it stands now, there is a lot of very high quality software free software out there (hell, all of the software I use _daily_
is "free" software), and if no one owns it, the government can't use copyright laws to restrict it. The feds _can't_ buy it out for a million dollars.      The other thing about the "bounty server" is that it is simpler to
set up (at least as far as I can see) than your contract model.      All you would need is to settle up the details, set up a web server
with the ability to handle ecash, and some sort of accounting and you are
off. Maybe, just to prove you are legit, a performance bond. Petro, Christopher C.

would not have been able to grow or get started. They produce _jobs_ which is more that can be said of your average machine-punch operator.      CEO's produce decesions(sp?).

@_subject: Bountyserver Round2 
Thank you all for you comments and input. I am in the process of rewriting
the propsal to make things clearer, and to revise some of the procedures. The original draft will, and the revision will be up at  by the time most of you get this.
I am making a single reply, rather than one at a time to save time and bandwidth. I wrote these replies before I started working on the revisions
to the proposal, so things might have changed a bit.       Yes. It is going to be web based, with (hopefully) email and Usenet      I am planning on using Apache-SSL or Stronghold, if I can afford it, with
Linux as the underlying OS. I plan on disabling telnet access as soon as the
server starts accepting credit card numbers. Anyone who then need shell access
will have to use SSH.      Software is my main objective, and software is easier.       Yeah. There is that. The other technologies I was thinking of were more
in the realm of algorythms and protocals rather than hardware. Hardware is possible, but difficult, and may (would) be better suited to Ian's proposal.
    Prozactly.      I understand that. If you are willing, I will ask for your opnion on the      I don't really understand this. I plan on spreading the word as far as possible, but if I only post information in one or two places, isn't that my choice? If I am tryind to hire someone am I required to place adds everywhere I can, or can I choose my medium?      I wasn't refering to the amount, but rather ecash being not-relevant AT THIS POINT  Not many people have ecash accounts, so it isn't a priority. It would be nice tho'.
     As to the amount: It really doesn't matter, but I am thinking of making
a minium of $5, just because anything less really isn't worth the book keeping,
but I really haven't made up my mind.      Archival copies are for legal reasons. Copyrighted material other than
that uploaded by the authors is not going to be allowed, and part of the agreement is that they allow the Server to keep a copy for historical/legal reasons.      I will have the name of the submitter, and I will make a "good faith" effort to detect copyrights. I think that is enough. I don't (in fact I doubt any one person does) have enough knowlege to know
every peice of software out there. I am more worried about people decompiling commercial products.     I am hoping that reputations will handle this.          I disagree. The iniator (hence forth known as Alice) is establishing the rules, it is up to that person to set forth the conditions. If the writer doesn't like it, they don't write it, and Alice looses her money.
If enough people add to the pot, someone will bite, and Alice gets what
Alice wants.       To keep Alice from reniging once the money is given, it is gone. It means that you have the choice of software or nothing.       20% is an 18% penalty for not Copylefting the software. It means that
I am going thru a lot of work, and not getting what I want, so I am going to get something. I want this server to produce Free Software.
     You are probably right. I really want to charge each equally.      Fine.       Thanks.      Soemthing like that.      I think "pay for" might be a little strong a word. "Assist" is more accurate.       If I can find good working defininations (sp?) I will use them. Otherwise
I will insist that Alice document what it wants.      March of Dimes, NORML, NRA, ACLU, GNU Foundation, FSF, SPLC.       As the time gets closer this will get more exact.      Automated positing to relevant newsgroups, and maybe a mail list for those interested.      Ok. Peter Allan:
I know, Spell Check.      That is life. First to market means a lot. Look at Lotus.
     I am contemplating adding in a place for developers to meet and collaborate, sharing the bounty.      He get a VC or two and goes commercial.
     This is Alices responcibility.      Good point. Solututions?      Keeps them from reniging (sp?) on the bid.      If I don't keep the inertia up, I will never get it done.      As I pointed out in private email, I think our model serves different objectives.      I will do that.        Think if it as a bet. Kinda like Mr. Bells AP proposal, Alice is betting that the software _won't_ get written. Once the bet is high enough,
it _will_ get written.      I am going to try to keep it simple, and let the thing evolve as necessary. As Alex (a former reader of this list) put it, the first anonymous
remailer was a perl hack done in an afternoon, and improvements came from that.
     Things will improve as needed, I am just trying to think things out
as thoroughly as possible first.      What do you have against "copylefted" software? Is it the specific GNU copyleft, or the concept?      1) As a junior programmer, you take on simpler bounties first.
     2) Team up with a more advanced programmer, pool efforts and split         the bounty.      It isn't intended to solve all problems, just some.     Yours seems suited for longer and more involved tasks. Mine to shorter.
    It might be more efficient to have a "paid" staff to evaluate the product to make sure it meets the specs. I don't have the funds to set up that infrastructure.      I am hoping that it doesn't come up too much. Honesty and reputation
should help.     You are starting with the software, and then figuring out the rest. I am doing it the other way.      I don't think that the two proposals will necessarily compete.      Financing?
     Ok. I will put up examples of each, and let Alice choose.      True.      I am thinking either 2 years after initial, or 12 months after last contribution, With a 1 year one time extension if someone claims to be "working
on it".      I am hoping that reputation and the threat of adjudication will prevent it from happening.      That is one area that does need work tho'. Jim Cook:
I don't like this way of picking a winner ... because I think it would
encourage fast and dirty work ... instead of quality ... better I think
would be a process analogous to peer review for grants and publications ...
with the added feature that the submission of a product is announced ... so
that competitors who are almost done can get their entry in also ... and the
initiators can evaluate several products simultaneously
My reply:
     In a way it _does_ encourage quick and dirty work, like the first cpunks remailer, hacked together in an afternoon, then came the rest.      It is a way to get _more_ software out there, hopefully some of it will be good, some bad. It really can't be much worse than the dreck comming out of some of the commercial houses.       I am thinking of a way of implementing checks tho'.

"bad", but rather that a nation should have a common base set of values
to avoid just the kind of fractionalization that we see occuring right now.

     Well, I can't speak for Brooklyn, but having just come back from trip thru the south (Tn. Ms. Ga. Al. Fl.) I can say that their accents are
as thick as a brick.
     Deeper into the gutter.
     The cultural differences in Europe are minor compared to the differences
between European and Asian for instance.
     Think of it like Operating Systems. Germany is like SCO, France is AT&T,
Italy is BSD, China is Vax/VMS. Turkey is Dos/Windows (well, things do blow up
a lot there...), Libya is running CM/VMS on an 3090. Iran is using OS/2 v1.       Yes, there are differences between Germanic and French culture, but no where near the difference that exists between French and Libyain.      Do you live in a large city? Tell you what, Next time you are in chicago
let me know, and I'll introduce you to my wife. Her mother was born in poland.
My wife speaks standard middle class english. I'll introduce you to her cousins
children, their father _still_ has trouble speaking english, yet the children
speak standard english, as well as polish. They speak english with almost no
accent. Next we'll take a trip to the barrio, and interview as many children
as we can find. Want to take bets on how many hispanic children so as well? Hell, those kids (wife's family) go to a neighborhood Catholic School that is mixed polish and hispanic--the polish kids ALL learn english as a primary
language (well, almost all) where the hispanic children learn it as a secondary
language.      Now, I have met hispanic people who do speak good english, but they--or
at least their parents--made a commitment to being _american_ rather than expatriots waiting to go "home".
     Or the vocal segment who claims that they should have to "give up their
cultural heritage" to "fit in with the rest of society". In cities with large hispanic populations sometimes third and fourth generations speak heavily accented spanglish.

     He did. More of a reference than is usually found on this list.      How does that disenfrachise people? It just says that if you want to
vote (intelligently is left out) you have to have passable english language
skills. It is already the case that you must have these skills to vote with any sort of integrity. Most of the debate on national and state issues
is conducted in english--in the papers, on radio and tv (what debate there is--your franchise means less than ever when your choices are reduced)--if you can't understand the debate, how can you pick a side? (o.b. crypto--
RNG simulating a coin toss?)
     Division of the "masses" into groups that can be played off one another.
     Less competition at the upper levels for them and their children (who you can be sure don't attend public schools).     (Ok, never attribute to malice what you can attribute to stupidity so--)
    It is even possible that these people truely believe that what they are doing is ethically correct, that they truely believe that American culture is evil, and that it needs to be changed or destroyed. I would go so far as to agree with them. I just don't think they are heading in the right direction.
     Yup. Preach it brother.
     Then how do you explain the shit shoveled out of D.C. (and other National Capitols) on a regular basis?      No, they haven't.      These days Columbus _is_ treated to loathing and condemnation. Kids are taught that he treated people like slaves--and not taught that this
was common in his time. That he "plundered" the "new world", and not taught
a damn thing about the historical context that this "plundering" took place in.      Which part? In the last two colleges that I attended there were "Black" studies (later renamed to "Africa-America") and _some_ Chinese
(at the last college there was also "latino") In the case of the "latino" and "Black" or "African American" it was more a study of that those two groups
accomplished _here in america_ than in their "home lands". I should note that the last school I attened was an Art School, and these "muti-cultural" classes
were taught from the Art History prespective. And yes, there was (IME) a bit of white male bashing in many of the courses.      Look at the fight surrounding Proposition 209 in california. The claim has been made that it is unconstitutional because it seeks to prevent ANY bias in either direction in the basis of race. The "minority"
"leaders" are the ones seeking to prevent it's enactment.       Are they studied to the depth that they were before?       I doubt it.     Wether you like it or not, wether you acknowlege it or not, a second
rate bullshit artist from the 1400's _has_ worked to shape the character
of English Culture, and hence to a lesser degree American culture. Shakespear
basically invented the Sit-com. Great huh?
      You know what many black peoples objection to Clarence Thomas was?       That he was "In the House".     It does it just as much as European history.

     With certain versions of PGP (or rather with non-us versions of certain

pre-ascii armor version of it. I looked thru it, and no obvious patterns were there.
    PGP must use a pretty good compression algorythm(sp?) since the gzip of
the A's file is only about 13 bytes longer than the gzip version. A second pass of gzip gives me a file of 289 bytes.
    In fact, I would doubt that any half way decent encryption program _would

practice, there are numbers which you can't get with algorythms, but in theory you should be able to hit all real numbers of given granularity (i.e,
