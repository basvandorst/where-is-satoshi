I second that, but I didn't vote for clinton, I voted against
bush. I never (or very rarely) vote for anyone; I decide which
candidate that is likely to win I dislike most and vote for whoever is likeliest to beat them. a vote for anyone else is usually a vote
for the one I don't want to win. if clinton had been the one I disliked more than bush I would have
voted for bush, not perot.
if the republicans can manage to field someone I dislike less than
clinton in 96, I will vote for them. with his attacks on privacy and the second amendment, my dislike for clinton goes up every day.

there was a popular song in the (1910's? 1920's?) called 'the man who
broke the bank at monte carlo' and I do recall reading (in a book of
sports records of all places) that this was based on the exploits of a
real guy (the reason the tale appeared in a book of sports records was
because of the level of endurance the guy showed; he stayed at the table
18 - 24 hours a day while he was gambling). I don't recall any of the particulars, or how much he took from the casino (and was it roulette or
baccarat?), or even his name but I am pretty sure this was a true story.

I don't see any reason why sgt. harlow shouldn't be as welcome
as anyone else on the list. there are a large number of people
in the military, and any generalization drawn about them is
likely to be false (of course all generalizations are false, but
that is another matter). for those who enjoy paranoia, I would
point out that sgt. harlow is not the only person on this list with past or present military associations.
