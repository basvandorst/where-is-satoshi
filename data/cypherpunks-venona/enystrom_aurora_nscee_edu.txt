Toto hints at some issues here that I've been wondering about for a while now.  What are some effective strategies for securely introducing "newbies" to the world of cryptography and anon remailers?  I'm currently attending college, which means that my peers all use email very regularly -- a ripe environment for use of cryptography in email, I should think.  However, nearly everyone's email accounts are on a central Unix machine, which brings up many issues about the (lack of) security of private keys on multiuser machines.
My question is this -- is it better for the crypto community in the long run to have more people using encryption, but perhaps insecurely, or to have fewer users whose communications are more cryptographically secure?
Thus the time may have come to abandon the cool, measured language of
technical reports -- all that talk of "perturbations" and "surprises" and
"unanticipated events" -- and simply blurt out: "Holy shit!  Ten thousand
years!  That's incredible!"

It's absolutely true that nothing on a centralized Unix machine is truly secure.  However, is abandoning all pretenses of crypto and security in favor of holding out for a utopian ideal really the best solution?  Does using encryption for email on multiuser machines actually hurt the cause of the security community in the long run?
(I'm not asking rhetorical questions here -- I'm truly looking for some thoughts on this.)

Do you do consulting work for a specific audience that would be inclined to need to use remailers and encryption more than the average user, or are you referring more to just "average" friends?  If it is the second case, especially, I think that many of us might benefit from some specific scenarios in which you proposed encryption and remailers as solutions. What programs do you usually suggest?  On my Linux box, I use pine 3.95's filter hooks to use PGP relatively seamlessly, but the multiuser system that most of my peers use email on does not have a version of pine capable of supporting filters.  I've looked into Raph's premail, and have set it up successfully, but it seems a bit obtuse for a normal user.  (Plus I *REALLY* don't like the idea of storing my passphrase on the multiuser system as well.)
This brings up an interesting point -- should we crypto users try and work with the system administrators to get PGP set up systemwide, or should we just try to do it on our own, as unobtrusively as possible?  A systemwide implimentation of PGP would probably be advantageous, but to ask for that certainly risks bringing attention to otherwise unobtrusive activities that the system administrators might not like.

That makes a lot of sense for data security in the general sense, but I'm uncertain how useful that would be in terms of helping the user have more secure email.  Is there an offline mail reader for standard Unix systems that would run on a platform like you describe?  Thus the time may have come to abandon the cool, measured language of

Okay, what is it, what are the requirements, where do I find it, does it require special Unix software (and if so, what is that, and where do I find it too)?
