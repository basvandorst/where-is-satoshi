The ACK process and the allocation process are separate, and should remain so.  They run on different servers, and they run as separate processes in the unix version of brloop.  A little tweaking of brloop could allow pre-fetching of the next segment to search, without any effect on the ACK process.  I dislike the idea of a client sending an ACK before it has searched the entire segment.

When the list was discussing "key as final authority" a while back,
Wei Dai posted (on May 31) a program called 'addid' which allows one
to add arbitrary strings as user IDs on other peoples' pgp keys.
These appear just as though PGP had added them itself, and are signable
and displayable by regular old PGP.
As an exercise, I grabbed Hal's "insecure key" from the keyserver,
and used 'addid' to add a new ID to it, which I then signed.
Here's the output of 'pgp -kc 0xcbd301':

} } I, of course, know of the "dislike" of GAK here.

You leave out something here when you say `the judge "cheating"'.
Most of the proposals and draft legislation include words like
"or by other lawful authority" along with the provisions empowering
judges to grant access to keys.  Some versions will list various combinations of the Attorney General, Director of {TLA}, etc, as
explicitly empowered.  Other versions don't explicate the phrase,
perhaps trusting that those with the need will already know where
their lawful authority lies -- maybe in an anti-terrorist Executive
Order; maybe in legislation authorizing military support in drug
interdiction; perhaps in their organization's charter to protect
"national security".
Part of the concern is that spooks will have routine access to keys
without any cheating -- no stealing or bent judges will be required.
The War on Drugs, the War on Firearms, the War on Terrorists
(on Money Lauderers, on Pedophiles, on Spies) are just too important.
} In other words ... if it took agreement by a review board composed of } non-LEA members of this list, would the escrow be acceptable??
This would not be acceptable to the government.  Very many sincere,
patriotic government agents believe they currently have the right and the responsibility to monitor the civilians' possibly-illegal activities.  Your hypothetical review board of cypherpunks would unacceptably limit their established right to gather evidence and
intelligence.  Investigations too sensitive to mention here, would
be crippled.  Unless of course, you intended that "or by other lawful
authority" would be included in your scheme?

@_subject: Coding || Politics || Diplomacy (was: Radical Roots) 
I saw a part of the PBS VietNam documentary last night, a (North)
Vietnamese general explaining that their defense against the folks with
helicopters was successful because it was never a purely military
strategy, instead always combining the political, the diplomatic and
the military.
What does this have to do with cypherpunks ?   A lot.
The recent unpleasantness in Washington, and Brussels, and London
has inspired many reminders that "Cypherpunks Write Code".
Amen to that -- and we clearly must hurry up and write more code now.
But we can and should do more.
We have long foreseen that the various Horsemen of the Apocalypse would be
used in the sound bite campaign to manufacture support for restrictions on
crypto.  No surprise then that we see this happening.  But there is still
time in this part of the battle, and an encouraging ripple effect of some
of our own political memes.  Many people in the US still remember the
abuses of J. Edgar Hoover, of Richard Nixon, or even Clinton's recent
abuse of FBI files; and these abuses are often mentioned along with the
lowest common denominator explanations of GAK in the mainstream media.
Much of the public in the Western Democracies retains a fuzzy belief in
freedom and privacy, and a fuzzy skepticism of Big Brother.
This is the political part of the battle, and the ranks of cypherpunks
include many people with skills in creating memes and sound bites.  Some
of these may not be coders at all, but they can contribute to the overall
strategy by inserting our own memes into the public's consciousness.  We
may not "win" on the political front alone, but even if the only
accomplishment is to delay the inevitable, this is very good in that it
allows the coders more time to write code.  Such effort is also rewarded
as it allows additional intelligent people to understand the issues and to
join us.  Cypherpunks write memes!
Finally, I will touch briefly on the dirtiest part of the effort -- the
diplomatic.  This has been discussed at length on this list and elsewhere.
The efforts by those who lobby and arm-twist and broker deals in
Washington, Brussels, London, and other nodes of power, may also
contribute to the overall strategy.  Again, we clearly will never "win"
outright in any such endeavors.  But I think it is clear that we again
gain time, breathing room, from such efforts -- time in which we may write
more code and write more memes.  If the lawmakers only hear from the
spooks and the secret police, they will pass their bad laws much sooner.
