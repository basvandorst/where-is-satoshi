   Now if the bank allows this exchange of old coins for new coins to be
   done over an anonymous network (e.g., a remailer-net), then the system is
   anonymous as long as you don't move physical money in or out of the system.
   Maintaining anonymity when moving physical money in and out of the system is
   what blinding helps you to do, but this will be less useful in a fully
   digital economy where such movement will be infrequent.
