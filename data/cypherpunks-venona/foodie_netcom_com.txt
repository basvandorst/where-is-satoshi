Bear with me, all. I am on my first cup of coffee.
Well, I do have qualms about this, but I am assuming/hoping
the original poster doesn't know what they are doing and
wanted an answer like "Look in resource  dood" (call
me a bleeding heart). Norton Encrypt for the Mac does have
major problems.  Key handling is botched such that the
keyspace is significantly less than the full 56 bits specified,
through what looks like a combination of inept implementation
and perhaps outright bugs. I don't remember all the details,
but I think NE converts to all lower case or some such, and
discards anything past 8 characters of passphrase. There is
a file on one of the crypto sites about NE. I would direct
anyone interested to dig around some.

This is, of course, very good advice.
Passphrases need only be as strong as every other component of the security
system. I'd add that there is a moderately good reason to keep the passphrase
_only_ as strong as every other component of the system for psychological
The passphrase is what the user tends to think of when they think of their
system. Even if that user is the designer of the system, a false sense of
security an be an easy thing to develop. At a past place-of-work, someone
there who prided themselves on using difficult passphrases was bitten pretty
severely by a faulty .forward file.
DES provides similar lessons - searching 56 bits of keyspace requires just
barely less effort than that required to launch other attacks on the algorithm
(in theory, at least). The system is, as far as anybody knows, secure, and no
part of it is significantly more secure than any other.

A "Superlab" linking the computational resources of four national laboratories
has come a big step toward becoming a reality with the opening of SecureNet --
a network for transmitting secret and classified data over the Internet. Bing
Young, who led the Lab's part in the project, says the new network is still
only a "dirt road" able to transmit data at 1.5 megabits/second. However, he
says new encryption technologies will bring the network up to information
superhighway speeds over the next year.
Young will discuss SecureNet in a presentation at 10 a.m., Wednesday, April

Connected Corporation announced DataSafe, a Mac/Windows web based
backup service.
$14.95/Month for 50MB, archival CD-ROM for $24.95 each.
Offers passwords and DES encryption. Storage is on 2 mirrored
Phone # (508) 270-0035, DataSafe uses the federally approved Data Encryption Standard (DES) with a
56-bit key to encrypt
all of your data before it leaves your PC. This level of encryption is so
powerful, it is not permitted
to be exported outside of the United States (we use a different, but
similarly powerful encryption
scheme for our international customers). You have the option to choose your
own encryption
password, which is never transferred to us over the modem. In this way, no
one but you can read
your data - not when it is in transfer to us, nor when it is being stored
in encrypted format at our
secure operations centers. When this level of encryption is combined with
the fact that we only
transmit the portions of each file that change every day, not the entire
file, the chances that anyone
will be able to read or make use of your data as it travels over the
network are practically eliminated.
DataSafe uses the TCP/IP communications protocol for both its private
dial-up network and
Internet-based services.
I really like the idea of distributed, encrypted backups, but
this strikes me as the kind of thing that has the potential to
get a lot of gullible people in trouble.
Hopefully someone offshore with proven security and a wider choice
of algorithms will compete...

@_subject: Re: Usenet and Re: extortion via digital cash 
IMHO, it will end up similar to the late night infomerical spots on TV.
Not puch of value there, but bored people will still look.
Any effort to regulate it will come from a tangent; IDs of some sort
to post in public, or have access to the net, or screening it out of
the hypothetical InfoBahn II networks,  or similar.
Would the concept of moderated forum have to go away, too? People could
look for messages signed by the moderator, but the overhead inherent in
validating keys could make that unusable.
The transition would be messy, once (if) two parallel systems were in
place. Many people using the new system would start tagging messages
with newsgroup names, of course, but the breakdown effect of lots of
people posting messages that seem to go straight to the void would have
a negative impact on the whole thing.
Something similar to the namespace pollution problem large companies
see with resumes would also start to happen, only in a much more
shameless form (Spam, the Next Generation).
Once enough specific search terms emerged as coherent analogues to
groups, this might be functional, though.
I'm interested. I see a lot of problems, though, with implementation
details, especially while both the old and the new exsist side by side.
Something more akin to _Islands In The Net_ style data havens seems more
workable, but with obvious disadvantages...

I can provide a datapoint here. I started getting into chemistry
when I was about 8, which was in 1981. I can't remember the brand
name, but my first (and last, actually) 'value-added' kit was
designed to keep kids from doing anything that could be
dangerous, a fact tactfully explained on the packaging.
To solve that problem, my mother gave me an Edmund Scientific
catalog and a (severely limited, given my family background)
budget for whatever I wanted.
I ordered direct for supplies from then on.
I would have killed for a computer growing up. I finally got one,
a Mac IIsi, when I went to college (I'm still paying off the
loan I took out to buy it. I gave it to someone when I got another
machine, and it will, if I'm not mistaken, retrieve this message
the next time a certain someone checks mail. That helps
me overlook the fact that I still owe more than the machine
is worth... I learned my lesson.)

I know this has been discussed multiple times, but
archive searching has turned up nothing.
What freely available tools are there for securely

Ideally, I'm looking for a free space wiper, along the lines
of what Burn 2.4 on the Mac can do.
As in, create a file the size of available free space, and then
write garbage repeatedly to that file.
I've found "Real Deal", a TSR that intercepts the DEL command,
but that's a poor substitute, at least for my needs.
Anyway, thanks.

No such constraint in the _making_ of laws, of course. We have
laws on the books forbidding the utterance of "Oh boy", the carrying
of an ice cream cone in one's pocket, and the act of driving without
insurance, all functioning to varying degrees of effectiveness, 'on

The question Sandy seems to me to be raising is not whether a group
of people can issue a decree, but rather whether the interaction of the law
books, the interested parties on either side of the debate, and the mostly
disinterested real world will intersect such that the laws passed can
be used to effectively hamper the activities of the parties who wish
to go about the business proscribed. This is not an either/or question,
as you so aptly note (I hope Kirkegaard doesn't mind).
