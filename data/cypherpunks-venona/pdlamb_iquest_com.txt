(bunch of stuff deleted)
Is this asking the question, "Does DES form a group with IDEA?"  (Substitute
your favorite cipher.)  Since it took about 15 years to figure out DES is
_not_ a group, I suspect it will take a long time to figure out the answer
to that question for each pair of ciphers you're going to substitute.
Seems to me it's a good basic idea.  If it costs, for example, a million
bucks to crack a cipher; you have three ciphers that can be used; then the
best-case cost to crack a message just tripled!  Of course, if you choose
two ciphers stronger than DES, it probably went up a little more (g).
If the ciphers don't form a group, you just made your system unbreakable.
Just use two ciphers.  Then a brute-force attacker has to check each key for
each cipher once when it is applied first, and once for each of the possible
keys for the other cipher when it is applied second!
Sounds too good to be true.  Am I missing something?

How about an obvious solution, like the password feature on After Dark?  If
I remember correctly, there's a hot-key combination you can use to bring up
the screen saver mode immediately as you get up from the machine.  It's
obviously not foolproof, but just blanking the screen and going into a
password mode would probably deter the casual browser.  If you're really
worried, change your autoexec so it goes into windows and starts AD immediately.
Low tech, maybe, but easy!

HotJAVA apparently doesn't suffer from this bug, at least the 1.03 Alpha NT
version.  On the other hand, HotJava does truncate the URL to fit in its
window.  (I suppose I could try a very large screen with a very small font,
just to make sure -- anyone willing to donate a 19" screen or bigger?)

Give it a rest, Doc.  You give all the rest of us Ph.D.'s a bad rep with
this crap.  Of course, if you went to that 4-year vocational school to get
an M.D., I guess that's understandable.
If you are so illiterate that you can't read the ascription (it says right
up there, "said Mike Homer, Netscape's vice president of marketing"), then
why do you (a) waste bandwidth and our time to go through this drivel, and
(b) flame one Netscape employee for not knowing everything you know?  If
there are all of 5+ refereed publications in this area, how about giving
references?  It would take up less space than your recurring venom eruption!
Or couldn't you understand the papers, given that you couldn't understand
the news clip...

...remainder of ad elided
Is it just me, or does this sound like a commercial version of SATAN?  I
wonder what makes SATAN unacceptable (besides the name) while something like
this is apparently acceptable?

Does this mean RSADSI is claiming copyright infringement on the RC2 source code?
