@_subject: pgp.el, as shown at the last PhysMeet 
At this weekend's Physical Meeting, I demonstrated pgp.el, an
interface to PGP for use from GNU Emacs.  As I mentioned, this
package is available from the standard Emacs lisp archives and
other places.  However, the version I showed is advanced beyond
those sites, most notably in the use of color to highlight
various PGP messages, and in the "transparent decryption"
feature that I talked about the most.
If you'd like to look over this latest version, you can snarf it
This version is still under test and development (notably, I
want to get the transparency working for rmail as well as mh-e,
and for sending as well as receiving).  Because it's not
finished yet, I've put it in the private/ directory, which is
protected against browsing.  When that's all finished, I'll be
publishing it again in the usual places.

But electronic computers are good at checking out these kinds of
  chains automatically.
Not that good.  Loss of connectivity, limited bandwidth, and
cumulative table size would all make this impractical very
quickly, I think.

Has anyone yet discovered the secret reformatting necessary to
make Phil Dubois' signature check on that message?  The usual
trick of pulling all the paragraphs up onto one line wasn't

In a November letter to committee members, the NSA
        threatened to prevent the export of triple- DES, citing
        existing US law and potential threats to national
        security (see attached NSA letter).
Oh, no, surely not.  There must be some misunderstanding here -
they *promised* they wouldn't block export of non-Clipper
things.  They wouldn't lie!
