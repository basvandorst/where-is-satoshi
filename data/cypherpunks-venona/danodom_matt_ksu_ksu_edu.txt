L. Detweiler Said:
I don't know if this is what you were asking, but:
The LPF is very strongly against the SPI, and requests that people
refrain from providing it with ANY information that might assist it in
building a database containing software patent information.  This
database, whatever its intended use may be, can assist
leeches^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hlawyers in building bulletproof software patents
by making information on prior art available to them.  It will have a
user interface in the same style as LEXIS/NEXUS (sp?), and that
suggests that it is inteded for the lawyers rather than for us (no
offense intended to Mike).

George A. Gleason Said:
That is not a bad idea, and I would trust certain people to tell the
truth about ViaCrypt PGP's security....  the problem is convincing
ViaCrypt to let someone that Cypherpunks consider trustworthy to look
at it.  I mean, I wouldn't listen to Sternlight or Denning, but I
might listen to May or Gilmore.  But would ViaCrypt allow May or
Gilmore to see their source?

Steve Davis Said:
RSAREF is available, but you can't use it in commercial products.
Also, it doesn't have many 'toys', although I can't really figure out
what 'toys' are needed...
If you don't need public-key algorithms (doesn't PKP claim patent
rights on _all_ public key systems?), IDEA may be used for
non-commercial purposes; IDEA is also fairly fast.

[Much deleted from the below quotes]
I would love to write pages about how Apple used to supply ROM code
for free with its machines and now sends the FBI after people who
simply get portions of their code, or about how they 'went corporate'
and betrayed all of the people who were loyal throughout the Steve^2 era,
but instead I'll say:
Please don't argue about this here.  It may have some relevance to
Cypherpunks, but it is an emotionally charged issue and neither side
will ever convert the other; this will just degenerate in to a
mindless flame war, getting nowhere fast.  Don't flood the list.
If you do decide to continue this, keep using anonymous remailers;
Strat is vicious when he's pissed, just ask Dave.

Ed Carp Said:
Is this just for RSA, or for all patents?  If PKP wanted to forbid
academic use of RSA (or require a license for it), could they legally
do so?  Assume for now that the patent is valid, which it may not
I ask all this because I often hear researchers looking for a cure for
(insert your favorite aliment here) complain that they have to pay
patent royalties on the gentically-modified animals they use in their
work, and if, say, two patented rabbits produce offspring, they
have to pay royalties on each of the offspring as well.  This is
academic use (to me anyway; I don't know about legally), but requires

@_subject: IDEA implementation 
With all this talk about various libraries going on, I figure I might
as well ask this:
Is there an implementation of IDEA that will let me do something like
encryptedbuf = encypher (databuf, buflen, passphrase);
Where the arguments mean the obvious, and databuf can be of arbitrary
If not, I may do it, but I wouldn't want to duplicate efforts :-)
