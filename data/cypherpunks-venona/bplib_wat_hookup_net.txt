mathematics behind cyphers. I write a weekly column about computers and
the Internet in a small town newspaper in Brantford Ontario. I was
particularly interested in the SSL crack that took place recently and I
wrote an article about the feat and talked about some of the implications
of this use of the Internet. strong, cryptography to both protect personal privacy and to aid secure
business communications. I have been following the debate about a Cypherpunk spokesperson with some interest and I thought that I would throw in my two cents worth (2.5 cents Canadian! :-})
to agree to a common cause or to allow one person to become a spokesman for the group. Such a position grants a certain amount of 'power', for lack of a better word, to such a person. I think that there is no need for such a person. Each of us has a different point of view that, while sharing some common ideas, cannot be reconciled with any 'official' position.
have no fear, the public is listening. I do, however, detect some small amount of smugness attached to comments about 'Joe Sixpack'. While it is true that the average citizen is not interested in esoteric subjects such as cryptography, do not underestimate the importance of communicating with them. Their votes and elected representatives will control the future legislation regarding cryptography. It is vital that they understand just what is at stake in this debate, and that they make decisions based upon knowledge and not upon fear.

Today we take up that thread and talk about the stuff of spy novels.Cryptography, in the context that we are discussing it, is a means of preventing unauthorized people from reading our files or correspondence. Cryptography is not new. It has been used throughout history and has played its part in shaping events. Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded because the cipher that she used to arrange a rebellion against Elizabeth I was decoded by the government. Caesar Cipher, to disguise his messages to Rome during his military campaigns. Every letter in his messages was replaced by the letter three letters farther in the alphabet. Thus A would become D, B would become E, until you reached the end of the alphabet. You would then wrap around to make X equal to A, Y equal to B and Z equal to C. In this way the word CAESAR would become FDHVDU. Simple substitution ciphers like this one are easily broken and today are used in puzzle books to provide a few moments diversion to puzzle fanciers. the early days of computers. One of the first computers was used to help decode enemy messages in England during the second world war. The 'boffins of Bletchley' were the true progenitors of the computer, not IBM. Caesar Cipher. Indeed, today's methods of encoding messages have progressed to the point where the ciphers are unbreakable within any reasonable amount of effort. It does no good to break a cipher if it takes 1500 years of computer time to do it! type of cryptography called Public Key Cryptography. With this method you have two keys, a public key and a private key. Simply speaking, a key is a very long number that is used by your program to encode and decode messages. Each person that you want to communicate with has a public key that is published and is known by everyone.  public key to encode the message. Your friend receives the message and uses his private key to decode the message. intercept the encoded message and the public key of the recipient, but he cannot use this information to decode the message without the secret key of the recipient. the recipient. The secret key could be intercepted and used to decode the messages. Public key systems require that only the public key be transmitted to the recipient. The message cannot be decoded using only the public key and the message. military grade cryptographic methods has generated considerable controversy. The US government has placed this software under export control and has suggested the use of their own system called Clipper.

As a Canadian, I am often astounded by the attempts of the United States government to apply American law extraterritorially. A case in point is the trade embargo with Cuba. Canada does not recognize this embargo and trades freely with Cuba. Several American corporations faced legal sanction in the U.S. for the actions of their Canadian subsiduries. I don't remember the details but can get references if anyone requires it.
ITAR regulations may be enforced by the U.S. government on the parent corporations if history is any judge.
In any case, these regulations are impeding standards development and the use of secure cryptography for commerce on the internet. As for key escrow and and other schemes to dilute security, no foreign company is going to use such 'bastardized' products, knowing that the U.S. government may be listening in. Especially since your president is talking about commercial spying.

           Microsoft(R) WinNews Electronic Newsletter
Here is some important information on Windows 95 that
may affect some of you.  Please make certain to read it.
UPDATED DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS 95 FILE AND PRINTER SHARING SECURITY ISSUE - October 20, 1995
Microsoft wants its customers to know that it has
discovered and fixed a potential security problem with file
and printer sharing in Windows 95.  Only customers who have
enabled file and printer sharing - a non-default option -
may have been at risk, and, to the best of our knowledge,
no users have been harmed.  Nevertheless, Microsoft
regards this potential problem with the greatest
seriousness and, we have worked hard over the past week to
resolve it.  Microsoft recommends customers using File and
Printer Sharing upgrade to the newer drivers.
How do I know if I am affected?
Only customers that use the File and Printer Sharing option
to share their files with other users on a network are
affected.  This option is not enabled by default so unless
you have manually enabled it, you are not affected by this
issue.  To determine if File and Printer Sharing is
enabled, choose the Networks Option in the Control Panel.
If file and printer sharing is enabled, you  will see
either "File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks"
or "File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks" in the
list of installed network components.
What are the issues? File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks
Microsoft was recently made aware of an issue with File
and Printer sharing for NetWare Networks which may affect
data security for corporate users.
Only users whose environments meet both of the following
conditions may be affected:
    1. They configure their machine to share files and
        printers with other users on the network using File
        and Printer Sharing for NetWare networks (This
        option is not turned on by default)
    2. They enable remote administration or install
        Microsoft Remote Registry Services  (These options
        are not turned on by default)
If your configuration matches that listed above, it is
possible for another user on the network to gain read-only
access to your machine after the administrator has logged
off the machine and until you restart your computer.  To
correct this problem, Microsoft has issued an updated
driver for File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks.
The updated driver ensures that only valid administrators
have access to the computer's drive.
File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks (not MSN:
    The Microsoft Network online service)
Microsoft is also issuing an update for a known problem
with File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks and a
certain UNIX shareware network client (Samba's SMBCLIENT).
The update corrects a problem with share-level security
documented in the Microsoft Knowledge Base on October 9th.
The update also includes a correction for a similar problem
with user-level security that Microsoft recently discovered
as part of its internal testing of the new driver.
Customers whose environments meet all of the conditions
below, may have their data susceptible to network or
Internet hackers:
    1. They configure their machine to share files and
        printers with other users on the network using File
        and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks (This
        option is not turned on by default)
    2. They share a LAN, Internet, or Dial-Up connection
        with a UNIX-based computer running Samba's
        SMBCLIENT software
    3. The network administrator does not disable peer
        services using System Policies
The Samba SMB client allows its users to send illegal
networking commands over the network. The Samba client is
the only known SMB client at this time that does not filter
out such illegal commands.  SMBCLIENT users do not
automatically have access to the Windows 95 drive, and
must know the exact steps to send these illegal commands.
The updated driver prevents these illegal commands from
being executed, preventing SMBCLIENT users from accessing
the drive on which sharing is enabled.  With the updated
driver, the SMBCLIENT user will only have access to those
shared folders that the Windows 95 user has designated.
How do I get the Updated Drivers?
(Please note that this only affects English language versions of Windows 95.) Both drivers are available for immediate download from the
Internet ( The Microsoft
Network online service, and is being made available to
other online services including CompuServe, America Online,
and Prodigy.  The updated drivers will also be mailed to
any user free of charge if they call Microsoft's FastTips
line, 800-936-4200, beginning Monday, October 23rd.
Microsoft is committed to providing safe connectivity
solutions for customers.  Microsoft takes this
responsibility seriously and has worked, and will continue
to work, with great speed to provide solutions for
customer issues.

@_subject: E-cash and Interest 
I had been doing some thinking about E-cash and some of the implications. It seems to me that there is another element in the discussion that has not gotten very much consideration.
When you have your money in the bank, you are earning interest on the money (albeit not very much! ) and that money continues to earn interest until it is withdrawn. If you write a check to pay for something, that ends your interest accumulation for that money. With the E-cash systems that I have seen, you generate your own E-cash and have it signed by a 'bank' At that moment, it becomes like cash in your wallet and you loose interest that this money could be earning.
Has this issue been addressed, or am I missing something?

I think that you have hit the nail on the head. Money could still 'earn' interest until it is spent. The 'bank' still has the 'real' money. In fact, it is an improvement over cash, in that you could still earn interest on the money on your hard drive.
Thanks for the clarification.

I guess that it would depend upon your definition of 'withdraw'. If you say that money is withdrawn when it is on your hard drive, what you say is true. However, if the money is 'withdrawn' when it is returned to the 'bank' for 'clearing it could still earn interest. Of course, this is predicated on an e-cash/check analogy that requires specific clearing. In any case, at some point, this stuff has to be turned into 'real money'.

It would be very hard to prevent the government keeping files on you. They have requirements such as tax collection etc that would require keeping files. What I would like to see is similar protection of my data that is stored on goverment computers. Should my information be released, the agency responsible should have to pay compensation. Such is the price of not keeping my information secret.
I agree that in the absolute sense, this is true. However, it is not practical to do so in our modern society. If you are prepared to live without credit or health insurance you can do this but the price is too high for most people to consider.

I wish that it could be dealt with in another way. If personal information is not controlled, it will work towards the detriment of the individual. My personal opinion is that the state exists to serve the individual, not to control him. In our current society an individual has little control over the release of personal data, therefore the state should legitimatly protect the individual. If you wish to control your own information, you must be prepared to be a real hard case.

I agree that this is a problem but I still feel that an individual should have more rights than a corporation. It is true that there is a possiblity of the owners of the corporation may have their rights diminished, but you have to balance this against the protection that they get by being incorporated. Either the files belong to the corporation or they belong to the owner or shareholders. If they belong to the corporation, the individual wins the rights contest. If I follow your scenario, one need only form a corporation to avoid responsibility for any violations of the law.
I wish to reiterate here and now, that I am NOT advocating government access to computers or files. I am simply suggesting that data corporations should be required to take responsibility for the data that is in their care. If they do not take such care, they should be subject to sanction.

not central to my argument. I was not "really" suggesting that only
corporations be included by this law. I do realise what a corporation is
and that some very small entities can be a corporation. me for one purpose, ie health care, hydro, internet provision, etc, should be required to keep this information confidential. If I detect a violation of this confidentiality, I should have an expectation of some legal recourse. Canadian eh) I should not expect to be on the mailing list of every
sporting goods operation in North America! I should be able to expect that my doctor's files on me will be kept confidential. This is certainly an area where you cannot provide false information as medical records must be accurate to provide for future care.
the bastards who violated my expectation of privacy.
Warm Regards,

Just what is this 'other matter'
in feedback on your system and want us to examine it and tell you of
weaknesses. We are interested in any new system that claims to be secure
and we can learn from the developments, and yes, mistakes of others.  This
sounds like a perfect quid pro quo to me. the cypherpunks to assist your marketing for whatever benefits that you
see by exploiting our name. I say again, as others have said, we are
simply a mailing list of people brought together by a common interest in
cryptography. There is nothing to stop you from making your claims without our 'consent' or the 'Cypherpunks seal of approval'.
people on this list who have expressed doubts about your system. These
people are well known to the press and in the security community and are
not shy about expressing their opinions (right Perry? ). These are the
people who you have to convince if you want to have our approval (whatever
that is).
secure. The code has been placed on the net for public comment and review. I think that all have benefited from this process.
samples of marketing 'noise' to the list using all of the keywords that we have come to regard as 'snake oil'. I have no idea if your product is indeed secure or snake oil. You have not published enough information for any reasonable  person to make a determination. The form of your announcement was not appropriate for this forum or your needs.
to sci.crypt and send a short note to this list asking for comments. People who ask for help, and co-operate with us usually receive help. People who publish marketing junk, as you did, get abused.

@_subject: Re: Internet Privacy Guaranteed ad (POTP Jr.) 
it is quite clear that without your publishing the algorithms for your
product, you have to accept our skepticism obout your claims. You have
offered to do this so I will wait to make my judgement. brought up by several posters to this thread. This issue has to do with
the fact that if you generate all of the keys (or whatever) what is to
stop someone from offering one of your employees a LARGE bribe to cough up
the keys? system, no matter how clever, that relies on a human factor. People are
weak, properly used, mathematics is not. To suggest that such a security
breach would not occur with your procedures is disingenuous in the
extreme. to learn more about your system before I pass judgement but I must tell
you, however, that I have heard nothing yet to give me any confidence that your system is secure. Tim Philp

I have just read your conditions for releasing the information tha the group felt was necessary to evaluate your product. A couple of comments.
First, the Cypherpunks are not an organized group who can agree to your conditions. This is simply a mailing list not a corporate entity to be contracted with. To attempt to treat them as such and to use their resources for your marketing gain is, in my opinion, less than honest. If the code has not been broken in 5 months, nothing will have been proved. A better model to follow would be that used (eventually) by Netscape. Release the code for comment and make changes based on weaknesses discovered by the group.
you not release the information to Canadians? It cannot be ITAR, because it does not apply to Canadians. How can you claim that the Cypherpunks failed to break your system if you exclude its most brilliant members! .

Has anyone had any experience with Instant Internt - a networking/firewall program? I have a client who is interested in this software and is concerned about security. I have little info other than sales noise and I would like an opinion from someone who has actually used it.

If I recall correctly, don't currency traders make REAL money by doing just that. By moving money into different currencys and taking advantage of minor fluctuations and differences in exchange rates at different exchanges, these traders sometimes make a LOT of REAL money. I am not sure, but I think that it is called arbitrage trading or something like that.
