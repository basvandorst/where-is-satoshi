Sorry I wasn't able obtain the original SUBJECT here.
     Through-out the moral existance of the internet I find no reason to stop the comunications. There are factors like no AT&T, MCI, or SPRINT (those dime-a-minute rates are
baffling). GOOD. Then there are more ideas exchanged. This
can be a PLUS for businesses that are RETAILERS (in the long run). The internet can be used to UNITE the world with a
single language. The internet can be used to share ideas,
learn, and a good place to visit when you are feeling down.     Now if you believe anything I said, than the idea that
the iternet brings is UNITY. Isn't it strange that within
the last 3 years, (taken from a local news channel) people
have agreed that the U.S. is moving in a positive direction? Not really, within these last three years is the exact time the internet had become most publicly available. With
PRODIGY, AOL, and COMPUSERVE making it happen. Who is the
original credit due to?
Tell me.
my favorite site:
on the internet today.

It is true, so many government sites have been hacked!
The FBI home page was replaced with SATANIC stuff. A picture of the upside down cross as a background and various other
changes regarding SATAN.
i think it's funny, but hey it's our own goverment. I wonder how often they check their sites. BTW, my friends site -
 has a link to the
FBI's MOST WANTED LIST. See if you are there!
