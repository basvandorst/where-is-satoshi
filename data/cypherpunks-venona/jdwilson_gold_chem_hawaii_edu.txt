Tim:  the MMPI has 600 questions, with approx 4x redundancy for indicators of

Check out IEEE Computer November 1993, V26, pp 76-78, wherein the Com-
mittee On Public Policy states, among other things, "Very serious consti-
tutional questions exist.  The government's key escrow initiative may violate
the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the US Bill of Rights"
"Better methods already exist...Moreover, encryption software (including
DES and RSA algorighms and the user-ready and popular Pretty Good Privacy
secure message system) is freely downloadable from public networks around
the world."
"Reconsideration is in order.  The administration should halt the intro-
duction of its key escrow system and reconsider this half-baked scheme, which was hatched during the previous administration.  And Congress should mandate a serious, open, public review of cryptography policy and its
implication for society."
Pretty clear statement of opinion from a body of IEEE, eh?

As to why you might want to check against a list, consider it private and
a priviledge to participate in.  Another example, 'punksters decide to work

Bottom line, don't you want to know that the person you think you are respondingto today is the same person you were communicating last week etc?  Don't you
want to keep someone from pretending to be you and sending out opinions etc.

@_subject: Another Censorship, Freedom of Speech, Rights of Vendor Issue 
To supporters of freedom of speech - please read, act and
share this as your conscience dictates:
Unofficially excerpted from Infoworld 3/7/94 Brian Livingston's
Window Manager column.
"Can CompuServe succeed in silencing Windows dissenters?  Having
your electronic mail account cut off is the modern equivalent
of solitary confinement.  Many services I use, such as Microsoft
Windows forums, exist exclusively on systems such as the CompuServe
Information Service.  There is no other place for information.
"That's why I took notice when CompuServe threatened to cut off a subscriber's account if he even mentioned on-line a lawsuit that
the company filed against him.
"Compuserve filed suit January 31 in Federal District Court in Ohio
against Richard S. Patterson, the developer of a shareware program
called Windows Navigator (WinNAV), which he has distributed on
Compuserve for several years.
This suit came about after Patterson complained on a Compuserve forum last December that the company's plans to release a product
called Windows Navigator infringed upon his trademarks.
"Prior to initiating the suit, Compuserve modified the name of its
product to CompuServe Navigator, Windows Version.  It asks the court
to find that Patterson has "no trademark rights" that it has infringed, and for an unspecified monetary penalty.
"I don't know who will prevail in this suit.  But what really
bothers me is this threat in a letter to Patterson dated January 31,
from Kevin J. Osterkamp, Compuserve's attorney in the firm of Roetzel and Andress, of Columbus, Ohio;
"I am as legal counsel for Compuserve compelled to advise you that
it is Compuserves position that you will be terminated if you
mention, discuss, or comment upon the lawsuit or the issues
related thereto as a part of the CompuServe Information Service.
Termination will also result from any other disparagment of
Compuserve, its management, employees, or business practices.
"I've never met Mr. Patterson, but I know him tangentially from
his other software, Zip Tools, which appears in Windows Gizmos.
"My columns have promoted CompuServe many times, so I asked for it's position.  The gist of the reply I received from Mr. Oster-
kamp was this:
"Regarding the case of Compuserve vs. Patterson, my ethical obligations (and Mr. Patterson's) prohibit me from commenting
directly on the case.  I can, however, assure you that our request that Mr. Patterson stop using Compuserve's online
services to disparage the company is simply good, old-fashioned
common sense.  After all, why should CompuServe - or any online
service - allow a disgruntled party the opportunity to bad-
mouth the company in its own forum?
"Why, indeed?  It's called "a free exchange of ideas."  It is
much sought after by people around the world.
"If AT&T could cut off my phone because I criticized them while
using long distance, we would be in very serious danger of losing
our freedom.
"It is unclear whether electronic services are "common carriers"
(like AT&T) that must carry all communications, or "publishers"
(like magazines) that are legally responsible for the words they
choose to print.
"But Compuserve knows which it prefers to be.  In separate cases,
it has been sued by the National Music Publishers Association and
Cubby Inc. for distributing material uploaded by subscribers.
Compuserve argues that it should be free from any liability
because "it is a distributor and not a publisher."
"Our future "information highway" will inevitably center on just five or six giant corporations.  That's why it's so important
that access not be denied to someone whom these entities don't
"Because children read forums, I agree that obscene language should be banned.  But I've read the forum messages, and
Patterson is not guilty of that.
"Do me a favor.  Sit down right now and tap out a message to
Mauryve Cox, the CEO of Compuserve.  His I.D. number is
70003,1550.  Tell him how important it is to you that no one
be denied access to Compuserve forums.  Send me a copy,
if my account still works after this column appears.

@_subject: Suggestions for InfoHighway Patrol dealing with abusive (cr)users 
Alright, CP's, I've got a humorous one for you.  The author is Gordon
McLachlan (mclachlan and the article appeared in the
"Crosswired" column of May 1994 Vol. 5 No. 5 Lan Computing.  Hope it gives
you a chuckle.  (Unofficially included below) "Cane the Internet Loons"
According to University of Michigan President James Duderstadt, it was a
"monstrous act." An act that "made a mockery of the values of civility we
hold dear." Was it a brutal campus murder?  A rape?  An assault?  Did they
lose a football game to Ohio State?  Nope.  It was email with the intent
to inflict great psychological injury.  In early April, someone apparently ripped off a Michigan student's password
and made offencive racial and ethnic slurs to several Internet Usenet
newsgroups.  According to a written statement by university officials, this
event "offended, hurt and frightened" many faculty, staff and students.  Unfortunately the Internet has no official rules, and no way to effectively
punish computerized criminals such as the person who sent these hurtful
messages.  Underlying Internet etiquette is the realization that the net
hovers somewhere between anarchy and democracy.  In effect this means you
can say anything you want, but if you say the wrong thing, society's only
recourse is to assemble an unruly mob at your electronic doorway to burn
you out.  If your transgression of netiquette is severe enough, you will be pilloried
in public by your fellows and sent a barrage of hate mail.  If you persist
in being a pain in the ass, the system administrator at your home site
will be flooded with mail telling him to cut you off.  In the Michigan incident, this response was insufficient.  All the
well-meaning hate mail from the defenders of the net was sent to the wrong
guy - the poor physics major who had his password stolen.  Despite rapid
action by the administration to deplore the act, write an apologetic
missive to post on the net, and have "various units {sponsor} community
forums where we can share our concerns," there isn't much anyone can do.  Well, to hell with sharing our concerns.  A monstrous act deserves a
monstrous response.  In Singapore, they'd hunt the perpetrator down and
cane him.  And if caning is good enough for a kid from Ohio who vandalizes
cars, its good enough for a kid from Michigan who offends sensitive network
types.  Luckily our opportunity is at hand.  At this very moment, congress is
getting tough on crime, ready to fine, imprison and kill more young men for
a variety of heinous offenses against society.  I hope this shocking
incident is enough to wake up our legislatures before there are more
drive-by shootings on the information super-highway.  First of all, we need a seven-day waiting period and a thorough background
check before anyone can get issued a user-ID.  This would give system
administrators time to find out if a user is a loon, or has been bounced
off of other systems for misbehaving.  To support this effort, congress
should establish a national database to keep track of network offenders.  A quick scan of almost any mailing list or newsgroup will reveal sociopaths
who should have their access priviledges revoked.  And we should never
forget that network access is a priviledge and not a right.  Its ironic to
me that we license people to drive cars, but all you need to get on the
information superhighway is a MODEM.  Of course, a waiting period won't stop network terrorists from stealing other
peoples passwords and firing off their Scud missives, but there is much
more we can do.  By making MODEM manufacturers install something like the Clipper encryption
chip in every MODEM they sell, we could trace offensive messages right back
to their source so the Feds could confiscate the offending hardware.  Maybe we could even use our national health plan ID cards to restrict
access to the info highway by requiring every terminal or PC keyboard to
incorporate a magnetic card reader.  Furthermore, we should require speed licensing for the use of email
distribution lists.  Just as we have the right to bear arms but not fully
automatic weapons, there are damn few good reasons why you need to have a
mailing list.  If its too much trouble to type out the names of all the
people you are sending mail to, youre probably sending it to too many
people.  Curtailing the use of mailing lists would drastically limit the impact that
any maladjusted weenie could have on our delicate sensibilities.  That makes
it worth any minor inconvenience it might cause.  In the event that these steps are insufficient, we should impose stiffer
penalties on network criminals.  Theft of a password should be made a
federal felony with manditory hard time.  With "three strikes and youre
out" a third breech of netiquette should result in revocation of all
network priviledges and removal of your cable TV hookup.  Some bleeding hearts may argue that these measures will stifle the free
exchange of ideas, but if thats what it takes to stop people from being
offended, hurt and frightened, its a small price to pay.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
                    VIACRYPT POLICY STATEMENT
     ViaCrypt(tm) PGP(tm) compatibility with MIT PGP Version 2.6
                         27 May 1994
     This policy statement may be reproduced and redistributed
as long as it is done so in its entirety and without alteration.
     On 24 May 1994, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology
began distribution of PGP Version 2.6 which incorporates the
RSAREFTM Cryptographic Toolkit and is licensed for personal
noncommercial use along with other restrictions.  MIT stated that
to protect RSADSI's intellectual property rights in public key
technology, PGP V2.6 is designed so that messages it creates
after 1 September 1994 will be unreadable by earlier versions of
PGP, which includes ViaCrypt PGP V2.4.  PGP V2.6 will, however,
always be able to read messages generated by ViaCrypt PGP V2.4.
     It is ViaCrypt's policy to make ViaCrypt PGP interoperable
with both ViaCrypt PGP V2.4 as well as with MIT's release of PGP
V2.6.  Therefore ViaCrypt will soon release ViaCrypt PGP V2.7
which will contain new features found in PGP V2.6 and will accept
messages created by ViaCrypt PGP V2.4 as well as those created by
PGP V2.6.
     For messages created by ViaCrypt PGP V2.7, either the
present format compatible with ViaCrypt 2.4 or the new format
which will be produced by PGP V2.6 after 1 September 1994, can be
selected.  Because PGP V2.6 is licensed for personal
noncommercial use, after 1 September 1994 the new format is
expected to come into wide use.  ViaCrypt strongly urges all
ViaCrypt PGP users to upgrade to ViaCrypt PGP V2.7 and to the new
format.      A ViaCrypt PGP V2.7 upgrade package will be made available
to registered users of ViaCrypt PGP V2.4 at a nominal charge of
$10 (which includes shipping and handling).  Effective the date
of this notice and until ViaCrypt PGP V2.7 begins shipping, all
new purchasers of ViaCrypt PGP V2.4 will automatically receive a
free ViaCrypt PGP V2.7 upgrade package.

The above issue's cover page is on "Encryption - Key to a Secure Future"
It has several articles re encryption, and included the Wiley Books
section (which also had Applied Cryptography on the cover page of its
pull-out section) from which I quoted as a source for the book.
On the Editor's Notepad (Page 4) there are two paragraphs of note.
"If the cyberpunk {sic their spelling} crowd ever created a medal for mad
courage in the face of insuperable odds, that medal should go to John Gilmore, who has just filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request
for _the entire Clipper encryption key database_, now being compiled by
the Feds for use in their demented Clipper system.  Gilmore and his
attorney have studied Clipper and the FOIA in detail and have found no
exemptions that would apply to the key database.  They've scratched
together some donations and are taking the government to court under FOIA for refusing to release the database to them.
"The Feds always win, even if they have to break their own laws to do it.
Nevertheless, Gilmore & Co. may slow the project down some, and we can all
savor the irritation they will doubtless cause the Powers in the process
Also from the same page:
_No Code Overseas_
"Asinine Federal regulations concerning the export of cryptographic tech-
nology means that code diskettes for this issue destined for overseas
subscribers will not contain any of the encryption-related code.  Our
First Amendment prevents the Feds from censoring printed material in the
magazine, but software on diskette is not protected that way.  There's
nothing we can do.  Vote _against_ your representatives this fall, regardless of party; that's the only thing that gets their attention.
On Page 6 Jeff Duntemann KG7JF has another full page re Clipper and gives
full and "express permission to freely print and distribute this editorial
electron- ically in the cause of defeating the Clipper initiative."
On page 12 they list the source as available on Compu$erve GO CLMFORUM
and see Lib 16.  Also Turbo User Group Library sells the PC Techniques
archive listing disks at 206-779-9508.
Who knows, they might slip up and have the code available there...
On page 24, Bruce Schneier has an article "Secret Sharing" - perhaps
if you ask you can get his OK to include it here.
Page 35 has an article on "Simple Encryption via XOR" by Mark R. Parker.
For those of you feeling the werewolf need to rip something apart in
an electronic feeding frenzy, this should keep you sated for a millisecond
or two... Also, in the June issue of Upside ("The Business Magazine for the Techno-
logy Elite" - their title), the Editor-In-Chief, Eric Nee, has a commentary entitled "Keep Big Brother Out."  Guess what it is about,
Over the last few months I've been colleting articles on DSP's from the
many trade rags I get.  I'd be happy to send one copy to someone who
is seriously interested in this and willing to scan them in etc. to
share with like-minded CP'sters.  Aloha from Paradise {lost}

A correct and bug-free implementation of IP source routing allows
any host on the internet to masquerade as any IP address that it would
like to, thus breaking any access control based on the source IP address
(eg, most of the unix r-utilities.)
Exactly how to do this is left as an excercise to the reader, but the
fundamental problem is that the source route allows the packet to travel
"through" possibly suspect IP entities that have not had the slightest
amount of authentication as "trustworthy" routers applied to them.

public access to White House e-mail, but later this year the National

of e-mail messages.  The book includes Iran-Contra affair communications to
and from Oliver North, who used e-mail because he thought it could be
easily deleted. One message from him reads: "Oh lord. I lost the slip and
broke one of the high heels. Forgive please. Will return the wig on

Avoid Encryption Anarchy
=======================Tim:  like the title? -NS
BY DONN B. PARKER
Encryption is a powerful tool for protecting
data stored in workstations, LANs and
mainframe systems and in transit between
systems. In fact, it is so powerful that its misuse
may cause great damage to tomorrow's informa-
tion owners and users. Unfortunately, this "en-
cryption anarchy" may come very soon if work-
station and network encrYPtion is allowed to
proliferate unchecked in its present form.
What is encryption anarchy
and how might it happen in
your organization? Here are
some examples:
Hidden by voice encryp-
tion, an employee could leak
valuable information over
phone lines, without worry-
ing about wire taps or call
monitoring/recording. Also,
Privacy-Enhanced Mail is
increasing on the Internet.
But its encryption-based cer-
tificates protect individual
end-users by shielding their
activities from managers. En-
cryption technologies such as
these could reduce or elimi-
nate management control
over voice and data communi-
cations with the outside world.
Large amounts of worksta-
tion, LAN and mainframe in-
formation may be lost if it is
encrypted incorrectly, if de-
cryption fails or if encryption
keys are lost. As a result,
many users may adopt less-
secure practices. These in-
clude backing up copies of
files in cleartext or storing
encryption keys where they
can be compromised. Both
practices can result in more
exposure of information to
unauthorized parties.
Corporate deception also
could become easier. If false
information is given to audi-
tors, for example, the true
data could be hidden behind an
encryption barricade. In one company, an ex-execu-
tive's alleged theft of trade se-
crets only after the company
reviewed his e-mail.
The executive's actions
might never have been known
if he had encrypted his e-mail
and kept the key.
An employee could leave a
company and take copies of
valuable data. If no one else
knows the encryption
keys, the remaining en-
crypted data will be lost.
As international
companies turn to en-
cryption to protect
communications with
trading partners, sup-
pliers, contractors and
customers in different
countries, it will be-
come increasingly diffi-
cult to manage and
control the many dif-
ferent algorithms and
keys that will be used in
the organizations'
workstations, LANs
and mainframe sys-
tems. Countries'differ-
ing import/export
controls, encryption laws and restrictions on
data exchange will cre-
ate both operational and man
agement headaches.
Without centralized, en-
forced encryption standards,
workstations, LANs and wide-
area networks will include
varying products,technolo-
gies and key-management ap-
proaches. Today's transitory
data will be encrypted in dif-
ferent ways, as will critical databack-ups and archives. Years
from now, however, these files
could become unavailable if
encryption algorithms and key
changes are not carefully
tracked and controlled.
A matter of control.
These examples reveal that
encryption anarchy may occur
when the people who control
and use information are not
accountable for it or have no
jurisdiction over it, or when
people who rightfully own in-
formation lose control over it.
Encryption anarchy may also
occur through the indiscrimi-
nate use of encryption without
standardized key manage-
ment or managerial oversight.
But even the proper use of
encryption could, in
the future, create unan-
ticipated technical
problems in network
settings. For example,
LAN maintenance and
diagnosis often requires
that information be
checked for authentici-
ty and integrity. This is
done by comparing in-
formation sent with in-
formation received. If
ny a this is done in real time
on an encrypted net-
work, special testing
systems and additional
network encryption/de-
cryption operations
may be required.
Similarly, LAN
managers may have to
install special back-up
and recovery products
tabdlty as LANs become in-
creasingly encrypted. These
could add unexpected operat-
ing costs, and the additional
key management may intro-
duce new security exposures.
How can infosecurity man-
agers avoid encryption anar-
chy in the coming years? First,
make sure that information
(whether encrypted or not) re-
mains accessible to all man-
agers, boards of directors,
reg llators and auditors who
are held accountable for it or
have jurisdiction over it. No
one person should possess ex-
clusive encrypted access to an
information asset.
Encryption also should be
managed using a hierarchy of
override decryption keys cor-
responding to information
ownership and accountability
in the organization. This over-
ride hierarchy should extend
beyond the organization--
under careful control--to any
government or regulatory
body overseeing the enter-
prise The U.S. government's
Clipper escrowed-key propos-
al, although a step in that di-
rection, does not go far
enough in providing these hi-
erarchical override capabili-
ties. Encryption keys must be
escrowed in business organiza-
tions as well.
Infosecurity managers also
could avoid encryption anar-
chy by enforcing related poli-
cies and standards, choosing
technologies with assured
Iongevity and training users to
handle encryption properly.
When not to encrypt.
In some cases, encryption may
even be inadvisable. Much
business information may be
adequately protected with
commercially available data-
compression utilities, and not
full-fledged encryption. Other
information may be accessed
so often that encryption or
compression is imprac-
tical due to its cost, in-
convenience and
processing time. If in-
formation is ubiquitous,
it makes no sense to
protect it in one place
and not in another.
There also may be
valid business reasons to
not encrypt. A newspa-
per, for example, may
deliberately exchange
cleartext messages with
correspondents in a for-
eign country, to avoid
any impression that
these individuals are
spying or otherwise
working against the
Even if encryption is im-
plemented and managed
properly, infosecurity man-
agers should assume that their
adversaries--industrial spies,
thieves, burglars and even kid-
nappers and murderers--
will try to obtain information
through the easiest possible
route. If they encounter en-
cryption, an easier route may
be through inside informants,
human engineering or dump-
ster diving. In fact, interviews
with more than 200 computer
criminals reveal that the most
vulnerable form of
information is spoken,
followed by printed/
dlsplayed, removable
media, and finally
information that is
communicated elec-
tronically or stored
in computers. In the
coming years, do not
overlook the many
such ways in which

Which crypto to use?
Most encryption products using the Data Encryption Standard (DES) will be acceptable for
at least thc next five years. After that time, DES will be discontinued as a U.S. federal
standard and will no longer have the same strong due-care status it enjoys today. This is
because increasing computing speeds will make the algorithm too weak for some applications.
Many claim that DES and Rivest-
Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithms will remain acceptable indefinitely. New encryption products and technologies, however, probably will encour-
age a migration to new algorithms beyond the next five years.
For example, in spite of recent protests, Clipper/Skipjack, Digital Signature Algorithm
and their hardware implementations will see greater acceptance, but only in the U.S. govern-
ment and among government Contractors. Other methods, such as DES triple encryption,
will provide alternatives in commercial settings.
However, international acceptance of Clipper/Skipjack may take longer, due to various
countries' import export restrictions and U.S. control of the technology's algorithm and es-
crowed keys. The underlying purpose of this control is not just to facilitate court-approved
wire taps, but also to discourage criminals and foreign entities from using Clipper/Skipjack
technology. This control mechanism would force them to use other, less powerful, algorithms
and key management.
Over time, the effectiveness, change frequency and management of encryption keys
probably will prove more important than the specific algorithms chosen. New encryption
products that automate these activities and make them transparent to users may help
strengthen encryption management, even though
fhey may introduce more opportunities for
technical compromise.
Infosecurity managers would be wise to delay the use of any of these new encryption
technologies. This would allow time for products to fully develop and early adopters to report
their experiences.

     COMPUTER POLICY COMMITTEE CALLS FOR WITHDRAWAL OF CLIPPER             COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY "TOO IMPORTANT" FOR                      SECRET DECISION-MAKING
     WASHINGTON, DC The public policy arm of the oldest and largest international computing society today urged the White House to withdraw the controversial "Clipper Chip" encryption proposal.  Noting that the "security and privacy of electronic communications are vital to the development of national and international information infrastructures," the Association for Computing Machinery's U.S. Public Policy Committee (USACM) added its voice to the growing debate over encryption and privacy      In a position statement released at a press conference on Capitol Hill, the USACM said that "communications security is too important to be left to secret processes and classified algorithms."  The Clipper technology was developed by the National Security Agency, which classified the cryptographic algorithm that underlies the encryption device.  The USACM believes that Clipper "will put U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage in the global market and will adversely affect technological development within the United States."   The technology has been championed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the NSA, which claim that "non-escrowed" encryption technology threatens law enforcement and national security.
     "As a body concerned with the development of government technology policy, USACM is troubled by the process that gave rise to the Clipper initiative," said Dr. Barbara Simons, a computer scientist with IBM who chairs the USACM.  "It is vitally important that privacy protections for our communications networks be developed openly and with full public participation."
     The USACM position statement was issued after completion of a comprehensive study of cryptography policy sponsored by the ACM (see companion release).  The study, "Codes, Keys and Conflicts: Issues in U.S Crypto Policy," was prepared by a panel of experts representing various constituencies involved in the debate over      The ACM, founded in 1947, is a 85,000 member non-profit educational and scientific society dedicated to the development and use of information technology, and to addressing the impact of that technology on the world's major social challenges.

   =============================================================
       USACM Position on the Escrowed Encryption Standard
The ACM study "Codes, Keys and Conflicts: Issues in U.S Crypto Policy" sets forth the complex technical and social issues underlying the current debate over widespread use of encryption.  The importance of encryption, and the need for appropriate policies, will increase as networked communication grows.  Security and privacy of electronic communications are vital to  the development of national and international information The Clipper Chip, or "Escrowed Encryption Standard" (EES) Initiative, raises fundamental policy issues that must be fully addressed and publicly debated.  After reviewing the ACM study, which provides a balanced discussion of the issues, the U.S. Public Policy Committee of ACM (USACM) makes the following   1.  The USACM supports the development of public policies and technical standards for communications security in open forums in which all stakeholders -- government, industry, and the public -- participate.  Because we are moving rapidly to open networks, a prerequisite for the success of those networks must be standards for which there is widespread consensus, including international acceptance.  The USACM believes that communications security is too important to be left to secret processes and classified algorithms.  We support the principles underlying the Computer Security Act of 1987, in which Congress expressed its preference for the development of open and unclassified security standards.
  2.  The USACM recommends that any encryption standard adopted by the U.S. government not place U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage in the global market or adversely affect technological development within the United States.  Few other nations are likely to adopt a standard that includes a classified algorithm and keys escrowed with the U.S. government.
  3.  The USACM supports changes in the process of developing Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) employed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  This process is currently predicated on the use of such standards solely to support Federal procurement.  Increasingly, the standards set through the FIPS process directly affect non-federal organizations and the public at large.  In the case of the EES, the vast majority of comments solicited by NIST opposed the standard, but were openly ignored.  The USACM recommends that the standards process be placed under the Administrative Procedures Act so that citizens may have the same opportunity to challenge government actions in the area of information processing standards as they do in other important aspects of Federal agency policy making.
  4.  The USACM urges the Administration at this point to withdraw the Clipper Chip proposal and to begin an open and public review of encryption policy.  The escrowed encryption initiative raises vital issues of privacy, law enforcement, competitiveness and scientific innovation that must be openly discussed.
  5.  The USACM reaffirms its support for privacy protection and urges the administration to encourage the development of technologies and institutional practices that will provide real privacy for future users of the National Information

    COMPUTING SOCIETY RELEASES REPORT ON ENCRYPTION POLICY
      "CLIPPER CHIP" CONTROVERSY EXPLORED BY EXPERT PANEL
     WASHINGTON, DC  A panel of experts convened by the nation's foremost computing society today released a comprehensive report on U.S. cryptography policy.  The report, "Codes, Keys and Conflicts: Issues in U.S Crypto Policy," is the culmination of a ten-month review conducted by the panel of representatives of the computer industry and academia, government officials, and attorneys.  The 50-page document explores the complex technical and social issues underlying the current debate over the Clipper Chip and the export control of information security technology.
     "With the development of the information superhighway, cryptography has become a hotly debated policy issue," according to Joseph DeBlasi, Executive Director of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), which convened the expert panel.  "The ACM believes that this report is a significant contribution to the ongoing debate on the Clipper Chip and encryption policy.  It cuts through the rhetoric and lays out the facts."
     Dr. Stephen Kent, Chief Scientist for Security Technology with the firm of Bolt  Beranek and Newman, said that he was pleased with the final report.  "It provides a very balanced discussion of many of the issues that surround the debate on crypto policy, and we hope that it will serve as a foundation for further public debate on this topic."       The ACM report addresses the competing interests of the various stakeholders  in  the  encryption debate  --  law enforcement agencies,  the intelligence community, industry and users of communications services.

         "Clipper Debate Rages Onnnn..." by Charlotte Adams
         Controversy continues to escalate over the government's
         Clipper escrowed-key proposal.  Attacks include an analysis          of just how much taxpayers would have to pay for it, and a          Freedom-of-Information-Act request to hand over Clipper's          escrowed keys.  Meanwhile, the federal government continues          to backpedal, saying that Clipper will not be mandatory,          even for government users.
         What cost Clipper?  To gauge Clipper's economic impact on
         taxpayers, Steve Walker, president of Trusted Information          Systems Inc., offers the following analysis.                  Approximately 5,000 legally authorized wiretaps take          place each year, based on a reported total of 800.           He increased this reported figure to 1,000, for argument's          sake, and multiplied by five to account for multiphone          wiretaps.) There are approximately 500 million phones in          the U.S., so the ratio of taps to the total number of phones is
         about O.001 percent.
         If the government taps 0.001 percent of AT&T's estimated market
         of 250,000 Clipper-equipped telephones, that works out to 2.5          key-escrow taps per year. Since the cost to run the country's          two planned key-escrow centers is estimated at about $6 million          per year, Clipper taps could cost taxpayers $2.4 million apiece          (beyond the $250 million to buy the Clipper-equipped phones at          $1,000 apiece in the first place).  But if the number of Clip
         per phones sold is 100-fold greater than AT&T estimates--25          million devices--there would still be only 250 escrow
         taps per year and one call to key-escrow centers every 1.5 days,
         Walker figures. Each approved Clipper tap, under these cir-
         cumstances, would cost $24,000.
         Now, add to these escrowed-tap approval costs the estimated          $50,000 to $60,000 that would be required to actually set up
         each wiretap.
         More than 1,000 Clipper crypto devices have been sold
         commercially since the products became available late last year,
         Department of Justice officials said. So far, the government has
         purchased another 9,000.
         Stalling tactics.  A response to the Freedom-of-Information-
         Act (FOIA) request for Clipper's keys filed by Electronic Frontier
         Foundation cofounder, John Gilmore, is slow in coming. According to          Gilmore's lawyer, Lee Tien, the FOIA applications--to the          Department of the Treasury and Department of Commerce
         --have only generated requests for more time. The agencies,
         however, "seem to be making an effort to respond," Tien adds.
         Now, it's voluntary.  Government witnesses testifying before
         back-to-back congressional hearings in May stressed the voluntary          nature of key-escrow technology for both government and
         commercial use. But others demanded more than executive-branch          reassurances.
         Raymond Kammer, deputy director of the National Institute
         of Standards and Technology, told a House Science, Space and
         Technology panel that he hopes government use will drive prices
         down far enough to make Clipper phones attractive to the public.          Citizens may also wish to buy Clipper-equipped phones for          communicating with government agencies, he added.
         Among Clipper critics, David Farber, professor of
         telecommunication systems at the University of Pennsylvania,
         told the House subcommittee that Congress needs to "weld
         into law" guarantees that Clipper will not be mandatory. And
         Trusted Information Systems' Walker told an earlier hearing
         before the SenateJudiciary Subcommittee on Technology and
         the Law that the administration should not "proceed on its own
         without separation of powers." He suggested putting key-es-
         crow centers under the judiciary branch, so that the executive
         branch "can't twist arms."

         NSA Launches ATM Encryption.           Trying to stay in step with rapidly evolving telecommuncations
         technology, the National Security Agency has kicked off an
         Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) encryption program to provide
         end-to-end encoding across synchronous optical network (SONET)
         systems.  Called Fastlane, the ATM project specifies optical-
         channel  (OC) rates, with OC12 desired.  The work will parallel
         a SONET encryptor development program awarded to Motorola earlier
         this year.

@_subject: Anti-Clipper Article in "THe Computer Applications Journal" 
FYI the following is scanned, not stirred (or forwarded) from "The Computer
Applications Journal", July 1994, issue  (a 'zine with a refreshingly
technical mix of software, hardware info for board-level integration with
current popular operating systems e.g. DOS etc.)
         By John Iovine
         Cryptology is a science of enciphering and deciphering messages
         and information. The word conjures up images of espionage, spies,          hostile government action, and top secret information. We don't          usually associate this word with privacy--your privacy--but it          is this facet of cryptology that is being argued today in our          courts and among government agencies.
         ENCRYPTED PRIVACY?
         The arena where electronic bits of information are transmitted
         through data conduits is loosely termed "cyberspace." Currently, in
         cyberspace there's no guarantee of privacy. Transmitted messages
         may be intercepted and read indiscriminately. This possible invasion of
         privacy is not just limited to Email on your local BBS or on
         Internet. Our national telephone network, which handles voice and          fax as well as computer telecommunication, is vulnerable.
         Additional data conduits like cable television systems and satellite
         feeds are becoming more commonplace all across the country. These
         newer networks are vulnerable to interception as well.
         To better grasp the threat, imagine a company that
         routinely transmits bids or promotional information to
         field agents through one of these networks. The company can be put
         at a severe disadvantage if a competitor gains access to
         this information.
         The dark side of our information age is that technically skilled
         crooks--sometimes romantically referred to as phreakers and crackers          can create havoc in your life.           For a while, crackers were making national news by breaking into
         secured government databases.
         Intercepting various unprotected data communications makes most
         people easy targets for others to gain access to confidential
         material.
         Anyone who has been electronically mugged has very little
         sympathy for these criminals. By stealing credit card numbers,
         they are capable of making purchases, charging telephone calls to          your phone number, reading your Email, and listening to cellular          phone conversations.
         The problem is growing. Our national data network increases in size
         and complexity daily. It is changing and defining the methods by
         which people communicate, information is transferred, and business is
         conducted.
         It is therefore becoming increasingly important to secure the
         privacy of the networks and reduce their vulnerability to          interception. Business has been less than responsive to this threat.          For instance, credit card companies justify their exorbitant +19%          interest rates because they are needed to compensate for the
         tremendous amount of credit card (read "electronic") fraud and
         thievery. These companies should be doing
         much more to prevent electronic fraud instead of just passing the
         cost on to honest consumers in the way of high interest rates.
         Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass), the chairman of the House Telecom-
         munication and Finance Subcommittee, had this to say about privacy:
         "Whether it's a cellular phone conversation, computer data, a fax          transmission, a satellite feed, cable programming, or other
         electronic         services, encryption is the key to protecting privacy and security."          He stated further that "developing a national policy
         for encryption and its uses is therefore a process of fundamental
         importance for the future of our national networks and our          competitive position internationally."
--------- ENTER THE CYPHERPUNKS
         That's cypher, not cyber. Let's not confuse these similar sounding
         monikers. The cypherpunks want to see widespread public use          of cryptotechnology. They see the individual's privacy protected          through cryptography. However, they face powerful governmental and          political obstacles.
         The end of the cold war hasn't eliminated the need for cryptography
         and secret codes used by our government. But it should
         have alleviated some of the regulations concerning private use of
         cryptotechnology. The government still classifies cryptotechnology          with hard military weapons such as tanks. The U.S. government agency          in charge of cryptotechnology is the National Security Agency (NSA).          The cypherpunks see the NSA as trying to keep its monopoly on
         cryptotechnology intact.
         One of the most outspoken and visible members of the cypherpunks is
         Iohn Gillmore. Mr. Gillmore has this to say on the subject:
         Government investment leads to government control.
         Government control is detrimental to the development of the media.
         Government seized the control of radio and television in their
         infancy. Since then the media has never had full first amendment
         rights or protection.
         Encryption technology is the key for people and companies to maintain
         their privacy over the networks.  The government should cease its
         involvement .
         John has fought legal battles with the NSA on a few fronts. So
         far he has been victorious.
         BATTLE LINES
         The lines are drawn. On one side you have the cypherpunks who feel
         that good public cryptographic technology safeguards our privacy. The
         NSA feels this is compromising our national security.
         The government has threatened private cryptographers with jail. John
         Gillmore was threatened by the NSA stating that he was on the
         verge of violating the Espionage Act. A conviction would have sent          him to jail  for 10 years.
         How can the government threaten private citizens7 Easily: as stated
         previously, the government classifies cryptographic tools with
         military tanks and bomber planes.
         THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION
         The Administration wants America to encrypt its information to
         protect it from unauthorized access.  The encryption scheme, con-
         tained in the government-sponsored Clipper chip, includes voice as          well as data information sent over communication lines. A major
         catch  in this plan is that only the government-approved encryption is          allowed in any device used by the government or in government
         projects.          Other encryption methods continue to be legal for domestic use, but          only in nongovernment applications.
         The second catch is the potential for a trap door in the
         encryption chip's program that would allow law enforcement agencies          to decipher any encrypted data. Therefol-e, this method of encryption          doesn't alleviate concerns that the government could abuse its ability          to tap into the privacy of the citizenship.
         Of course, organized crime would use its own crytotechnology, anyway.
         So a trap door would only be effective for spying on
         small incidental crooks and private citizens.
         The encryption algorithm touted by the Administration is
         contained in an integrated circuit. This chip, designed by Mykotronx          in Torrance, Calif. and manufactured by VLSI in San Jose, Calif., is          nicknamed "Clipper." It is a 12-Mbps encryption coprocessor. The OEM          cost of the chip is $26 when purchased in large quantities, which
         trickles down to an increase of $100 in the street price of any          electronic equipment (computer, phone, fax that contains the chip.
         SOFTWARE VS. HARDWARE
         There are less expensive encryption chips on the market than the
         Clipper.          Usually anyone interested in encryption takes a software          approach.  It may be a little slower than hardware, but the
         recurring cost is much less. Speed only becomes a critical          consideration when it's necessary to secure fast communication
         such as video or voice communication.
         RECENT EVENTS
         On February 4, 1994, the U.S. Government officially endorsed the
         Clipper chip and directed the Commerce Department's National
         Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Treasury          Department to hold in escrow the keys used to unlock the Clipper
         codes. It also establishes new procedures for exporting products          using Clipper to most countries.
         The government has formed an interagency group whose job it is to
         develop encryption technologies that could serve as alternatives to          Clipper.
         The Clipper endorsement contains three flaws according to a
         policy paper released in January 1994 by the Institute of Electrical          and Electronic Engineers: a classified algorithm, the key-escrow          system, and an encryption standard developed for public use without          public scrutiny.
         The Clipper chip has developed many industrial and congressional
         opponents.  So far, Novell, AT&T, Citicorp, Computer Associates,
         Hughes Aircraft, Motorola, and other major corporations openly          oppose the Clipper encryption standard. The failure of recent          administrations lies in
         the fact that they did not seek greater industry participation
         before proposing the Clipper chip. Further, they ignored protests          from industry and Congress.
         THE BIG BROTHER ISSUE
         The Clipper chip can provide government agencies with
         unprecedented wiretapping ability.
         Ideally, the Clipper chip encrypts (scrambles) communication to
         everyone except the intended recipient. The key code to unscramble
         communication is held by two separate government agencies. The          government has the option of using a joining key code to unscramble
         communications with court-approved legal authorization.
         However, there is a strong possibility that a trap door exists in the
         Clipper chip that would allow agencies unauthorized tapping. The
         government wouldn't allow the algorithm used in the Clipper, called
         "SkipJack," to be studied publicly, so no one knows for sure.
         When the Administration endorsed the Clipper as a Federal Data
         Processing Standard on February 4, it was backed up with an immediate
         order for 50,000 Clipper chips. Meanwhile, a forced export
         embargo keeps all other encryption schemes expensive. U.S.manu-
         facturers must "dumb down" their data encryption programs by
         keeping the key lengths to 40 bits or fewer for legal export. The
         Clipper uses an 80-bit code.
         ENCRYPTION BASICS
         The following is a list of some of the basic terms that are used in
         encryption. Plaintext is the original unaltered message or file.          Ciphertext is the encrypted message or file. An encryption
         algorithm is the function that maps plaintext into ciphertext.           Keys are used to determine mapping.  Keyspace describes the size
         of the key; it determines          the number of all possible keys. For instance, an 8-bit key has a
         keyspace of 256 (256 possible values), where a 16-bit key has a          keyspace of 65,536.  Keys are usually alphanumeric.
         There are three main types of ciphers: substitution, transposition,
         and product. Substitution ciphers substitute each character in the          plaintext with another, determined by the key. Transposition ciphers
         rearrange the characters in plaintext, again, determined by the key.          Product ciphers combine the substitution and transposition
         algorithms.
         A substitution cipher simply substitutes each plaintext character
         with another character determined by the key. For instance, we could          easily displace the alphabet by one character to generate a simple          substitution. For example, ABC...XYZ could become BCD...YZA, and the          phrase "HELLO WORLD" would become "IFMMP XPSME."
         Substitution ciphers are also called Caesar ciphers, because Julius          Caesar used this simple method of encoding messages.
         The transposition cipher system rearranges the characters in
         plaintext. A simple system rearranges every two characters, so "ab"          becomes "ba." With this kind of cipher, "HELLO WORLD" becomes          "EHLLW ORODL."
         GENERATING MORE COMPLEX CIPHER SYSTEMS
         Blaise de Vigenere, a French cryptographer in the sixteenth century,
         complicated the simple Caesar code. He proposed that the key be
         used to change the plaintext in a periodic manner. When a message is          encoded by this method, you change a plaintext letter for each          successive letter in the key, always running through the same          sequence of key letters. A simple example should clear any confusion.
         Suppose the name "John" was selected for the key code. This corre-
         sponds to the number sequence 9, 14, 7, 13. To encode a message
         using this key sequence, divide the letters of the plaintext message
         into groups of four.  This corresponds to the four letters used in the
         key.          To each letter group, add 9 to the number value of the
         first letter of each group, 14 to the second letter, 7 to the third          letter, and 13 to the fourth letter. The example below illustrates          the Vigenere code:
         Key Code: JohnJohnJohnJohn
         Plaintext message: helloworld
         Ciphertext message: qssy xlvf m
         As you can see, the coding algorithms are becoming more
         complex. Even this code pales to the more sophisticated programs          available.
         THE DEBATE CONTINUES
         I've only scratched the surface in the great encryption debate.          There are a number of on-line newsletters carried on the Circuit          Cellar BBS that follow the issue closely Computer Underground Digest          [CuD] and Electronic Frontier Foundation [EFF].

A little birdy sent this my way, and I thought you might find it of
interest.  And this article is "scanned, not shaken or stirred." ;-)
                    COMPUTERWORLD  AUGUST 1, 1994
Agents spy Internet data
By Mitch Betts
Langley, VA
After decades of viewing public information as practically useless, U.S.
intelligence agencies are planning to exploit the wild and ultrapublic
Internet in search of cheap but useful nuggets of  information.
By summer's end, the Central Intelligence Agency and five other
intelligence units will hook up to the Internet to collect and share
"opensource," or unclassified, information, CIA official Joseph Markowitz
"The six-node Internet link will give intelligence analysts an access
point to the Internet at large, including access to electronic mail by
subject-matter experts across the globe,"Markowitz said in a recent
interview. He is director of the CIA's Community Open Source Program
Office, which opened March 1.
"The Internet will be a gateway to commercial on-line information
services, he added, as well as a vehicle for sharing open-source
intelligence with sister agencies such as the National Security Agency and
the Defense Intelligence Agency."
Naturally, the spy agencies are keenly aware of the danger of security
breaches from Internet hackers. Markowitz said they are installing a
commercial-grade "firewall"--essentially a server with access-control
software--to protect internal computer networks from Internet intrusions.
In addition, a special, undisclosed hardware device will allow analysts to
transfer Internet files to their high-security workstations while
preventing file transfers in the opposite direction, Markowitz said.
These days the Internet is getting crowded with investigators of all
sorts. Many private-sector researchers already use the Internet to
supplement their heavy-duty use of online vendors such as Dialog
Information Services, lnc. For example, John F. Quinn, a business
intelligence professional in Vienna, Va., and former CIA analyst in Japan,
recently used the Internet's Gopher navigation tool to collect information
on foreign reaction to the death of North Korea's leader. James Cook, a
California-based business investigator, runs an Internet-based discussion
group called InfoPro, where information professionals swap advice and
establish far-flung contacts.
But using the Internet for intelligence has a downside. For example,
queries posted on public news groups or mailing lists may alert the world
to the research topic unless the query is artfully phrased. "There is a
danger of tipping your hand," Quinn said. "I use the lnternet to contact a
colleague [directly], but I am loathe to post something publicly." Another
problem is information overload and the urgent need to filter incoming
Internet messages. "The information will be affordable and accessible, but
electronic filtering hasn't progressed as far as we'd like," Markowitz said.
Furthermore, private-sector researchers warned there are no
quality-control police on the Internet. The danger of getting outdated or
bad information is quite real. On-line researcher Helen Burwell in Houston
put it this way: "The Internet is a great big closet full of junk and
treasures, so you have to go in there judiciously."
"You may get to know 100 to 500 new contacts, including ones in Italy and
Russia, but the next question is how competent and reliable are they?"
said Cook, a due diligence consultant for business investors. "You need to
build a circle of trusted people."
Markowitz agreed that it takes a lot of mining to get a few nuggets from
the Internet. "With open sources, there's lots more information available,
but it has a poor signal-to-noise ratio," he said. A big challenge is
getting the clandestine service to accept open-source intelligence as
being valuable, Quinn said, because the spy culture figures that "if it's
not secret, it' s not worthwhile . " One reason for the new interest in
on-line resources is they are low-risk and cheap when compared with
billion-dollar spy satellites at a time of shrinking budgets. Further, the
spy agencies are being asked to provide unclassified reports about more
diverse topics, Markowitz said.
"The reality is that open sources are now superior in many cases to
existing classified sources, such as in dealing with African crises, where
the intelligence community has mediocre to nonexistent capabilities," said
Robert D. Steele, president of Oakton, Va.-based Open Source Solutions,
Inc., a non-profit organization that promotes the broader use of
open-source intelligence. "The creation of our office is a recognition
that open sources are a valuable resource. As we draw back in some parts
of the world, our office provides an information safety net," Markowitz said.

This is like those recordings while you are on hold that say "your call
may be monitored for quality assurance" etc. - they have to warn you up
front to do so legally.  You then have a choice to use or not use their
system for any communications you want kept private from their perusing
Big difference here - in Hawaii you must put up signs if you have any
video monitoring equipment in or around the common areas, perimeter of the
building etc. informing people that the areas are monitored using video
surveillance etc.  Inside your apartment is another story - over here you
are protected by the Landlord-Tenant code not to mention a variety of
other ordinance.
Surprise.  It is their equipment to do with as they please and if you
don't want to follow along with their conditions of access...  In the
gov't it is literally against the law and considered theft of government
resources (cpu time, equipment (pc, terminal etc.), electricity...) to use
government equipment for private purposes.
This is where PGP on your local machine fits in.  As long as they don't
have your private key and can't capture keystrokes or access your local
machine you can keep your communications private.
Try EPIC, CPSR, EFF for info.

Within the US Gov't it is not uncommon to be told that you are not to

working on _their_ time.  Seems kinda harsh, but is legal and within their

@_subject: CIAC Notice - Virus with Crypto Tech... 
Excerpted from CIAC, a report of a stealth virus that uses encryption as
part of its attack.
If the list thinks its of interest, I'll zap it over.
But briefly:
September 13, 1994 1600 PDT                                       Number E-34
PROBLEM:        A previously unknown computer virus is damaging systems.
PLATFORM:       All MS-DOS, PC-DOS, Windows systems, all versions.
DAMAGE:         Damages files, encrypts hard drive.
SOLUTION:       Update your Anti-Virus program to detect/remove the virus.
VULNERABILITY   While it is not epidemic, the virus has been seen at an East
ASSESSMENT:     coast site and it isn't detected by the current versions of
                most virus scanners (revised versions are upcoming.) The
                virus is intentionally damaging and all files on an infected
                machine are at risk.
                Warning: Removing the virus may make some files inaccessible
                (see below.)
The virus is intentionally damaging. Every time an infected machine boots,
the virus encrypts two cylinders of the DOS partition of the hard drive
starting with the highest numbered cylinder and progressing to lower numbered
ones. The virus then hides the fact that it is encrypting the hard drive by
decrypting any of the encrypted sectors whenever they are accessed by the
system. Only with the virus out of memory do you see the encrypted sectors.
WARNING: Because of the encryption the virus does, be sure you copy any
important files to a floppy disk or tape before removing the virus. The
CHK_HALF program described below does not decrypt any encrypted cylinders, so
when the virus is removed, the encryption key is lost with it and any files
in the encrypted cylinders are lost.

          Floating Point Divide Flaw in Intel Pentium Processor Chip
         ============================================================
               __    __      __      ___   ___  ____     ____                /_/\  /_/|    /_/     / _/\ /_/| / __/ \  / __/\  |\ \| ||   /  \ \   | /\/ | || | /\ \/  | | \/  ||\ \ ||  / /\ \ \   \ \  | || |_\/ /\  | |     || \ \|| / /--\ \ \ /\_\\ | || | |\ \ \ | \_/\ _|/  \_|//_/    \_\/ \/__/ |_|/ |_| \_\/ \___\/              NASA Automated Systems Incident Response Capability
         ============================================================
  NASIRC  has  become  aware of  a floating-point  division problem in  some
  versions  of the Pentium  processor chip,  manufactured by Intel. Although
  this is not a security  issue,  NASIRC  is bringing this to your attention
  because  the  defect could cause erroneous results for NASA projects which
  rely  on  complex   mathematical computations  involving  double-precision
  arithmetic.
  Information on this problem  is  currently  being  propagated  through the
  Internet and both technical and general publications.  We are issuing this
  bulletin to provide a synopsis of what is known about the problem,  how to   check for the flaw, and what to do about it.   It is important  that  any  individual  who  uses  a  computer utilizing a
  Pentium  processor  perform  the  test(s)  described  in  this bulletin on
  his/her  machine  to  check for the bug.  Although there have been reports
  the  Pentium/60  is not  affected,  NASIRC  recommends these units also be
  tested.   There  is no part number or other marking which would designate the flawed   processor chips from the later revisions, which do not contain the bug.
  Intel  considers  this  flaw  to  be minor,  and has  stated: "the average
  spreadsheet  user  should  only  be affected by this bug once every 27,000
  years".  However,  NASIRC feels there is a high probability that work done
  on  this  class  of   desktop  system  in  NASA   is  most  likely  to  be
  computationally intensive,  and  the  likelihood  of  achieving  erroneous
  results is strong. From a reliability and reputation standpoint, NASA must
  ensure  that the tools it uses to accomplish its mission perform properly.
  The  president  of  Intel  has  issued a communique, stating his company's
  position  on  the  problem,   and  the the process to follow should a site   discover  a  flawed system.  The  communique  is  available via WWW at the
  URL:     Pentium machines can be tested by using any of the following three   methods: 1) Using the Microsoft Windows calculator, perform the following
   computation:      x = 4195835
     y = 3145727
     z = x - (x/y)*y
   If z = 256, your chip has the bug.  The Windows calculator is the
   easiest way to run this test. If you program this calculation, be
   sure to use to use double-precision variables!
2) Using any spreadsheet application (Lotus 1-2-3, Excel, etc), perform
   the following test:
     Enter the following data:
     In cell A1:    4195835
     In cell A2:    3145727
     In cell A3:    3145727
     Calculate the following value:
               (A1 * A2)/A3

But if you are not including an enhanced attachment i.e. binary file, why
not just send it as a standard mail message?  MIME messages are difficult
at best to forward, for example.

Without cryptography how exactly are you going to protect my credit card
numbers from sniffer-snoopers and crackers?  Either you will send the
credit card text in the clear, or it will be encrypted somehow.  Or perhaps
you will have customers call you over the phone to give you their credit
card info?  - -NetSurfer

I got your point from your first response.  The remaining 5 were not
necessary.  I do not continue to question this point.
But I might point out that companys doing business on the net might not
like having the details of their day to day transactions sniffable, as you
can build quite a good business intelligence profile from that type of
info.  As can the IRS, FBI, etc.  Nor would they appreciate being spoofed...
I strongly suggest you take another serious consideration of implementing
encryption *now* rather than later, as your current scheme is not
thorughly protecting the privacy of individuals or organizations until you
do. - -NetSurfer

The normal clear transmission mode of GPS is intentionally "granulated." It was during ODS that the "granularity" was turned off rather than on. This was to allow them to purchase commercial GPS equipment for use in the
Gulf theater.  It could simply be a return to that standard mode.
