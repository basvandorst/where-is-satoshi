@_subject: Help! New Remailer? 
Hello all Cypherpunks!
I want to set up an anonymous remailer in Norway.
I once had one, but after formating my hard disk - it's no longer Why you ask? There are so many remailers as it is? Well, I think that it is important to have remailers in different countries. It's a little harder for the american FBI/NSA/CIA/whatever to shut down a foreign remailer.
But now there is so many to choose from...
What is the diffrence between Hal's, Sameer's, Nates' and hh's I have seen that hh's? remailer at soda.berkeley.edu can post to newsgroups. Do I need a SMTP-NNTP gateway to use this remailer WITH the option to post to newsgroups?
Can all of these remailers use PGP-encryption?
I'm sorry if this is newbe questions for some of you, but there are surely others who also wants to know.
Thanks for helping me out!

This is disturbing news!
I'm sorry for any spelling errors here.
Please read on!
Would this guy told Brad if he could? I'll newer use that remailer I think appinions change from here you live. I live kind of close up to Russia (Live in Norway). Norway is a sosialistic(?) country and we actually had the World War II here, so we have felt, and can see what the freedom of speach is. So Imagine that I am an Albanian citisen(?) and have some disturbing news about the Albanian goverment. I post this news to the world through this remailer. Wouldn't I be breaking a law by doing this? Yes, I would! Use your brains! Wouldn't this news be of importance for the world? And to you trigger-happy americans: What if the news about the invasion of Quwait came from Iraq trough an anon remailer? Wasn't that of "importance for the world"?? Or did you americans loose so many lives for nothing?
The world is at war! And I would allow nearly any action to distribute information! Eaven if this means that sombody is using my remailer to break the law by distributing copyrighted information.
Ok, if the police come and wake my up an morning with an warrant, they might still need me to get the information they are looking for. (I like encryption!) If the warrant was about kiddy-porn I might give the police what they wanted, but not before I saw the warrant! If they wanted some politicaly mail from Russia/Albania I would rather low-level formated my harddisk!
This Brad-person didn't bring a warrant! So I would have told him to put his nose somhere else! Sorry but my world is black an white (At least a norwegian saying!) Look at the Subject again. "my remailer taking some (mild) heat"
If you dont know how to handle the mild heat, how would you handle the glowing heat?
I'm sorry if this was a little to hard on some of you, but this is my appinion. Halvor Kise jr. (which is putting an remailer up soon)

@_subject: Re: Remailers 
(with reference to Scott Collins catalyst-remailer):
I think you're missing the point.  He doesn't keep logs so that nobody
can try to force him to reveal someone's identity.  It provides a very
convienient excuse. :)  And it certainly reinforces my trust in the
remailer to protect my anonymnity.
This is the reason that we have tried so hard to get remailers all over
the world.  Unfortunatly, with one exception, all our remailers are in
the United States.  If someone was sending copyrighted material through
my remailer, and the AP got upset about it, they could do a lot to
harass me, as I'm sure they have contacts with people at this
university, since they are a large American-based news agency and have
offices in this area.  If some Albanian or Norweigen government person
started complaining, I could basically tell them to take a hike (or less
idiomatically, ignore them and tell them to go away).  They certainly
aren't going to take a trip across the Atlantic just to come over here
and make trouble for me because of a few politically incorrect messages,
and I doubt they could seriously interest the government here with their
own polticial problems.  This is why I strongly encourage you to set up
a remailer in Norway.  If we can have many remailers distributed
throughout the world, the chances of political pressures threatening the
remailers is diminished.
