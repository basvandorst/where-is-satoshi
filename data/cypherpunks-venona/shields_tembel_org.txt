I think there are two major differences between credit cards and digicash
that affect the pricing structure.
1. Applicability
We think of eventually using digicash for everything.  You wouldn't just
use it to pay Sears for a sweater, but Sears would use it to pay for the
wool and for their taxes.  A 5% hit may be ok for the final transaction,
but it's impossible if you incur it every time money is exchanged.
Credit cards are mostly consumer items and don't have this problem as
much, and the states have invented resale licenses specifically to exempt
you from paying sales tax at every step.  I realize that digicash is being
marketed as a consumer item, but I'd like to see it eventually become a
standard banking instrument.  I certianly trust it more than I trust EFT.
2. Float
Cash schemes are unique in that while your money is in the ecash mint,
the bank has the use of it.  Don't underestimate the importance of this
in a high-volume business; if digicash were popular, the banks would
cut their margins to the point where this would probably be the major
source of revenue.  But it would be substantial.
I think digicash out to be priced comparably to traveller's checks.
That is what they are closest to.

(Hopefully someone will correct me if any of this is wrong.  But it
would be nice if the thread ends.)
Here's how it works, politically.  IANA is the ultimate custodian of
the namespace.  IANA has delegated administrative control of the six
traditional top-level domains (TLDs) to the InterNIC.
The InterNIC is a building in my zipcode.  It's in a mundane industrial
park they share with PSI.  It is operated by NSI, which is owned by SAIC,
and funded by an NSF grant and the new domain charges.
Here's how it works, technically.  Your nameserver, if it doesn't
know how to jump into the middle of the tree (via cached data, or the
preconfigured servers for the local domain and the root), will start at
the top of the tree and walk down.
The root nameservers are run by volunteers.  There are nine.  One is
at the InterNIC, but it need not be.  The others are at ISI, PSI, UMD,
NASA, UUNET (ISC), DDN, the Army Research Lab, and NORDUnet (in Sweden).
(The most central point is actually Paul Vixie, maintainer of BIND,
the software used for almost all nameservers, including the roots.
UUNET funds BIND development.)
If the InterNIC yanked your domain, this would *not* affect your IP
connectivity -- your ability to be reached by any Internet protocol via
IP address.  The InterNIC has nothing at all to do with that.
I'm much more worried about a lack of competency at NSI than I am about
the FBI asking them to pull the plug on troublemakers, especially since
it would be taken very seriously if you had a legitimate complaint
about unjust termination (and some people, upset at having to pay for
their domain(s), are looking for any reason to tear into the InterNIC's

Bell Atlantic, who they are already friendly with, and have them make

This is silly.  If the NSA were monitoring traffic with the consent of
EUnet and UUNET (and note that EUnet is owned by UUNET rival PSI), they
wouldn't need to play these routing games; they'd just eavesdrop at an
interconnect or on the leased lines leading into it, run a rough filter
over it to cut down volume, and tunnel the traffic home through other
channels (probably satellite).  And if they were monitoring without the
consent of UUNET and EUnet, they still wouldn't play these games because
the providers would be upset about the unexpected load on the expensive
and overloaded transatlantic pipes.
Finally, we all know how easy sniffing is at the local (LAN, ISP LAN,
and especially telco) level.  And we know that end-to-end encryption
is the way to go.  So what would we have learned if we knew the NSA
was eavesdropping?

@_subject: Timed-release crypto and information economics 
1. Method
In 1993, Timothy C. May posted a message to this list
 with some thoughts on
time-release crypto.  I think his system is too complex.  Here I present
a cleaner model, and show how it can be used in several real-life ways.
In the May proposal, when you have a message to be encrypted, you
encrypt it with a session key, optionally split that key with an n-of-m
scheme, and then send the key into a network of escrow agents, which are
instructed to hold the message for a given period of time.  You then
hold onto the encrypted message, though you need not keep it secret.
Conceptually, you have encrypted a message and then remailed the key to
yourself in such a way that it will take X length of time to arrive.
I have a simpler, public-key plan.  When you want to keep a message
secret until date X, you ask your favorite crypto house to generate a
key pair and hold the secret key until date X.  You then encrypt your
message with the public key, and again hold onto the encrypted message.
N-of-m trust management can be implemented by secret-sharing your message
and encrypting each with a key generated by a different crypto house.
This method is clean, fully anonymous, and nearly stateless.
2. Economics
I've worked out a payment model for both the public and secret key, which
I think can be used for any sort of information in an information economy
not based on (increasingly unenforceable) intellectual property laws.
In this model, the creator of information charges enough to recover
his costs (call this price, the price available to the first buyers,
the "primary cost").  It is then possible for resellers to purchase
it and try to make a profit through multiple sales at a lower price.
If the reseller is hoarding the information, another one can step in,
pay the same initial rate, and try to do better.
This model seperates marketing of information from producing it, and gives
an easy way to profit from doing either.  Of course, it's possible to
conflate them into a information creator that sells directly to end-users.
Once you abstract this you'll notice that (a) it's much like existing
models for those who create information for hire, such as writers and
programmers who sign over copyright but could recreate the work; and
(b) it can be applied to many less extreme scenarios, such as where the
reseller makes the product available but under a restrictive licence.
I think this is the basic fabric of an information economy.
Applying it to the selling of timed-release pairs, the primary cost
of the public key is some nominal charge, and the primary cost of the
secret key is the amount required to judge whether or not it should be
released -- a trivial amount for time-based release but something more
for event-based release.  (A corollary is that you might pay the judging
fee for a secret key, and receive instead a certificate saying that it
cannot yet be released.)
3. Applications
* Bonds: You deliver $1000 in ecash to the issuer.  In returns it gives
  you a unique certificate redeemable for $1100, encrypted such that
  it may not be decrypted until the maturity date.  You also get a
  certificate saying that your encrypted bond is a bond, so that you
  may demonstrate fraud if you find something else once you decrypt
  it at maturity.  Essentially this is the same as creating a private
  corporate ecash bank.  Coupon bonds are a trivial extension.
* Retirement plans, cryonics funds, and wills: You encrypt your assets
  or your will in a custom event-based key, and archive it with your
  executor.
* Idea futures: You have a pair of key pairs generated, one for
  encrypting YES coupons, and the other for NO coupons.  Now anyone
  can generate and sell their own coupons, consisting of $1 in ecash
  encrypted with a YES or NO event-release key, again with a certificate
  of authenticity to verify fraud.
* Bonding: You pay $1001 for a reputable institution to give you a $1000
  bond encrypted in the event-release key based on your breech of
  contract, and its complementary negative key, and send you and the
  other party each one bond.  If you default on your contract, the
  injured party can ask the crypto house to release the default key;
  if you do not, you can ask the crypto house to release the other key.
4. Cypherpunks write code
I'll let everyone tear into this for a few days, and then I'll put up a
server for timed-release key generation, charging maybe c$1.  I'd like
to then enhance it to be capable of issuing bonds and loans denominated
in c$.  (I like the cyberbucks trial because it's officially play money,
so there aren't any regulatory burdens.)  This should be interesting.

Sorry.  But still, then intent was to be user-friendly (right?), and
a side effect was to make it possible to renumber without anyone noticing.
Renumbering didn't affect the health of the net until recently, with
CIDR, where blocks of IP addresses could be aggregated arbitrarily.
A provider might now get 10.11.12/22 (i.e., a 22-bit-long prefix), and
then assign customers 10.11.12/24, 10.11.13/23, &c., with only one entry
in the backbone routing tables.  To make this work you have to renumber
when you change providers.  Fortunately, we have DNS to provide a name
more stable than the IP address.
That's the connection between DNS and routing, and it's why using names
instead of numbers is Good.

@_subject: Re: Timed-release crypto and information economics 
In article ,
Here are some attacks where my scheme is more resistant.  I'll suppose
that Alice is writing a bond, i.e., time-delayed cash, to Bob.
1. Alice does not really write a bond
In my plan, Alice gives Bob the message along with a certificate saying
that it is a bond.  If the message is actually not a bond, Bob can
demonstrate fraud upon the maturity date without revealing his identity,
by posting the now-readable message along with the contradictory signed
statement from Alice.
In your plan, Alice cannot provide the actual message to Bob, nor
prove that she even sent anything through the blind remailer network.
Bob would have to ask her to sign a certificate saying that she wrote
a bond to Bob for $n to mature on date X; she may not be willing to
admit that in a publicly demonstrable way.  And if she defrauded Bob,
he cannot prove he did not receive a bond.
2. The crypto houses lose keys/messages
In my plan, the crypto house's signature on the public key it issues
guarantees that the secret key will be available upon the maturity date.
If the house loses the secret key, then anyone can prove this, again
anonymously, by publishing the signed public key and asking anyone to
try to purchase the corresponding secret key.  The house cannot say it
is a false claim.  The unreliable house hemorrhages reputation, and Bob
still has his money as long as n houses were reliable.
In fact, even if Bob ca'n't trust n houses, he can still hedge.  He would
just buy a futures coupon saying that the house in question will lose
a key.  This is a classic use of hedging, and it allows him to recover
his money, anonymously.
In your plan, you just have to hope the remailers don't lose more than
m-n parts.  You rely on reputation-raters to judge reliability in a
probabilistic manner.  This works ok currently, with amateur remailers,
but not in a future world held to the 100% standards of financial
reliability.  (And those standards are very high.  Consider the public
reaction if you saw proof that a bank had "lost" someone's checking
account, one among a million.)
3. The crypto houses leak keys/messages
In my plan, this is ok.  You need both the keys *and the message*
to decrypt.  Only Bob holds the message.  (It's axiomatic that you can
keep a secret out of self-interest; your personal private key is such
a secret.)  In fact, at the maturity date, the secret keys will become
available to anyone, and Bob still won't be hurt.
Meanwhile, crackers have incentive to steal keys even without breaking
messages, because they can use them to make a profit on "Megahouse leaks
keys" futures, by posting the secret key matching a signed public key.
This can be anonymous, or they can use it to raise their nym's reputation
among crackers.  Because Megahouse knows it will be caught *every time*
it leaks, it must keep 100% financial-quality security.  This is an
excellent failure mode because all failures will be public.
In your plan, you just have to hope fewer than n pieces are made available
to the cracking ring.  And when you get a bond consisting of double-spent
bills, you ca'n't tell who broke security.  This is intractable for a
reputation-rater to determine to the necessary standards of accuracy.
4. Alice leaks the message
This is "fraud through negligence" and is treated as in case 1.  If Bob
thinks it's likely, he can hedge by buying a "Alice shown untrustworthy"
futures coupon.  (Those will be *so* useful.)
Because of the two-part design of a delayed message, it takes collusion
by those in possession of ciphertext *and* keys to unseal a message.
Before the maturity date, only Alice and Bob have the message, and only
the banks have the keys.  The message is of value only in that it will
be valuable in the future along with the then-available secret keys.
(Or, I suppose, possibly to prove fraud; that's of even more value.)
All collusion can be righted, everything is anonymous unless reputations
are involved, and all fraud is publicly exposed.
These are interesting properties.

True "timed-release crypto" isn't possible with pure mathematics,
because time never appears in mathematical equations.  Time does appear in
physical equations, so it's conceivable that a device could be built that
really wouldn't divulge a secret for a given length of time.  However,
I'm not sure how such a device would work, and I'm not sure it would be
practical for long periods (longer than a human lifetime).
What I'm really proposing is "event-release" crypto based on reputation,
with checks and balances so that you can minimize the necessary level of
trust and prove breach of contract.  I think this is a useful service,
because you can convince yourself that in practice, it wouldn't be
profitable for the crypto houses to default, nor for an attacker to
compromise every house.
Once you have event-release crypto, time-release is an easy special case,
with zero human interaction and thus fast turnaround and low cost; but
"the beginning of the twentyfirst century" is just an event, as is "my
death" or "a horse with exactly three vowels in its name wins the 1996
Kentucky Derby".
I'm writing code for Tembel's Crypto House now, so I can get an empirical
grasp on this.
I don't see how this could work, considering that once there are copies
of a message in circulation among nontrusted parties it is impossible
to destroy the information.  Also, it's impossible to verify that an

What have you gained?
The point about moving the elements of the message physically apart has
merit, though.  So the one-time pad of timerel, the ideally secure but
unworkable model, is to encrypt your message with an OTP, then securely
transport the pad and location to points that are $ct$ metres apart,
where $t$ is the length of time you want to keep your message secret.
You could do this with a reflector $ct/2$ metres away, assuming your
opponent and you are in the same location.
I suppose this could be useful for very short-term applications (for

of the messages, but even of the messages' existance -- nothing at all
