@_subject: Re: zip version for pgp2.2? 
I dnloaded pgp22.zip from soda and used pkunzip 2.04g to decompress it
without a hitch. Looks like it might be your version of pkzip. Of course
if you didn't use binary for the ftp that would mess it up also.

I had no problems with the version at soda using pkunzip v204g. Worked the
first time.

@_subject: Mac PGP on The Well 
I was just reading in the EFF conference on the Well that they have asked that the pgp version for the mac be removed ...at least temporarily because of the possible legal problems. I don't use a mac and already have a copy thankak you anyway
