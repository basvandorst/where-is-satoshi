YIKES!   Think again.  Many of the *.test newsgroups have auto-responders
that remail the poster assuring them their post was received.  This feature
is used to make sure your newsfeed is working.

I cannot speak for what algorithms are used in the devices, but someone made
a low-tech analysis and hack for these machines a while back.  He noticed
that a certain brand of keno machine reseeded its random number generated
with a constant each time power to the machine was lost.  Unfortunately he
hit the same casino three times (the stainless steel rat says always be
prepared to walk away no matter how much is at stake to steal again
another day) and he was forced to divulge his method.  The machine were
consequently fixed.  I doubt those machines use crypto strength RNGs because
who is going to spend the time, energy and money to hack a .25c slot machine?
The payout is too small.   For an excellent real-world example of this try
'The Eudaemonicus Pie.'  Briefly, its a book about people who successfully
hacked roulette machines but at a net loss because of all the time and
energy spent developing their technique.

- Uses Public key crypto but web pages do not mention PGP,
     says keys may come in mail on floppy; how to fingerprint key?
  -  Online only based system
      Drawbacks include system downtime means being unable to
      access your 'checkbook'
      No extraction features for those of us who use true double entry
      accounting systems, much less Quicken or even spreadsheets.
  - Bill paying system
      Four day lead on bills to be paid (can you say float?)
      Laser-printed statement sent to payee for 'verfication'
       will be subject to payees security restrictions which may
       consist of tossing it unshredded into the trash.
  - No chaum-like digital money provisions.
Although it is a step in the right direction, I won't be happy until the
bank accepts e-mail directives for generating chaumian cash or
instant EFT payments via messages encrypted against PGP keys.
Lets face it FINCEN already knows all about your income sources
if they are at all bank based (i.e. excluding barter and cash), but at
least I can have my check EFT'd, encrypt a PGP transaction to send
all my money to Seychelles, and pay bills from that Offshore bank
that really does respect my privacy.  This would at least make discerning
that my foley's bill is $120 a month more difficult since FINCEN would now
have to have cooperation from the payee.

Or more to the point, a presidential address. Just kidding.  You want to monitor 'the other side' in any situtation,
just as The FBI and NSA must have people watching this group.

You though that was bad?  (Besides I though it was $300/yr not a quarter)
try their clearing services!  $500/mo + 6% of all tranactions.  Yeoch.
 I know T1s and satellite links overseas are  expensive, but they're not THAT expensive.  Hey, Mark Twain.  Form a seychelles entity with the same fee
schedule as your U.S. counterpart.  You won't know what to do with all
the money!
