Agreed.  PGP is too much of a good thing for me to withraw my support
for it without a much more compelling reason than this.  As Tim May stated, we should be careful to see who there real enemies are here.
PGP is certainly not one of them.
I certainly do not want to be RSA Data's "enemy", but from the indications
on here that they are actively working against PGP, and are not likely to
support any similar, freely-distributable product (and that would require
a substantial length of time to develop!) PGP is currently the best, and
only, possibility.  Now, if there were some program without the legal problems that PGP has which was at least very affordable and could reasonably be expected to gather the same widespread use that PGP already
has, ideally through complete compatibility with PGP keys, I think we
would all agree on using it.  Tim May:
It would be nice if PGP were universally supported, and legal.  That,
as far as I can see, is its only problem.  I do not see how we are going to come up with a solution to that problem without sacrificing
much of PGP's availability and utility.  If not PGP, then what?  Until
there is a concrete and acceptable alternative to work towards, which
seems unlikely if RSA will not support it, we must work with what we have.

How does the 'tamperproof' nature of the software help at all?
It's still possible to double-spend in any off-line cash system
by making multiple copies of the tamper-proof modules.. the only
security provided is in obscuring the algorithm.
Speaking of digital cash, many thanks to the author of the
'magic money' software.  I am in the process of integrating it
with a local bulletin board, which should hopefully be available
on the net sometime this summer.  :::*::: Jeremy S. Day.
