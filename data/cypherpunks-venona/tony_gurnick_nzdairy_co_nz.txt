Can anyone tell me where I can get a copy of
PGP for vms?  AXP or VAX.

@_subject: Timestamping 
Could the cypher punks automatic signing
also be used as a distributed timestamping service?
Where you send a hash/document to it and it timestamps
and signs it, to the fact that this hash was in existsence
at the specified time.  Then it would forward your message
on to another such service picked at random until the hash
has been stamped the number of times you specified.  If you
collect a number of timestamps from around the world you
could make a case for a document existsing at a certian time.
You could also back & forward link in time to other documents
that each timestamp services has stamped!
Any comments????

I`m looking for an ftp site for pgp 2.6.2 or greater
outside of the us.  Ive tried ftp.dsi.unimi.it but
they only have 2.6.1.

If you really want to test NSA.  Encrypt some crypto code
with pgp in an overseas public key(IE: non-us) then email the
code to someone out of the us.  This way you will find out 1 of 2
       1.  That pgp is unbreakable by the NSA
          - Rsa with fairly log keys take so much work the nsa
            cant crack it with huge computers.  This is a good
            thing
          - Idea, even though it is new, is a secure algorithm
            for the above reasons
          - You wont get in trouble as you are only sending
            random bits out of the country not code
       2.  PGP is BREAKABLE by the NSA (OUCH!)
          - You get in deep shit!
      or
       3. PGP is breakable by the NSA but they dont tell anyone! (HMMM)
            first place (them or the us gov) they have a prob!  If
            they knew you were exporting crypto because they cracked
            pgp they could not convict you as that would imply they cracked
            pgp and they would tell the whole world what they can &
            cannot crack.  It would be a big bummer for RSA and IDEA

    Not that easy. They would just crack the code and *another*
    acronym based agency would come up with a different reason to
    seize you and your computer. It would seem unrelated to anyone
    but *you* since you would know what you did but would have no
    way to prove that your original infraction is why you are doin'
    time.  Hope that makes some sense.
Maybe.  What if the only way to do this was illegal?
    If it isn't something *really good* they probably wouldn't come after
    you anyway.
Whats the definition of GOOD?
     I can agree with. I don't think that NSA would tip their hand
    and let on to us that they can read our stuff. At least, not directly.
We may as well find out.
    One more thing. Don't you think that they subscribe to the Cypherpunk
    list just to see this kind of logic?
Maybe, But isnt freedom of speech what this list is about and what your
constitution does!
    BTW....I ain't one of 'em, and I wouldn't tell if I was.   :)
Prove it

Um, you would still know pgp/rsa/idea has been broken???
Yeah Thats pretty good
 Huh?
 Well Im not one (a us cit i mean), but another way of putting what I said is
 Its like some private company invents a cipher
 and you break it
 And they get pissed at you for doing it.
 But you did them a favour really cause someone more unscrupulous than you wouldnt
 have told them.
 So the NSA should be glad, and encourage us to speak like this and I think we should
 continue along this track!
 Unless of course they wish to comment....?
Sorry, I forgot my smile, I was quite busy yesterday and thought I could get a quick
reply in.  I bolloxed that up!  Heres two  ))
Thats a good one

@_subject: Anonymous Repository 
To solve anonymous replys heres a little scenario.
Alice wants something from bob (crypto?) but dosent want bob to know
(or any others (NSA?)) to know.
1) Alice sends a request to bob via and anon-remailer chain.
2) In the request she specifiys that bob is to put a special code
   in the message and send it to anon-repostiory
3) Bob sends the info + the special code,
   for whatever reason.  (Payment recieved?)
4) Alice sends a message to anon-repostiory saying to
   copy bobs message (using special code) to a new secret special
   code (here code represents a file name)
   - This message could/should be encrypted and the repository
     should delete it after the copy is made.
5) At some indetermined time in the future alice ftp`s or sends a mail
   message to anon-repostiory and retrives bobs message.
This should defeat traffic analysis but will do nothing if the repository
is compromised!  But the same goes for anon-remailers.
There are huge blanks in this, so does anyone want to comment?

Does any of the kiwis on the list want to start

Well thats 2 replys,  Man it`s going to be packed! :)
When a meeting happens what do we discuss?/do?
 - an obvious one would be NZ crypto!
 - New crypto ideas?
 - NZ Anon remailers & Repositorys
 - Patents??? (maybe not)
 - Cryptanalasis  (Hopefully, oh please-oh please)
  Um, what else
PS:  Why do we need a workstation? (probably a dumb question)

Pick your RSA key size:
    1)   512 bits- Low commercial grade, fast but less secure
    2)   768 bits- High commercial grade, medium speed, good security
    3)  1024 bits- "Military" grade, slow, highest security
Choose 1, 2, or 3, or enter desired number of bits: 2048

You need a user ID for your public key.  The desired form for this
user ID is your name, followed by your E-mail address enclosed in

thing.  We could have our own NZ kiwi cypherpunks mailing list!
Oh, what we would talk about! :)
Oh, Thanks to all who helped me with the 2048 bit keys.  I thought
it was the 15-dec-94!  Anyway I changed the source a bit so now
I can generate 16384 bit keys.  On the other hand trying to gen
a 2048 bit key with this modified code just failed so maybe I`ll
have to wait!!! (shiiit!)  I cant set the clock on our machines.
