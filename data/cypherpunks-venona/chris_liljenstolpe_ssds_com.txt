Please get a clue before designing crypto or allowing your marketing
people loose on the net.
This smells of snake-oil and your pages are full of inacuracies:
1) What is Internet-compatable (PGP works fine over the net, but it is
not).  If you mean RFC or other standard compatable (i.e. MOSS,
S/MIME, PEM), you aren't conformant to any standards.
2) 22 character Public keys are a joke
3) No crypto system is unbreakable unless you are doing some
permutation of OTP.  Public key systems are definately compromisable
with the appropriate application of compute power.
If you do not have a clue, don't play with those that do.

@_subject: Re: domain name zapping threat by Internic 
do this since they talked about charging.  The fee structure is:
1) New registrations cost $100 for two years
2) Renewals cost $50 for one year
Anyone could put in a record for a dead domain in their nameserver, if
they wanted to, the InterNIC can't tell you what you can and can't do
(nor will they), however:
1) It would only benefit you and the people who use your nameserver
for their resolver
2) If the InterNIC re-issued that name to another entity, you would
not be able to access that entity
3) You would be breaking the hierarchical nature of the DNS space
The InterNIC feeds all of the root name servers for the 5 common (US)
There has been a large amount of talk about alternative root name
My guess is that you will never see a free one however, as equipment
has to be bought and maintained, staff hired (I don't want my root
name space managed by someone who is only available on weekends or
evenings - I don't know about anybody else), space provided, net links
funded, etc.  This is what the InterNIC is supposedly spending the
money on (as well as trying to limit the explosion of TLD registries).

am, technically, but am on the road about 98% of the time as the chief
security engineer for SSDS, a integration house.
would not have to relocate.  In either case, are you aware of any
INFOSEC related groups that meet in the Minneapolis area?  If not, do
you think that there would be enough interest to support one?

but at this time, the chance of detecting the existance of the tap is
reallistically pretty slim. in the conduit pressure indicates that someone MAY be trying to gain
access to the fiber.  While a pressurized glove-box around the conduit
may allow a break in the conduit to be made without detection, varying
the pressure in the conduit makes that a lot more difficult.  It all
depends on what the value is of the data you are trying to
