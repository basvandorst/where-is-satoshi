If your zip code is listed above then you are one of Rep.  Torricelli's
constitutents.  "part" means your zip code is split between two
districts, one of them Rep. Torricelli's.  Rep. Torricelli is on the
House Intelligence Committee and needs to hear from you about HR 3627,
which would permit cryptography exports.  The attached file explains
all about the bill and why you should support it.
Call Rep. Torricelli today and ask him to send Rep. Maria Cantwell's
bill, HR 3627, to the House Floor!

I phoned the House Rules comm. this morning.  They informed me that
the committee voted 5-4 earlier this week to allow amendments to the
General Export Administration Act on the House Floor.
This should allow a contingent to restore the strength to the act
on the House floor, should Rep. Maria Cantwell and her cosponsors
be able to muster the required votes.
It was obviously a close vote.  If you wrote in, know that your letter
probably helped to tip the scales.

@_subject: 1994 Digital Telephony Bill campaign 
The Voters Telecomm Watch has officially taken a position against
the 1994 Digital Telephony Bill.  It's not that we're slow, but it's
taken time to reach a consensus (and even reach the board members), to
compose all our materials, and gear up for the fight.
In opposing this bill, I hope to exceed our efforts of "watching"
with the Cantwell bill.  If you followed that bill, you'll remember that
we attemtped to notify the Net community before every vote with
accurate information including sample letters, phone numbers,
bill histories, and legislator positions.
We had a few problems (legislators with changing addresses and
phone numbers, voice votes that leave no record that we could tie
to the legislator) but we also had many successes.
We'll be doing the same thing (even better, I hope) this time with
the Digital Telephony bill.  We're going to try something new though.
This message will be sent to all the mailing lists we usually use
on our announce list.  If you have access to news, check the following
(Crossposting will be done carefully, so people with decent newsreaders
 only see these alerts once)
I'll be forwarding this to the following mailing lists, who will be removed
from the vtw-announce mailing list:
Please do not forward this announcement to the above lists, they have
already seen it.  A number of people complained that the political
announcements we were sending were off topic for the lists during the
Cantwell campaign, so I hope this is a reasonable compromise.

S 974 is a silly bill.  It's like someone went around and made a list
of all the things that would irk us and then wrote legislation
around it.
However this bill isn't immediately going anywhere, and there's more
dangerous legislation on the floor that is looking a lot like a loaded
VTW is tracking this bill and will put out alerts on it if it becomes
a more valid threat.  However until then we'll not try to divide the
forces of the net on bills that aren't yet a serious threat.
Read the bill, familiarize yourself with the analyses, but let's not
go running off every time some DC bozo writes a terrible bill.  Especially
when there isn't even a subcommittee hearing scheduled yet.
Let's try and do *one thing* at a time.

[From Sun Tzu?  SUN TZU you say?
Let's not lay siege to this bill prematurely.  Should we call grass roots
supports too early, people will become aggravated with being asked to
act on bills that aren't really a threat.
Let's give the DC folks a chance to convince *those that control the
Congressional schedule* to keep this bill from going anywhere.
Now is not the time to fight this with "call in campaigns".  We haven't
even had time to digest the analyses.  Sure we understand the crypto part,
but should we call Grassley's office, you'll probably get back, "but there
are so many other holes in current law that this bill fixes, how can
you be opposed to it?"
Unaware of the rest of the bill, we'll be caught flat footed.
Look, every net-civlib group in DC is committed to the availability of
strong crypto.  There isn't a one of them who has ever ignored a fight
yet against crypto restrictions.  If several of them (who have really
good resources inside the capital, better than all of us) say that
the bill is NOT going anywhere, and that the best thing to do right now
is to study it and get ready in case it does move, what better
information do you have that convinces you that they're wrong?
We should read the bill, and we should be pissed.  But calling the wrath
of the net down on this bill is wasteful at this stage.  Sure it may get
thrown in as an amendment, that's always possible.  But if that's Grassley's
strategy, no amount of call-in support is going to help, because nobody,
not even that Senator you just called who promised you s/he opposes
AER will know what happened until it is too late.
Let's read the bill and get ready for a fight.  We should hold Grassley
accountable for this next election.  But we're spinning our wheels by
acting against every bill that affects one of our issues.
