If it turns out that pressure to shut down really did come from the official
net hierarchy, there are other places on the net which should be nearly
immune from that kind of pressure.  There are thousands of UUCP sites which
predate the Internet.  And anyone getting their connectivity from one of the
commercial providers (PSI, UUNET, ANS, etc.) can theoretically use those networks for whatever purposes they choose.

@_subject: use of ripem instead of pgp 
Since the only reason we are talking about RIPEM is because of legality concerns about PGP, I thought I'd mention that it is (at least theoretically) illegal to export RIPEM from the US, annd therefore could not be legally used to correspond with persons overseas.
I don't know if there is a legal way to do public key cryptography between persons inside the US and persons outside the US.
