This is half incorrect.  PC DOS was released with a lead time of about
9 months prior to the release of the other O/Ses.  This was enough to
give it a market share it has never looked back on.  There was plenty
of speculation in PC Magazine and Byte that this was *exactly* what
IBM intended all along.  It helped that the alternatives were
delivered as virtual cripples with no support software as well.
The P-System released for IBM PCs was less functional than the Apple
][ version that ran on 64 or 128k with bank switching, even by the
time of DOS 2.0.  About the only application it ever really had was
Context MBA which was quickly overtaken by Lotus 1-2-3 & company.
I wrote three disk device drivers for the Apple ][ UCSD P-System based
on documentation of dubious origin, and hated every second of it.
Much of the interface was hidden, and (on a 6502 remember) reserved
all of the precious 0 page for its own use.  It was a half-interesting
idea, but definitely in the same class with PC-DOS -- How Not to Write
an Operating System.
The Java relevance would be that given the current lead in marketing
Sun has, even if a technically superior solution arose right now, it
might have enough of a disadvantage in lead to never catch up and
become popular.  Technically superior products don't always win, look
at MS DOS/Windows/NT/95 and VMS, albeit from opposite ends of the
technical superiority spectrum.

The term is used commonly in the Linux community due to the

exploders are used to relay outgoing email by domain name.  This has
to mean that the subscriber list is distributed via the exploders,

That is half correct.  It will only create emscrypt.lock if you have

lockf or flock to make the lock.
As Hal pointed out, you will still have one process per message, but
they will be processed one at a time.

Another possibility is to call lockfile (a program included with

You're better off using procmail's locking as it does what you're

This information is preliminary and is based on an attempt to
understand the IPG algorithm information.  That description is not
clear in some areas, however, hence this analysis is tentative at this
First let us describe the IPG system in more conventional C:
a[0] to a[63] are initialized to random 8-bit values.  (The
description is unclear and almost makes it sound like they are
initialized to a random 8-bit value anded with 0x3500, which would of
course be zero.  The attack below will assume that this bizarre step
is not done, but will still apply even if it is.)
b[0] to b[63] are initialized to random primes selected from some
pool.  c[0] to c[63] are also initialized to random primes selected
from a different pool.
d is initialized to a random 8 bit value.
The algorithm is:
    for ( ; ; ) {
    }
Note first that with a known plaintext attack, the value of d can be
calculated for each iteration, simply by xor'ing the plaintext and
ciphertext.  So we can easily recover a series of d values under this
assumption.  Known plaintext is a plausible cryptographic assumption
in many contexts.
Note second that we can assume that b[i] is less than c[i].  It
appears from the description that this will be true, although it is a
little unclear.  If b[i] is greater than c[i] then simply do
b[i] = b[i] % c[i] before beginning the loop.  This will produce the
same results since (a + (b mod c)) mod c is equal to (a + b) mod c.
Note third that when a[i] and b[i], both less than c[i], are added mod
c[i], the result will be equal to one of two things: a[i]+b[i], or
a[i]+b[i]-c[i].  The reason is that the sum a[i]+b[i] must be less
than 2*c[i] so the "mod" operation will be at most a single
subtraction of c[i].  In general, half the time it will be necessary
to subtract c[i], and half the time it will not.
Now, as mentioned above, with known plaintext we can deduce the series
of d values.  Since each d differs from its predecessor by adding
a[i], this allows us to calculate the low 8 bits of a[i] simply by
taking the difference between successive d's.
Every 64 bytes, i repeats.  We know the low byte of a[i] from the
previous iteration, and we know it for this iteration.  Half of the
time (on average) a[i] will change simply by adding b[i], in which
case the low 8 bits will change by exactly the low 8 bits of b[i].  So
if we take the difference between a[i] values spaced 64 bytes apart,
half of the time these values will be a constant which is equal to the
low byte of b[i].
The other half the time, the low 8 bits will change by adding b[i] and
subtracting c[i].  So the low 8 bits of (b[i]-c[i]) is the other
possible constant value which will be seen when you take the
difference of a[i] every 64 bytes.
So with a few multiples of 64 bytes of known plaintext, you will
quickly find all the possible b[i] and b[i]-c[i] low bytes. By itself
this should significantly narrow down the possibilities for b[i] and
c[i], in many cases to a single prime.  Even without this the
algorithm can now be run forward or backward with only two possible
known changes to a[i] at each step, and the entire message can be
easily deduced.
So this algorithm is easily broken with known plaintext.

Well, to one who inserts "(spit)" after nearly every name he cites, and
critiques Hayek as "fucking unreadable. Shit.," I suppose Hayek must indeed
seem unreadable. Shit.
After all, Hayek rarely writes things like: "The senile Von Mises (spit)
and his Sovok Cabal plotters...."
As to "forcing" your students to read Hayek, just who is in charge? If
you're the instructor, they can choose to read what you tell them to read,
or be unprepared on the exams you give and possibly flunk the class. What
part of "Required Reading" do you or your students not understand?

I like the idea, but they've never covered anything other than Usenet,

The little feedback we've gotten after putting it in Gnus indicates
either that it is not useful, or that it probably hasn't reached

I proposed GroupLensing this list to Brad early this year, but he
never followed up on it.
To the luser who unsubscribed last week after complaining about his
wimpy mail program, I would add:
Gnus runs on Emacs 19.34 which fully supports Microsoft Windows and is
available as a precompiled binary, so there is no excuse for using
mail and newsreading software on that platform without threading,
sorting, kill files, etc.  Add in the mailcrypt package and an
up-to-date copy of Raph's remailer list, and you have basically point
