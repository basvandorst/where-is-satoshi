distribution of Secure Drive.  He asked that it not be placed for anonftp just because of the fact that he doesn't want ot run the same kind of risk that PRZ is currently in...

@_subject: TM's comments on my comments 
I agree with Tim's ideas. I was trying to point out that Mike HAD requested that Secure Drive not be exported... Edgar's comments sadi that he had not made any such request.
