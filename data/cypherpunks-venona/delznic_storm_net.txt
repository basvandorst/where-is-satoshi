I have heard that their are alpha releases currentky geing worked on at
quest/qualcomm. But i would have to say before they come out your best bet
to pgp and eudora is either pidaho or just use it in dos. pidaho is a great
front end. A lot better than any others out their.
 I have also heard that ViaCrypt is a good alternative. But I am not sure.
Has anyone else out there heard anything good/bad about ViaCrypt?

@_subject: WIRE TAP ON NET 
E-MAIL-TAP NETS CRIMINALS
The first-ever court-approved wiretap of an e-mail account has resulted in
the arrest of three people charged with running a sophisticated
cellular-fraud ring.  The alleged mastermind, a German electrical engineer,
advertised his illicit wares on CompuServe, where they caught the attention
of an engineer at AT&T's wireless unit.  The Secret Service and the Drug
Enforcement Agency then got into the act and obtained the Justice Dept.'s
permission to intercept e-mail messages between the alleged perpetrator and
his accomplices.  "This case represents the challenges in the future if we
can't get ahead of the curve in technology," says a U.S. attorney, whose
office is prosecuting the case.  (Wall Street Journal 2 Jan 96 p16)

Has anyone heard anything else about this? I am getting real sick of the
media's portrayal of the internet. They never say anything good about it. If
they were to mention C2's system they would say how it is a no-rules server
to hide thugs and pornos from the police. I am getting sick of watching this
trash. The whole realm of the internet and computers and their associated
areas are very dear to me I am sick of the media bludgeoning them to death.

Mr. Peponis,
 I see what you are saying but doesn't it bother you the slightest bit? I
guess it is the principle of the whole thing for me. Look at us. Members of
a group that's purpose is to make computers free. We read hundred's and
hundred's of messages a week talking about crypto and legal stuff, because
we care about what happens on a economic, civil and most importantly a
personal level. I don't know it just bothers me that they are dragging
something so important to me throught the mud. They never mention the good
stuff like the OK City support group page, the use in schools, the
effectiveness of the internet as a research tool. And most of the time their
"internet" is AOL.

It is disgusting to me. I would really like to do something about it. I use
to have a sig file(s) that said:
"The revolution will not be televised but the proceeedings will be available
During the french revolution someone said "Look their is a revolt" And
another replied "No, a revolution." Or something to that affect. But anyway
I say we as a community do something. Look around the potential is here for
something big e.g. C2.org
