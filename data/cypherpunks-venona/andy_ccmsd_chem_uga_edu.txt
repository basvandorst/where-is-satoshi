You're sending out messages, inviting people to visit your web site, but
you're using anonymous remailers because... you don't want people to know
who you are? Then why invite them to your site (or even have a site)? It's
like if I sent out postcards to people with no return address saying,
"Please stop by 1313 Mockingbird Lane for snacks and refreshments. Signed,
A Friend". (Note, this is not my real address.) Only in this case the
postcards don't have any stamps so the people who receive them have to pay
the postage. Which is precisely what you're doing: Sending someone e-mail
costs them time and it often costs them money. Sending it through an
anonymous remailer accomplishes four things: 1) People can't complain to
you to stop sending them mail. 2) It costs us, the International Secret
Cabal of Anonymous Remailer Operators, time and money for no good reason,
because you are sending anonymous mail and not making yourself anonymous.
3) You're pissing off a bunch of people, and the only ones they can take
their frustrations out on or complain to is us. 4) It's giving us a bad
rap, man, and that's the *last* thing the remailer net needs now.
I could care less about your little applet, or what you have to say; in
the words of Thomas Jefferson, "it neither breaks my leg nor picks my
pocket." Until, that is, you start sending it through my remailer, and
*then* you start picking my pocket. The remailers of the world don't exist
to provide non-anonymous anonymous advertising, which you could do just as
well on your own sending forged e-mail headers from netcom.

Well, I hope to have something for you soon. I've been too busy over the
last few months to work on it, but that may be changing. I'll make an
appropriate announcement when it's ready.
I mentioned this in another post, but USENET posts would simply have the
disclaimer and not a delivery notice.
I've made stats/keys/help for dustbin available via WWW at
http(s)?://porky.athensnet.com/~dustman/dustbin. The truly paranoid can
use I have considered the possibility of auto-encrypting to recipients: Encrypt using the recipient's public key if it is on the remailer's
keyring or on the key server (which I can quickly check via http). Two
problems: What if the user generates a new key? Some mechanism needs to
exist for the user to inform the remailer, since it already has a key on
its keyring and won't check the server. And: Malicious users can put
phoney keys on the keyserver so the real user gets encrypted stuff that
they can't decrypt.  Solution: Keys need to be verified by magic cookie
exchange before they are used. Users mail their public keys to the
remailer, perhaps even through a remailer chain. The software gets their
e-mail address from the key ID, sends them an encrypted magic cookie, the
user decrypts with their secret key, mails it back to the remailer (signed
and encrypted). For a very low-risk remailer (more risky than middleman,
perhaps), you could require all recipients to supply PGP public keys
before delivering messages, an interesting twist on "PGP only" :). This
would be great for nym chains, not so great for other things, though the
remailer could resort to middleman operation in the case of recipients who
haven't supplied keys. Dustbin does something related already: If the
recipient is a known remailer, it doesn't chain; otherwise it selects a
remailer to chain through. (Note: I don't consider a USENET group a

I think by definition a middleman always chains through one or more
additional remailers. When I ran dustbin, it was a "smart middleman",
i.e., if the recipient was a known remailer, it wouldn't bother to chain
(remailers rarely complain), otherwise it would chain through a single
remailer. I have a procmail script which does this as well using mixmaster
only (some definitions are missing here): # Smart middle. If not to another remailer, send it through a random mixmaster.
# Mixmaster 2.0.3 compatible.
:0 f
* MIDDLE ?? (on|yes)
*! ? grep "$TO" $RLIST $TYPE2
 $MIXPATH/mixmaster -f -to $TO -l 0 # We made it this far, so send out the mail.
An even smarter middleman would detect PGP messages and deliver those
directly to end recipients, since those people are unlikely to complain
about anonymous mail, and chain if the message was plaintext. The risk
involved with this type of middleman operation should be rather small.

There's some now. medusa is one.  middleman
(reno) might be another (not sure the account is anonymous, but could be).
The only problem with that is the denial-of-service attack you describe
below. I figure if it's already encrypted, delivery is likely to be
welcomed rather than irritating.
Yeah, I had in mind some kind of magic cookie exchange using the submitted
key. Once the cookie gets returned, the keyserver signs the key with a
special signing key which certifies that the key has at least passed the
"cookie exchange" test. The remailer I was working on (I say "was" because
I just have been too darn busy to finish it) would have implemented that
very thing. It's essentially the same thing the nymservers do when
configured to confirm reply blocks, which they always are. Back to the subject: Disposable remailers. It seems the juno remailer
software would be good for this. I'm not sure what the sign-up requirement
are, but it's free. I was also thinking about web-based free mail
services, such as Hotmail and Rocketmail. Receiving mail means having to
parse some HTML, which from the looks of things is do-able but not
trivial. Sending mail might be easier to implement.
Which brings up an interesting idea for an exitman/middleman remailer: Use
a nym or commercial ISP to receive the mail, use throwaway free mail
accounts for delivery (maybe even just plaintext delivery). Hotmail, at
least, inserts an X-Originating-IP:  header, though.  I expect others do
the same. So put your remailer output on a ZIP disk or floppy and run your
delivery on whatever public or semi-public access machine you happen to
get your hands on, once or twice a day.

Ah, but if you only send through the disposable address, who cares? The
actually remailer address should never get seen (except on remailer lists,
of course). You could probably get away with never reading any incoming
mail, so spammers are not a problem.
Hmmm. Someone has recently been forging mail to appear to be from cracker
through something like this (very bad forgery, headers are all wrong).
Sure, Lance won't mind, right? At least, not if we subscribe... ;) Maybe
we need a network of anonymizing web proxy servers... I'm not thinking of an account so much as maybe a PC in a university
computer cluster. Pick one and go. At a big university there should be
several clusters around campus.
It does, but I know The Anonymizer blocks some sites, at their request.
Mindspring cares. My ISP was absorbed by them about two weeks after I
signed up. They say in their terms of service that impersonating someone
else is forbidden, but they specifically allow the use of anonymous
remailers and nicknames. I assume this means forging is frowned upon,
unless you are impersonating someone who doesn't exist, I guess.

@_subject: Re: Risks of using usually-reliable information sources in your  programs 
Incidentally, I think the patches I have for premail would probably
reduce the effects of an attack like this. It adds a
reliability-threshold and latency-threshold. Any remailer more reliable
than the reliability-threshold (recommended: 99.5%) is treated as if the uptime was 100%. Latencies lower than the latency threshold are treated
as zero. On a good day, this means there are several remailers which
will score exactly the same before the shuffling factor is added. The
four spook remailers listed would all score the same as squirrel and
bureau42, which have latencies exceeding 3 hrs:

See  This is not why I came up with the patch. Originally I came up with the
reliability-threshold when I was running as a middleman and wanted to make
sure I was picking good remailers. I find that for chaining, chain lengths
of 1 and 2 tend to be somewhat slower on average than with standard
premail. However, longer chains tend to be significantly faster and even
more reliable. Check out and look at the distribution of remailers selected in chains, and compare
my random chain stats against Raph's. (I have a couple of remailers he
doesn't, AFAIK.)
Agreed, but the danger from attack like this lies with automatic chaining
programs, where the user may not even be aware of what remailers are on
the list, or what remailers were chosen. A PGP-signed version would
improve things, particular if a special signing key is used, and that key
is stored in a separate keyring. This PGP-version may have to be available
separately from the regular remailer list to avoid confusing chaining
I'll see if I can whip up a PGP-signed version of the EFGA remailer list
by the end of the day.

Yes, I find it particularly interesting that the CFV states only that "The
newsgroup is robomoderated to eliminate crossposts and advertisements
only" but does not mention that the robomoderation requires a repliable
(i.e., non-anonymous) e-mail address. (This IS mentioned for the voting

states, "The CFV says people must return an e-mail sent to the address

error; I got the ballot from my local server (<876781691.12806
and it says no such thing, only that it is robomoderated. "Robomoderated"
does not imply that you "must return an e-mail sent to the address from
which [you] make the post". Maybe it says that in the last RFD, but not in
the CFV. At any rate, if for some reason this CFV is approved, I will post
something to comp.org.cauce with the remailer, and when the reply comes
back (yes, the return address is valid), I'll reply to it, so cracker will
be able to post there, until somebody decides, using their "discretion",
to ban posts from the remailer address.
If it were comp.org.cauce.announce, I really wouldn't give a shit about
what the moderation policy is, but it's represented as a group where
"opinions contrary to those of CAUCE are solicited and welcomed," and I
don't have too much confidence that this will be the case.
