It's exactly this tone that I'm afraid of.  Need?  In who's opinion?  While
I might agree that children shouldn't indiscriminately be seeing
potentially disturbing material, the way that I'd state it is: "I'd like my
children to be protected from graphically violent material".  Note that it
would be *my* children that *I* want to protect.  And I have the means to
handle that.  Not that I have kids, but...
It's insidous, the ways that morals get turned into law and regulations.

I don't disagree with you on the effects of this sort of thing on
children. What I don't like, in any form, is a blanket statement like
"children need protection from".....  Or at least in any context where this
protection is mandated.  I see the shift from "children need protection
from violent images" (and all that entails) to "the people need protection
from terrorism" (and that *that* entails).  Yes, there is a real concern in
both of these cases.  But the actions taken as "protection" tend to be as
commensurate as using a sledgehammer to swat flies.
If we have mandated "protection", who is to do the mandating?  The national
government?  No, thank you.  They've got too much power as it is.
Community standards?  Hmm.  Better, but that concept has just recently
taken a broadside hit, at least where the net is concerned.  It'll be
interesting how the Supremes deal with Virtual Communities.

I disagree here -- I've gotten a couple of jobs where my net reputation
preceded me and was the primary motivator for my getting an interview.  I
was also told at one of them to continue posting as I did because they felt
that their reputation was enhanced by mine.  And "cannot make money on the net"?  How do you see this?  Much as I hate
the metaphor, I don't make money on the local highways either, but they're
a part of real life.  I use them to do other things to make money.  Neither
are an integral part of the work that I do, but both make it possible for
me to do the work in a fashion that I can handle (I refuse to live in my
office ever again).
Just because the reputations aren't digital yet, nor is the cash, doesn't
mean that the Net isn't real life.  It's as real as nearby I-94.  And a lot
more interesting and complex.    --   -  david d `zoo' zuhn  -| armadillo zoo software -- St. Paul, Minnesota

@_subject: Re: Carol Anne - C'Punk Poster Person? 
I don't think there's much of a case for 'poster child' status involved.  Users on the Winternet systems (of which I happen to be one) sign an
Agreement stating that they'll abide by Netiquette whenever using internet
services.  Failure to do so can result in termination of service.  This is
Mike's way to limit the amount of time he has to spend dealing with users
who generate flamage.  There was [apparently] another issue involving
reselling of service that I don't have details on, but which is likely to
be related.
Where's the censorship?  I don't see it.  CarolAnne is free to make
whatever statements she likes (since she has service from another
provider).  The New York Times doesn't have to allow me to put an article
on page one (much as I might wish to do so).  That's not censorship either.
No one is obligated to provide a soap box for someone to stand on.
This is a free market issue, not free speech.  Since there is competition
in the local area, people are free to choose whichever provider they like.
Some have more explicit AUP's than others.  Some probably haven't even
considered the issue.  There's no one crying "Foul!  Begone from the net
forever".  THAT would be censorship.  But this is a case of "You're not
following my rules.  Be gone from my machine."
I've got my own setup at home, mostly independent of network provider and
becoming moreso as time progresses, to prevent J. Random Sysadmin from
cutting me off arbitrarily.  It costs more money this way, but that's not
entirely unreasonable.  I'd rather see a market of half a dozen or more providers in any given
area, each mostly independent, providing a number of choices as to service
levels and policy expectations, instead of a monolithic Micro$oft (or AOL
or CI$ or Delphi or etc) "We ARE the Internet" where censorship (in the
traditional definition of someone vetting any public [or private!]
postings) is much more common.
I could see a market for service where someone who decided to armorplate
their machine could provide service to those who persist in doing
"net.stupid.things".  Provide anonymous accounts on that machine, and
remailer accounts, and such, and then stand back and ignore all of the
flamage that will come the way of root|postmaster|usenet|whatever.
[ Personally, I'd likely put that domain into my global killfiles, but
  that's selective reading, not censorship.  ]
[ More disclaimers -- I don't represent Winternet in any way, nor Mike
  Horwath nor CarolAnne Braddock.  I have no connection with Winternet
  except as a customer.  I speak solely for myself and Armadillo Zoo
  Enterprises. And I'm not afraid of an electronic stalking prosecution. ]

@_subject: Re: The Remailer Crisis 
Around here (in the Twin Cities) one can get a dedicated connection for
$100/month without any startup fees.  And of course one can set up a local
network and use the machine with the modem link as a router.
Having one of these dedicated lines, I'd be happy to host remailer-boxes at
my site.  Ideally, they'll be small & only require a network cable and a
power cord.  I'm also willing to seriously consider initiating remailer-accounts on my
machine.  If you'd be interested in a remailer account, drop me a line.

Looks straightforward to me.  Any time a bulk key is generated (aka session
key), take a known number of bits in a known location (top n or bottom n)
and encrypt those with the public key of the agent you want to give the n
key bits to. Then send the encrypted key bits as part of the message protocol. This is similar to what Netscape's SSL does, except that the top n bits of
an SSL key are a public part of the exchange, and the top n bits of a Notes
key are only readable by the private key holder (which is presumably in the
hands of every major government agency that cares).
Neither give away the entire key directly, so it's not a trivial decoding
operation.  But 40 bits isn't terribly difficult to decode either.
The advantage, as seen by many people, is that the full key is much larger
in the Notes implementation style so non-governmental attackers have a much
harder problem to solve in order to crack the message.  This is roughly akin to what ViaCrypt has announced for their next PGP
release.  You have a public key for the "escrow" agent, and every person
who encrypts using PGP would add (or would have added by PGP) the agent to
the list of recipients.  The message might not be given to the agent, but
if it lands in their hands, they will be able to decrypt it.
GAK is reasonable, to those who trust the government.  Now the subset of
this list who do so may be a much smaller percentage than the subset of the
VPs of IS that do.  But that's a different message.

Probably to satisfy the spirit of the proposed new export regulations that
require a max of 64 bits.  They would have to get US Gov't approval for
this workfactor-reduction export as well, so there could be additional
pressure applied to keep it to 64 bits.  What if the workfactor-reduction
bits got encrypted with a different key that the Gov't didn't have (via a
patch binary for example)?  Then the work is only 64 bits and not 128.
Given the size of the NSA budgets, the equipment to break 64 bits is almost
certainly available.  They'd probably much rather break 2^24 40 bit key
than 1 64 bit key, but they'll do what they have to in order to make sure
they can read the keys.
Memory serves me oppositely -- denial that it has done so in the past and
saying that they would not do so in the future.  This came a couple of
months ago during trade negotiations with the Japanese government.
