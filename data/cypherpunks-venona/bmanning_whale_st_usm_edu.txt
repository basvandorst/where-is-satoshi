Dear users,
        I am an extremely new user to your list, and my interest for privacy
and encryption is extremely new, so please excuse me for this amatuer question.
Could someone please tell me where I could get a copy of PGP software (ftp site)
and the proper way to set it up for windows 3.1 or windows 95.
                                                                Thanks,
                                                                Ben
