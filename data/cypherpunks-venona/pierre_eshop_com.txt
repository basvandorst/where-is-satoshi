Actually, someone asked about Clipper at the CommerceNet launch yesterday. The
question was (paraphrasing):
   "I noticed you've decided to go with RSA for cryptography. How does Clipper
fit into this? [as in, what's your position on Clipper?]"
To which Allan Schiffman, CTO of EIT (the main technical architects of the
CommerceNet system), replied (paraphrasing):
   "Apparently, Clipper is only for voice-encryption, so it has absolutely no
relevance to this system [secure Mosaic]."
This response received a nice smattering of applause from the participants.

[disclaimer: I'm not an expert, but I've done some work with patents.]
I believe the best way to ensure that something becomes unpatentable is to:
  1. Publish it first. That reserves your right to file a patent if you
     want. No one else can patent your original work.
  2. Don't file a patent within one year of publication. After one year
     you lose your right to file. No one else can file, because by then
     the invention is considered to be public knowledge (since it was
     published), so it would not satisfy the "original and novel"
     patentability test.
If you keep the process a secret, someone else could independantly invent it and
patent it. If you publish it before someone else files, it becomes public
knowledge and is unpatentable except by the original inventor within one year of
