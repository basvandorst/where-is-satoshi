@_subject: This list is a joke 
When I subscribed to this list, I thought it would have decent
communication on worthwhile topics.  I've come to realize though that 75%
of the messages I receive are from people whining like 4 year olds.  I am
making a huge assumption in saying that most of the people on this list
are adults.  It is time to start acting like it.
Please take my name off of this list.

Actually, I am not adult enough to save the welcome message I received
when I joined the list.  Thanks to the many people who have since sent me
the instructions.  I am sorry I had to whine to get them.

message I received when I joined the list.  I thought that if I acted like
a jerk someone would get upset and either kick me off the list or at least
give me instructions to do so myself.  I was right.  have learned quite a bit from those who have actually posted worthwhile
mail and would like to thank them.  I realize that a public list is very
hard to maintain, we have just begun offering listservs to our faculty
and we are already having problems.
unsubscribe.  Once again, I am sorry for the whining.
