Correct; here's my two Simoleons' worth toward exorcising the "Churchill
Anguished Over Coventry Bombing" meme:
    The first international conference of cryptologists took place in
    Germany in November of 1978.  The backroom boys of World War II --
    Allied communications intelligence experts and Axis communications
    security specialists -- met under scholarly sponsorship to try to
    determine the effect of codebreaking on the war. [...] Dr. Forrest
    Pogue, author of the standard biography of General George C. Marshall,
    U.S. Army chief of staff, said that [...] 15 to 20 years is the time
    lag for facts to catch up with fiction.  That's how long it will take
    for the false story that Winston Churchill allowed Coventry to be
    destroyed to save the secret of ULTRA "to stop being used to keep
    sophomores awake in the classroom."
  David Kahn, "The ULTRA Conference," Cryptologia, January 1979

The Usual Suspects will congregate today at the Tivoli, and may
visit Majordomo's Net Cafe or other sites of interest.  Anyone
who's not hanging out with Steve Jackson, Larry Niven, et al, at
the Lakewood Sheraton is welcome to drop by; send me a note if
you need directions.

This month we'll meet on Saturday so that a couple of folks will
be able to attend Father's Day festivites.  As always, we'll meet
at the Tivoli; send email for directions.
ps -- I haven't been announcing local meetings to the list because
I unsubscribed for a few months...just thought I'd advise everyone
that this meeting will be on a Saturday.  Besides, info about local
meetings is now available at thanks to some friends who are frequent attendees.
