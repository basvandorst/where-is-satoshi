Yes, as long it was been minted in a recognized form i.e. a gold eagle,
a panda, or gold peso.  A gob of yellow shinny stuff is just that until it has been assayed, and then it is only as good as the backing or reputation of the assayer. My opinion and mine alone, not the companies.........not by a long shot.
