I think there is a partial 'out'.  If a US company is attempting to
interoperate with your code and fails, they can point to the part of a
public specification related to the failure.  Such as our implementations
failed to interoperate related to section n.m.o of rfc wxyz.
But I am not a lawyer, only heard this explaination 3rd hand from a lawyer.
