@_subject: Re: Encrypted TCP Tunneler 
i am using a prog called twinsock to have an internet connection via my shell account. The program provides a winsock for my windows progs and it comes with the complete source. When I first started to use it, I thought that it must be fairly easy to add some packet encryption to this program. But then I realized that it wouldnt work over a tcp/ip connection, only over a telephone line. But maybe the twinsock code might be a good starting point for some encrypting winsock. Unfortunately, I am not a good enough programmer to estimate how much work it is to come up with such an enhanced winsock or even start to make one myself.
