The fact that the key is only 80 is *major* compromise.  I would recommend that package to no-one.   With only a 80 bit key you dont *need* trapdoors, granted they may be more "convienient" but the fact is the 80 key *can* [and certainly will] be broken...
Summary: Don't used it.
Btw, this is not an opposition to RSA, RSA is very good - it is an opposition to the length of the key...

I am a user of SecureDrive, and strongly support it.   There is *no* interface required, once you log into the drive, *everything* operates totally transparent to the user.
Always keep in mind that when the gov't doesn't mind the software being exported, they alrady know how to compromise it...Trust PGP, Hpack & SecureDrive...you won't be disappointed.

Please feel free to ad my key to your keychain and/or keyserver.
I am a cyberpunk in the most original sense.  From the early '80s the days of 8BBS & 414's, etc.   I am also in the book "CyberPunks" [now in your book store] see who signed my key, and you'll have a clue who I am.
Enjoy the key!

Se sure to test it first, sometimes it records who *really* sent it as well as the "forged" return address.
Test it by mailing to yourself and then look at all the headers.

Yes, it is my bet that there are some patriots in this list.  The desire to protect one's privacy is a very "patriot" thiung to want to do.  CyPherpunks appears to be a lot of peole who are against big brothert government, and quite probably for restoring the constitution...am I right?

No wonder they dont want it out!  They look like tey belong in the funny-farm....Have you ever seen those cute uniforms they wear?  [really!  Hollywood california, I have *been* to their "church"]   especially the girls, reminds me of school-uniforms, but they are all so grown up [yum!] but with the minds of a moron....[see above drivil they read]
I know this is somewhat off-topic, but I just *had* to say it!

Nope.  but the patriots & the cyPHerpunks share a common goal, and belief that it is none of the government's business what we think or want to share with our computers.
 > > The desire Yes it is.  This list is for anyone who wants to preserve their privacy, but I do understand what you really meant.  :-^)
Agreed Again, I agree with you Perry.   In fact on a crypto-note [is that a word?] I would enjoy some discussion on SecDrv 1.4....anyone wanna take about it v. PGP?  [is it as secure as PGP?]

You should consciously be aware that the U.S. Government *will* break it's own laws to further it's goals.  You should know that such as law as "this shall be the law unless the fuhrher disagrees andf then what the furhrer says shall be the new law"  [yes, such a law was in Nazi Germany's lawbooks]  in the states we call it "Executive Order" and with the U.S. beiong one of the most powerful outlaw governments on this planet, you should watch them anyway.  Dont count on your citizenship or location outside of the US as protecting you.   If they want you, you are dead-meat.  You know it too!
BTW, if you are going to say 'well the US has a Constitutioon, we'll we *dont* it was suspended in 1933...
