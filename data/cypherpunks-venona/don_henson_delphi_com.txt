Has anyone considered forwarding and/or send NPR an information packet to
help bring the encryption/clipper issues to the general public, or is that
looked upon as a bad idea?
I'm in favor of getting the word out on the Clipper/Skipjack problem but I don't think sending a note to NPR is going to do it.  They have a long history of extremely biased (toward the government view) reporting.

Just a quick question on network etiquette.  Shouldn't it be considered bad form to post a PGP-encrypted message (readable by only one person) to a list like Cypherpunks?

@_subject: Posting Long Documents 
In the interest of saving money (for those of us who have to pay for our internet access), please DO NOT post long reference documents, such as the 'ASCII version of ECPA' directly to the list.  A much better way to get this information out would be to post an anonymous FTP site where the document can be obtained.  Would appreciate muchly.

->
Hey 'punks.
Anyone know of an elementary primer on digital cash?  I'm trying to get up
to speed on this.
I would like an elementary primer also.  How about posting the info to the list vice just to Shari.

@_subject: Cypherpunk Cause 
The following was posted by L. Detweiler as an example of a typical response to his cypherpunk postings: -->
If there is no cypherpunks cause or movement, please let me know.  Being able to interact with people who believe in the cypherpunks cause is the only reason I subscribe to this list and if there is no cause, I would like to unsubscribe and spend my time elsewhere.  Can we have a simple survey of the list?  If you believe there is a cypherpunks cause and you believe in it, please post a short note to that effect to the list.  Anyone who is interested can keep count.  I suppose to be fair, you should also post a note if you believe there is no cause.

What the hell are you talking about? Well, I thought I was pretty clear in the first place so if you don't know what I am talking about, I guess I don't know either.

What difference will any of this make?  It is completely off topic for
the list.
This was pretty typical of the response I got to my question about the cypherpunks cause.  Apparently, I misinterpreted the intent of the list.  Thanks for clearing it up for me.  Goodbye.

@_author: Yuck! 
@_subject: CyberDesk 
A recent article in CompuServe Magazine concerning encryption made passing mention of a Nan Atwell of CyberCorp and a product called 'CyberDesk' which gives users a single windows interface to multiple e-
mail and public information systems and has a seamless hook to third-
party encryption programs of the users choice.  Unfortunately, the article failed to include any contact info.  Does anyone know how I can contact Nan Atwell or CyberCorp?  An email address would be ideal but a vox phone number, a USnail address, or even a (Yuck!) fax number would be sincerely appreciated.  Please respond via private email (Don_Henson if you can help me.
