cars are claimed to "safe". That only applies is driven sober, within speed
restrictions and road conditions by a (basically) trained driver.
The same analogy applies, in my view.

@_subject: Timing RSA and Certificates worth ?? 
Earlier, I said :
timing attacks on the RSA private signing key.
I meant that on-line certificate issuing, notary and similar services where
data is submitted to a system for processing/RSA encryption are subject to
this for of attack.
Parts of the SEPP/STT protocols appear to require this of merchants and
I retract my comments about ecash/echeques - I'm not sure of the
implications there yet.
As for SEPP/STT - another nail in the coffin, me thinks.

My limited mind induces me to think that a certificate become subject to
timing attacks on the RSA private signing key.
This appears to meet the main critieria of fixed data (for instance, a
bank's certificate in/on ecash), processed widely by a small group of
machines (eg a subset of customers) on inherently untrusted machines (home
PC's) which may or may not have the right software/operating system parts.
Certificates in general, do not appear to lend themselves to "blinding".
In this case, certificate verification  processes seem flawed and highly
eg a merchant gets lots of data containing a bank(s) certificate, and
probably encrypted data. Is this the death knell for STT/SEPP and ecash/echeque systems ???
Some ramblings and thoughts.
