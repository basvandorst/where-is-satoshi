Just for a reality check, Georg Wilhelm Hegel (1770-1831), was not an ass,   but rather a brilliant philospher, even if you do like his views. I am   guessing you are refering to his "dialectic", which was simply an observation   of the way history worked:  Thesis <---> Antithesis
                                   Synthesis
   The synthesis then becomes the new thesis and history moves. It was not
   proposed as a method of social change, but rather a description of how
   history moves. It is always better to some of idea of what you are talking
   about before you make such rash, critical statements.    Sorry for the noise to the list.

The Boston Sunday Globe Business section has an article by Jon Auerbach
entitled Cypherpunks with a picture of Carl Ellison and one of Ian Goldberg
and David Wagner. It stresses privacy, anarchy and the fears of the FBI.

Roy M. Silvernail wriote:
  The US is merely trying to catch up to what the Europeans have been doing
for over a decade. In fact, the US still has a way to go. You ought to pass
through Heathrow in London some time to see what real airport security looks
like. The US security changes are a recent response, starting after the
World Trade Center bombing and being stepped up on a continuing basis.
Today you need a picture ID to board with your ticket. Tomorrow...? We have
lived in relative safety compared to the rest of the world, but I think those
days are over. Usual disclaimer.  Bob Bruen.

Without actually agreeing with the FAA, the reason you can't have a name
   other than your own on your ticket, as well as why you are required to
   be in your assigned seat on take-off and landing is because if there is    a plane crash, they need to be able to identify an otherwise difficult
   to identify body. This does have some relevance to airport security if
   a plane is blown up.
                                 Sorry about this,

Subj:	Re: DISCUSSION FOR IETF DALLAS
THE WWW MUST BE CONSUMER FRIENDLY IF IT IS TO SURVIVE.
THE AVERAGE CONSUMER THRU A PC, OR A "DEDICATED WEB TERMINAL ON TOP OF THEIR
TV SET", MUST BE ABLE TO USE THE WEB IN THE FUTURE TO:
          1. SEARCH FOR CONSUMER GOODS; ORDER CONSUMER GOODS.
          2. USE THE WEB FOR TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS AND E-MAIL
          3. DOWNLOAD TIME SHIFT AUDIO & VIDEO
          4. DOWLOAD MOVIES, SOFTWARE, AND P.P.V. EVENTS
          5. HOOK ON-LINE TO VIDEO & AUDIO THE WWW AND THE ON-LINE SERVICES MUST BE ABLE TO DIAL OUT TO THE CONSUMER
OUR BIGGEST FUTURE PROBLEM IS THAT WE CAN NOT LET BILL GATES, NOR THE
TELEPHONE COMPANIES, NOR THE CABLE TV COMPANIES, NOR THE MADISON AVENUE
ADVERTISING AGENCIES GET CONTROL OF THE WWW.
OUR CURRENT PROBLEM IS THAT THE AVERAGE CONSUMER CAN NOT COMPLETE AN ACCURATE
SEARCH ON THE WEB.
COMPANIES MUST BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS, AND TO
EMBED EVERY POSSIBLE KEYWORD IN THEIR SITE SO THAT IN THE FUTURE A CONSUMER
COULD ENTER AT THE SEARCH LINE:
        "SHOW ALL DEALERS IN BALTIMORE THAT SELL CHRYSLER MINI-VANS"
AND AN ACCURATE SEACH OF THE WEB WILL BE RETURNED.
AT THIS POINT SO MANY CYBERPUNKS HAVE EMBEDDED SO MUCH GARBAGE ON THE WEB,
THAT YOU CAN NOT COMPLETE AN ACCURATE SEARCH.
OUR COMPANY HAS BEEN ASKED BY THE NEW YORK AUTO SHOW TO CREATE THE MOST
HIGHTECH VIRTUAL REALITY MOTION SIMULATOR THEATRE FOR THE 1996 NEW YORK AUTO
SHOW. DURING OUR RESEARCH, WE ENTERED "NEW YORK AUTO SHOW" IN OUR WEB CRAWLER
(AMERICA ON-LINE). YOU COULD NOT BELIEVE ALL OF THE GARBAGE THAT WAS RETURNED
FROM OUR SEARCH.
ADDITIONALLY FOR EXAMPLE, IF ON AMERICA ON-LINE YOU NEED TO SEND AN E-MAIL TO
DONALD TRUMP OR TO AOL'S STEVE CASE, WHEN YOU SEARCH THE AOL MEMBER DATABASE,
WHO IS THE REAL DONALD TRUMP OR THE REAL STEVE CASE.
IN SUMMARY, WHAT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED AT  IETF IN DALLAS NEXT WEEK IS A
STANDARD THAT PROTECTS TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS, AND ALSO A POLICING
AGENCY THAT WILL DETERMINE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS AT DONALD TRUMP CHRYSLER IS
AT CHRYSLERY@ BILL GATES IS AT BILL GATES ETC.
BUT MORE IMPORTANT, WE NEED TO CLEANUP THE TRASH THAT THE CYBER-PUNKS ARE
PLACING ON THE WEB.

CAMBRIDGE, MA, December 12, 1995  --  The Open Software
Foundation (OSF) today announced the DCE-Web Advanced
Technology Offering (ATO).  The goal of this software
project is to provide all of the essential capabilities
of the distributed computing environment (encryption,
                                           ^^^^^^^^^
* Secure Local Proxy - provides secure DCE-Web access
  using standard off-the-shelf browsers. It is possible
  to access DCE-Web using any browser without any
  modification. The Secure Local Proxy functions as
  protocol switch, forwarding proxy requests either as
  standard http or using the secure DCE-Web protocol.
* Secure Gateway - integrates the DCE-Web with other
  secure Web protocols. The Gateway provides secure
  access to the Multi-protocol Server, providing DCE
  authentication based on public key identities. The
  gateway is designed to allow plug-in access for
  multiple public key Web protocols.

@_subject: another fbi prosecution 
The Chronicle of Higher Education (Dec 8, 1995) page A21 reports that
 Monmouth University (West Long Branch, New Jersey;   sophomore Dominick LaScala was charged last week in federal court with two  counts of computer fraud.
 Dominick had his campus account taken away after other users complained
 that he had been "advertising business proposals inappropriately on line."
 The FBI alleges that he then sent 24,000 email messages in one day from a
 commercial account (unamed) to Monmouth's system.. This denial of service  attack was successful for about 5 hours. He is facing six(6) years in prison  and a up to $350,000 in fines (1.20 years/hr and and $70,000/hr).  His lawyer (Kenneth Weiner) claims that "even if his client sent the mail  bomb" since no damage was done to the system, he could not be convicted  under the computer fraud statute. He also claims that prosecutors are trying  to make an example of his client. The university is still trying to figure  out whether he can be punished under the university code of conduct.

While thought control is difficult, one cannot ignore the damage done
  trying to do it. All of the above examples were expensive in terms of
  human suffering and death toll for long periods of time. The controls
  were effective for some time with long periods for recovery. The facists
  may lose in the end but the price of victory is very high. I fear the
  current and future efforts at controls will be costly no matter what
  the outcome.
