Greets, kiddies!  Quick question.  Has anything constructive come
out of nobody in the past month?  I've just signed on
with this mailing list, and all I ever read from that anon addy is
a flame regarding one person or another.
Personally, unless at least a couple folks using replay.com have
pitched in usefull information in the past while, I'm irate enough
to open up my .kill file.
Thanks for your help,
The Sheriff.

Very interesting.  That hasen't hit my area, as far as I know.
In addition, paging from a pay phpne (at least, where I'm located)
is of no use unless you're using a telephone number to alert the
owner of the pager to your location (which makes it easier to find
my friends, granted), since pay phones have been re-hardwired to
reject incoming calls.

If you would be so kind as to a) specify that supreme court ruling,
and b) identify an online resource where I can obtain the text of
that decision, so that I can 1) confirm or deny your allegation, and
2) debate your position intelligently, I would greatly appreciate it.
What if I run a business out of my house?  What if I don't need
employees (such that I could affort to hire a couple of people,
or nobody at all)?  If I hire someone who is white because I don't
want to hire someone is black, then it is not a loss that is felt
within the black community, since I don't *need* to hire anybody
in the first place.
The above phrase is something that I hear a lot, and it deeply
disturbs me.  Regulation is allways seen as the arm of fairness,
when the above phrase is mentioned.
I am not allowed to choose to hire someone based on skin color,
and yet the country is riddled by "affirmative" action programs --
which, in the short and brutal version of the description of "AA"
is just a system of RACE-BASED PREFRENCES.
I find it very interesting that liberal activists in California,
who rabidly insist that racism is wrong, that we must have racial
dialogues, that we should all "just get allong," used the court
system to fight Proposition 209, which ends affirmative action in
that state.  The people voted their will, and the activists took
to the courts to override the people's will -- in effect, saying
that the California voting public is just a bunch of idiots.
I don't like someone telling me that I don't know better.  When
I like is as little government influence in my life as humanly
possible, be it in my choice of breakfast cereal, or employees.
I read Article I, Section 8.  I shall quote the relevent portion that
relate to this discussion:
   "To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several
   states, and with the Indian tribes; ... "
Now, then.  Notice the eighth word -- "amung."  As I understand
it, this means that the Fed can regulate INTERstate commerce, not
INTRAstate commerce.  This is why (again, as I understand it) the
Fed will inspect meat crossing state lines, but not meat that is
moved around within a state.  It is for this reason that not all
meat is inspected by the Fed.  If anybody has refrences to texts
that prove me wrong, bring them forward so that I can refine my
argument. :)
So, back to my home business.  Let's say I build computers and sell
them around the state.  Since I'm not transporting my product from
one state to another, the Fed can't constitutionally regulate how
I do business.
This is ALLWAYS the case.  You earn freedom through being a
responsible adult.  When you don't infringe on the rights of
others, the government has no grounds under which to infringe
on yours (through punishment or direct order).
No, no, no.  To obligate "decency" at gunpoint is definitely
NOT anything but facicism (sp?).  I remember a time when people
were obligated to do the "decent" thing and worship God and
Jesus Christ -- and, as the bumper sticker says, "The last time
religion and politics were mixed, someone got burned."
Decency is a very fuzzy word.  After all, the KKK says that
white people are the only decent people.  The KKK is in the
minority.  To use your own words:
"No majority group has a right to discriminate against a minority."
By your own words, the KKK should be allowed to discriminate
against blacks when they hire if they want to, since they are
in the minority when compared (by numbers) to all of the groups
they think are lesser than those of white skin.
After all -- does skin color constitute the only minority?  Not
according to the definition of the word.

Okay, I'll avoid that since I have never read a scrap of
corporational law.
Just out fo curiosity -- if I were to take my taxes out like I
were operating a business out of my house without declaring I am
as such, and then not take the "excess" tax money back as a return,
would the Fed have any grounds for suit of fraud, since I had paid
all the taxes of a business properly?
What I'm wondering is if the fraud charge would be because I haden't
paid the proper taxes or not.
I haven't seen or read the book.  However, it would seem to me that
equal opertunity and equal outcome aren't one and the same.  While
you are making it possible for folks who wouldn't normally hit the
middle income road to do so, you are then also restraining the
brighter bulbs from taking off like NASA rockets (and the analogy is
correct, since being a genius doesn't guarantee success).

I've got a question for y'all.
Some idiot finally sent me a junk e-mail message that
I couldn't do anything about with what I have the knowledge to do -- reading the headers turned up only
one ISP, which was apparently owned by the spammer.
I'm hoping you guys would know where I could find out
more about this individual -- I'm hoping that he does
in fact buy his service from someone else, and if so,
I'm not sure how to find that out.  If he doesn't, is
there anything I can do?

Look, I realize I was probably asking a stupid question, but
you don't have to be quick with me.  I figured that there were
some things that I could do that I simply didn't know about,
beyond the simplicity of returning the spam the postmaster, root,
and abuse account of the last ISP the spam was routed through.
My interest isn't simply in getting rid of the spam.  "Empty
Trash" is a pretty simple concept on Eudora.  What I want to do
is fight the flow -- and while there may be as many as 10 spammers
per ISP out there, every spam I do something about is one less
server that accepts messages for routing that don't come from one
of their accounts.
If that doesn't make sense to you, don't bother answering the
e-mail next time, eh?

Firstly, something being long-established doesn't make it right.
SO, let's look at it this way, regarding the freedom of association.
You have the freedom to associate with whom you choose, don't you
think?  It's not in the constitution, but you would throw a fit if
Uncle Sam told you that it was illegal for you to go play baseball
with little Billy if little Billy was black and you were white.
AND, in my not so humble opinion, If you have the freedom to play
with little Billy, then you have the freedom to tell little Billy
to go fuck himself because you refuse to play with "niggers."
Sam Adams (as it may or may not have been mentioned on this list)
himself had a problem with our constitution -- he didn't think that
it was right for the people to ratify the bill of rights, thereby
protecting certain rights under the constitution.  Why?  Simple.
He was of the mind that setting our rights, such as the right to
free speech, in concrete meant that anything NOT set in concrete
wasn't a right -- he felt that by ratifying the bill of rights,
rather than using logic as I did above, we were actually LIMITING
our rights as freely roaming human beings.
Sadly, America has become less of a home to the free and the brave,
and more of a home to the pissed and the laywers.  I remember an
experience where I was lounging in a booth at a Perkins with a few
friends of mine.  Two of them were sitting on one side (they were
dating at the time), and I was stretched across the cushion on the
other side.
The manager came up to me and told me to sit up straight, or he
would ask me to leave.  I lit a cigarette and told him to go fuck
himself.  He asked me to leave.  I did so, my friends in tow, and
we refused to pay the $40 bill on our way out.
America should be about not taking any shit from anybody -- not
because you can sue, but because you have enough attitude to realize
when the other guy's being an idiot, and because you have enough
balls to tell him so.

I do see the validity of your argument, and I do agree
about forcing everybody to have a "True Name" to not
necessarily be a good thing.  Then again, a few years
ago the marketing industry (if it may be called that)
had no idea the "wealth" they could produce by using the
Internet for relatively cheap advertising.
I love Eudora for a very simple reason: the simplicity
of the filters offered in even the free version.  While
the simplicity also bars complex filters that take care
of a bunch of e-mail in one pop, it does allow for layering.
I have various levels in my filtering system: content-
based, like filtering for PGP messages, stupid crap
from Vulis or threads I don't feel like following.  Next
comes the To: filters -- I've got a number of different
e-mail boxes, each with its own purpose.  If I get mail
auto-forwarded from any of my secondary accounts, it falls
through these filters and is dropped into the correct
folders.  After that come the sender-based filters.  If
there is mail for me from an anonymous source that is not
addressed to me, and doesn't contain content that interests
me, it's dropped into the trash.  Then all the mail from
persistant spam domains that I allready know about gets
thrown in the trash.   If any mail comes FROM a mailing
list, instead of being sent TO a mailing list, it's the
next to go.  After all that, I filter the To: line for all
my mailing lists, and each bit of mail is sent into the
correct folder as above.
After all that rot, if the mail in question doesn't contain
my address in the To: or Cc: lines (except recipient list
repressed mail, which is sometimes interesting), it too is
dropped into my *SPAM folder and the subject is changed
accordingly, which then wraps up 99% of all the spam that I
receive, and I forward the headers to the appropriate ISPs.
There is a "simple" solution to this, and it isn't government
legislation.  If spammers want to be smart about it and
AVOID legislation by power-hungry politicians, all they
have to do is subscribe to spam ISPs that are set up for the
express purpose of spamming.  It doesn't matter how many of
them are out there, really, or what mailing lists are abused:
those who are receptive to spam will respond, and those of
us who hate spam can set up blacklists that detail all the
spam ISPs that we encounter, and circulate those lists.  It
then becomes insanely easy to receive no more than ONE message
from each spam ISP (they could create a new domain tag, .spm),
and everybody's happy.
If the spammers would be smart enough to put the effort into
creating such a network, much as we have, for discussing
issues that matter to us, then they would be in a lot less
trouble, and fewer people would be calling for their heads.
Or am I wrong? :)

With the people of this country.  There that was simple. :)
Okay, my point was simply that an assumed right shouldn't
HAVE to be implied under the existing constitution.  Either
we have to find a way to list all our freedoms at once and
then guarantee them definitively, or we have to not guarantee
them on paper, so as to not LIMIT them TO paper.
I'm assuming that the bill of rights was written in this
spirit -- our forefathers listed and guaranteed all of our
rights that had been previously contested by King George.
I can only assume that they had no idea the kind of civil
war they would start over rights that they didn't see as
being threatened but must (in today's world) be guaranteed
by law in order to be valid.
I mean, hell how to you spell out the right to privacy in
leagalese, in one paragraph?  You can't, not in today's
society.  Everybody's definition has a different spin, and
all of the ones based on common sense are correct.
Nine judges, appointed for life, who therefore never run
for election (even though they are selected and confirmed
by elected officials).  Whomever chooses them influences the
political philosophy driving that court for years and years
after their term of office has expired.  I entirely agree with
Thomas Jefferson.  Interestingly enough, the constitution
doesn't say a damn thing about "judicial review."  It was
a power that the supreme court granted unto itself, something
that the court itself would challange if either of the other
two branches of government tried that...
Personally, I think the voters should decide exactly what
the supreme court can do (since it's rather vaguely defined
in the constitution), and then give themselves to vote on
who will be put in those nine chairs.
I think the idea behind it all was to say that, in putting
nine judges in the highest court and giving them lifetime
terms, they then have the ability to make decisions without
facing the wrath of the other two brances.  You're correct,
however.  A man who represents himself in a court of law
has a fool for a client, and this holds true for the Fed.
Thank you, thank you! :)
I didn't know that.
Actually, I think the "unless we say so" clause is allready
in there, in most if not all ammendments (unless I'm
mistaken).  It reads something to the effect of Congress
having the athority to draft any and all laws that assist in
the upholding of whatever part of the constitution that the
clause is included in.  I think it's called the "elastic
clause," if memory serves me correctly (where's my copy of
the constitution that has all the $2 bills with the signing
of the declaration of independance on the back stuffed into
the middle?!).
I think what happened was that the prohibition ammendent was
drafted in the "do MORE good!" days following the United State's
successes in the first world war.  A time of "good feelings"
was in effect, and since the evil Germans had been stamped out,
folks figured that stamping out other evils was also a good thing.
How ironic that the repealing ammendment immediately followed
the woman's sufferage ammendment.  It's like the country woke
up from a bad hangover...
Allways do. :)

I've allways found myself in a rather precarious
position, when it comes to identifiable my car is.
When I frequent a location (coffee house, restaurant)
more than once, people suddenly recognize me because
of the artwork on my car -- a mural of an oriental
dragon painted on the driver's side, and a blue-n-
black phoenix-in-progress on the passanger side.
Obviously, this makes it easy for law enforcement
officers to identify me after clocking me.  I remem-
ber my first (and last, as far as I'M concerned)
police chase, when I was trying to catch up with a
pal who I had to meet, who I spotted heading south
while I was heading north on a particular superhighway.
A cop flew past going north after I turned around,
screamed through the midway, and flipped on his
lights.  I escaped, amazingly.
I don't want to paint my car camo, because even
though the murals were free (a la my adopted little
brother), they took time and hold sentimental value
(not to mention the fact that they turn a borning
commuter hotrod into something I don't have to use
the license plate to identify in a parking lot).  Is
there any other way to circumvent visual aquisition
and identification of my vechicle?
Besides a Klingon cloaking device, of course.
