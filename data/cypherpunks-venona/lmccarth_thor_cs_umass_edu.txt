@_subject: Re: Breaking into girlfriend's files 
My sentiments exactly. Whether or not she's two-timing, I imagine she'd be
pretty upset (and justifiably so) if she knew her boyfriend wants to break
into her private documents. He should *ask* her straight out to confirm or
deny his suspicions. If he doesn't like the answer, he should get out.
Someone needs to give her PGP ASAP, IMHO....

This sounds to me rather like saying:
"If the American public gets burned by accepting Skipjack as the crypto standard, perhaps they'll take the time to learn about real encryption."
I prefer the version where the American public doesn't get burned in the first
place. If Clipper has to be adopted before the public will learn about real
encryption, why are we bothering to try to promote it now ?  Shouldn't we be
backing Clipper wholeheartedly, to teach 'em a lesson ?
I have ideals, yes. My deepest condolences if you don't have any.

As Eric notes elsewhere, off-site backups are useful in general in case some
physical calamity strikes your site. It seems to me that a data haven addresses a more aggressive threat model than this. Rather than just worrying
about the act of a hacker / nature / etc. eradicating our local copies of
data (encrypted or not), we're concerned about intelligent agents (human or
electronic) attempting to commit genocide on all instances of some data we
possess. Scenario: June is a test engineer at Rockwell Intl. At the lab where she works,
it is observed that some rubber O-rings being designed for the space shuttle
are liable to crack, and lose their airtight seal, when exposed to the extremely low temperatures of space. The project is behind, so the researchers
are instructed to proceed in spite of the problem. June encrypts the test
results and deposits them in a data haven. Then she calls her boss's boss and
offers a deal (whitemail ?). Either the part is redesigned, or she'll present
the incriminating evidence to the New York Times. Even if Rockwell sends some
goons to June's apartment while she's at work the next day, to reduce her laptop to solder, she still has the means to carry out her threat.

Uh, I think you probably mean Lance Cottrell, not Hal -- unless Hal's also
written a similar utility with an identical name, about which I haven't heard.
Alex de Joode posted a copy of the usura key edited to reflect the domain name
change to alt.privacy.anon-server. It's presumably on the keyservers....
Oh, and the flame remailer passed away with the closure of the jpunix remailer,
as far as I can tell. (I vaguely recall something to the effect that sinet.org
is/was registered as a subdomain of jpunix.com, but I might well be wrong.)
Hope this helps.

Lest we suffer a recurrence of the C'punks Logo thread, which generated a
whole raft of list traffic which would have been better kept private, please
reply directly to Joshua and not to the whole list. [He seems to imply that
he wants private replies ("testing procmail") anyway, but I want to encourage this practice explicitly.]

Not exclusively, though -- I've been seeing sporadic stuff from mnemosyne for

@_subject: Re: An idea about Java and remailer clients and servers... 
Indeed, that's the way the C version works now:
[from README.client in the Mixmaster distribution]:
# Mixmaster uses the same source & binary for the remailer program and the
# client program. Setting up a client, however, is significantly easier.
It would be interesting to see how the market would react to this. There
might be quite a bit of reluctance to take on the liability of a remailer
operator just to send an anonymous message (maybe that's a good thing ;)
Some mechanism would need to be worked out to tie delivery of each message
to satisfactory performance of its true originating address, without making
it much easier for an opponent to tie a message to its point of origin.

@_subject: MOSS and Mixmaster: A Media Type Proposal 
I've spent some time reading these proposed standards, along with parts of
RFCs 1423 and 1590, with an eye to applying them to remailers. I'd like to
get a sanity check and comments before I consider proceeding with submission
to the IETF Media Types review list, etc.
I propose a new Media Type subtype for Mixmaster remailer packets,
"application/mixmaster". (For the purposes of this message, "Mixmaster
remailer packet" refers to a packet generated by a Mixmaster server or client,
and intended for transmission to a Mixmaster server. It does *not* cover
messages generated by a Mixmaster server that are intended for an ultimate
message recipient.) This is intended to be an experimental protocol
for use in the control part of a multipart/encrypted message. There is one required parameter, "version", meant to indicate the version
number of the originating Mixmaster software.  In addition, one optional
parameter, "key-id", may be included. If present, this parameter would
indicate the single line key prefix/ID of the public Mix key used to
encrypt (at the outermost layer) the contents of the application/mixmaster
part. This might be used to thoroughly disambiguate decryption options in
the event that the recipient server has more than one currently active
public Mix keys.
The application/mixmaster (control) part of the multipart/encrypted message would contain the padded list of Mixmaster server hop headers, superencrypted at the outermost layer with a public Mix key (presumably, one belonging to the
recipient server). A single decryption of these headers should reveal the
IDEA key used to superencrypt, at the outermost layer, the body part of the
multipart/encrypted message. The application/octet-stream (body) part of the
multipart/encrypted message would contain the list of ultimate recipients of
the remailed message, the text of the message itself, and any additional processing instructions to the final Mix server. The latter, body part of
the multipart/encrypted message shall have been encrypted by the originator
using the IDEA key specified in the former, control part.
The contents of the application/mixmaster part should be encoded in
accordance with the standards for application/octet-stream.
(NB: this amounts to a division of the extant Mixmaster packet format roughly into a control section and a body ("payload") section.)

The sender can ask the client to set the number of hops as low as 1, if she/it/he so desires.
I think Doug Barnes has suggested the best protocol for handling "co-op
remailing" ;)
