CALL FOR ANECDOTES
I need your help. I'm a writer. My work has appeared in Playboy, Esquire,
Rolling Stone, Best American Short Stories. You can examine my credentials
at I am currently researching the following article for American Reporter:
The End of Privacy
When the chief operating officer of a major telephone company can't keep his
unlisted telephone number secret, you know the battle for personal privacy
is pretty much lost. New York magazine found the address of reclusive
novelist Thomas Pynchon through an on-line credit-card checking service in
two minutes. Encrypting messages attracts attention and no secret remains
secret very long when hackers with the skills of con men trick the
unsuspecting into revealing passwords. So what would a world without privacy
be like? Maybe it's not all 1984 -- honesty could be another by-product.
I wonder if anyone might want to share:
[1] Any unusually biting anecdotes that would fit the theme above?
[2] Other sources of similar information?
[3] Quotable opinions?
I'm basically interested in personal opinions and experiences. Example: I
received a reply from a writer who had been the subject of a searching
expose and came out of it feeling liberated of her secrets.
I think that as a practical matter privacy no longer exists, if it ever did.
I think it's an illusion created by industrialism. Only hermits had privacy
in the past. As we pass into the next phase of social evolution, I believe
that our constructs will resemble animism -- that is they will be living or
life-like, soft rather than hard, transparent rather than opaque.
Today, the cost of maintaining secrets is beginning to outweigh the value.
Yet we're still addicted to this illusion. What would a genuinely
transparent world be like to those used to living behind masks?
I'm also interested in comments on the following:
[4] Electronic surveillance In last November's PC Computing, John Dvorak claimed that government
intelligence agencies had set up remail services in order to check on people
using them. In a private letter I received, a very sane but prudent
journalist working for a mainstream newspaper cited fears of e-mail being
read by intelligence agencies as a reason for not telling me something he
had on his mind.
Questions: What do we know about this sort of thing? What do are we doing
about it?
[5] Spying in the newsroom
Earlier this year, The Miami Herald's Jim Hampton came out strongly against
the CIA using reporters as spies in foreign country. What about in the
United States? I have received information on more than one occasion about
journalists on the payroll of intelligence and/or police agencies spying on
their colleagues, as well as making trouble for specific targets, and
helping squelch certain themes, among other activities.
Question: Do publications tolerate this? Cooperate fully? If not, how do
they handle these cases when they become aware of them?
[6] Blacklisting
The existence of black lists was very well documented in the wake of the
McCarthy era. I'm sure we have good reason to believe that they still exist.
Questions: Do electronic editorial black lists exist? Other fields? How do
they work? How does a victim get off a black list?
All replies will be fully attributed and I will send a checking copy of the
final draft to anyone whose anecdote I use.
Many thanks for your interest and cooperation.

     I am currently working on a thesis paper concerned with the subject of
information warfare as it relates to the media.  Specifically, my research
question is:
"Is it morally and ethically acceptable for military commanders and staff
members to purposely mislead the media for the purpose of tactical deception
and information warfare against one's enemies?"
I will obviously be taking a look at both sides of this issue and would
appreciate any information you may have on the subject.

Dear Betty,
Thanks in part to the input you provided and the quotes obtained through
your resources, I was able to produce a feature on Cyber Warfare that will appear in the February issue of ARMED FORCES JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL, and perhaps other publications around the world.
I am now working on a story which takes a look at the FUTURISTIC
BATTLEFIELD and seek experts for quotes, insight, products, etc. Such things as robotic soldiers and unmanned aircraft will be discussed, as well as warfare controlled from romote sites.
Any help, leads, manufacturers, etc., that you could provide would be
Best regards & Happy New Year.

Over two days, the three tracks and plenary sessions will focus on:
1. Military, Intelligence, Nation-States and Government Contractors. What are their special needs and concerns. Leaders from all areas will bring you current with their
2. Cyberterrorism and Crime: Law Enforcement, Domestic, National and International. Case histories and experience from those who know will provide the foundation for solutions and cooperation to a spreading problem.
3. The Private Sector and Commercial Infrastructure: Leading experts on information assurance will provide new models for security, management and infrastructure
Optional Pre-Conference Tutorials (May 7)
Three Pre-Conference tutorials will be offered to get the non-technical manager, law enforcement or government representative 'up to speed' on InfoWar:
A full day of extraordinary information and materials.
B. Information Security Basics. Dr. Mich Kabay, NCSA's Dir. of Education will take the non-technical manager on a three and one half hour tour of the fundamentals of information security. Essential knowledge for anyone involved with information warfare, cyberterrorism or defending against them.
