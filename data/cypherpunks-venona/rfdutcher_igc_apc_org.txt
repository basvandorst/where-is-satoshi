Reply-to:      gao-docs                        GAO Report - Information Superhighway
The U.S. General Accounting Office, the Congressional watchdog
agency, has recently released the following report:
  *** ASCII Full Text Access and Ordering Info Follows ***
TITLE:    Information Superhighway: An Overview of Technology Challenges
          RPTNO: AIMD-95-23                  DOCUMENT DATE: 01/23/95
    GAO reviewed the technical issues associated with protecting the
    information superhighway from unauthorized access.
    GAO found that: (1) the information superhighway poses technical challenges
    concerning the security, privacy, and reliability of personal and
    proprietary information; (2) a large proportion of the information that
    will traverse the superhighway will be sensitive and a tempting target for
    hackers, foreign governments conducting political and military intelligence
    operations, domestic and foreign enterprises engaged in industrial
    espionage, or terrorist groups seeking to disrupt society or the economy;
    (3) significant effort will be needed to define, develop, test, and
    implement measures to prevent unauthorized access to the superhighway; (4)
    although the federal government could play a leading role in ensuring the
    superhighway's security, critics argue that individuals should be free to
    choose the technical means for meeting their security requirements; (5) a
    major challenge facing the development of the information superhighway will
    be creating a consensus between the federal government, computer and
    communications industry, business community, and civil liberties groups on
    how to ensure information security and privacy; (6) federal and private
    sectors have begun establishing uniform standards to ensure the
    superhighway's interoperability; and (7) questions remain about how to
    protect the superhighway from large network failures and encourage the
    telecommunications industry to develop a secure and reliable
    infrastructure.
This report is available both in print and electronically.

Gee, fellas, looking over this bill, *most* of what's going on is
just porting existing telephone law over to cybercomm. Given the
existence of 900-sex-talk, the phone companies are clearly not being
held responsible for content.
They are required, of course, to cooperate when complaints of harassing or obscene calls are made, to obey properly warranted requests for wiretaps, etc.  It's perfectly reasonable to expect similar requirements on net service providers.
Yeah, but First Amendment and common carrier law is a morass of conflicting statutes, interpretations, and case law.  After all, libel law puts some content liability on newspapers [too much, IMHO, but it has hardly destroyed freedom of the press].
As several posters have noted, the placement of the key words "knowingly" and "intentionally" are critical.  It doesn't appear, though, that any "knowingly"s or "intentionally"s have been removed.  I am forwarding copies of this and the whole bill text to my brother, the former DA in Telluride, to see if he sees any unusual craptraps.  I'll post any useful reply ...
I.e., *just like with phones,* you can't send harrassing or obscene messages to unwilling recipients.  Is there a lot of slack for bullshit?  You betcha!  A major change from the present?  Doesn't look like it.  [no intention of holding up the present as paradise, of course  ;-]

They *do* have to prove intent -- as to how, that's what juries are for.  BTW, he used her real name in the post, with no disclaimers about fiction.  From what I have heard, if he had said the same thing in her presence, he could have been arrested for assault.
So is saying something that would be actionable in a public space
also actionable in a public cyberspace?  I dunno, and neither does
anyone else.  But it's a well-established principle that a threat is a shout of "Fire!" in a crowded theater.
The "Law" is very conservative.  Not like Newt the Grinch, but like the Catholic Church -- make the least change necessary to accomodate the pressures.  If you've got laws to cover telephones and cybercomm looks like telephones, get out the shoehorn.
"Free" speech has always been a balancing act.  The founders
certainly didn't intend to provide "free" speech for blacks and
women.  Our current case law structure is, in large part, the results
of the ACLU's 80-year struggle to prevent a repetition of the
wholesale imprisonment of dissidents during WWI.  Previously, people
were *commonly* tossed in local hoosegows [sp?] at the whim of the
local authorities for speaking out on anything [Quakers, Methodists,
Baptists, temperance, free love, abolition, suffrage, pacifists, Romanists, Masons, anti-masons, anarchists, populists, free silver, etc. ad nauseum].
"They" have never liked "free" speech ... :-(

Well, I was quoting a small AP story in a paper notorious for
clipping articles short, so I knew that some [if not many]
circumstances would be missing.  In conversations today at
Potlatch 4 I learned of other circumstances, albeit not
necessarily what I would call "extenuating" ones.  And the
lawyers, of course, will be spin controlling from now until a
Not necessarily -- there's lots of case law that the threatened
person need not be present to be threatened.  The people present
are still witnesses.  I agree there's a difference, but its nature
isn't obvious.  Precisely what that difference is is up to judges,
juries and [goddess help us!] legislators.
Irony noted and appreciated -- but it does illustrate the "public" nature of the forum.
I was in high school while the Supremes [the real Supremes, with Earl Warren, not the bogus nostalgia group currently wearing the black robes] were doing the decisions that allowed Joyce and Lawrence to be sold in bookstores, and I was taught Shakespeare from a bowlderized edition of Romeo & Juliet.  Trust me, we aren't in a place remotely like that now [not that there aren't plenty of people trying to get back there].
Which is not to say I'm complacent -- when I have money to spare from Green work, it goes to the ACLU.  Eternal vigilance and all that.  And this dude is entitled to presumption of innocence, a jury trial, and all the other paraphenalia of procedural liberty.
However, given the information available to date, I see no reason to believe that he's been busted for writing "erotic fiction"  rather than threatening a woman.  Violence against women is too real, and in other contexts courts have held to a standard of what a "reasonable woman" might fear.
BTW, does alt.sex.stories presume fiction, or is it pretend truth like the readers' sex stories in Penthouse?

Toleration of divergent views is not one of those issues that breaks out well along left-right polarities.  E.g., Andrea Dworkin's closest aliies on porn are on the xtian right, not among her fellow radical feminists [contrary to the image promoted in some mass media].  Threats to Catcher in the Rye in libraries are far more common than incidents like the one in Menlo Park.
Legally, that's a question yet to be resolved.
In any case, this is hardly cyrpto-related.  I would far rather lurk as the mathematicians discuss factoring.  I learn more [even if I only get one word in three :-]

One of the problems commenting on long thoughtful posts is the number of hooks, and limiting oneself to just a few.
Well, I certainly hope so.  But let's remember Poland in 1979, where "they" were desperate enough to shut down the entire phone system.  It gained them only an extra 10 years of control, but it cost the Poles a *lot* of misery.
But "samizdat" raises an interesting economic issue around security.  The Soviets paid just enough attention to the circulation of hand-written or typed copies to make sure people spent a lot of time and energy at it -- time and energy not spent on more obviously dangerous activity.   Compare the volume of Solzenhitsen's output before and after exile [let's not debate quality].  That didn't mean samizdat wasn't subversive and long-term dangerous -- but it was very expensive and absorbing to dissidents and potential dissidents.
But that's the situation cypherpunks [and friends :] want to put our hypothetical eavesdroppers [government or corporate] in.  Not exactly harmless, but spending a lot of time and energy being concerned with the chasing multiple carbon copies of samizdat novellas.
I find that techno-illiterate Greens have very little trouble understanding FIDONet -- it's the kind of small-scale organizing within larger networks that a lot of progressive activity has always followed.  They find it very hard to believe that other kinds of techie nets are really secure in the long run.  It is, in fact, the level of activity that the Poles reverted to without the phone system ...
Geez, I have enough trouble getting card-carrying Greens to use and/or develop good ecological metaphors without some crypto-anarcho-libber punk muscling into the territory!  ;-)
