Black Unicorn Chill... I thought that our prime objective was to defeat Clipper...
even if you don't like Ross, he does have some pull with the people of
this country, and that's what we need... we need the *PEOPLE* to fight
Clipper.  We need the fight not to just be "a group of civil libertarians", but
the general populous.  Maybe Ross isn't the answer, but at least I've
taken a real step to try to oppose Clipper.  What the hell have you
done, Black Unicorn?
