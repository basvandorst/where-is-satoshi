I didn't have the listserve info in England, and somehow lost the request before I got back.

Sallie Mae's commercial paper is NOT backed by the full faith and credit of the US government.  They carry a specific disclaimer to that effect.  It is true that many personal student loans (GSLs) from banks are guaranteed by the government.  The system was recently reformed to remove the riskless subsidy to Sallie Mae, which is 100% privately owned, and very profitable.
Similarly Fannie Mae and all other priavetly held GSE's are only backed by an "implicit" federal guarantee.  Although the only time one of these got into trouble the feds did bail it out.
See my forthcoming article "Reinventing Government Corporations" in the Illinois Law Review.  Due out in about three months.

The Fifth Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy
Sponsored by:          * ACM SIGCOMM, SIGCAS, SIGSAC, and
                       * Stanford Law School
28 - 31 March 1995
San Francisco Airport Marriott Hotel
Burlingame, California
CONNECT WITH OTHERS WHO ARE DETERMINING HOW COMPUTERS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
WILL AFFECT YOUR FREEDOM AND PRIVACY... JOIN US AT CFP'95.
We have reached the crossroads of the Information Age.
No longer is the electronic frontier inhabited solely by a small band of technical pioneers sharing a common code of conduct. Computer and telecommunications technologies have become part of mainstream living, conversation, and politics. These changes compel us to reexamine the definition of our rights and the processes by which those rights are being defined. The Fifth Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy will assemble experts,
advocates and interested people from a broad spectrum of disciplines and
backgrounds in a balanced public forum to explore and better understand the
definition of our rights at this crossroads.
Participants will include people from the fields of computer science, law,
business, research, information, library science, health, public policy,
government, law enforcement, public advocacy, and many others.
Featured speakers include:
John P. Morgridge, Chairman, Cisco Systems
Esther Dyson, Release 1.0/EDVenture Holdings, Inc.
Roger W. Wilkins, Professor of History and American Culture at George Margaret Jane Radin, Professor of Law, Stanford University
Willis H. Ware, RAND Some of the topics in the CFP'95 program include:
FREEDOM AND RESPONSIBILITY OF ELECTRONIC SPEECH -- Exploring recent
controversies in online free speech, including a Socratic forum
that will ask whether the Constitution can indeed be viewed through a
technologically transparent lens.
HIS MASTER'S VOICE... -- Probing the future for "net propaganda" from
governments, government officials, and politicians, and who will pay so whose message will get to whom.
STUDENT DATABASES: FOR EDUCATION AND FOR LIFE? -- Looking at how gaining the
benefits of nationwide information about K-12 students could also spell
serious privacy problems.
CAN THE NET SURVIVE COPYRIGHT? CAN COPYRIGHT SURVIVE THE NET? -- Delving
into the controversies surrounding copyright protection that throttles freedoms and copyright protection that protects just rewards for creativity.
INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS: PAVING OVER PRIVACY -- Examining the
privacy implications of tracking and surveillance technologies now being
planned for vehicles and roadways nationwide.
"IT OUGHTA BE A CRIME..." -- Debating with law enforcement representatives
about who should set the rules for governing the net and when should bad manners become a crime.
WHEN DO THEY NEED TO KNOW 'WHODUNNIT'? -- Discussing the right time and
places for identified, anonymous, and pseudonymous transactions.
TRANSACTION RECORDS IN INTERACTIVE SERVICES: WHO WATCHES THE SERVERS? --
Looking at the issues raised by the collection of personal information
as part of the new interactive home entertainment, telecommunications,
and online services.
DEFINING ACCESS PARADIGMS: LIBRARIES, RURAL AREAS, AND INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS -- Evaluating the differing models of "open access" to Internet and
computer-mediated communications in the library, rural, and lesser-developed
country contexts.
THE CASE AGAINST COMPUTERS: A SYSTEMIC CRITIQUE -- Daring to discuss whether
computers may be doing our world more harm than good.
A NET FOR ALL: WHERE ARE THE MINORITIES? -- Examining how and to what degree
minority groups participate on the net and asking whether social class is
relevant to net participation or non-participation.
WHO OWNS THE LAW? -- Reviewing the debate over legal citation form and online
databases, and what it means to all of us.
CAN WE TALK LONG-DISTANCE? REMOVING IMPEDIMENTS TO SECURE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNICATIONS -- Covering export and import controls, outright prohibitions,
and other technical and policy obstacles to secure international
The Fifth Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy will also offer a number of in-depth tutorials on subjects including:

I was under the  impression that the House bill would change the status quo in one important respect: under Leon and similar cases, the "good faith" exception only applies when a judge or magistrate has issued a warrant which turns out not to be valid.  Under the House bill, this erosion of the exclusionary rule is extended to warrantless searches (presumably including electronic searches) made in "good faith".  Since knowledge of what the Constitution requires can destroy good faith, the changes likely to be made in police procedure manuals and curricula are left as an exercise for the reader.

@_subject: Certificates/Anonymity/Policy/True Names 
I have a question which is of course purely hypothetical.
Suppose you were designing the legal framework that would govern the operation of Certification Authorities (the people who issue certificates vouching for public keys used for digitial signatures), called CAs for short.  The CAs will operate in a hierarchical model (not a PGP-web-of-trust model), with a state agency being at the root, and issuing certificates for private CAs.
You have decided to allow the private CAs to issue certificates of varying
degrees of corroberation so long as the degree of verification used is
deducible from the certificate.  E.g. a certificate might say "we check
the passport"; or "we check driver's license" or "we took blood, hair,
fingprint, retinal scan and first-born child".  It might even say "we
checked nothing".  You have also decided that a CA may issue a certificate
in the name of a pseudonym, so long as the CA retains information about
the True Name.  Now the issue arises as to whether one should allow the CA
to issue certificates to pseudonyms where it has *no record* of the real
identity of the person proffering the key pair. Is there any reason why a person would want such a certificate?  In other words, given that the recipient of a digital signature will easily be able to check the value of the certificate (nil), won't the transaction/communication be in all ways identical to one where there was no certificate at all.  So is anything of value lost by prohibiting such a certificate?
I understand, of course, that in a world where the CA has no duty to check the client's representations, there is a somewhat farcical element to this debate, but this hypothetical problem involves group decision making and groups find themselves debating irrational things.

Bill Stewart asks what follows from "prohibit".  In the model I am, um, hypothesizing, CAs that play by the rules are entitled to certain safe harbors shielding them from potential liability (e.g. can't be sued if their certificate was used in a transaction that went bad through no fault of theirs).   No other behaviour or act is banned, but other, private, alternatives may suffer a coompetitive disadvantage since they would lack the certainty that they could not be sued.

If we say that others can set themselves up as root too, and that

govt-as-root hierarchy get some advantages (liability caps, primarily),
what are the dangers? National ID cards is one possibility (key becomes a functional ID).

Yeah, but that _doesn't matter_.
The domestic TLA can't afford to embark on massive, wholesale fixing
expeditions this way, even _with_ the escrowed part.  The point is to
fix the unescrowed part at such a size that they can afford to crack a
limited number of keys in a reasonable interval.  Say, at a cost of
about $10000 / key.  That's peanuts for an OKBomb or WTC bomb case,
but it gets to be expensive (hard to hide the expense) if you're
fishing for dirt on members of the opposition party, or investigating
14 year-old Black Panthers.
It also suggests some interesting (and admittedly, abusable) TV shows.

CA certifies key saying that holder has corporate power to enter into deals upto $1million.  Keyholder commits fraud, arguably outside corparate powers.
CA certifies you are Jack Ripper based on phony id.  In fact you are Sam Spade.  CA sued for recovery of ensuing fraud.
CA certifies that a document is authentic and time-stamps it.  Lawyers did not do due dilligence, books were cooked, everyone who touches document gets sued.
In each of these cases, if the CA did exactly what it promises and no more, it (arguably) deserves a way to short-circuit the suit, thus keeping its costs down.
Since (in the absence of any rules given the newness of the technology) it
is very likely that a rich CA would get nuisance suits every time a deal
in which it particiapted went sour, the absence of rules will either raise costs CAs have to charge (e.g. to buy insurance) or will keep rich folk out of the industry (which isn't good either, since you want CAs to buy security and to last).  Thus the need for clear liability rules.

I have been getting a load of duplicate mail from this group; not all messages are duplicated, only those cc'd to mail.cypherpunks as well as sent to the toad.com address.
I don't know if this is a gateway to a local newsgroup or what, but I wish the duplication would stop.  Thank you.  A. Michael Froomkin        | +1 (305) 284-4285; +1 (305) 284-6506 (fax)

For pure RC4, Yes.  However, SSL is not pure RC4.
You are the third person I've heard think of this.
[ The first did quite a lot of calculations before spotting the problem ! ]
Well, the original suggestion I heard was to try 64K at a time :-))

You keep talking about this "Eric Hughes" nym.  I've been a member of this list for weeks, months, over a year even, and I never see any posts from "him".  Is he a dead tentacle?

forgive me for the advertisement, but I *am* a lawyer, and I think this well-intentioned rant gets some stuff wrong.  If you want to know why I think this, visit my homepage and follow the link to my Clipper paper.
Please note the homepage is a bit mobile right now; this address is temporary, but the next one should be stable.

Ah.  but if there is no plaintext, the question is whether you comply with the rule by providing the encrypted text rather than plaintext.  I would say you have to provide the plaintext in the absence of a legitimate privilege claim, but I don't recall a case to this effect (there is precedent for requiring translation of foreign language documents when the request is covered by an evidence conention; I don't recall if there are any such cases that fall purely under domestic US rules).  Anyone have chapter and verse?
