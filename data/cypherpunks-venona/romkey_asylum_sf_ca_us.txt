   I'd much rather have email users want privacy and rag about their
   compromised system. Even a relatively poor one buts some substantial
   blocks into routine bulk monitoring of traffic...
As long as they *know* it's compromised. Too many people out there
think the Internet, for instance, is secure already. They don't
realize how easily one can spy on their email, or find out if they're
subscribed to a mailing list.
