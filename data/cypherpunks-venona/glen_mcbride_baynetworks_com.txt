@_subject: Securing the end-points 
I was wondering if in addition to all the work and discussion regarding
crypto which generally centres around the transmission path information takes
traveling from end-point to end-point, there is any work being done to secure
the end-points themselves (I.e. files on your PC etc.)
In my view the end-points present the most vulnerability in the overall
message path from person to person. It is at these points that the
message/information exists as cleartext even if for a short period of time.
While of course it is possible to PGP encode your files is this a practical
way to go about securing your system? I am aware or RSA secure but is that
all there is out there?
Thanks in advance
