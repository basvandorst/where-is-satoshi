[....] I wouldn't think you would have to use OCR to detect a successful decryption. The graphic file is going to have a highly correlated structure, long runs of white space etc. The statistics for such a file would be different than the random distribution you'd get from using the wrong key. Even if the graphics format is compressed, leading to a more even distribution, there might be known plaintext at the beginning of the file, headers, size etc.

I've got the Viacrypt Business Edition for Windows. It arrived late last
week. I don't think the personal edition is shipping yet.
The business edition adds features for corporate key escrow and limiting features available to users. I've just started playing with the software, but
it looks like some of the user control features are implemented using security through obscurity. The windows implementation is ok, but does not include DDE or OLE. The floating toolbar looks useful.
4.0 will interoperate with current versions of PGP as long as a normal key is generated. 4.0 allows for generation of keys limited to signing or encryption. These keys will not interoperate with current versions of PGP.
I'll know more as I use the software. If anyone has any specific question, feel free to ask.
