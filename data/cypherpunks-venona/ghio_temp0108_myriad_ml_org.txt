Using a salt would work.  DH would be okay if you used DH to exchange
a different key with each recipient and then conventionally encrypted
the message with that key.
The point is that you need to use different (random) inputs to each P-K
operation in order to avoid the possibility of ending up with a system
of equations that could be solved.
