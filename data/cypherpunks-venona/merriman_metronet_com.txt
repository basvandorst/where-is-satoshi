@_subject: Remailers 
I 'know' that a decent remailer will time-delay forwarding messages so as
to throw sand in the gears of traffic analysis.  I wonder if it wouldn't
help more if the remailer(s) were set up so that people could send 'dummy'
messages to them.
That is, say I wanted to ensure that traffic analysis on myself were made
as difficult as possible.  I could Email something to a remailer with an
embedded 'flag' or code (ex: blackhole, disposal, trash, etc) telling it
to forward the message to the Bitbucket.  Alternatively, I could include
some other code or flag (ex: rubber, bounce, ricochet, etc) telling it to
take the included (dummy) data, scramble it some, and return it some
random time later.
Alternatively, the remailer could take a so-tagged message, generate some
random data of similar size, and send it (along with my address) to
another remailer that it knew about, which would generate *different*
random data, and sent that back to me.
Wouldn't something like this further complicate traffic analysis, or would
it just constipate the net?

@_subject: Today's Dumb Question? 
I've got what may turn out to be Today's Dumb Question....
What Happens If, instead of using prime numbers or logarithms for the
basis for a public-key crypto system, we instead generated out public key
1> pick an arbitrary bit stream (large [pseudo?]random number, binary
representation of selected chunk of text or data file, etc).  1024 bits or
more (in 256 bit chunks?)
2> enter a passphrase
3> XOR the bit stream with the binary representation of the passphrase,
cycling the passphrase as necessary.  This makes the 'large' component of
our public key.
4> hash the passphrase to 128 or more (in blocks of 64?) bits.  This makes
the 'small' component of the public key.
5> We then use these components as in normal public-key algorithms.
Conceptually (to me), this would seem to work, and have the advantage of
not being dependent on the factorability of any number; that is, the
numbers could be extended as necessary fairly simply.  It would also seem
to depend on the entry of a passphrase that would be securely 'locked'
inside someone's mind :-)  Too, it wouldn't seem to be subject to any kind of patents.  Finally, if
the arbitrary bit stream were taken from something like a section of text
in a file, a sequence of bytes in a data file, or even absolute
track/sector reads from a floppy/hard disk, the entire thing could be
rendered useless by the user by simply erasing/wiping a single file or

Grady Ward, over on alt.security.pgp/sci.crypt posted a little something
to the effect (I'm paraphrasing, here) that sending a couple meg of random
noise/bytes to an out-of-U.S. person/site would probably be a Good Thing
To Do.  The idea is that if each of us were to send out something like an
encrypted list of insults/profanity/noise, then the occasional *real*
message/file wouldn't stand out so much (plus have the added benefit of
screwing with the system in general). I realize that this is just fundamental
traffic analysis, but going through the list of remailers I've got, I could
see only a single non-U.S. (or at least, clearly identifiable as such) site.
Would it be completely out of line to ask if any of our non-US/Canada (or
Canada/US, if you prefer :-) subscribers would make available some kind of
Email drop to facilitate such activity?  It wouldn't have to be terribly
responsive, I wouldn't think - simply redirecting the appropriately
addressed mail to the bitbucket would be fine for the most part.  The
Really Motivated might take the file, rotate it left or right a bit, and
XOR it with the original of itself and send it back in some variable number
of chunks (or multiplied by 1/2 pi, or.....  anyway, you get the idea).
Incidental question: do the anon remailers do anything to erase any 'ghost' images of data that has gone through them?  I mean, after they've
forwarded a message, do they do anything like wipe the scratch files, or
overwrite them with random data, or some similar bit-scrambling?  Or is
the traffic high enough that such measures don't have to be specifically

It has been brought up on the Cypherpunks mailing list that Microsoft is proposing to include public-key escrow as a *built-in* "function" of future products - Chicago and Daytona have been specifically mentioned.
Is this, in fact, correct?  If so, what constraints or limitations are there on it?  Is it an optional capability, and if so, what means are there for disabling (or better still, completely removing) it?  What organization(s) does Microsoft propose to use as the escrow agent(s) if such public-key escrow is implemented?  What would be the system used (RIPEM, RSA, etc)?  If not an existing algorithm, would the algorithm(s) be made public?  What would be the key size of any such algorithm?
I would appreciate any and all information you could provide regarding this _very_ serious matter.

This may have been hashed out in a previous incarnation, but on the subject of remailers and their availability, why not just have each one broadcast a message of it's availability periodically (hourly? every 4 hours?) on, say, the Cypherpunks mailing list.  Then, each remailer could also listen in, read in who's up, and if it doesn't hear from a remailer within some period of time (or some number of scheduled broadcasts), assume that it's down until it hears from that system again.  This would also allow individuals to maintain personal listings of available remailers, as well, and automate the process of keeping track of what remailers are         The additional traffic wouldn't seem to be _too_ much of a burden, those individuals who didn't want the broadcasts cluttering up their mailboxes could filter them out, and doesn't require massive effort or changes to implement (ie, new newsgroups, etc).
        What blazingly obvious thing am I missing here, or does it make too much sense to work? :-)

Okay, every 8 hours.  Now we're down to 60 messages - not too different than a lively C'punks day. :-)
So instead of one central remailer, we use some number of 'regional' listservers (4 remailers, each handling 5 'local' remailers).  Then if one croaks, it's a minimal loss to the system.

C'punks remailer was used as a f'rinstance (functionality example).  So there's a different remailer mailing list, and a banks remailer mailing list, and money provider's mailing list, ad nauseum.

Externally, the guns look *very* similar - you've got to get close enough to count the barrels (which is too damn close, if it _really_ matters :-) to be sure: 20mm uses 6 barrels, 30mm uses 4 (at least, at the time I was there - mid-80's). Either shoots 4,000 rounds/minute. Then you've got everyone's favorite, the 40mm, firing 3,000 rounds/minute through 3 barrels.  If you had to compare a 40mm and a milk bottle in a dark room, the milk bottle is probably the small one :-)
Not something I'd want to be on the receiving end of, in any case. Of course, we all realize that the size of the ammo refers to the projectile, not the casing, which is typically about half again the projectile diameter, for 'cased' ammo.

I finally got around to calling the number that was posted along with the announcement of Williams and Macias' bumper sticker printer stock of a few weeks ago.  They were quite willing to send me samples of it :-)  When it shows up, I'll take it for a 'test drive' and let you all know how it turns Their number is 1-800-310-0890, if you want to play with it yourself.

@_subject: RE: E.C.T. 
The ECT proposal sounds pretty good, and I'd like to toss in my nickle's What to do about the non-Unix (and Unix variants) world?  Granted that the majority of the net is "unix" based, there are still a *lot* of folks that run MSDOS, Windows, Amigas, Ataris, and god-knows-what-else.  If they can't 'play', that would seem to put a semi-serious limitation on the testbed.  What hooks are going to be available to let the other kids play? (I count myself in there - I run Windows)
There was recently a not-so-brief thread about what to call the electronic "cash" - why not just go with that old Sci-Fi standby of "credits" (abbreviated C| ?  Or the copyright symbol?)? It's not specific to any country/currency, and fairly accurately describes the nature of the medium.
Are the creditbanks going to be available on a 24-hour basis, with the attendant load/reliability questions?  If not, what to do about overdrafts, or refusals-of-service because a creditbank is 'down'?  How to deal with getting account balances (if appropriate)?  Do we handle the transactions as cash (each "bill" serial numbered and sealed)) or checks (available in virtually any "denomination" - with the related check-based concerns)? If it's going to be in "denominational" form, how are these "bills" going to be identified? This is related to the unix/MSDOS/Atari/Amiga/??? question - discrete monetary denominations should at least have filenames that are usable by all participants (regrettably, that means the MSDOS limitation of 8.3 - *sigh*).  If checks, what format do they take (I'll assume they'll still meet the minimum filename limitations of MSDOS)? How are the credits actually transferred (ie, how would I send C|35 to Tim May :-) - attachment, inclusion (uuencoded?  MIME?), or ????  Would I be correct that these credits would only be available in integer units?
Please understand - I'm not trying to throw cold water on the idea, or pretend I'm playing "devil's advocate", or anything of the sort.  I like the idea of implementing a testbed for e-money, and would like to contribute whatever I can: I've followed the e-money discussions as theory, but my 'real world' job is as an engineering tech - the one who tries to get from the design/theory stage to real implementation.  You "engineers" get to work out the gory details of what's the best "design"; us "technicians" have to work out the details of how to implement your designs - and provide feedback when something doesn't "look right", or ask questions when there's a _perceived_ problem with the implementation.  The design/implementation process generally works best when the engineer can tell the technician what he's trying to do, and the technician gets to provide feedback by asking dumb questions about why and how and what-happens-if :-)
Finally, I think it would be better if the foundation for the ECT were in place before trying to spread the gospel, so to speak.  I know that's kind of obvious, but if we had the creditbanks in place, the creditnotes or creditchecks available, and the tools (MS-Windows CreditWriter?  Atari CreditPurse?) to allow unix/DOS/Atari/Amiga users to actually use the system, more folks would be willing to at least give it a *try*. It's the old bird-in-the-hand vs two-in-the-bush deal.......
One thing did occur to me after reading the ECT proposal: it would seem to be ideal for mailing lists and moderated newsgroups. Someone wanting to post an article/message pays (say) C|10 for the privelege; if others like it, they send the author C|1.  Flamers don't make much (if any) money, and good stuff increases wealth. Leaves folks free to write whatever they want, but not for free (translation: you've *really* got to want to say it before you'll pay for it).  Kinda brings new meaning to the phrase "putting in my .02 worth" Dave Merriman -

@_subject: Acapulco H.E.A.T. Auxilliary Review 
Well, here we go, sports fans - an alternative review of Acapulco H.E.A.T.
In this weeks' episode, the plot was that an Iranian freighter had gone down
in the waters off Acapulco - with stolen Russian U-235 aboard (enough to
make Iran a Nuclear Power).
The heavy (with an atrocious generic Slavic accent) was trying to recover
said uranium for sale to Iran ($50M price tag - keep it in mind).
Our Fearless Team was assisted by a world-famous salvage diver.  Since
nearly all the "action" took place underwater (duh!) at 17 fathoms (102 feet
to you non-Navy/sailing types :-) the bikini count was inordinately low.
Ditto on gun battles.  Ditto on explosions.  Ditto on
crypto/computer/privacy - the closest we got was a database search of
typhoon patterns.  No Fabio.  There *was* a brief flurry of goodguy/badguy
underwater WWF action, but considering that their alleged bottom time for
the dives was 25 minutes (any diver confirmation out there?), it not only
didn't last long, but wasn't terribly productive.
Toward the end, the H.E.A.T. team succeeded in recovering the stolen
uranium; interestingly, it appeared to be contained in a single box,
approximately 2' x 18" x 18" - what with shielding, etc, I don't know that
there was $50M worth inside.
Something to look forward to: next week, the team goes to Panama to deal
with an Evil Drug Lord.  From the preview clips, it looks to have a fairly
high bikini count - and they appeared to be some very nice bikinis, indeed :-)

other was a patch (command-line switch?) to increase the available number of

@_subject: Re: HIT MEN 
If the escrow agent has a reputation for reliability, honesty, integrity,
etc, then the nature of the transaction is irrelevant.  Any reasonably
intelligent hit man would have sense enough not to commit all his 'business'
to any single escrow agent, just as no reasonably intelligent C'punk would
trust all his/her mail to a single remailer.
I still don't see the problem: the whole process is anonymized.  There is no
reason that the escrow agent would have to know *why* the "money" is in
escrow, nor who the financer is, nor who the recipient is to be.  All that
is necessary is for the hit man to provide suitably disguised/encrypted
evidence that the terms have been met.  Presumably, the person contracting
the hit would be aware of how to go about setting all this up would have
sufficient wit to establish a means of independent validation; if not, then
the hit man would certainly have sufficient motive to do so :-)
The only *fundamental* feature of an escrow agency is it's reputation for
reliability/stability/security/etc.  The nature of the transactions simply
don't matter, just as a remailer's reliability is based on it's up-time,
cycle time, input/ouput isolation, etc, regardless of the nature of the
messages passing through it.
What sorts of clients?  The ones that pay the escrow fee?  Doubtless, the
escrow agency would have a means of ensuring their own payment :-)
True enough - *but only as long as the nature of the service could be
identified*, which would not apply to a properly operated escrow agency.

Got my samples of bumper sticker stock from Williams & Macias today, and it looks *real* good.  Nice, heavy paper, feels like some kind of plastic coating on it to make it weather-resistant.  The description sheet that came with it says that it can also be run through copiers and offset presses, that it can be drawn on directly, and takes color (dry-toner).  W&M is calling them SlapSticks.
The 2041 (3 stickers/sheet) has 3 short (but full-width) areas; the 2042 has 2 full-height areas.  The stuff also comes with two different adhesives: "temporary" and "removable".  The "temporary" is to allow washing off with soap and water; the "removable" is more durable.  From the descriptions, it sounds like the difference between a post-it note, and adhesive tape (roughly). Each sticker is on it's own little die-cut area, and the areas are separated with perfs to make separation easier.
Prices are $19.95 for 20 sheets, with Bumper Sticker Remover fluid for the "removeable" stickers at $2.75 for 11 oz. can.
2x41 is 3 stickers/sheet, 2x42 is 2 stickers/sheet.  Replace x with 0 for removable adhesive, use 1 for "temporary".

        > two-pass swim/climb: guys come in from out at sea, girls climb
rope.  One guy rides paddleboard in, tags girl who climbs rope to release
flag, which signals other guy to swim in from raft - said guy then tags same
girl who releases additional flag.
        > hill climb: guys & girls climb wet plastic fake hills, run back to
beginning, tag another team member who climbs, until all have gone over the
        > raft drag: guy team member on jet ski pulls girl team member
hanging onto inflatable raft.
        > VolleySmash: 4-person/team volleyball on a giant airmattress

@_subject: Re: SUFFERANCE remailers 
I see two modes of tracking a remailer: physical or electrical (signal)
tracing of it's connection(s).
The solutions I can think of, right off the top of my head, are to either
make it excessively difficult to find, or excessively difficult to *access*.
The first can be dealt with either by using a wireless link of some kind
(radio lan, comm laser, etc), or physical confusion of the link (running it
into a sealed room with umpteen bajillion other identical links so that it
wouldn't be possible to literally trace the cable). Another choice is a
touch more difficult, but not insurmountable: repetitive links physically
isolated (first option, multiplied), so that any given message packet could
be sent across any given non-physical link, and still arrive at the
remailer: array of wireless links on different frequencies
(frequency-hopping to confuzzle triangulation?), or bank of uncolliminated
or diffused (to increase the possible target area, per the first choice)
lasers pointed in different directions toward repetitive, dispersed optical
links.  Variation on the laser option would be to have a single Tx/Rx pair,
but bounce the laser beam off the moon (it's been done). The transfer rate
would probably eat dirt, but _do-able_.
The second is a bit tougher: I can't think of anything that isn't accessible
without sufficient motivation (I mean, the CIA built a damn ship for the
sole purpose of recovering a sunken USSR sub, f'chrissake). This is further
amplified by the fact that it wouldn't be strictly necessary to access the
hardware itself to take it off line: cutting power or comm links to it would
be just as effective as dismantling it, as would something like detonating
an underground nuke a few hundred meters away and just vibrating it to death.
If we're not limited by reality, hang it off a small nuke power source, link
it to a transoceanic cable, and drop it in the ocean (someplace nice and deep).
I'll leave any other options as an exercise for the rest of the list :-)

to regain control over their destinies.
For the purpose of discussion, I'd like to propose the following
"environmental variables":
willing to support those that do know.
depart the country in a short period bridging the implementation of
repressive government controls and laws.
force-capable (ie, hackers-only to bomb-makers-only, and anything in between).
attempting to resist, as well as intercept communications, prevent damage to
it's infrastructure and physical entities.
remailers are seized or shut down, and access to international ones is
*heavily* monitored or blocked (yeah, I know, but we're gaming here!).
to build a Backpack Nuke" or "How to hack the Tax Gestapo central computers"
books :-)
What problems would those willing to fight such government oppression be
likely to face?  How to deal with those problems?  How to organize and
exchange personnel/information?  How to not get caught?  How to avoid
detection? What means/methods of, um, dissonance against such a government
would be more/less effective? Under what various permutations of
electronic/physical bushwhacking would the process be successful or not?
Duration?  Other than the obvious crypto/cyber/military disciplines, what
other professions or specialized knowledge would be useful under what
conditions? What blatantly obvious thing(s) have I left out?

up with, as a test for the bumper sticker stock from Williams & Macias. I
*was* going to just go ahead and ftp it to the berkeley site (probably still
will), but it turned out small enough that I didn't figure folks would mind
_too_ much if I posted it, as well.  Printing it at 300 dpi resolution on a

@_subject: Re: Electronic Revolution and Guerilla Warfare? 
You're right about the mountainous areas being fairly easy to guerrilla
from; ditto the *major* urban areas due to their population densities.
We've got borders that couldn't be effectively closed - and held that way -
without an expenditure that would surely break any government over the long
run.  Relatively minor urban areas (say, under half-million population)
would be fairly easily monitored and controlled.
Communications would be a pure bitch without some kind of web-of-trust
similar to PGP's. Ditto personnel or other underground transfers.  The first
few years of the movement would see incredible caualties, either by way of
death or captures, until the participants learned that it was "for-real".
Acts of violence and sabotage would be sparse at first, because that kind of
knowledge isn't particularly needed or wanted these days. In a large
country, and as large as such a government would have to be, simple physical
sabotage and destruction wouldn't cut it. There would *have* to be people
working on the command/control/communications side, logistics, etc, as well:
getting some phreak to go in an turn the local Baby Bell substation's
circuit into a pretzel, for example; or hacking an order for supplies so as
to leave out something important, but not *critical*, so as to
As many miles of train track as we have in this country, and considering how
much of our food and raw materials still travel by rail, it wouldn't be
terribly difficult to randomly de-spike some of the rail and wait for a
train to catch it wrong - particularly on a curve.
Killing of low- and mid-level government officials (the upper level ones
would have some degree of security/protection) would become a new "sport" -
one has to wonder how many folks would be willing to be tax collectors if
the survival rate for them was, say, 6 months. If the military got dragged
in to helping the government (almost a necessity) it wouldn't take long
before Billy Bob from Lubbock caught on that the same kind of harm he was
causing Mrs. O'leary in Chicago was probably happening to *his* momma by
someone from Seattle.
As noted, propaganda/PR would become *very* important - I doubt such a
government could maintain any kind of pretense that things weren't going
wrong for them. Key though, would have to be honesty on the part of the
revolutionists - they wouldn't be likely to win friends and influence
enemies if they lied as badly, and often, as such a government would have to.
Other skills/occupations that I've thought of that would help would be
things like engineers (who would know better how to take down a bridge than
a civil engineer?), burglar alarm folks (obvious reasons), and so on - in
short, the kinds of folks that have to deal with abstract concepts in a
creative way.  Most valuable of all would be the folks that had as much
diverse theoretical knowledge as possible, with practical experience to
temper it.  Someone with military experience and knowledge of computer
systems, crypto, electricity/electronics, mechanical/civil engineering,
chemistry (at least, "practical" kind, like home-brew ordnance), military
tactics and strategy, logistics, communications, planning and organization,
medicine (say, knowing how much Jimson weed juice to add to a 5-gallon
coffee urn to make a guard force bonkers), and of course, a healthy dose of
suspicion/paranoia. Someone with all these attributes, plus a taste for
action/adventure/war/crime stories and a good memory for their details,
would likely be worth his/her weight in C-4.

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:
The "Digital Librarian" links together the libraries where
information of any type (books, texts, pictures, audio, video,
multi-media, etc.) is stored to the librarians who assist the
users in navigating through these storehouses of knowledge.  This
project brings these ideas to the desktop by allowing a user to
gain access to any number of information sources, independent of
the originating development of the sources.  The information
sources can be anything from databases to online reference
materials to online training materials.  The user interacts with
these sources through one common interface.
In addition, this project enhances textual material searches by
providing a hypertext link capability for a user to navigate a
document in a more meaningful way.  Instead of just paging
through a document one page at a time, the system can bring the
user to the place in the document where the information is
located.  In the future, natural language and artificial
intelligence techniques will be exercised to increase user
efficiency in searching through the library storehouses of

external scripts and such to the Mac version of Eudora slows down the
program's operation more than necessary. If there were a Mac resource (of
whatever kind - I'm not Mac-fluent) that the nice folks over at QualComm
could use to build crypto into the program to start with
then they wouldn't have the excuse of "we can't because there's nothing to

    * That Eric has had ample opportunity to see the response to his
proposal, and will therefore take it into consideration as he feels appropriate.
    * That the subject will not be properly addressed and resolved until and
unless some _definitive_ action occurs.
    * That until and unless such action occurs, anything else is so much
flailing about madly, with a fair measure of High Blood Pressure and Hurt

I may have missed earlier bits of this thread, so I'll simply point out that
it is quite possible to run PGP from a floppy disk - either having the
entire program on floppy, or just the keys. It's what I do when I may need
access from an 'unsecure' machine.

I kinda suspect that by now, the subject has been thoroughly flogged to

Does anyone know if any of the 'standard' CP tools (remailers, etc) would
run on a Windows NT machine (server edition 3.5)? A couple friends and I are
under serious contemplation of setting up an ISP in a town of 100K+, and if
it's possible, I'd like to put an anon remailer on it.

Recycled PGP sig header above :-)
I expect it will be a remailer-friendly site - the other two guys are even
less computer-literate than I am, so I get to be the IS Manager :-/
If the NT-based tools were available, I'd be agreeable (even enthusiastic)
about setting up "independent" remailers on it (ie, Tim's Remailer-in-a-box
[my box, but what the heck :-]). We're looking at calling the site
genisys.net, so additional remailers could be remailer
remailer or whatever. Hell, if all folks wanted was a
remailer, I might even be convinced to offer remailer-only accounts at a
discount :-)
I'm still looking into what kind of magic I need to invoke to get it to all
happen in the right order (IP address, then register the domain, do them in
parallel, or ???. Any rules/restrictions on what we can call our site (we'll
be incorporated, but can we call the site ???.net/org/???], etc.).

the CP list, vice the originator?

Sorry to divert everyone from the other threads, but I happen to have some
somewhat crypto-related question:
Back some time ago, there was some discussion of giving away disks at Comdex
in NY; by any chance, does anyone have a copy of the contents of what was on
those disks?  I'd like to be able to give away 'basic info' in
easy-to-handle format :-)
Thank for any help/pointers.

@_subject: hiatus 
Just a short note to let folks know that I'll be unsubscribing for a while
(probably a couple of months) while I get ready and then move to Amarillo to
set up an ISP :-)
The staging phase is taking up a large portion of my time, and I really
don't have the slack to do more than give the subject lines in the CP list a
cursory glance these days - just enough to see what the current flame war is
about :-)
Once I get the ISP set up, I'll be putting an anon remailer on it; I may
also offer "Remailer-in-a-box" accounts for some relatively minor fee (if
motivated, I may even take digicash as payment :-). I don't expect any
problems about setting up accounts, since I'll be the MIS Manager, VP
Engineering, etc, etc. Too, since the service will be commercial, I expect
that I'll be able to do a pretty fair job of ignoring complaints of the kind
that get .edu and on-the-left remailers shut down.
I'll still be able to receive email at this account at least until the end
of February; once I get set up in Amarillo, I'll resub and let everyone know
where I am (just in case anyone cares :-)
FYI, the tentative name for the ISP is panhandle.net.....

@_subject: EFF Renewal response 
25 January, 1995
1557 K Street, Ste. 801
Washington, DC   20006
really quite simple: I do not believe that certain past actions of the EFF
have been to the benefit of "the electronic frontier" - so much so that I
feel I must question whether the EFF truly represents my views.
While the EFF was right in opposing this legislation, I believe that it was
grievously in error to make any kind of 'compromise' with federal officials
by assisting in the wording of the Act. While the EFF's stated position was
that it considered the legislation 'inevitable', and sought to make it as
palatable as possible, I do not believe that the EFF's willingness to
cooperate was appropriate at all. The EFF's actions have been likened to a
dog that barks quite loudly at a burglar, and then rolls over to have it's
belly rubbed when offered a treat by that same burglar - a description I
find to be more appropriate than that put forward by EFF representatives
(which, incidentally, sounded quite similar to the old adage "if you're
going to be raped, you might as well lay back and enjoy it." - an attitude I
find offensive in either context).
cyberspace is quite laudable, I do not see how such protection is possible
by compromising with the political and philosophical equivalents of thieves,
brigands, rapists, and common thugs. By cooperating with federal officials,
you have granted them the sanction of legitimizing their position, rather
than holding it up as an example of the untoward intrusion and violation of
the personal rights and freedoms of the citizens of cyberspace that more
accurately described it - and you have do so for the political equivalent of
30 pieces of silver.
EFF, with it's actions regarding the Digital Telephony bill has completely
and thoroughly 'thrown away' any trust or faith in it's position, policies,
or effeciacy that I may have once had.
