@_subject: Use of PGP---statistics from the public key servers 
The following table shows the frequency breakdown, by key generation  month, just over the past year, of the approx. 3300 public keys that  are available on the public key servers (I used the one at  ).  Note that I've included  revoked keys, but there are only 19 of these from the same time  period.  In other words, of the keys out there, 211 of them were generated in  March of 1993, 216 in April, etc.  I have no idea if these numbers correlate well to actual PGP use  (these are, after all, just the people who are activist enough to  post their key on the public key server, which also requires some  degree of Internet connectivity).  If the numbers DO correlate to  some degree, I thought it was interesting that they appear to show a  recent decline in usage rather than a steady ramp-up.  Is the trend  toward universal crypto slacking off?
