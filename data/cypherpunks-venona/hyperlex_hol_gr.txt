Not at all easy, for a lot of people. Moreover, it's very time-consuming.
It's only easy if you are prepared to put up with costs of time, money,
and also... service providers (who don't always agree with you)...
In a lot of places in the world, starting mailing lists is almost
impossible unless you can be _inside_ an Internet Provider Company
(and use Unix or whatever they use, in their own machines).
Perhaps cynical, though? :-)
Man you're nutts. There are very few and quite vast Media Companies
in the world, and they're on the verge of becoming monopolies.
Even your American President is in reality a puppet of the Trilateral
Commission, who effectively also control CNN, the Washington Post,
and many many many other things all over the world.
And you are saying that control of the media by ownership is
impossible?  You're far out maaan! :-)
Only in America such a naive opinion could actually be _believed_.

about _freedoms_, that if you Americans lose, the rest of the world will

Indeed. But it's not only a question of 'size'. Perhaps less people might
take part, but it would still be a _public_ list, just as an "open meeting"
announced to take place in a _private_ house, is still an open meeting.
Does the fact that the _building_ used by the meeting is private and
possibly donated for this purpose make the meeting less public (than
explicitly announced)?
This analogy (meeting = mailing-list, building-owner=list-owner) is
_quite_ exact, as a matter of fact, and it's not at all a 'party'.
Yep. Morevover, ANOTHER _sense_ in which the cypherpunks list is
PUBLIC is the following:  Posters are the _owners_ of their _ideas_.
So the messages in the list are the (intellectual) property of the
people who wrote them; not the list-owner's. The false analogy here
is between a mailing list and a newspaper; But the newspaper (1) is
sold in ALL public places (2) is dependent on money and works (in the
end) for the financial best interests of its owner, and (3) is not
interactive, i.e. the readers are not at all _also_ writers in it.
We have to clear these things up, dear aga, and no longer misunderstand
each other. Perhaps when I burst out (one of the first) against Dimitri's
expulsion I shouldn't have used the adjective 'Yankee', in denouncing
the mentality you also denounce. The reason I said 'Yankee' is because
it seems to be _very_ common in your part of the world. It's not because
I 'hate' or 'envy' Yanks! But I strongly believe that there are quite
common _assumptions_ appearing again and again throughout the Net,
which _do_ originate in the States, among the people you _also_ oppose.
In my part of the world, NOBODY would EVER, seriously claim that an "open
meeting" held in his house is subject to his "censorship". Then the
meeting would by definition NOT be public...
Other than these (serious points) we both seem to love our countries
and this has nothing to do with nationalism or petty patriotism (IMO).
THIS is a very SERIOUS point: Censorship is like... prostitution.
The first time a person accepts money to offer a... blow-job, is
sufficient for the loss of all sexual credibility. Similarly, people
who ban someone from some medium of expression become _PIMPS_, which
is far worse than whores (whose therapeutic role has been grossly
underestimated by the world's cultures)... ROTFL!!!!
Indeed, in my country, we use the word "pimp" for an editor who
sacks journalists because of disagreeing with their opinions.
(even though as I said the 'journalism' analogy is irrelevant here).
Finally, only a fool or a bigot would fail to realize the
seriousness and the correctness of what aga has said.
So I shake your hand, Yankee rascal! :-)

Setting up a mailing list is not _that_ easy, but it's still much more
intricate and difficult than accepting the Basic Principles of Free
Expression: DON'T KICK OUT GUESTS YOU INVITE TO "OPEN MEETINGS".
(In the Internet or anywhere else in fact). If you don't like 'em

  ^^^
VERY IMPORTANT ($1000-) QUESTION HERE!
( I've often wondered myself... )
i.e. (the wider issue) HOW does cowardice manage to *fake* power?
Well, having lived outside my country for about 15 years, at first
I tried to blame... some nationalities (such as the English) for
possessing the cowardice which is the root of the problem.
(-NOT true, in fact. Being "reserved" is not always "cowardly").
Then I blamed the... gullible Americans; then my... "buzuki-minded"
Greek compatriots (those who've never been outside their villages).
(BTW a "buzuki" is a fuckin-awful Greek/Turkish musical instrument
 I can't stand, which puts me in the minority over here)... :-)
However, it's a deeper and wider problem than such narrow "national"
explanations. Boils down to _personal_ growth, maturity, tolerance,
and the ability to respond in a "tit-for-tat" basis, rather than a
"look mummy what they've done to me" mentality-basis (TM/worldwide).
Another way of looking at it is this: DO NOT carry guns when going
to the... saloon (or to the Internet discussion)... :-)
( A list-owner's _only_ gun is "forcible unsubcription". )
Tit-for-Tat is simple enough, and does NOT always imply escalation;
e.g. If someone calls me an asshole, I _also_ call the guy an
asshole. It doesn't have to continue... Then (and only then)
_if_ he and I calm down, we MIGHT buy each other drinks!
The Anglo-Saxon way of Politeness and the Greek way of Expressiveness
are not incompatible, BTW: Oscar Wilde said that "A gentleman is a man
who knows _when_ to be rude".
Of course, gentlemen ALSO make mistakes. (AND admit them, bravely;
in direct contrast to the view that "a man admits no mistake").
But if you called me an asshole, and I REFRAINED from answering back,
becoming friends again would be indeed humiliating: THIS is the Greek
way, as I understand it; Insults can be *CATHARTIC*. Censoring insults
is HIDEOUS, HOSTILE, and DANGEROUS. I can forgive ANY insult, but NOT
an act of censorship. Either we speak as equals, or else we kill each
other. And censorship is like _spiritual_ MURDER, philosophically.
I also never understood why an insult offends the "insultee"; Is not
"hurt" an indication that the "offensive" attributions are TRUE?
Some of my English friends never understood why the Greeks burst
out in laughter with some of the most horrifying insults... :-)
  **********************************************************
A ha ha! :-)
Indeed (and it rhymes!)
Minor Correction: (Once pulling a plug) one is a pimp, not a whore.
A whore's worst problem is that she OBEYS her pimp.
And we intend NOT TO become WHORES for the benefit of (would-be-)
Net-pimps censoring us in order to hide their cowardice in REAL life.
Why do I agree with Aga? My life outside the Net guarantees SOME sanity;
E.g. the climate here allows me to swim nearly every day in the beach! :-)
(except in December/January/February). So,
I prefer to be liked for what I am, or what I do in _real_ life, rather
than for my... scribbles in the Net (as I write for... pleasure mostly!)
"A beautiful female ass is worth a thousand Buddhas".
                        (Greek... Heterosexist Zen-saying). :-)
P.S.2 (added later)
Semantically speaking, the word "poutana"(whore) in Greek can also mean...
someone really clever, ya know. So let's not underestimate whores! :-)
Here is a list of a few WEIRD semantic connotations in the Greek language:
"Big Whore"  ("megali poutana")  =  Very shrewd clever guy; Shrewd salesman.
"Big Faggot" ("megalos poustis") =  Very Devious (or Secretive) Impauster.
"Big Wanker" ("megalos malakas") =  Very gullible stupid guy; Clueless fool.
"Big Pimp"   ("megalo-tavatzis") =  Authoritarian or Censorous Media Director.
The sexual connotations are often LOST; those listed above are more valid. :)
Complaints about "political correctness" are irrelevant. You hear gay people
call each other "poustis" and women call each other the same names too...

You forget that Astrology is... unsuitable for gullible children. :-)
Don't know who the hell Don Wood is.  However, I bet you _also_ don't know who Mr. Stringas is. Well, he is the author
of several books about his experience as a prominent C.I.A. official
working for the Trilateral Commission, a former NATO official who
acted as a "link" between the Athens government and Washington, and
he also (at the age of 70+) doesn't give a damn about anyone putting
a bullet in his head (or so he says) which is unlikely anyway since
it would be too "obvious".
Mr. Stringas is not the only one who wrote thousands of pages about
the Trilateral Commission's activities and members (e.g. Clinton).
However, you seem to dismiss well-known facts for the simple reason
that they were originally posted by an astrologer (E. Francis) and
apparently you believe astrologers are by nature non-credible.
That's fine with me. As a highly analytical Virgo with Venus in
Libra, I understand you very well.  :-)
I will reply with a real life JOKE, in this case:
Two days ago I had a rather official meeting with some nice people
with whom we negotiated a contract (of details irrelevant here).
Carrying my notebook computer (as I always do) with several astrology
programs inside it, I actually took it out and made a horoscope for
my... lawyer, who ALSO happens to be a Virgo with Venus in Libra, and
this was hilarious, since we _now_ understood our... similarities.
Then a gentleman came into the room who remarked that Astrology is
only suitable for loonies and gullible morons. He added that for
these people, the Greek word "zodion" applies except without the
'd' and the 'i' in the 3rd and 4rth places inside the word 'zodion'
('Zodion' means 'Zodiac sign'). (If you delete those characters,
you are left with the word 'Zoon' which means 'animal').
An astrologer friend of mine, also in the same room, immediately
replied: Aha! But the way you phrased it, Sir, makes you surely a
virgo, too; probably with a Virgo ascendant, I would say.
The guy stared at us in terror. He WAS a Virgo, and had a Virgo
ascendant, as he himself said.
He promptly stopped talking and looked rather thoughtful...
Perhaps a... coincidence? :-)
Have fun (with astrology).

I think the expulsion of Dimitri Vulis is HIGHLY on-topic inside the
Freedom Knights List.
As it happens, it is ALSO on topic in the cypherpunks list, no matter
how HARD you try to forget this.
After censoring Dimitri, you will also NATURALLY try to censor others
too, such as myself (receiving notices that I stop "cross-posting" to
the cypherpunks list).
However, you are a HYPOCRITICAL ASSHOLE, becayse you ALSO cross-post
to your own (cypherpynks) list. What you CLEARLY want is to HAVE
THE "LAST WORD" ABOUT THIS ISSUE.
This is typical of all censorship. If your request was SINCERE, you
would be the FIRST to NOT CROSS-POST IT to the cypherpunks list.
Oh Gods of Olympus!  :-)
You mean whatever you disagree with, or perhaps don't bother to read,
you dismiss as 'worthless crap'.
It's funny, this attitude. I find it philosophically inexcusable.
I never dismiss the opinions of others as "worthless crap" when they
are expressed eloquently. What I said instead is that "VERY important
ideas have been expressed from all sides". Perhaps you didn't notice.
You have begun REDEFINING "SPAM" according to your personal feelings
and opinions. "SPAM" as EVERYONE ELSE understands it, implies some kind
of _gain_ (e.g. from advertising) inside a posting.
Redefining "SPAM" is consistent with attempts to redefine other known
words as well. Like the word "Censorship", which has been redefined
to mean "ONLY official censorship".
The tendency of closed-minded internet communities to REDEFINE common
words as they deem fit, is RATHER WELL KNOWN, where I come from.
I am a dictionary maker by profession, BTW. (I write some of the
software for it, and run the business. OK, I also do spelling mistakes.
It's not my job to know everything, ya know! :-) :-) )
However, if you take my own opinions for instance, they are expressed
without ANY thought of gain (by definition impossible, since I don't
advertise anything. I write these texts at the intervals of a very
real life, involving a lot of swimming, and a lot of Research. When
my friends and I meet, we laugh a lot with the situation thousands
of miles across the ocean, where... EVEN a "cypherpunks" mailing list
has evicted someone forcibly. Rather typical, as it happens. Gives
you people a bad name you know...

Neither do I, or my friends who heard about it.
What worries me is that people still subscribe to the cypherpunks list
after this assault on free speech takes place.
If pimps like Gilmore ever succeed in controlling people in the Net,
it will be because of people accepting to become prostituted.
I am not a petty nationalist, but where I come from, after such an
expulsion a lot of people would unsubscribe, and the issue would appear
in the daily newspapers (several pages of which every week are devoted
to Internet news and activities).
Pity I'm too busy nowadays (in dictionary software production). I would
gladly write articles on Dimitri's expulsion and the facade of Free
Speech in mailing lists etc., as I occasionally have written articles
as a part-time journalist.
Believe me, the nature of the (cypherpunks) list as well as the
importance of the person expelled (at one time I wanted to interview
Dimitri for other things he exposed), makes VERY HOT NEWS indeed.
But since I have no time, it's likely someone else will report this.
What we're REALLY interested in, is exposing fallacies about
Freedom of Speech when "private mailing lists" are the biggest threat
to it, nowadays, ever since the Net was invented.
I will pass this on to relevant people and see what happens.

Quite true, and the same thing I was told by the Chief-Editor
of "Info" (the weekly Internet-supplement of a prominent Greek
journal -Eleftherotypia).
One last comment is important here:
If the 'neo-liberal' ideology of EVERYTHING becoming 'privatised'
succeeds, then non-governmental censorship is MUCH more important
the governmental censorship.
The Internet is a threat to the 'traditional' role of the media,
and 'list-owners' try tp behave like patronising conventional
newspaper-editors. All the filth that was hidden in the closet
of the journalistic profession comes out, as a result, in the
Net. These people want to _model_ mailing lists after journals
-ironically at a time when many journalists are free to write
what they like sometimes against the opinions of the journal-owners.
Perhaps our only hope is that... Freedom sells.

@_subject: Re: Censor John Gilmore -- EFF is a disgrace! 
In this case, I'd quote a poet who said
"I am not sorry for the poets who were left without an audience,
 I am sorry for the audiences who were left without any poets".
I would suggest that it is not at all a "safe" indication of personal
or intellectual _worth_, (of Mr. Boursy or of anyone) "how many
accounts he has lost".
For two reasons:
(1)  As I read Mr. Boursy's postings, I see no indication that he is
     either deranged, or evil, or lacking sanity or maturity. If he
     had these qualities, they'd sooner or later show up inside the F-K
     list, to which I subscribe for several months (nearly a year?).
(2)  The situation inside the "less official" side of thje Internet,
     at the moment (aka mailing lists) is so notoriously repressive
     that perhaps a _minority_ of mailing lists do not indulge in
     so-called "forcible unsubscriptions". E.g. what about the "Orgonomy
     mailing list" kicked out an eloquent critic of its owner (Dr.
     Demeo) (can find all names and details if you like) just because
     he opposed Dr. Demeo's "experiments" in an Israeli desert which
     (allegedly, according to the critic) resulted in people's deaths.
     I mention this case, because I was present there, and because
     (just like the "Cypherpunks" list) it was directly or indirectly
     related to issues of Freedom ("Orgonomy" being the "Alternative
     Psychology" of a rather unconventional thinker called Wilhelm Reich
     who died in an American jail after the McCarthian State framed him).
It is not ethical to send such strong negative _injunctions_ to masses
of people and also to strangers (the 1900-strong members of the cyberphunks
list for instance). Because, you may or may not have strong reasons for
believing you are justified in such invalidation, but more than a 1000
people are now _told_ by (self-appointed) "experts" such as yourself what
and whom to ignore or to believe. (Like sheep led to the slaughter)...
This was my objection also inside the F-K list, for _some_ of the postings
in the past, but none of these postings was connected with acts of
censorship, or with "sweeping generalisations" without evidence. On several
occasions that I searched and found who or what they were talking about,
I discovered they were talking about people whose activities were indeed
horrifying (forged cancellations etc) and who also fought back.
But what you are doing now, extending the "1-person-blacklist" to your
number-two-entry (Mr. Boursy) is exactly the thing that I hoped you might
        First they kicked out Dimitri Vulis.
        Then they slandered and kept out Steve Boursy.

Boy oh boy!!!! :-) Financial Gain being "too much work"??? :-)
Hey dude, I work for myself, you know. Ever since childhood, I learned
how not to rely on ANYBODY.
I experienced no "favors" nor "incentives" whatsoever, all my life.
The taxation here is designed to drain the blood of all SMALL businesses
(like mine) and favor the big businesses.
There is very poor welfare here, too. America is almost... socialist
in some respects compared to the Greek welfare state.
Your 'model' of what's going on is more appropriate for the Russians
and the Eastern Block (former) dictatorships, in which case I agree! :-)
The free market is the _precondition_ for free speech. But Free speech
does NOT necessarily follow from it. What happened in GREECE and CHILE
in fact is a living proof of this: Such countries had ENTIRELY free
market and NO FREE SPEECH. This is right-wing fascism, as you know.
I hope you agree with these clarifications. I don't see why not...
The 'all-knowing' dictators of Chile (installed by US involvement)
gave NO money to ANYBODY (but big businesses and American corporations).
As for the Nicaraguan case, the scandal of the C.I.A. financing the
contras using drug-money from selling drugs to American Blacks has
been thoroughly exposed in the rest of the world.
The only 'all-knowing' philanthropists around the world have been
the Stalinist lunatics who are nowdays replaced by (more 'professional'

 only a secondary role in your politics). :-)
We never run out of saliva spitting on the face of the (Greek) state

This is a big discussion. The free market _is_ the only way. I agree.
However, as I explained in another (private and humourous) posting,
for instance, I am a winter-swimmer, and use the facilities of a beach
run and owned by the State here in Greece, which will probably CLOSE
DOWN, as soon as it is privatised. At the moment, it's a gift to us
-10 or 20 'winter-swimmers' operating at a loss, not a profit. One
must be on guard for extreme views, neo-liberal or otherwise)... :-)
I am in solidarity with your worries, and in favour of both.
But... Sometimes one does not 'automatically' imply the other.
How much should I be charged for every word I utter?  In 1990 I was being
PAID for every word I wrote. Not so anymore! :-) :-)
At least you could afford (as the English say)... 1 penny for these
thoughts! ROTFL!!!! :-)
Me? I voluntarily waste my time, dude, to write my opinions for free! :-)
It's the last thing I do for free, after some rare friendships
and other rare precious things in life.  Don't we al have such things? :-)
If we don't write _some_ opinions for free we'd all become... whores
waiting for the next pimp to exercise 'list-owner's rights on our speech.
Or get bribed to tell lies, and so on! :-) :-)
Perhaps my clarifications helped.
In Logic, Complete Systems are Consistent, and Consistent Systems
are Incomplete. Thus, 'extreme views' of any kind are impractical.

A little while ago, I received Spam from the same source an 8th time.

George A. Stathis
P.S. If you take a deep breath, see my (amusing?) comments in the end. :)
Well, first of all, Tim May is doing a disservice to the companies who use
his services. They will end up hiring only morons and controllable relics
of human creativity;  Which is why there a WORLD-SHORTAGE of SUPER-
PROGRAMMERS at the moment, as reported e.g. by Byte-magazine.
If I were a _clever_ American employer, I'd use Tim's 'black list', in
order to HIRE precisely those people whom he considers 'unemployable'... Now I don't want to boast about who I am, but it's strangely ironical
that I _am_ one such "Super-Programmer" (fluent in PROLOG. Assembly, 'C'
and also... English -a computer-lingo as it happens). In the eighties I
was also a painter (of pictures, not walls), and other things...
As a 'New Age' kind of person, I used to admire America for rewarding and
promoting human _talent_, as opposed to human mediocrity, subservience
(the "Yes-Man" attitude), and Evil in the Soul. (as often happened in
old-whore Europe; especially in Greece)... :-)
Nowadays, however, when 'people' like Tim May, are able to dictate to your
admirable High-Technology firms, *what* kind of people to hire and what not
to hire, I can see... very gloomy prospects for American Research, _if_
this type of monstrocity (as his letter) is prevails for too long... :-)
Originally, lists of "unemployable" people, which I had heard of, crossed
my mind as 'probably justified'. As an EMPLOYER MYSELF, with a small but
strong software-house, here in Athens, with at least one important Market Success, I do have some experience, you know, of what kind of people *are*
and what kind of people are *not* 'employable'. I once knew a very good but
very egotistic Assembly Language programmer. When he stopped working with
me he stole large sections of my source-code. As a result, I find it hard
to trust 'employees' ever since...
I would therefore request a list of 'unemployable' people in order to choose
possible collaborators, in my work. They should be highly proficient in
PROLOG code, as well as ASSEMBLY and 'C', and should also be sociable, witty
and independent-minded.  Clashing with personalities like Tim May's may be
considered an added advantage.
Just for the record, I spoke on the phone with an important partner, told
him what happened, and was told by him that Tim May's letter is the kind
of scum-fascism no serious European Company would ever give credit to...
However, Tim's letter appears not so much to address me personally, as much
as the hordes of gullible, insecure, employment-hungry young Americans, who
are often _terrorised_ into complete SILENCE, since the _slightest_ amount
of free speech in their own natural (or Net-) surroundings, causes Fascist
PUnk-Thugs like TIm May to threaten them with unemployability.
Although Tim May's letter in itself constitutes terroristic harrasment,
threat to libery (via threat of unemployability), and so on, I consider these
labels to be irrelevant in this case, and legal arguments highly irrelevant.
When Nazi Germany deported Einstein it took much less elaborate procedures
than flawed 'unemployability lists'. Perhaps hiring Mafia men to finish us
off would be a much more efficient tactic in this respect. :-)
With Dismay, but also... Inspiration :-)

P.S. I also cross-posted this DELIBERATELY, this time to the cypherpunks

Well, I propose a solution to this problem: I don't mind paying fees in
fact, if the prices are reasonable. For instance THIS text was _paid_ for,
since I pay my Internet provider a certain amount of money every month.
It would be unthinkable, however, that my Internet Provider would mess
around with THIS text, or with ANY opinion of mine (I am sure you agree).
Now, a mailing list has _some_ similarities to the services of an
Internet provider, except (usually) the _cost_.  I am sure Mr. Gilmore
would be more than happy to be _paid_ for the (faulty) services he
provides (to his list-members), since e.g. 1900 members times $1 per
2 months (shall we say) would earn him (shall we say) 950 dollars a
month; Not much perhaps in some countries, but enough in most places
as compensation for the services he provides.
The problem with Mr. Gilmore (apart from being an asshole) is really
that he is rather a thick-minded proponent of censorship of his list's
'eccentric' members, that such subtleties don't even cross his mind.

Senator McCarthy managed to terrorize the entire U.S.A. some decades

@_subject: Re: Censor John Gilmore -- EFF is a disgrace! 
Dear "Info",
Mr. Stephen Boursy has made a number of important revelations here.
I went back and read nearly all his posts, and I will say this _again_,
I have found NOTHING to suggest a lack of reliability in what he says.
I am in no way affiliated to Mr. Boursy. I have never seen his face, even.
In fact I had hardly noticed Mr. Boursy's presence till only a few days
ago, when the forcible expulsion of Russian Mathematician Dimitri Vulis
from the "cypherpunks" list fell like a bomb over my naive gullible head.
Only AFTER this, I started reading ALL the previous postings that I had
missed (about 60-70 % of them).
I decided to find out what's happening.
I saw OBVIOUS things, and OBVIOUS LIES, since as a lurker who kept
ALL previous postings (in the Freedom-Knights list and elsewhere) I could
COMPARE my archives to what people claimed.  More often than not, to
my amazement, what a LOT of people claimed were packs of lies. And against
Mr. Boursy and Mr. Dimitri Vulis in particular, entire SEWAGES of lies.
So I forward this info to... "INFO", the Weekly Net-Supplement of
"Eleftherotypia", Greece's largest and most democratic newspaper.
The Greek public are rather well informed on the "shiny" side of the
Internet. But (the director of "Info" and I) have met and discussed,
on two occasions, a few months ago,  ALSO the "DARK" side....
Our only problem, is VOLUME. It's like trying to clean up a shit-hole
which has spilled the shit even outside itself, in the garden... :-)

                  ^^^^  ^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^^
I understand you completely here. I sympathize.
You sound honest and down to earth. I like these qualities very much.
Does your "unemployment list" include Doctor Dimitri Vulis? I'd be greatful
to know this.
Please, seriously now, and if you have such evidence (that
Dimitri is 'lazy', 'stupid' or 'dishonest') send to me if you can...
Please provide _evidence_ for his 'fame'. I will have NO MORE slander behind
the guy's back. WHAT is going on? I've been harrassed and threatended TOO,
just because of defending him or supporting people's rights to a fair trial?
WHERE do you live, dude? In Nazi Germany? :-(
I have no disagreement with your down-to-earth explanations. But...
Sooner or later your 'sheep-leader' Mr. Gilmore will start blocking access
to MORE geniouses (other than Voulis, who I think _could_ be one) to your
list, and then encryption will be entrusted to morons who can at ANY moment
have their coding systems BROKEN!!!
Perhaps you misunderstood my objections to your practises. FROM the moment
that (for instance) people EVEN like myself receive notices (or threats of)
unemployability (as indeed happened in the letter quoted below) it's an
alarming sign that the _criteria_ for unemployability are no longer your
own decent down-to-earth criteria (honesty, intelligence, trust-worthiness)
but very dark and dubious and QUITE FASCIST criteria instead.
It's only recently that the type of fascist harrassment like "We'll put
you on our U-list", has reached such ABUSE, MISUSE, and ALARMING FREQUENCY.
For some people it's become bread and butter and cheese, apparently...
I would say you are a decent, honest, fearless man trying to do a job which
has a LOT of responsibility, and you may be one among a HUNDRED morons who
by adding NAMES in 'unemployability' lists are no fucking different than
TRAITORS of your country and Nazi Sympathizer in Western Europe.
YOU get back to reality and defend your country from fascism (NOt you
personally, because you had the decency and the honesty to reply), the
OTHERS must get back to reality.
BACK-STABBING and SLANDER (of Dimitri or of anyone) has NOTHING to do
with _serious_ issues of 'unemployability'., FURTHERMORE people are NEVER
guilty before PROVEN so. Guilt or Innocence is NOT a matter of 'opinion',
EITHER of 'mobs' OR of 'leaders', or of would-be psychiatrists roaming
the streets looking for 'juvenile kooks', or other types of labels.
You are, most probably, a real person with very real responsibilites.
In this case, I appreciate you a lot, and hopefully my complaints have

First of all, I question your right to have 'authority', not only for this,

BECAUSE you are NOT a "cypherpunk". You are a CypherScumBag-Fascist.
People sent me PRIVATE letters asking how to converse in encrypted E-mail

of everybody NOW, because it took me a fucking long time NOT to need to
remain SILENT in front of FASCIST ASSHOLES LIKE you. DIE, Scum!
Well, my friends and I have been compiling OPEN lists of *Fascist Scum*,

For example in _my_ island of Kythera (birthplace of Goddess Venus) where
I also have a house, often relaxing there to flee the 'rat-race' madness.
(whenever I can steal some time from running my _own_ business in Athens).
In any case...
Congratulations, Master Tim, you've earned yourself the No[1] place in our
own... _legal_ blacklist of Fascist Scum who are Undesirables in... Greek
Islands. If you ever come to Greece we'll *ruin* your holidays... :-)
(seriously now...)
"Unemployability lists" are *illegal* in _Europe_ anyway, you know.
They are specifically illegal in the "Human Rights and Protection of
Private Records of Information" Acts, of the EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT...
The only _legal_ 'unemployability files' in _Europe_ are those involving
penal convictions, as well as _true_ records of previous employment. And
if someone can _prove_ in a European court that someone else's slanderous
activity ruined their prospects of employment, you go to jail, poor Tim...
In Europe, freedom of opinion and style of self-expression OUTSIDE WORK,
are irrelevant, actually.. Even inside a company they're relevant if and
only if they damage the profits or the reputation or other company assets.
(And good programmers are tolerated for being wild eccentrics, _anyway_).
This is *nothing*, compared to what _will_ happen in a few years time,
when SUCH so-called 'UNEMPLOYABLE PERSONS FILES' are gonna be taken to
Publicity and also to (European) Justice. We'll convict you to pay such
a great FINE for malicious harm to individuals all over the world, that
you will CRAWL inside a hole somewhere in your United States and never,
ever, ever, attempt to leave the shitty polluted hole of yours anymore.
You will be screaming for help from the ACLU, and hiring bodyguards! :-).
Of course, _Mafia-like Fascist McCarthian Scum_ like yourself laugh with
'human rights laws'... (Especially European Laws)...
So, if THIS didn't scare ya, there is MORE for you AT HOME:
The hordes of U.S. University Graduates, left unemployed by the year 2005
or 2010, will LITERALLY FRY YA alive, scumbag Tim, chop off your head and
pin it on a lamp-post, IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY, because they'd be *very* angry
with fascist scum like you, undermining their (already widespread) serious
unemployment, which is likely to cause many deaths in RIOTS and TURMOIL...
As for me... :-)
I imagine myself waking up in my Greek island house one day, reading the
NEWS: "Lynch Mob in the States torture and murder controversial holders
of 'unemployability lists', blaming them for their own unemployment"; Wow!
And as I sip my (100% _real_) orange juice with cheerful REAL people, in
a beach-bar near my island-house, I will sigh; starting to tell my friends
a story(!) about WHAT this strange news is about, and WHO was this Fascist
American "Tim May", murdered by mobs of angry young American unemployed...
(MY CONDOLENCES).
In fact...
Long before THIS day is over, poor old Tim, you will start having REAL
nightmares at night:
Because NOBODY can protect you, NOW, when you crawl YOUR streets at night; streets already UNSAFE, you know. And THIS lack of safety is part of your
DEPLORABLE standard of living over there: NOT the money; what money BUYS!
Don't *ever* threaten again ANY European, with your "U-lists", especially
Europeans who have their OWN businesses, and who can also write _much_
better software code (in 'PROLOG' & 'Assembler') than you, dumb-old-Tim!
You are ALREADY obsolete, disposable, pseudo-human NOISE; Trash from your
own past, when Senator McCarthy's 'unemployability threats' sent the U.S.
back to the Middle Ages. You are welcome to get BACK to those Middle Ages,
if you like; So as to follow the drain-pipe-highway of OTHERS like you...
