Can I just add a loud HURRAH! on the integration of PGP and Pegasus using the PGPJN add-on. It is by far the smoothest melding of PGP and a e-mail routine to date. The only way it would be smoother is on one program. THe learning curve is also negligible. For all those griping about no good PGP windoze e-mail programs, your wait is over. This mail program won over a die hard Eudora fan in about 15 minutes... Someone else already posted the sites to get this so forgive my laziness of not repeating their words.
Oh, did I mention this is seamless under Windoze 95 as well?
