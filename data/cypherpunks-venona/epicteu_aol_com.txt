VB 32 Bit Coders
I am trying to start a VB 32 bit code bank you can send any code you want to
exept codes for aol addons...  . 1nce a week most likely on fridays I will
check the hotmail account specifyed below and I will take all the codes and
put them in a txt file and send it to everyone who sent a code in since I am
working on a project useing winsock and Inet controls as alot of you may have
noticed I will be posting alot of Code for those two controls. How to Send:
To send Codes for the ML Send E-mail to VB32Coders In the sbject field write anonymous / Code topic if you don't want your E-Mail
address to show up when I send the Codes out or else just type the topic of
the code you are sending.. .
Next Issue:
I will be sending out the next code list on the 21st of this month So anyone
tha wants to be on this list has about a week to send in codes
