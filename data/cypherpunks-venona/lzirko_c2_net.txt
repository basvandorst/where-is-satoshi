I just got 17 more in the last 30 minutes.  They appear to match messages delivered already as per sender, subject and time.  The only common issue I see it toad.  I have copied a set below.

I have seen delivery receipts for messages use a similar format and since these are duplicates of full messages received earlier there is a probability that sendmail is misconfigured on littlefoot ( or whatever the box at mcom is ).

This is the same company that made the claim earlier on this list to "break our code and own the company for $1".  It definately generated a lot of comments then, I think about six months ago.  They changed their name to IPG midway through the process.  This should be in the archives.  Sorry about the late response to this but I have been unavailable for the last four days working on a project and am just beginning to catch up on sleep and mail.
