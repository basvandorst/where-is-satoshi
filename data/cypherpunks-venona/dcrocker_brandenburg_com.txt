As the Mitnick experience shows, the vulnerability of the
providers' host systems is a concern not addressed by link-oriented schemes
such as SSL.  Longer keys for SSL would not have improved the protection on
the 30,000 credit card numbers he stole.

@_subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: IMC Resolving Security Complexity Workshop 
These are the final arrangements:
        Resolving Email Security Complexity Workshop
            21 February 1996 * 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM
      San Jose (CA) Hilton & Towers  *  San Carlos Room
                 (next to Convention Center)
 Pre-registration & payment: $50  *  After February 16: $75
 (cash, check, wire transfer, money order, or First Virtual)
     Pass this note on to others who are deeply involved in
     email security.
                           AGENDA
The meeting will be structured with a tight agenda, having a
very focused sequence of work; it is definitely not for
general education. Some amount of review is appropriate, but
not much. The following agenda is tentative and will be
reviewed and modified on the pre-workshop discussion list.
*    Very briefly describe the MOSS, PGP, and S/MIME
     solutions
*    Review the functional and technical concerns
*    Review the extent to which each alternative satisfies
     the concerns
*    Seek consensus for concerns that qualify as
     requirements
*    Haggle about the strengths and weaknesses of the
     technical alternatives
*    Explore the choices and/or negotiate a preferred
     solution

cypherpunks might also be an interesting -- or even better -- venue for
raising the question.  Sorry for the duplicates if you get them.  d/)
If this has shown up in one or another of the discussion threads already, I
apologize for missing it.
occurs to me that the confirmation message sent from First Virtual back to
the (purported) purchases is, itself, pretty distinctive.  It makes me
wonder whether an attack of the style used to detect credit card typing on
the keyboard could not also be used to detect the arrival of the FV
confirmation query and then, of course, to automatically generate a 'yes'
response back to FV?
permits essentially any and all activities to be suborned.  Only a smart
card mechanism stands a chance of standing up to this, but that, in effect,
makes the smart card the 'user machine'.

While the differential is small, the real concern is that we have a
reasonable estimate of the number of attendees.  If you plan to attend and

@_subject: Re: PGP... 
Responses you've gotten have foccussed on defining public versus private
key.  Some have cited how they are used, but I'd like to emphasize this:
Message authentication:
  Make a "hash" of the message, i.e., compute a short, unique tag of the
message.  (A common algorithm for this is MD5.)  Then "encrypt" the hash
using the SENDER's private key.  Anyone wishing to authenticate the message
uses the SENDER's public key to "decrypt" the hash and check it against the
message receive (i.e., recompute a new hash and compare it to the received
Message privacy:
  Encrypt the message data.  (A common algorithm is DES or, more recently,
triple DES.  PGP uses IDEA.)  To get acceptable performance, encryption is
done using a symmetric key algorithm, rather than a much slower asymmetric
(public) key algorithm.  Then "encrypt" the symmetric key using the
RECEIVER's public key.  The RECEIVER uses their private key to decrypt the
symmetric key and then uses the symmetric key to decrypt the data.

it's just fine to make a point of never responding to any mail from someone
you happen to consider a fool.  If enough list participants happen to
concur with your assessment, a de facto state of ostracism results.
