@_subject: Cryptology and knot theory? 
I've finally got the time to read "Cyphernomicon", and in chapter 5 (Cryptology) and 17 (The Future) I found this, which I think looks interesting, since I'm interested in computational topology.
    5.5.9. Miscellaneous Abstract Ideas
             [...stuff deleted...]
             - links to knot theory
    17.10.3. Ciphers are somewhat like knots...the right sequence of moves
             unties them, the wrong sequence only makes them more tangled.              ("Knot theory" is becoming a hot topic in math and physics
             (work of Vaughn Jones, string theory, etc.) and I suspect
             there are some links between knot theory and crypto.)
Has any work been done along those lines?
I did some searches with AltaVista, but I only found Cyphernomicon...

Well...  I think the theory has become much more interesting after the classification, because we know that our problem _can_ be solved,
and our only problem is to do it faster and to get a better understanding
for the subject (there are lots of conjectures which seems simple, but whose state is unknown.)
I agree that it doesn't look good (since most of our invariants are NP-hard)
but the vassiliev invariants might be used to approximate the other
invariants... (I do not know what has been done in such approximation
theory the last couple of years.)
