@_subject: brief review of MIT 12/15/95 "micro-commerce" talks 
This is a quick summary of the Friday 12/15/95 talks at MIT on
Millicent	--- Mark Manasse, Digital Equipment Corporation
PayWord		--- Ron Rivest, MIT
MicroMint	--- Adi Shamir
Lightweight Signatures for Revocation	--- Silvio Micali, MIT
Overall, the PayWord scheme is probably the one to watch for actual use
on the Internet.  Millicent has an advantage of not using PKC, but
PayWord may be simpler to implement and is being discussed in the WWW
Consortiom and the IETF as a possible draft standard.  It is also worth
noting that PayWord operates essentially by combining a
PKC-signature-based authentication (between user and broker) with a
One-Time-Password (OTP) authentication scheme (as in the S/Key system).
OTP has been getting standardized recently on the Internet and maybe
that will help too.
