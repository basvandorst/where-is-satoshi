I'm aware of the three main disk encryption programs SFS, SECDRV, and
SECDEV, but I need to find a solution that works with Windows 95 32bit
or Windows NT 4.0.
I'm currently using SFS 1.17 and Secure Drive under Win-95, but am
unable to continue to work in dos compatability mode due to severe
performance hits.  I am open to commercial products that have passed
peer review, but know of none.
If anyone could suggest a solution (outside of switching OS's), I
would be *most* gratefull.
Please respond to the list, as I am a subscriber under another

I may have to consider this approach. I'll have to look into Ian's system.
Does it pass muster with the crypto gods? (that's meant as a compliment
guys :)

I have actually had Secure File System, Secure Drive, and Secure Device
all installed with mounted volumes at the same time under Win95.  However,
32bit file access is not the problem.  When you load a TSR in Win95, the
operating system forces you into 16bit DOS compatability mode.  I'm not a
kernal guru so I can't explain all the specifics, but it basically makes
95 act as Win-3.11 and looses multithreading (as it were) and creates
serious memory paging problems if you have >32mb installed.
Thanks for the reply though .. and if you need assitance with getting
SECDEV working under 95, just drop me a note.
