@_subject: Re: PA Remailer Concerns 
may have had other concerns regarding phone abuse, e.g., long distance fraud.  Doesn't necessarily matter what the legislative history was.  When some
prosecutor trying to make a name for himself hooks onto this language to
prosecute an anonymous remailer or other perceived miscreant, nobody will
remember what the intent was.  The casebooks are full of perversions of
original intent.
