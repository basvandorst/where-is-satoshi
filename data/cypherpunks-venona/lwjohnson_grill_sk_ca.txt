For what it's worth, I think that this Tim May, not being a
user of the list, has no place to talk. His type, to me,
characterate those who quit something and complain later,
knowing that some people will listen to them.
So what, if he decided to leave? It was his own choice
and he can't just come back and say everyone who stayed is
now impelled to listen to him, just because he used to
do a bunch of posts. I don't think that hardly any of
you would listened to me later if I left the list.

Because the guy who wrote it was let off after that on his jail charges, so I'm not going to use anything he made after that if
I don't know why.
I'm not saying that he rolled over or nothin buyt I'm gonna be
paranoyd like he said in the book. I dont suposse he'd mind,
since he said it.
I'm not real smart sometimes but I'nm not a real lamer, either.

Yeah their real cute, most of them anyway. Their all nice though. Some of them
would like you cause they dont like regular guys, cause their troublemakers
too. I know your a troublemaker (I think thats a good thing) because Ive read your
stuff and myu uncle keeps you in his NotADork/MyAssholes dir. Thats where he keeps the troublemakers but its not an insult because he likes what Kevin
(hes a Bodston Celtic said--"Danny Ange is an asshole, but hes _our_ asshole."
  He taght me how to read by using the Froggie manual since I could boot it
myself when he was out of the rooom when I was two year old. Now he teachs
me how to read with the cypherpunk messages and stuff from his govbernment
friends. (Their good government guys though, they like you guys. Their really secret guys not lamer regualar secret guys. They laugh at those regular secret guys who screw with you guys cause they leave their pecker
tracks all over the place.)
Some people thik Im a lamer cause Im not good with grammer (not on the kids
lists thogh) bu tmy uncle says Ill learn how to do that but Im better to
learn how tho think first. Ive got dsylexia too so I use a spell checkerif
I want to look smart but emailers dont have it.
You guyhs should keep being troublemakers. Really.
My uncle says that if you guys get too polite then you better watcvh your
backs when you curtsy, cause you never know whos sneaking up behind you.
He told me that if I watch you rmodernation that I wont have to have
sex educaton laterer cause I'll already know how to get f*)&%ed.
(Hes funny. His governmnt friends call him the fool becaise hes dumb like
a fox.)
Excuse my spelling but I spell things good once I see them in a dir cause
myu uncle make s me look stuff up before I put it in a dir or he erases
myu dir to make me learn.
I think the girls would like you cause yuou are a computer guy. Ill show them your letter. Theeir smart, too. They dont like lamer guys. When their
school computer guy messes up ecveyones stuff then they fix it but they dont tell him cause it makes him mad.
Im not real good at 4reading code and stuff but the secret computer guys let me drink Scotch with them evcen in the bar at the Holiday In in Santafe
cause Im smarter than them abou t som e stuff even if they are really good.
(I go tm y uncles password on his secret machine by putting my video camera
on the frige with a dead battery and pluging it into his power supply)
(Now when he boots up he will getr Duke Nukem3D and when he leacves it
he will get a message telling him hes a _lamer_.)
He had to go to Lost Alamo again because of you guys and hell gibve me sh*&)( when he gets back but not too much cause he said I could do anything I want on his secret machine if I got on it.
Im getting to play with Unix cause he has a Spark Card on it that has Unix
on it. (Dos is for lamers but Bill Gates owns ecerything so its cheaper
for kids)
Some lamer said on cypherpunks today that it takes him an hour to get
the pecker messages off his computer. My uncle has me to do it for him
sometimes and it only take me like maybve two minutes. If the guy is such a lmaer that it take s hinm an hour then maybe he
should just read only the pecker messages cause they have pictures and
then when he mobes his lips to read then he coul d put them on the
peckers. (Thats a joke)
I like that Tim May is bacvk, if only even for a little while.  When you
guys fight at least you say stuff that isnt kissing ass for other guys Im going to make a message to cypherpunsk that says if anyone wants me
to be their moderator then they should not write any messages to the
cypherpunks. Then the 2000 people who dont post will be voting for me
to be their moderator and I will be their boss.
If Im the moderator then I will givbe everyone free pizz a and lots and lots of Scotch. (<--Dewars)
I hope you guys stay together. My uncle says sometimes you learn by looking and sometimes you leran by seeing whos looking back. But he
tells the  secret gobvernmetn guys not to look back cause their
might be a cypherpunk gaining on them. (Thats a joke)
Ive got to go to bed so I can pretned to get up again. Im sick so I
can do what I want bu t Im not supposed to stya up all night either.
I wont let the door hit me in the ass on my wayout.

p.s. - dont write me after Thursday cause my dad will be back and Ill

I havent chosen nothing like that. I read all the stuff from all the messages from before modernation and since then and nobody got to choose nothing. You told them what
they were going to gwet and thats what they got.
Anybody that made it plain that they werent happy got thrown in the
trashcan and labled as being a flamer.
1311 addresses that you stole for your censored list.
Nobvody subscribved to cypherpunks-censored. You put them there cause
its you decided it was your list an dyou could put people where you
wanted even if they didnt like it.
My uncle calls it the cyperpunks-Auschwitz list. Thats what subdir
he keeps it in in his Dorks dir.
I could use it before and Im just a kid but Im not a lamer. Maybe you should call the list you stole cypherpunks-lamers. I know you are or else you wouldna thrown cypherpunks honest and
truthful feelings in the flames-crapper.
I read a lot of flamessages which people put a lot of their thouhgts into bu t they were emotional cause people get like that when someone
doo-doos on them.
You dont make any signal/noise at all since you dont even send messages
to the list. (except when you want tell bs about how people "chose"
Sandy to be their dictator when they didnt)
Not necessary either if your a dictator.
Howcum reading the list is a wast eof your time but making decisions
for ecveryone on the cypherpunks isnt?
1311 ofg them?
Howcum you just stole all of the list people for your censored list?
I think that was real stupid unless you just didnt care if people would know that your were stealing the list for yourself. It was
really rotten to call pewople flamers just cause they complained.
Thats what those GAK guys are for and all those secret govbernment
guys that want there not to be a cypherpunks anymore.
No you already done too much.
I will. Im just a kid but I cant do any worse than already.
Im a kid so I get told to shut up all the time but I dont.
What do you mean _we_ white man? (thats a joke)
You havent talked about nothing on the list except how your not a
bad guy for pushing people areound into the lists where you want
them whether they like it or not.
You stole my uncles subsribing to the cypherpunks list and made him
a censored person. He had to break out to go to the uncensored list.
I think your a lamer.

I would:>

Sic lawyers and persecutors on a guy if he made some secret-keeping

Make my own secret software stuff using guys who want to make a lot
of money and will do what I want if I make it so they will.
Make businesses lose money unless they used my own secret software

Make a secret guy coup on troublemakers and take over their stuff

to tell everyone to use just my own secret-keeping software stuff.
I would make a secret guy coup on a mailing list if it was causing
trouble for me. I wouldnt do it until I had my own secret stuff ready to give to everyone though. And I would have my other secret
guys already on the list waiting for me to tell them what to do.
I would cause a lot of trouble on the list and use it to get rid of
the troublemaker guys and make everyone think that I am a good guy
saving them from bad guys wearing black hats and shooting at them
with penis-pictures.
I would let another guy be a dumb guy and do all the bad things
for me on the list so everyone would be mad at him and not at me.
I would let my secret smart guys on the list tell everyone that
the dumb guy wasnt doing dumb and bad things. I would make them

If I was a secret government guy I would make a cypherpunks home
page and fix it so that anyone who used the "legendary and massive
directory of global Internet resources" (a fancy name for a bunch
of Yahoos) to search for cypherpunks would only find my home page and the home pages of two crazy guys.
My home page wouldnt have any links to other peoples cypherpunks
mail list stuff but only the one my secret guys were taking over.
I would hope nobody would notice that almost everyone in the world who searches for the cypherpunks would only find the mailing list that is censored by my guy and my autobot.
I would hope that nobody would notice that the guy saying hes checking to see if secret government guys are messing with the
cypherpunks is one of my guys.
Of course Im just a kid and not a secret government guy so I cant
do all this stuff. Good thing for you guys, huh?
(But you guys should watch out for messages that start with saying,
"You are getting sleepy...you are getting very very sleepy...)
Anyway my uncle is kicking me off of cypherpunks so he can clean up
my mess in my dads email before he gets home. And then hes going
to kill me (but only after I help him find the silver key on the
second level of Duke Nukem3D--hes a gamer-lamer).
You guys might think Im a lamer myself but I got my Sandy flame on
the censored list (on my very first message) using kindegarten cryptography and you didnt so maybe you could learn something
from a kid, huh?
My uncle says he doesnt think kids (or anybody else) should have
what they say thrown in the flames-crapper just because someone
doesnt like what they say.
He used to go behind the Iron Curtain so people could hear what
other people didnt want them to hear and now he goes behind the
ElectroMagnetic Curtain instead and he says he wont let any lamers shut me up just because their ashamed of what their doing
and dont want anyone to know about it.
He helped me with some of this but only to not sound like a real lamer (just a bit of a lamer) but not with what I think
about the cypherpunks. I learned how to read with the Froggie
manual and cypherpunks messages and government stuff and stuff
by my dead uncle who is dead because of what he wrote about
the guys who started the internet in the first place. (Their not
good guys.)
I like you guys. Dont bend over for the lamers.
Dont start to cry.
Just keep on being flamers.
   Bitch and shout.
   Dont worry about the schisms.
   And dont let the Fascists take
   Your algorithms.
Lamers come and go
So dont worry bout their junk
Anarchists have  keys
They're Immortal CypherPunks.

Of course Im just a kid and not a secret government guy so I cant
do all this stuff. Good thing for you guys, huh?
(But you guys should watch out for messages that start with saying,
"You are getting sleepy...you are getting very very sleepy...)
Anyway my uncle is kicking me off of cypherpunks so he can clean up
my mess in my dads email before he gets home. And then hes going
to kill me (but only after I help him find the silver key on the
second level of Duke Nukem3D--hes a gamer-lamer).
You guys might think Im a lamer myself but I got my Sandy flame on
the censored list (on my very first message) using kindegarten cryptography and you didnt so maybe you could learn something
from a kid, huh?
My uncle says he doesnt think kids (or anybody else) should have
what they say thrown in the flames-crapper just because someone
doesnt like what they say.
He used to go behind the Iron Curtain so people could hear what
other people didnt want them to hear and now he goes behind the
ElectroMagnetic Curtain instead and he says he wont let any lamers shut me up just because their ashamed of what their doing
and dont want anyone to know about it.
He helped me with some of this but only to not sound like a real lamer (just a bit of a lamer) but not with what I think
about the cypherpunks. I learned how to read with the Froggie
manual and cypherpunks messages and government stuff and stuff
by my dead uncle who is dead because of what he wrote about
the guys who started the internet in the first place. (Their not
good guys.)
I like you guys. Dont bend over for the lamers.
Dont start to cry.
Just keep on being flamers.
   Bitch and shout.
   Dont worry about the schisms.
   And dont let the Fascists take
   Your algorithms.
Lamers come and go
So dont worry bout their junk
Anarchists have  keys
They're Immortal CypherPunks.
I have to go get killed now.

For what it's worth, I think that this Tim May, not being a
user of the list, has no place to talk. His type, to me,
characterate those who quit something and complain later,
knowing that some people will listen to them.
So what, if he decided to leave? It was his own choice
and he can't just come back and say everyone who stayed is
now impelled to listen to him, just because he used to
do a bunch of posts. I don't think that hardly any of
you would listened to me later if I left the list.

Because the guy who wrote it was let off after that on his jail charges, so I'm not going to use anything he made after that if
I don't know why.
I'm not saying that he rolled over or nothin buyt I'm gonna be
paranoyd like he said in the book. I dont suposse he'd mind,
since he said it.
I'm not real smart sometimes but I'nm not a real lamer, either.

Thats a good thing to say. I wonder howcom no one on this list figures
that all the cool things they say at the end should be thoght about
when it comes to what everyones doing on the list, with all the carp
and the like. (I maeant _crap_)
Everyone talks like their real smart, but I wonder if their not just
a bunch of lamers if they cant get their problems fixed without doing
all the stuff their mottos and stuff say not to do.
I'm on some lists run by kids and they don't tell anyone to shut up
but they still dont have to get all that stuff from the guys advrtising
because the kids running it know how to use their computers.
It sounds like a bunch of old guys on this list, since they don't
think someone should be called a dork when they _are_ one. If their
old then maybe they could ask their kids how to get rid of all the
lamer-stuff. But if they just want the other guys on the list to
shut up then their lamer-guys themselves, probablly7.
I guess all the Canadian guys are on the flame list, eh?, because
they're all hockey players.
I'm only on the list because I got a bunch of your mail that someone
put _fuck_you_ at the top, and when I tracked him down and gave him
hell, he used my internet guys to send bogus posts to you guys.
My uncle got on his machine and fixed it so it sends itself the Ping
of Death from a remailer. Hes been doing that for years, but only to
lamers who screw with him, otherwise he minds his own business.
Theres not many girls on this list, is there?
Do you spit or swallow? (Thats a joke---you dont have to answer)
Are you married?
I bet the guys on the list dont like it because you sound a whole lot
smarter than a lot of them. Old guys think that girls arent good with
computers, except for my uncle. He has to give a forteen year old girl on my list a hundred dollars because she got the Ping Of Death
past his firewall when his buddies at Lost Alamo New Mexico couldnt,
and their supposed to be experts because they belong to secret stuff
and some of them are cypherpunks, too, but they don't let anyone know
about it.
Anyway, myu ncle prints out the girl-cypherpunks stuff for the girls
on my list and they think its real cool and they all want to marry
technicians so that they can make them work on the computers for them,
kind of like making them do the computer dishes, you know.
I'm supossed to be in bed, but Im not, but I have to go.
My uncle is going to be mad when he finds out I'mn on cypherpunks
but the rule is that if I get on his secret machine I can do anything
I want to. When his machine boots Duke Nukem 3D is going to boot up
and he's going to be really m-bare-assed. He will shit when he finds
out I'm on cypherpunks list but it was because of him that the guy
started sending me all that junk from you so he cant say nothing.
(I hope!!!!)
He could whack those guys sending you penis drawings and stuff, because
he had his friends at Lost Alamo set up some remailers or get into them
or something to find out who it was, but hes not supposed to interfere
with your stuff but just watch and give people hints of stuff they
already know and stuff like that. He says you guys arent lamers (even
if you cant keep penis drawings off your machine) but just dont care
anymore about fixing your problems yourself.
I still think that you should just let your kids run your machine or
just pick the guy with the coolest name, like Attila the Hun or Genocide or OttOmatic.
I've got to go to bed really!
p.s. - My lists go t mail from fuck too but we didn't
_run_ his stuff, and were only kids. My uncle says you guys did.
(I wont call you guys a _lamer_ cause that would make me a _flamer_)  p.p.s. ->   It is morally as bad not to care whether a thing
(You guys should really read your own scrips at the end of your
messages sometimes and see if your doing it yourselfs)
Goodnight, you have a nice name and I bet your pretty too.

I didnt hear any rumor or anything. It just makes sense to me to be
paranoid like Mr. Zimmerman said.
Besides, my uncles friends write cryptagraphy for government guys
and big businesses and they mostly use 2.1 and 2.3 instead of the
stuff they write.
They say the code for the new stuff (PGP) is ok but there are too many funny-stuff programs being written that mess with it but that
nobody is bothering to write funny-stuff to mess with the old
versions. They say the same thing about their own stuff that they
are writing.
I cant read code real good, so i just listen to the best guys I know
to know how paraniod to be.
"No shit, Sherlock!"
Thats what we say on my lists when people say stuff that nobody should forget. I think a lot of the cypherpunks forgot the stuff
that they put at the end of their messages since they dont do it.
Thanks for writing me. Your polite and helpful.

My uncle says that sometimes (your last sentence). Maybe he got it from you?
He keeps your messages in a dir called NotADork. This is the one he keeps track the size of by bytes. He says that he keeps track of the size of his
Dorks dir by wieghing it on the bathroom scale.
(This is a compliment5 to you.)
I don't. I let _lamer_ be my watchword...
Everyones a lamer, sometimes. A "real lamer" is a lamer all the time.
Cypherpunks have some guys who talk real intelligent with a lot of words but
when you read it all, you can tell that their full-time lamers instead
of just ocassional ones.
Your hardly ever a lamer.

My uncle says I must be a cryptagrapher because I think in random
umbers. Then he laughs.
 If you are going to be that paranoid about things, you should not use
 anything you did not write yourself, afterall, even the cypherpunks  list could be an elaborate government scheme to lull people into using  PGP and similar technologies (JJ).
I dont write good code yet.
My uncle and his friends say that the government guys couldnt ever
do what they wanted with the cypherpunks because of the shit-disturbers
on the list but that the big business guys who want to own the list
to themselves will do what the government guys couldnt do.
(They ought to know cause some of them are the government guys who
watch the cypherpunks. I know cause they let me drink Scotch with
