Everyone is talking about the Clipper Chip, and lots of people are
wondering about the FBI's digital telephony initiative.  This talk
will discuss both of those things and provide some historical
perspective on the battle between Congress and the Administration over control of standards for civilian cryptography, and CPSR's
role in that debate.
Nelson Bolyard is an engineer for a major computer manufacturer in
the Silicon Valley.  He has background in cryptography and highly
secure systems, and is presently working in high-speed networking.

                      The Great Clipper Debate:
              National Security or National Surveillance?
Sponsored by:  The Georgetown University Law Center Space Law Group
               and Communications Law Forum
In Coordination with:    The George Washington University Institute for
Computer and Telecommunications Systems Policy, the Association for
Computing Machinery Special Interest Group for Computers and Society, and
the American Bar Association Criminal Justice Section.
Date and Time:    May 9, 1994, at 7:30 p.m.
Place:            The Georgetown University Law Center(Moot Court Room)
                  600 New Jersey Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
     The Administration, through the Department of Justice and the
National Security Agency, has proposed a standard encryption algorithm
for both the public and commercial marketplace, with the goal of making
this algorithm the method of choice for persons wishing to encode their
telephone and other voice and data communications.  The  FBI and the NSA
are concerned that the increasing availability, and affordability, of
encryption mechanisms will make it difficult and in some cases impossible
for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to tap into and to
understand the communications of criminals and other pertinent groups.
This proposal has become known as the "Clipper Chip,"  in that it would
be implemented by the voluntary insertion of a computer chip into
telephone, fax machine, and other communications systems.
     The Clipper Chip has generated considerable controversy.  Opposing
it are various civil libertarian groups, as well as telecommunications
companies, software and hardware manufacturers, and trade associations.
The debate has raged behind closed doors, and openly in the press.
     On Monday, May 9, at the Georgetown University Law School, a round
table debate will take place on this controversy.  The participants
represent both sides of the issue, and are illustrative of the various
groups which have taken a stand.  The participants are:
        Dorothy Denning, Chairperson of the Computer Science Department
        of Georgetown University
        Michael Godwin, Legal Counsel of the Electronic Frontier
        Foundation;
        Geoffrey Greiveldinger, Special Counsel to the Narcotic and
        Dangerous Drug Section of the U.S. Department of Justice;
        Michael Nelson, of the Office of Science and Technology Policy
        of the White House;
        Marc Rotenberg, Director of the Electronic Privacy Information
        Center; and
        Stephen Walker, President of Trusted Information Systems, Inc.,
        and a former cryptographer with the National Security Agency
     In addition, there will be two moderators:  Dr. Lance
Hoffman, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at The
George Washington University, and Andrew Grosso, a former federal
prosecutor who is now an attorney in private practice in the District of
     The program will last approximately two and one half hours, and will
be divided into two parts.  The first half will offer the panel the
opportunity to respond to questions which have been submitted to the
participants beforehand; the second will present the panel with questions
from the audience.
     There is no charge for this program, and members of the public are
encouraged to attend. Reservations are requested in advance, and should
be directed to one of the following individuals:

Hi folks,
You need to get software to see the MBone encapsulated packets. You will also need
a tunnel to your site (and you might already have one). So where to get the software...
I am looking for it on a ftp site but have not found it.
Some of the program names are Hey! I just heard from van Jacobson. He wrote alot of this software...
Content-Length: 218
The audio (vat), whiteboard (wb) & session directory (sd) tools
are on ftp.ee.lbl.gov in conferencing/{vat,wb,sd}/*.  The most
widely used video tool (nv) is available on parcftp.xerox.com
in pub/net-research.

Cygnus has a tunnel and so does Sun. I wish I could help more. I am still awaiting the PGP - Jeff broadcast. ps. If you do get it up, the session is "Cyberstation: audio feed"

I disagree. The MBone is here for us to use. Sessions do cost traffic
but not actual dollors to individuals who actually bring it up. You
may be limited by the connection you have to the Internet or by the
router you have that interconnects you to the Internet though, which will
determine what you can see and do on the MBone..
I also feel that such a message that I sent will be well received on the net. I doubt it's going to alienate folks. People are human and like alittle humor with the salt.
Sad news though. I just found out that the MBone sessions I brought
up are not seen outside of my site due to router setups.
But I will be able to do such things in the future and you can bet I
will. :)  Prehaps you would feel better if I didn't actually use the term cypherpunks as you feel it might represent the cypherpunks on this mailing
list. I think this is not so. Isn't that term a general one for folks
who like to work with encryption and are hackers?

I think you are not quite clear on how the MBone works. It uses the

in the since of retransmitting...
There are some WWW sites that have alot of MBone info which you might

-    Request for signatures for a letter to NSF opposing metered
     pricing of Internet usage
-    Please repost this request freely
The letter will be sent to Steve Wolff, the Director of
Networking and Communications for NSF.  The purpose of the letter
is to express a number of user concerns about the future of
Internet pricing.  NSF recently announced that is awarding five
key contracts to telephone companies to operate four Internet
"Network Access Points" (NAPs), and an NSF funded very high speed
backbone (vBNS).  There have been a number of indications that
the telephone companies operating the NAPs will seek permission
from NSF to price NAPs services according to some measure of
Internet usage.  The vBNS is expected to act as a testbed for new
Internet pricing and accounting schemes.  The letter expresses
the view that metered pricing of Internet usage should be
avoided, and that NSF should ensure that the free flow of
information through Internet listserves and file server sites is
preserved and enhanced.

Steve Wolff
Division of Networking and Communications
National Science Foundation
1800 G Street
Washington, DC  20550
Dear Steve:
It is our understanding that the National Science Foundation
(NSF) and other federal agencies are developing a new
architecture for the Internet that will utilize four new Network
Access Points (NAPs), which have been described as the new
"cloverleaves" for the Internet.  You have indicated that NSF is
awarding contracts for four NAPs, which will be operated by
telephone companies (Pac Bell, S.F.; Ameritech, Chicago; Sprint,
NY; and MFS, Washington, DC).  We further understand that NSF has
selected MCI to operate its new very high speed backbone (vBNS)
There is broad public interest in the outcome of the negotiations
between NSF and the companies that will operate the NAPs and
vBNS.  We are writing to ask that NSF consider the following
objectives in its negotiations with these five firms:
     PRICING.
We are concerned about the future pricing systems for Internet
access and usage.  Many users pay fixed rates for Internet
connections, often based upon the bandwidth of the connection,
and do not pay for network usage, such as the transfer of data
using email, ftp, Gopher or Mosaic.  It has been widely reported
on certain Internet discussion groups, such as com-priv, that the
operators of the NAPs are contemplating a system of usage based
We are very concerned about any movement toward usage based
pricing on the Internet, and we are particularly concerned about
the future of the Internet Listserves, which allow broad
democratic discourse on a wide range of issues.  We believe that
the continued existence and enhancement of the Internet
discussion groups and distribution lists is so important that any
pricing scheme for the NAPs that would endanger or restrict their
use should be rejected by the NSF.
It is important for NSF to recognize that the Internet is more
than a network for scientific researchers or commercial
transactions.  It represents the most important new effort to
expand democracy into a wide range of human endeavors.  The open
communication and the free flow of information have made
government and private organizations more accountable, and
allowed citizens to organize and debate the widest range of
matters.  Federal policy should be directed at expanding public
access to the Internet, and it should reject efforts to introduce
pricing schemes for Internet usage that would mimic commercial
telephone networks or expensive private network services such as
MCI mail.
To put this into perspective, NSF officials must consider how any
pricing mechanisms will change the economics of hosting an
Internet electronic mail discussion groups and distribution
lists.  Many of these discussion groups and lists are very large,
such as Humanist, GIS-L, CNI-Copyright, PACS-L, CPSR-Announce or
Com-Priv.  It is not unusual for a popular Internet discussion
group to have several thousand members, and send out more than
100,000 email messages per day.  These discussion groups and
distribution lists are the backbones of democratic discourse on
the Internet, and it is doubtful that they would survive if
metered pricing of electronic mail is introduced on the Internet.
Usage based pricing would also introduce a wide range of problems
regarding the use of ftp, gopher and mosaic servers, since it
conceivable that the persons who provide "free" information on
servers would be asked to pay the costs of "sending" data to
persons who request data.  This would vastly increase the costs
of operating a server site, and would likely eliminate many
sources of data now "published" for free.
We are also concerned about the types of  accounting mechanisms
which may be developed or deployed to facilitate usage based
pricing schemes., which raise a number of concerns about personal
privacy.  Few Internet users are anxious to see a new system of
"surveillance" that will allow the government or private data
vendors to monitor and track individual usage of Information
obtained from Internet listserves or fileserves.
     ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES
     We are also concerned about the potential for anti-
competitive behavior by the firms that operate the NAPs.  Since
1991 there have been a number of criticisms of ANS pricing
practices, and concerns about issues such as price discrimination
or preferential treatment are likely to become more important as
the firms operating the NAPs become competitors of firms that
must connect to the NAPs.  We are particularly concerned about
the announcements by PAC-Bell and Ameritech that they will enter
the retail market for Internet services, since both firms were
selected by NSF to operate NAPs.  It is essential that the
contracts signed by NSF include the strongest possible measures
to insure that the operators of the NAPs do not unfairly
discriminate against unaffiliated companies.
As the Internet moves from the realm of the research community to
a more vital part of the nation's information infrastructure, the
NSF must ensure that its decisions reflect the needs and values
of a much larger community.
1.   The NSF contracts with the NAPs operators will include
     clauses that determine how the NAP services will be priced.      It is important that NSF disclose and receive comment on all
     pricing proposals before they become final.  NSF should
     create an online discussion list to facilitate public dialog
     on the pricing proposals, and NSF should identify its
     criteria for selecting a particular pricing mechanism,
     addressing the issue of how the pricing system will impact
     the Internet's role in facilitating democratic debate.
2.   NSF should create a consumer advisory board which would
     include a broad cross section of consumer interests,
     including independent network service providers (NSPs),
     publishers of Internet discussion groups and distribution
     lists, academic networks, librarians, citizen groups and
     individual users.  This advisory board should review a
     number of policy questions related to the operation of the
     Internet, including questions such as the NAP pricing, NAP
     operator disclosure of financial, technical and operational
     data, systems of Internet accounting which are being tested
     on the vBNS and other topics.
3.   NSF should solicit public comment, though an online
     discussion group, of the types of safeguards against
     anticompetitive behavior by the NAPs which should be
     addressed in the NSF/NAPs contracts, and on issues such as
     NAPs pricing and Internet accounting systems.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
The beta version of PGP 2.5 is now being removed from MIT file servers.
In about a week,  MIT will begin  distribution of a new release numbered
PGP 2.6. PGP 2.6 will incorporate a new version of RSAREF, scheduled for
release by RSA Data Security next week, and  will also correct bugs that
were reported in PGP 2.5.
In order  to   fully protect  RSADSI's intellectual  property  rights in
public-key technology, PGP 2.6 will be designed so  that the messages it
creates after September 1,  1994 will be  unreadable by earlier versions
of PGP that infringe patents licensed exclusively to Public Key Partners
by MIT and Stanford University. PGP 2.6 will continue to be able to read
messages generated by those earlier versions.
MIT's intent is  to discourage continued use  of the earlier  infringing
software,  and to give  people adequate time  to upgrade. As part of the
release process, MIT has commissioned an independent legal review of the
intellectual property issues surrounding earlier releases of PGP and PGP
keyservers. This   review determined  that PGP  2.3  infringes  a patent
licensed by MIT to RSADSI, and that keyservers that primarily accept 2.3
keys  are mostly  likely   contributing to this  infringement.  For that
reason,  MIT encourages all non-commercial  users in the U.S. to upgrade
to PGP 2.6,  and all keyserver operators  to no longer accept keys  that
are identified as being produced by PGP 2.3.
226 Transfer complete.

care for artist who are interested in encryption...

to me at lile I will not be posting to cypherpunks after this message.

Such software patents really need to be challenged, If you are interested
in helping, please contact the LPF (League for Programming Freedom). I'll send their addr shortly....
By the way, I re-subscribed myself to this list last night. Thanks for all
the great notes. :)

@_subject: Re: Email Stalking on CNN 
I am pretty sure that kill files work silently. THe whole point is
to not be bothered with mail coming from a person. Haven't heard from Sternlight in awhile.... :)
As for AOL, I am not sure what mailer she was using and if she even knows how to use such things as killfiles. Prehaps someone
could get an account on AOL and investigate what is offered in this
It would be great if the oldones could inform the newones... though
it's hard. Prehaps we should write a book...
