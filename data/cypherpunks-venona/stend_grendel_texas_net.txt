way of presenting the information is newsworthy.  Yes, it
over-simplifies the costs of collecting the transactions to force, but
the sound bite nature of reporting today requires that.  The government
is trying to give people warm fuzzies about the 'security' of 40-bit
encryption, and we, unfortunately, need to be spreading FUD about that.
This helps to do that.

this band for something truely useful, like an automatic time sync and

first, the sheer volume of TV broadcasting.  No service could possibly
rate all TV content.  Second, no service could rate _live_ TV, such as
the nightly news, or post-game NFL locker room films.  My guess is
that the producer of a program will get first shot at putting a label
on a program, or not.  Then the distributor will be able to keep the
producers label, change it, add their own, or remove it.  This will
continue until the broadcaster gets to decide whether or not to
transmit a V-Code, and whether to use the last distributors label or
their own.  But do you really think that MTV will use a V-Code?  (It
could be amusing if they did - 10 minutes of blank screen, then 2
minutes of commercials when someone cranks all of their settings to
Full Filter.)

the market yet.  And, from appearances, it doesn't pixelate the
picture, it blocks the signal entirely.  They should at least have put
a 'Sorry, kiddies, you have to hack your parents passcode to see
this.' message up.  That's the weakness here - it was only a 4 digit
passcode locking the V-Chip level - does anyone really think that some
kid who wants to watch HBO or MTV isn't gonna cycle through the
numbers, even if it is only a few dozen at a time?  Or that there
isn't a reset mechanism for when Pop forgets the code and he really
wants to watch 'Showgirls' on PPV?

Apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so, since it has been

the Bible has been removed from at least one Web site, presumably due
to fear of prosecution.

'religious right' (why don't we ever hear of the 'religious left', who
are prolly just as much in support of banning porn?), I have to take
exception to this.  I'm appalled by the CDA, and, if you start
pointing out to religious supporters of the CDA that it has already
resulted in the King James version of the Bible being removed from (at
least) one web site, I'm sure that some of them will be as well,
especially the fundamentalists for whom the spread of the Gospel is,
well, gospel.  Be sure to point out that the same courts who the blame
for 'removing prayer from our schools' would be ruling on the indency
of the Bible.  As for supporting GAK/banning non-GAK, I don't think
that you would dispute that the 700 Club is strongly dominated by the
religious right, and it came out firmly AGAINST the entire notion of
GAK during the Clipper debate.
