Kinda-Fair-Secret Message Passing
                           -OR-
                  Self-Decrypting Messages
I have an IDEA.  It may have already been thought of....
  - PGP is great, but like so many infant technologies,
    encryption programs are not quite "turnkey".
  - Many people do not have PGP installed.  I want to send
    messages to some of these people.  (Oh, I know, a true
    geek doesn't bother to communicate with PlaintextPunks!)
  - Securely encrypted messages with programmable "key
    question" and "response key" for self-decryption.
  Fred wants to send a message to Ida.  Fred is a cypherpunk
  and is quite proficient with PGP.  However, Ida is not
  set up with PGP and does not desire to learn PK cryptography.
  Fred and Ida know each other (or something about each other).
  Fred sends a self-decrypting message to Ida in an executable
  file.  Ida simply receives the file and executes it.  (This
  is analogous to self-extracting zip files.)
  When the file is executed, it will ask Ida a question that Fred
  has set up (with her in mind).  This question will ideally be
  answerable only by Ida.  If Ida answers correctly, her response
  will form a key to decrypt the message.
I have thought a bit about the implementation.  It seems that
it may be pretty simple to do using PGP Tools.  The passphrase
recognition could use a one-way function (MD5?).  IDEA could
be the encryption algorithm.  RSA is not needed.
The tricky part is providing an executable file while providing
a little bit of instruction at the front of this file (to instruct
the recipient to down-load and execute).
Also, it seems that an assumption of recipient platform (e.g. DOS,
Unix, etc.) may be necessary.  Uuencoding or similar ASCII/binary
conversion may be required.
Comments?  Would someone do this?  Does it already exist?
It would be a nice augmentation to the PGP package!

@_subject: Re: 
All sounds great, but there is one problem - Ida has to download the
file, uudecode it and run it.  I don't see how that's any easier than
downloading it and running pgp...  If Ida is computer-illiterate and
can't download a file and decrypt it with pgp, it wouldn't be reasonable
to expect her to download it and run uudecode.
I think you may have a good idea here, but it's not really ideal for
cryptography.  As Thomas Edison was fond of saying, just because
something doesn't do what you want doesn't mean it's useless.  Perhaps
you should consider the project from a different approach - such as for
self-extracting graphical email.  I know a lot of people who would like
to be able to doodle graphical images in their email, as well as a lot
of hardware hackers that would like to draw circuit diagrams and such. Seems like self-extracting graphical email would be ideal for these
purposes.  And of course, you would want to protect it with crypto too.

@_subject: Re: self-decrypting messages 
I assume you mean embedded binary (under radix 64).  In Unix land,
uudecode could be assumed or a script version of radix decoding
could run against itself.
You are quite correct in assumption of platform.  This is a bummer.
The ubiquity of DOS makes this a bother rather than a block.  (I'll
bet even you at least _see_ a DOS box occasionally!  :)
"Ida, remember our last conversation....  who were we talking
about?  (Please provide full name properly capitalized.)"
"Ida, you and I were reading the newspaper in the break room the
other day.  We discussed a point of mutual interest.  What was it?"
The less intimately I know the recipient, the tougher it is to
formulate a good question.
I agree, moderately secure.
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Yes.  :(

@_subject: keeping secrets from myself 
Here is a practical problem that has me frustrated....
Assume that I am the treasurer at my local church.  This implies
responsibility to record each Sunday's offering (the money
collected) in the church financial books.  An account is
maintained for each member of the church.  Money received from
members each Sunday is credited to their respective accounts.
Each January, a report is prepared for each parishioner showing a
summary of the charitable contributions for the previous year.
This information is used for tax purposes.
Currently, the treasurer knows EVERYTHING about EVERYONE (regarding
charitable giving).  As a privacy advocate, this is indeed
uncomfortable (for giver and treasurer).
I want to know as little as possible about church member giving.
Give and Take:
It will be difficult/impossible to prevent the treasurer from
seeing each weeks' checks.  However, a privacy improvement may
be achieved if the running totals are kept hidden.
How can I provide a comprehensive year-end statement to each
parishioner while maintaining maximum privacy?
Does cryptography have anything to offer to this situation?
What procedures/protocols could be implemented?
What privacy enhancements could be included with the church
accounting software?

@_subject: disposable cash VISA 
... along the lines of anonymous cash (and contrary to the AntiCash!) ...
What does it take to _issue_ bank cards?  Can any bank or credit union
issue bank cards?  What does it take to get the VISA or MasterCard
It _seems_ that it should be so simple to set up anonymous credit
cards.  Here is one simple scenario:
Mr. Credit Union gets VISA's approval to issue "secure" (prepaid)
VISA cards.
Mr. Credit Union has a _good_ reputation, and this reputation is
important to his business.
Mr. Credit Union sets up 1000 accounts with $500 in each account.
A bank card is associated with each account.  The name on the front
of the card is something like "Joe Cash".
Miss Customer walks into Mr. Credit Union's place of business
and buys one of these cards for cash (the green, paper kind).  She
chooses one from a fish bowl full of them (ensuring a random acct The card would cost something like $505.
No exchange of names, no SS  no credit checks.
Miss Customer uses the card like any other VISA.  When the $500 is
gone, she "discards".
It would be easy for Mr. Credit Union to cheat. Therefore, the
reputation is important.
Why not?  Why can't _I_ sell these sorts of credit cards?  Does this
truly provide additional privacy?

This reminds me of the "dialect" text filters for LaTeX/groff.
I remember late, late one night in my undergrad days in the basement
computer room of Purdue EE playing with "valspeak" (valley girl talk)
and "brospeak" (jive talk).
Most humorous were the highly technical report files after being passed
through valspeak.... "....the results of the quantum electro dynamic
experiments were, like, gag me with a spoon, unexpected, my Mom, like
makes me do the dishes...."
I laughed 'til I cried after running the document through valspeak AND
THEN through brospeak... "QED Mo-Fo, gag-me!"
Seriously though, I am unfamiliar with the technicalities behind
*speak, but could guess some sort of substitution table.  Is there
an expert out there?  How tough would it be to make:
     - detspeak
     - detweil    (cat QED.tex | detweil | mail cypherpunks)  !!
     - weilerize
Next we could capture our other prominent personalities!
     - tcmayspeak  (Didn't tmp already try this!?)
The filter for Bruce S. could insert typos!! ;)

I am especially interested in the "strange attractors" aspect of chaos
theory.  A good article on strange attractors appeared in Scientific
American in the early/mid '80s.  (Mail/post me if you want me to look up
the issue.)  Douglas Hofstadter was the author (of Godel, Escher, Bach...
an awesome book!).
Strange attractors use feedback to "lock in".  I have used strange
attractors to find special points in n-dimensional spaces.
It may be far-fetched, but strange attractors or some similar
statistical/experimental method may be the means by which large
numbers are factored some day....

decrypt/verify incoming notes/posts.
Yarn (stable beta version .64) can be retrieved by ftp from
oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/offline/yarn-064.zip (as well as

Is "indistinguishability" the point or "interoperability"?
If the latter, then no change to generated version numbers should
be necessary/desired.  I believe that 2.6 plans to read previous

Speaking of safes and the psychology of passwords....
A very funny (and scientifically interesting) book is:
_Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman_
One of its chapters (entitled "Safecracker" if my memory serves)
discusses the locking file cabinets and safes used by the scientists
working on the Manhattan Project (_big_ bomb).
Richard P. Feynman took great joy picking, cracking and otherwise
bypassing these security measures.  He got no end of joy guessing
passwords (combinations) based on the personality of the safe owner.
The first digits of pi and e were common....
One very high military muckety-muck spent a great deal of money for
a walk-in safe with very thick, hardened steel walls.  (Since the importance of secrets is obviously proportional to rank!)
The high muckety-muck never took the time to change the default
The math is easy; its the cultural side of crypto that tough!
P.S.  There is a compact disk recording available of the late Mr. Feynman actually telling this story (along with some of his
famous bongo music).  It is a treasure if you are interested in
that sort of thing.  I don't have the address of the publisher,
but it can be found somewhere in the second biography of RPF.

I am interested in identifying source code (similarities).
I would like to review literature and available programs for recognizing

suit in this case.)
I have heard of computer science professors using such programs to thwart would-be cheaters on class programming assignments.  From what
