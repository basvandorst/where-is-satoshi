The DEA probably didn't do shit, if you were (are) paying  attention, the
DEA has had its hands tied by the state department and the CIA for years.
As they are now an arm of the FBI, they have been almost totally deballed.
 When Klaus Barbie and his mercenaries from Argentina overthrough the
Government of Bolivia back in '80, it was blessed by the CIA and the State
department, cause the Bolivians were defineatly going "left". Bolivia is
now and was at the time, a coca country, that is their principal export.
Nearly 1/2 of all our cocaine comes from there. It is transported through
the Honduras and Coloumbia, Both CIA "Friendly" countries. The biggest dope
exporters are always up to their necks in CIA and US state department.
 Pay attention. The DEA has attempted to deal with this, and many of their
operatives end up fired or dead, this is why so many of them resigned back
in the late 80's after DEA operative Enrique (Kiki) Camerara was tortured
to death by the Mexican Government. The State department had the white
house (Ronald) get the DEA to back off the investigation after they
implicated top government and military people in Mexico as being involved
in the torture.
 The DEA may not actually be the "Good" Guys, but there are some much worse
out there

I suppose this part could be true.
Phil Zimmerman has been shown to be a person of remarkable personal
integrity and
since he was up on and beat charges of illegally exporting munitions, I
some how find a
lame threat of a frame up for narcotic trafficking as making him cave to
the "shadowy" government
wishes a bit hard to swallow.
Oh yeah, sorry, I forgot that the all powerful TC was behind it all, so of
course its true.
Somehow, I just don't see the FSF collaborating and caveing to threats.
Also please note that
all of this code under discussion has been and is constantly being reviewed
by some of these here fine folks
and thus far, ain't no one found this often rumored secret back door, but
then again, I am quite sure the TC is behind the coverup.

If it is a crime to posses photograhic child pornograhy, and this crime is
tested in court., ,
Then is it a crime for a sightless person to posses  photograhic child
pornograhy? If so,
than this matter needs to be thought out some more. If no (by test of
court, paper is more or less
meaningless) than it is thought crime.

@_subject: cypherpunk listserve usefulness 
As much as it shames me, I have recently discovered that by filtering
messages from only 2 participants and setting body filters on 3 keywords
have remarkably improved the usefulness of this listserve.
As much as I do enjoy some of the filtered subject matter, I really feel it
is very off subject and makes this listserver useless for the intended task.
I guess that makes me a censor and it has me reexamining some things.

Fairfax County, In the Peoples Republic of Virginia
Citizens in the PRV who have been travelling in Fairfax County will soon
be recieving summons to come pay their dues to the monster in the form of
traffic citations for running red lights issued by Big Brother.
Yes, rest assured that Big Brother is watching. Three CopBots have been
deployed around the county to take pictures of vehicles exiting
intersections after the light has turned red. These CopBots are a great
boon to our prosperity and security as they free up the huminoid Cops from
traffic duties so that they can better spend their time toilet plunger
In the month since this "trial program" began, over 3 thousand citations
have been prepared and will be in the mail as of TODAY!!!. All Hail Big
Brother, security is at hand!! Hurrah!!
With this wonderful sucess, We can all look forward to this items being
placed in our domiciles in order to further protect us from crime.
This is truely a great day.
Weep for joy!
I love Big Brother.

Now THAT is interesting,
seems in Colo, they have some idea about the bill of rights, even though
the plunger-kicker is a doughnut whore, it is still present at the scene,
rather than being an unmanned Bot.
So the plunger-kicker, hypothetically could be crossexamined in court,
unlike the Bots of the Peoples Republik of Virginia.
Isn't there a wierd clause about being able to face your accuser??? Yeah, I
know, I live in a fantasy world.

snip snip snip snip
Dear Zooko;
I dunno much about cypherpunking, I dunno much about much at all,
I do know a little about marksmanship, I do know a little about
countersniping, I do know a little about use-of-force.
The marksman in question fired -we are led to belive- without being
certain of his target.
This is contrary to all aspects of this type of shooting.
Either the marksman in question is a murderer, or he made a very very very
very very very very very bad judgement call that he has been trained in
probably hundreds of hours of instruction, NOT TO MAKE.
Manslaughter is when you get something in your eye while driving and run
down a bicyclist. Not when you recive hour opon hour opon hour of training
in long distance sniping and hour opon hour opon hour of shoot/no shoot
scenario training and hour opon hour opon hour of use-of-force briefings,
and you STILL shoot.
Thats not manslaughter, thats something else entirely.
When you recieve your training in these matters, you are told quite clearly
tha t the action you take that adds up to the time between 1/20th to 1/10th
of a second that it takes to actually "take the shot" will be reviewed and
second guessed by very many people with hours and hours to think about it,
therefore one had better be pretty damned certain of ones target before
committing that shot.
better be DAMNED certain.
Even dumb ole me, who ain't no crack shot, with one of those nifty (off the
shelf) Styer-Mannlicher countersniper rifles with the neato Zeiss
autoranging scope was able to punch a coke can 5 for 5 after one ranging
(cheater) shot at 600 meters. I'm told that the FBI has much nicer rifles
than that. And I ain't trained.

Good day list.
I was just in the process of mailing off a copy of the GNU
junk email contract to some sammer or another, and it occured to
It would certainly be nice to collect that 10buks a hit for this
It will never happen,
Seems alot the spam I recieve originates with a node from uu.net and I am
no big
fan of Ubermesiter John Sidgmore,
Wouldn't it be nice to hold uu.net culpable for all their spamming ways. They
want to own the internet, let them hang for it.
Just a thought, anyone intested in doing a class action to recover
email processing fees?
