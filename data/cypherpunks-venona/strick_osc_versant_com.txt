My guess: no.
Just a guess, but based on the way it was worded and what troublesome forgeries frequently look like and say, I would
bet that the message to you about the alleged trash was forged, and
is not responding to any such event.

The old CDC CYBER machines had population count in its instruction
set.  Perhaps some scientific-type programmers would know what they
used it for.  The CYBER did not have a lot of instructions -- they
were pretty practical about what they put in.   i.e.  != VAX # My first thought is that it's a very quick way to do linear error # detection codes, since this instruction directly computes the Hamming # weight of a code word.
That was always my assumption.  Anyway, it's not unprecedented.

DES defines an encryption algorithm, but not how it is deployed
in an environment. Questions I would have:
    --  Is the key that the user types in used DIRECTLY as a

    --	Where does it get an initialization vector?

and if one can account for all bytes on disk that change when the
package is used (so that we know it is not escrowing keys or doing
anthing stupid with them), then I might feel comfortable about
the product.
I don't think this is unreasonable to ask.  It would particularly
make me feel safe about the problems we heard described earlier, where
someone was unable to decrypt files.   If I can deploy and use my own
decryption mechanism to doublecheck Norton, then it's more likely
my own fault if I cannot recover some file.

# # #                    A Cypherpunk's Manifesto
# #                         by Eric Hughes
# # Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.
# Privacy is not secrecy.  A private matter is something one doesn't
# want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one
# doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively
# reveal oneself to the world.  # # If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of
# their interaction.  Each party can speak about their own memory of
# this; how could anyone prevent it?  One could pass laws against it,
# but the freedom of speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to
# an open society; we seek not to restrict any speech at all.  If many
# parties speak together in the same forum, each can speak to all the
# others and aggregate together knowledge about individuals and other
# parties.  The power of electronic communications has enabled such
# group speech, and it will not go away merely because we might want it
# to.
# # Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a
# transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary
# for that transaction.  Since any information can be spoken of, we
# must ensure that we reveal as little as possible.  In most cases
# personal identity is not salient. When I purchase a magazine at a
# store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. # When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive messages,
# my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying
# or what others are saying to me;  my provider only need know how to
# get the message there and how much I owe them in fees.  When my
# identity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the transaction,
# I have no privacy.  I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must
# _always_ reveal myself.
# # Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction
# systems.  Until now, cash has been the primary such system.  An
# anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system.  An
# anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when
# desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.
# # Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography.  If I say
# something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it.  If # the content of my speech is available to the world, I have no
# privacy.  To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and to
# encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for
# privacy.  Furthermore, to reveal one's identity with assurance when
# the default is anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.
# # We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless
# organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence.  It is to
# their advantage to speak of us, and  we should expect that they will
# speak.  To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the
# realities of information. Information does not just want to be free,
# it longs to be free.  Information expands to fill the available
# storage space.  Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin;
# Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and
# understands less than Rumor.
# # We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any.  We must
# come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions
# to take place.  People have been defending their own privacy for
# centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret
# handshakes, and couriers.  The technologies of the past did not allow
# for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do.
# # We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems.  We
# are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail
# forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic
# money.
# # Cypherpunks write code.  We know that someone has to write software
# to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do,
# we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow
# Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all
# to use, worldwide.  We don't much care if you don't approve of the
# software we write.  We know that software can't be destroyed and that
# a widely dispersed system can't be shut down. # # Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is
# fundamentally a private act.  The act of encryption, in fact, removes
# information from the public realm.  Even laws against cryptography
# reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence.
# Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with
# it the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible. # # For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract.
# People must come and together deploy these systems for the common
# good.  Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's
# fellows in society.  We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your
# concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive
# ourselves.  We will not, however, be moved out of our course because
# some may disagree with our goals.
# # The Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for
# privacy.  Let us proceed together apace.

That seems so unfortunate that the "average utilizaton" and the
"peak throughput" [I use quotes because I may have the wrong technical buzzwords, but you know what I mean] have to be
one and the same.
I've been trying to think of ways around that.  Am I wasting my time?
I've thought of trying to find probabilistic ways of letting you
vary how much your read/write to the net each day, maintaining
some constant statisics (average amount you read/write, standard
deviation, ...), that allows you one day to read a lot more than
the average, when you need to, without giving away that it was
useful information instead of padding. But I'm afraid it still gives away partial bits of information --
it is still likely that the hungriest readers and the most verbose
writers match up.
This becomes more on my mind, as I work on DCNet protocols.

The idea of using well known names and well known hierarchies and
fairly static connectivity with long TTLs (like DNS does) in order to
get addressing and routing information does not seem as desirable in a
Sometimes it seems better to have static topology: if a couple of nodes
I trust are in my dining ring and each ring connected to mine, I feel
fairly confident doing business.  I can take the time to get the right
people around me.  But static topologies allow more time for third
parties to form alliances and collude.
So perhaps every few seconds we should all get up, run around the room,
grab hands with different partners, and start new rings.  But then you
don't have time to check out the reputations of your new neighbors.
I can imagine a world of dining cryptographers in which 95% of the
participants all work for the same highly-funded branch of the
government and are in collusion ...

# One thing that frustrates me is the difficulty of easily providing
# implementations of cryptographic algorithms that would be useful on a
# wide range of machines.  A lot of these algorithms are really simple,
# almost trivial.  Yet to write programs to implement them takes pages and
# pages of code, and making them portable so that people on PC's, Mac's, and
# Unix machines can use them is almost impossible.
My experience has been much better.  I do have a TCL-based crytpo
tookit running, currently on SunOS, although some of the work (RSAREF
wrappers) I did on macintosh.  I think most of the pieces in this
list port to MAC or DOS, using ANSI_C+POSIX emulation:
Along with the tcl7.0 for MAC (for THINK6.*, altho in about 2 hrs
I got it running under THINK5.* as well) comes ANSI and enough-of-POSIX
libraries, sufficient to do most of what you need.
I assume ANSI and enough-of-POSIX are available for PC as well?
(I've never done programming on PC, so I can't speak from experience.)
And I assume assume we can find TCP (Berkeley Sockets functions) for MAC and PC.
This toolkit is sufficient to do most anything we've talked about.  I
want to supplement this with more stuff -- IDEA, UDP, cme's trans,
tripleDES, etc. -- but it already contains at least one implementation
of what you need to prototype almost anything we've talked about.
TCL is the trick.  Using this toolkit, I implemented Knapsack in about
2 hours (because it was my first one), El Gamel in half an hour, and a
DH-exchanged- DES-encrypted TCL-shell session over TCP in 2 hours.
Most anything becomes a one-evening job, except DC-nets, because it has
so many componenets....
I'm trying to shape this into a release.  This will have to be a
strictly-US-citizen-in-the-USA highly-controlled release, like
RSAREF and RIPEM are.  Sorry...

I agree that Clinton's shift to value individual liberties is a good thing.
(However his support for anything is always subject to change....)
However what we have now is a list of frequencies that it is illegal
for you to listen to -- 2600 published the list as a service to its
members :-).
The cypherpunk platform here should be not merely for more liberty to
use electronic gadgets, but for relying on technology rather than laws
to assure privacy.  This argument could be made regardless of whether
an administration wanted to see more or less liberty/privacy -- as long
as it wants there to be some liberty/privacy.
I'm sure you already know these, I think it's important to distinguish
the arguments.

Russell Brand has observed that many people only send PGP mail to
people with whom they have personally exchanged keys -- that even the

In this case, a single symmetric key exchange transaction between two

I have thought seriously about a revival of symmetric key exchange,
with the look and feel of a PGP key signing session, but without

being designated a speaker -- which did give me a chance to introduce
my pet topics, but had some disadvantages as well -- I lost the ability
to chat quietly with people in my row, and I felt compelled to say
something even when I had nothing to say.  I also noticed that others
who were not speakers did not feel like full participants in the event.
Now don't take these criticisms too strongly.  I was very impressed
on the whole with how well it went in spite of a few problems, and it
was really cool having far-flung punks join us.    I stayed for nearly two hours, when really I had thought it could last 30 minutes at most.
As for IRC, I'm attracted to the idea of a free-for-all, but I honestly
was not able to follow anything when everyone had gathered together
but before the speach controls were imposed -- there were just too many  threads at once, and I couldn't find the ones I was following.
Anyway, some brainstorms follow.  I think these are not too different from what we were trying before, and could be easily implemented.

offer some implementations, but alas i haven't.)

throughout the rows, so they can answer questions about how to use the
moo.  If a few others on the row overhear the question/answers, it
doesn't hurt and may educate them, too.  Wouldn't hurt if someone on
each row had some semi-wizardly powers as well, so they could fix
inequities and problems they perceive.
Conch:  Remember the Conch shell in the Lord of the Flies -- in order to
talk you had to have the conch.  A protocol might be to have eight
conchs, and you enqueue when you ask for the conch, and you release
it when you are done, and the next person in line gets it.  If I say "drop conch" and Julf is next in line (he had typed "wait conch"), the mud could announce
and these messages would be easy to ignore or to follow.  Anyway, this
would limit the number of speakers at any one time, but allow a rotation
of everyone to be able to speak.   Improvement:
lets you type ahead one message while you're waiting in queue.
Then "wait conch" alone kills your typeahead message, but doesn't change
your status in line, in case someone already made your comment.
Build some limits into the conch -- you automatically drop if after
five broadcasts or after 3 minutes.  Wizards should be able to tweak
things like this in realtime.
Priorities:  I had thought about handing everyone a dozen digitickets
as they walked into the door.  It would cost you one ticket every time
you spoke.  This would cause you to ration your comments.  But a more
general way of achieving the same effect, yet adjusting gently to
actual conditions (how did I know 12 was the right number of tickets?),
is to imitate an operating system's prioritized wait queue.  Give top
priority to people who have never spoken before.  They get the next
conch available.  A generalization is to use "priority aging", like
UNIX nice(1), so that the longer it's been since you spoke, the better
your advantage over others waiting.  BIG MACS and MEDUSA'S SISTERS could be given extra advantage, nice -10, and SUSPECTED PSYCHOWONX and
Unreal Persons could be nice'd +10 if a wizard deemed them disruptive.
The nice thing is that if there are eight conchs and there are only eight
people who want to talk, they get the eight conchs, regardless of their
priorities.  The algorithm adapts to the circumstances.
Practice:  24 hours before the appointed meeting, there should be a practice meeting, a dress rehersal, but with bogus topics and a silly
attitude, to try out the software and for everyone to become familiar with
the process.  Topics should be like
and of course
and any other space-filling curves we don't want to waste time on
at the real meeting.

If you're interested in details of these patents, I have (at home) a
copy of (almost all of) the "full wrapper" of the four patents held by
Public Key Partners, referenced in RFC1170:
      Cryptographic Apparatus and Method
      ("Diffie-Hellman")............................... No. 4,200,770
      Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus
      and Method ("Hellman-Merkle").................... No. 4,218,582
      Cryptographic Communications System and
      Method ("RSA")................................... No. 4,405,829
      Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus
      and Method ("Hellman-Pohlig").................... No. 4,424,414
A couple of others on The List also have copies of the wrappers.
But it seems you're asking about the existance of a different
type of patent than these?  Or you're clarifying what type of
patents these are?
If they all say "Apparatus" and "Method", is that both a "device" and
a "process"?
