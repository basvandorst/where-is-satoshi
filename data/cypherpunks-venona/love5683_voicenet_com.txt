It was only months ago that they passed a bill raising alot of speed limits
to the 75mph range.

let me tell ya' I live in Central Texas and regularly use I-35, which was
the primary highway considerd for the bill. The speed limits were raised to
75 mph at increments of every 4 to 5 miles. By that I mean the minute you
pass the sign that says 75 with good eyes you can see the one up ahead that
says 65 or 55 and you might even catch a glimpse of the state trooper parked
beside it. I personally think its a joke and an inconvience, I was totally
for the the bill as it was stated but this "red light, green light" game is
very disapointing. Just goes to show the government still can't do anything
