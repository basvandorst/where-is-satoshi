Does anybody know of a mailing-list for VRML?
I have tried www-VRML but there is nothing, least not
Any help and/or direction would be appreciated.
Thanks in Advance,
UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN :-)

This lexis-nexus is running around again, is this a true statement?
Or another hoax going around?
I had not seen any comments on this list yet.  The person who forward this to me had not provided where this
originated from.
Thank You
