@_subject: NSA readings 
If one is looking to find out as much as possible on the NSA (it
s past doings as well as known present doings), what should one
read, aside from the aforementioned "Puzzle Palace"?
Are there any other accurate books or articles available?

@_subject: Re:  Hidden encrypted messages 
Of course, if someone knew what they were looking for, it "would be trivial"
to set up some sort of filter to find this type of message (in this case, one
with a great number of spaces).  This assumes unnoticability due to lack of
knowledge, which is the current thought process being applied to computer
security.  It's a very falible one, as many companies have found.  If you
assume whatever kind of filter you may be dealing with will be a program
(and not a person) looking for a certain frequency of special characters, or
just a range in which >90% of your characters fall (like do you use many more
alphanumerics than *&&*^%$ then you could just have every fifth letter in your _Alice_ transmission be a character of your encrypted message..
  On the other hand, in dealing with that kind of program, I'm sure you could
write some program that would represent non-alphanumerics with a recognizable
code of alphanumerics which wouldn't be normally generated by the encryptor
(and failing that, just convert the entire piece to hex or something..).
Hmm, in writing this it seems to me that hiding a encrypted file in a way that
would evade anything drempt up to distiguish it from text is a lot more difficult than just calling it something else:  "Umm, yeah Mr. NSA, that was
a sound file of the pgp sound format!  ..right."  (or that noise suggestion too)

I've been told that the CRT is not what is generating the signals at all, rather
that it is the CPU, and that having an LCD screen won't save you, strength of
signal reduced or otherwise.

@_author: yeah, right 
@_subject: tapping method unmentioned 
about the advancement of government regulated cryptography, I haven't seen much
mentioned on *how* the government would go about collecting a certain exchange.
bill circulating in the legislature that proposed that phone co's build tappability into the newer non-copper phone system?  Is the phone co's cooperation on this issue part of a bargain to exclude such capability from the
system (yeah, right) or is the government focusing on this issue now because it
has already accomplished what it wants in other areas of privacy (read: tapping)

@_subject: Re: OUTDIAL SERVICE 
I don't know if this is consistant with what everyone here is talking about in
regards to "outdialing serivce," but some time ago I heard about a 900 number
that a person could call, that would redirect their call so as to avoid being
traced, etc.  Oddly enough, I think they advertised that all the calls are logged and kept in some vault in another state.  I may be confusing something here though.  (As if this is the case, they've probably gone out of buisness.)

your message, then attempting to create some larger ody of text in which to
hide the message, one would first generate the message to be hidden, then take an existing body of text (something large enough, like Shakespear's
MacBeth) and then attempt to find some concise algorithm by which the
recieving end would extract the message?
