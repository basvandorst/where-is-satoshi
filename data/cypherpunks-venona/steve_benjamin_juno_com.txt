@_subject: Cyptography in the Information Age 
X-Posted: sci.crypt, cypherpunks mailing list
For my Advanced Computer Science course in school I'm required to do
a research paper each quarter.  I have decided to do this quarter's
paper on Cyptography in the Information Age.
My paper will contain a 6-line (perl) implemenation of
RSA.	Is my report subject to current Encryption Laws?
If so, which ones? I plan on making a big deal out of
how a 15 page research paper can't be exported from the U.S.A.
Also, How can I generate RSA keys in perl?
I found a C program to do it, but I don't have C installed.
Thanks for any help you can give me! and please reply
through e-mail!

1.  How can I generate 2 large prime numbers?  I doubt I could create 2,
100-digit prime numbers in my head :-)
2.  Is there an implentation of DES in perl?  I didn't see a link to one
on the export-a-sig page.  If not perl, is there one for DOS?  I'm
looking for a bare bones one, not something with tons of features
and a GUI.  A perl or dos version of the unix "des" program would be
