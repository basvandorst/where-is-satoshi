I have read quite a few of your messages related to this, Tim, and I find it quite interesting that the quintessential Crypto Anarchist has such a conservative attitude.
Long drawn out court cases are not "paid for by taxpayers".  They are paid for by the government, which happens to have stolen the funds from its victims (taxpayers).
Why does the fact that they (the government) have initiated force against you (or stolen from / taxed you) somehow imply that they now have an obligation to further their crimes by initiating force against others?

You are here, and they are not?  Then what's the problem?  I thought you had a problem with the fact that they ARE "here"!
William H. Geiger III:
This is simply and obviously not the case.  You do care what they do.  If not, you wouldn't express such violent feelings towards them.
William H. Geiger III:
By the way, what do you mean by "here"?
William H. Geiger III:
Oh, now I understand.  You mentioned the southwest U.S.A. earlier.  Obviously you have a house in the U.S.A. southwest, and some furners are on your property.  I suggest you contact your local police, or perhaps a private security firm would do a better job for you.

After all it is *very* important to have the Federal Government defend boarders against exploitation by their landlords! :-)
Seriously though.  Getting all emotionally tied up in concepts like "defending the borders" and "forcing" citizens to "aid in this invasion" may sound good, but whose land is it anyway?  I don't own a single acre, not even a single square foot of land in the entire southwestern/western part of the North American continent.

And what if "taxpayers" simply don't keep these records?  There have been quite a few things government has tried to impose on the American people in the last two hundred years, and have just been laughed at.  For example during the civil war, I believe there was a tax "imposed" which many people simply ignored.
This is absurd.  They can't possibly control every single one of us.  And who would they prove it to?  The IRS would have to have enough bureaucrats to track us all down.  - Actually they could wage a war just like the one with the Income Tax now.  Prosecute high-profile cases and publicize the hell out of them if the IRS wins, issue a gag order if the IRS loses.
Regulations do not *force* compliance.  Words on pieces of paper do not force anything on me.
Even laws against the worst thing humans could do to each other (murder) do not *force* compliance.  And such laws are the ones agreed to by most people.  If laws that have the absolute greatest support cannot prevent human actions, how can you think regulations with such broad opposition could possibly do so?

Then I take it you have almost the exact same worries about contributing to churches as you have about "contributing" to government.
Reminds me of a short exchange I had with a co-worker a couple of years ago.  He had bought a lottery ticket (which I don't do), and it went like I:  What are your chances of winning?
he:  What are *yours*?
I:  Not much different than yours!

And who is it that gets to decide what is a "crime" and what is not?  The politicos, the bureaucrats, the hoodlums in DC and elsewhere who think they have the right to run the lives of everybody else.
Again I ask the question:

I don't dispute this.  If a "crime" is defined as whatever the politicos/bureaucrats/hoodlums say it is, then a "crime" is certainly being committed.  (Of course there is another definition of crime.)
"If voting could change anything, it would have been outlawed long ago."  Not strictly true.  But if I vote or don't vote...well it's just about the same difference as whether I buy a lottery ticket or not.
Don't vote - it only ENCOURAGES them!
Citizenship, Schmitizenship.  Granted I don't want to renounce my citizenship - at least not at the moment.  But the whole game of riling up people's emotions about "citizenship" and "patriotism" is just a bread and circuses ruse to keep us focused on something other than what the professional control freaks are doing to us.
The people who made handgun ownership a felony should be sent down a dark alley without any means of self-defense.  Perhaps they would gain a small glimmer of understanding of the real issues - unless they already understand that they are the hoodlums around the corner in the dark alley.  In that case....
Lawmakers can hardly be held responsible for tying their own shoes!  I suspect you had your satire mode on full when you wrote this.

This is from Infobeat News - Morning Edition, 11/24/97
I think it is really cool that a private company can actually negotiate somewhat as an equal with a government.  One implication of this is that Microsoft is becoming a more powerful corporation - which is not necessarily a good thing.
But the other thing it might imply is that the power of government is slipping - which is definitely a good thing.

I agree with your assessment of the interdependence of economic freedom
and personal freedom.  But the Nolan chart itself is not flawed - the
political belief systems that it describes are flawed.  That is, any
political belief system that advocates different levels of governmental
control for the two - that belief system is flawed.
The Nolan chart does a much better job of describing them than the
traditional left-right spectrum does.  Nor have I seen a better
descriptive device.
Incidentally, here is my score:
