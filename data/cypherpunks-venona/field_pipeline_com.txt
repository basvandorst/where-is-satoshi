The U.S. Export Administration Regulations (Commerce Department) include
the following definitions:
  "Cryptography" -- "The discipline that embodies principles, means and
methods for the transformation of data in order to hide its information
content, prevent its undetected modification or prevent its unauthorized
use.  'Cryptography' is limited to the transformation of information using
one or more 'secret parameters' (e.g., crypto variables) and/or associated
key management.  Note: 'Secret parameter': a constant or key kept from the
knowledge of others or shared only within a group." (Part 772)
  "Information security" -- "All the means and functions ensuring the
accessibility, confidentiality or integrity of information or
communications, excluding the means and functions intended to safeguard
against malfunctions.  This includes 'cryptography', 'cryptanalysis',
protection against compromising emanations and computer security."
  These definitions and others are used within the Commerce Control List
(Supplement No. 1 to Part 774) to regulate the export of certain Information
Security related equipment, software, etc. (Category 5:II).
  The U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (State Department) also
regulates (until 1/1/97, when jurisdiction is expected to move to Commerce)
the export of certain "Cryptographic systems", etc. including those with the
capability of maintaining secrecy or confidentiality of information systems.

Military Equipment)

them back to the original group of 1's & 0's.
law make a diference between an "encryption" program and a "compression"
program other than the fact that the encryption program is advertized as
encryption and the compression program is advertized as compression?

No need to turn this into Constitutional Law 101, but you might wish to
look at Article I, Section 10.

@_subject: Database law... silver lining?? 
Should a database protection law such as HT 3531 be enacted in the U.S.,
it just may turn out to be the best weapon yet for the protection of
personal data.  Why shouldn't a "database" be interpreted to include an
individual's personal data?  All that is required is that it be "arranged in
a systematic or methodical way".  Heck, that's not so hard.  And a "database
maker" isn't necessarily Lexis (the compiler of P-TRAK) and friends, it is
each individual who originally made a "substantive" (i.e., lifetime)
investment in the collection of the contents of his personal database.
  Based on this reasoning, P-TRAK, etc. would be considered an infringing
use, subject to civil and possible criminal actions, injunctions,
impoundment, and monetary relief.  Hmmm...

I am not suggesting patent-like protection.  Rather, I'd argue that there
is very little "independent creation" with respect to my personal database.
Provided it is considered my database to begin with, information that I give
on a warranty card, when I ask for credit, etc. remains mine under the
proposed U.S. law.  Just because a third party tries to assemble it from
those sources doesn't mean it suddenly becomes free data, from a
non-database source.  By that line of reasoning, any protected database
would lose all protection upon its publication by a licensee, so long as you
copied it from the licensee and not the originator.  This is not how I read
the proposed law, and it is not how big database publishers would want it read.

the proposal.)

@_subject: Re: Crypto reg clarification from Commerce Department 
To follow up on Lucky Green's conversation with Bruce Kutz on Sec. 736.2:
  The General Prohibitions (1 - 10) in the EAR preexisted these new crypto
regs.  What was changed in General Prohibition Seven (which previously
applied only to nuke and missile technologies) was the addition of a subpart
(ii):  "You may not, without a license from BXA, provide certain technical
assistance to foreign persons with respect to encryption items, as described
in Sec 744.9 of the EAR."
   Sec. 744.9 is a new addition.  It says:
   "(a)  General prohibition.  No U.S. person may, without a license from
BXA, provide technical assistance (including training) to foreign persons
with the intent to aid a foreign person in the development or manufacture
outside the United States of encryption commodities and software that, if of
United States origin, would be controlled for "EI" reasons under ECCN 5A002
or 5D002. [...] Note in addition that the mere teaching or discussion of
information about cryptography, including, for example, in an academic
setting, by itself would not establish the intent described in this section,
even where foreign persons are present." [...]
   When it comes to financing and contracting, it's General Prohibition Ten
you ought to be looking at.  That hasn't changed under the new rules and it
doesn't just apply to nukes and missiles.  It says:
   "Sec. 736.2(b)(10) General Prohibition Ten -- Proceeding with
transactions with knowledge that a violation has occurred or is about to
occur (Knowledge Violation to Occur).  You may not sell, transfer, export,
reexport, finance, order, buy, remove, conceal, store, use, loan, dispose
of, transfer, transport, forward, or otherwise service, in whole or in part,
any item subject to the EAR and exported or to be exported with knowledge
that a violation of the Export Administration Regulations, the Export
Administration Act or any order, license, License Exception, or other
authorization issued thereunder has occurred, is about to occur, or is
intended to occur in connection with the item.  Nor may you rely upon any
license or License Exception after notice to you of the suspension or
revocation of that license or exception.  There are no License Exceptions to
this General Prohibition Ten in part 740 of the EAR."
  Furthermore, in the Violations section (Sec. 764.2) it says:
   "(b) Causing, aiding, or abetting a violation.  No person may cause or
aid, abet, counsel, command, induce, procure, or permit the doing of any act
prohibited, or the omission of any act required, by the EAA, the EAR, or any
order, license or authorization issued thereunder."
   "(e) Acting with knowledge of a violation.  No person may order, buy,
remove, conceal, store, use, sell, loan, dispose of, transfer, finance,
forward, or otherwise service, in whole or in part, any item exported or to
be exported from the United States, or that is otherwise subject to the EAR,
with knowledge that a violation of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license
or authorization issued thereunder, has occurred, is about to occur, or is
intended to occur in connection with the item."
   In the past, some banks worried about this when financing letters of
credit.  I'm told they were assured back then that this sort of financing
was not going to be prosecuted....but it's still in the regs so I wouldn't
bet the ranch on it never happening.

@_subject: Re: "Technical data" exemptions in new crypto regs 
In reply to Solveig Bernstein's First Amendment challenge questions:
  I read the new regs as permitting:  (i) publication of source code in
paper form (including publications reproduced on microfilm or on prerecorded
phonograph records), or in the form of a motion picture film and soundtrack
(section 734.3(b)(2)); and, separately, (ii) teaching or discussion of
information "about" cryptography (section 744.9).  The export of other
encryption materials (including the distribution to non-US persons of source
or object code on diskettes) is restricted, even if the materials are
publicly available "educational information" for release by instruction in
catalog courses and associated teaching laboratories of academic
institutions (section 734.9).
  Technical assistance activities that go beyond "mere" teaching or
discussion of information about cryptography are restricted, if they show
"intent" to aid a foreign person in the development or manufacture, outside
the United States, of controlled encryption commodities and software.  This
is a General Prohibition (see section 736.2(b)(7)(ii)).
  I think one question to be resolved is:  could the "mere" teaching about
cryptography (which is okay), *coupled* with distribution of source code in
paper form (which is otherwise okay because it is not, by itself, subject to
the EAR - see note to section 734.3(b)(2) and (b)(3)), be considered a
violation of the EAR because it demonstrates "intent" to aid a foreign
person in the development of encryption software?  One would hope not (see
Bernstein), but the new 734.9 seems to imply that such a combination may be
   Thus, a potental First Amendment challenge to the new regs would be a
challenge to a restriction on teaching coupled with paper
publication/distribution of source code.  Another would be a challenge to
the restriction on non-paper publication/distribution, whether or not
coupled with teaching.
