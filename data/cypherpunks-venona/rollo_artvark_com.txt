@_subject: Re: "Random Sequence" 
* It's a bit anachronistic to say in 1996 that a paper written 30 years
earlier "departs from current definitions of random sequences." The authors
may have been brilliant, but they weren't prescient. I can't imagine how a computer could be smart enough to defeat an infinite
set of guessing machines without knowing ANYTHING about them. In fact,
what's wrong with this argument: call the "fooling" machine Frank, and one
of the "guessing" machine Gert. You say that Frank doesn't need to know
anything about Gert. Let me suppose however that Gert DOES know about
Frank. In that case, Gert can simulate Frank and "guess" his output, thus
foiling Frank's attempts to fool Gert!
Maybe it's the "polynomial time & space". That restricts the guesser-domain
considerably, compared with our very weak requirement that the guessers can
be any Turing machines whatever -- as long as the set of them is
effectively calculable.
BTW, is the set of ALL finite automata effectively calculable? I suspect
maybe so. If so, by essentially the argument given in the paper, there is a
computer (Turing machine) that can fool them ALL.
I hope it's okay to cc this note to coderpunks. It's not about coding per
se, but it may shed some light on what "randomness" means, and on
"computable randomness", which sounds appropriate for coderpunks to me.

@_subject: Why sign pubkey? 
Why You Should Sign Your PGP Public Key
                    Francis Litterio (franl
If you generate a public/private key-pair and distribute the public key
without any signatures on it, you are open to a denial of service attack.
Here's how the attack works. I take your unsigned public key, and (using a
suitably powerful editor, such as Emacs) I edit the userid string so that it
still has your name but my email address on it. Then I distribute this fake
key widely. Anyone who uses the fake key to encrypt email to you will send
the email to me instead (if she uses the email address in the key). Of
course, I won't be able to decrypt the email I receive, because it was
encrypted with your public key, but I have denied you the option of
decrypting it. You might never know the message was even sent.
If you have at least one signature on your public key, PGP detects the
tampering of the userid string and alerts the person who is sending you
encrypted email. This is possible because of the nature of a digital
signature. A digital signature is the output of a cryptographically secure
hash function taking as input your RSA public key and your userid string
(among other things). That hash output value is encrypted with the private
key of the signer. If you have a valid public key from the signer and if you
trust the signer to sign other people's keys, then PGP allows you to infer a
certain degree of trust that the signed key belongs to the person named in
the key's userid field.
A cryptographically secure hash function is an irreversable hash function
for which it is computationally infeasible to find an input message that
hashes to a given output value. A task is computationally infeasible if the
sun will have burned out before even the most powerful computer could finish
the task. This prevents people from forging digital signatures.
                       -------------------------------
                       How to Sign Your PGP Public Key
You should sign your PGP public key immediately after generating your
public/private key-pair. To sign your own public key, type this:
     pgp -ks where  is the userid attached to your just-generated public key. If
you have more than one userid on your public key, then you should sign each
one individually.
                       -------------------------------
                      Misconceptions About Signed Keys
A widespread misconception about self-signed public keys (i.e., keys that
have been signed by their corresponding private keys) is that a self-signed
key is somehow more valid than a key that is not self-signed. A self-signed
key is no more valid than a key with no signatures at all. Why? Suppose you
have a public key with this userid string:
     John Q. Public Here's my denial of service attack. I use PGP to generate a new
public/private key-pair with the same userid string as your public key but
having different RSA public key bits. I self-sign that public key with its
private half. I distribute that public key widely. Someone thinks it's yours
based on the userid string. She makes the mistake of concluding that it is
your key because it is self-signed. This is the mistake of inferring
validity merely from the presence of a self-signature. She uses it to
encrypt email to you, but you will not be able to decrypt that mail.
This is a different kind of denial of service attack than the one described
earlier (see Why You Should Sign Your PGP Public Key above). The only
defense against this attack (that I can think of) is to be ever-vigilent for
public keys that have your userid string but a different key-id and
The key-id is the 32 least-significant bits of your RSA modulus, which is
one of the two numbers that make up your RSA public key. The other number is
the RSA public exponent (see the mathematical guts of RSA encryption for
more details).
The key fingerprint is a cryptographically secure hash of the RSA modulus
and RSA public exponent, which together make up your public key. The
cryptographically secure hash function is Ron Rivest's MD5, which outputs a
128-bit (16-byte) number, which depends in no discernable way on every bit
in its input. It is much easier for two people to compare a 16-byte
hexadecimal value over the phone that it is for them to compare the many
hundreds or thousands of bits that compose the modulus and public exponent.
If an RSA public key were tampered with in transmission from one person to
another, comparing the fingerprints (via a tamperproof communication
channel) would certainly reveal the tampering.
The moral of this story is that you should regularly verify that the
fingerprints of distributed copies of your PGP public keys (such as those in
the PGP keyserver databases) match the fingerprints of your copies of those

@_subject: Pie cutting algorithm 
Tim May said:
<< ObCrypto Sidebar: The "fair" method for dividing a pie between two people
is well-known: "You cut, I choose." This *game theory* result is central to
many cryptographic protocols (though it may not always be apparent at
first). And the protocol can be extended to 3 parties, and proabably to N.
Research is ongoing on this, including Cypherpunk Robin Hanson's work at
Caltech. >>
I (RS) believe Claude Shannon proposed the following N-person pie-cutting algorithm more than 25 years ago:
Persons 1...N are seated around a circular table. A Thing To Be Shared (Call it a "pie") sits in front of P1 (Alice, if you prefer).
P1 cuts a slice (a portion satisfactory to her) out of the pie -- the "current slice" -- and offers the whole pie with the current slice to the person P2 (Barbara, if you like) to her left for her consideration. It is possible that P1 is so greedy that she makes the whole pie the current slice.
P2 does one of 2 things:
A. P2 cuts a smaller slice (a portion satisfactory to her, which becomes the new current slice) out of the old current slice and offers the whole pie with the new current slice to P3.
B. P2 passes (being unwilling to settle for a smaller slice of the pie than the current slice), offering the person P3 to her left the whole pie with the current slice for her consideration;
P3 does one of 2 things:
A. P3 cuts a smaller slice (a portion satisfactory to her, which becomes the new current slice) out of the old current slice and offers the whole pie with the new current slice to P4.
B. P3 passes (being unwilling to settle for a smaller slice of the pie than the current slice), offering the person P4 to her left the whole pie with the current slice for her consideration;
Eventually, someone (Pm, or Morticia) has cut a current slice, and everybody else has passed. At that point Pm gets the piece she cut, leaves the table with it, and (if N > 2) the game proceeds ab initio with N-1 people and the remaining pie. If N = 2 (two people were playing), there's now one person left (Winnie), and she gets the remaining pie.
The whole procedure terminates, with everyone satisified, after a finite number of steps.
Tim May: as a Licensed Ontologist, do you know who made the wiseassed (but deep) remark "Ontology recapitulates Philology"? or for that matter, "Oncology recapitulates Proctology".

@_subject: Why not PGP? 
I have a basic puzzlement about this whole war over strong crypto and key
escrow. I admit to being relatively crypto unsavvy, but with a strong (but
not avid) interest in the subject. Schneier sits on my bookshelf, and I
have cracked it a few times, but the prospect of studying it seriously
makes me feel slightly gut-sick.
I use PGP to communicate (presumably) strong-cryptoed messages to my
stepson Ray Hirschfeld in Amsterdam, and vice versa. He uses an
internationational version of PGP, and I use the domestic version that I
got from MIT. They seem to be compatible.
I don't intend to submit my present or future private PGP keys for key
escrow (Is that what's called GAK?). To protect myself against forgetting
my private key (which has happened once already) I'll no doubt some day put
it on a floppy and put the floppy in my bank safe deposit box.
Two questions:
1. Does anyone think that legislation might be passed which would
criminalize my communications with Ray?
2. Suppose someone writes a program Z that has no expicit crypto code in
it, but has hooks for installing one or another version of PGP. Given a
copy of Z, someone in this country could install PGP he got from MIT,
whereas someone in Europe could install the international version.
Would export of Z violate ITAR restrictions?
