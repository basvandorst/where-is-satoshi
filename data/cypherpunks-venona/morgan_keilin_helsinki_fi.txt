Some fairly basic questions:
1) Is a statistical test like this done on the net composition of the
   whole message or locally, point by point throughout the text (for
   example, using a window)?
2) If what's tested is the net composition of the message, could you
   choose padding to normalize a message back to an apparently random
   distribution?
3) What kind of computation overhead does this statistical testing
   impose (compared to what would be needed for a known-plaintext
   search)?

[I'm not a lawyer, and I can't answer Tim's question per se, but...]
As I understand it, the Bill of Rights itself was conceived strictly as
a set of limitations on the -federal- government, but that the 14th
ammendment has been interpreted to apply the Bill of Rights to limit
state and local governments.  (When and with what scope, I'm not sure.)
Section 1 of the 14th Ammendment:
All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
the jurisdiction therof, are citizens of the United States and of the
State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which
                           ------------------------------------------------------
States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or
property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

According to the Economist (20 July p. 28) the Danish ombudsman
has ruled that correspondence between the foreign ministry and
embassies must be available to the public.

It seems clear that capital investment in tools will contribute to the
-productivity- of workers.  (Tools here meaning whatever machinery/
infrastructure is used to get work done.)
Bart Croughs quotes a number of economists who seem to be saying that
when capital investment leads to increased productivity (per worker)
this also leads to higher wages.
I'm not sure I understand -why- this should necessarily be so.  It's my
impression that in manufacturing industries, the more mechanized
production is, the more workers will get paid.  Then again, perhaps a
more mechanized industry will pay more because more mechanized
industries hire workers with higher skills (albeit fewer workers).
It's my impression that when a company makes capital investments which
increase productivity, the fruits of this increased worker productivity
are shared (to some extent) with the workers.  I can imagine a number of
reasons why this might be done, but it's not absolutely clear to me
that this would be a direct result of market forces.

@_subject: [NOISE] other distributed searches 
Two distributed searches on the net are described in Science (9 August
1996 p. 743).
One is a search for "Mersenne" prime numbers: The other is called SETI and apparently going to use idle time on
people's computers (a screen saver) to search for patterns in data from
Arecibo.  The report says the project will be set up by Woody Sullivan
of University of Washington, Seattle and will operate out of a server
in Berkeley.  (I wasn't able to locate any information about this on
the web.)

@_subject: singapore and penet 
There is a report in a Helsinki newspaper (Helsingin Sanomat 31 Aug
1996, p A11) that the Singapore government has asked Finland to help
them obtain the name of a person who posted via anon.penet.fi to
usenet.  Apparently the messages in question criticize the strict laws
in Singapore and were signed using the name of the former prime
minister Lee Kwan Yew.
