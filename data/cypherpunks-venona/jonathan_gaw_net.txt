when i talk to people like the Direct Marketer's Assn., they honestly don't
understand what the fuss is about. Their attitude is, quite literally,
"What's the harm being done here?" what do you think the community interested in privacy protection can do to
best illustrate to the general public the "harm" in the collection of
personal information?

the responses i've gotten have been all too theoretical and, i believe, too
hypothetical and removed for most people. when asked if they value their
privacy, the public overwhelmingly agrees. when asked what their privacy
means to them, i don't think they have a solid answer. i get the sense that
most people don't see the hazards of corporations analyzing their buying
patterns, voter registration records and medical records. i don't think it
has come home to most people. i don't disagree with the people on the list. i am just having a hard time
translating it to the public in concrete terms. Jonathan Gaw
