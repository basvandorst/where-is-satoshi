Two observations:
* Jim Bell would be unduly suspicious if _anyone_ introduced a crypto
bill in Congress. I'm not surprised that here on conspiracypunks someone
would be raising alarums without knowing what they're talking about.
* Jim Bell says we're "overdoing it on this 'List of Shame' thing." Not
at all -- we're proud to be on it! And you, Jim Bell, are one of my
primary suspects for authorship.

A few responses to Jim Bell:
* Why would Sen. Burns introduce *this* particular crypto bill? Would
you believe that he wanted to appear cyber-clueful and net-friendly, but
didn't know exactly how to do that -- so certain people suggested that
this bill would be an appropriate way to do it?
* Why would Sen. Burns introduce this particular bill *now*? One word: CFP.
No, the primary reason for anonymity is to avoid being *associated* with
one's name. I know this may be attributing an undeserved sense of
precedence, but perhaps Jim Bell has realized that his opinions are
discarded out-of-hand by many on this list, so he posts anonymously to
regain some credibility. A message from anonymous would also work nicely
to reinforce his own position, allowing Jim Bell to claim additional
Anyway, last night I sat next to Dorothy Denning on the bus to the EFF
Pioneer Awards reception and dinner, and we chatted for about 20
minutes. She's a sweet old lady -- I can't think of anyone with whom
it's easier to agree to disagree. I asked her what she thought of a
number of people -- on Tim May she said: "Let's not talk about that."
She also said she's educating a House committee about crypto next week

A few observations:
1. Not many readers of cypherpunks are lawyers
2. Of the laywers who do read cypherpunks, many may not choose to spend
their time researching what laws AP may violate. Or they're not "slick"
lawyers; take your pick.
3. Congress would have no problems passing a law outlawing AP, if one
does not exist already.

bell The original Apple II floppy disk drive held 143KB, though you could use
extra tracks if you were ambitious. The drive was a marvel, and was
considerably ahead of its competition. I remember the Commodore 64
drives (1541?) that were just plain slothful.
You could also use the other side of the disk, of course!

application by jim bell Jim: I've worked on a presidential campaign before and can tell you that
if the FEC is likely to consider something a violation, the campaign is
not going to skirt the line.
That said, perhaps the law is outdated and needs to be changed. The
portion of the campaign finance law, as intepreted by the FEC, barring
online services from providing free accounts to political candidates, is
now being scrutinized in Congress. Rep. White will introduce a reform
bill in about two weeks.
