There was also an interesting comment made in session three of the Joint Australian/OECD Conference on Security, Privacy and Intellectual Property Protection in theGlobal Information Infrastructure,
(Canberra, 7 - 8 February 1996), reportedly by a representative of the DSD:
"... PGP may not survive as a viable option for private security."

I'm just wondering if anyone else finds it particularly odd that while
Australia is prepared to commit SAS troops, medical and intelligence
personnel to a possible strike against Iraq, the US government still
doesn't seem to trust us enough to use US developed cryptography
products with adequate security.

I imagine they(tm) would have countermeasures for this kind of thing,
given that once they catch a keyword, they know it's source, and have some
idea of the kinds of patterns which are likely to be real communications. The Web site probably went straight into a junk filter, which would make
it an ideal place to post your secrets from then on :-)
