Go to a search engine or directory. Type in the word 'freebies'.

Would I send a letter to someone without an envelope?
One word: postcard.

No, I would not tape a phone bill check to a postcard. There is the chance for it to fall off.
There is different methods of sending mail for different levels of
security and functionality. Some people make it obvious what is inside
an envelope. (who would not recognize a Christmas card from the
envelope?) Others make it as bland and normal as possible to
have it go by without much notice.
It all depends on how secure you want it. Some things you can do
with what amounts to postcard security.
What amount of security do you want for your email? Would you be
willing to do something extra for that security?
This type of question is up to each person. How much risk is the
person willing to take. Each person has the responsibility to
understand what the risks are and to decide what risks they are
willing to take.

Right. If everyone used encryption, there would not as much public
debate about it.
For now, it is not commonly used and viewed as secrative.
Now for a general question to all that may read this: How much are
you willing to do something to change the laws?
However much people are willing to stick up for this issue is the
amount things could change.

Getting that concept across is a slow process. People will want to
stay with what they are familiar with. Right now, I do not know how
to familiarize people to accept an electronic envelope.
