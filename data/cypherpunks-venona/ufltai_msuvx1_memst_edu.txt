@_subject: Needed: Source for the air force's chicken gun 
Hi,	
shot at engines to test the engine's ability to meet little flying birdies)
is for real, and if it is, a source (paper, article, etc) that says that it
exists.  I've seen this a couple of times in news, but I've never seen a source quoted.  I know this is not the usual cypherpunkish themes, but I've
found that the people on this list are some of the best informed ones, and
I am hoping you all can help.
ps: btw, I need the source quite urgently...  thanx again!
