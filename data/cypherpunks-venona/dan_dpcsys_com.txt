The CERN http daemon can be configured as a proxy server.  Since the
proxy can run on an unprivileged port you should not need root access
to install it.

@_subject: Re: Using crypt() 
Far from bulletproof, but the three Unice I just checked, SCO Unix, UnixWare and FreeBSD, all generate 13 character encrypted passwords.
I believe this is the norm for crypt.
Very few people around here have 13 character clear text passwords,
those that do are either very security concious and won't use CRYPT-PW
or it's just coincidental and their bad luck.
Anyway, requiring the supposedly encrypted password to be 13 characters
is probably about the best you can do.  If crypt generated recognizable
patterns it wouldn't be very useful, would it?
I'm still debating whether or not to allow our clients to use this option.  We may require clients registering domains to pick up a copy of PGP first.

@_subject: Re: Is crypt(1) a prohibited export? 
SCO (and Novell, when it was selling Unix) both shipped libcrypt.a as a seperate product in their development systems.  Only US and Canadian customers are allowed to buy the library.  Programs statically compiled
with libcrypt appear to be OK, but furineers can't have API access to
this technology :)

The library includes the functions encrypt(3) and des_encrypt(3).  In the
US-Only version of the library each of these functions accepts a flag
value of 1 to indicate de-cryption, the export version ignores the flag,
decryption is disabled.
I should have said only US and Canadian customers can purchase the uncrippled
version of the library.

At Usenix 96 in San Diego it was pointed out that applets are an abberation.
This is a complete language designed to displace C++, Visual Basic and
other OO languages.  Thinking of Java as simpy a Web enhancement tool
is short sighted.
Personally it is more attractive than C++ for product development and
we are trying to get it on FreeBSD, SCO UnixWare and SCO OSR5.  Using Java for applets _only_ is like fucking your mother... Most of us are
not into it.

Even though Victor likes C++, I share his sentiment that a lot of
people would be happier with Unix if only the marketing forces hadn't
driven them into the clutches of the Dark Lord.
Since this has already degenerated into a religious argument (actually
it started as one), I'll throw this in
FreeBSD and/or NetBSD are the way to go.  Actual facts follow.
FreeBSD is "free"
  Just like Linux, you can get FreeBSD off the 'Net for free.
  You can also buy a CDROM for < 100USD, just like Linux.
FreeBSD has solid networking code
  Since it is built on 4.4BSD its TCP/IP implementation has had more
  bashing than anything else around.  It works. It's fast.
FreeBSD has source available
  If you want the full source, or just the kernel source, grab it.  If all you need is a running system, don't bother.  Most people don't need kernel or utility, e.g cat or ls, source.
FreeBSD has a *single* source
  This may seem to be a disadvantage to some.  But when the core team releases a new version of FreeBSD you can be certain that it has been
widely tested and is at worst a _small_ step forward, not backwards or
sideways.  It might even be a _big_ step forward.  If they disappear,
you still have the source (assuming it was important enough for you
to grab it).
For me it boils down to the networking code.  I need it to work reliably and fast.  FreeBSD delivers, Linux promises.
ObCrypto: pgpsendmail is a standard package with FreeBSD (and probably
Linux too :)

point for the short version.
