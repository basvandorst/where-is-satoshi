     I've heard of incidents where a group of people dressed in white
sheets hung other people with dark skin.  Not one of those
white-sheeted people snitched, in many cases.
     If you were limiting your assertion to crime over the net, I
suggest that the long, interesting history of confidence men is a
refutation.  Done correctly, in many cases the victim doesn't even
know he has been conned.

I recently moved to Portland, OR (any cypherpunks up here?), and
haven't yet unpacked all my books, but from memory one variation used
in the movie "Grifters" is:
     - Convince the mark that you have an undetectable method
       to make money from the stock market that, while technically
       illegal, "won't hurt anyone".
     - Get seed money from the mark to run the scam.
     - Stage a bust by the police and allow the mark to escape.
     - The mark feels lucky to have gotten away, the front man
       and faux police split the money.
It shouldn't be too hard to come up with ways of doing this on the
net, given ecash and the rest of the infrastructure.

     Your basic idea is excellent, so excellent in fact that you could
probably make some money by providing the service.  As a parent of a
soon-to-be netsurfer, I would be willing to pay more for an account
that gave me some control over my daughter's access than I would for a
standard netcom style account.  Let me know when such accounts are
     In the meantime, there is no need for force.  The immediate
reaction of "there ought to be a law" is a direct contradiction to the
net "policing itself".

     So long as the enforcement is limited to those who agreed to the
laws and goals, neither do I.  You are suggesting that it is
acceptable for these individuals to use force to make others accept
those goals.  Hardly "voluntary interaction between individuals".

     In the past I've seen mention of using extropian-list-style

this a possibility?

     Like the use of PGP, this may be due to the different tools in
use.  I read email using the vm package for emacs.  While I was on the
extropians list I found it very convenient to reply to the first
message of a topic I was not interested in, modify the address, and
enter the simple ::exclude message.  Other tools and environments
could make this more difficult.

     Regarding (b), why wouldn't reputation be as important to "Murder
Escrows R Us" as to "Meat-and-Potatoes Escrow"?  Certainly the smaller
market will result in higher charges for customers of MERU, but I
don't see a qualitative difference in operation.
     Also, there is no reason for MAPE to know that they are paying a
killer.  The escrow could be set up to pay off or refund when a
trusted certification agency instructs MAPE to do so.  It might be
possible to spread the pieces around such that no one agent is aware
that they are participating in a murder for hire.

     This is a risk the customer is taking.  I'd make sure to only
hire killers certified by the Assassin's Guild, just as I'd only use
an escrow agency certified by people I trust.  I don't see this as a
service that is sufficiently different in _kind_ to require protocols
not required by other (pseudo)anonymous businesses.

     I'm interested in your solution.  Mine is to set up the escrow
payment seperately from the verification.  The escrow agent would
release the funds when instructed to do so by a specified verification
agent.  This eliminates the risk of the escrow agent keeping the money
without losing reputation.
     Now, the verification agent knows that it is certifying that a
murder took place and could collude with the escrow agent to split the
money, or with the victim's insurer to get a reward, etc.  This agent
would have to be paid by both the contractor and contractee,
regardless of outcome, to remove incentive to collude with the person
paying the fee.
     Therefore, the profit from collusion must be less than the cost
of the loss of reputation.  If one makes the assumption that such
agencies will not care about reputation, such arrangements are
impossible.  I question this assumption.
     Also, escrow agents will not deal with known hit verifiers, so
the entity that runs such a service must also run a legitimate
verification service or have a method for funneling verifications
through a legitimate service.

     I agree (please punch holes in my proposed scenario).  I don't
know how to provide such a proof.  The hit verification agent will
have to attend a lot of autopsies and funerals.
