@_subject: Appropriate bit of poetry 
We need to get off the snake/tentacle thing (and *I* am not
a tentacle).  To start getting us off the subject, I have an
appropriate eecummings poem:
when serpents bargain for the right to squirm
and the sun strikes to gain a living wage-
when thorns regard their roses with alarm
and rainbows are insured against old age
when every thrush may sing no new moon in
if all screech-owls have not okayed his voice
-and any wave signs on the dotted line
or else an ocean is compelled to close
when the oak begs permission of the birch
to make an acorn-valleys accuse their
mountains of having altitude-and march
denounces april as a saboteur
then we'll believe in that incredible
unanimal mankind(and not until)
                e.e.cummings
This, and more, poetry is available from ocf.berkeley.edu
in the /pub/Library/poetry directory.

@_subject: Re: REAL WORLD ENCRYPTION 
Well Sandy, I plan to use these tools we've developed.  I use PGP on
a regular basis (my public key is available on most of the key servers
or my .plan) for encryption of mail and sensitive source.  I do not
sign my messages, nor do I collect everyone else's keys -- for the
bulk of the things I do, it is pointless.
Encrypted phones, remailers, and such are of little use to me.  Stego
could be usefull, but I have not had the opportunity to necessitate it.
Stealth PGP?  Sure -- it's a good idea, but anyone can strip the
"Begin PGP data block" messages.
My life does not depend on the cryptographic techniques we hvae
developed.  I would hate for -anyone- to have to depend on the work
of others so much.  If I needed, I would install a new vresion of
sendmail to automatically encrypt all outgoing/local mail; I would
use the encrypted filesystems; I would use the encrypted cores that
someone has proposed.  But -- nothing I do right now needs that
sort of security.
Of course not!  If we wouldn't use a digital bank, then who in the
regular public would?  What they don't realize is that most of the
banking now adays is electronic and just the same as the digital banks
we have discussed.  I would open an account in a digital bank on a
few conditions:
1)	The currency could be tendered elsewhere.  I hate the "tokens"
that arcades and casinos use.  If I can't use the money I store in
the digital bank for something other than "digital postage," then it
is of no use to me.
2)	I would have some insurance that my "money" is safe and that
I can retrieve it at any time.  Just like the FDRC insures member banks,
I would like some digital version of that.  Will all the banks have
separate currencies?  Or will there only be one master bank with slaves
across the net?
regulating encryption.  Banks and finaces, I have no problem with, but
cryptography really scares me.  Why do they want to be able to read my
love letters (or my seditions email, or anything else of mine)?  Most
of my files are 0755 anyway, so they are free to read them.
with and the other users on my machines have their umask set to 7077.
Why?  What do they have to hide? I leave my umask at 7022 and only
chmod go-rx on the files I don't want anyone else to read.  With
encryption, it is just one step further.
Sure -- just as long as someone is listening.
