I'm sure this is the case in law, but to take an analogy,
this is like banning employees from *receiving* private telephone
calls. (Email has zero marginal cost to most institutions, as
does a telephone connection). While I am sure there are a few
employers who do ban staff from taking calls at work, I'd
think of them in the "Gradgrind and Gradgrind plc" class and
not expect them to keep their staff long. In fact, I know of few
employers who in practice object to reasonable use of the
phones to *make* personal calls. (The government is an exception,
although the UK defence ministry just worked out that 25% or
so of their phone bill was to private numbers, which may herald a

Do juries get to decide on points of law and create precedents in the
US legal system?
No wonder you have such odd laws. In the UK, legal argument is taken by the
judge in the absence of the jury, (and in most civil cases there
is no jury anyway -- I think that we only have juries in criminal cases and
libel, but someone more knowledgable may be able to correct this). Anyway,
the role of the jury is to decide on the facts e.g: A says X, B says Y,
who do we believe?
Also, the ability of judges in lower courts to create precedents is restricted.
A case like Microsoft v Stac would end up going right up through the
appeal process.

When Sendmail gets a mail to an unknown user (e.g. nobody
it will reject the mail. The relaying mailer is then supposed to bounce the
mail back to the author.
So if we forge the From: line, the mail should bounce back to the bogus
target. If I forge a mail as follows:
 From: cypherpunks
 To: nobody_at_all
 ------blah blah blah-----
It should bounce and thus appear on the cypherpunks list, without a sender.
Of course, it will have paths, etc, which give the game away. What is needed to give 'Stealth' remailing is a mailer that when seeing a header
such as 'X-Bounce-Strip: 1' removes headers and sends body text only back.
This is a useful feature to reduce network bandwidth when bouncing mail,
and should be included in all sendmails (grin).

SA is effectively cancelled out by using differential GPS
(Using a correction transmitter to send out differences
between GPS as-reported position and actual position).
However, any 'home made cruise missile' would need to
be fairly slow moving and manoevring. One of the features
of p-Code is support for 'high-dynamic' vehicles.
I've been away from the navigation field for some years,
so others may know more. Does the Russian Glonass system
have SA?

If the encryption method is any good, the output will be pseudo-random
with no digit being more frequent than any other. This certainly applies
to IDEA and DES. With RSA, you usually have a random (IDEA) session key
encrypted using the senders private key. This will also be an effectively
'random' number.
This would only work for ciphers that are effectively 'broken'. Also, many
packages and users compress data before encryption. Compression algorithms
work by removing patterns from data, so the resultant compressed plaintext
becomes fairly random anyway, removing the utility of frequency analysis.

@_subject: Internet, spamming, etc. 
In theory, yes. However, almost all Internet protocols are TCP/IP based.
The receiver of a TCP connection can choose not to accept
the connection, or to drop it at any time. The window protocol
keeps the sender from transmitting faster than any part of
the connection can manage. (How do you think ftp transfers
between sites with disparate connection speeds would work otherwise?)
One could theoretically have a package that sprayed UDP packets
at a particular IP address, or even have a modified TCP
that ignored disconnects. I think most service providers
would regard using such code as being on a par with running
a program that tried to telnet sequentially to all known IP
addresses, trying common passwords on each.

No doubt it does. But my assertion is that most service providers
would cut you off if you tried running such code, especially
the latter case.

Not actually true. It was because US banks were
subject to statutory limits on the amount of interest
they could pay on dollar deposits.
Banks are intrinsically insecure. All banks are subject to
the "sawn-off shotgun" attack, also the "kidnap the
managers family" attack and several others.
Why do you think that? Certainly it's compartmentalism
is better than UNIX, and as a "ground-up" design it's
probably seen better QA than UNIX. However, it hasn't had
20 years of interest from hackers and others. Also, while
the NT kernel may be *better*, several subsystems have
all the problems of UNIX, e.g. TCP/IP and the sequence
number attack.
I like NT, but it will never be a security panacea.

Actually, all GSM phones use a smart card to ID the subscriber.
There was at one point the idea that this card would be useful
for other things, e.g. you could plug it into a fixed line
phone and have that phone take on your personal number, or even
use it as a payment card. However, the desire for ever smaller
phones means that the credit card form factor is dying out for SIM
cards, and one doesn't want to keep popping a 0.5" x 1" mini-SIM
out of the bowels of the phone.
GSM uses less than strong encryption, by the way. I forget the
technical details, but it is of the level that governments can
fairly readily crack, but beyond the reach of most private
organisations. (So no more 'Squidgy-gate'). It would, however,
be quite feasible to add additional second stage encryption
to phones (since the dataflow is digital point-point). I wonder
if Nokia, a Finnish company well outside the scope of COCOM,
might offer a feature like this.
Incidentally, is there likely to be any adoption of GSM
in the US in the near future?
