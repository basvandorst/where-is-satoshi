@_subject: Identical Password and Member ID 
Dear Joe,
Our records show that your Expedia account contains a member ID and
password that are identical.  While we understand that this makes it
simpler for you to remember them, we are now asking our members to
create passwords that do not match their member ID's.  We appreciate
your assistance in this small change, which increases the security of
your account.
You can change your password by following these steps:
1.  Access your Expedia Member Information
 2.  Click Continue on the Expedia sign in screen.
3.  If prompted, enter current member ID and password, and then click
4.  Click Continue on the secure sign in screen.
5.  Follow instructions for section labeled 3 of 6: Password.  6.  Click Continue.
Thank you for using Expedia.  Please feel free to contact us if you have
any questions.
