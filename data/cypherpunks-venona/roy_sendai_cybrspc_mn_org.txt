First off, thanks for passing this along.  Ms. Denning's comments have
some, shall we say, disturbing implications in re this "target system".
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Somehow, it's not surprising that the current implementation must be
told explicitly to forget a key.  I wonder how many keys a decryptor can
remember at a time, as well.
But the "target system" references are even more sinister.  They seem to
describe an online system for retrieving and using escrowed keys.  Such
a system might be viewed as the data equivalent of the FBI's Digital
Telephony initiative.  And as we all know, where there is an online
connection, there may be a vulnerability.  Remembering that escrow
release will need only an affadavit claiming that a court order exists,
how susceptible to spoofing will the system be?  And if it's on the
Internet (which is, after all, the Highway 101 of the NII), will the
promiscuous packet sniffers be able to snag Clipper Keys on their way to
the spooks?

This is the way to go.  Serial port real estate is way too scarce in the
average PC.  Besides, this approach makes the design easier and has
another advantage...
Yes, this can be a real problem.  So design the card such that the noise
source runs continuously at a high speed, and feeds an 8-bit shift
register.  Place a latch on the output of the register, and set up
decoding logic to read the latch in a memory-mapped port position.
Ports are available, if you look and plan around the popular ones (such
as UARTs, soundblasters, CD-ROM cards, etc.).  You'll want to make it
configurable to several possible ports.  This design assures that each
random byte can only be read once.  A TSR couldn't read the card in
parallel (because reading a port doesn't require hooking an interrupt),
so the only way to compromise it is to subvert the application reading
the card.  Conventional anti-virus protection can see to it that the app
remains trustworthy.
I hack both.  Hardware is fun!

The card design isn't so much security as avoiding scarce real estate on
a PC (which, at somewhere over 130 million units fielded, is a not
inconsiderable market segment).  If this were a dongle device, I'd want
it on a parallel port.  Many machines don't have a spare serial port,
and transparent dongles would be harder to do there, anyway.  But
transparent parallel port dongle technology is already established.

In list.cypherpunks, tcmay:
It's not true.  The MD5 hash of the plaintext is used as a part of the
overall session key generation, if available.  Here's a comment from
    /*  Now we have to generate a random session key and IV.
        As part of this computation, we use the MD5 hash of the
        current file, if it has previously been obtained due to a
        signing operation.  If it has not been obtained, we hash
        the first 2K (for efficiency reasons) for input into
        the key generatrion process.  This is to ensure that
        capturing a randseed.bin file will not allow reconstruction
        of subsequent session keys without knowing the message
        that was encrypted.  (A session key only protects a
        single message, so it is reasonable to assume that an
        opponent trying to obtain a session key is trying to
        obtain, and thus is ignorant of, the message it encrypts.)
        This is not perfect, but it's an improvement on how session
        keys used to be generated, and can be changed in future
        without compatibility worries.
    */
The hash of the current file is combined with the contents of
randseed.bin.  Looks like the hash value is being used to gain a few
bits of entropy that can't be recovered from randseed.bin alone.
Checking the 2.6 code, I find the MD5 of the current file is used in the
random session key generation, but slightly differently:
 * The MD5 of the current file is used to "prewash" the random numbers,
 * to make it more difficult for an attacker to predict the output.
If the key were solely hashed from the plaintext, that could make for
some known-plaintext attacks.  But since a new session key is used each
time, there doesn't seem to be much value in it.  As it is, I don't see
a problem with the session key generation using the file hash as a part
of its entropy.
Then again, could an IDEA session key be recovered by a known-plaintext
attack?  If so, could a known-plaintext attack then be made against RSA?
(for that matter, is RSA vulnerable at all to known-plaintext attack?)

Widespread home banking would give the Con a real good window into not

When you add in debit-card transactions at the supermarket, you have
pretty much a microscopic picture of a person (including a fair estimate

goes).  I'm sure the electronic banking being done even now is harvested
for statistical data.  (And I'm having real second thoughts about the
bank-by-phone service where I've toned in my account number and ATM PIN.
I have no guarantee that my phone line is secure.)
Preemptive deployment has to be the answer.  Just like strong crypto
everywhere else, get the product out there.  What we need (and probably
don't have a chance in hell of getting) is a regional bank to step out
and make cryptographically secure home banking available.  If it were
me, I'd hit everywhere... telephone modem links, Internet connection
(yeah, I know... trendy, but an effective attention-getting device) and
some kind of interactive cable system.  If one bank does it, and sells
the crypto security hard, the others will have to follow suit for

misc.test provides much better response.

trying to spam penet in the original sense, by trying to overrun
arbitrary limits in the server)
That leaves outing as the motive.  Now I'm wondering if the idea is to
out as many people as possible, or if the perp is searching for
a particular party or parties.  The formation of the messages (from

@_subject: US Should Forbid Export of Digital Wiretap Technology (fwd) 
comp.society.privacy yields the following from crawford
(Mike Crawford).  I _think_ it's black humor, but the moderator of c.s.p
seems to have accepted it at face value.
The United States Congress is considering bills to require telephone
equipment manufacturers to make their equipment easy to wiretap.
While the Digital Telephony bills (H.R 4922 and S. 2375) may concern to
Americans who worry that the government will overstep its legal
authority to tap phone calls, it presents a truly horrifying prospect
to the citizens of many other countries.
Many countries, perhaps most countries, make no pretense of
guaranteeing their citizens due process.  In such countries, equipment
that met the standards required by this bill would be a powerful weapon
of political repression.
Further, even democratic governments may use such equipment to spy on
the offices of American companies doing business in their countries.
I suggest that the bill be amended, so that in the event that it does
pass, to require strict export controls over equipment that is "wiretap
At the very least, wiretap-ready equipment should be controlled as
rigorously as the export of military weapons.  I assert that the
controls should be tighter - we should only allow export to countries
that have legal protections that are at least as rigorous as required
in the US, and also that really enforce such laws.  Further, we should
require evidence of long-term stability to avoid the possibility that a
democratic government will be overthrown by a totalitarian regime that
will then use our technology to evil ends.  Wiretap ready equipment
could even destabilize democratic governments, if the governments are
unable to prevent political opponents or insurgents from covertly using
the wiretapping system.
Such export rules should be closely monitored by Congress.  History
shows that the administrative branch often bends the rules to favor
foreign policy convenience over human rights.  For example, the Reagan
and Bush administrations routinely refused political asylum to citizens
of El Salvador, even when such refugees had credible reason to fear
murder at the hands of the death squads.
A possible solution would be for Congress to  authorize export to
particular countries for only a year or two at a time.  Each year the
relevant committee could take testimony from the State department,
business groups, and international human rights organizations, and pass
a bill to allow export to the qualifying countries.
Consider that high-tech wiretaps are in some ways more dangerous than
bullets or bombs.  Once a bomb has exploded, it is not dangerous
anymore.  A national phone system with built-in monitoring system would
last for many years, even outlasting the governments and corporations
that originally installed them.
If America really stands for liberty, we will take great care before
unleashing this weapon on the world.
If you agree with me, call or fax your Senators and Representatives.
Suggest they introduce this amendment.  I also suggest that special
attention be paid to such people as Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who leads
Congress in the effort to hold the People's Republic of China, and
other legislators with an interest in the human rights climate in other

Fingerprints, yes.  Floppies, perhaps not.  At the least, it means you
have to have hardware on site and someone has to work swapping floppies.
I've done a signing where we all send out keys to one person.  He
distributes a keyring to all participants. Then we meet, exchange
fingerprints in person, take the prints home and sign in private.
All the participants mail their keys back to the collector, who
returns a keyring with all keys, properly signed.  I always hand out my
Certified Computer Geek[tm] card, which has only email addresses, web

You are incorrect.  Keys can always be obtained, and signatures can be
verified at any time.  But an unsigned message can _never_ be verified
as to its origin.
You may not have my key, but I still sign this message (as I have signed
all my net traffic for over 3 years).  I do this to protect the
reputation capital I've built up.
Sheesh, yourself, Nathaniel (if that _is_ your True Name).  You're
showing a real attitude here, as though your reputation alone should be
enough to convince us of your messages' validity.  A malicious attacker
would be likely to bluster this way to deflect discovery of hir ruse.

And not just from the rest of us.  Your model is a malicious program

If all my malicious program does is sniff keystrokes, FV accounts are
less vulnerable.  So I'll make my malicious program not only sniff
keystrokes, but I'll hook your Winsock stack and intercept the POP3
queries.  That way, I can catch the FV verification messages and confirm
them.  You'll never see anything happen.
So I'll get my malicious program to look for blocks of seemingly random
data from the keyboard (where many swipe systems wedge in) or the com
ports not used by mouse and modem.  (on a PC platform, that's not likely
since heroic measures are needed to run more than 2 com ports)  Unless
seeded by the transaction, these blocks should be vulnerable to a replay
Smart cards may not be vulnerable to replay attacks, so you may be
correct here.
Or the site initiating the transaction is recognizable, prompting the
malicious program to take notice.  And since I've hooked all your net
services, I can steal your coins easily... the transactions you send
will never reach their destination.
The "fatal flaw" here is that you haven't extended your threat model to
its logical conclusion.  If you assume a malicious program with access
to the keyboard at the hardware level, that program could also access
and manipulate the TCP/IP stack, as well as data flowing to/from
networked applications of all sorts.
I only see one approach that's safe from local eavesdropping, and FV
isn't it.

Could you characterize the failure modes?  I see 2 main ones:
    Confirmation notices directed to another address invisible to the
    successfully infiltrated attacker.
    Failure to initially infiltrate:
        Infiltration attempt failed.
        Potential victim never contacts infection vector.
I'm curious how you'd estimate the breakdown over these modes, and if
you see additional failure modes I've missed.

First of all, I note to the list that I have exchanged some email with
IPGsales, whence this reference comes.  I had hoped there would be
enough integrity in IPGsales that sie would note the difference between
private mail and mail to the list.
The gist of my mail has been that IPGsales likes to redefine accepted
terms of art to their own benefit.  I didn't (and don't) define what a
one time pad is.  I simply noted that PRNG-based systems are not one time
pads, and asked that IPGsales refrain from mislabeling their system as

promoting a system using plainly incorrect terminology.  IMHO, this
choice of terminology speaks volumes about the crypto expertise (or lack
thereof) they have brought to the table.
Consider it, then, a response in kind to your own unadulterated bull.
I'll guess here that my refusal to accept IPGsales' new definitions for
accepted terms has been taken as 'excluding myself'.  So be it.  Perhaps
IPGsales is miffed that I said I would advise my clients against their

about to trust my key generation to people who can't even get basic
technical terms correct, much less trust them not to send copies of the
keys offsite to the NSA^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H for disposal.  (recall that
IPGsales said no copies of the keys were retained _by them_)

I believe it's disclaimer time.
I have entered into no agreements to inspect, test or validate the IPG

shall not inspect, test or offer opinions regarding the security of this

contributing to the claim of validation.  This action is intended to
guard against claims of the form "roy has been
unable to break our system", among others.

terms, but be advised that I'm somewhat expensive.

I've suggested this before, but it bears repeating that any truly secure
cryptosystem depends _only_ on the secrecy of the key.  The algorithm
should be able to be published in the New York Times with no compromise
to the security of the system.  If this is not the case for your system,
than perhaps you should be considering alternative entrepreneurial
