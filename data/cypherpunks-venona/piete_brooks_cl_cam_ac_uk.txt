combinations) so I inlined getopts.pl, and changed the comments, but left
the first part of the sentance -- the "if you have no getopts" was omitted.

There are new versions of brloop and brclient which might cope better with
problems with the transatlantic link -- you should use brc0.09 and brl0.03
All the better -- your machine will have more cycles for CRACKing !

The code expects brclient to return one line which is the comamnd line flags

The purpose of this project was the latetr ...
That is just one of the tweaks I made ...
Indeed -- the current project is a merge of three I had planned ...
Yeah .... :-)
This project arose from the "failed" rc4-40 attempt.
Personally I think it worked -- it showed that it was possible to scan a 40 bit address space performing the kind of manipulations needed for brute force The WWW interface was a pain as it required users to do something, so the norm was to allocate large chunks, etc.
Also collating the results was a nightmare !
So we decided that cutting the people out would be a good idea all round.
We bolted it all together, and it seemed kind of OK.
The plan was then to pass it round a wider audience to check that it ported to other systems and environments, and once it was shown to bsasically work, see how it stood up to heavy usage. Finally we could let it rip & see what it could do.
Unfortunately, due to various external pressures, we have ended up rolling all these three into one. It has made it a lot messier than I would have hoped, for which I apologise to you all.
rc4-40 had shown that 40bit address spaces could be scanned.
hal1 slipped through our fingers, and showed somewhat more than we had planned, i.e. that actual code could be broken by a *single* person (this sounds more impressive, but is technically easier !).
We asked for hal2 and hal3 to "check it works" and "watch it zip" repectively.
Before he left, Hal gave us hal2, so we combined the two remaining stages.
SO: this project is:
    1) to shake down the code on different systems
    2) to see how it works under real load
    3) to see how quickly a 40bit address space can be scanned.
Again I apologise to you all that (1) has been non-trivial and that (2) has had unpleasant effects of (1). I think next time we may be ready for (3) ...
I was going to summarise some of the lessons so far, but things are getting congested again, so I shall send out this PLEA to ensure recent code is used !!
current requirements
PLEASE ensure that you are using a brclient of at least 0.14
("grep comment.inffo brclient" to discover what you are using)
You can updare brclient while brloop is running.
Some people are still running old versions, and this is hammering the server.
It also helps to run at least brloop 0.05 ("grep BRLOOPCOMMENT brloop").
What to do if you have logs
During the early part of the project, the server was highly congested, and I fear that many ACKs may have been lost :-(
If you have logs of the searches your machine(s) did, it would be useful to check  that all ACKs got through.
Look at the stats page (or something like
but with YourID repleaced by the ID ypou use)
and look for all the NOACKs. e.g:
See if there is a corresponding entry in your logs
and if so, ACK it
[ If your a HACKer, you can automate it, as in

Sorry about that -- someone misconfigured their system and walked through the address sspaxce asking for ranges (size 3) and then discarding them and asking for more.
I wasn't really expecting such small holes, so kept the allocation code REAL SIMPLE -- it give the user *upto* the requested amount from the first chunk.
I see this is a bit of a bummer for you :-((
I may tweak it to look in subsequent blocks ....
As I said earlier, phase (1) and (2) are upsetting phase (3) ...
Basically the WWW interface was calling the SKSP interface and wedging.
WWW then used up all its permitted processes, so the WWW server died.
[[ PERL gurus out there: how can I avoid the "sh -c" process in
I have freed the ACK blockage, and made the allocate code not try quite so hard, and now our WWW server is back in the land of the living.
The SKSP server is still seeing null sessions which time out after half a minute -- a bit of a bummeer :-(
The hosts concerned are decent citizens most of the time (I think ...)
"|23" means "23 seconds after the call started". Any ideas ?

No -- it means that you were taking too long to respond, so it timed you out.
brclient -k failed to get any keys, so brutessl didn't generate any output,
so brclient -A didn't get any input :-(
Latest brloop should avoid this by not calling brutessl if brclient -k failed
and also not calling brclient -A if brutessl didn't run / failed.
Well, the problem with brclient 0.16 was that a "go faster" stripe made it
go *too* fast if local, perl losses data, so it times out :-((

My stats is *very* rusty, but I'd have thought it would be somewhat less than twice a linear search ...
However, I agree that as a ballpark figure, yes: it would be somewhere between N/2 and N ...
IMPLEMENTATION !
random probing does indeed have its merits.
Personally I'd go for a scheme whereby on finishing a random search, the client multicast a PGP signed message (there would be a WWW/email/telnet/... interface which would multicast for our non-connected members) allowing interested parties
1) to gather stats as to what actually happened
2) maps of "unsearched" areas to be built by anyone wanting to fill gaps
3) the "big boys" could learn to trust each other and use (2).
4) when all notified keys are tried, go in to killer mode, and try to find
   who is untrustworthy.  Someone can only try it once, and getting a "big boy"
   tag takes a while, and a lot of CPU cycles !
Convince me (please) ....
What size "chunks" should be scanned ?
See above ... the big boys will do it eventually ...
It has its advantages -- yes. Did you use it for Hal1 ?  :-))

You can't use the random method if the CRACK is using a sequential search.
It just doesn't fit !
You can't ACK something which has not been allocated to you.
However, if a CRACK were to be using random, the above would be useful as a
"progress report" as the rate of reports indicates how well the search is
It would also allow more equal sharing out of the prize money, as on
average 2**15 "possible" keys would be found, and the first finder of each
would receive a fraction of the prize.
I don't know enough of the theory -- is there any limit as to how many
"partial" matches there could be in a single "segment" ?
(currently brure{ssl,rc4} stops on finding a match. They would have to keep
 going, and might have to return upto 2**16 partial results ??

No -- that is the preferred way, but you can use a network connection

process it offline, and then report back your findings later.

Indeed, it does, and we plan to provide a "local CPU farm" server
which can be used when a number of machine are sharing the same ID.
No -- but that the early version of the code were buggy.
As it is, 6 clients which are still running are managing to keep the
server permanently busy.
I think the protocol itself is OKish ..
Not really.
It did however mean that when a chunk was allocated, three times as
much work was done !
Hmm -- hard to tell -- the *server* can take lots, but if the
*clients* have problems, things go wrong.
A select/poll server is not going to be tried on the next one -- that'll only
be used if that goes slow as well ...
The latest version of brloop starts with a call of "brutessl -q -t 1"
to decide how big the chunks should be ...
I suspect that figures would be too crude ...
The server would have to keep track of clients and how long their
sessions take ....
Should a client which takes 20s for a session be given blocks that take
20 times longer to process than one which manages it in 1s ?
Sorry -- what does that mean ?
Sorry -- I'm lost ...
I've split allocation from ACKs.
One server just doles out keys, the other just collects the ACKs.
I don't want to add that sort of realtime feedback.
What do you do about WWW clients ?
What if someone grabe a big chunk, farms it out to several machines,
and they ACK bits back ... ?
Again no realtime fedback from ACKs :-(
That'll come -- as the WWW pags says. pelase let me know what stats you'd like.

Indeed !
This is why brclient and brloop are two separate programs ..
(those who don't care about security can run "brclient -Ubrutessl -tssl | sh"
 (for a demo, type "brclient -Ubrutessl -tsslck")
 BUT it means that the SKSP server could run any command on your system!
Users should read brclient (and make me blush !) to show that there are no
trapdoors. Then they should read brloop and convince themselves that whatever
data is returned by brclient, no rogue command will be run.
(this is why brloop is written in sh rather than perl -- I assume more people
 read sh than perl ...
Note that brclient and brloop do not do any file I/O (so can be chroot'ed, etc)
and apart from "pretties" (such as calling hostname / uname -n to generate an
ID) brclient doesn't exec any other commands, so all you need provide are those
used by brloop (I think sed and head).
If anyone cares to build a "cell" in which to run it, please let me know.
However, I fear that it might be somewhat machine specific.
One problem is that the more recent brloop starts by asking "which servers
shoudl I use" unless they are explicitly set -- this means that you either need
to wire down the host to call (e.g. a local SKSP "local CPU farm" server),
or allow it to make an outgoing call to *ANY* host on port 19957 (well, you
might care to disable access to your local network, 127.* etc).
I've been waiting, but not heard any yet :-))
After my experiences of a handfull of old clients killing the server for
everyone, I plan to circumvent the problem by causing rogue brloop's to exit.
Sure -- auto update would be nice, but until the padded cell above is

... and maybe based on a false premis ?
The load was very *LOW*.
The problem was that the single threaded server was spending most of its time
talking to clients which failed to complete their interactions, and timed out.
The earlier client "ACK" code didn't hang around long enough, and gave up.
Later code kept trying ....
Nope -- basic fault here !! TCP not UDP !!
Not the case.
It uses a reliable bytestream, and the client does not consider a keyspace
ACKed until it get back the "OK" response from the server.
This makes it "at least once", but that isn't a problem.
It does, in the reliable bytestream ...
As above -- "at least once" -- it just retries.
brclient waits a bit and tries again, before asking for the next.

@_subject: Re: Pre-allocating key segments 
I'd prefer to keep the number of segments "lost" if a brloop ceases.
I have written a "local CPU farm" caching server which runs on a robust
machine and grabs chunks from the root server and farms them out to local
machines (running as the same "ID").
This logs all the client transactions so that you can work out if any keys were
allocated to machines which failed to ask for another segment -- you should
assume that that segment was not searched.
With the Big Boys using that, and better code, I hope that server congestion
will not be a problem.
That means that if it crashes, 8 segments are left unACKed :-(

@_subject: Re: SSL trouble 
Well, imagine my suprise  ....  [[ reference to ISIRTA ]]
One of the things that the latest brloop does is make a call to the master
server asking for a list of servers to contact :-))
Note that it is a list, and it tries them in order (all A RRs).
Currently just all the "allocate" transactions -- I haven't written my
ACK reflector yet, so all ACKs go direct th the ACK master.
No -- the slaves will not "be delegated" (as in pre-assigned address space),
they will just ask the master for it as they need it.
Sure, the'll do it in reasonable sized chunks, but not (2**16)/16 ....
Nah - results still go direct pro tem.
You got it !
(slave -> slaves I assume)
Yup -- code sharing !
Well, not even that !
The slaves don't have the config file with the key info in it ...
BUT ....
These cache servers are asking for non trivial amounts of keyspace.
As such there should not be *too* many, and then need to be "managed" ...
If one crashes, the logs need to be scanned to see how to restart it (so that
it starts by doling out the segments that it had no sub-doled to its clients).
Indeed -- that's how it was designed ...
However, note that with big cache servers (as opposed to Local CPU Farm servers
where all clients are the same "ID") reports of sub-allocation have to be
passed back to the root :-(
Indeed -- the Local CPU Farm cache server is just about ready for ALPHA testers
Done ...
Yeah -- but being based on C, C++ didn't stand much chance ...
... but better than C++ -- sure.
PS1: PERL gurus: Anyone know how to test whether there is input waiting on a

I'm seeing calls from calpoly.edu and albany.net taking less than a second.
Are you **REALLY** worried about wasting that sort of time, when even a single

I don't think a second's overhead (practical with local cache) is significant.
Sure, but I'd prefer you allocate single segments .....
[ Getting down to the implementation details
  1) it would be hard for brloop to know that brutessl is 3/4s done.
  2) I can't think how to do prefetching in a safe way, and without disc use
If you gave me code which would guess how long the request for the next
segment will take, and then know when brutessl is that many milliseconds from
completion, and can tell that brloop isn't going to die within that time,
sure :-))
If someone supplies info for my "PS3:", I can generate central stats on what
%age of Hal3 was wasted waiting on the server.
Otherwise, brloop users will have to scan their own logs (if enabled) and work
it out (latest brloop happens to log when brutessl starts and finishes).

There is not "a" list ...
The list returned will be "tailored" for the calling host.
Thus an EU host will have EU sites near the front, AU hosts will have AU
servers, etc ...
(Well, maybe they'll just be returned in a random order !).
By having multiple A RRs for a name, the DNS will do the pseudo load balancing.
Indeed -- as above:
1) optimise the list so that "near" servers are used.
2) cycle the servers
3) leave it to the DNS to SHUFFLE.
Yup -- but if it's just "random", I'd probably use a single name ...
Well, the current implementation will give what it has left, then on restarting
the main loop it notices that it has no keys left, so asks the main server for
more, so if the clients aren't all bunched up, it'll pre-fetch more segments,
so there's a fair chance the client won't have to wait :-))
I can always add some more A RRs to sksp-ack to load balance ...
Possible ....
I've had various offers to host a server ...
At a cost ....
Either it has to save state in a form that's easy to reload later,
or save state in a way that it can spend some time before it starts to
Loss of what info ?
Running brutessl's will call brclient to report the ACK.
They will report back the data as normal -- nothing to do with the Allocate
Slave -- even if it were, it would auto fallback to another server.
brloop's will ask for another keyspace, and on finding that the first server
on its list doesn't respond, it'll try the next server on its list, and if
none respond, it'll wait a bit and start asking again ...
Well, I use a multiplicative backoff within limits ....
Indeed -- how long ?
Well, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 300, 300, ...
Well, 5 mins ... < 1/3 or a segment ...
Yes -- I do -- so that it's possible to tie up requests and ACKs.
Yup -- that's what an ACK reflector will do.
Note that Allocation and ACKs are separate ....

No -- If you ask for 2 segments, then when you are 50% done, it is OK to ACK the *FIRST* segment.
I thought of that, but:
1) for the same server load, it doubles the number of unACKed segments
2) if process A is lagging process B, then when process B finishes and is idle
   waiting for the server, process A will run faster and thus reduce the lag.
   This will make the processes drift into phase.

Plug, caveat, etc
To enable "lone" security reseachers (i.e. not enough people in the dept to have regular Security Seminars) in the UK to "keep in touch", we transmit our departmental Security Seminars on the MBone each week, with a low TTL and administratively scoped to the UK (so we don't have to worry about clashing with other events. The AC.UK MBone is fully pruning, and typically has spare These are not big formal events, but typically have a dozen or two members of the department and other "locals" present.
The termly program is available on the Web in under "Security seminars" [ That way you can see our more formal "Departmental Seminars" listing at the same time :-) ]
It's run as a "DIY" service (i.e. members of the group set things up) so things may go amiss. However, if they do (or there are time zone problems) it is fairly simple to retransmit later (during UK office'ish hours -- unless someone has some magic to start up vat and vic or nv without using X) from the tape we make ...

      PROBLEMS OF STREAM CIPHER GENERATORS WITH MUTUAL CLOCK CONTROL
    The speaker has been looking at the cycle structure of an algorithm
    posted just over a year ago on the Internet and alleged to be the
    secret A5 algorithm used for confidentiality in the GSM mobile
    telephone system. This algorithm employs three mutually
    clock-controlled shift registers, and can fairly quickly enter a
    loop with what is essentially the shortest possible period, a
    number very small compared with the total number of states, or even
    its square root. Moreover this behaviour is robust, not being
    influenced by factors such as choice of primitive feedback
    polynomial or even clocking logic (with a proviso to be
    discussed).  A fairly straightforward explanation for this
    behaviour has been found. Some ways of getting around the problem
    of excessively short periods are considered, as well as the
    behaviour of systems with different numbers of mutually clocked
    registers. In particular a mention is made of the wartime T52e
    cipher, perhaps the inspiration for "alleged A5".
