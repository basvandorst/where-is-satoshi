@_subject: Antiautomobile devices 
This was recently posted to ba.motorcycle (WHY, I dunno), and since there
has already been the topic regarding EMP disabling of cars....
So, LEOs in the US of A will disable fleeing autos with electricity, eh? They
ought to get a clue from those icons of enforcement in Finland.
Finnish police agencies have been beta-testing a new device that fits on the
front of their police cars. It's a harpoon. That's right, a harpoon. During a
high-speed chase, the cops ram the sharpened, front-mounted device through
the body, into the trunk of the car they are chasing. Barbs spring out,
preventing dislodgement. The police car then uses its own brakes to bring
both cars to a halt. The kicker is that the harpoon is really a giant
hypodermic needle; tear gas can be injected through it into the vehicle
ahead. (I can just hear some lawn order types now: "Whoa! Cool, man!")
This story comes from the 8/20/96 broadcast of Public Radio International's
program, "The World", which claimed the device was being demonstrated at some
airport in Finland.
They didn't say what would happen if the suspects decided to lock up their
brakes just as the pursuing vehicle rammed them, but they *did* advise
listeners to obey all speed limits while visiting the country....:-)
This is why I like my new bike...

But its not a matter of "giving it up", its more "not being given it."
There is little control with cash now, only some if the serial numbers are
prerecorded and watched for, and even then not to a paint where they can
come stomp on you before you walk out of the mall. But I agree, it is
unlikely that banks would pass up the opportunity, all in the name of
"loss reduction" and "profit through sharing of demographics"
