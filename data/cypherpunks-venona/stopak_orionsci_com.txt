@_subject: patented vs secret (was Re: RC4) 
Patented does not equal secret.  The argument against Clipper (at least one of them ;-), is that it has not been subjected to review outside of the NSA.
I believe the code for RC4 and RC2 is accessible and has been subjected to
review by many in the crypto field - you just can't use it legally without a license.
