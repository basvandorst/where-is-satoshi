That's why it may take close to a year -- perhaps until next summer -- for
Congress to finish compromising away your rights to use whatever encryption
software you like.
And next year *is* an election year. If nothing awful happens, it shouldn't be much of an issue, but sooner or later there'll be a big bang made by terrorists who've used crypto in the plotting, & then anyone who opposed the FBI line will get drubbed, perhaps fatally (i.e. they'll lose their seat). The single "best" reason for congresscritters to support GAK is CYA; supporting American business isn't a sufficient counterforce, especially when "big business" has become a dirty word for much of the American electorate, the affected companies seem to be doing damn well, & they aren't old pros at lobbying. Dead babies are more dramatic than annual reports (even if -- as we all know -- GAK will do little or nothing to prevent terrorism &c. Fairness counts for little in political campaigns...)
I agree with Declan -- obstructionism is the only way to go. Let's review the current situation:
a) Crypto know-how is globally distributed & impossible to annihilate.
b) There are no domestic US restrictions on encryption development or use.
c) There are onerous US restrictions of export of encryption software.
Hopefully, legislation can be delayed until foreign companies have widely deployed commercial strong crypto, & US companies are demonstrably (to the person in the street) feeling the pain. Then GAK will be obviously pointless and stupid. It'll cost US jobs, which hurts (me, as an American, most of whose friends are American), but it's the best we can hope for, I think.

On the other hand a publicized security disaster or "infowar" attack could spin things in the other direction.
Hmm... I assume hackers will attack the GAK infrastructure as soon as its begun. Terrorists or freedom fighters? You make the call.

I try to avoid "me too" posts, but I agree 100% with this. Somehow we have
to convince a bunch of legislators that technological solutions are
superior or legal ones in protecting info-privacy. Perhaps an analogy with
welfare might help (at least with conservative members): access to crypto
vs. laws protecting privacy is like private job creation vs. welfare. Do we
want to live in a state where we are mandated to rely on the government for
privacy (even if we could trust the government)?
Thanks also for the concrete example of how pedophiles could make use of a

Not sure where I stand on this. An OS is more like a highway than a car.
Or, better, a rail track -- since it imposes severe compatibility

Imagine that someone owned the rail track standard & had the exclusive
IP-rights to manufacture it. Non-standard tracks exist, but they don't go
nearly as many places. Then the company uses its position as owner of the

The problem is that this only makes the technological point that censorship
is increasingly difficult, not the political point that it's wrong -- that
NAMBLA has a right to publish their material. The technological point is
worth making, but -- particularly when the information has little inherent
value -- I believe the political point is more important. I'd like to avert
a society in which unpopular publications exist only by subterfuge. In
fact, a technological response may be negative in this case, inspiring
calls for greater controls, which, while they may fail to achieve their aim, would make life worse.
Anyway -- sign me up, Declan.

This makes you a Nazi-loving Jewish bitch. I concur in Monger's assessment
of you as a Dumb Cunt. To expand on this, nearly every position you take is
fascist -- to pick one at random, you accuse the American people of physical
flabbiness. Now, who -- in the nineteen-thirties -- abhorred such flabbiness
in the German people & made a show of public exercise rituals:
1. Jewish Intellectuals.
2. Nazis.
Not a coincidence, either. Sedentary activities include reading, discussion,
writing, &c. -- all abhorred by fascists. Yet you claim to oppose fascism.
Dumb cunt. & this is the most trivial example.
To a degree, true. But apply the principle to others: you know as little, or
less, about me than I know about you. Stop trying to dictate my life.

@_subject: RE: Microsoft's compelled speech, compelled marketing 
All of your examples are of antitrust actions *stopped* by political pressure. Of course, monopolies tend to have lots of cash, & that buys influence -- but this is just one more reason to bust them: the disproportion in economic power within the industry corrupts the political system.
There are plenty of ways government fucks with commerce & harms competition. I've seen little evidence that monopoly-busting has done anything but promote competition -- on the rare occasions it succeeds. & the less-rare occasions when the threat influences behavior.
Unlike Lizard, I'm genuinely self-interested. I'd hate to see what would become of the computer industry if Microsoft had no fear of the DoJ.
James & the Naderites ought to take a closer look at MS's Win98 strategy. IE4 is genuinely integrated into the OS, & new MS apps (e.g. Outlook 98) will share much of its code. This isn't bad in itself -- they launch quickly & run smoothly -- but it gives third-party developers a choice:
1) Also live off the IE4 code, making it nearly impossible to port your app to another OS.
2) Write independently & fight with the MS code for system resources. It can't be turned off.
It also makes running Navigator, in particular, ridiculous. You open a folder & bam! there's IE4. Netscape is right to focus on the backend.
Despite all that, I don't support breaking up MS. The industry is too in flux. MS isn't able to assure victory.

Really? I avoid associating with those who mow my laws. Ha ha.
Seriously, I've never lived in Sweden or Singapore -- if I do, I'll get back
to the list on which I prefer -- but I'm troubled by the tendency of
Libertarians to err on the side of big business fetishism rather than civil
liberties. Both are part of the Doctrine, of course*, but I often hear them
argue that wild-west capitalism inevitably leads to political freedom -- so,
not to worry -- but rarely that political freedom invariably leads to
laissez-faire capitalism (so, not to worry). You might say that the latter is NOT TRUE. Well, right-o, but neither is the
former. Economic progress under a fascist regime leads inevitably to
political freedom? You guys actually make this argument. *Yes, Libertarians criticize corporate welfare, but just because it corrupts
the notion that a person's entire worth can be summarized in a stock

@_subject: Re: Censorial leftists (Was: Interesting article) 
Don't lecture me. I said "political freedom" by which I mean the liberty to
speak, assemble, &c. I thought that was clear from the contextual reference
to "civil liberties". By the way, do you want the government to leave others alone as well? To
murder you, for example? Libertarians want a government capable of, &
focused on, protecting their interests -- just like everyone else*. The
question is: what *is* in my interest: long-term, thought-through, really? Many of those vastly empowered individuals *are* the government. Recall that
I wrote in opposition to the rosy scenario whereby economic progress
inevitably leads to political liberty. Here are a couple of other scenarios:
1) The progress collapses in the face of massive corruption. See Malaysia.
I'd be curious to know if you think this is more or less likely in a fascist
2) The government uses it's newfound technological & industrial capacity, &
taxbase, for nefarious purposes. See fascist Italy, Germany, Japan. Once
again, more or less likely in a fascist state?
I'm no opponent of economic or technological progress, that would be silly.
It engenders greater practical, not just theoretic, freedom (e.g. the
ability to speak globally), goodies are fun, & even basic liberty is much
more difficult to preserve when people are hungry. We can certainly agree on
that. I also oppose large portions of the U.S. government, its criminal &
regulatory structure. I'd like to see it move in the *direction* of
Libertopia. True, I wouldn't want to see it get there, but we can agree on
most short-term & mid-term issues.
But once again, articles like Declan's "hey, Singapore may be 'Disneyland
with the death penalty' but the trains sure run on time" piss me off. The
implied valuation miscalculates my interest, & Declan's also, in my opinion,
to the point of "brain rot," as Seth used to say**. Is a tax cut worth the
enormous increase in arbitrariness in an authoritarian state? Apparently, the Joos are responsible for the crisis in Malaysia. Or so the
Grand High Mystical Wizard who heads the country has suddenly decided. Wanna
live there?
As Libertarians point out, there's a huge difference between economic
pressure (e.g. to purchase Windows) & being shot in the head. Abstract it
out a bit -- it applies to comparisons between governments as well.
Non-sequiter. You confuse net with gross. *An anarchist believes the most capable, focused government *is* herself.
**Yes, I support Declan's right to make up his own mind on such matters,
1) I believe he may be wrong.
2) I'm not the apologist for authoritarianism.

It's true that in the absence of public libraries this would not be an
issue; however, it is an example of the state acting as sovereign, not
employer. We're concerned with the right of patrons to access material, &
they are not state employees. The situation is analogous to a public park:
just because the state owns it, does that mean it can forbid, say, criticism
of the state in it? No, of course not, though it has broader discretion in
limiting the speech of public employees in the park, while on-duty.
