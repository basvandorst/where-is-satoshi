@_subject: Video as a source of randomness 
A thought just occurred to me...
How useful would it be to use a video stream as a source of random input
to something like /dev/random?  I'm thinking along the lines of a
Connectix QuickCam (sp?) or the cool videocam that comes with the Indy.
It seems to me that the picture recieved by a camera sitting atop a
monitor would be quite unpredictable. (relatively) High bandwith, too.
Even if the entropy in a video signal is low, the high bandwidth would
seem to make up for it.
Struggling to keep my head above the crypto tide,
