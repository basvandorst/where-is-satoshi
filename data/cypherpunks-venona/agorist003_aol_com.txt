@_subject: Saturday weekly L.A. gatherings 
TAKE 2!:
It's always something. Saturday, December 10, 1994,
and weekly henceforth (on a trial basis, excluding vacations and holidays
unless someone else wants to host it):

The first logical order of business after introductions, is "is
this the time and the place?" The California Coffee House is
close to my home, and it is a compromise between the
extremes of a restaurant and a meeting hall without food. They serve sandwiches and coffee. They are open 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. on
Saturday. The meeting will start if anyone shows up besides
myself and continue until closing time. And you'll even get a
little brochure! Gosh, golly, gee whiz!!
