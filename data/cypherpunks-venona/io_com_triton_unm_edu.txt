Actually, as nice a guy as I'm sure you are, having worked in banking
for many years, I'm more inclined to trust little blue-haired old
ladies for tasks requiring meticulous attention to detail, than folks
who are more like me. This is just another aspect of charging; it allows you to scale/extend the service beyond the point at which it
holds any charm whatsover to a creative/leading edge type individual.
I don't think you'll find much resistance if you let it be known that
you will eventually hire/contract with a professional to do the ID
validations. It will probably *improve* rather than detract from the
popularity of your service.
I wouldn't bother with most of these for a large-scale public service.  and  easily reduce to   is something you don't want to get
involved with, since the whole point is to let people make their own
decision about whom to trust. Instead of signing keys signed by "good
signers", you're better off periodically posting lists of signers who
are known by each other to follow a certain set of standards, and leave
it at that.
Something like this is probably more practical:
1. Driver's license is presented in person to you or qualified staff.
2. Driver's license and two other ID from list are presented in person
   to you or qualified staff
3. Driver's license is presented in person to registered notary public
   and stamped certificate sent to you.
4. Driver's license and two other ID from list are presented in person
   to registered notary public and stamped certificate sent to you.
I would avoid accepting xeroxes altogether; too easy to forge.
