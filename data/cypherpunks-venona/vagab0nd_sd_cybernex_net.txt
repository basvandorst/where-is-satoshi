That sounds like an excellent deal when I plan to purchase it, but I would
like to see if there is a crippleware demo first.  I already have had 2.6.2
configured with a Windows clipboard utility.  I just want to see if the full
Win/integrated clipboard feature is more efficient.  Thanks Joseph!
P.S. I am also erleg but Majordomo won't unsubscribe me because
I don't seem to be on the 'who cypherpunks' list, but my old address is
still mysteriously reeiving the list.  Any hints?  Yes, I wrote
owner-cypherpunks with no reply.  TIA!

@_subject: Length of passphrase beneficial? 
Feel free to skip to 'Actual Question:' below.
I am one to succumb to the assumed benefits of overkill.  I like
the fact that everyone's use of crypto can cause each
individual transmission to become less suspicious to prying
eyes.  I would love knowing that the govt. spent billions of CPU
cycles on one of my transmissions only to find my softball
schedule.  We could lure them by making our subject lines
'Fertilizer-Bomb Recipe' or 'CHILDPORN.GIF Attached', not
condoning either, of course.
I have a 2048-bit PgP key and pseudorandom a/n character
generator, from which I chose a large passphrase similar to:
(Yes, cut-n-paste, but my only in-house threat is my wife.)
Actual Question:
Does the length and randomness of a passphrase contribute at all
to the overall security of a cryptosystem?
Thanks in advance!

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Without professional knowledge of firewalls, a simple and true
answer is obvious.  Of course they are penetrable; that's what
they are for.  They permit users to penetrate, while attempting
to keep out intruders.  If it were impossible to penetrate
firewalls, then they would pretty much be useless to those with
authorized access.  How could they get in themselves?
Maybe 'feasibility' is the question.  That answer would depend
on some variables on the intruder's end.  If permissions and
rights are allocated to regular users with authorization, then
an intruder with adequate resources, knowledge, time, etc.
should be able to get in.

Good point.  Another bad thing about keeping the passphrase on-line is
that I would have to trasport the passphrase on floppy if I required
portability.  Depending on how important my information may be, I
could possible be carrying my whole life on a floppy.  I see now that
it is better to just memorize a phrase.

@_subject: Re: Twenty Bank Robbers -- Game theory:) 
Here's my guess:
Eache robber is going to want the largest share of the money possible.
Therefore The first guy dies automatically because that increases the share
size.  This continues on until there are only two robbers left.  Robber suggests that he receives the full 20 million and since his vote is 50%, he
receives it all.  18 robbers dead.

OK, robber  secretly discusses with each other robber that if he votes for
 that they will split it.  All robbers thinking this, vote for   then leaves town with 20 million.

Well, two wrong so far, here it is:
Nobody knew that robber was Steven Segal under-cover.   proposed an
even split, so Segal broke his neck.  The other 18, being CypherPunks, were
smart enough to make tracks.  One dead, Segal 20 million, and no lines

I wasn't very clear why  died.  Any suggestion of his is shot down and
then he is killed.  And so on... and so on... until the final two are left.

@_subject: Public vs. Private Munitions 
Here's how I understand it:
     The U.S. Government, concerned only with making America a safer place
for us taxpayers to live in, wants to regulate domestic encryption in order
to have access to the content of all transmissions.  Their theory is that
any cryptosystem that is stronger than their cryptanalysis systems can be
used in illegal transmissions and should be considered munitions.
     Theoretically, the government should only be have the resources to
control commercially-available, public encryption systems.  Who is to stop
anyone from designing their own cryptosystem for personal use?  If the
government intercepted a transmission from this private cryptosystem, and
could not decrypt it, would they assume that it must be considered
munitions?  Similarly, anyone could send uniformly-formatted random garble
that could also be considered munitions, or at least waste the governments
processing time.
     Why are we so worried about government regulation?  Can't we just
devise our own cryptosystems and just don't sell them or make them publicly

I didn't mean that I think that the govt should be allowed to control.  I
meant that govt would only be able to regulate commercial and/or public
systems.  They, of course, would have no say in the specs of my
personally-written cryptosystem.
Sorry about the confusion.  Although I may have used the two terms loosely,
I was trying to contrast commercial and public against something written in
secret and not offered for govt approval.
Absolutely not!  Let me clarify that I feel that the govt should have no
part in crypto regulation, be it commercial, public, private, business, etc.
After some responses and some thought, I have seen the error in my thinking.
Having a secret, proprietary cryptosystem would loose the public-key benefit.
It would be fine, I believe, for point-to-point communications though.

Maybe I read it too fast.  Not only did it have nothing to do with crypto,
but I could not ascertain as to it's relevance to anything whatsoever.
