@_subject: PGP backdoor?  (No, I'm not paranoid.) 
I was recently speaking with a newly-made aquaintence, and we were discussing the merits of various encryption systems.  Now, I had heard
about all the people who claimed the reason versions later than 2.3 wouldn't work with 2.3 was because of a backdoor for the government.  I personally thought they were being paranoid.  However, this guy tells me that he met Phil at defcon and phil told him that he co-operated with the government and gave them information that would enable them to crack key's for versions later than 2.3.   I don't know whether to believe him or not, as I said earlier he is not a long-time friend or anything, so he could just be lying to me.  If anyone has any information on this I would appreciate it.
