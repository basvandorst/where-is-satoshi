Ergotamine relieves migraines by restricting the flow of blood to the
brain. The effects of ingesting large quantities of this substance are
left as an experiment to those for whom a mind isn't such a terrible thing
to waste.

The assumption that this is an "exclusive or" is incredibly naive.

Let me get this straight: a couple of federal (were they in this
case?) LEA's come to your door and say, "Come with us, you and your family
are going to prison because of the color of your skin." You say, "I am a
citizen of of the United States, and my rights are enumerated in the
Constitution. You do not have the authority to incarcerate me without due
process of law. Now please get off my property." The LEA's reply, "Hey,
we're just doing our jobs. Don't give us a hard time, you stupid Nip." You
pick up the shotgun you keep in the closet by the front door and say, "If
I have commited a crime, then arrest me. Otherwise, get off of my
property." The LEA's reply, "You just made a big mistake, bud." Twenty
minutes later they return with a fifty agents with automatic rifles and
orders to shoot to kill the "spy".
Of course, if he just "went along quietly", he would have spent a few
years rotting in an "internment camp" while his business failed or he lost
his job to someone fortunate enough to have immigrated from Italy or
Germany instead of Japan. That's better than endangering the lives or
yourself and your family, right?
You might feel that the example that you responded to was a bit too
simplistically polemic, but I think for many people, especially those in
this forum, your hypothetical situation is not at all an ethical dilemma. -stonedog

Interesting. In NJ, where I have had the misfortune of living, "being able
to face your accuser" means that if the cop doesn't show you have to
reschedule and keep rescheduling until he _does_ show. For this reason, I
had assumed that the "no cop, no case" clause was simply hopeful urban
I tend to be cynical, here in NJ, where I have to pass through a police
roadblock every day on my way to work, and a different one every evening.
Literally. Every day. In less than a mile of State Route 73, if that ever
helps anyone.
If nothing else, we live in a "traffic police state".

I can't read this paragraph without shaking my head in awe. Even if their
motives were for the best, which is certainly debateable, who here _can't_
think of a few incidents where our own government's agencies were involved
in _exactly_ these sorts of activities?  I realize that I'm not saying
anything that hasn't been noted time and again in this forum, but I
suppose I'm young enough that this sort of blatant doublespeak just blows
my mind.

"3. A ban will eventually be lifted, because of the impracticality of
drug enforcement, LEA corruption, the creation of black market drugs of
questionable quality, gangs raiding evidence room stockpiles,
ineffectiveness, sympathetic jurors, etc. The sooner it goes into effect,
the sooner it goes away."
Once a massive enforcement agency is founded, as we've seen time and again
this century, it rarely gets smaller and more limited in scope, and _very_
rarely ever goes away altogether. And rest assured that, like the IRS,
EPA, and the Park Service, this new agency will have its own Special
Weapons teams, snipers, APV's...everything a self-respecting TLA needs.
