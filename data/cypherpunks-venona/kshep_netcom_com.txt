Dear Jason,
I don't think you are neccissarily correct about making an archive of the usenet. You may be correct, but I don't believe this point has been litigated yet. Furthermore, just because something is forwarded and something is archived I don't believe is expressly covered in copyright law. Others could argue that postings by their very nature, when posted become "public domain", and thus not copyrightable. I practice law, but am not a copyright/trademark specialist. Also, as was posted earlier someone is already making an archive of the usenet. See earlier postings. Finally what is the tangible difference between storing usenet postings on a hard disk for an indefinite time, or on a cd-rom, or a cd that is re-writable, or tape or any other storage device? Not very much I would Kirk Sheppard

Usenet copyrightable? I still doubt it. Of course, the only way to find out is to file a very expensive lawsuit. Most posters would not find their postings worth the expense to sue on copyright. Only a very rich dilletante, or someone less rich who is a fanatic on the subject is likely to do so.  Also, you would have a hard time answering the difference between charging for a usenet feed and charging for a cd-rom, again I see little difference except that one is more prompt in time than the other. But, again, my newsfeed from a BBS which might be 24 hrs delayed, and my netcom account which is much faster and a cd-rom differs only as to time removed from the original posting. Kirk Sheppard

Regarding the archive I believe it was some company in Canada, I'm not sure. There was a thread about this archiving question on another group I suppose in the last three weeks. I can't remember where I saw it, if it wasn't here. Sorry. And about "paying" for the cd-rom, I pay for the usenet feed, and none of us who post are getting royalty payments from any of the internet providers. So answer the question again, what is the difference in paying an internet provider for access to usenet, and paying a cd-rom provider for access to usenet? None materially, except that the cd is not interactive, and some providers are (not all as in bbs' that don't send e-mail to the internet, but have some usenet groups.) There is no material difference that I can determine.

This book analogy is not accurate. It is my contention that usenet postings are not copyrighted. Our postings are not disseminated like a book, we are paid nothing for the use of our postings on the multitude of machines that our postings appear. Or, in the alternative, if copyrighted, by posting them in the electronic ether, we give up most of our rights regarding dissemination, copying etc. Perhaps we may still have some residual rights regarding accuracy and the like. Also the posting regarding the legal blurbs on software, really was off point, since what they they were refering to was a "license", and again there is some doubt about how enforceable the individual licenses that the software companies give. That is, some of these licenses may have provisions that are not enforceable.

Dear Mr. Knight,
I am not interested in "tearing apart" anything, I was just participating in a discussion. Ad hominem attacks are really unjustified. Even though you have a hard time understanding my arguments, I have refrained from calling you stupid, until now. You are not only stupid, but silly. "I'm glad your're not a politician" is a non-sequitur, and is certainly irrelevant to the discussion. Further, this whole discussion is entirely "academic", since there is absolutely no case law on this particular subject. So if you are so excited about it, collect your pennies and hire an attorney to enforce your copyright, I'm sure my brethern could use the Kirk Sheppard

This is not an accurate comparison. A posting on usenet is not the same item as a program on HBO or the radio. In what way does my internet provider (netcom) have a "legal" distribution of usenet news, while a cd-rom provider does not? HBO has paid for the use of the programs it broadcasts that are produced by others, hence they have a contract between themselves and the owners of the copyright. No providers of usenet news have any agreements between themselves and the posters regarding copyrights. Netcom and all the other internet providers receive postings "free" and a cd-rom manufacturer has the same "right" to use postings as any other internet provider.

Dear Master Lefty,
You too, have fallen into the same trap, as Master Knight, i.e.,  ad hominem attacks, unprovoked, launched merely because I disagree with you. As to your arguments, no I don't think you have followed my logic at all, and I certainly cannot follow or agree with your assertions. My point is that the redistribution of usenet postings by  Netcom, my local bbs, me on my hard disk to others for pay or not, or by cd-rom are not different and it is just as legal for Netcom to charge me for providing me a usenet feed as it is legal for a cd-rom manufacturer to do the same, neither is paying us a dime nor are they obligated to do so. Personal use is not at all relevant. Netcom, Delphi are copying and providing usenet newsfeeds as a commercial service, without paying any royalties to the authors of the usenet postings. And we can all do the same and use any medium we want to  whether you or Master Knight like it or understand it.

Dear Master Knight,
Normally, I would be happy to oblige in using one's requested term of address, however I may make an exception in this case as you want fair play to be one sided. According to Master Knight, it is OK to start with ad hominem attacks, but not to answer them. Also, Master Knight has this devious habit of posting "private mail" on this list. Twice, now I have answered Master Knight's personal insults with a "private" reply so as to ease the burden on the other members of this  very active list, and twice Master Knight, shamelessly  posts follow-ups to the list. Not very honorable, Master Knight. So no, if I ever have the need to address you again it will be "Master" for you.

My sympathies to you. Others, too, on this list have no respect for privacy, as they post private e-mail to the list with out permission, but make threats in private unposted e-mail. This especially applies to those who violate privacy and make threats under pseudonyms at places and servers that don't support finger or netfind. It is ironic, but sadly this is what the "notorious" Detweiler was teaching us. Kirk Sheppard

@_subject: Re: Tracking Contacts with Clipper 
You don't "charge". You buy a pre-paid card for a set amount of money or minutes. For example Safeway was selling "certificates" good for 30 minutes of long distance for $5. Then you dialed the providers number, entered your certificate number, then dialed in the number you wanted to reach. Much like using MCI 14 years ago. Using a phone booth, would add security. I don't know what type of logs would be kept by the provider. Obviously if they kept a log with caller id info plus the number dialed then they wouldn't be very secure, espicially since the fact that you dialed the provider would be recorded. If a pen register was used on your line, all the info. dialed in would be recorded, including the final destination number. This would of course be true of a wiretap also. Pen registers are more common than full scale wiretaps. Use a pay phone, in concert with the pre-paid cards for maximum security. But of course, the security of the line on the other end is not guaranteed either. Thus, the need for non-clipper voice encrption asap.
