o Escrow agents will certainly be subject to attacks, especially
  by other foreign powers with national-level budgets (for example,
  Britain, France, Israel, Japan, Russia, etc., or multi-nationals),
  *and/or* by talented crackers, or cracker-consortia, such as might
  found be on the cypher-punks mailing list :) :) .  At best, publishing
  the results of successful attacks (say, on alt.whistleblowers) might
  have the positive benefit of eventually dooming the system as a bad idea
  from the start, at the expense of those who chose to use the system
  (evolution in action, I guess), and the taxpayers (who pay for
  implentation & deployment).  That's doing it the hard way, though.
o Social/political-change organizations using the Clipper system for
  their internal communications would be especially vulnerable to
  COINTELPRO-style attacks.
o Typically, "legal authorizations" operate over a constrained period
  of time.  Once that time period is over, the authorization is supposed
  to go away.  However, there's no provision for the released key components
  to go away.  In effect, once key components are released, the corresponding
  user hardware is *permanently* compromised.  It's pretty likely that
  released key components would find their way to such private cop-agencies
  as Wackenhut, or LEIU (Law Enforcement Intelligence Unit), which has
  branches right in the police departments of most major cities.  [typically,
  when "red squads" are ordered to "destroy" their accumulated files,
  the files generally get transferred to LEIU].
o What guarantees the "duopoly" of the 2 escrow agencies?
  It's almost certain that somebody will attempt to "mirror" them,
  whether "legitimately" (CIA, say) or illegitimately, overtly or covertly.
  Again, look for LEIU here.
Maybe they can get the UN in on the deal:
UNESCROW-A and UNESCROW-B!  hee, hee
