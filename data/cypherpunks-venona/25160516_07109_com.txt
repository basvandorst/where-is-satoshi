"Do you own a personal computer?"
      Yes.
       "Running Windows ver 3.xx or 95?"
      Sure:.
  Why?
       "Wanna' make $10,000 cash in the next 60 to 90 days?"
      Who wouldn't?
       "Without leaving home?"  }
      Really?
  What's it about?
       "I own a software program that explains the business?  Do you want to download a FREE evaluation copy?"
      Are you going to tell me what it's about?        "That's not the way I work.  The answers are in the software.  Do you want to download it?"
      Looks like I've got nothing to lose.
  OK!
  Where is it ?
       "Just click here:  ---->  or if by chance you are unable to download it,
