This hearing has been "indefinitely postponed" due tothe realization of
some bright young thing that in this country, at least, private
corporations do not sponsor government hearings. perhaps this is a way to
raise some much needed reveneu, but for now it's a no-go.

"Overpopulation has led to ever-increasing governmental control over the
private citizen, not on the old-style police-state models of oppression
and terror, but in terms of work, credit, housing, retirement benefits,
and medical care: things which can be withheld. These services are
computerized. No number, no service. However, this has not produced the
brainwashed standardized human units postulated by such linear prophets as
George Orwell. Instead, a large percentage of the population has been
forced underground. How large, no one knows. These people are NUMBERLESS."
From _Blade Runner (a movie)_, William S. Burroughs, 1979, Blue Wind Press

About a year ago my wife got a phone call from a stranger claiming to believe
he had gone to high school with her, but he wasn't really sure.  After
a whole song and dance he finally said, nonchalantly, "Well, gee, what was your mother's maiden name?"
Since her mother's maiden name was not, "Fuck you, asshole", I gathered from those words that she had figured out his scam. Who knows who he was. We immediatley changed all maiden-name passwords to
something more obscure and less socially-engineerable.
