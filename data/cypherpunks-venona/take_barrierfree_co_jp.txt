o MITI (Japanese Government's Ministry of International
Trade and Industry) began to develop electronic notary
system with some biggest computer company in Japan;
Hitachi, Nihon I.B.M., NEC and Fujitsu.  Some Japanese
bigger bank (such as Daiichi-Kangyo Bank) will also take
part in it.
o It seems to me (by reading this article) that MITI want
to develop Japan-original technology for the electronic
notary system.
o Milestone of the plan:
 - Misc. preparations for it until the end of 1996.
 - Doing experimental examination in 1997.
# I don't know that 1996/1997 are fiscal year (called
# "(kaikei-)nendo" in Japan) or not.  Japanese fiscal year
# starts April in every year.
o This system will be applied for following term:
 1) submitting of public docments to public offices,
 2) electronic commerce,
 3) electronic publishing,
 4) electronic warehouse service.
o IC card will be used in order to store digital key

I found key escrow article on the Asahi Shinbun.  Asahi
Shinbun is one of the most famous Japanese newspaper.  I
can't write more info because I am busy now.

 >>I heard that CitiBank has filed for a patent in Japan with 140+ claims
The document is on my desk:
  CitiBank's patent in Japan  Toku-Kou-Hei 7-111723
    o 104 claims
    o published date: 29 Nov, 1995
    o 112 pages (text: 48 pages, fig.: 64 pages.)
# Note:
# "Toku" means "Tokkyo", "tokkyo" == "patent"

# "Hei" means "Heisei", "Heisei" is the Japanese year-

A publication of the CitiBank's patent was a big news in
industrial or financial domain in Japan.  I found the
article on Nikkei-Sangyo shinbun.

Probably yes.

I think that Japanese P.O. has changed their policy in a
few years influenced with U.S.P.O.

Dear Mr. Robert Hettinga,
This is Tsuyoshi Hayashi, one of subscribers of the
cypherpunks list, lives in Yokohama, Japan.
I heard today's your voice on the cypherpunks list.  I am
little sad.
I am almost ROM, read-only member...  Although I have been

(or four...) messages.  I am a bad boy.
Sorry. > all
Instead of it, I have gotten many many cripto-concerned
info (such as PGP) which are worth reading (though they
are very difficult for me, both technical and language ;-).
Today I know about cryptography a little.  I am working
nearby the cryptographic field in Japan.  So I DO want to
say THANKS to all subscribers of the list and the
owner-cypherpunks and the host machine named
toad.com [140.174.2.1].

In my far memory, it was about 50-70 pages.  It seems to
be a digest or a boneless version.
Each OECD member country ought to localize the Wassenaar
Arrangement and make effect it in each country.  So, I
think you can get the localized version of it from http:

Please add mixer the first public remailer in
Japan, was setup by a member of cypherpunks-j.
# it is not me.

mixer is probably:
  $remailer{"mixer"} = " cpunk mix pgp";
Please add this record to your check list.
Note that a lot of members at cypherpunks-j are now
leaning how to use remailer(s) and they (and I) want to
need some info about it.  So, in the next time, please
send your report (everytime) to cypherpunks-j's list,
