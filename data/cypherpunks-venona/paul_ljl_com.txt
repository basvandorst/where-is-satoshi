There are still a few unclear (to me) points about this story:
1. CWD says that RSA's Japanese subsidiary developed the chips. Markoff
says NTT did. It sounds to me like NTT is the more likely developer, since
they have a great deal of silicon design experience.
2. Markoff's story says that NTT doesn't have licenses to use RSA
technology (the quote from Junichi Kishigami), but the bit about safely
swapping private-key info makes me wonder if instead they're using DH-- the
patent for which expires next year. A telecom chipset could make productive
use of DH for key exchange at call setup.
3. Once you import an ITAR item, its export becomes controlled. Importing
the NTT chipset for use, say, in a Motorola cell switch (made in IL) would
seem to be problematic. Buying chips in Japan for shipment to Moto's phone
factories in Singapore and Malaysia, however, would appear to be OK. Under
the present export regs, it's not clear to me how many US manufacturers
would adopt this chipset since it doesn't give them any export relief. If
the NRC's recommendations are adopted, that still won't help, since
triple-DES is over their recommended limit.
The _good_ news is that US manufacturers could put these chipsets into
domestic-only products, and I sincerely hope they will.

@_subject: Verisign CA practices documents 
Verisign's put their Certification Practice Statement up at
. This document appears to set
forth the policies Verisign's implementing when it acts as a CA.
I haven't fully reviewed it yet, but my hat's off to Verisign for coming
clean and clearly stating their policies.

BY SAFEMAIL-----
When you buy Que's current Netscape book (_Special Edition, Using Netscape
3_), the included CD has the US-only, 128-bit, non-export version of
Navigator on it. It's a licensed copy, even! (Of course, the book also has
a small yellow "NOT FOR EXPORT" tag on the back cover, but who's counting?)
For $49, getting a licensed copy of the 128-bit Navigator 3.0 plus a 1000+
page book is a pretty good deal. My hat's off to Netscape for choosing to
put the 128-bit version on the CD, and to Macmillan/Que for bothering to
get the software in the first place. I really do believe that Netscape
wants to get secure software out as widely as possible.
(Disclaimer: I wrote chapter 29 (the intro to JavaScript chapter) for
_Special Edition, Using Netscape 2_. Que reused it, but I don't get paid
any extra. It's a comprehensive book, and the CD has lots of cool stuff on
it too.)

Ahem. That would be us. We run the Fortezza web site under contract to

other products that can use Fortezza or Entrust; we also have some other
products in development using more cypherpunkish cryptosystems.
