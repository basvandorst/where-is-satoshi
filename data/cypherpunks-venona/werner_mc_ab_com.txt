I must say that I attempted to subscribe in december and didn't start

explained to the list that he had been away for some time.
By that time I had subscribed from another address, and suddenly found
myself reading the list from two accounts. It had been so long since I
subscribed that I had forgotten the cypherpunks-request bit, and just
remembered that it was some 'toad' thing. When I saw someone had sent a
cancel request to cypherpunks I assumed that was correct.
My own attempt to unsubscribe from the extra account resulted immediately
in 3 mail messages, two of which were somewhat abusive. One person seemed
to be under the impression that this is a usenet group, and therefore I
shouldn't send unsubscribe messages to it, since only mailing lists
are for subscribing/unsubscribing.
The next day, Eric sent me mail with the right address for unsubscribe

I believe Eric's point was a little off, anyway.  The bank at Monte Carlo
was broken using exactly the method which he was attempting to discredit.
A man went to the casino with several suitcases full of money and proceeded
to play roulette using the progressive betting strategy.  Eventually he
broke the bank.  That's when casinos started imposing house limits on the
tables.  I don't think this story is apocryphal.
With no house limit, I think it is far more likely that someone with *lots*
of money will break the bank than it is that, say, 'red' will come up 30
times in a row.
I don't think the commodity exchanges have the same sort of limits set up.

I took a probability class in the early '70s.  The prof explained the
progressive betting system and told us the Monte Carlo story.  As I recall,
it took place in the late 1700s.  That's all I can remember, except that he
made it clear the system was not guaranteed to work even with no house
limit unless you have unlimited funds.  Just that someone actually did
break the bank at Monte Carlo.
I have used the system twice and won both times.  The second time I almost
got burned when red came up 6 times in a row.  On the 7th time I had $320
riding on black and it came up black.  My profit on the 7 spins: $5.  I was
only 1 spin away from the house limit.  If it had come up red, I could have
bet $640 on black one more time, but that would have been the end.  The
limit was $1250.  I almost switched the $320 to red.
After that experience I decided to do some analysis of the system, and
finally managed to convince myself of something that I should have known
all along: the house limits are set so that you will lose the same amount
of money in the long run if you bet progressively as you will if you just
bet $5 on black each time.
Next time I get to a library I will see if I can find out anything else
about it, if you are really interested.
That's not entirely true.  I do know that the commodities market is another
place where you can lose a lot of money real quick. :)
Actually, when I said 'the same sort of limits', what I meant was limits
that are specifically designed to ensure that you will lose eventually,
like they have at casinos.  For instance, the house limit at a casino is
generally such that you can only double your bet 7 times (e.g., $1250 limit
on a $5 table, or $500 limit at a $2 table).
Is the same sort of low limit placed on commodities trades?

Not necessarily.  One could get in the habit of keeping all one's files
encrypted, decoding only the material that one has to occasionally release
in order to convince one's boss that one is doing productive work on one's
computer.  :-)
Many times when one is fired, one does not have the option of logging in
one last time.  The boss taps you on the shoulder, and escorts you to
human resources.  While you are having your exit interview, the sysadmin
is disabling your account.
For instance, the emacs editor has a mode (see crypt++.el) that
automagically prompts for a decryption key wheneve you open a file that
appears not to be pure text, in case you want to pass it through crypt
before editing it.  Only in the editor's buffer does it ever appear in
decoded form.  On the disk it is always encrypted.
If one got fired unduly, one's former bosses would have to ask for the key.
Of course, the usual reason peopnle get fired is incompetence, so there
may not be anything worthwhile laying around anyway.

As I recall, you have to receive a letter from them with your password, so
they know at least your address (no PO box, I think, not sure, been too

cool, but they have a couple of rules about abusing the account.  They do
carry all the Usenet groups.
Also, there are times when it is impossible to log in.  Many times, when
you do get in, the response time is unacceptable.

I agree.  I believe that discussions of privacy issues belong on this
list as well.  If I have to subscribe to a separate list to keep up
with means of privacy-protection so be it, but I'd rather not have to.

Speaking of Schneier, I have an upbeat note.
I ordered his book, when it first came out, from the local Borders book
store.  When I went to pick it up, they told me that if I decided to buy it
I could not return it, since it was not a book that they would otherwise
Today I was there checking out the computer books, and they had a copy on
the shelf, so I guess it was in enough demand that they decided to stock it.

This is a neat way of expressing a good idea, but I wouldn't count on it.
A language can probably be construed as something that can be understood by
anyone who learns it.  Even though I speak PGP, I still can't understand
what you say without a key.  There's probably no legal precedent for that
yet, but look what they've done with the rest of the Constitution so far.
Depending on technicalities to get the authoritarians to leave us alone
will not work.  We elect these people to serve us, but they think they are
our keepers.  If we actually had freedom of religion in the U.S. there
would be no laws against the use of sacramental drugs, for instance.
Sorry I don't have a better argument than yours for the legitimacy of
government-proof encryption, but I think we need one.

@_subject: Re: Det./tmp/Nym on Netcom 
I noticed that both tmp and nym mentioned in one of their early posts that
they had read up about cypherpunks in the archives at soda, or some such,
and that it was ok to launch right into the discussion, since he/she was up
to date with the issues.  This was followed, of course, by the usual long
and boring happy horseshit.
I also noticed a common net phenomenon: since Sue D. Nym appeared from
his/her name to be female, some men were more likely to come to his/her
defense when he/she was flamed.  This reminded me of the blurb I read in
Wired (bad magazine, I've since stopped subjecting my eyes to the green
print on red background) about men using names like "Janet" trying to
sweet-talk lesbians on IRC and eventually finding out that "Karen" was also
a man.

Project GNU of the Free Software Foundation is conducting a survey to
determine the kinds of mathematical software commonly utilized by scientists
and mathematicians.  Your answers will help us to determine the programming
tasks we present to our volunteers.  This will ultimately result in a more
complete set of math programs and subroutines available as free software. Please answer the following questions with regard to scientific,
mathematical, and/or statistical software:
   1.  What packages are commonly used?
   2.  What programs and subroutines are desired, but not available?
   3.  What freeware currently exists?
   4.  Where else can we ask these questions?
Please give as much detail as you can, including package name, author,

@_subject: filtering this list 
Well, I've had procmail running for some time now, and it helps a
lot, but I still need to do some kind of post-procmail processing.
So I'm asking anyone who feels helpful today to give me a short
howto or some pointers.  I don't use gnus, but I tried starting it
up with my crypto folder as input, and it didn't work.  I'm not
sure yet where I made my mistake.
Before I spend a couple of hours re-inventing the wheel, can someone
tell me the preferred method for reading a mail folder that allows
one to do things like marking a subject as read?  Right now, I'm
using rmail (in emacs) to read my crypto folder, and it's just not
that easy to kill off a thread once I've had my fill.
For instance, I enjoyed the nuclear thread for awhile, but I would
have liked to be able to just 'k' it at one point.
thanks in advance,

I built crypt awhile back.  I'm pretty sure I got the source from
ghost.dsi.unimi.it.  Now that site says everything has been moved to
ftp.dsi.unimi.it, but there seems to be no crypt.c there, although there
is plenty of other crypt stuff.  In the meantime, I was cleaning up (big
mistake), and lost my copy of the source.
Can someone tell me where the source is for the crypt program?  I'd like
to build it for my Linux system.
ps I promise not to export it.

[I accidentally sent this to owner-cypherpunks before.  Sorry if it
shows up again later. tw]
I was thinking that Robert meant something like getting a usenet feed
via mail.
Speaking of which, are there any sort of "public", or "free" NNTP
servers?  Or even "cheep"?  Even just read-only?  I'm afraid of losing
my full feed along with my account when I finish my masters.  I don't
want to go for a PhD just so I can keep browsing the alt groups.

@_subject: Re: usenet-to-mail 
Well, like I said, it's the alt groups that I'm worried about.  I have
an excellent net connection at work, being employed by a subsidiary of
Rockwell, but our news feed is politically correct.  I have access to
two accounts with full feeds, but one is not a shell account, and the
other one is the school account which goes away in a another year
(depending on how long I can drag out the degree), unless I start taking
post-grad classes.
So, my hope is that I can use gnus to talk to some other newsserver than
the censored local one.  I will try some of the places that were posted.
As far as the private newsserver provider goes, I'd go for it (when the
time comes), if I could buy just access to Usenet for a discount.  For
that matter, maybe a couple of years from now the Republicans will have
figured out a way to shut down the alt groups.  ;-)
I'm better off if I keep taking classes, anyway.  Don't know about the
rest of the folks on this list, but I don't feel like what I know about
computers today will carry me through retirement.

@_subject: [cpunks] Re: public accounts / PGP / passphrases 
Well, for one thing you don't need a phone line in your scenario.  You
can probably just connect the serial port of your laptop to one of the
decstation serial ports, using a null-modem cable (pins 2 and 3 swapped;
4 jumpered to 5; 6, 8, and 20 jumpered to each other; and 7 passed
through, or something like that)
But I agree that the idea of buying a laptop so you can use PGP at work
is odious.  There must be a better way.

@_subject: Is it legal for commercial companies to use PGP? 
I was reading in some Where to Get PGP Web page that "PGP2.6.2 is legal
to use in the U.S. for non-commercial purposes (i.e., you cannot sell it
or the functionality it provides)".  Can anyone on the list say whether
this is true?  That is, was the use of "i.e." correct, or should it have
been "e.g."?
Or, to put it more succinctly, I was talking to one of the sys admins at
A-B, and he said that we weren't allowed to use PGP to encrypt our mail,
because Viacrypt owned the commercial rights.  But, according to the bit
I quoted, it would only be a violation if A-B tried to put PGP into one
of their products.
Has anyone heard a (hopefully legal, but I'll listen to anyone's
opinion) answer to this?

@_subject: Re: Is it legal for commercial companies to use PGP? 
I should have mentioned that I have no problem with people trying to
make money.  However, it turns out that ViaCrypt is not selling
site-licenses, or even floating licenses, so they actually want to sell
a separate copy for every user that will use it.
As it happens, the aforementioned sys admin had purchased 5 licenses, to
take care of the 2 users he already knew about, and figuring that there
would probably be a couple more wanting to jump on the bandwagon.  He
offered to let me use one of the licenses, but there's no way I can go
and tell my users "we have PGP", if I can't tell everyone that they can
do it.
And, there's no way I can see convincing my boss that we need that many
copies of ViaCrypt, just so everyone in my department can encrypt their
email traffic.
Of course, I realize that none of the above changes the legality.

@_subject: Re: Is it legal for commercial companies to use PGP? 
Maybe "commercial company" is the wrong expression.  All I meant was
that my company is not non-profit, or a university, or a government
organization.  It is an engineering firm.  What I have in mind is
nothing to do with a commercial use of encryption per se. If they decided to put encryption into a product, that would be
something else entirely.  I doubt they would ever be using it to accept
payment for the stuff they sell, although I don't really know much about
the marketing aspect of the business.
Basically, I have two potential uses for it:
1) I have some email pen-pals that I would like to be able to use PGP to
   talk with.  All my other accounts (freenet, school) have mail
   forwarded to what I think of as my email "home address", which is my
   work address.  I would like to use that work account to process my
   email.  Is it legal to use PGP 2.6.2 for this purpose?  I'd also like
   to be able to tell fellow workers that they can use it, and show them
   how. 2) It's entirely likely that people within the company may wish to get
   into the habit of transmitting company data in encrypted form.  This
   is not a question of incorporating the encryption technology into a
   product, or even into the sale of a product -- it's just a question
   of keeping intra-company information transfers private.
The first is the one I'm really concerned with.  The second would be
sort of a natural extension that, if legal, would be nice.  I can't
imagine that these uses are subject to the ViaCrypt license, but I need
some reassurance/ammunition in order to be a little more open about
getting it installed on the machines in my department.
