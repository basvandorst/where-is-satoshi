@_subject: screensavers and idle computation. 
To the folx working on the RC4 et. al. distributed keysearch Net:
Add a module that will be run from things like "xscreensaver".  As Tim May
pointed out, current use of crypto is a "tiny fraction of
the total computons consumed running screen savers".  So let use them, eh?
Besides, it'd be kind of neat seeing the "galaxies in hyperspace" displayed
in a fractal like screensaver image.
