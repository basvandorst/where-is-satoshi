@_subject: yet another remailer 
I've set up another remailer, this one on my ocf account.  It's also based
on Hal's (very easy to use and useful) script and does not yet have
encryption because pgp201 is not the most portable thing around.
To use, just do the standard thing:

and it will do the rest.  Have fun!
