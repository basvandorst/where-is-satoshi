Ok, call me a skeptic.
I made to tries at generating a 2048-bit key on my 33-MHZ 386 machine
using PGP 2.6.2.
Yes, I know I only get 2047 bits, but that's not what bothers me. What bothers me is the first key generation only took thirty seconds,
and the second one under ten minutes.
Two questions:
1) Why such disparity in the two times?
2) Can the key generation possibly be done on my machine that
quickly?  I was expecting it to take at least several hours, based on
what I've been reading in the cryptology groups.

The aforementioned signed message from PKZ's lawyer message failed
signature check on my system, apparently because it contained a very
long text line which, somewhere along the way, was chopped into two
lines before it arrived in my mailbox.  The two lines as they appeared in my message (which failed signature
test) are:

The goal is to convince the two groups of concerned parties that the
remailer operators don't know the contents of what's passing through
their remailers:
         (1) the people who use the remailer, who get a measure of              comfort from knowing their communication is secure
         (2) legal groups etc. who may try to hold the remailer              liable in some way for what passes through their remailer.
A large percentage of material that passes through remailers might
be offensive to SOMEONE---if even just because an unpopular opinion
is expressed.  The remailers are operated by people who want to promote information
flow, not restrict it.  They provide an important service that is of
critical importance to some people and groups who use the net.  They
shouldn't be held accountable for the few who abuse the remailers,
and encryption helps prevent that from happening.

Those who believe remailers are an evil will argue against any
measure that will promote their presence (and I'm not suggesting
you're in that group).  I disagree strongly with their stance.  I would be happy if there
were three of four times as many remailers operating as there are
The issue of whether encryption is a foolproof defense is not the
primary issue.  The issue is: what steps can be taken to improve the
lifespan of existing remailers and promote the addition of new ones.
Resolving the problems that cause remailers to fold will be an
evolutionary process, and no step along that path will be perfect or
resolve all the problems that plague the remailers. Is encryption a step in the right direction, if an imperfect one?  If
not I hope some other positive steps are proposed soon, else I fear
remailers may face extinction.

In article <9501150554.AA29412 Here, I don't understand your point.  If you mean an encrypted
message to a remailer cannot result in a plaintext usenet posting,
that of course is not true.  The remailers have PGP keys of their
own, just as any private user may.  In addition, some of the
remailers support direct usenet posting.  Thus, a message may be
encrypted to the remailer and posted as plaintext as the remailer
decrypts the message.
Agreed.  At least some remailers accept requests from users that they
not receive anonymous mail.  The process of "kill-filing" outbound
anonymous mail targeted for specific locations could of course be

Ah, yes.  Another knight-on-the-net.  Sorry folks, but I hate it when
the "little people" (other people's view)  are insulted.
