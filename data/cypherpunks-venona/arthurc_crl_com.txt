@_subject: Virtual City (tm) Network FAQ 1.0 (fwd) 
Greetings. I hope that I'm not spamming the list with this monster
forwarded FAQ. But since the author(s) are proposing, as one of the stated
goals of Virtual City(tm):       The Virtual City(tm) Network will also be a
      proving ground for privacy technologies such as public key
      cryptography, PGP, and Digital Cash(tm).
I thought that folks here might be interested. Has anyone heard of this
outfit? Is it for real or a huge slice of lemon meringue in the sky?
---------- Forwarded message ----------
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THE VIRTUAL CITY (tm) NETWORK?
The Virtual City(tm) Network is an ambitious Networked Virtual Reality
Infrastructure which will link current Internet information technology
with the emerging capabilities of on-line virtual reality
environments.  Using existing software which implements shared,
interactive virtual spaces we will extend the paradigm of the FreeNet
community into virtual reality by creating online cities and
communities in which people may share text, graphics, and multimedia
in a cooperative real-time environment.  These online communities will
be able to make use of cutting edge tools such as network
conferencing, collaboration & visualization tools, multimedia
electronic mail, online access to government data, networked library
catalogs & facilities, electronic books online and Internet-accessible
public data repositories.  The Virtual City(tm) Network will also be a
proving ground for privacy technologies such as public key
cryptography, PGP, and Digital Cash(tm).
DIDN'T YOU RUN AN AD IN _WIRED_ RECENTLY?
NO.  And again, No.  The Virtual City (tm) Network is the brainchild
of one M. Strata Rose, longtime net.lurker and sometime visionary, who
has been developing the concept since roughly June 1992.  I started
serious feasibility exploration in December of '92 and have been on
track on a timeline which formally started in May '93.  The folks who
put an ad in _WIRED_ are Objective Communications of Illinois.
Virtual City (tm) is a trademark of M. Strata Rose and VirtualNet
(currently undergoing formal incorporation).  We are registered with
the NIC as VIRTUAL.NET and VIRTUAL-CITY.COM.
OH, COME ON-- TRADEMARKING THE PHRASE "VIRTUAL CITY"?
The concept of creating virtual communities in a Mush/MUD/MOO
environment has been kicking around for many years, and quite a bit of
work has been done by a great many people.  However, there is a
particular on-line public access service concept which I call the
Virtual City (tm) Network.  As it says in the terrifying amount of
paperwork required to file a trademark, "this application in no way
attempts to restrict the usage of the terms 'virtual' or 'city',
merely their usage in conjunction where applicable to services in this
class".  Or something highly similar but in stricter legalese, as per
professional advice.
WELL, HOW IS YOUR "VIRTUAL CITY (tm) NETWORK" DIFFERENT FROM THEIR "VIRTUAL CITY"?
Obviously there is a limit to the extent to which I can comment, as
both of our offerings seem to be in a pre-release state.  However, a
brief telephone conversation with an individual at Objective
Communications indicated some important differences:
1) The Virtual City (tm) Network will be free for individuals to
access; charges will only be levied on entities attempting to conduct
profitable business activities.  My understanding is that Objective
plans to charge fees at all levels of participation in their service.
2) The Virtual City (tm) Network has been designed for multimedia and
information service access from the ground up.  My understanding is
that Objective's service is text-only and the gentleman on the phone
indicated that they had no current plans to expand it to multimedia.
3) VirtualNet incorporates both a for-profit corporation and a not-for-profit research arm.  One of our primary goals for the Virtual
City(tm) Network is to take the Cleveland FreeNet model into virtual
space.  The Virtual City (tm) Metropolitan Transit Authority, VCMTA,
is being designed concurrently as an object transport model between
instantiations of various Virtual City (tm) Sites.  We will be
offering templates for instantiations of our city model to be used by
communities and organizations, with a true distributed model allowing
users and information to flow freely throughout the Virtual City (tm)
We are attempting to build an expandable, scalable piece of Internet
infrastructure that will support a rich model of growth and
self-determination as well as support research on virtual communities
and cyberspaces in general.  Look for abstracts, research papers,
RFC's and API's from us in the coming year.
NO KIDDING.  TELL ME MORE.
One of my design goals in building the Virtual City(tm) Network is to
challenge people's assumptions about "the real world" versus "the
virtual world"; many if not most of people's interactions today
take place in a virtual world which has been largely co-opted by the
real world.  Newspapers, television, and radio are all prime
examples-- most of these rely on mental constructions based on
primarily verbal input or on finely crafted presentations which have
little to do with "reality", yet few people consider to what degree
these omnipresent factors constitute much of their information flow.
A wonderful example is the Android Sisters' "Money" (radioplay "Ruby",
ZBS Productions).  The Sisters hold up two items, described as two
pieces of paper, to a "viewer" and ask for her description.  Her
reply, "well, one is a piece of paper, but the other is money" elicits
the ruefully exasperated reply "two pieces of paper!".  The well-made
point is that people's cognitive mappings have become so rigidly
codified that they view their world through highly constrained filters
to the point of shutting out other options.
In the Virtual City(tm) Network, the line between the real and the
virtual has the inherent ability to be deliberately blurred.
Information from "the real world" can be presented as often as
possible in a matter of fact way.  I hope to feature several space
station designs from the cutting edge of the aerospace industry, and
the reported weather in the outdoor sections of the city will come
from weather data live from local feeds, updated to the San Mateo
Bridge area, the putative location of the site.  Our virtual
coffeehouses will tie into Internet game servers of various sorts and
we are investigating links to real-world coffeehouses via terminals
in the field.  Imagine chatting on a virtual terminal via the Internet
to folks on real terminals in coffeehouses.  Now who's real and who's
OKAY, WHAT'S YOUR TECHNOLOGY BASE?
We are currently using LambdaMOO, an object-oriented virtual
environment designed at Xerox PARC.  Instantiations of LambdaMOO are
already being used to provide virtual spaces in which researchers,
educators, and interested folks can meet and interact online, such as
MIT Media Lab's "MediaMOO", "JaysHouseMOO". the original "LambdaMOO"
and a growing plethora of others.  Various university and individual
projects are adding the capability to access certain Internet
information resources such as the "archie" FTP search engine and
University of Minnesota's Internet Gopher browser [JaysHouse MOO].
Xerox PARC is working on a project called "AstroVR" in which
extensions to the text-based MOO software allow astrophysicists to
share graphical images and data.  The PARC team is also working on
MBONE extensions to LambdaMOO; these extensions will allow LambdaMOO
users to use the Multicast Backbone to do real-time audio and video
conferencing using tools which are being developed concurrently by the
greater networking community.  We are working on extensions which will
combine the functionality of NCSA's Mosaic information browser with
the virtual environment capabilities of LambdaMOO.
Mosaic is a hypertext browser through which individuals may access
various Internet services such as World Wide Web, Gopher, WAIS, and
archie.  The World Wide Web in particular uses a format called HTML
(HyperText Markup Language) to create documents which can access other
documents with a single mouse click from the browser.  We are adding
the ability for SGML or HTML documents to be valid MOO objects; this
single extension opens up a significant range of possibilities which
represent needed interconnectivity between the MOO environment and the
wider world of Internet information.  Virtual spaces in the MOO can
then lead directly to an information cache, and information browsers
on the Internet can interact with MOO spaces as well.
This is just the beginning.  In particular, the Virtual City (tm)
Network is being designed to allow encapsulation of other information
formats and explicit handoff to both public and proprietary
information servers.  Our model is very similar to the one which NCSA
developed with Mosaic.  You interact with our virtual spaces using
custom clients or browsers which can invoke various service handlers
or interaction programs on your host machine.  Just as Mosaic will
bring up a GIF viewer when you reference a GIF file, the Virtual City
(tm) browser could invoke Virtus Walkthrough (tm Virtus) or the BRL-CAD
environment on a virtual space.  You might enter a virtual space with
encapsulated or referenced data available in several formats that your
client or browser could handle.
WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
Ah, this is one of the really great parts-- if we can hand you off to
some other viewer or program or even another server, then the Virtual
City (tm) Network is truly expandable and extensible.  We will be able
to offer services that no one has even thought of yet as long as they
run over the Internet infrastructure (ie, TCP/IP or something that can
encapsulate itself in it).  The Virtual City (tm) Network will grow
along with virtual reality and internet information technology, since
new services can be accessed in a plug-and-play fashion.  What we're
trying to do here is essentially spawn a meta-infrastructure context
in which to tie together highly varied services.  This is also where
VCMTA comes in.
WHAT'S VCMTA?
VCMTA, the Virtual City(tm) Metropolitan Transit Authority, will be
developed concurrently.  This facility will provide authentication
services for moving database objects between servers on different
hosts, as well as implementing state-of-the-art privacy enhancements
for secure communication & transactions.  VCMTA will allow us to
network instances of the Virtual City (tm) Template together and allow
people to "move" between them in one ever-growing virtual space.
We realize that there are hard problems to solve in building any sort
of object transport facility; however, our philosophy is that we can't
work miracles but can make something that works, is customizable and
configurable, and will make most people happy.
Obviously you can't "move" objects, however you can build objects
which rely on a core object library, are "registered" with VCMTA, and
follow certain rules as to their behavior on other servers and in
other conditions.  The nature of our distributed architecture already
means that resources you access are not necessarily on the VC server,
this is the logical next step.
WELL THIS IS ALL VERY NICE, BUT I DON'T PROGRAM AT ALL SO I PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO USE IT MUCH.
Current implementations of MOOs and MUDS require that users be able to
program at a fairly sophisticated level in order to enjoy the full
power of MOO/MUD environments, especially in constructing new objects.
We feel that this encourages "second-class citizen" status for those
virtual citizens who cannot or will not learn to program proficiently.
Accordingly, the Virtual City(tm) Network is being designed with
virtual storehouses of objects which can be drawn from and user
friendly front-ends with which to customize those objects to create
personalized and useful virtual spaces.  The full power of the MOO
internal programming language will still be available to those who
care to use it, but those who have neither the time nor desire to do
so will be able to interact as fully as the programming hoi-polloi.
As part of this effort, we are designing interactive front-ends to
interface with the storehouses of objects and handle simple
customization.  Certain "city services" such as phones, chat lines,
radios, gopher slates, etc will be available as well as common objects
(and unusual ones!) from various individuals.  By the way, if you
register an object for public use and it passes the Virtual City (tm)
Architectural Board (no Trojan horses or duds, please!), it no longer
counts against your quota.  Keen, eh?
THIS IS STARTING TO SOUND PRETTY COOL.  ARE YOU SURE IT'S There will be no charge for private individuals to access the Network
and to engage in building and programming activities (up to a generous
initial quota, as in most other MOOs or MUDs).  Non- profit and
government organizations will be allocated space at no charge in the
Virtual City(tm) Marketplace, Business District, and other public
areas.  Cultural attractions such as art galleries, museums, and music
halls are placed throughout the Virtual City(tm) Network; space in
these attractions will be donated to artists and community projects to
publicize their work.  The several museums will feature examples of
the growing number of online exhibits such as the Library of Congress'
current Vatican Project.
Corporations and other for-profit entities may be charged membership
fees on a monthly basis, as well as rent for virtual spaces in which
to transact business.  Our basic paradigm is that if you're in the
Virtual City (tm) Network to generate professional profitable activity
then you should pay a fee to do so.  Ie., the customary net.forsale or
net.jobs type of stuff is just fine, whereas setting up a virtual
office in which to run a real-time on-line consulting business would
require paying rent.  Arrangements can be made on a rental or
percentage basis, or both.
We are very interested in supporting subscription-based services where
subscribers are allowed access to custom objects or facilities.  This
can be a very economical way to do rich text or multimedia electronic
publishing in a small-press model, or provide specialized databases or
services at a modest cost to subscribers.  WHAT SORT OF FACILITIES ARE YOU PLANNING?
In addition to those mentioned above, we will have all the standard
amenities-- Alexandria, the Virtual Library, a business district,
arcade and game areas, residential streets, a campus area where
several interesting projects are being designed, transit facilities,
and so on.  We're choosing to leave MBONE facilities out on this pass
due to bandwidth considerations; however, we plan on supporting such
diverse applications and protocols as Netjam MIDI, CUSeeMe network
video conferencing, various whiteboard tools, IRC with local client
enhancements, connections to other MOOs/MUDS, NCSA & BRL-CAD
visualization environments, group collaboration tools, interactive
game servers, Internet Talk Radio, etc.  We're exploring support for
proprietary and vendor environments as well, such as Autodesk, Virtus,
SGI, and other virtual reality software interfaces.
We also have several original-design projects up our virtual sleeves
such as the Virtual Coffeehouses, the Twilight Lands where
storytellers roam the campfires, the UpAbove and DownBelow space and
marine research station simulators, a Virtual Physics Lab, and so on.
Not to mention the Virtual City (tm) Marketplace, Information Center,
and On-Line Technical Support Center where you can sell your products
or services with minimal overhead and rely on our expertise to deliver
your information to the Internet community.  WOW, I'M CONVINCED.  HOW DO I LOG ON? We're terribly sorry, but you can't log in quite yet.  We will be
opening the database to key implementors once we finish the C
modifications to the LambdaMOO server and to the LambdaCore.  We had
planned a general announcement in mid to late November, but
circumstances required otherwise.  We are taking lists of pre-
registrants, though.  Send email to "vcreg with pertinent
info: your name, your requested character name, and a short blurb
which will become your initial description.  Oh yes, and your Public
Don't have one?  Tsk, tsk, they're a good thing to have in general; go
out and connect to a public key server and get yourself a key-- we'll
send out your initial password encrypted to you, and you can decipher
it with our public key.  Fun, eh?  If you're a sufficiently
enthusiastic cyberspace denizen to pre-reg, you probably already have
a public key...
We are planning a Virtual New Year's Party at the very least, even if
all net services are not on-line yet.  The HTML/SGML capability is
really the critical factor-- we will open as soon as that is reliably
running and add other services as our range of interfaces expands.
Even if our (free) custom browser is not finished by then you will
still be able to use standard MUD/MOO clients in conjunction with
Mosaic or similar HTML browsers to enjoy the multimedia capabilities.
WELL, DO YOU NEED ANY HELP?  HOW DO I GET INVOLVED?
I'm glad you asked that question.  :-) Since a critical aspect of our
project is free public access, we need volunteers!  Our schedule has
been accelerated fairly rapidly at this point and we could use a hand
fairly soon.  Send email to "vcbuild with some brief
notes about what you're interested in implementing and your level of
familiarity with MOO coding.  If you have experience with server and
core-level mods, there may be funding in it as well, though we are
primarily looking for volunteers at this time.
ISN'T THIS GETTING PRETTY LONG FOR A "FAQ" FOR SOMETHING NEW THAT NOT MANY FOLKS OUTSIDE OF THE BAY AREA HAVE EVEN HEARD OF?
Totally correct.  Send questions, suggestions, pointers, flames, and
so on to "vc  If you'd like to be on a mailing list for

@_subject: Re: The Bank of the Internet!? (fwd) 
It's quite a jolt, to see one's post on one list (FutureCulture) pop up
on another list (Cypherpunks). Well, it pays to stay networked.  :<)
   I understand -- and believe I stated in the post -- that all these
efforts seem to be in the future conditional tense (or is it future
optimistic tense?).  But I'll repeat what I mentioned to Eric at the meeting:
  It jarred me to see someone so blithely planning to enter into the world
of international finance from an essentially "outsider" frame of
reference. As impressed as I was by the range and depth of Eric's
understanding of the technical aspects of encryption, I have the feeling
that setting up such a revolutionary scheme -- which would threaten both
traditional banking enterprises and the governments that monitor and tax
them -- is bound to encounter opposition much more massive and
sophisticated than he indicated.
  To be fair, he could only talk about the high points of his plans in
the context of the afternoon talk. But I kept having flashbacks to the1960s
and 70s, when counterculture groups laid intricate plans to overwhelm or
endrun "the system."   Put bluntly, any plans to enter international finance without a
substantial component aimed at lining up political and traditional
financial clout seems to me to be doomed to the dustbin of visionary
schemes.  After the smoke clears, we are far more likely to see Chase
Manhattan with a platoon of hired cryptologists than EFF or Cypherpunks
wheeling and dealing on a global scale.

@_subject: Virtual City (tm) and Virtual Capitalism 
I'm still not clear as to exactly what MUD money would purchase. In a MOO,
such as MediaMOO or BayMOO, I can't conceive of what anyone could "buy"
with virtual money. The one real item of scarcity in a MOO -- from the
player's standpoint -- is quota. You are normally assigned a specific
number of objects or features that you can own -- say, 20 -- and once you use
that number up, you have to prove to the wizards that you really do need
an increase in your quota, and that you haven't just gobbled up disk space
with superfluous rooms or little-used objects.
  Any system of monetary exchange that would involve manipulating quotas,
or translating them into a kind of tradeable commodity would, I think, be
vigorously resisted by most MOO wizards. "I'll help you code that virtual
Harley if you'll pay me two quota" would be antithetical to the whole
spirit of cooperation I've seen in most (though not all) MOOs. In
addition, it would be an ironic commentary on the old cyberpunk
"Information should be free!" if Joe/Jane MOOwhiz sets up shop as a
for-hire expert in coding, amassing virtual capital off of newbies.
  If we're talking about RPG money -- gold and jewels that have value
within a MUD/RPG universe -- well, OK; but I think this would be a fairly
trivial use of what I thought was supposed to be a sophisticated model for
future monetary transactions on a global scale. And if, as part of your
post suggests, RL money would be gratefully paid for increased power
within a MUD -- shades of *Snow Crash*! And who would have guessed that
it was cypherpunks in executive clothing that brought such a system into
the MUD/MOO world.

@_subject: Native American Encryption?! 
I remember hearing many years ago that one of the branches of the armed
aervices during WWII used a native American -- Cherokee? Apache? --
language to communicate. The Japanese (the story goes) went nuts trying to
crack the code -- unsuccessfully.
  Two questions:
  1) Can anyone give me a reference for this story (assuming it's true)?
  2) If one used a natural language for encryption, and the would-be code
crackers did not know it was natural language (say, Hittite), could they crack
it? I seem to remember that hieroglyphs were undecipherable until the
Rosetta Stone was discovered. But maybe current techniques would do a
better job....?

As the culprit who started the "Native American Encryption" thread, I'd
like to speak out in thanks and in favor of many answers to a question.
It's true that lots of folks correctly identified Navajo as the source pf
the language used. But lots of other details came in, one post at a time,
that clarified the picture, and made it both more accurate and more
interesting to folks interested in this fascinating chapter in the history
of coding. The fact that Navajo was originally all-oral, but is now
written; that the talkers used a compound of Navajo and on-the-fly slang;
that real-language systems are immeasurably harder to crack than encrypted
messages if you don't know they are real-life languages; etc. etc.

There's a thread on MOO-Cows -- a list primarily for folks interested in
the technical side of maintaining MOO databases (new releases of the core,
bugs in current core, questions about MOO-coding, etc.) -- that has to do
with passwords and encryption. It's been the fond hope of many people in
the MOO world that someone will come up with a kind of gateway that will
let players move from one MOO to another. There are lots of problems --
different ID numbers for the (essentially) same objects in each MOO,
different criteria for membership in different MOOs, etc. But one really
fundamental issue is: how can you use the same password to move from MOO
to MOO?
  I'm forwarding the essentials of the thread, plus one ambitious proposal
for solving the dilemma. Anyone here got any thoughts on the problem
and/or its solution(s)?
---------- Forwarded message ----------
    Somebody I know is trying to figure out a secure way to handle passwords in
    a MOO-to-MOO connection system.  The idea is to set it up so players can
    "walk" from MOO to MOO without worrying that their passwords are
    compromised.
    Something that occurred to me is that perhaps the first MOO could take the
    already-encrypted password of the player, and pass it to the second MOO.     Then a simple comparison to see if the encrypted passwords match.
    Does this work?
No!!!! It does not work, and as a matter of fact, it is worse than sending a
plaintext password.
The reason is that not only is your plaintext password a piece of valuable
information, but the encrypted password is, too. Possibly more valuable.
If you *merely* send the encrypted password, and then merely compare it against
what's in the database on the other side, then what you've done is manage to
reduce the problem of encrypted passwords to the previously solved problem of
plaintext passwords. All you're doing with the "encryption" is transforming the
plaintext password "alacazam" into "p9&5kgwqp%$3=l" which is less human
readable, but once snarfed off the net by an interloper, all they have to do is
hack up a client to send MOO2 a connect that says, "Hi, I'm an inter-MOO
connection, here's the encrypted password for Soandso." Poof, they're in.
If you want to have a secure login system you have to go to a little more work.
I'll describe a mechanism that is actually in place in a business oriented MUD
called "Meeting Space" today.
(1) Get yourself a 1-way hash algorithm. MD5 is good one. If you need MD5, send
me mail, I'll dredge it up for you. It's stuffed on my cognitive prosthesis
(2) The client to your MOO sends the server a message. The message says, "Hi, I
want to log in as Soandso."
(3) The server has in its database Soandso's password. The password has been
munched up with MD5 and also some random stuff, called "salt" in the trade.
It's there to simply make it harder for someone to grind up /etc/passwd and do
simple comparisons. The server sends back a message to the client that says,
"Cool. Do this for me. take the salt characters "fnord" and the string
"172355555" and grind them all up together, and send me back the answer. The
latter string is a quasi-random, non-repeating message. The easiest way to get
one of those is to call time() and turn it into a string. If you want to get
fancy, toss in some things like the number of pagefaults the system has done,
concatenated with the number of times that you've authenticated someone today,
and so on. The time is really good enough as it is, though tossing in the
number of times you've played this game makes it foolproof. The real point is
that you can't *ever* use this query again. How you construct such a message is
up to you. What you're doing is making a "one-time pad" in the lingo. (4) The client does all of this, using MD5 to grind up the plaintext password,
and the extra stuff (the client doesn't really need to know what the meaning of
the extra stuff is, it just has to grind it all up), and sends the server back
the result.
(5) The server mixes up the extra stuff with its already-hashed password and
compares the result to what the client sent. If they match, the client gets in.
If not, the server sends back a message that says, "No, sorry."
There are many other possible algorithms. The trick in thinking about them is
to assume that there are other people are listening. In our case, assume
there's an eavesdropper, with total knowledge of the algorithm. What have they
learned? Well, they learned what the system time on the server was. No harm in
that. They learned the client's password's salt. This is mildly irksome, but
only mildly. This potentially makes it easier for them to use a dictionary-
attack on the password, but not really. For anything that's really useful, it's
*far* easier for them to figure out how to hijack the whole database. All they
really know is that every time you log in, the magic question is going to have
a constant in it. Big deal.
Note that while not perfect, all forms of attack on this system involve both
hacking up a client and stealing the server's database. While not an
unattainable task, an authentication system like this is *more* secure than the
authentication system used to let you log into a privileged account on the host
operating system, even ones as reasonably secure as unix and VMS.
How's this, clear as mud?
Unsolved problems (left as an exercise to the reader):
(1) Securely changing Soandso's password in the presence of eavesdroppers.
(2) Managing the plaintext password on the client system (which is required

@_subject: Cypherwaffle on spoofing 
I understand Detweiller's frustration. On another list, someone posted as if he/she were William Gibson. That kind of fraud undermines confidence on several levels. It attempts to dupe us, and usurps the name and reputation of a well-known writer, and sets up an atmosphere of suspicion and doubt fatal to any community.   How would you like it if someone spoofmailed  to this list under your name, then published Nazi slogans and argued for the legalization of rape?   What I find odd is the number and  vehemence of posts ON A LIST DEVOTED TO ENCRYPTION saying "Hey, it's a  fact of life, accept it" -- even  dragging out Machiavelli's profoundly  mistaken "if you can't enforce it,  don't prohibit it." Of all the groups  on the Internet, I would think that  this one would be in a special position to say "put your digital John Hancock on your post if you want to to taken seriously."

@_author: Arthur Chandler 
@_subject: Anonymity versus Responsibility 
It still seems to me that the spoofing issue has been oversimplified:
  "Hey, it's a fact of life. Accept it."
  "We're cypherpunks. We have a little fun once in a while. Lighten up!"
  "Spoofing and deception are not the same."
  Then Boxx gets dinged for using spoofs, and Detweiler gets dinged for objecting to them.
  Then May comes out with a G-rated spoof, and everyone (almost) has a chuckle.   But I think the issue is too sticky to pass off with flames and grins.
As I see it, the spoofing touches on one of the basic opportunities/dilemmas of the NET: anonymity versus responsibility. We can say things behind the cover of ascii that we wouldn't dare try IRL. So some folks do it. You can explore gender bending, being an asshole, etc. -- and no one has to know. Good therapy? Food for the exploring mind? Yeah, maybe. But also --
  Good for undermining credibility. Someone spoofs in a letter from William Gibson during a heated discussion of Cyberpunk. It LOOKS plausible. No one on the list knows Gibson personally. Do you take it at face value, or pass it off as a possible spoof? Folks, that ain't spoofing: it's impersonation. It's a form of lying. No harm done? Ask Gibson if he thinks so. Ask yourself if you would.
  Situation  someone writes in a bunch of outrageous opinions and puts YOUR name in the sender slot and fires the mess of to the cypherpunks list. What are you going to do about it? Quickly  post a denial, no doubt. But tell me you wouldn't feel furious. Someone  has used anonymity to misrepresent you. In essence, to lie about you in  an ingenious way made possible by a combo of human nature and the structure of the NET.
  So: You want to post/pose as *HeAvYd00d* -- hey, go right ahead. That's your biz, and I can  use a laugh (the whole scheme of building up an anonymous rep seems like juvenile fantasy or disguised cowardice, but chacun a son gout). You want to pose as William Gibson?  I've got a problem with  that -- and so do you, if the real WG finds out. You want to pose as  someone else on this list? Well, do YOU have a problem with that?

Cheers for this note of sanity and compassion -- also proposed by Hal
Finney. Why can't we just discuss the pros and cons of the
spoofing/pseudonymity issue without flaming someone who feels very
passionately about the issue? The very vehemence of the discussion clearly
indicates that LD hit some nerves, and that fact alone should alert us to
try to consider the matter -- and post our replies -- dispassionately. Or,
if passion there must be, direct it to the issues, and not the people who
disagree with us.

Can't we be a little nicer, and talk about the ISSUES instead of the posters?   Let's agree that spoofing/anonymity is no good if (1) you post as William Gibson and you're NOT William Gibson, or (2) you post as LD, TM, AC, EH, or anyone else on this list if you are not that person. (1) and (2) aren't instances of spoofing: they're instances of impersonation and    Anyone got a problem with all that?
   OK, on to the next issue:
   Why would you want to build up a pseudonymous reputation?     I ask this question not in a contentious manner, but out of a real desire to turn the discussion into a thread where encryption, privacy, alternate identities, etc. can be talked about in a lively, but not angry fashion.
   (Hmmm, that sounded kinda pompous; but bear with me!)
   Isn't it tough enough to build up a rep under our real names? What is the point to using a pseudonym? I can think of some bad reasons; but I can't come up with any good ones, except for "fun" and "just to see what it feels like to put out opinions not my own."  I'm sure I'm missing the point; so, before you jump on me as a Clueless Newbie, can you run by the reasons why you want to have alternate personas on the NET?
   A story to lighten up the atmosphere:
   On MediaMOO, I have a virtual puppet. I've coded the puppet -- named Apprentice Dragon -- to follow me around; and I can speak or emote through him too. Regulars on MediaMOO know he's my puppet; newbies are amazed at first, but soon learn to identify the puppet with its owner. Now, a couple of weeks ago I was in the middle of a heavy Real Time discussion at MediaMOO. I offered an opinion; then, just for the heck of it, I had the Apprentice Dragon contradict me. And danged if everyone didn't agree with the dragon!    Maybe this is a lesson I should apply to pseudonymous identities.
   Or maybe not.
   So why try for a pseudonymous rep? All replies cheerfully considered.

@_subject: Re: ID of anonymous posters via word analysis? 
I remember reading some time ago that the Nazis had a method of trapping communists that went like this:
  They'd put the suspect in  room and carry on a conversation with him (all males, as I remember). Then, after several hours of conversation about any and all kinds of subjects, they would tote up the number of times that the suspect used the word "concrete" -- evidently a favorite left-wing buzzword in the '30s. If the "concrete" cropped up frequently .... off to camp went the suspect.
  I think that identification by buzzwords, habitual misspellings, etc. could be used to identify anonymous posters. Sentence structure is also revealing. Le style, c'est l'homme, said Voltaire.  Of course, it all comes down to how much time and effort you want to put into proving, say, that SBoxx=LDetweiler.
  And the method is fallible. I've seen some pretty wacky schemes "proving," by word or grammatical analysis, that Shakespeare's works were written by Francis Bacon, Chris Marlowe, Queen Elizabeth, etc. It's very easy to be misled by your desire to prove something you're already convinced of for other reasons.

@_subject: Your mother's maiden name 
At least three places/organizations I do business with ask for this bit of info as a "security check." The idea being, I think that you mother's maiden name is something that only those intimately familiar with your family would know, and therefore is an easy, universally applicable kind of "password" to be used before handing out sensitive info.
 But I've always wondered just how secure this "password" is. Recalling Eric Hughes statement that "cryptography is all economics," and realizing that someone with an unlimited budget could probably scrounge that info after some effort -- just how much effort would it take? And how secure is "mom's maiden name" as a password for obtaining sensitive information over the phone?

@_subject: Private and Public 
I'm sure that few folks want to unsheathe the pro- and con- spoofing arguments again. But Patrick's last post got me thinking:
  Does the government have the right to know how much money I make, and from what sources? The IRS says yes, absolutely. But Eric Hughes, in a talk given at San Francisco State University, said, in response to a question from an audience, that international digital banking will make it very difficult for a national government to track monetary exchanges, and thereby tax them. Furthermore, I deduced from the gleam in his eye that Eric thought that this was a Good Thing (correct me if I misconstrued you, Eric).   Right now, there seems to be a kind of social contract between us and the government: it protects us, provides free schools, etc etc, in exchange for which we have to pony up a fair share of our earnings. It follows, doesn't it, that the government has a right to enforce its laws saying that everyone must pay that fair share of taxes? To enforce that rule, it has a right, under certain conditions, to rummage around in our records to see if we have hidden any income source from them.
  This may or may not be Big Brother. But it does seem to be the modus operandi of every government that ever was.
  The point: concerns of privacy often come in conflict with the larger obligations of public good. We can't say categorically that one must always predominate.   What do you think?

Hmmm... my post may well ignite some flames; but I can't go along with
the notion that this list is for purely tech discussion. Encryption is a
social and political issue as well as a technical one, isn't it?  I would
think that it's more dangerous to ignore the social and political
ramifications than to have them out publically.
    It seems to me that encryption poses LOTS of dilemmas for any government. I chose just one -- taxes -- for my post. And looks like there are quite a few viewpoints on that one, with regards to the government's right to examine your income sources. The fact the encryption schemes are classified as military  (or military-type) material and so are subject to comparable controls by  the State Department should alert us to this fact. So to insist that we  stick to Greatest Primes and Modulo seems... unrealistic.
    Of course, if the discussion seems pointless or irrelevant to you... there's always the delete key.

If the publication of this information is intended as a prelude to the RL persecution or harassment of Mr. Detweiler, I want to lodge a strong dissenting opinion. Mr. Detweiler's posts, made in an open forum, are his opinions on a number of matters relevant to the social implications of encryption and privacy. If we disagree with his views, we can post responses, or simply ignore them. Once anyone see's L. Detweiler on the header of any post, he or she has a pretty good idea of the tenor of what's coming. If you know it's going to enrage you, then why bother reading it?
  I personally think that, under the avalanche of rhetoric, he raises some very germane issues. I would miss him if he left. But even if I thought him 100% mistaken, I wouldn't endorse posting RL information about him so that people unhappy with his views could contact Mr. Detweiler's associates to complain about him.

@_subject: Irony in Detweiler-Hunting 
I see irony here, all right, but maybe not quite the flavor you discern. Like other folks on this list besides (but including) Mr. Dedtweiler, I too have some concerns about anonymity versus responsibility in cyberspace. I'm convinced that there are legitimate uses of pseudonymous identities; but I don't think we can shut our eyes to the problems that such capabilities give rise to. It's an issue related to privacy and, in some applications, to encryption.
  Now for the irony:
  At least two people have said, or implied, "Well, if Detweiler had just used an anonymous identity in his posts, we wouldn't be researching his private life."
  I don't know what kind of QED others might put on such assertions. But here's one translation: "If Mister Detweiler had been a hypocrite, I wouldn't be in a position to dig into his personal life."
  I still dissent strongly to folks  playing cop or armchair psychological helper for Mr. Detweiler, then sugarcoating the mean-spiritedness with "Well, it's an object lesson" or "I just want his associates to know what he's doing."
  To adapt Gertrude Stein: "Ironic, if you find such things amusing; if not, not."

@_subject: Encryption: A Testimonial 
For a while, I thought that encryption was just for folks who had something REALLY important in their files -- formulas for the Neutron bomb, sales reports to crack dealers, illicit love letters, etc. :<) -- so I never bothered. Then, before I left on a sabbatical from my university, I reviewed the personal files in my computer there.
  "Hmmm.... only class syllabi, notes, committee reports. Nothing here to... Wait a minute!"
  It then occurred to me that some sections of those reports hold very sensitive information dealing with retention, tenure, and promotion of colleagues. There were also letters of recommendation for students in there.
  "Well, no one's going to look in here. Most of my colleagues are still using manual typewriters anyway. But, just in case, I'll just lock these files up with Norton Encrypt." -- Not exactly a heavyweight program, but adequate to my purposes.
  Then, a couple of months later, I get a call from the Dean. The University has  decided to give my computer an Ethernet connection; and one of the  techies has asked her (the Dean) for the password to my files so he can install the appropriate software.
  Wants the password to my personal files?
  So I went out to the university and confronted the man. Why did he feel he needed the password to my personal files in order to install ethernet protocol software?   I got a song and dance about how some of the software "wasn't working right" and so he thought that I might have something in there that conflicted with the ethernet software.   "But why didn't you just have the Dean contact me to come out and look in those files? And don't you think that you should ask before going into someone's computer, even to install ethernet software?"
  His answer was this: "These machines belong to the State of California. You don't own them. The State does. And any employee of the state -- like myself -- can go in any time and do whatever we feel is necessary to maintain the machines."
  What a case of chutzpah used to cover up moxie!   Needless to say, I objected strongly to this line of "reasoning" and suggested -- politely, of course -- that neither he nor anyone else was to get into the computer in my office without my express sayso. He walked out the door affirming his right to poke around in my computer in the name of the state.
  So my files stay encrypted. And if anyone on this list works for an organization that holds similar views on the nature of personal files within an organization-owned machine, I strongly recommend locking all sensitive files -- or putting a password on the whole machine.
   I realize that such tales may have been told in *Cypherpunks* before. But there's mine, just for the record.

 ------- Forwarded Message Follows -------
   The brand new cypherwonks list on Majordomo is for
   ambitious, energetic, can-do, hands-on individuals interested in
   general cutting-edge `cyberspatial development' projects such as in
   cryptography, digital cash, and `electronic democracy'.  (A `wonk' is
   slang for a `meticulous detail person'.) The list is both an informal
   gathering place for the technically adept and also a focal point for
   branching off into serious project coordination.  We place a premium
   on membership by technical professionals and try to hone our posts to
   accommodate the busy (who, according to the adage, are those who get
   all the serious work done).  We are inspired by the Internet but
   don't see it as ideal yet and are particularly interested in
   cooperation, building prototypes, forging standards, and `long-term
   incremental evolution' in our designs and goals.  We're also
   intensely interested in following and influencing the technological
   and political developments of the emerging `national cyberspatial
   infrastructure.'
   The list is *not* for political diatribes in the `radical
   libertarian' agenda, e.g.  rants against all forms of government as
   oppressive, corrupt, or evil, or promoting the use of cryptographic
   technologies for subversive activities like tax evasion, black
   marketeering, or evading law enforcement.  The list is *not* for
   discussions of how to manipulate the honest through the use of
   software technologies.  The list is *not* for unconstructive
   negativism against other's proposals.  Above all, we are interested
   in forging a `civilized cyberspace' out of the current `Internet
   wilderness'.
   Historical note: the list was formed as a less ornery, more moderate
   splinter group from the Cypherpunks by J.Helsingius (creator of the
   popular anon.penet.fi anonymizing service) and L.Detweiler (author of
   many FAQs including `Privacy & Anonymity on the Internet).

There is an excellent essay in the December 21 issue of *The Village Voice* that talks about, among other things, the distinction between anonymity and pseudonymity in the NET (on MOOs in particular). There has been a small amount of calm discussion about pseudonymity on Cypherpunks, and I don't want to revive the embers; but the distinction the VV author (Julian Dibbell) makes between the abusive behavior often masked by anonymity and the more mature concern for one's pseudonymous reputation would make good background reading for anyone wanting to mull over this issue in print.

I realize we're all supposed to smile knowingly at this cynical remark;

And repeated threads may strike old-timers as rehash -- and therefore a kind of noise.  But -- at least as far as Cypherpunks goes -- even apparently repetitive threads have new slants, unforeseen shadings of personal meaning, and new contexts to save them from being considered as just noise.

TO: MEMBERS OF THE CYPHERPUNKS LIST
   Several subscribers to the cypherpunks list are involved with BayMOO, an all-text VR for the purposes of experimenting with virtual objects, hosting
conferences, and socializing.  On behalf of the folks at BayMOO, I would like to invite members of this list to an informal meeting/conference at 8:00 PST (11 EST) on Wednesday, February 9th.  Some of the topics:
   1) MOOs as environments for digital cash
   2) Encryption in VR environments
   3) anonymity and pseudonymity
   4) Others? Let me know and I'll schedule the topic
A special room, CYPHERPUNK CENTRAL, will be created for the occasion.    To get to BayMOO:
   1) telnet mud.crl.com 8888
   (NB: If you have a client like Tinyfugue, so much the better; but telnet works fine)
   2) Follow login instructions, and the help screen that tells you the basics of communicating and moving around.
   3) The following BayMOO folks are on the Cypherpunks list. Feel free to ask them -- or anyone else -- any questions about the place:
         blast
         cvoid
         orion          Yea
   4) Some interesting places to explore when you get there:
   -- Hippie Haight
   -- Improv
   -- the ascii atelier
   -- Frenglish
   -- the BayMOO TV Studio
   -- Davey Jones Locker
   If you want to come by and take a look around earlier than February 9, feel free to do so. If you want to get a permanent character so that you can make and keep virtual rooms, objects, etc., write to blast
   I'll repost this note, with updates, as February 9th approaches.

FIRST CYPHERPUNKS VIRTUAL MEETING AT BAYMOO
     The first cypherpunks virtual conference will be held at BayMOO on
Wednesday, February 9, at 8pm PST (11 EST).  To get there:
       telnet (or use a client) mud.crl.com 8888
 Follow instructions for login. Type help for any topic when you get into
the MOO.   Cypherpunk Central to get to the main room, then type HALL
to get to the conference hall.    One of the virtues of this hall is that there can be large scale AND
small scale discussions going on at the same time. Here, briefly, is how
it works:   A. People login and go the Cypherpunk Hall
  B. One person can assume the facilitator's chair. This allows the
facilitator to set several options for the room's function.
  C. In one mode, the facilitator allows open conversation: any can speak,
and all can be heard.   D. In another mode, the facilitator sets the allowable number of
speakers. Those wishing to speak must request permission from the
facilitator, who can set the number anywhere from one on up.  Those
wishing to speak must request, and are given a place in line; when any of
the current speakers yield, the next in line move up automatically to
speaker status.
 E. BUT -- and here is the ingenious feature of this
conference room-- folks can sit in any of 8 rows.  If they speak while
sitting in those rows and the room is in facilitated mode, only those
sitting in their row can hear them.  The net effect is that small
conversations can take place within the larger room, but they do not
interrupt the main course of the moderated discussion.    F. In addition, the virtual meeting room also has a built-in [about]
function. This feature allows all participants to indicate, by a bracketed
phrase in front of their names, the topic under discussion. In this way,

  This conference hall is still beta, so be patient if buglets appear.   I'll also try to put in a virtual bar for more laid-back chat.  The bar will be connected to Cypherpunk Central. Just examine the bartender to see how to order drinks -- or to concoct your own.
  Hope to see you there!

@_subject: Re: MOO: on the virtual meeting 
Thanks to all who came to the virtual meeting.  I was very pleased with the whole affair -- lots of good discussion, and not as much pandemonium in the large meeting hall as I had feared.  The big meeting worked well enough to warrant another attempt, as long as it is facilitated  by someone deft and polite at the controls, as Teknotroll was last Wednesday.  But I feel that smaller  groups -- 2-10 -- work better. Perhaps, as Robert Hayden suggests, a sequence of time-certain meetings on different topics would be one way to go.
  I also want to thank the folks for their constructive suggestions. As several people pointed out, MOOing is a much better experience with clients.  The good news is that, once anyone compiles a client on a site, he/she can put it in the public bin, and anyone else can use it by setting the proper path in the their .login file.   Anyone who likes can write to blast for a permanent character at BayMOO.    I hope we can stage another such gathering at BayMOO. It would be worth a collective mull to consider whether a MOO is a robust enough environment for digital cash and other financial transactions.

Greetings all! It's an unsettling feeling, seeing your own words come back to you in a form whose outline you recognize, but whose substance has so changed that you can only wonder how they came to be so transformed.
I can only infer that it must have been my suit and tie that so dazzled some of the audience.   :<)
  Anyway, here's what I thought I said:
  For starters, I said nothing about the demise of BayMOO or any other
place.  We run on a crl machine; but the owner has said nothing about
booting us off.  He seems to regard us as a good thing, and continues to
support our efforts. MOOs and MUDs have come and go in the past, of
course; but right now, we are in a definite growth phase.
  I'm a humanist and NOT a social scientist. I'm not "studying" social
interactions in MOOspace: I'm involved with creating the environments and
getting into both serious and lighthearted interactions with folks there. I think that MOOs have the capability of supporting serious discussions about such issues as:

@_subject: VIRTUAL MEETING at BAYMOO 
On behalf of the folks at BayMOO, I'd be delighted to invite the cypherpunks back for a second virtual meeting.  Our first session on February 9 gave a taste of what's possible.  Another session, with a cleanly organized agenda, could work even better. There are a number of cypherpunks with named accounts at BayMOO already, and new accounts can be handled in a day by writing to blast (blast is also on the list).
As someone indicated, MOOs work best with clients like Tinyfugue, though it is possible to do all right with raw telnet (especially if you have com software, like Microphone, that gives you a text buffer for composition before you send your words out into the virtual room).
  There are several options for organization for whoever will be putting the session together. There are:
  -- large rooms that can be moderated (speaker queues, separate rows for private conversations, etc.);
  -- smaller rooms for sessions with 2-10 people;
  -- mindspeak channels for folks who want to attend a meeting and discuss other issues on a channel at the same time
  -- virtual videotaping or autologging of the proceedings.
  The key to success, though, as the last meeting clearly indicated, is an agenda with clearly specified topics and time-certain beginnings and endings.  Moderators to make sure that speakers cleave to the stated topic seem best for large meetings; smaller groups can, if they like, let the conversations develop with their own internal momentum.
   Just let me or blast know if the idea of a second virtual meeting at BayMOO appeals to you, and we'll make the arrangements.

This is from RISKS Digest:
                     *******************
Quoting from the Feb. 24 News-Gazette of Champaign-Urbana, Illinois:
"UI student arrested for e-mail threat to Clinton"
     URBANA -- A University of Illinois student has been arrested for
threatening the life of President Clinton, U.S. Attorney Frances Hulin
announced today.
     Christopher James Reincke, 18, of Townsend Hall, Urbana, allegedly
sent an electronic mail message to the White House on Dec. 4 threatening
Clinton, Hulin stated in a press release.
     The message read: "I am curious, Bill, how would you feel about being
the first president to be killed on the same day as his wife ...  It would
be best, I think, to not continue with your immediate plans.  Perhaps a
vacation.  You will die soon.  You can run, but you cannot hide."
     The message was signed "Overlord" and purported to be from
     Reincke appeared before U.S. District Judge Harold A. Baker in
Danville today and was released on his own recognizance.
     Hulin said the charge resulted from an investigation by the Secret
Service and the UI police.
     Investigators determined the message originated at the UI, and a
computer trace identified Reincke as the apparent author, Hulin said.
     While being questioned by agents, Reincke admitted he had sent the
message, according to the press release.

@_subject: Who Owns the Words? 
I realize that a thread similar to this one was debated on this list a
month or so ago; but the problem has special urgency for me right now, and
so I've made the posited situation much more specific. I'd be much obliged
if anyone would post or email me their feelings, or references to legal
precedents, on this issue.    Many thanks.
   A dilemma: if you are writing a paper, and you want to quote someone's
posted (say, to cypherpunks) remarks, what are the obligations?
   1) None: by posting, people make their words public domain.
   2) No legal obligations, but it would be polite to ask permission.
   3) Whatever is posted is de facto copyright, and the person whose
words you took could sue you for breach of copyright.
   Now let's shift to a MOO or IRC:
   You keep a log of a conversation.  Would the same rules/customs apply
if you wanted to include that log in a paper?    Does it matter if the conversation was held in a private room or in a
public place on the MOO?
   Does it matter whether the paper is written to fulfill a class
assignment or is intended for publication in a for-profit magazine?

_COMPUTER LIBEL WINS ACADEMIC $40 000_
by Margot Lang
Sacked University of WA Academic David Rindos has won $40
000 in a Supreme Court action against Derby anthropologist
Gil Hardwick, who defamed him in a computer bulletin
distributed worldwide.
Dr Rindos' lawyer, Robert Castiglione, said he did not know
of another case in which damages had been awarded for
defamatory language on a computer message network.
"Computer users who use these worldwide bulletin-boards
should be aware that they could be exposing themselves to
defamation actions," he said.  "It's an informal system
where people say quite personal things, but making
allegations of paedophilia and bullying is going too far."
An elated Dr Rindos said it was the first of many defamation
actions he planned, adding: "I have to clear my name."
About 23 000 people worldwide, mainly academics and
students, have access to the science anthropology bulletin
board on which Mr Hardwick's message appeared.
Dr Rindos, who has a doctorate from Cornell University in
the United States, became the centre of an international
controversy after he was sacked from UWA last June.  The
University dismissed him on the ground of insufficient
productivity. Protests poured in from academics at
international archaeological institutions, many of who [sic]
described Dr Rindos as eminent in his field.
US anthropologist Hugh Jarvis put his protest in a message
on the computer network.  Three days later an answering
message appeared from Mr Hardwick.
Justice David Ipp said it contained the imputation that Dr
Rindos's professional career and reputation had not been
based on appropriate academic research "but on his ability
to berate and bully all and sundry."
He said that the message also suggested that Dr Rindos had
engaged in sexual misconduct with a local boy.  The
inference was that these matters had some bearing on his
dismissal from the university.
"I accept that the defamation caused serious harm to Dr
Rindos's personal and professional reputation," Justice Ipp
said.  "I am satisfied that the publication of these remarks
will make it more difficult for him to obtain appropriate
"He suffered a great deal of personal hurt.  The damages
award must compensate him for all these matters and
vindicate his reputation to the public."
Mr Hardwick did not defend his action.  He wrote to Dr
Rindos's lawyer: "Let this matter be expedited and done with
... I can do nothing to prevent it, lacking any resources
whatsoever to defend myself."

@_subject: Rucker on "Cryps" 
There is an unflattering picture of crackers and anti-crackers (and
crypto-heads?) in Rudy Rucker's new novel, *The Hacker and the Ants*.
Here's a sample:                      * * * * * * * * * *
  In the valley these days, phreaks were youths who cobbled together their own approximation of a decent cyberspace deck and afterward used it for weird cyberspace pranks. Cryps were phreaks who'd turned professional and gone into the employ of companies involved in industrial espionage. If you broke into some company's machines often enough, they were likely to hire you as a cryp to break into other companies, or they might use you as a security consultant to keep out the other cryps. It was a vicious circle -- the cryps' security-cracking escapades created a demand for the services they could provide.

@_subject: "Disclosing" private email 
Greetings! I'd like to solicit your/our best thoughts on the following
message. San Francisco State University is considering a policy of
"disclosing" private email to outside agencies.  I'm aware that such a
policy is yet another argument for using crypto; and the last cypherpunks
meeting gave some encouraging instances of "transparent" encryption
schemes that are not a hassle or a fear-barrier for newbies.   But if you could post or private email me your thoughts about the legal/ethical aspects of "disclosure," I'd be much obliged.
  I've put a few of my own concerns at the end of the enclosed quote.
---------- Forwarded message ----------
   I'm uneasy about the chain of "prior notice":
   1) Does this policy give university administrators the power to read
private email before the decision is made to "disclose" it to outside
persons or agencies?    2) Does this "prior notice" mean "We're going to do it" or "We plan to do it, and if you disagree, let's discuss it before we release it"?
   3) What constitutes "inappropriate"?
