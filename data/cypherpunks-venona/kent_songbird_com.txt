No.  The blatant spam and "Timmy isa" posts are more annoying than the large volume, at least in my case.  Moderation may actually cause the list to grow at a faster pace.
While I don't agree with your analysis in the short run, in the long run volume on the list will be *the* problem -- just due to the growth of the net.

I can comment, and I am not a lawyer -- I in fact know of one such case, where one large organization signed a MoU with another one that agreed that PGP signatures would be valid authorization for work orders and selected other transactions.  This can be useful where the organizations in question have a long term relationship, and they are willing to go to the expense of drafting such a contract.
Suppose I offer to sell you my car for $1000.  We are not going to manually sign a contract to accept our pgp keys on a contract to sell the car, we will just do the total deal with manual signatures.  Title will be transferred at the Department of Motor Vehicles with manual signatures.  Smog certificates will be signed with manual signatures.
It isn't worth the time and trouble to set up any kind of a special arrangement for digital signature for one time or sporadic, low volume transactions.  Not until there is a legal infrastructure in place will we be able to do that.
Not a chance.
We're not talking about standards for a company, we are talking about standards between companies, and government agencies.
All kinds of reasons.  A Title Insurance company isn't going to be able to use digital signatures on Deeds of Trust without court approval, to just pick an example out of the air.  So what's the problem?  Your answer is the problem:  "You hire people...You have IS staff...You can automate etc"
This costs *money*.  There is no reason to use digital signature
unless it saves you *money*.  A business isn't going to invest in DS
infrastructure, especially of the scale you describe, just
because they think it's fun.
This is a terribly simplistic view of things.  Businesses also
make good use of the level playing field that is provided by laws.

Uh oh.  Must of touched a nerve...
Sorry.  It's Edgar Peters, "Chaos and Order in the Capital Markets", John Wiley, 1991.  I'm sure you will rush out and buy a copy :-)
Clearly, you don't know what you are talking about.  Strictly speaking, chaotic behavior (as mathematically defined in chaos theory) is completely *deterministic*, not random.  The conundrum is that chaotic behavior *looks* random, and indeed, it can be very hard to tell if a set of data is generated by a determinstic chaotic procedure or a stochastic procedure.
Pretty pictures of Mandelbrot and Julia sets are generated by selecting points *determinstically*, iterating through a *determinsitic* algorithm, and looking at the result.  It's the mathematics that creates the complexity, not randomness.
(To be fair, of course, I must also state that some fractals are generated by starting with random numbers and running them through some algorithm.)
No, you described it just above when you said "just because a random variable is predictable within certain parameters".  So, for example, I know that if a head is worth $1 and a tail is worth -$1, my net worth won't jump by $100 on a single toss.
I don't know whether you are expressing your flatulent ignorance of
chaos theory, or whether you are referring to the term "trading
strategy".  I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume the
latter, and agree that the term "trading strategy" is at least suspicious. A lot of those, for sure.  But Mandelbrot did some of his first work
on chaos studying cotton prices with Hendrik Houthakker, a Harvard
economist.  But how about Edward Lorenz (of the "Lorenz attractor")
studying weather, studies of turbulence, Feigenbaum & Co at Los
Alamos, the Dynamical Systems Group at Santa Cruz, etc etc.  The pretty pictures are pretty, but even I can do those.
Sure, that too.
I wasn't referring to simulating markets; I was referring to studying real markets.
No, just a joke.  Boy, I must really have hit a nerve.  Sensitive big ego, perhaps?
That's ok.  I just attribute it to a fragile ego, anyway.
It's understandable that you might make this mistake, given your misunderstanding of dynamic systems.
That nerve must really be throbbing.  Sorry.
You don't like my example, but agree to my point.  I like that.  So now we both agree that "there are actual exceptions to the efficient market hypothesis"  (your words).
You, unfortunately, misunderstand your own example.  It actually is a paradox. Plenty of hot air around, as you speak.

   "Pierre, kiss me!".  So our hero grabs a bottle of red wine and

   His answer is good enough for Marie and things begin to heat up.    So she says: "Pierre, kiss me lower."

   They resume their passionate interlude and things really steam up.    Marie leans over once more and softly whispers into his ear:
   "Pierre, kiss me lower." Pierre tears off her underwear, grabs a
   bottle of Cognac and sprinkles it all over.  He grabs a match and
   lights it on fire.  Patting the flames out furiously, Marie
   screams: "PIERRE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!?"

Remember that since my world view includes numbers, Godel's theorem

incompleteness and inconsistency are global properties of a system... It simply doesn't matter.  The important point is that governments
*are* much larger in much larger countries.  We are speaking in gross,
general terms here -- we haven't controlled for type of government,
whether the military is included -- a whole host of factors are left
as free variables, and yes, even modulo those variables, there is lots
of scatter.  But in 1800 there were about 5 million people in the US. Now there are close to 300 million. The basic point, really, is that organizational complexity grows with the size of the organization, at a greater than linear rate.  This is because organizational complexity is a function of interactions between members of the organization, which is at least n-squared.  (However, when you consider that alliances form and can interact, the true complexity grows at a much faster rate.)

to be really precise, n^2 - n, since the relationship with yourself

have to be considered as a unit, likewise any three people, up to any
group of size n-1.  Clearly, any large group must impose some
structure to function as a group, otherwise the communication
complexity is overwhelming.  A frequent organization is a hierarchy,
or tree structure, and the standard rule of thumb is that a manager
should have around 7 direct subordinates.  This is all so basic...certainly it's kind of fluffy, because all social sciences seem kind of fluffy.  But the increase in complexity with organization size is observationally obvious, as well.  Compare big business to small business.  Compare Boy Scouts with your local street gang.

Unfortunately, it doesn't solve the problem at all.  In fact it
doesn't even address the problem.  So much so that reading these
replies makes me think that I am looking at different problem than
you. So perhaps backing up to discuss the problem a bit would be helpful. I hope you will forgive me if this is old ground.  The problem is key management for an organization.  The keys are used to protect and authenticate data owned, not by any
individual, but by an organization.  Keys are generated for the
organization's purposes, not the purposes of any individual. Furthermore, the individual privacy of an individual who works for an
organization is not a necessary priority for the organization. Organizations are composed of many individuals, some of which may not
share the goals of the organization, or who may indeed be inimical to
the organization.  And the members of an organization may vary widely
in competence, personal responsibility, and so on.  Thus, the members
of an organization cannot be trusted to do the "right thing".  [I am
using "organization" in a loose sense, so that we can consider a
business an organization, and an employee as a member of that
In fact, in most cases, only a small fraction of the members of an
organization care more about the welfare of the organization than
about their personal welfare.  So people will almost always be more
concerned about their own personal data security than they will for
that of an organization.  This, coupled with difficulties of
coordination and control, and the above conditions, means that in a
global sense information security for an organization will always be
difficult, regardless of the security of the crypto they use. For a moment consider the analogy with physical keys.  Consider the
key management problem of a moderate sized corporation that occupies a
large office building.  There are office keys, storeroom keys, supply
room keys, conference room keys, bathroom keys, keys to filing
cabinets -- there are *lots* of keys, lots of different delegations of
authority involved.  In many cases there is a "key czar", a "building
coordinator" that hands out keys, and gets them back when someone
changes offices or jobs.  It *has* to be this way -- you can't rekey
the entire building when a janitor quites.  So, occasionally it is
necessary to rekey a lock, but typically keys are just reused.  Many
office keys are designed to be difficult to casually duplicate, for this reason.
Of course any key *can* be duplicated, but that's not really that
important -- the building is full of employees during the day, and the night watchman checks each person that enters after normal hours.  All these physical keys all fit locks that can be broken quite easily

Not "best".  "Easiest".  Look at it this way, Adam -- if it was easy to implement Carl's model, it would already have happened, given the dislike of key-escrow in the cryptographic community.  But, when examined in detail, in light of real requirements from organizations, it is not easy at all.
I'm not "scrambling", Adam.  If there is anything you need to

motives causes you to gloss over my arguments and not think about
them.  I am sympathetic to your concerns, and I am trying to explain
something I truly think people are missing.  Think of me as intelligent, Adam, and I will do the same for you.
You completely missed the point of the above paragraph -- all those
questions apply to the "encrypt to policy-specified local recipients"
model, and *don't* apply to the key-safe model.  The key-safe model has no significant policy issues that need to be embedded in software -- the only policy is "when data encryption keys are generated a copy is sent to the key-safe (using an encrypted channel, of course)."
It follows, therefore, that if the master key is compromised in both
systems, all data is compromised.  From that perspective, the systems
are equally secure. This is precisely the point I was alluding to in the policy discussion
above.  In an organizational content, *of course* you will put all the
complexity in the MUA.  The question is, how do you change the "master key" indicator that is in each MUA?  Suppose that the organization wants different keys for different departments -- how do you keep track of which master key goes where?  How do all those MUA's get their key policy module updated?
How does the key policy module in the firewall get updated?
With the key-safe model the firewall never enters into the picture.
No, I wouldn't argue that -- I know perfectly well that that neither model does any good at all against a determined, competent insider.
Two things:  First, any crypto system that doesn't deal with protection/recovery/secure-use of private keys is incomplete.
Second, keep in mind that we are talking about encryption for an
*organization's* purposes.  The whole meaning of "private" is altered
in that context. You say "tumato"...
At that level of generality both these systems are identical, and equally easy to explain.  It's when you get down to the details that things become more interesting.

No.  I personally have not.  People I know have, though -- the survey was completed about -- um -- a year and a half ago, I guess.  So it is somewhat out of date.
That's a good point.
I'm not so sure about this.
This is one reason I'm not so sure -- PGP Inc is not a defense contractor.
If you believe all your employees will correctly use the proper PGP
incantation each and every time, even when they are tired and haven't
had coffee for 4 hours, and their kid is sick, and their wife is mad
about something, then yes, it is simple.  But of course, that is not
realistic.  Employees are forgetful, the organizations goals are not
their goals, and the PGP UI is -- well, I find it a little awkward, at times.
So PGP's multiple recipient feature is a fundamental building block, but you need something more in a crypto-client to be sure that company policy is followed.  It's that "somthing more" that is the hard part.
And lest we get into the macho programmer argument -- of course it's just a mere matter of design and programming.
The company that bought the crypto software for the protection of company secrets.  I think I said "who *in* Acme Corp", though, as a prelude to the following points, because with the multiple recipient model there is a policy decision as to which key in Acme is the master.  Yes.  To make use of this flexibility you now need a piece of software
that allows you to produce policy decisions, sign them, and make them
visible to all the crypto clients.  Another mere matter of design and
programming.  And this bit of sortware needs to operate securely -- you can't just any joe blow subverting it.  You are right -- there is the degenerate case where the master key is
fixed.  However, I would contend that is *very* bad crypto design.  So
thus you have the problem of distributing information about a revoked
master key.  (Your solution, below, was that you have a signed policy
statement.  If you have a security breach, and are revoking a master
key, how do you know what signature to trust?)
Furthermore, by encrypting every document to the same master key you
have actually vastly increased your exposure -- a key-safe can have a
lot of special-purpose physical and cryptographic security, but the
master key in the multiple recipient model is almost certainly treated
the same as all other keys.  For example, in the key-safe model I can
just hand someone the master key on a floppy, and it doesn't do them
any good, because they can't get to the key-safe -- it is physically
secure.  Next I walk into the physically secure facility (I, as keeper
of the keys, have legitimate access), and change the master key.  No
security problem, no documents have been compromised, regardless of
their physical location or access.  With the multiple recipient model
if I hand out the master key, every visible encrypted document is
immediately and irrevocably compromised.  So the key-safe model allows you a far greater security for your data than the multiple recipient model.
Completely different environment, of course -- I saw some traffic where they admitted that probably without too much effort the policy could be subverted.  But I don't deny that it would be possible to build a policy distribution scheme -- but it is a non-trivial problem.
Nope.  Not at all.  The policy for multiple recipients needs to be
interpreted by the crypto clients.  But in the key-safe model policy
is almost entirely in human hands.  It doesn't even have to be written
down.  Modestly secure example: The keysafe runs on a single workstation,
hardened similar to a firewall.  The only network connections are to a
single port, which does the cryptographically secure key storing
protocol.  When a key needs to be recovered, three trusted employees
troop into the room (three passwords are required, these passwords are
essentially the master key), and retrieve the needed key on a floppy. Other than the authentication protocol, there is *no* policy embedded
in the key-safe, which is to say, *any* policy the company wants to
use is ok.  It may take the personal presence of the company
president, it may take a signed statement from operations staff,
whatever.  No policy is embedded in software, and no software to
support software needs to be written. Not so, as I hopefully explained above, the key-safe can have enhance security, so that the danger of a compromise is lessened.
I spoke too soon here.  The key-safe model is intrinsically more You may not be able to trust the signature.
Oh -- I'm sorry.  I didn't think through what you were saying.  You
were attempting to guard against an insider threat.  A waste of time,
probably.  He could frisbee a floppy out the window to his honey in
the red sports car. How does the firewall know what is encrypted?  Just a bunch of gifs of the family?  Just the first 5000 lines of "Paradise Lost", slightly altered? Anyway, if the employee uses the "approved" MUA, and it isn't compromised, then it can store a copy of all outgoing mail, encrypted with the employee's key.  If he doesn't use the approved MUA, or the MUA is compromised, then of course the firewall protections are useless.  So, in the keysafe model, the firewall never enters the picture -- it is all handled in the MUA, anyway.
I agree with all this.  Only storage keys need to be in the keysafe.

I addressed many of your issues in another post, so I will be relatively brief...
Not true.  The activities are quite different in detail.  In the multiple recipients (MR) case the coalition keymeisters get together to decrypt a single document; in the key safe (KS) case the keymeisters get together to decrypt a key, which can then be used to decrypt many documents.   In the multiple recipient case, therefore, the master key is potentially used quite frequently, and hence much more exposed.  There are many other differences: I won't try to go into detail here.
The frequent use of the master key is a major problem, because in the MR case, when a master key is compromised every document in the company is exposed; whereas in the KS case, given appropriate security around the keysafe, it is not anywhere as much of a problem.
Not if the encryption client encrypts to different company recipients
depending on a policy (which one might want if one tries to limit the compromised master key problem described above.)  Then the policy, contrary to what you state below, must be reflected in the client.
Sigh.  The situations are really quite different.  In the KS
case the policy never impacts the software; in the MR case I don't think you can avoid it.
Not at all.  The corporate master key is used to decrypt documents in the MR case; in the KS case the master key is used to get to the key database.  Two totally different functions, two totally different security paradigms.  The old saw -- you can either hide your eggs all over the case, and hope not too many of them get found, or you can put them all in one basket and guard the basket.
But a relatively straightforward storage problem, really.
Not so.  You have to exactly the same issue -- how does the user find out the master key to encrypt to?
Arguable.  Guv won't say "everybody has encrypt every file to the
government key".  Instead they will insist that the corporate master
key be escrowed.  Any master key is an easy target.  And they will
have very good excuses for it -- corporations are public entities, tax
records, etc, so I don't think the public will get worked up about it.  Corporations won't, either.
Note that the keysafe model doesn't really need a master key -- it will work with just good physical security.  In that case the Gov would just issue a subpoena, I guess.

Your secretary of many years changes her passphrase, then forgets it. She has literally thousands of documents encrypted under that key. You tell her "There was a memo I put out two years ago -- we
formulated a quote for them, and *I need that number*." So you call in
the company security officer to decrypt all those documents, which are filed in several different places?  Contrast this with just restoring the key.
The models I have assumed are: KS -- a single keysafe and multiple clients; MR -- a single master key generating point, and multiple clients.  In the KS model all the clients talk to a single server, and there is no policy issue.  In the MR case, if there is a single master key there is no policy issue that impacts the clients, but if there are multiple master keys then different clients are configured differently, according to the policy, and that configuration is controlled centrally.
I confess that I hadn't considered the case of multiple keysafes in
the same organization -- and for very large organizations you might
want to do that.  But the whole point of a keysafe is that you
concentrate expense protecting the keysafe, and, in practice, it seems
to me, the boundaries between keysafe domains (to coin a term) would
be pretty well defined.  And, the only policy issue for KS clients is which keysafe to talk to.  This is pretty much fixed at installation time. You *could* design a system with multiple distributed keysafes, perhaps in an effort to minimize exposure, but I think this would be the worst of both worlds.
I don't disagree that you *could* do it.  I think it unlikely that you
would do it for the multiple recipient case.  I believe that in the MR
case the master key(s) (especially if there are multiple master keys)
would use exactly the same encryption algorithm as the normal
encryption case.  That is the obvious, straightforward way to do it. If you use another encryption algorithm for the master then you have a
whole raft of other problems to deal with.
And it would be crazy to require the presence of N people to decrypt any file with the master key -- consider the case of your secretary...
??  How do you know that the channel through which you get the master key in the MR case is secure?  You surely don't just pull it off the net.  It's signed?  Then the problem just recurses -- how do you know the signature is good?  This is exactly the problem you have contacting the keysafe.

Your estimate seems high to me.  But it is meaningless, in any case.
First of all, it neglects to consider that governments may have prevented more murders than they caused.  This is unknowable, since we don't have any worthwhile control cases.  (I suppose we
might examine a state of anarchic chaos (eg Rawanda) and compare the percentage of murders...but such cases are symptoms of other human ills, and cannot be used as a meaningful comparison, I believe.)
Second, such cases of civil breakdown aside, all humans, for now and
for the conceivable future, live within the context of some kind of
government.  The option of non-government simply doesn't exist.  The issue is how can governments be improved.
Third, murders caused by governments can't really be separated from
murders caused by individuals.  That is, in many cases deciding
whether a murder is a personal action or a government action is
impossible. Fourth, it's fashionable in these circles to paint all governments
with the same brush, but in fact, some are much better than others.  But it only takes one bad one to start a war.  Furthermore, human motivations are complex and irrational, so wars are started for essentially insane reasons.  This is a human problem, not a problem of government.
That inconsistency doesn't bother Tim.  To quote him:
"Some innocents died, but, hey, war is hell. Broken eggs and all that."

But I could raise a semantic quibble or two...I think that anarchy (in
the sense of a breakdown of civil authority) is actually relatively
common in wartime.  The fact that there may be higher level plans or
strategy by governments does not mean those governments are in
control. Human beings are fundamentally social/political creatures, and their
behavior is always conditioned by their social/political environment. It is my impression that when the "anarchists" on the list refer to
"government" they mean something more than the general
social/political environment every human lives within.  I personally
cannot discern a clear dividing line between "government" and
"society".

Hmm.  I did read, and I thought I understood this.  I claim that if
the remailers collude, then there in no anonymity.  Correct? Even if I
insert my own remailer in the list it doesn't help, if the others are
all in cahoots.  This seems pretty obvious.  They all compare logs, and saved copies of the messages, and my message can be tracked from beginning to end.  Right?
I see a list of remailers posted on cypherpunks periodically -- a
"cypherpunks" approved list, therefore.  Lucky Green admits publically
that he personally knows several of the remailer operators.  And clearly, remailer operators must share a common ideological focus...
There might even be a few honest remailer operators out there, but
undoubtedly they have been heavily diluted by those that are part of
the cypherpunks conspiracy.  So the odds of picking a colluding
remailer chain are pretty high.  When I send my mail the first one in
the chain will notice mail from songbird, and alert his buddies.  If
an honest remailer is in the chain the mail will conveniently be lost,
of course.  Only chains composed of co-conspirators will allow my mail
to get through... You will probably say that this was an insane conspiracy theory, and
that I don't understand how the remailers operate, and how
ideologically different the operators all are.  You might think that I
am ignorant, or being facetious, or that I am really just out of touch
with reality. But, on the other hand, you should be very familiar with this mode of
thought -- it is so similar to your "analyses" of the "gubmint".  You
are quite fond of clever caricatures, of sly and subtle inuendo, of
imputing slimy motives and conspiracies, of looking at the worst
in people...all justified by righteous anger, of course.  Of course,
to you righteous anger justifies murdering babies...("Broken eggs, and

However, it's not my prefered mode of thought, and I can't sustain it
for long: It does seem fairly unlikely that a large percentage of
remailers collude, and in theory it is probably fairly safe to send
through them.  At this time I can't really think of anything I have to
say that requires anonymity -- my comment to Lucky was intended to be
a light-hearted reference to my humble stature among the cypherpunks. "Negativity is an easy habit, often confused with sophistication."

I don't think so.  The fact is, of course, there are many definitions
for the word.  The definition I used might be called the "literary"
meaning, like the "anarchist" in the Conrad novel that always carries
a bomb.  It is a perfectly legitimate meaning, more common than the
specialist meanings.  But, having apparently stired up a hornets nest with a gentle tweak, I'll say no more about it, and be more careful around the hornets.
It seems to me that government is the only choice when the population
gets "large" -- that is, when an individual deals with substantial
numbers of strangers.  You don't just deal with neighbors and people
you know; you have to know some rules, and you have to be fairly
confident that strangers will follow them as well.  In particular, you need to be confident that strangers won't be violent.
Some years ago a woman criminal law judge from the Soviet Union wrote
an interesting book about the Soviet criminal justice system.  Your
first thought might be to just laugh at the thought, but Soviet Russia
had murderers, rapists, thieves, con men -- in short, criminals -- and
they had to be dealt with.  Many of the issues are the same wherever
you are -- what was the crime? What is the evidence? Who is telling
the truth? What are the laws and precedents that apply?  What is the appropriate punishment?
Criminal acts are a fact of life in every society.  In a stable,
relatively homogeneous society, I believe, a reasonable justice system
would always evolve, and that system would have a monopoly on
violence.  The population as a whole has a shared idea of what is just
and what is not, and the justice system actually provides it.  This
is, I believe, essentially independent of the political system. But back to "government" and "society" -- it's not that I think the
concepts aren't distinct -- like "anarchy", they are just words, you
make or use definitions.  What I was getting at was the reality of
things -- there isn't any clear dividing line where "society" leaves
off and "government" begins.  Leaves are a distinguishable part of a
tree; different kinds of trees have different kinds of leaves; but all
trees have leaves of some form or another, and if you remove the
leaves the tree will die.  And there is no point at which you say the tree ends where the leaf begins.
A cop has the authority to use force, but that cop drinks the same
beer we do, watches TV, reads the newspaper, etc; and his behavior,
including his use of force, is conditioned by all that social
experience.  At higher levels of government -- rich people hobnob with
congresspeople, presidents, and supreme court justices.  Businesses
have contracts to supply the US military.  Universities have contracts
to run government labs.  There are elections, initiatives, open
committee meetings.  All people who are elected or work for the government consume groceries and toilet paper.

Strictly speaking, I don't advocate government.  Rather, I think that
government is innate to the human species.  Chimpanzees and Baboons
have a political/social power hierarchy -- it's ubiquitious among
higher primates.  In fact, it's common among a great many different
kinds of animals.  Humanity has a much more complex and evolved power
hierarchy, to be sure, but the same fundamental psychological
motivation -- a "will to power", if you will -- is present.
Yes, that tendency does seem to exist.  There's an analogy to
gravity organizing matter in clumps -- each individual bit of matter
contributes to the overall effect; each individual human being contributes their bit of power hunger to the mix.
Who decides what are legitimate activities for government? Either the
"elite" or the "sheeple", or some combination thereof? Strictly
speaking, I think the "legitimate activities for government" is
meaningless -- ultimately governments *always* define their own
legitimacy.  To precisely the extent that you are able to effectively
discuss the "legitimate activities of government" you are in fact
participating in the power struggle, which means you are part of the
real government (just a small faction perhaps...)
Note that the cryptoanarchy electronic money agenda is just another
power play that uses privacy rhetoric as a smokescreen for it's real purpose, namely, empowering an elite.  Money, after all, is a powerful weapon.
The drug war is an expression of collective idiocy, IMO -- one of
many.  The military-industrial complex is a good, concrete example
that government and society are inseperable.  The point about the
fraction of my tax dollars -- the fact of the matter is that we are
all *much* better off than we would have been 200 years ago, that
society as a whole is more productive, and as indivuals we get far
more back from the society/government we live in than we could ever
possibly contribute.  "The System" as a whole could be more efficient,
certainly, but it's hard to make meaningful comparisons with things
200 years ago. Which is obvious, if you look at the primate origins.

Your analogy is flawed in many ways.  1) The entities entering your house have an identity; what is actually entering your computer equipment is just bits, which have no identity.  Spamfords bits are no different than anyone elses.  2) By the very act of connecting to the network you agree to recieve any bits that are automatically routed to you.
You are perfectly free to disconnect your computer from the net.  You
are free to try to find a provider that guarantees not to pass any

that specifies special rights, when you sign up you implicitly agree
to accept the bits aimed at you -- otherwise you couldn't receive any
email at all.  What you get on the wire is a function of explicit and
implicit contractual obligations.  This is true whether you are UUNET

Note the "automatically routed" clause.
The only way you can really accomplish that is to disconnect.  The interface/modem/whatever in your computer blindly receives the bits that are sent to it.  There isn't a thing you can do about it except disconnect.  (I consider turning your machine off as disconnecting.)
Jeez.  I *am*, in my small way, an access provider.  And, of course, I have a contract with my upstream.
You don't read very well, do you?  I said "automatically routed bits".  You can't stop receiveing those bits unless you turn your machine off.
Yes, because the network layer negotiation doesn't complete the connection, and the other side agrees to stop sending.  Basically, you have convinced the other side to stop sending.  You still receive any bits on the wire, and the only way you can stop that is by disconnecting.
Good, though trivial, point.  Not what I was talking about, though.

Once a bit is on the wire you either accept it or effectively disconnect.  Period.  If you (or your lower network layer surrogates) convince the other side not to send, that's one thing.  But at the point the bits enter your site, you have no choice.
That's a false analogy.  You really say "send me *all* bits, and I will look at them and *decide* what to do with them."  Your firewall has to receive the bits before it can decide what to do about them.  Any decision about what bits to send and what bits not to send must be made externally to you -- your equipment and software automatically receives every single bit sent to it.
You have to receive the bits before you bounce them.
As far as turning off your sendmail daemon -- that is just moving the
discussion up a protocol level.  You are still stuck with the choice
of accepting all mail, or disconnecting and receiving none -- if you
elect to receive any mail you receive it all.  Once you get it, you
can decide to throw it away, but you still have to receive it to make
that decision.
This is the conundrum of spam.  It exploits a fundamental weakness in
our communication protocols, and illustrates a fundamental
philosophical problem in the realm of freedom of speech through a
finite bandwidth communication channel -- what happens when someone
uses their freedom of speech to overload the channel, thus interfering
with everyone else's freedom of speech? (An information theoretic
"tragedy of the commons".)
Clearly, it seems to me, freedom of speech should not include the
freedom to destroy others freedom of speech by overloading the
channel.  But to avoid this problem you need protocols that govern
access to the channel...protocols which do not exist for email.
And even if you develop such protocols you still have the channel overload problem.  You can only read so much email a day -- your human input bandwidth is limited.  The supply of interesting email is essentially unlimited.

Quite so.  The issue, then, is "what is speech".  I put a 190 db megaphone next to your head and scream into it, and your eardrums rupture and the blood flows, that's arguably not speech.
I would argue that in order for something to fall under the absolute protections free speech it has to meet certain characteristics -- it can't lead to direct bodily harm, or property damage, or any other kind of "damage" that is legally defined.
So the question of free speech is really, when you think about it, a question about what legally constitutes "damage".
In the internet context, then, activities that cause any reasonable definition of "damage" could be controlled, under the "non-aggression principle" if nothing else.
I think a reasonable definition of damage in an internet context is "excess interference with other transmission" (for some values of excess).

Drug regulation muddies the waters quite a bit -- the issue is

"enforcer of contracts".  Contracts are special documents that by
their very nature involve "enforcement".  What you say in a contract

being impinged.
The fact is, a contract, by definition, implies that there are remedies, and an authority to enforce those remedies.  Furthermore, the rules that the authority uses need to be clear and explicit, and people entering into contracts under that authority better follow those rules.  In particular, they would be well advised to use speech in the contract that the authority understands.

A good point.  However, I only used one telegraphic sentence to
express my thought, not an essay such as you would write.  I don't
have time to write an essay, but let me try to add at least a little more.  Hopefully you can fill in the blanks.
Clearly, in this context "harm" would be actually defined through
laws, and some other term should be used.  Let me qualify it as "unfair harm", realizing that it's still probably not a good term.
"Unfair harm" (as I imagine this legal infrastructure to be) cannot
occur if it is a result of a consciously accepted risk.  Thus, for
example, if you engage in the game of business you consciously accept
the rules and risks of the game.  A competitor who advertises better
prices is not creating "unfair harm".
The point of this exercise is to move the debate from what kind of
speech is protected to a debate about what constitutes "unfair harm". That is, all speech is free, period.  If you cause "unfair harm",
however, you are responsible for it, whether it comes from speech or
from action. So, for example, rather than debating whether "true speech" is
protected, we ask whether a particular case of "true speech" caused
"unfair harm".  In questionable cases we don't agonize over whether
some artificial class of speech is free -- instead we argue over
whether the harm was "fair" or not.
Why change the terms of the debate?  Because it restores freedom of speech as an absolute, and places all the fuzzy stuff somewhere ["ontological"?  What do you mean by that? (Ontology -- the study of the nature of existence?]

I didn't say that all ads were contracts.  It seems to me, though,
that there is no clear dividing line possible between advertising and
verbal contracts, and that the clause you mention in the used car case is indirect evidence in support of this -- car companies consider it prudent, after all, to get you to sign something that relinquishes your right to hold a salesman to what he says.
I believe the ambiguity between ad and verbal contract is unavoidable
in principle.  Can you suggest any simple clear rule that works?

I understand that part almost perfectly, I daresay.  It's the rest of the sentence that is subject to various interpretations.
The wording of the second amendment is strange, and I have read
several highly opinionated pieces about what it means.  I also read
relevant sections of the Federalist/Anti-Federalist papers.
First of all, consider what it does not say.  It does *not* say "Congress shall make no law" -- meaning therefore that congress *can* make laws, as long as the rest of the sentence is observed.
It does *not* say "the right of an *individual* to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  It says "the people", a collective term.  It references a *well-regulated* militia.
Furthermore, this amendment was derived from input from two states (I don't have the documents handy, or I would tell you exactly).
There are caveats in both of the documents, referring to such things as "public safety".  The founding fathers were quite aware that it isn't necessary to allow criminals to carry guns at all times.
Therefore my interpretation is that according to the constitution,
there is a broad right for the population to own guns, but that right
is fundamentally justified through "the security of a free State". Use of arms contrary to the security of the state is not justified
through the second amendment, nor does the second amendment prohibit
congress or the states from controlling such unjustified use of arms.
Thus, the police can take guns away from common thiefs without fear of
a constitutional challenge.  And states, cities, and other governmental agencies can regulate arms for the public good, which may mean that certain individuals can't own weapons, or that certain kinds of weapons can be proscribed.
Here's an analogy -- imagine a hypothetical addition to the Bill of Rights, amendment -1:
                           Amendment -1
A healthy economy, being necessary to the security of a free
State, the right of the people to engage in business, shall not be

implicitly involves a set of rules of the game.  Inforcing those
rules, or modifying them in light of new circumstances (eg invention

No, that's essentially what my dictionary says.  The issue isn't
"infringe".  The issue is exactly *what* is being infringed upon --
what does it mean to "keep and bear arms", and who is being referred
to by "the people", and what is the meaning of the clause about a
"well *regulated* militia" (my emphasis).
I believe they did.  There are numerous other clauses in the constitution that grant powers to congress to regulate various things in broad and general terms -- those adequately cover guns.
Furthermore, the constitution only covers the federal government.  State governments have a whole other level of control over individual ownership of guns.
A nearby town recently passed a hotly contested city ordinance
forbidding the sale of "junk guns" in the city limits.  Such
ordinances are fairly common -- this case was unusual because it went

Here are some interesting clauses from the constitution, listing certain     ...
    To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and
    naval Forces;
    To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of
    the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;
    To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia,
    and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the
    Service of the United States, reserving to the States
    respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority
    of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by
    Congress;
[note: ..."suppress Insurrections"]
[note: the mention of the "Militia", and how they have a clear idea
       of what it is and how it is to be used]
    ...     To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying
    into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested
    by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in
    any Department or Officer thereof.
My reading of the constitution and supporting documents does not
support this claim.
In fact, William, though it may not appear so, I am relatively impartial on interpretation of the second amendment -- I own several guns, my family has always owned guns, I was a member of the NRA at the earliest possible age, back when their focus was responsible use and not advocacy for large gun companies.
My beef with you and Tim and the other gun advocates on the list is precisely this issue of responsibility, not ownership of guns per se.  Guns are not toys.  They don't belong in the hands of children.
[Do you think the constitution guarantees that two-year olds should be able to carry guns, BTW?  If not, why not?]
I refer you again to the "suppress Insurrections" clause above.
Perhaps true.  However, that does not imply that every single individual therefore must own a gun.  Saying "the people are armed" is not the same thing as saying "every single individual has a gun".  "The people" includes babies, the blind, quadraplegics, psychopaths, convicted felons in jail, Quakers.

So how is that different than the current situation without cryptography?  If people couldn't live with key escrow, how can they live with the current situation?  Answer:  they live with the current situation because the government abuses you describe are kept below the revolution threshold.  The same would be the case with key escrow.
But so what? Right now the government has intimate knowledge of your
finances through tax records and other sources, and has the power to
put liens on your property and your cash for all kinds of reasons.  And indeed, all too frequently it gets out of control.  But the bottom line is that business in the US continues to function.  It would continue to function with key escrow, as well.
Assuming certain models of key escrow, yes.  Under other models, no.  But imagine the worst case -- GAK creates a huge unwieldy expensive computerized infrastructure and associated bureacracy.  What happens?  Businesses find other ways to protect their data and transactions, huge economic inefficiencies develop, and the whole thing collapses and goes away.
It's amazing how little faith libertarians have in the market system,
isn't it?  :-)
Or another scenario:  A janitors at a Government Key Escrow Center is caught making billions illegally.  An outcry in Congress, laws are repealed, new laws are passed, etc etc etc.  If the system works badly it will fail.
Governments have devalued currencies many many times in the past
without the need of key escrow...key escrow is an independent issue.

Of course it would.  So would current bank/brokerage/business records. So would your personal records (if they were interesting) and money

be a easier target than some.  But (since we are here) Nazi Germany is
proof that there are plenty of other targets, perhaps not quite as
juicy, but just as viable.  And Nazi Germany is also proof that strong
crypto really doesn't do much good when the rubber hoses can be

In fact, your safety and wealth depends in large measure on the
protections provided by that government you scorn.  In any healthy

regardless of your little arsenal, and your money would be purchasing toys for the rulers.
Perhaps.  It's a mere matter of degree, though -- the point is that the government already has power to compel reporting in many cases, and life goes on...
Well, good.  That's my view of it, also.
Like shooting fish in a barrel, really.  Anyway, you know that I don't
favor GAK, so where are you coming from?  All I have ever said is that there is strong corporate demand for enterprise level key recovery. That's the rub.  You say "voluntary -- who cares", but fight tooth and
nail when customer demand forces companies like PGP and TIS to
implement some form of key recovery -- rather than face the facts, you
claim it's all government pressure and brainwashing, and advocate
employee sabotage of company products.  Well, there certainly is
government pressure, but there is *also* legitimate, informed, demand. [Your description of legitimate, informed, demand deleted]
I rather doubt it, also.  However, escrow of communications keys is,
in my opinion, not only completely illegitimate, but idiotic from
a technical point of view.  So, I think this effort on the part of the
gov will fail.  Some might see this as ultimate fascism...in the long run, putting the
force monopoly purely under control of those with money.  In any case, speculation.

OTOH, there is no necessity at all to think of it that way.  Prison isn't the only punishment -- there is nothing in the Constitution or anywhere else that says that.  (Certainly, not being able to own a gun is in no meaningful sense a "cruel or unusual" punishment.)  A court that can impose a life sentence can impose a lifetime ban on certain activities -- there is nothing at all inconsistent here.
Another fallacy is to think that prison is a temporary phenomenon. "Been to prison" is a permanent state -- it marks you for life. "Convicted Felon" is a permanent legal condition, a title with
permanent social effects.  You are probaboy thinking that after a person has "paid their debt to
society" things are just like they were before.  It's a nice theory,
but it's false.  It's not like money.  Your "debt to society" is not
paid off by a prison term.
"Let the punishment fit the crime".  The crime is *always* relevant to
the punishment, the punishment is *always* a function of the crime.  It

At one level, it is not.  Punishment intrinsically involves
restriction on rights.  Your right to free speech *is* restricted
while you are in jail.  Your right to practice your religion can be
infringed -- you may not be able to have a prayer blanket, for
example.  When you are convicted of a felony you step into a different
category as far as protection of rights are concerned.
On another level, they are *different* rights.  So, in practice, the rights to free speech and free religion are given greater weight.
It's really more of an issue of practice, rather than principle.  There is no disputing that once you are caught up in the criminal justice system your rights are constrained.  The constitution guarantees the accused certain rights, to be sure, and the convicted rather less.  But it is clear that the blanket provisions of the Bill of Rights simply don't apply to criminals.
However, the issue is very complex.  "The system" has a number of
discretionary points -- variable sentencing regiems, time off for good
behaviour, probation, parole -- all involve different levels of
constraints on rights, all constitutional. In principle, once you accept that the state has the mandate to punish criminals, you accept that criminals lose rights.  Period.
As an anarchist you may say that the state has no such mandate.  But then you have the messy problem of what to do with common criminals, and you end up with a state that you refuse to call a state.

@_subject: Re: Jeff's Side of the Story. 
This probably has been suggested 20 years ago, but wouldn't Jeff's
problem have been solved if the following slight modification were
made to the algorithm: If you are the last remailer in a chain, then
with probability p you pick another randomly choosen remailer to send
through.  If p is 1 end user mail would never come from you; if p is
0.5 then half the time you send the mail on one more step.  The end user, then, can never be sure of which remailer will ultimately deliver the message.
If all remailers used this algorithm it has the disadvantage that mail
could float for a very long, non-deterministic time in the network --
if p were globally 1/2, for example, then with probality 1/1024, a
message would float on for 10 more hops. But it has the advantage that the end user cannot pick which remailer
will ultimately deliver the message, thus making it much more
difficult to pick on a single remailer.  It makes annonymous mailing a less attractive service, since you introduce significant delays, and an increased probability of loss.  But maybe making anon remailing less attractive would be a good thing.
The non-deterministic retention time in the network could probably be
solved, but at the expense of some significant complexity.  I have not been able to think of a secure way to do it, however.  [If the remailers know and trust each other, the problem is easy.]

I wasn't thinking in terms of traffic analysis -- I was thinking in terms of guaranteeing that the last remailer in the chain, the one that actually delivers the message, cannot be predicted in advance.
The current remailer algorithm allows an evil user to cause a particular remailer to be the source of Bad Stuff, which makes that remailer a target of those who don't like the Bad Stuff.  The basic problem is that the end user is able to specify the remailer chain.
[Digital postage can't do much to solve this problem, BTW.  The
offensiveness of a message is not measured by the postage.]

@_subject: Re: Jeff's Side of the Story. 
Just teasing. I don't think it is so simple.  It is, as you say, easy to add
interior hops, but they don't do the remailers any good -- they add
cover for the end user only.  It is the "exterior edge" remailers that
are at risk, and such a remailer has no easy way of knowing if it was selected at random, or was chosen as a specific target.  At least, I can't think of an easy way.  A particular remailer may have cohorts it trusts to be sources of random selection, but remailer trust is a flimsy foundation.
It's a problem with any infrastructure, though -- once it is in place, change becomes hard.
The next generation remailer infrastructure should support a great
many remailers, and it should be impossible to target any single
remailer.   The infrastructure as a whole should be resistant to attack. This seems to imply 1) that remailers be small, cheap, easy to install
and run, 2) mail volume through any particular remailer should be
small, 3) the infrastructure should support transient remailers -- I
guess that is just a particular of a general robustness requirement;
4) the infrastructure should support volume restrictions from source
addresses -- for example, allow only 1 message per day from a
particular address.
Also, the "routing algorithm" should involve two stages -- the first
stage should be for the benefit of and controlled by the end user, to
bury the message in the network so that it can't be traced (unless a
secure retrace path is built in to the message).  The second stage is
for the benefit of the remailers, and controlled by them.  During the first stage the message is masked, and the destination address is unavailable, during the second stage the message is unmasked, and the destination address and message (probably) are clear, and the remailer network is trying to decide which remailer to make the final delivery.  (When I say "unmasked" I mean only at the remailer node -- not in transit -- the message is *always* encrypted in transit.)

You have to define "harm", of course.  It's realitively easy to
describe physical harm, but psychological harm is far more complex. You are far better off avoiding that tack entirely, and rather think
in terms of behavior you want to promote or not promote.  So, for
example, are children who are exposed to sexually explicit material at
an early age more likely to go to jail in later years? I suspect we
both believe that there is zero correlation. A more interesting case can be made for exposure to violence, of
course.  There is (perhaps controversial) evidence that early exposure
to violent imagery increases the likelihood that a child will be a violent adult.
Anyway, those who say that parents should just more closely supervise their children must either not be parents, or have defective kids.  It is a difficult job.  The topology of the physical world makes it relatively easy to keep
your child away from adult bookstores, if that is your desire, but
cyberspace has a different topology that doesn't support a natural

I think you are seriously underestimating the usefullness of self-rating.  Yes, indeed, there are people who will spoof them, or who may have a completely weird view of the world that allows them an odd interpretation of what the ratings mean, so you won't get 100% coverage.  But it is important to remember that less than perfect coverage is
completely acceptable.  What you have to evaluate is whether the
percentage of coverage is worth the trouble.  As has been pointed out, a large majority of sites that provide
"adult" material (under a very broad definition of "adult") *already*
self-rate -- their pages are usually (in my limited experience)
plastered with warnings, in fact.  And if there was a simple,
consistent standard for those already existing self-ratings it would be easy to generate filters for them.
Note that this is orthogonal to the issue of whether the self-ratings are government-mandated, and it works independently of government mandate.  The reason is that the larger porn sites are in it for the money, and *any* social sanction -- government, mail bombs, bad publicity, mass protest, real bombs etc -- makes it cost effective to do self-rating, if the self-rating is cheap.
More interesting than ratings, however, are techniques used to establish credentials for a large class of people.  How does one identify oneself as an "adult" in cyberspace?
If "adult" means "inhabits a physical human body at least 21 years old" then you have to tie a cyberspace identity to a human body.  This is a tricky problem.
OTOH, if "adult" means "knows a certain body of knowledge, that only a
person who was alive and aware at date X would know", then you have a
much different, and really, much easier, problem -- you can devise a
test.  Such a test should have just a few questions, drawn from a
large pool, each of which has a fairly high probability of not being
answerable by a child.

I agree.  If charging for mail would eliminate spam, then I should not

is in the best interests of the mail carrier to carry MORE mail, not
less.  So, e-postage will almost certainly cause more spam, not less. However, I think your argument here is faulty, because bandwidth is in
fact oversubscribed -- the whole system depends on each end subscriber
not using all their bandwidth all the time.
Not really.  A T1 line, for example, can handle maybe 40-50 28.8 modems going full blast, but a small ISP over a T1 might have 200 customers.  This goes right on up the line -- at every level bandwidth is oversubscribed, and successful operation of the net depends on certain statistical usage patterns.  So, while it isn't written down in a contract anywhere, what you are really paying for is peak bandwidth, not sustained bandwidth.

Adam, in all honesty I don't think of it like that at all. "Government" to me is a completely neutral abstract term, like
"organization", or "society".  Consequently, a statement like
"Government is always bad" is ipso facto a shallow generalization, and
my natural reaction is to point out that sometimes government is good. Since the poor brainwashed souls on cypherpunks uniformly spout the
"Government is bad" party line, the result is that comes out looking
like I think government is good.  But that is an incorrect impression. Government, as a general abstract term, is neither bad or good. [Note: While "government" in general is a completely neutral term,
particular governments may be better or worse in various dimensions,
of course.  But it is never a black or white thing.  The government of
Singapore accomplishes a great deal for its citizens, but I would not
want to live there because of the constraints on freedoms I value. But the government of Singapore is vastly preferable to the government
of North Korea.]
I don't think of government as a "necessary evil", either.  Rather,
I think that a government of some kind is an inevitable outgrowth of
human nature.  I think this for three compelling reasons: first, it is
obversationally true -- there are essentially no human beings who live
without a government of some kind; second, because it is in agreement
with all my observations and knowledge of human nature; and third,
because it makes sense to me as the rational consequence of the
existence of force as an interpersonal interaction. In fact, of course, the US generates a great deal of wealth for its
citizens, who are among the best off and most productive of any nation
on earth.  Of course it could be better, but it could be a whole lot
worse.  To say that the form of government had nothing to do with that
*success* is intellectually dishonest -- one can just as easily argue
that things are good in the US largely *because* we have a relatively
good government. Oh, "luckily".  No possibility that there was intelligence involved,
"Governments" is the wrong term here.  A more correct term would be "bureaucracies."   The growth you describe is endemic to any large human organization.

Sometimes it manages to metamorphose into something else.  But none of the characteristics you describe are unique to governments.

government, and that was the position I was arguing against.  But your reasoning is this, apparently: "Kent says he doesn't believe
it is possible for a human society to not have a government, therefore
Kent favors big intrusive government." This kind of "reasoning" is
rife on cypherpunks; may I suggest it is beneath you?
With that little thing out of the way:
Compared to what? Compared to an imagined libertarian utopia, or
compared to really bad situations (say, North Korea), or Cambodia
under Pol Pot? In fact, you and I live lives of unbridled luxury,
compared to a majority of the human race.  Our government has something to do with that.  Put another way: your debit governments for the bad things they do, but you don't credit them for the bad things they prevent.  A fair analysis would include both.
Re: my eating habits, above.
That's hardly a recommendation, now is it?
In general, no.
How so? I could have more money? That's a rathole without a bottom --
I have an adequate supply.  More personal freedom? The main constraint
on me is lack of time to enjoy the freedoms I already have.

opportunity to each individual.  In a "free market" a fundamental feedback loop is that inequality of
distribution of wealth increases -- this obviously follows from the
fact that it is easier to make money if you have money.  With wealth
goes control.  Thus, the ultimate end of completely unfettered free
markets is fascism, where the wealthy run the government.  This is

But this experiment sends my mind twitching off in other aesthetic directions -- your code was short enough so that it isn't boring -- if you had 20 minutes of "music" like that it would drive you nuts, and I would like to try some longer things -- a couple hundred lines of C code, for example.

More precisely, people only respect other's property when they have property of their own.  If you don't own anything, it doesn't matter to you what other people own.
The question is, do they have a realistic opportunity to aquire property of their own?  If they do not, then the crime will be there whether or not they get welfare.  That is, if the best job available is being a criminal, guess what?  True enough.  One possible outcome of eliminating welfare would be to change the crimes back to stealing bread to survive.
The dream is that if you eliminate welfare the cold glare of reality will force the "welfair class" to become productive citizens or die.  There are other possibilities.

The evolutionary definition of "competent" is "propagate your genetic material".  A rough corollary is that those who raise the most children to child-bearing age are the most competent.  In practice it seems to be the case, however, that intelligence and "evolutionary competence" are negatively correlated.  As I am sure you are aware, there are all kinds of evolutionary strategies...
I think this goes a little deeper, in fact.  The kind of intelligence
that leads to high technical achievement is not even necessarily a
kind of intelligence that favors survival under difficult situations. If society dissolves it is my belief that computer geeks, like us, are
not the ones that will be most likely to survive....

There is little evolutionary pressure on anti-survival problems that
arrive in later life.
In all honesty, I do not consider building up a massive private
arsenal a la Tim May as evidence of evolutionary intelligence -- quite
the contrary.
On the other hand, knowing how to shoot, and handle guns, *is* a
useful skill. Are you falling into the teleological trap? And if that's so, then you
and I are inferior to our forefathers, and your judgement is therefore
suspect :-)
In general, I would say that you are describing a remarkably
simplistic view of evolution.  Off the top, two things I think you are
    - first, you make the common mistake of assuming that evolution     has a purpose somehow aligned with your moral view of things
    - second, more specifically, you assume that evolution favors the     development of highly successful individuals.  This clearly does     not follow -- herd behavior, for example, is a *successful*     evolutionary strategy.  In human terms, "never underestimate the     power of stupid people working in large groups".
BTW -- halfway through "Snow Crash" -- *very* entertaining, though hardly a society I would want to live in.  Also, if you can find either "Half Past Human", or "The Godwhale", by TJ Bass (I think), you will find a very thought provoking alternative human future.  These books will probably be hard to find, however.

There is no doubt that sometimes "help" does more harm than good. There is also no doubt that sometimes help does more good than harm.  Platitudes like these don't really give one much real guidance.
So the farmer can die of starvation later rather than earlier.  The
problem is not with help, per se -- it's with the specifics of how the
help is implemented.  What do you think the farmer would chose -- get
some food now, and take his chances with his food production at a
later time, or die of starvation immediately?
A current case is North Korea.  Of course if you give them food it
will help perpetuate an evil government.  On the other hand, if you
don't give them food, lot's and lot's of people would die.  Tim's
answer is that you might as well let them die, rather than perpetuate
the government that enslaves them.  Others aren't quite as cold-blooded as Tim.
The welfare system obviously has all kinds of problems.  It's not easy giving help without creating dependency.  That doesn't mean it can't be done.
Yep.  I don't see this as the same category of trying to help people, though.  Rather, I think this example points out the end result of our adversarial legal system.

Product liability issues are more prominent when something doesn't function as it is supposed to -- say you are trying to defend yourself against a thief, and the gun blows up in your face.  This is not the same as assuming legal liability for when you shoot someone.
Arguably, even then you should not be able to sue -- the small aircraft industry has been decimated by product liability issues.  And I remember when Chouinard went out of the climbing equipment business because of threat of lawsuits.
My understanding is that warning labels -- even signed liability releases -- are of limited use in these cases, because, while you can sign a binding contract that limits your ability to sue, you cannot so bind your survivors.

Anyone can construct scenarios where the distinction is as fuzzy as
you please -- eg -- your best friend is getting you a new stereo for
your birthday, and is arranging a surprise. Ambiguous situations are a ubiquitous feature of reality.  You may think in black in white, but the world is not only many shades of gray -- it's a parade of color.
The fundamental problem is that people are different, and have
different moral values.  Some people think that murder is wrong under
any circumstances.  Others think it is all right to kill in
"self-defense" (whatever that means).  Some people think it is
perfectly moral to kill in defense of property.  Some people think it
is all right to kill if they are insulted.  Some think it is ok to
kill an unfaithful spouse.  Some people think it is all right to kill
in a burst of righteous or temporary insane anger.  Some people excuse
a murder when when the killer is drunk.  Each of these are honest,
real beliefs on the part of a significant fraction of humanity. People are not "buffalo'd" -- they are happy with a system that gives them a good life.  Therefore, it has to get worse before it gets better.  Ah yes -- libertopia.

You should go arrest all the Cypherpunks.
They are always saying "Nuke DC", but if that was a
crime we'd probably all be in jail, eh? Even us Canadians.
But they are a crypto-military organization, and some of them
have guns, which would make them a paraplegic-crypto-military
(At least, ? the Platypus would be.) And they make fun of Chelsea, too.
So you maybe ought to slap them around a little, too, after you
arrest them.
I'm a Cypherpunk, too, but I am a Canadian, so I'm better than
them because I still live in a free country and I can export strong
crypto every day, even the stuff made in the US, if I want, and
they can't.
You guys are going to make the US Cypherpunks criminals some time
soon anyway, when you hunt down and kill the rest of the Constitution.
If you arrested the Cypherpunks now, then they couldn't help people
to think and say whatever they wanted to and hide their using
the Constitution where you couldn't get at it.
I think its funny that you put a guy named Freeh in charge of
making sure that nobody was. You must have a good sense of humor,
eh? Me, too.
I tell the US Cypherpunks that "packing a suitcase"
is a misdemeanor and that "packing a concealed suitcase"
is a felony.
That reminds me...when you arrest them, could you let them keep
their computers in jail, so they can still post to their mailing
list? I like to read their stuff, because they are smart and funny,
but I want to be the Chief CypherPunks Spokesperson, and I figure
I have a better chance if all the US guys are in jail, because
it wouldn't be good for the Cypherpunks image if they had a guy
in jail talking for them.
Hey, do you know what happened to Jim Bell? Just wondering. He
made a stink so he didn't have any rights, eh? Anyway, I am going to send this by some anonymous remailers and
other routes. It's not because I think if you got mad at me for
being a Cypherpunk, even if I am a Canadian one, that you would
invade Canada and come get me. I don't know anything about your
drug dealing, like Noriega did about Bush (just what I read on
the InterNet. is that why you don't want anyone in the world to
be able to say what they want?).
It's not like you ever sold _me_ anything, eh?
Anyway, since you got a good sense of humor ("Those people
in Waco should have known the odds were against them in 'Reno.'")
I'll tell you a funny joke you could play on the Cypherpunks before
you arrest them. A crazy guy is writing a book about them and the double-secret
guys in your single-secret laboratories who belong to the Circle
of Eunuchs and anyone who wants to can put a chapter in. You just
send it to the Cypherpunks mailing list and someone puts it in
the electronic book. (It's called "InfoWar.")
Anyway, since they are making fun of you guys in DC, then you
could send in a chapter and make fun of them, too. You could even
be tricky and copyright it as "Anonymous "
if you wanted. That would be double-funny because then they would
think it was the crazy guy trying to trick them (because he's
a forager) and it would really be you tricking them by not tricking
them, see?
You could get even with them for making fun of Chelsea by writing
a chapter where she goes to their Bay Area physical meeting and
kicks all their butts. L.F. Freeh could even send in a chapter
about arresting the old grouchy one on the 19th, and then really
do it because of his sign. Bubba Rom Dos was always getting in trouble for his signs, too.
He's a guy in the "True Story of the InterNet." Anyway, I got to go send this through the remailers. (I am a master
of deviation.) You should see if you can guess who it is, OK?
And if you do, say so on the Cypherpunks mailing list, and I'll
tell you if you get it right, OK?
All the people on the list will know, but don't ask them, OK?
That would be cheating. (I'm not trying to imply anything, or
nothing.) Oh, and tell L.F. Freeh that I coined a word because of him. It
was a typo about him talking to Congress or somebody and I typed
in the word "tesiLied." It was pretty funny, so I just
left it like that. TruthMonger "It's not FUD until _I_ say it's FUD!"

every penny you pay for it, I guarantee.
  Although the ignorant call me a government shill (except for Toto, who
calls me a 'schill'), I am actually merely a 'pawn' of the government.
They pay my salary, and I try to stick up for them when I can, but I am
not going to cut my own nuts off supporting what are obviously criminal insanities that they choose to perpetrate on the citizens.
  If you are going to be a government shill, beating their fascist drum,
no matter what the 'cause' of the moment, then at least try to pretend
that you actually have some interest in the CypherPunks list which goes
beyond advising list members to mind their p's and q's, wear a suit and
tie, and call people in authority 'Sir.'
  Also, it would help if your 'cease and desist' posts did not convey quite so much a tone of desperation, as it will only encourage those
shit-disturbers who are suspecting that they now have the government
on the run, and it is time to go for the throat.
  And you are going to fail...
  Nothing personal, Phil, but my system has been the target of hackers
since 1989, and I have learned to live with it, like a bad case of the
  I do not wish to do harm to either the 'quick little devils' who live
within my pubic hairs, nor the nefarious entities who roam my system at
will. As long as they clean up their own mistakes, do not subject me to
undue harassment through their use of my system, or forget to pay their
union dues for hacking my system (there are so many of them that they had to organize), then I leave them the fuck alone.
  As a matter of fact, if one of the hackers roaming my system steps out
of line, the others take care of the problem for me. I can take a system
that has been hit by lightning and make it stand up and dance, but there
are children roaming my system who fix my mistakes for me, and leave documentation about their system fixes in my private email.
  To be rather blunt...if the government wants to have any hope at all in maintaining their grip on the citizens within their grasp, then they
must, like the Pharoh, kill all of the firstborn children of the God of
Computers chosen people.
  I violate a multitude of laws each and every single day. I shit on the shiny shoes of the LEA's each and every day. I am a doddering, half-
senile old fart who has probably lived long beyond my destined time, and
could well be imprisoned and persecuted for my imaginery crimes at any
  The mere fact that I am currently free to write this email without a
prison employee editing it before I hit the 'Send' button, is probably
a fairly good indication that the government is totally fucked if they
expect they are going to screw the younger generation through use of
a technology that the children understand, but the government does not.
  Governments fall for two main reasons:
1. They become two spread out to control their 'subjects'.
2. They start believing their own press. (i.e.-begin believing that
their own position of authoritarian infallability means that they no
longer have to tell 'good' lies.)
  A Player To Be Named Later, in a previous incarnation, pointed out
during the 'moderation experiment'/'censorship crisis' that the issue
being addressed was not merely one of censorship versus free speech,
but was a probing foray into the heart of InfoWar on the InterNet.
  Those truly behind the censorship crisis won the battle, but they
may well lose the war.
  They won the battle because they lost the censorship fight without
revealing that the true purpose of the attack was to test their ability
to engage the enemy without them discovering the real goals they were
striving for.
  They may well lose the war because they have trampled so much of the
Constitution with such ease that they believe that nobody will notice
when they track it into the bush and try to finish it off.
  Lying Fuck Freeh made the mistake of declaring his intentions, in the
belief that the past successes of fascism indicate that he will meet no
serious resistance in completing his Blitzkreig on the Constitution.
  The Nazis thought likewise, but their narrow world-view caused them
to fail to see that beyond the shores of Europe there existed a land
where people had tasted freedom and would fight to the death to defend
it for themselves and their children.
  The government currently holds all the cards, I freely admit.
  The government has laws in place that make every citizen a criminal
for one reason or another, and they have armed their coconspirators to
the teeth while disarming the citizens. The government controls the
media which rules the perceptions and opinions of the society that they
govern. The government has a million ways to 'get' the citizen who steps
out of line, and a million weapons to back themselves up.
  Although the government holds all the cards, they haven't noticed that
they don't have any 'hearts' in the deck.
  Perhaps the CypherPunks are the "elitist and nondemocratic" entities
that Alan McDonald (FBI) speaks of as presuming that "the views of a
knowing privacy cognoscenti should pre-empt the views of the nation's
elected officials." Yep, and we laugh at all the 'sheeple.'
  However, there comes a point where even the elitest CypherPunks begin
to realize that they have let down their guard and sat idly by as the
forces of fascism have stripped the citizens of their basic human rights
and liberties. And what the CypherPunks instinctively realize, which
the fascists don't, is that even the 'sheeple' will come to this same
conclusion, at a time that corresponds to their own understanding of
the issues of privacy and freedom.
  The CypherPunks are idiots!
  They are idiots because they still get suckered into believing that
basic human goodness and intellect will win out over the governmental
machine that has usurped the power of "we the people."
  However, there is an expression, "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me
twice, shame on me." The CypherPunks are not 'total' idiots, and neither
are the 'sheeple'.
  Those who castigate Tim C. May for his 'broken eggs and all that' stance that decrees that perhaps it is time that we "Nuke DC" do not
realize that if he was indeed the cold-hearted assassin that they perceive him to be, he would have taken that stance a decade or so
  I, on the other hand, believe that it is a credit to his integrity
and his humanity that Tim has waited so long to say, "This is a line
that I cannot cross--no prisoners!"
  It took the attack on Pearl Harbor for Americans to realize that the
Dark Forces were truly striving to conquer the world--that it was not
simply a matter of 'other' people engaged in infighting against one   When Lying Fuck Louis Freeh finally announced his true intentions,
Tim C. May was the first one to speak up and say that the time had come
when there was no turning back. The reason he was so quick to speak up
was that he already knew that the time had come, but he had the human
decency not to declare war until giving the 'enemy' every chance to
come to their senses.
  The mistake that the government is making with the sheeple is the same
mistake that those behind the censorship of the CypherPunks list made.
They assume that because you can fool someone once, you can fool them
  Unless the government has Terry Nichol's attorney in their back
pocket, like they did with with Tim McVeigh, they may have been much better off just leaving him be. Fool me once...

gently drawing it a little tighter with some droll comments about fighting off the assault forces when you were sleeping in the nude.

Shortly thereafter Tim started laying down heavy angry shit -- recall
the post about the bleached bones of the demonstrators being left to
starve, handcuffed to the LLNL fences?...and the angry character of his
posts has continued to the present.
This is part of Tim's personal appeal, I guess -- it's obvious that
beneath all the bluster is a very fragile ego that is easily wounded.  There are other signs, as well -- you mention them:  the dark hints about great and fearsome things to come, the recurring oblique comparisons between himself and the "founding fathers", the "I dare you" runs against the limits of legal safety.
Tim, like many, rationalizes his simmering anger by blaming it all on
the "bastids in the gubmit".  But it doesn't take much insight to see that there is something a little deeper going on, something a little sad. Sure was!

No.  Using ethnic characteristics as a criteria for attaching
emotional labels is racism.  If you have a gut level dislike of
Japanese (blacks, jews, etc), because they are Japanese (blacks, jews,
etc), that's racism.  Of course, I grant you that on a mailing list it isn't possible to
know whether the human Tim May is "really" a racist, so it would have
been more accurate to say that the persona "Tim" on this mailing list
is clearly racist.  However, the usage is common.  And also granted that the overwhelming thrust of Tim's writings are negative, so his racist comments are almost lost in the noise.
And Tim would be right beside you,  helping out.  Right... courtesy = censorship

You are so kind to enlighten us.
OK, so it is valuable to be able to "discriminate" between roses and
thistles, and squares and triangles.  And I'm glad that you think
"certain forms" of racism and bigotry are irrational and
counterproductive.  But the obvious inference from your statement is
that there are other forms of bigotry and racism, forms that you think
are "productive and rational". How about we forget your dance around the delicate shades of meaning accorded the word "discriminate", and get back to "bigotry" and "racism"?  I'm sure that a description of the the forms of bigotry and racism you value would be most enlightening. You make a standard racist apologist argument there, and it's still
wrong, as it always has been.  What is telling is that you make it.
The actual situation is this: racism is an emotional state, not a set
of words: you are a racist because of your feelings, not because of
your active vocabulary.  When words are used to express racist
sentiments they are racist words; when they are used with affection
they are not.  In practice, certain words are used with fair
regularity by bigots to express their bigotry; the targets of that
bigotry note those words. But the words really aren't the issue.  What marks someone as a bigot
are the emotions underlying the words.  When that someone is extremely
clever with words, like Tim May, it may be a little while before a
consistent emotional fingerprint comes through.  [In Tim's case the
emotional fingerprint is heavy contempt for most of the human race,
with special contempt for certain groups.]
It's worth noting that as an emotional phenomenon low-level racism and
bigotry are extremely common.  Anyone with a healthy amount of
emotional self-awareness realizes that they have irrational likes and
dislikes for other people that are triggered by appearance or behavior.  This is what makes Tim's apologia so pathetic.

No.  But here's a joke:
    The pope and President Clinton died on the same day, but due to an
    administrative foul up, Clinton was sent to heaven and the Pope
    was sent to hell.     The Pope explained the situation to the devil, he checked out all
    of the paperwork, and the error was acknowledged.  The Pope was
    told, however, that it would take about 24 hours to fix the
    problem and correct the error.     The next day, the Pope was called in and the devil said his
    good-bye as he went off to heaven.     On his way up, he met Clinton who was on his way down, and they
    stop to chat.     Pope: Sorry about the mix up.     President Clinton: No problem.     Pope: Well, I'm really excited about going to heaven.     President Clinton: Why's that?
    Pope: All my life I've wanted to meet the Virgin Mary.     President Clinton: You're a day late. I don't think anyone who knows me would say I have lived a cloistered life.  "Checkered" is the word that comes to mind.  Though I've been pretty stable the last 20 years. :-)

Quit a few years ago I was at a Cray User Group meeting.  Mike Booth,
a very bright technical guy who realized where the money was, and was
transitioning to sales, was giving a presentation on an idea he had
that Cray was marketing as "Microtasking".  It was a very large hall;
there were probably 700 people in attendance, largely white male.  I
was sitting way in the back; I had already seen the presentation. Mike was describing how the processors find work: "It's like a Chinese
fire drill." A slight figure in the front, about the 15th row, stood
up and said something I couldn't hear.  Mike couldn't hear it either. He asked the individual to speak up.  The crowd was quiet, and a thin,
heavily accented voice floated over it: "Please not to use the term
'Chinese fire drill'".
I have come to appreciate the level of courage involved.  It's not
like spitting out obnoxious statements to a friendly crowd of toadies

There are many circumstances that don't involve a circle of assholes

eyes in the back of your head, and can read people's minds, but I
doubt that, too.  The cold fact is, Ben, if I wanted bad enough to
kill you, you would almost certainly be dead, never knowing it
happened.  That's not magic -- you could do the same to me, and if you
gave 10 minutes thought you would realize this is so. All this stuff about always being on guard and being totally aware of

it's an braindead empty argument -- if you were always on guard and
totally aware of your surroundings you would never need a gun for
anything, anyway.

That's macho bullshit.  There is no perfect defense, and my example was to demonstrate that simple fact.
Please note that I didn't say that guns were *always* worthless.  So

Nonsense.  The ultimate expression of freedom is skinny dipping in a mountain lake.

libertarian is like the notion of "faith" to a Christian -- a
self-reinforcing mental trap, a span of circular thinking that is just
a little too large for them to notice and say "Haven't I been here

blind them, define their world, and trap their thoughts in endless
repetition. For all the brave words about reason and logic, and all the endless
discussion about it, libertarians don't ever actually sit down and
think "what does the word 'freedom' mean, anyway?".  Instead, their
thinking goes down to a point where they can repeat some mantra like
"Freedom to make purchasing decisions is *the* major component of
freedom in any advanced society", and they never realize the exact
circularity involved.  It might as well be "Freedom to worship the
Lord is *the* major component of freedom in any advanced society." Or
"Being a slave to purchasing decisions is *the* major component of
slavery in any advanced society."

Depends on what you mean by "damage", and what you mean by "liberty", does it not?
Using the quasi-religious meaning for "political liberty" that you
imply, of course it is impossible for for there to be too much of it:
"political liberty" is just another term for "The Good", and there can
never be too much of The Good.
On the other hand, if by "political liberty" you mean "activity
without any politically powered constraint", then, arguably, *every*
action where a bad thing, done by a person, could have been prevented
through the exercise of political power is damage due to political
liberty.  That is, every common murder and robbery, every crime of any
sort, is damage due to political liberty.
If you are free to postulate a perfect state of liberty, I am free to postulate a perfect political system.  Neither exists in the real world.

@_subject: Re: (eternity) Eternity as a secure filesystem/backup medium (fwd) 
There are alternative ways of paying for the service that do not in
any way depend on ecash, and after thinking about it a bit, they seem
more robust, as well. The basic idea is as follows:  The fundamental eternity service is free to readers, and is financed entirely by writers.  The writers supply the disk space, the network bandwidth, and possibly pay for the software to support all this.
In a little more detail: you have say 1 megabyte of data that you
would like to be stored in the Eternity Service.  The overhead of
storage in eternity is a factor of two, and you would like 10 times
redundancy.  So you contact the Eternity Service Software provider, and get the software.  You then configure the software to supply 20 megabytes of your disk space to the system.  This allows you to supply 1 meg of your own data.
The 20 megs will of course not store *your* data -- it will store
other eternity data.  The service takes your data and spreads it
across 10 other sites, whose locations are unknown and unknowable to
you.  In return, you are storing eternity data for other users.  If
your disk space becomes unavailable your file disappears from the
service.  (Of course, someone else could pick it up and store it, if
it was valuable information.)
This is a self-financing model.  Every writer to the eternity service
pays for their own bandwidth and disk space.  The eternity service
provider is financed by maintaining the software that all the writers
use -- client/server software will have to run on many different
platforms, some protocols may be better than others, and it might be worth buying your eternity software from a high-reputation ("trustworthy") provider.
Note that this doesn't mean that data suppliers can't be paid for
providing data -- but that is a completely separable problem that can
have many different solutions.
I believe this approach does solve the financing part.  But it does
make the rest a *very* complicated problem -- you have a dynamic,
self-configuring network of data sources and sinks, with all the
configuration data encrypted along with the data.  Ideally, of course,
the data would be migrating constantly. Retrieval would probably be very slow -- basically email speeds, or worse.  In fact, perhaps the data would be retrieved by having the eternity service use the remailer network to send it...

You must find the advertising business completely mystifying, then.
You pay to have your data disseminated in a form that you can be later
paid -- for example, leave the juciest part of the data in encrypted
form, along with a public key through which payment options can be
negotiated. Why on earth do you try to be an ISP, then?  You pay for disk drives for other people to store their data, and make it available to the world.  The eternity service is actually very similar.
Given a protocol such as I described, you could move to Data Haven
Island, and charge up front to supply pornographers with an entrance
to the eternity service, while John Young could wallow in righteous
ego gratification as he provides space for morally important documents
by donating his disk space to eternity.  You do it for the money, he
does it for the buzz -- there are all kinds of ways to get paid.
