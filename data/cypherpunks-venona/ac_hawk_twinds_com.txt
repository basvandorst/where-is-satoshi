In my post I am looking at this from an economics point of view. Simply
put: If there is unlimited liability to the credit card holder because
Mallet is stealing card numbers from the telco switch, encyrpted, plain text,
it doesn't matter, there will no users.  If there are no users then
there will be no transaction fees generated, no transaction fees, then it
won't be deployed.  Therefore, there is no reason to develop the code or even read the latest and greatest specs. and we are all wasting out time.  We must recognize that no matter what code we write, how secure it is,
it won't be used until the banks that must clear the transactions
agree to accept the risks of loss in return for their transactions fees.
I haven't seen this from any of this consortiums and would like besides publishing their specs for the best system agree that this risk bearing
is a necessary step for electronic commerce to become a reality.
I would like to see members of the MasterCard and Visa coalitions comment on this aspect of the systems that are promulgating.  The one who cracks
this nut first without losing their shirt to Mallet will be the winner. The
others that expect us to deploy systems based upon if Mallet breaks the system, the cardholder and or merchant pays is wasting our time. MasterCard/Visa,  you're going to have to *earn* those transaction fees in
lose money from using his card.   For anybody else that wants to argue about what is more dangerous,
restaurant dumpsters or telco switches, take it to alt.who.the.hell.cares.

Calm down.  This is why I started my post with "Maybe this is stupidly
obvious question but....."  I am trying to illustrate some simple points
and ask some simple questions:
1. Risk to a cardholder is on a vastly different scale than risk to the Bank Consortiums that run the credit card business. Charge offs and fraud
are of course as you point out a cost of doing business.  If it is not an acceptable risk to the card holder and the bank it won't happen.  The bank
won't deploy a system that they view as exposing them to unacceptable loss.
The cardholder will not use a system that offers him no recourse to recover
losses. End of Story.  2. The Bank Consortiums are doing a poor job of explaining to cardholders
merchants and developers such as you and me that are supposed to
implement these "open" specs exactly *what* our risks are in developing and
deploying these systems on our servers. The bank consortiums will have contracts or usage agreements governing the clearing of transactions in cyberspace.   When a loss is claimed by a cardholder, how will the loss
(if there is one) be allocated between the cardholder, merchant, the company
operating the server that processed the credit card and the bank be allocated.  3.  I'm getting tired of seeing posts this list about what is more dangerous
cyberspace or restaurantspace.  Let's focus on the real mechanics of how
the ground rules of credit card clearing will operate in cyberspace. The
credit card consortiums can advance the cause of electronic commerce by
stating in unambigous terms what their views are of these ground rules.
Developers, cardholders and merchants can then make a judgement on whether
those risks are acceptable to each party respectively.  Arley Carter

In this context is the merchant defined as the the corporation selling the
physical good for delivery or the corporation that is operating the server?
These two parties under certain circumstances may be the same party, but in this example lets assume they are seperate entities.
If I am interpreting "internet based stores" in the proper context, the cardholder and the bank have recourse against the company operating the server.  Is this correct?  Arley Carter

This discussion is beginning to resemble one about the telephone system
about 50 years ago.  A national phone system was considered an impossibilty
by many.  This is because even if AT&T  employed every female >18 years old as a telephone operators there weren't enough to plug and unplug all the connections on the all the switchboards. Arley Carter

This may be a stupidly obvious question but..... We could argue until the cows come home, hell freezes over or the Cubs win
the World Series, what ever comes first ;-) about whether giving your credit
card number to a waiter or an 800 # clerk is any more or less secure than
transmitting it encrypted or clear text over a data link.
However, this misses a very large point.  The reason I will give my credit number to a clerk is that the bank/credit card consortium will
indemnify me against losses from fraudulent use of my card. Tearing up your
carbons is more to protect the bank than it is to protect you. The risk to
*me* is virtually zero if I am a good bank customer.  I have seen no such statement from the Visa/MasterCard/bank consortiums
regarding who is at risk if my card number is stolen and used in cyberspace.
When I get a written indemnification from them stating clearly that using my credit card in cyberspace is no different from using in a local
restaurant, then I see no risk to the user in using the card in cyberspace.
The risk to the bank and merchant.......Now that is a different matter.
Credit card usage on the net will never take off until this issue is
solved to the satisfaction of the bank and the user.  Until this happens
arguing this issue is like arguing about how many angels can fit on the head of a pin.

Microchip Technologies, the "PIC" people, according to the grapevine is introducing smart card products apparently based upon Nanoteq's algorithm's.  Microchip calls it "Keeloq Code Hopping". Bruce Schneier's short description of the Nanoteq algorithm (p 390 2nd edition Applied Crypto ) is not too favorable. I'm not sure how code hopping interacts or is used in the system.  Can anybody shed further light on this subject and the viability of this
cryptographic system?  Arley Carter
