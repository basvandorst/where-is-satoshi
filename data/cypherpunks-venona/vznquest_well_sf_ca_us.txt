I just heard about the grand jury BS going down around PGP, etc, via the
EFF forum on the Well and would like to do whatever I can to support the
defense effort (when it comes) etc.  I am a writer with some small access to
local media and a big interest in the outcome of this test of our 1st
amendment rights.
I would also like to get on your "mailing list" if you have one.
Mail should be sent to vznquest
Thanks, and keep up the good work!
Alan Mason
