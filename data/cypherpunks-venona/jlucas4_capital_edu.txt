@_subject: Re: the word is "NIGGAZ"

"Niggus" is used often within gangsta rap music in an effort to rhyme with difficult words when no other way can be found.  "Niggas" would be referring to other black fellows in a friendly way.     More or less.  # Gangsta J              # "Dead bodies pile up, an' it's plain to see,  #
