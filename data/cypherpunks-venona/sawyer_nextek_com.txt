It seems that once again, big business is trying to get in the way of
progress and competition because they are afriad they are going to lose
some money.  It seems to me that the ACTA is upset because someone found a
way to "do it cheaper" and the telco's stand to lose a lot of long distance
dollars.  So rather then using this technology and perhaps lowering LD
rates, instead they seek to block out the technology from the public.  I
wonder what would happen if someone discovered an drastically cheaper
alternative to gasoline, but it never made it main stream because the oil
companies would go out of business.  Seems like the same type of situation
with the telco's.
No, the technology is surpassing the telco's ability to provide low-cost
Permissible communications?  This sounds like something out of the CDA ...
I say, just try and regulate it. I want to see the FCC try and monitor
several million computer transmissions every day and see how well
regulation works.

I wonder if they are considering any "artistic" indecent material that
would also not be prosecuted?
Maybe if Playboy remains themselves to "A Pictorial of The Female Body"
then it would be ok.
Just a thought anyway.
Thanks for reading,

Well, I suppose you could get it copyrighted before you hand it over for
distribution.  I'd also put my logo and other info somewhere in the code,
such as an "About" box.  They would have a hard time saying it wasn't

Ok, I see what your looking for now. How about tracking the number of
product registrations, either via a mail-in card or fax? I'm assuming
that since this is a product to be sold, not given away, that persons
purchasing the program would most likely take the time to fill out a
product registration card and send it in.  Since not everyone fills these
cards out, it is not a 100% accurate method, but if there were any major
discrepancies, then you would be aware of it.
