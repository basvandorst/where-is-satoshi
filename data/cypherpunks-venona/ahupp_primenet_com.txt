PKZIP allows encryption (other's ?).  How about a hook to that?

PKCRACK uses a dictionary attack. Anyway, my point was that you could use
PKZIP's encryption as an excuse for passing a password.

Check out
Its an article about the cypherpunks, mostly bullshit and hyperbole.  I
especially liked the parts about "Larry Detweiler" and this quote from Jim
Kallston, of the FBI: "We're not trying to stop technology," Kallston said.
"We're trying to collect information on criminals and terrorists and child
pornographers."  What happened to the fourth horseman Jim?

Unless you can post some proof that PGP is insecure, stop insisting it is.

I visisted their web page and what they do is record how many hits your page
I checked out their business partners page and it's no one I have ever heard
of.  Still, its kind of spooky because unless you notice the Netscape status
line thing you don't know you're being counted.  I imagine it is all put in
a big database and sold to advertisers, ect.

I guess I missed Alice's point, but I gave it more thought and Alice is
still wrong:
1) If someone DID monitor Alice, that almost defanitly means the remailer
chain was compromised. The weakest link here is the remailer chain, not
Alice's computer's physical security.*  If Alice's true address is not
known, there cannot be any monitoring of his/her computer (unless it for
some other reason than "Alice").
2) This whole deal is about Alice signing his/her messages, not encrypting
them.  What Alice would be giving up if his/her computer were compromised
would not be security, but identity. The most Alice could lose, IF the
remailer chain were compromised and IF his/her computer's physical security
were compromised is his/her's reputation by spoofing (loss of
pseudo-anonaminity is a given if the attacker gets that far).  Those are
some really big Ifs.
*BTW, the chain is NOT as strong as it's weakest link.  If I send mail to a
remailer, and it strips the headers like it's supposed to, but sends the
mail to a compromised remailer (the weak link), I am just as secure as before. -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

Why not give it two names?  A local name that could be a icon or something,
and a universal name (i.e. MD5 hash of key)

Sorry...I was always taught that the user should not
       be mandated to finish the job of the programmer.  Please,
       do not take me wrong, PGP is a remarkable tool...but I
       was not aware I had iron out the bugs.  That part is the
       easiest to do compared with the genius of the program...
       but I still should not have to do it.
This is not "ironing out bugs".  It is configuring the program to run on your version of Unix.  -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
