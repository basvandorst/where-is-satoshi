I could care less if he had an affair, personally. But he had an affair
with a subordinate in his direct employ. When CEO's do that, they get
ostracized. I'm in the military. If I did that, I'd be on the carpet seeing
the Ol' Man, perhaps even court martial, and then out of the military. And
this is the example set by my Commander in Chief???
Many other presidents have had affairs while in office, starting with G.
Washington himself. The difference is, they exercised better judgement and
discretion re: who the affair was with, when and where it was consumated.
Certainly the CIC is projecting a bad image, certainly it is his business
if he has an affair, but when he does it in such a manner that it becomes
front page material in every newspaper around the world, there is something
terribly, desperately wrong.
In case you hadn't noticed, the investigation of him, vis-a-vis the rules
established by other demicans, his supposed compatriates, is still ongoing. Methinks this is just the tip of the iceberg, a bone for the populace to
chew on so that when the rest of the story breaks, we (the dog) won't

Clinton just suffered an "Aw Shit!", he's lost his turn to play, he needs
to get his shit together and get out of the game. I trust you've also seen
the quote attributed to Clinton, on Nixon? Nixon must be turning over in
his grave, even if it isn't Clintons Quote.
I do not consider 'the presidency' to be a 'man'. I see it as an
institution, a figurehead, a place of honor. The President is a man who,
for four years, (or eight) places his own life in standby, for the greater
good of the nation. What good was served by all the affairs Clinton may
have and did have? What good was served by the apparent use of positional
authority to suppress evidence? What good would be served by allowing a
person with the quality set Clinton has demonstrated to remain in THAT Office?
It, more than many other things in american society, function on
'appearances'. That appearance is now tarnished. The sitting president has
lowered himself, and that office, irreparably. He, we and it are laughing
stocks around the world right now. Did you know that the sitting president
in the philippines used Clintons sex scandals in his own election campaign?
Something to do with Clinton getting all the sex scandals, him getting all

Status Of Forces Agreements around the world. Think the Chinese won't look
to use it in the ongoing human rights negotiations?
Yeah, I'm young enough to still feel patriotic, but old enough that I make
my own definition of that term, instead of blindly accepting someone elses.
I don't think a change is in order because I heard some horses ass for an
alphabet news agency say so, I think a change is in order because I
personally can't stand hypocrites, among other things. Especially
hypocrites who commit felonies, say "sorry" and I am expected to forgive,
and stand idly by while he gets away with it. As I've said before, I
personally could care less if he has an affair. But he had one with a
subordinate in his direct employ, then lied about it, repeatedly, even
while under oath in a court of law. He tried to use his positional
authority to suppress evidence, to intimidate, to get the case(s) dismissed. Yeah, I'm REAL PROUD(tm) of my Commander In Chief, he and
CSapronett will both have a lot to talk about. Or was that you?
Perhaps you are one of the Klintonistas, with your "what is the big deal"
attitude, deliberately obfuscating the issue, sidelining the real topics
with irrelevant byline chatter. If that was me, I'd be doing jail time. If this is allowed to stand, it
will represent the opening salvo, and mark the beginning of the End of
America as a Great Nation(tm).
Yeah, I can imagine a time when crypto and anonymous accounts don't exist

account that can be replied to, when you send your "I'm better than you,
'cuz I've been on the list longer' drivel. Perhaps you have, but it doesn't
change anything.
I am still outspoken,
you are still loath to reveal your identity, even when discussing something
as innocuous as this. Spineless is the term normally used.

Jim Brown mentioned the use of soccer hooligans to justify the widespread

and how use of large sunglasses, hats, scarves, false mustaches or beards
might complicate that identification. I would further add that, if knowing
such implements were in use, or upon seeing such devices, some persons
might be inclined to keep their face turned down, or away, to further
complicate identification by such a system.
This is what gets me.
Is a government training its populace to walk about with face directed at
the ground 5 feet in front of? To be afraid of holding the head upright? To
dissuade noticing the guards patrolling the fence, to ignore the overt
threat and implication this implies?
Are we (they) really training a generation to fear authority, to cow to,
and bow down to it without a fight? We are stationing some people in your house, to keep an eye on the

It is a Christian belief that life and immortality were brought to light,
and death, the last enemy, was destroyed by a personal Jesus only 2,000
years ago. The very same revelation had been accredited to Horus (a major
egyptian god), the anointed, at least 3,000 years before. Horus, as the
impersonal and ideal revealer, was the Messiah in the astronomical
mythology and the Son of God in the eschatology. The doctrine of
immortality is so ancient in Egypt that the "Book of Vivifying the Soul
Forever" was not only extant in the time of the First Dynasty but was then
so old that the true tradition of interpretation was at that time already
The Egyptian Horus, as revealer of immortality, was the ideal figure of the
ancient spritualists that the soul of man, or the Manes, persisted beyond
death and the dissolution of the present body.
The Origin and Evolution
We find, depicted on stones in many countries where the Stellar Cult people
migrated, remains of the old Astronomical religion which proves their
perfect knowledge of the revolutions of the Starry Vast and the Laws
governing these revolutions, all of which they imaged iconographically or
by Signs and Symbols. And where they have not built Pyramids they have
recorded the truth in the so-called "Cups and Rings" and "curious carvings"
found on boulders, cist-covers, on living rock, and on standing stones
throughout the British Isles, Europe, Asia, Africa, and other parts of the
world - which hitherto have been deemed to involve insoluble problems and
have been to all our learned professors an outstanding puzzle in
pre-historic research. But they are easily read, and the secrets are
unfolded in the Sign Language of the Astronomical, or Stellar Cult Religion
of the Ancient Egyptians.
The mutilation of Osiris in his coffin, the stripping of his corpse and
tearing it asunder by Set, who scattered it piecemeal, has its equivalent
by the stripping of the dead body of Jesus whilst it still hung upon the
Cross, and parting the garments amongst the spoilers. In St. John's account the crucifixion takes place at the time of the
Passover, and the victim of sacrifice in human form is substituted for, and
identified with, the Paschal Lamb. But, as this version further shows, the
death assigned is in keeping with that of the non-human victim. Not a bone
of the sufferer to be broken. This is supposed to be in fulfilment of
prophecy. It is said by the Psalmist (34:20): "He keepeth all His bones;
not one of them is broken". But this was in strict accordance with the
original law of Tabu. No matter what the type, from bear to lamb, no bone
of the sacrificial victim was ever permitted to be broken; and the only
change was in the substitution of the human type for the animal, which had
been made already when human Horus became the type of sacrifice instead of
the calf or lamb. When the Australian natives sacrificed their little bear,
not a bone of it was ever broken. When the Iroquois sacrificed the white
dog, not a bone was broken. This was a common custom, on account of the
resurrection as conceived by the primitive races, and the same is applied
to Osiris-Horus. Every bone of the skeleton was to remain intact as a basis
for the future building.
It is an utterance of the Truth that is eternal to say that Horus as the
Son of God had previously been all the Gospel Jesus is made to say his is,
or is to become:
Horus and the Father are one;
*Jesus says, "I and my Father are one". He that seeth Me, seeth Him that
sent me".
*Horus is the Father seen in the Son.
*Jesus claims to be the Son in whom the Father is revealed.
*Horus was the light of the world, the light that is represented by the
symbolical eye, the sign of salvation.
*Jesus is made to declare that He is the light of the world.
*Horus was the way, the truth, the life by name and in person.
*Jesus is made to assert that he is the way, the truth, and the life.
*Horus was the plant, the shoot, the natzar.
*Jesus is made to say: "I am the true vine".
*Horus says: "It is I who traverse the heaven; I go around the Sekhet-Arru
(the Elysian Fields); Eternity has been assigned to me without end. Lo! I
am heir of endless time and my attribute is eternity".
*Jesus says: "I am come down from Heaven. For this is the will of the
Father that everyone who beholdeth the Son and believeth in Him should have
eternal life, and I willl raise him up at the last day"
He, too, claims to be the lord of eternity.
*Horus says: "I open the Tuat that I may drive away the darkness"
*Jesus says: "I am come a light unto the world."
*Horus says: (I am equipped with thy words O Ra (the father in
heaven)(ch.32) and repeat them to those who are deprived of breath.
(ch.38). These were the words of the father in heaven.
*Jesus says: "The Father which sent me, he hath given me a commandment,
what I should say and what I should speak. Whatsoever I speak, therefore,
even as the Father said unto me, so I speak the word which ye hear is not
mine, but the Father's which sent me".
   A comparative list of some pre-existing types to Christianity shows
further how these types were brought on in the canonical Gospels and the
Book of Revelation:
*Horus baptized with water by Anup = Jesus baptized with water by John.
*Aan, a name of the divine scribe = John the divine scribe.
*Horus born in Annu, the place of bread = Jesus born in Bethlehem, the
house of bread
*Horus the Good Shepherd with the crook upon his shoulders = Jesus the Good
Shepherd with the lamb or kid upon his shoulder
*The Seven on board the boat with Horus = The seven fishers on board the
boat with Jesus
*Horus as the Lamb = Jesus as the Lamb.
*Horus as the Lion = Jesus as the Lion
*Horus identified with the Tat or Cross = Jesus identified with the Cross
*Horus of twelve years = Jusus of twelve years
*Horus made a man of thirty years in his baptism = Jesus made a man of
thirty years in his baptism
*Horus the Krst = Jesus the Christ
*Horus the manifesting Son of God = Jesus the manifesting Son of God
* The trinity of Atum the Father, Horus the Son, and Ra the Holy Spirit =
The trinity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
*The first Horus as child of the Virgin, the second as Son of Ra = Jesus as
the Virgin's child, the Christ as Son of the Father.
*Horus the sower and Set the destroyer in the harvestfield = Jesus the
sower of the good seed and Satan the sower of tares.
*Horus carried of by Set to the summit of Mount Hetep = Jesus spirited away
by Satan into an exceedingly high mountain
*Set and Horus contending on the Mount = Jesus and Satan contending on the
*Horus as Iu-em-Hetep, the child teacher in the temple = The child Jesus as
teacher in the Temple
* The mummy bandage that was woven without seam = The vesture of the Christ
without a seam.
*Twelve followers of Horus as Har-Khutti = Twelve followers of Jesus as the
twelve disciples.

Let's try this again.
Notice how, in each of the amendments below, the 1st is the only one with
the text "congress shall make no law".
This is implied, understood to be implied, accepted as implied and supreme
court ruled to be implied as applicable to each of the rest of the bill of
rights, and later to the amendments, wherein it is not so specified as in
the 1st.
A large part of the reason that 2 thru 10 and the rest do not include that
phrase is to prevent the states from doing the very thing that congress was
and is prohibited from.
Congress cannot pass any law that would infringe freedom of speech, they
cannot cause the states by threat or incentive to pass such laws either-
say by withholding highway maintenance funding a la 55.
Arbitrary out of context interpretations of documents such as this are just
that. I grant you no brownie points for comprehension, you may have earned
some demerits for instigating a straw man.

Perfectly acceptable to me personally.

Or how it will result in turning the public opinion, iraqi and/or american, touted by the biased US press in such a fashion that it would result in a munificent display of openness, agreeablility, and welcoming to the UN inspectors by the iraqi hosts. Or show how Hussein is now trustworthy, and thereby qualified by the MIB office of the USG to possess said weapons.

Ostensibly, the reason for bombing Iraq is to remove their ability to engage in hostilities. We all know how that is supposed to work
I'm not so sure- we did not engage in hostilities against Iraq until AFTER they invaded Kuwait. We did cease and desist when requested by other middle east sovereignties who were members of the UN coalition. You shouldn't base your life lessons on what appears on the boob tube. I'll be the first to agree the US media is wholly engaged in propaganda, that Hollywood uses films to convey political messages. Their success is dependant on a couple of factors, among them being whether the viewer is a person capable of rational thought, or a sheeple.

Do you view our bombing Iraq as sanction? Or as retaliation for their
sanction of Kuwait? Later, is our bombing of Iraq sanction, or follow
through on our warning in light of Husseins continued thwarting of UN
inspectors? I don't think Iraq measures up as an example of a sovereign nation the US
sactioned. You would have been better off listing the anti-terrorist
strikes in the Sudan and Afghanistan, but even those were not "sanctions"
in the same sense that Iraq-Kuwait were.
Lead the horse to water, and make him drink? The evidence is there to be
seen, one need only be willing to see. Yes, that knife cuts both ways.
Boils down to ideological differences. I believe in defense through a strong offense (threat of retaliation) and
carrying out that retaliation when provoked. I do not see eye to eye with
everything the UN does, that does not mean I'm willing to allow one
expansionist dictator to sanction another country and gain control of
enough of the worlds oil supply to impact the well-being of my country. Nor
does it mean we (the US) should become totally isolationist. With the hue
and cry from the world community, I believe our/the UN retaliation against
Iraqs sanction of Kuwait is, and always will be justifiable.
I view Somalia and the Bosnia fiascos differently, they are internal
conflicts. In Bosnia, there is the added factor of "ethnic cleansing". I'm reminded of the truisms about how a drowning man will accept help from
any source, and that a wild animal will bite the hand that feeds it. I'm
personally leary of any involvement with those internal conflicts because
it is interfering with that 'survival of the fittest' thing. DH Key available upon request.
