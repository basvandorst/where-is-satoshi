@_subject: San Diego CPunks Symposium 
San Diego Area CPUNKS symposium  Thursday, February 29 (we're lucky this was
a leap year...) 1996
   Invitation to all Cypherpunks to join the San Diego crowd at "The Mission
Cafe & Coffee Shop" were we will get updates on Lance's new ISP, perhaps the
new Win32 mixmaster client, and other new goodies. As a special *BONUS* we
can also exchange keys, and discuss other topical subjects.
   Don't forget to bring your public key fingerprint (and two forms of ID).
If you can figure out how to get a PGP fingerprint on the back of a business
card, that would be cool.  Place: The Mission Cafe & Coffee Shop
       3795 Mission Blvd. in Mission Beach.
       488-9060
Their Directions:
        (their description, not mine)
They serve stuff to eat, coffee stuff, and beer.
See you there!
New people, don't forget your fingerprint.
Drop me a note if you plan to attend.
   Adam, Esq.
