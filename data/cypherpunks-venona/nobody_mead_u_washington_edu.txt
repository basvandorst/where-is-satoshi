Hey guys, I think someone has been listening:
                                 Network World
                                 April  26, 1993
NSA has public-key chip to complement  Clipper Chip;
Uses same controversial key escrow system.
By Ellen Messmer, Senior Correspondent
WASHINGTON, D.C.
   The algorithm developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) for use with
the government's newly proposed  Clipper Chip  private-key encryption system
will also show up in Capstone, a chip for public-key encryption, Network World
has learned.
   Like  Clipper Chip,  Capstone will use a key escrow system that will enable
the government to eavesdrop on encrypted information.  Vendors of Capstone-based
encryption products will have to register decryption keys with a federal agency
that other agencies can retrieve through legal means.
   Although Capstone has not been publicly announced, it is at the heart of the
encryption system that is to be used in the upcoming Defense Message System
(DMS) (see story, p.1).
   With the public-key Capstone system, one key is made public, while another is
kept secret; the message recipient and sender do not have to exchange keys as
they do in private-key systems such as the Data Encryption Standard and
 Clipper Chip.   With Capstone, key management is much simpler.
    Clipper Chip,  for example, enables users to encrypt electronic documents
before sending them to the intended recipient, but the recipient must have
received the sender's secret key beforehand in order to decrypt the document.
   In addition, Capstone will provide the electronic digital signature for
"signing" documents electronically, something private-key systems cannot do.
   Mykotronx, Inc., the Torrance, Calif., firm that designed  Clipper Chip,  is
also supplying the Capstone chipset.  John Droge, vice president of marketing at
Mykotronx, an authorized NSA Communications Security vendor, said the firm has
already shipped 10,000 Capstone and 20,000  Clipper Chip  chipsets.
   The NSA intends to equip military users of the DMS with cryptocards -- dubbed
Tessera cards -- containing the Capstone chips so users can enter and activate
the public-key encryption and signing features. The Tessera cards are based on
the new industry standard PCMCIA, named after the Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association, which created the standard. Mykotronx is currently
the sole Tessera card supplier.
   Last week, the NSA acknowledged that the private-key algorithm to be used
with Capstone in the DMS is the same as that used in  Clipper Chip.  "The [DMS]
Type 2 algorithm is the same as the  Clipper Chip  announced by the Clinton
administration," said John Nagengast, chief of strategic systems at the NSA,
speaking last week at the Information Systems Security Association's trade show
CardTech/SecureTech in Arlington, Va. "It will enable us to go across the
government with a common algorithm."
User reaction
   The key escrow concept behind both  Clipper Chip  and Capstone have left many
users and vendors worried.
   Sandra Lambert, vice president of information security at Citibank, N.A., and
Samuel Epstein, president of Racal-Guardata, Inc., said the key escrow system
raises the issue of security vulnerability, which could result from a break-in
at the site where the escrow keys will be stored.
   The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a public advocacy group based here,
has taken the position that the public should not have to rely on the government
as the sole source for encryption chips.  Last week, the EFF began pulling
together a coalition of vendors and users under the banner of its Digital
Privacy and Security Working Group to address the issues raised by  Clipper
 Chip.   AT&T, which announced that it would include  Clipper Chip  in its
Secure Telephone Device, will participate in the EFF forum.
   Government sources last week said AT&T rushed out with its  Clipper Chip
announcement because the Department of Justice wants to purchase AT&T telephone
security devices with  Clipper Chip.  Last week, AT&T said it based its decision
to include the  Clipper Chip  chipset on faith rather than knowledge. "We've
told the government there's a need to establish the credibility of the
standard," said Mike Agee, marketing manager for secure products at AT&T.
   Although publication of the  Clipper Chip  specification would not compromise
the effectiveness of the algorithm, the NSA said it intends to keep the
algorithm secret. "The plan is we would share it with academia on a limited
basis," Nagengast said. "I don't believe it's ever intended to be published."

This is a remailer test. Please forgive the waste of time/space.

Q2: What help is available?
Check out the pub/cypherpunks directory at soda.berkeley.edu
(128.32.149.19).  Instructions on how to use the remailers are in the
remailer directory, along with some unix scripts and dos batch files.
The public keys for the remailers which support encrypted remailing
requests is also available in the same directory.
Mail to me (elee9sf for further help and/or questions.

@_author: emacs has lots of functions! 
@_subject: ANON: nntp, apology 
I feel silly.  It just occurred to me that the remailers operate by
piping to sendmail directly; thus a lone period is interpreted as "the
end".  So I have cunningly arranged for my message to be indented by
one space (emacs has lots of functions!).
I apologize for posting this essentially three times.  I'm sure by now
nobody cares how to forge a usenet post :-)
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
 So, we can all forge mail with smtp, use the cypherpunk remailers, use
 "anonymous" servers like penet and charcoal, email-to-usenet gateways,
 etc.  I've never seen instructions on how to forge a usenet post, so
 here goes:
 1) Telnet to an NNTP server (see Yanoff's internet services list)
 2) Type 'post'.  After a bit, you'll get an OK message.
 3) Type in what you want to appear.  Have in mind before you start
    what fields you want in the header, or check other posts to see what
    they have.
 4) End with a period on a line all by itself.  After a bit, you'll get
    a "Post OK" message.
 5) Type 'quit'
 For example, I was experimenting and telnetted to news.fu-berlin.de 119:
 ======================================================================
 menudo> telnet news.fu-berlin.de 119
 Trying 130.133.4.250...
 Connected to gibb.math.fu-berlin.de.
 Escape character is '^]'.

 Although Path: contains the one!two!three I typed at the end, it
 reveals math.fu-berlin.de as the origin of the post.  Also, the
 Message-ID field reveals math.fu-berlin.de.  More works needs to be
 done on how to suppress or further disguise these fields, if possible.

This is the cypherpunks list, not the extropians list. The article was about cypherpunks, not extropians, so it's irrelevent whether the extrops are luddites.
As for the c-punks, there's nothing inherently non-luddite about us. Not all of us accept all uses of computers and technology without question. There are certain machines that need to be trashed. I
liked the reference in the article. I don't think it was 100% accurate, but you should be aware that there ARE cypherpunks Luddites lurking out here...
