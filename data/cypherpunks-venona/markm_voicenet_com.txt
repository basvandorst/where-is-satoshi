This is correct.  I believe there are some UNIX flavors under which U.S. PGP
can generate 2048 bit keys.  However, most only allow 2047 bit keys.  The
international version does not have this bug.
I really don't see the point of using a key larger than 2048 bits.  Any larger
key would actually be harder to factor than brute forcing the IDEA keyspace.
Very little security would be gained from using a key larger than 3000 bits.
Of course, one can always argue that improved factoring methods would require
that an RSA public key be longer than 3000 bits to have equal security to
IDEA.  However, I doubt that factoring methods will improve that much.  A
2048 bit key should be more than enough security for most applications.

There is no reason for anyone to know that these two nyms are used by the same

@_subject: digital signatures and "meaning" 
Digital signatures can have many different uses and meanings.  The most
popular application of digital signatures is proof of authorship.  A
person signs something when he claims that he wrote it and if the signature
is invalid, the message must have been altered.
However, digital signatures are used for many other applications.  Typical
applications include timestamping, digital cash, and validating a document
or statement.  The problem with these applications is that there must be some
way to distinguish and timestamp signature from a proof of authorship.  There
are several different ways to do this:
                  - Make all digital signatures prove proof of authorship.
                    Someone would include the text of the document he
                    wants to sign and put a message saying at the end such
                    as: "This document existed on such and such date" or,
                    in the case of digital cash, "This coin was blinded and
                    signed by the bank using standard protocols."
                  - Append some kind of electronic tag to the message that
                    represents a certain kind of authorization.  This is
                    identical to the previous method except it relies more
                    on protocols.
                  - Specify the type of signing that is to be done with a
                    key.  This could be included in the text of the user-ID
                    field of the public key in a PGP-like program.  It could
                    also be done by extending a key generation and management
                    protocol to include a tag on the key itself specifying
                    what this key is to be used for.
There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these.  The first has the
advantage that it requires no protocol modification but relies on "legaleese."
The second method does require that protocols be slightly modified, but these
modifications could be made by just pre-processing and post-processing the
message with another program.  However, this is more limited than the first
method because it essentially uses "canned" messages.  The final method relies
on either no modification to the crypto program used or a non-trivial
Personally, I tend to think that anything that uses a standardized protocol
is a Good Thing.  This is why I think that the second and third methods
listed above would work better than the first.

I'm a little rusty on physics, but it seems to me that you are forgetting the
fact that energy needs to be used in order to lower the temperature below the
temperature of background radiation.  A lot of energy.  I don't have any
numbers available, but I think that it would takes much more energy to invert
a bit where energy has to be used to keep the temperature below the temperature
of background radiation then to invert the bit at temperatures greater than or
equal to the temperature of background radiation.  Brute-force cracking will
take less energy when the universe has cooled off more (assuming it does
implode first).

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Reply-To: Jim Thompson Sent From: jim (Jim Thompson)
Algorithm Inc.
Ever get the feeling that your computer is watching you?  Mine has been
keeping an eye on me and I don't much like it.   I've been trying out a
clever, creepy piece of software called WatchDog that  tracks every
move I make on my office or home computer.  Despite its name, Internet
Watchdog doesn't track just on-line activity; it keeps a log of every
program running.
The program was created by Algorithm Inc. in Atlanta, and is being
marketed by Charles River Media in Rockland.  I've run Internet
WatchDog on my home machine for about a week now, and I have only one
problem with the product --  it works.  It's a superb piece of software
that makes my skin crawl.
Blame it one experience.  Years ago, I worked at the US Postal Service
on an electronic mail sorting machine.  In those days, Postal Service
managers assumed that all workers were lazy and dishonest.  We were
constantly watched  through video cameras and two-way mirrors to make
sure we weren't stealing anything.  And computers monitored us at the
sorting consoles to make sure we put forth our maximum effort.
Programs like Internet WatchDog could bring some of that flavor of
paranoia to business offices all over America.  But David Pallai,
president of Charles River Media, says that's not what he has in mind.
Pallai's goal was a less intrusive, more efficient way to monitor the
"We did not believe in censorship or blocking, " Pallai said.  Internet
blockers like SurfWatch or Cyber Patrol rely on lists of naughty 'Net
sites drawn up by a sort of Legion of Decency.  It's a job Pallai
didn't want.  Besides, so many new sites open every day that these
blocking programs must be constantly updated, and customers must pay
for the privilege.   "We decided that what we need is something that
monitors, as a telephone bill monitors calls, instead of blocking a
program," Pallai said.
Internet WatchDog is available in Windows or Macintosh formats.  It
starts whenever you turn on the computer.  You can switch it off, but
the program will tell your boss if you do.  The boss gets a password
that lets him or her read the information that Internet WatchDog has
filed away.
Internet WatchDog stores a log of every important computer event.  It
remembers when you turned the machine on, the name of every piece of
software you've used and when you used it.  Start up your Internet
dialer or a copy of Doom, and it's there.
Do you occasionally download photos from the Internet?  Don't save them
on your hard drive.  Internet WatchDog searches the drive and lists
every file in the GIF and JPEG formats, the most popular way to
distribute pictures on the net.  So keeping files with names like
NEKKID.GIF isn't a smart idea.
The slickest, spookiest part of Internet WatchDog is its automatic
screen capture.  The software keeps count of the changes in pixels -
the thousands of  tiny glowing dots on your computer screen.  If enough
of the pixels change, the program knows that some new image has flashed
up on your screen.
When that happens, it takes a screen snapshot, marks it with the date
and time, and files it away.  Even if you don't change screens, a
snapshot will be taken every 15 minutes.  Then the boss can see the
same images you've been looking at all day.
The program will save up to 10 megabytes of data - more if the boss
asks for it.  You can go back in time and see exactly what an employer
(sic - TT] was doing on his computer on 2:15 last Wednesday.
Internet WatchDog has only been on sale for a few weeks, but already,
Pallai has gotten lots of feedback.  "When I hear from the CEOs, they
love it," he said.  "When I hear from employees, they hate it."  I'll
Of course, employers aren't the only ones who can use Internet
WatchDog.  Pallai is also selling his products to parents and school
systems who want to monitor children's use of computers.  Indeed,
Pallai estimates that about 60 percent of his customers so far have
been parents and school systems.
Snooping on the kids is fine with me.  Children were made to be
monitored.  It's using this stuff on grown-ups that I don't care for.
Even Pallai isn't entirely thrilled.  To make Internet WatchDog a
little less intrusive, he tweaked some features.  For instance, the
program doesn't spy on you in secret.  It announces its presence when
it starts up.  Pallai decided not to include a feature that would
identify every Internet site you visit.  And there's no versions for
networks yet - Pallai's not sure he wants a network administrator to
look in on every worker's computer anytime he likes.  "We were trying
not to make it too Big Brotherish," he said.
But other firms are selling snoop software designed for network use.
Much of it was developed to ensure that workers aren't using pirated
programs on the job, but it can also be used to analyze every move you
make on your computer.  And the rise of the Internet has given
companies a big new reason to track corporate computer use.
After all, it's the company's machine and the company's time.  Your
boss has every right to keep an eye on you.  Still, it adds an
unwelcome hint of paranoia in a world that already has enough to go
around.  Soon, we may all be staring at our computers, wondering
whether they're staring back.

@_subject: Re: An idea for refining penet-style anonymous servers 
Funny.  I had the *exact* same idea a couple of months ago.  However, I
did find several flaws in it.
Perhaps the address could be hashed several times for the table look-up and
then the address could be hashed a less number of times for decryption with
the IDEA key.  This reduces the amount of code needed and also eliminates
any problems with only using 128 bits of SHA output.
In the scheme I thought of, a password would be sent with the message, which
would be hashed, appended to the hash of the address, and then hashed again
to get the decryption key.
Searching for the real address behind a pseudonym is not hard at all.  Just
hash the anonymous address, look it up in the table, then decrypt the
cooresponding encrypted address.  This was the major flaw that I spotted with
this scheme.
The only other problem I found is a pretty minor one: the address database
would be twice as large as it would be if it was stored in plaintext.  I
don't think that much security is gained by using this scheme.

I was thinking about how Mixmaster needs a separate message format so it
can make messages a fixed size and add a packet ID.  However, couldn't all
this be done with PGP?  With PGP, the length of the file being encrypted is
encrypted itself, so it would be possible to append random data to the end
of the file to make the message a fixed length like Mixmaster.  Also, the
packet-ID could be implemented by putting a line such as the following in the
Packet-ID: foobar
The only other thing that would have to be taken care of is chaining.  The
way I could see this working is to have a header in the encrypted message that
tells the remailer whether it should de-armor the message at the next layer,
append random data, then re-armor, and pass it to the next remailer.  Am I
missing something?

is some way to chain proxies and encrypt to each individual proxy.  If the
operator of a proxy is more trustworthy than the operators of any sites you

it is directly passed to inews for posting.  In this case, the headers could
be scanned for any binary newsgroups.  If mail2news software is being used
which creates a mailing alias for each newsgroup, then the e-mail addresses
of all the binary newsgroups could be placed on the block list.  Unfortunately,
you do need root access to set up such an alias.
If you don't have root access, then grepping the newsgroups header for binary
newsgroups before piping the message to inews is probably the best way.

a 512 bit number is easier than bruting a 64-bit key space, it is not feasible

The point isn't whether MD5 can be attacked in a "real life" application, but
that there is a flaw in MD5.  This means that it is weaker than an algorithm
like SHA that has no known cryptanalytical attacks against it.  Besides, a
hashing algorithm with a 128-bit output can be broken as easily as a 64-bit
encryption key.  MD5 shouldn't be used for that reason alone.

This is one reason.  I think that there are several other reasons:
 -- Someone may be using a machine at work or on a multiuser UNIX system which
    is untrusted and insecure.  In the case of a UNIX account, one could
    compose a message off-line and rz it using a term program, but that is a
    major hassle.
 -- Many email programs do not have support for PGP so signing a message often
    requires a lot of cutting and pasting.
 -- PGP may not work on the computer a person is using for Internet access or
    the system might be too slow to use PGP.
I think they are both equally important.  The point of public-key cryptography
is the ability to communicate with a person without having a secure channel to
exchange keys.  Once keys can be transmitted using the same medium used for the
encrypted traffic, it makes a MITM or denial-of-service attack much easier.
There has to be some out-of-band method to authenticate keys.  Without
authentication, a lot of the security that could be gained by using PK crypto
is lost.

That still doesn't mean it isn't a disorder.  People with ADD _want_ to get

just this.  Dyslexia is also something that is a normal variation.  Somehow,
since it isn't psychologically related, no one would object if a drug was
discovered that could cure it and was administered to children with dyslexia.
Many people with ADD do not want to act the way they do, so it doesn't make
sense to not treat it as a disorder.
Who decides which mental illnesses or disorder are legitimate?  I think both
school phobia and ADD are disorders that can be treated if the person with
the disorder is willing to be treated.  You are, of course, free to believe
that these disorders are illegitimate, but the millions of people afflicted

As long as we're talking about "key words", the "very small %" is very small
indeed.  In the next paragraph you say "most kids" which is not at all
contradictory to "a very small %".  I may have my facts mixed up, but
Tourette's disease is an illness where one tends to say things that one was
thinking but not meaning.
You are forgetting that this is a _disease_.  That means that someone cannot
be cured of it by discipline or common sense.  It's no different from diabetes
or any other disease.
That wasn't the point.  The point is instead of dopping every kid that doesn't
pay attention in school up with Ritalin, kids should instead be diagnosed as
having ADD before receiving Ritalin treatment.  It can be helpful for the kids
who actually have ADD.
Someone with a disease such as bipolar disorder would disagree with you.  There
are some bipolar people who, without lithium, will end up with large wounds
caused by razor blades on the arms and legs.  Others that use sleeping pills
give them to a trusted third party (see the crypto relevance) who will prevent
them from overdosing.  Some people with ADD need Ritalin to be able to be
successful and function.  You can wax philosophical about how drugs alter a
person's personality making them a zombie, but people voluntarily take drugs
that can help them dramatically.  Some people cannot learn to "deal with life."
OK, now for the real crypto relevance.  Snow seems to be in denial about
psychological illnesses.  This is the "it will never happen to me" attitude.
Such an attitude is very common and is human nature.  However this can be
very dangerous, especially when applied to governments.  People may eventually
believe that it is OK for the government to violate the civil liberties of
those suspected of committing a crime.  After all, law abiding citizens are
never suspects in crimes.  Mandatory key escrow is perfectly all right.  The
only people that will get wiretapped are the people who are criminal types.
And even if a law abiding citizen is wiretapped, it won't matter because that
citizen unit never breaks the law.

Incorrect.  I am not certain if ADD has been definitely linked to a lack of a
certain neurotransmitter, but since it shows up on a PET scan, it probably is.
You say that a disorder defined only by behavioral percentage in not a real
disorder.  If the number was far less than 10%, would you then consider it
a disease.  In an earlier message, you claimed that depression is an actual
disease.  One-third of all Americans have some form of clinical depression.
Your logic escapes me.
First of all, being tall is not really important in today's society.  It used
to be that people who had certain weaknesses and disorders were killed off
according to evolution.  Since we live in a developed society, evolution no
longer has any effect on humans.  It seems that the only people who think that
drug treatment is bad for people with disorders that can cause that person to
not reach his or her potential are those who have never even been afflicted
with a mental disorder.  Nor do they know much about the subject.
People have lost jobs because of ADD.  Everyone has to do something undesirable
at one point or another.  For an ADD person, stopping a task that is very
interesting to that person to do boring work can be very difficult.  Rather
than blaming the public schools, it is much more productive to find a way to
work around such a barrier.  Ritalin is often the best way to do that.
I guess I am a True Believer.  I believe that ADD exists.  I also believe in
the theory of Relativity.  Both of these are backed by hard evidence and nearly
unanimous agreement among specialists in these fields.  There is a middle
ground between believing that every kid who is hyperactive or has a short
attention span should be on Ritalin, and saying that ADD doesn't exist and it
is just a simple misfortune.  Of course, it's rather easy to dismiss something
as a misfortune which doesn't effect you personally.

@_subject: Steganography 
There has been some discussion on steganography in the past few days.  I've
been thinking about the subject so here is a list of my random thoughts:
1. Steganography "standard": Current steganography software relies almost
totally on security through obscurity.  The problem with such an approach is
that there is no standard way to extract data from .gif or .jpg files.  If
two people want to communicate using stego, they have to have some secure
channel through which they could negotiate a protocol that could extract
information from data files.  This brings up the same Catch-22 situation that
exists with conventional cryptography.
My idea is that there should be some common, well-known way to de-stego data
files.  This really doesn't weaken the security of any stego software because
if strong crypto that doesn't append any headers on to the message is used in
conjunction with stego software, then the output of a stego program would just
appear to be random garbage.  There would be no way for the feds to prove that
the random data was encrypted.  I don't know much about graphic and sound file
formats, but I think that in most cases the least-significant bit of a graphics
or sound file should be pretty random anyway.
2. Recognizing stegoed data: Another problem with stegonography is that while
many programs use some kind of identifying header so the recipient can tell
whether the file contains hidden information or not, this also allows a snooper
to determine the same thing.  I think that the ability for the recipient to
identify whether the data is stegoed or not is important.  So I came up with
the idea of using a MAC keyed with the session key used to encrypt the hidden
data for checking if the picture contains stegoed data.  With this approach,
an attacker would not be able to verify if a file contained hidden data or not
since the session key would be encrypted with the recipient's public key.
3. Message pools: With steganography more widespread, the use of message pools
becomes a lot more interesting.  People could communicate anonymously using one
of the alt.binaries.* groups with everyone else reading the group completely
oblivious to this fact.  The posts would be pictures that would decode
normally, but only the recipient would be able to decrypt the hidden data.
Since the binaries newsgroups are among the most popular on the Usenet, reading
one of the binaries newsgroups would draw less suspicion then reading
alt.anonymous.messages.  I don't know how reliable some of the binaries groups
are since many NNTP servers don't carry them or expire the articles early, but
since cross-posting seems to be fairly common on those newsgroups anyway, a
cross-posted file with stegoed data would have a good chance of reaching the

I don't entirely agree with this.  I think both groups want information to be
free, but also want people to be able to have privacy.  Most hackers (used in
the sense of people who break into computers) attack computers owned by such
companies as TRW and the phone companies.  Both of these systems have little
regard for privacy.  Most non-malicious hackers promote system security, but
at the same time, don't like government-controlled monopolies and agencies to
be able to keep secret information that should be free.  A very interesting
paper by Dorothy Denning (she used to be regarded very highly by the hacker
community before she started to support Clipper) expresses some of the
concerns and morals of hackers.  It's called "Concerning Hackers Who Break Into
Computer Systems" and is in Phrack issue 32.
That's debatable.  I think many people incorrectly consider these terms to be
mutually exclusive.  There are many hackers (used in the sense defined in the
Jargon File) who also break into systems and could therefore be considered
crackers also.  Most hackers definitely have the knowledge to break into
computer systems, but many crackers aren't very well versed in programming and
learn how to break into computers by using canned programs and G-files.

POTP is a stream cipher where the key is derived from a "state" and bits from
the ciphertext chosen using the current state.  Two machines have to
synchronize their states before encryption can take place.  The key is derived
from a one-way function performed on the state.  This really doesn't solve the
key distribution problem because initial synchronization has to take place on
a secure channel.  The current state also has to be saved on each machine.
I think the "escrow" system you are referring to is some other encryption
Elementrix does acknowledge that they have a stream cipher and don't refer to
it as a one-time pad.  The only reason OTP is in the name is that the key
derived from the state is as long as the ciphertext being encrypted.  They
claim that the state is larger than the key and it is computationally
infeasible to derive the state given the key.  I would guess that the size of
the next state is determined by the size of the plaintext to be encrypted.
As for security of the system, I really don't know.  Their algorithm is
proprietary so I would avoid it for that reason alone.  They have not yet
gotten any comments regarding security from any cryptographers.  The entire
security of this system is based upon the algorithm used to generate the state
from a previous state and the one-way function used to generate the session
key.  Unless they are using a hash algorithm like SHA-1 to generate the keys
and states, I would seriously question the security of it.

to avoid several nasty attacks that are successful if plain RSA is used.
It is generally not a good idea to sign an encrypted message.  The signature
should be calculated on the plaintext, not ciphertext.
This has the same problem as SSLeay is pretty fast and does have code to use PKCS.  It probably doesn't make
that much of a difference.  RSAref isn't necessary; RSA isn't patented outside
the USA.  The other packages are faster and better than RSAref.

@_subject: Blocking addresses by default 
With remailer abuse becoming more popular and remailers going down because of
complaints, there seems to be some interest in remailer software that will
block all email by default and will only pass along email that is explicitly
unblocked.  This way, someone won't receive harassing anonymous email unless
they ask to receive anonymous email.  This would also allow remailers to only
pass along mail that is destined for another remailer.  Looking at the source
code for the various remailers, this doesn't seem to be too difficult.
In the Freedom and Mixmaster remailer programs, there is a function which
determines whether an address is in the block list or not.  Both of these
functions use strstr() to search for the address in each line of the block
list.  In both programs, the strstr() call is within an if statement, so
changing the strstr() to !strstr() should invert the return value for the
blocking function.  I haven't tried this out yet, so there may be some problem
I overlooked.
The Ghio Type I program doesn't require any modification at all.  If my
understanding of the way the dest.block file is processed is correct, a file
such as the following should do the trick:

All the addresses following the "!" are addresses that anonymous mail can be
delivered to.

How would this be possible?  The latest GAK proposal is for companies to store
keys instead of the government.  There is the potential for colaboration
between a TLA and an "escrow" company.  It is also possible for a TLA to
illegally obtain the keys from the company's database.  However, it would
still be impossible to review every message.  Even if the government had full
access to all encryption keys, it would still be technically infeasible to
review every message.
Good stego is possible.  Stegoing data in jpegs is very secure and probably
infeasible to detect.  This scenario is not entirely unrealistic -- in some
states a rise in electrical bills is enough to get a judge to issue a search
warrant to search the suspect's home for evidence of marijuana cultivation.
However, I find the life sentence idea pretty unrealistic.  You are assuming
that there will be wide support for tough restrictions on crypto.  This is
not currently the case and I doubt it would ever get to this point.
Not very many people are currently supporting any life sentence for anyone
who is in possession of explosives, despite the increase in terrorist
activity.  Gun-control advocates aren't supporting laws that will give a life
sentence to anyone who owns a gun.  Given that many people who believe in

True.  I wasn't proposing any centralized list or a complete alternative to
the current way remailers are set up.  Just an alternative for some people who

could just be the addresses of other remailers.  Others could be set up to
only deliver mail to other remailers, mailing lists, and newsgroups.
If every remailer adopted this system, then this would be true.
This is a good idea.  I also like the idea of remailers forwarding some sort
of notification to a first-time recipient where the recipient actually has to
request that the mail be delivered.  However, the storage requirement might be
a little impractical for some remailers.  If the disclaimers are really
annoying, it would be easy enough to remove these disclaimers with a simple
procmail recipe or some equivalent.
The "cutmarks" option would allow backwards compatability.  Alternatively, the
remailer might be able to determine whether the next hop is a "real" email
address or another remailer.  I believe this would be pretty easy with
Mixmaster since a remailer can tell if it is the final hop or not.

I think this problem can be solved by blind signing the tokens.  A user
generates a random number, multiplies it by the blinding factor, then sending
it to a token server which would append a timestamp and sign the blinded
token.  All signature requests should be signed with a PGP key.  The server
response would be encrypted with the user's public key.  A person's PGP key
would be sent along with the subscription request and then saved by the list
The token would be included in a user's list submission, removed, and saved by
the list software to detect any duplicates.  The server would issue a limited
number of tokens to each public key registered with it.  If two signed requests
come from the same email address in the same day signed with different keys,
only the tokens in the first request should be signed.
The only problem with this scheme is the inconvenience of having to register
a public key with the server before posting.  Someone with many different email
addresses could generate a public key for each address to get more tokens.  The
only way to prevent this is to control list subscriptions.

posting abusive messages, but it will prevent spam.
Limiting the number of abusive anonymous messages one can post is an

way to do this would be to subscribe to two lists receiving duplicate messages.
Bandwidth is a problem.  This list distributes about 50 2K messages to 1500

IANAL, but this ruling is not as bad as it may seem.  If I read it correctly,
the ruling says that a judge is allowed to consider offenses related to the
crime for which the defendant was convicted regardless of whether or not the
defendant was acquitted of those charges.  Judges are allowed to consider past
criminal convictions or behavior relevant to the crime for which the defendant
was convicted during sentencing.  Sentencing guidelines instruct the judge on
how severe or lenient a sentence should be based on the severity of the offense
and past criminal record.  These facts to not have to be true beyond a
reasonable doubt.
In one case, the defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent
to distribute but was found not guilty of possession of a firearm related to
a drug charge (apparently, this is a crime).  The jury decided that there was
reasonable doubt as to whether the gun had anything to do with the drug
offense.  However, the defendant was sentenced according to the recommended
sentence for someone convicted of a drug offense when there is a weapon
involved.  If possession of a firearm related to a drug offense had not been
a crime, the judge would have been able to give the defendant the same sentence
without having proof that there was not reasonable doubt as to whether the gun
was related to the drug offense.
All this ruling really does is it gives the judge the power to consider all
facts, including those found by a jury to be doubtable, when sentencing the
defendant.  It doesn't allow the judge to sentence the defendant to a higher
punishment than the maximum sentence.  This is a power that judges have when
the defendant does something legal, but has connection to the actual crime.
This ruling just extends that power to include when the action in question is

the first five bytes of the second hash value can be concatenated with the

Any unbroken cipher with a keyspace larger than that of DES would be better.
Blowfish seems to be pretty strong, and it has the added bonus of having a

I will attempt to address the issues you addressed in your post, although I
don't have the original.  You claimed that rsaref was spook-developed and could
have a backdoor in it.  Also, you said that charges were dropped against PRZ
after PGP was redistributed with rsaref.  I'm not sure whether charges were
actually filed against PRZ for patent infringement, but he included rsaref in
later versions to avoid legal problems.  This has nothing to do with PRZ being
charged with illegally exporting PGP.  These charges were dropped right before
the statue of limitations ran out, not after Phil built PGP with rsaref.
The security of rsaref can be verified pretty easily.  Just create a few test
vectors with another rsa implementation such as SSLeay, the rsa perl script,
or Phil's original rsa code.  If the output matches, then there is not a
backdoor in rsa (unless the same backdoor exists in every implementation of
rsa and/or every C compiler).  It could be that there is a way easier than
factoring to break rsa, but in this case, every version of PGP is insecure, not
just >=2.5 (or there might be a way to factor numbers in polynomial time).
The most likely place that there would be a backdoor would be either in the
key-generation algorithm or in the PRNG.  I'm not sure if much of the
key-generation code was changed between PGP 2.3 and 2.5.  There was a bug in
the PRNG that supposedly made it weaker.
Finally, if you're really concerned about rsaref, use the international
version which does not use rsaref (it's also a lot faster).  I know there's
one version that was developed independantly of the other versions from the
2.3 code.  There could be weaknesses in MD5 and IDEA, but MD5 was always used
so if there is a weakness in MD5, then every version of PGP has this weakness.
IDEA was not developed by the USG or anyone that was likely to be influenced
by the USG.  It was also introduced in 2.0, so if there was a weakness in IDEA,
this would mean that every version of PGP >=2.0 would be insecure.
Although I haven't personally scrutinized the PGP source code, I would say that
there is _very_ little chance that there is a backdoor in it.  It might be
insecure, but if this was true, then most crypto programs would also be

The fundamental problem with the current remailer network, as others have
noted before, is that it is a free service open to abuse by anyone.  If
remailers were commercialized, this would eliminate the spam problem and would
provide the remailer operator with resources to legally defend him or herself.
Currently, there is no modivation for an operator to continue the service when
legally threatened.

that due to an FBI investigation into the use of his remailer to mail threats

Consider the fact that Cyberpromo has managed to find an upstream provider
willing to provide connectivity to them, even though they are almost
universally hated by net users.  They have been able to exist because there
is a commercial interest.  I do not doubt that the same would be true for
remailers if they were commercialized.  The only thing that could shut
remailers down would be either legislation or seizing the computers on which
the remailers run as "evidence."  The obvious solution to this would be to run

As far as "obscenely large" key lengths are concerned, 3-key triple DES
uses a 168-bit key.  This is used in many crypto packages, including
export-controlled Netscape, and is being considered as a replacement for
DES in the U.S.  Triple DES will probably also be supported in the next
version of PGP.  Blowfish supports keys as long as 448 bits and RC4
supports keys up to 2048 bits.  The problem with variable length ciphers
is that programs that use them to not actually take advantage of variable
keys and just stick to using keys of a fixed, and small, size.
Using large key sizes for passphrase-based systems is difficult, because
it's just too difficult to remember a passphrase with enough entropy to
make a difference.  Assuming a random passphrase with 6 bits of entropy
per character, over 21 characters would have to be used for there to be
128 bits of entropy.  Systems that use randomly generated keys are
limited only by the amount of available entropy, but then the passphrase
security to encrypt the secret key or physical security become important.
Using excessively long keys does not do much for security, as there are
always going to be weaker links that an attacker can take advantage of.
It doesn't hurt to use a 256-bit key, or larger, but it doesn't do much
good, either.

Very true.  I was not arguing that security should be reduces to the

little good.  Anything over 256 bits is, IMHO, overkill and 160 bits is
enough to make brute-force attacks infeasible.
I'm very suspicious of any cipher with independant subkeys.  Apparently,
this makes chosen-key attacks *very* easy.  Chosen-key attacks aren't

that any one key factored would allow the other keys to be factored
trivially.  I know there are other ways, but I'm not very good with number
Using this technique, it would take about half as long to generate 10,000
public keys.
The basis of PGP is the web of trust.  Keys are signed by people who are
trusted to be competent and truthful, so the user can be sure to a certain
degree that the key really is owned by the person listed in the ID field.
There are problems that arise with this simplistic key management system,

through several different proxies keeps the traffic secret, but reveals
the source and destination of every connection using traffic analysis.  The
NRL Onion Router scheme had this problem, I think.  The way to avoid this
is to maintain constant connections between proxies and endpoints.

I don't think this is much of a problem.  As long as someone is found
dead prematurely, the people who offered money for the assassination
got their wish.  Whether or not it goes to the real killer is
irrelevant.  From the killer's point of view, the problem of whether
or not he will get his payment is easily solved:
Both parties could mutually agree to use an escrow service to take care
of releasing or retaining the money.  The service wouldn't have to be
anonymously run and would remain ignorant of the uses of its service
The payer would put up a certain amount of money either equal to,
greater than, or less than the cost of the killing depending on the
relative reputations of the payer and payee.  If the payee doesn't
claim the money after x number of days, it gets returned to the payer.
If the payee authorizes the release of the money to the payee and the
payee claims it, it goes to the payee.  And if only one authorizes the
release of the money to the payee, it remains with the escrow service.
This prevents the payer from ripping off the payee.  The only flaw is
that the payee could claim the money but the payer could not authorize
its release.  It's a great way to cheat someone out of a large amount
of money, but it doesn't do the cheater any good, because he won't be
able to benefit from it (unless the cheater happens to be the escrow
Bell's idea was basically that demonstrating foreknowledge of the
killing was adequete proof that the person demonstrating this
knowledge was the assassin.  This generalization can be used for
anonymous contract assassinations, also.  The assassin could give
vague information to the payer such as the method of killing, caliber
of bullet used, or the week that the killing is to take place.  In
fact, anonymous contracts could be viewed as the same thing as
AP, except that anonymous assassination contracts don't try to pretend
it's just about betting on someone's death.

It appears that Roth v. United States was the first case before that the
U.S. SC decided that "obscenity" was not protected by the 1st Amendment.
The reasoning was that while offensive, unorthodox, or hateful ideas
are protected by the 1st, they, unlike pornography, have at least *some*
redeeming social value.  The court noted that laws enacted after the
ratification of the U.S. Constitution banned several different kinds of
speech, including profanity, blasphemy, and libel.  It's a very common
tactic for the courts to refer to post-ratification laws to support
limits on Constitutional rights.

I believe that freedom of speech is an absolute right, but I can see
valid arguments, both for and against, the belief that the text of the
1st applies to obscenity.
On a related note, the supreme Court ruled today, in a 6-3 decision,
that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was un-Constitutional.  This
federal law required that States prove that they have a "compelling
interest" to enforce laws that infringe on religious freedom.  This
ruling means that the States can continue to enforce peyote laws
against native Americans and, of course, enforce child porn laws against
anyone and everyone.

It makes sense that the Net.Scum pages would be hosted by Cyperpromotions

@_subject: Re: Crypto implants 
It depends on the circumstances.  If there was any way to extract the
contents of the implant or decrypt anything encrypted using a key stored
in the implant without resorting to surgery, it would probably be legal
to force the suspect to cooperate (assuming that requiring someone to
turn over a crypto key is legal).  Extracting the contents of the implant
without using surgery is non-intrusive and probably legal.  However, if
the only way to recover the needed data is to physically remove the
implant from the suspect's body (though this wouldn't be very practical
for the user), it would be very difficult for LEAs to do this legally.
In one U.S. Supreme Court decision, Winston v. Lee, it was decided that
the State did not have the authority to require someone not convicted of
a crime to submit to surgery so that a bullet could be extracted from
his body and possibly be used as evidence.  There are exceptions, but
the situation would have to be extreme enough to warrant the severe
intrusion.  I would imagine that this ruling would apply to a situation
where someone had an implant with information that could be used as
evidence.  There isn't much difference, IMO, between extracting a
bullet that has information in the form of caliber and unique markings
useful in a ballistics test and extracting a data implant that has
information electronically stored.

72:  Are there any security risks in GNU Emacs?
  * the file-local-variable feature (Yes, a risk, but easy to change.)
    There is an Emacs feature that allows the setting of local values for
    variables when editing a file by including specially formatted text
    near the end of the file.  This feature also includes the ability to
    have arbitrary Emacs Lisp code evaluated when the file is visited.
    Obviously, there is a potential for Trojan horses to exploit this
    feature.
    If you set the variable inhibit-local-variables to a non-nil value,
    Emacs will display the special local variable settings of a file that
    you visit and ask you if you really want them.  This variable is not
    mentioned in the manual.
    It is wise to do this in lisp/site-init.el before building Emacs:
      (setq inhibit-local-variables t)
    If Emacs has already been built, the expression can be put in
    lisp/default.el instead, or an individual can put it in their own
    .emacs file.
    The ability to exploit this feature by sending e-mail to an Rmail user
    was fixed sometime after Emacs 18.52.  However, any new package that
    uses find-file or find-file-noselect has to be careful about this.
    For more information, see `File Variables' in the on-line manual
    (which, incidentally, does not describe how to disable the feature).

@_subject: Re: Getting ecash without an MTB account 
There are two ways of handling the double spending problem.  One is online
clearing where the bank keeps a database of all deposited coins.  The
merchant immediately deposits the coin and the bank compares it to a
database of all spent coins.  If the coin has already been spent, the bank
sends an error message to the merchant, and presumably, the transaction
is halted.  If the coin has not been spent, the bank adds the coin to its
database of spent coins and credits the merchant's account.  This simply
prevents double spending and does not attempt to identify the person
The other protocol is very complex and involves an interactive protocol
to reveal one half of the payer's identity which is split using a simple
XOR.  When a coin is double spent using this protocol, the payer's identity
is revealed.  I don't know if this protocol can be used for double-blinded
coins, but even if it could, there wouldn't be many advantages over
online clearing.

The militia is different from the military force.  The U.S. Constitution
explicitly states in Article I, Section 8, that the militia may be called
forth (by the federal government) to enforce federal law.  The army and
other military forces, however, were not given this power and were not
intended to be permanent establishments, either.  The reason for the
establishment of the militia was to provide for a permanent defense force
avoiding the dangers to liberty of a standing army.  The army was never
intended to be used for law enforcement and could only be used against
American citizens in a time of rebellion, such as the Civil War.  Over
a hundred years ago, the Posse Comitatus Act was passed which forbid the
military from arresting or questioning American citizens.

@_subject: Re: Inside the Cypherpunks Cult (fwd) 
The states have more control over the militia than the federal government.
Also, it is important to keep in mind, that at the time the Constitution
was ratified, the militia consisted of every able-bodied, white man between
the ages of 18 and 45.  Because the militia consisted of "ordinary" people
instead of professional soldiers, it was not seen as a risk to liberty
like a standing army, much in the same way that trial by jury is not as
dangerous to liberty as trial by a military commission.  Hamilton wrote
in Federalist "There is something so far-fetched and so extravagant in the idea of
danger to liberty from the militia, that one is at a loss whether to
treat it with gravity or with raillery... .  Where in the name of
common-sense, are our fears to end if we may not trust our sons, our
brothers, our neighbors, our fellow-citizens?  What shadow of danger
can there be from men who are daily mingling with the rest of their
countrymen... ."
The purpose of the Constitution was not to explicitly deny certain powers
of the federal government, but to explicitly grant powers to the federal
government.  The ninth and tenth amendments make this very clear.
The army can only be funded for two years at a time.  Congress renews
funding every two years to the army.  The army cannot exist without
Congress' approval.  A prohibition of a "standing army" would not have
been very meaningful given that there is no clear definition of this
The "drug war" activities of the army are perfectly within the limits of
the Posse Comitatus Act.  Military officers watch out for drug
traffickers and call out law enforcement to make an arrest.  The military
cannot make any arrests themselves.  This probably violates the spirit of
the Posse Comitatus Act, but not the letter.  I'm not exactly sure of the
historical context of the Posse Comitatus Act, but I do think it was
passed in reaction to the powers the president gained during the Civil War.
Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus and instituted martial law
without Congress' approval, which is almost certainly unconstitutional.
As late as 1870, some people were still being tried by military commission
even though the Civil War had already ended.  This was probably the case of
Congress reacting to an unconstitutional exercise of power on the part of
the president and the military rather than abolishing a constitutionally
protected practice.
