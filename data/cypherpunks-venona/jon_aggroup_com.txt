Simple, read the cookie specs on the NetScape site. :)

When it sends the mail, netscape puts your email address that you put
into the message in the From: field. This is what that JavaScript is
doing. It is not reading any of your files or doing anything "illegal",
it is just taking advantage of the way that Netscape sends email. ;)
Obviously, either putting nothing or a bogus email address will cause
you to not get a confirmation e-mail.
It is one of those "why didn't I think of it" things. ;) Simple
yet effective. :)

you loose any cool stuff that cool sites give you. we are using them
(along with searchArgs) for a client to allow a "buddie" to follow
you around the site....when you come back, the buddy tells you how long
you have been gone, etc...a really cool fun harmless application of
cookies that makes the user experience much more fun and personal...
if you don't keep the format, navigator will probably remove that line
when it starts up.
if you keep the format, and have edited the cookie, the site on the
other end might not know what to do with the cookie when it gets it
again...(depends on how good the error checking, etc is...)
either way, contrary to popular belief, cookies really aren't a
security risk because they don't contain any information that you
don't already know. if a site gives you a cookie with your password in
it ( especially in clear text ), then they (the cgi programmers) are
idiots and should be shot on the spot.

Scott must have. Navigator is very picky about where a cookie comes
from and what is put in the domain field of the cookie.
Go read about the domain field in the Cookie spec. Then, write a CGI
to play with setting/deleting cookies yourself. You will find out that
it is actually almost an art to even get a cookie set.
Maybe this scott wyant guy works for doubleclick? ;)
No sh*t. The cookie spec says that as well.
There is no such thing as a "cookie request". It is up to the browser
to send the cookie and up to you to parse it out of the HTTP header.
There is no way that the browser is going to send the cookie unless
the domain and path matches. Go read the Cookie spec.
Whatever. What are you saying doesn't make any sense if you knew what
the heck you were talking about.
No duh. Navigator doesn't fflush() the cookie file until you quit. It
keeps it in memory for speed.
Who cares if you can't control them? They don't contain any
information that you don't already know about!
Navigator 3.0 has a preference.

This is my favorite example...
You work at a company.
Evil co-worker there says...check out this webpage I just setup.
You goto that page, the server gives you a cookie with
confidential information.
( 4k can store a lot of data..:) )...
Boss comes around and looks at your cookie file, notices
confidential information.
You get fired, sued, whatever....
Yes, but you know the server that sent it. A Set-Cookie header can't
set the domain to be other than the domain that the cookie came from.
The message that was copied to the list implied that one domain could set
a cookie for another domain. That isn't true unless you have access the
the persons cookie file. ( as you implied in your response, but which
is beyond the scope of the original letter ).

The simple ( unsupported ) fix is to change the strings (they show up
twice in the resources) with a resource editor such as resedit.

I can see it now. Apartments full of geeks because the apartments
were originally built with 100BaseX to each place and a T3 in the
basement going direct to the local ISP.
Tack on another $200/month or whatever to the apartment cost ( geeks
can afford that for sure ) and one might end up having a pretty nice
online melrose place.
I wonder if anybody has done that yet...
