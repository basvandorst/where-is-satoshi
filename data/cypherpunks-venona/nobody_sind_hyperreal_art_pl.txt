Thank you for asking, R /\ D G /\ \/\/ D!
The best way to obtain tons of free stuff is called the "smash and grab"
technique. It needs to be modified, however. First, not many people know
that the police will actually help you load this free stuff into your
rented moving truck if you only call and ask. Make sure you tell them
exactly where you will be and exactly what time you'll be there, or they
won't be able to help! The police are really busy people, though, so you need to make their job
as easy as possible. A few minutes before they get there, break the front
window of the store and begin loading stuff yourself. This works! Really! I swear!
Oh, you should upgrade to 32-bit AOL as soon as possible. Reports indicate
that it increases AOLers' I.Q. points to an acceptable level.

X-Status: Would you like to get a pay raise next week without asking your boss?   Then this very special report, "Money Power," is for you!
If you have a regular job - not working in your own or a family business - and you get a regular paycheck, we can show you how you can give yourself a HUGE RAISE in your very next paycheck.  At least between 20% - 30% more than what you are getting now.  Yes, your paycheck will be increased substantially!
No Gimmicks!  Everything is perfectly legal.
"Money Power" is written in three parts:
This is NOT a "get rich quick" scheme or some other scam.  We are sure you have seen lots of them.  And this is NOT a "tax protester" who refuses to pay income taxes.  The author of this report pays taxes every year - of course, as little as legally possible.  It's our opinion it is not good to zero out completely.  But, you can - it's your choice.
Using the methods in this report, the rich become richer.  And poor people become poorer when they don't take advantage of these techniques.  Your chances of being audited by the IRS - just for using these methods - are near zero.
                      ---------------------------------
Now, here's one more offer you will find hard to refuse.  We have a Reseller Program whereby you can make money selling this report.  When you purchase "Money Power," you will also get 1,000 FREE places to advertise on the Internet!  If you want to make some extra money - $500, $1,000 or more - just post ads on those sites and have the orders come to you.  For every order you send us, we will pay you $5.00:
All you have to do is send us the orders.  We'll process checks, money orders, and credit cards and we will pack and mail the report.  And you get paid twice a month - on the 15th and the 30th!
                     ------------------------------------
And, listen.  America is a free country.  If you don't want an increase in your paycheck, that's fine.  And if you don't want to know how to protect your family, that's OK, too.  And if you don't want to save money on taxes, that's quite all right.  You are living in a free country.
But, if you need money - more money in your paycheck, act right now!  The author of this report used to work for Corporate America earning over $100,000 a year.  After paying almost 40% in Federal taxes, 6.2% for Social Security, 1.45% for Medicare, 1.5% for the unemployment fund, and 3% for his employee benefits, he would bring home less than half of his yearly salary!  And then there was state income tax to pay!   He decided he had to do something so he could keep all the money!
"Money Power" is the result of the author's frustration and aggravation with the system and the research he did to change his situation.  These are methods they don't teach you in school!
It can't get much better than this.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity because you may not receive this message again.  And you know how it is with opportunities ..... if you pass on one, you are not entitled to another for a long time.
Don't Delay!  The longer you wait to order, the longer you will wait for your raise!!!!

Good luck. We're in the same boat. I'm using Andrew Mileski's patches,
but they're outdated, only implement CAST-128 and IDEA, and the user
interface leaves a lot to be desired. Writing a new user interface
is on my project list, but of course I can't export the thing.
Andrew Mileski  has patches available via FTP from fractal.mta.ca, but they're very outdated. I think they're against 2.1.64,
but they'll run with kernels up to the 90s. Kernels after about 2.1.105
are hopelessly broken with regard to Andrew's patches, so I wouldn't advise
even trying it. If you use his patches, use kernel 2.1.105 or below.
I think those are in /pub/aem/crypto.
There are several different versions floating around. There was some set
of patches on ftp.csua.berkeley.edu but they're outdated too. There was a
hole in some DES code somebody was distributing. Again, good luck.
Every time I've used CFS it has locked up into some kind of recursive loop
where it eats more and more CPU time until it finally takes all it can get.
Other people have had the same problem on both Linux and BSD. Other people
never have any problems. No clue why.

                  times as large and the population is five times larger.                   Deaths and injuries from police shootings have resulted in almost $8 million
                  in court settlements and judgments against the district in the last six months,
                  the report said.                   "The spate of police shootings in the district this decade is closely tied to the
                  training and supervision of officers and the way the department investigates
                  cases and holds officers accountable," the newspaper said.                   It said police shootings began to rise at the same time the department added
                  a large number of new, ill-prepared recruits and adopted the light-trigger,
                  highly advanced Glock 9 mm handgun as the department's service weapon.                   On the other side of the coin, eight district police officers were slain in
                  Washington from 1990 to 1997, a number the Post said was surpassed in
                  only a half-dozen other U.S. cities, each much bigger than the district.                   After meeting last week with Post reporters to discuss their findings, Police
                  Chief Charles Ramsey, who took office this year, tightened the department's
                  policy on using force.                   He also announced that in January, the department will begin additional
                  training for all officers in firearms and alternatives to the use of deadly force.                      Copyright 1998   The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This

"Sorry for the mixup, Comrade Cashton. We're about to go find some pretty young 15 year old girls to strip search and do body cavity

   John Gilmore may be right, but remember folks that in Europe we
   have this thing the Greeks invented called democracy. One of the
   ideas of democracy is that decisions are not made in secret closed
   meetings.
Yes, and people democratically demand government enforcement of the
majority will, something made more difficult if the subjects have
strong cryptography.
As Donn Parker observed several years ago, strong cryptography is
inconsistent with democracy.  (Published in Scientific American ---

John Gilmore  writes
   Some countries actually seem to care what their citizens think
   about their crypto laws, unlike the shining example of democracy,
   the USSA.  And when we educate the citizens, they tend to make the
   right choices.  Let's keep trying.
But don't educate them too much, or they will understand that
cryptography can set people free, and if people were free there would
be no political government, and if there were no political government
their social security checks would stop coming, along with all their
other government ``benefits''.

Good question. That's why I wouldn't use it either. (I haven't had reason to
use it, so 'll take Anonymous's word that source isn't available.)
If people want to release software like this, they need a better argument
for its security than "Trust us, it's secure." Considering that there is no net loss when developers of such a product
release source code so that people can look it over and compile it
themselves, I don't have any reason to trust such software.

@_subject: Survey Says Citizens Feel 'Threatened' By Government 
A survey has suggested that up to half a million American    citizens may have been upset by something they have heard
   about the government.
   The USG poll shows that one in five of nearly 4,000 citizens    between the ages of six and 16 interviewed for the survey between
   September and October this year were "uncomfortable" with some
   content heard about the government.
   In the US, 60 million citizens are estimated to know who Clinton
   actually is - roughly a third of all citizens between 18 and 60.
   Of those who have had negative experiences with the government,
   the largest proportion - 40% - has seen something "unconstitutional."
   'Not surprised'
   One in seven said they had encountered unconstitutional actions
   that "freightened them", while 25% saw actions that they thought
   "would get them into jail."
   USG Associate Shill Rob Lawson described the numbers as a    "significant minority".
   The citizen's charity DNC Welfare for Deadbeats suggested the survey
   strengthened calls for government regulation to protect the eyes of
   citizens.
   Libertarian spokesman John Carr said: "I regret to say I'm not surprised    by this survey's findings, it's what we have been saying for some time."
   Government nannies
   "Big Brothers need to know their citizens are looking for pro-USG
   information in safety and security. At the moment, they have no way of    knowing that at all."
   DNC Welfare for Deadbeats, which steals from the citizens to give to    those who are multiplying like rabbits with no means to provide for    their offspring, and advises the government to spend more money and to
   legislate special privlidges for some citizens who are "disadvantaged,"
   backs the introduction of "Big Brothers" - laws which filter out content
   unsuitable for citizens.
   The survey, called TLA.net, was paid for by Microsoft, the NOW, NAI and
   KRAP in syndicate.    The Ministry of Truth and Propoganda's forthcoming review on Internet
   regulation is expected to be published before Christmas.

An NBC reporter in Baghdad reported that the Iranian embassy was hit by a
Tomahawk, but I've had the news off since then and haven't heard anything
else about it. The Klinton White House won't come out and admit that they
missed, just like they won't admit that a Tomahawk landed in someone's
house last night (again according to NBC).
You are wrong, though. Comrade Klinton is worse than Comrade Hyde and the
rest. The loyal card-carrying Party members in congress are limited in power
because the majority of them have to agree on an issue. Comrade Klinton can
do virtually whatever he wants with the military under the War Powers Act
and doesn't have to answer for it until it's all over.
As I recall, the name "Desert Fox" was a nickname held by a Nazi general.
Fitting, that.

And while we're being hypocritical and stealing (oh, it's okay because it's

crypto may help end spam.
Right. About the only thing you people are going to accomplish is to
alienate anybody who might care what you have to say. While you're spamming,
maybe you can even make the Cypherpunks look really bad. Hell, go ahead and
put the list address as the "From" address. It will shut down the list, make
us look like idiots, and accomplish very little, but it's for a good cause.
After all, the ends always justify the means. When the USG wants to storm
your home with a squad of ninjas, that's okay, so long as they're checking
for drugs or other evil things. Since it will keep us all safe, let's
eliminate privacy rights.
The idea of spamming for "educational purposes" is the most obscene and
stupid I've heard on this list in a while. Both of you read "The Prince" one
too many times.
