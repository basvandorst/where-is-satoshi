You are right but the question is: what do you want to sign/encipher,
the message body or the whole message exchange?
We thinked about this when we developed a piece of software
for the European Space Agency which is called EDIDOC server (Electronic Data Interchange of Documents).
In our case, SMTP header signing was anyway not acceptable
because we needed to support various communication means.
I won't go into too much details but EDIDOC is acting as a central server for information exchange with value added as:
- a clearing house
- security gateway
- communication gateway
- a gateway at document format level
- groupware aspects

For more information, send an e-mail to edidoc-info
ESA/ESRIN has some information at BIM Engineering as a home page ( which should
"soon" include information about the server
