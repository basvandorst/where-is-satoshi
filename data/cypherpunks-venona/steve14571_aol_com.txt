I assume that C$ is only filtering the newsfeed as it hits German shores?
Please tell me
they aren't denying access to these "banned" newsgroups for all users
This is exactly what they are doing, Mr. Neely.  I am not familiar with
CompuServe, as I have never used it.  However, based on my understanding of
how Usenet operates, it would be possible to write software and incorporate
it into CompuServe software that would block German readers from the
"obscene" newsgroups.  CompuServe would rather score points with the mostly
ignorant general public by saying that they are becoming more
I get my access through America Online, and I am afraid that these monolith
online services (AOL, Delphi, Prodigy) will follow C$'s lead so they may also
say they are "family-oriented."
I will no longer send mail to addresses that end with "compuserve.com."  If
AOL decides to become family oriented, I will look for other ways to connect
to the net.

Hi Stephen,
:-) As I can see. How did you generate this key? Are you using a
special version of PGP?
Maybe something about myself to start with:
I'm from Belgium (that small spot between France, Germany and the
Netherlands). I work in a bank (no, this does not mean that I'm
swimming in money!) as a system engineer. We work mainly with A-Series
mainframes from UNISYS. At home I spent some time on the internet, my
PC, reading a good book and last but not least having a beer with my

Happy New Year!
Whoever sent me this message please write back, and send a public key so that
I can respond.

I see two possible ways to censor German users only (but I still believe
censoring anyone is wrong).  First, the "main computers" could be told where
they are, and "censored" material could be filtered at that level before it
is sent to individual users.  Or CompuServe could release a software update
for German users.  The software would not recognize banned newsgroups.  How
difficult could that possibly be?
