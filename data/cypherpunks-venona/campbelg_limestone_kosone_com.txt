As a lurker on the list, I'd like to second this opinion. The cypherpunks
list is held up to be this almighty oracle of cryptographic information.
Yet, every time I subscribe to it (this is the fourth time in a year) I have
to wade through irrelevant personal attacks and various other rubbish. I
mean, really. This is worse than Fidonet.
However, I suppose that with any gathering of (mostly) intelligent, liberty
and privacy minded people, there are likely to be clashes of one sort or
another. If the anonymous twits will grow up and stop stirring things up,
maybe the rest of us can learn something.

What about Private Idaho? It's fairly simple to use and even has built-in
routines to setup and use accounts at C2.
It boggles the mind the number of goofy rules and regs you yanks have to
deal with. The various branches of your government can't get along enough to
pass a budget, yet they're worried about the rest of the world using strong
encryption. Gordon R. Campbell, Owner - Mowat Woods Graphics

Very true. Up here (Canada), we have _much_ less of the "use the courts as a
weapon of harrassment" phenomenon. But, I don't believe we have a (much)
lower percentage of lawyers than you do.
It's part of the mindset. Somehow, over the course of several generations,
you folks have become an entirely too litigious lot for your own good. The
result is was PRZ just came through and the multitude of cases that the
Church of Sceintology is involved in.
How to fix it? Beats me. However, I think it will probably have to start
with the judiciary. Justices from all levels of your court system will have
to put their collective feet down and stop allowing this kind of nonsense. I
don't know enough about the inner workings of the legal systems to know if
this would be all that's needed. Perhaps some new legislation would also be
Whatever happens, it can only be for the better. In the meantime, could you
get your damn lawyers off my tv? ;-) We don't let our lawyers do that.
They've only been able to advertise at all in the last 10 years or so.

I'm not a psychologist, but I'd guess that by the time a crack is released,
knowledge of a problem is so widespread, that the company responsible can't
ignore it. Kind of an ostrich thing.

@_subject: What happened to Aegis? 
After doing a total reinstall of my system (don't ask) I discovered that I
don't have a copy of the Aegis PGP Shell distribution archive anywhere. I
attempted to grab it from  as listed in the docs,
but the site doesn't exist.
Doesn anybody know what gives and where I can get a new copy of the archive?
I really like this shell and haven't figured out how to otherwise integrate
PGP with EudoraPro.
Any other suggestions are also welcome.

I've file-attached a first attempt at something like this to Robert Hayden
(the original poster.) It's the international 'no' sign superimposed over a
drooling baby.
If he likes it and is able to post it somewhere, he's free to do so. I'd
post it myself, but I have no web access (not yet, anyway).
