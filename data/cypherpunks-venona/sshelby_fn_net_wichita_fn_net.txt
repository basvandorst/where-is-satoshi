@_subject: Spam, and how to stop it. 
Hello all.  I assist in running an ISP.  We recently had a problem with some of the users massmailing from our server.  We would have never known, but someone on CompuServe that didn't like it mailed our support email address.  We checked into it, and I called the two people voice.  It pretty gratifying to be able to talk to one of these spammer massmailer 'get rich quick' scheme people directly.  What I'm looking for is a way to monitor the amount of mail leaving the system per user.  I'm not interested in poking into users mail, but I would like the ability to spot other users sending out more than x messages per x minutes.  If anyone has any tips on this subject I'd like to hear them.  Spam and massmailing is one of the major things that's bogging down the net these days, I believe.
