@_subject: Cool story. 
I'm in the Air Guard and have been for almost 10 years. I work in the crypto vault, which is really really boring. but we keep it interesting by shreading pieces of cardboard in the outer vault and yelling to my chief "...O.K. CHIEF...I'M SHREADING THE PICTURES OF THE CRASH SITE IN NEVADA...YOU WANT ME TO SHREAD THEM ALL?"
Anyhow, last summer our material controller got tasked by (I think) the OSI to do this emergency audit on this unit's material control section up in Washington.  There's these cool safes that we use to store our cryto in that look kinda like the ones behind Trey at:
These safes are only build and sold for DOD use; you can't buy them as civilians.  At least these specific ones are.
So it turns out that the guy who was in charge of the supplies of this unit was selling all kinds of stuff at his garage sales, including some of these safes.  This civilian bought a safe and a year or so later it stopped working, so he called the phone number on the metal tag thats on the safe.  The conversation went like this:
Safe manufacturer:  Hello?
Civilian:  Yeah, I got this safe of yours and its broken.
SM:  What unit are you with?
C:  HUH?
SM:  Who are you?
C:  Look, I don't like your attitude.  What does it matter who I am...who     are you?!?  I want this thing fixed.
SM:  Are you with the military?
C:  No, why would I be?
SM:  Can I put you on hold for a second, please don't hang up.
You can guess the rest.  It didn't take them long to figure out what happened, and the material control guy who sold the safe cut town. but they got him.  At least that's how I heard it.  I hate to relay these things second hand, but looking at Trey's picture made me remember it.

I agree.  It all comes down to money, as you all know.  Do you think the bean counters and lawyers at MS see it proitable to announce such a obvious problem, no doubt running the risk of being unfavorably depicted in the ignorant mass media as offering a product that is "insecure?"  We all know what the responcible thing to do is.  I suspect marketing has a hand in quelling the idea of announcing this problem.  That's why I agree..
to a point.

Of what was I thinking!?!  I owe all a big apology; I hope my habit of living my life on the edge of a knife didn't jepordize everyone.  Man, do I feel like a slob.  Thank you Tim!  ;)

Speaking of Altavista, check this data for the host Export list for mts-gw.pa.dec.com decpa
mts-gw.pa.dec.com decpa
I told them about this via e-mail almost three weeks ago when I told them about being able to get different host's /etc/passwd file from a search.  But I guess that's the way they want it.  This probably isn't the appropriate forum, but obviously they don't care.  Does anyone know a better way to tell them?  Maybe I'm just paranoid.  Its just that I kind of feel sorry for DEC; its not easy being burdened with the worst marketing staff in the world, having the world's fastest RISC processor, and having the media go wild over the P6.
Flames welcomed.....I'm homesick and need the abuse...:)

@_subject: Re: When they came for the Jews... 
I really wish I had the original newspaper clipping so I correctly quote the column, but it went something like this:
Here in Portland, Oregon, we used to have quite a problem with Nazi skinheads.  Not that they are not around now, but then they were everywhere.  Being that most of the city is white trash, you'd think it wouldn't have caused much of a ruckus if they were simply beating up minorities.  But its been my personal experience that they would prefer beating up "fellow" whites instead.  That, coupled with the murder of Saraw, seemed to stir things up against the skinheads.  Anyhow, that's my background to it.  The column didn't talk about that.  It was this guy writing about the Banai Brith (spelling?) in Los Angeles getting critisism about gathering and keeping records on suspected skinheads.  Turns out they got alot of that stuff from Portland's own Multnomah County Sheriff, who releases thier police reports as public information.  So this reporter decided to get some of these reports, and some of the records that the banai brith were keeping, and printed some.  Like I was saying, public opinion at the time was way against the skinheads, and I was more than a little irritated at the time at them because of the roving bands of punks that made life in MY city uncomfortable.  So I read through each police report, really eating it up.  "White male, (his name,) apprehended for distributing nazi literature."  "White female, (her name,) questioned.  Wearing a jacket with a swastika."  Stuff like that.  Then the reporter lowered the boom.  He asked us in the reading audience to substitute "skinhead" and "nazi" with "hippy" or "communist," and see how we felt about that.  This was a very unpopular position at the time, in a city hell bent on getting rid of these skinheads, but he made a good point with me.  Maybe someone could tell me how I could get a hold of the original.  The paper is the Oregonian.  I could probably figure out the reporter's name...if I only had a brain.  I'd love to post it.
Again, flames are always welcomed, as I am home sick and could use the abuse.
