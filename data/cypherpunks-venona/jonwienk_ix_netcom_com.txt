@_subject: Re: Opiated file systems 
Here is an idea for implementing DuressSFS and/or NukeTheData functions on demand with plausible deniability for all (without all your keys, TLA's wouldn't know how many encrypted partitions you had:
1. Doing anything with the encrypted file system requires 2 keys.
2. The first key decrypts the FAT (the FAT info is always written to the disk encrypted) and an encrypted control sector, which is cylinder 0, head 0, sector JustAfterTheMBRAndPartionTable.  This control sector is divided into 16 32-byte (256-bit) fields or records.
3. If a hash of the key entered matches the undecrypted contents of record 0, (bytes 0-31) the EFS enters an infinite whole-drive encryption loop, using a hash of the key provided and any handy entropy, to produce a new key.  The EFS will produce new keys as frequently as possible by hashing any entropy it can gather while nuking the data on the drive. While this is happening, dummy messages should be displayed, such as "Starting Windows 95...", "An exception has ocurred at XXXX:XXXXXXXX  Press any key to continue." (when the entropy stock needs replenishment) or any other reasonably common startup messages. (NukeTheData) (TM)
4. If the first key is not the NukeTheData key, the EFS prompts for a second 5. After receiving the second key, the EFS hashes it and compares the hash to the data in the control sector records, and mounts any encrypted logical drive(s) with matching key hashes.
6. If an incorrect second key is entered X times(X between 3 and 20), (NukeTheData = True) is assumed, and executed.
Using this system, without the first key, it should be impossible to tell how many separate encrypted logical drives there are on the disk. Without the second key(s) the data in the ELD's should be worthless.  On bootup, the pass phrase entry screen should be designed to look exactly like the CMOS bootup password screen, and no messages indicating the existence of EFS should be displayed until after a correct 2nd key has been entered.  Why advertise your security measures?  Unless "they" have been tipped off to the fact that you use EFS, they can easily destroy all of the data through ignorance, especially if you have a PostIt note with the NukeTheData password/phrase (which wouldn't have to be "good"--you could use "GovtStupid" or something similar) stuck to the side of your monitor, and keep your mouth shut during interrogation.

If you lock your doors and windows, forced entry generally becomes a noisy, somewhat time-consuming process that allows anyone not in a recreational drug induced stupor or coma sufficient time to pull a pistol out of their shoulder holster (or nightstand drawer, etc.) and pull the hammer back.  (2-3 seconds is all I need!)
In the majority of cases, (although the margin is on the decline) when an armed homeowner confronts a burglar, the burglar runs like projectile diarrhea for the nearest exit, and no shots are fired.  However, these incidents are not counted as firearms "use", under current crime statistic collection methodology.  Many of these incidents are not reported, especially in areas where gun ownership is not approved by the authorities.  Furthermore, if your Cousin Vinnie the crack addict breaks into your house at 0300, attempts to rob you at knifepoint, and you force-feed him half a dozen jacketed hollow points for his trouble, the incident will usually be put in the same statistical category as the "crazed husband shoots wife, children, 11 neighbors, and 6 police officers" tragedies, even though you may never be charged with anything.  Most "studies" of crime statistics come from gun control advocacy groups, and are suitable primarily for lining the bottoms of birdcages.
I have $10 US that says that this idiot has never fired a gun is his life.  Furthermore, it is obvious he has no clue when it comes to bullet/target interaction.  A "reversed semi-wadcutter" is going to stay in its original shape (for the most part), which will tend to make it over-penetrate, wasting kinetic energy and endangering people behind the target.  Moreover, anyone who intentionally uses an inaccurate load is a fool--missed shots waste ammo, have no effect on the target, and run a significant risk of endangering innocent people.  A hollow point or Glaser is a much better option.

As I write this, I am listening to the news coverage of the bombing in Centennial Park.  The ABC news reports are already linking the suspected Georgia Militia members accused of plotting to use pipe bombs at the Olympic Games.  Just like OKC, the militia-gun owner-right-wing extremist smear is gearing up before the blood has a chance to dry.  On the other hand, the govt seems to be awfully reluctant to admit the obvious about TWA 800...
[End Rant]
Here is the how the voting system works.
1.  All voting information (public keys, ballots, ballot signatures, etc.) is publicly available via a Web site or other similar means, and can be downloaded in its entirety by anyone who cares to take the trouble to do so.  The software (and source code) used to generate ballots should be publicly available as well.
2.  When someone registers to vote, they submit a RSA public key to a registered voter key database.  The public key database does not contain voter information; only keys.  Access to the key entry terminals is controlled, so that only registered voters can submit keys.  A receipt is given to the voter with a hash of the key printed on it (PGP fingerprint style), the key entry clerk's name,  a receipt serial number, etc., so the voter can verify the correct key was put in the system, and who to shoot if it wasn't.
3.  On election day, each voter submits a ballot signed with their private key. The ballot contains the fingerprint of the voter's public key, the voter's choices, (preferably in a standardized ASCII format) and the digital signature. The ballot goes into the vote database regardless of whether it is valid or not. The voter receives a printed receipt confirming that the ballot was entered in the database, with a hash of the entire ballot (headers, signature, and all), receipt serial number, etc.
4.  After the election, each voter can verify whether their public key and ballot are in the database, and see whether their vote is deemed valid or not (if the signature on the ballot can be verified by a key in the key database). If there are any discrepancies, the voter has the public key, the ballot, and the receipts to prove that his vote should be counted.
5.  Since the key/vote databases are not connected to individuals, no one can connect votes to voters unless cheating occurs during the registration process. If there is fraud or other errors, the key/ballot/receipt combo is all that is necessary to prove the error--no identification of the bearer is required.
6.  Keys in the system should expire every few years.
Any comments / constructive criticisms welcome.

@_subject: Re: Publicly Verifiable Anonymous Voting System 
To the extent that no link is recorded between a particular key and a particular voter, the system is anonymous. As I said in the original post, if the govt cheats during the key registration process, the system is not anonymous. However, if the registered voter database and the key/ballot database are on non-connected, separate systems, it is certainly possible to devise a key registration protocol to ensure anonymity.
Here is a more detailed description of the registration method:
1.  The registration process takes place in two separate rooms, one anonymous, and one non-anonymous, which are staffed by separate people, with separate computer systems.  The only way to enter/exit the anonymous room is via the non-anonymous room.
2.  The voter enters the non-anonymous room, where he provides proofs of identity and residence and is entered in the registered voter database, which is NOT publicly available.
3.  Once the voter has demonstrated eligibility, he is given a token that designates him as a registered voter, but has no personal information. A hard-to-counterfeit carved rod (too large to conceal on one's person) or something similar would be a good choice.
4.  The token gives the voter clearance to enter the anonymous room. Upon presenting the token, the voter inputs his key into the key database. (Insert your key disk in drive A and press Enter...) After the key has been entered into the system, the voter is given the receipt indicating that his key has been entered in the key database.
5.  The voter goes back to the non-anonymous room.  He turns in the token, signs a statement indicating that he entered a key and received a receipt for it, (to prevent voters from registering more than one key and thus voting more than once) and then goes home.

@_subject: Re: Stop the presses -- Anti-terrorism bill not that bad 
In addition to powder residue, collect all the spent shell casings you can, especially ones that are of the same caliber as weapons you own. In addition to the possibility of reloading them (and saving a bundle on ammo costs) you can sprinkle them around liberally in the aftermath of an encounter (assuming you survive) and give the crime scene people a bunch of red herrings to deal with. Of course, you should never touch them, (the FBI got DNA samples from stamps the Unabomber licked on his mailbombs, so even tiny droplets of sweat can bust you) and you should collect the actual brass fired and sandblast it.
Incidentally, one of the interesting traits of a shotgun is that buckshot is not subject to the ballistics matching techniques used on rifle and pistol bullets. The plastic wads (which prevent the shot from touching the barrel) do not take the microscopically detailed impressions from the barrel that copper or lead bullets do. The heat from firing always melts the plastic slightly--enough to defeat this.  Of course, if you leave the fired shells lying around, the primer and ejector marks can bite you...
Of course, this means that every time they lose your luggage, you will be detained for "suspected terrorist activity", and the plane your luggage was wrongly sent to will be evacuated while the bomb squad takes it to a remote area and blows it up... (the luggage, not the plane)

A much better idea is to clean the barrel with a stiff wire brush. If you blue the inside of the barrel, and then brush the bluing off, that is enough. Alternatively/additionally, fire several hundred rounds with the weapon.  Either will change the microscopic pattern of grooves sufficiently to cause a mismatch. Poking a file around in the barrel is a good way to ruin a gun.
Changing barrels is a good idea as well. I can change the barrel on my Desert Eagle in about 15 seconds. A better idea yet is to fabricate a removable silencer (that can be attached/detached without modifying the barrel) with a wire brush surrounding the muzzle opening (similar to a batery terminal cleaner, but sturdier, of course) so that the bristles put their own marks on the bullet as it leaves the barrel. Even if the silencer is found, you will never be able to put it on aligned exactly the same way, and the marks will not line up exactly. Alternatively, you could mount the bristles on a bearing so they can rotate freely, so the patterns of marks constantly change as the brush rotates. Of course, getting caught with a silencer is a good way to go directly to jail without passing GO.
Of course, if you are serious about avoiding this kind of hassle, you will mount a bag to the receiver of your gun to catch the fired shells, so that they aren't lying around for curious people to find.

If the shell cases are NOT left at the crime scene, there is NO link between them and the crime. You are suffering from cranio-rectal inversion.
That doesn't address the fact that (1) there are billions of unstamped shell casing extant, (2) stamping the side of a case will weaken it and be a significant safety hazard, (3) stamps in the head of the case can be filed/scraped off, (4) cases not left at the crime scene have no value as evidence, regardless of any serial stamps, extractor marks, etc. Even if you can prove a shell was fired in a particular gun, if there is no link between that gun and the crime, the "evidence" is worthless.

I would rather be armed and take my chances against a crackhead looking for someone to mug than be disarmed and take my chances against government thugs who have discovered that they can act against the populace with impunity.

@_author: thereby collecting more prints 
@_subject: Re: Stop the presses -- Anti-terrorism bill not that bad 
I am very skeptical of this. When a gun is fired, the shell casing becomes quite hot--hot enough to burn skin. (I have learned this from experience--once when firing my semi-auto .22 at a range, an ejected casing bounced off a post next to me and landed inside my collar. The resulting burn formed a blister on my neck.) This kind of heat has a tendency to evaporate the skin oils that fingerprints are composed of, which is going to make getting any useful print from the case extremely difficult. Also, when the gun is fired, the pressure inside the case presses it flat against the chamber wall, which is going to smudge the print, especially on semi-autos where extraction occurs while there is still a significant amount of pressure in the case. Furthermore, most shell cases are too small to get anything close to a complete print, which makes positive matching even more difficult. It is much more believable that prints were taken from the gun, which is handled more (thereby collecting more prints) and which generally doesn't reach skin-damaging temperatures.
Regardless of feasibility of collecting prints from cases, serial numbers on ammunition is still a stupid idea. Currently, all firearms are required to have serial numbers. However, serial numbers only rarely help solve crimes. Most criminals use weapons that have had the serial number welded over, filed off, etc. or that have been stolen, so the gun is registered in someone else's name, or both. Registration is a vastly more effective tool for the government to know where most of the lawfully owned firearms are (and who owns them) than it is at preventing or solving any crime. Putting serial numbers on ammo has all of the same problems, except the paperwork would be worse because people purchase ammo more frequently than guns.
Imagine someone breaks into your house while you are gone, and steals your serial-numbered gun and serial-numbered ammo. Then he uses them to stick up some of the local Stop-N-Rob's in your neighborhood while wearing the same gloves and ski mask he wore at your house. He fires numerous shots and reloads the gun several times, leaving fired cases in each store. After the last robbery, he dumps the gun in a storm drain, burns the gloves and mask, and catches the next flight to Tahiti. Do you really think that serial numbers on the gun or the ammo are going to help YOU?
Also, 32 bits of serial number is not enough. Over a billion rounds of .22 Long Rifle are fired in the US annually. Need I say more?
Since there are already natural means of positively matching bullets to guns, guns to cases, and guns to fingers, which cannot be used to falsely implicate anyone, , and since the claimed benefits of serial numbering can easily be circumvented by unscrupulous persons (in other words, CRIMINALS) I contend that serial numbers are a much better tool for facilitating a police state than for reducing crime.
obCrypto: How about defining the "number" as an MD5 hash of the X-Y coordinates of the entry points of 15 pellets of 00 buckshot in the criminal's chest, sorted in ascending order X, Y? (ORDER BY X ASC, Y ASC)

In 1981, the city of Kennesaw, GA suffered 17 violent crimes and 55 burglaries. In 1982, Kennesaw passed an ordinance requiring all city residents to own a firearm, and there was only 1 violent crime and 19 burglaries. In 1983, Kennesaw experienced 3 violent crimes and 9 burglaries. I think that the cause-effect relationship is obvious.

@_subject: Re: strengthening remailer protocols 
Instead of that, how about this?
1. Create a pool of N remailers, each with its own set of public/private key pairs.  The public key(s) for each remailer are widely disseminated. Each remailer also publishes a list of other remailers that it will poll for messages. (More about this later.)
2. Each remailer user MUST have at least 1 public/private key pair per nym.  The public key should be widely available.
3. Each message is encrypted with the intended recipient's (nym's) public key, and then with each remailer's public key succesively, but in reverse order. (The message is encrypted last with the public key of the first remailer in the chain.)  The chain is determined by selecting some subset of N at random, with the set growing as the need for security increases. Encryption is done a la PGP, with a header prepended to the message containing the fingerprint of the public key used to encrypt the session key used to encrypt the actual message. Each layer of encryption encrypts the header of the previous layer of encryption as well as the message, so only the last encryption is "visible", and it is not feasible to detect the number of encryptions by examining the message.
4. The multiply-encrypted message is sent to the first remailer in the chain.  The remailer decrypts the message with its private key, and at this point one of two things can happen. If the decrypted message specifies an email address, the remailer sends the message to the specified address. Otherwise, it posts it in a publicly available database with 3 fields. 2 are public; one contains the key fingerprint of the outermost public encryption key, and the other contains the message itself.  The third, private field contains the date/time the record was added to the database. Any appropriate techniques for reducing input/output correlation can be used, such as delaying the decryption for random time intervals, dummy messages between remailers, etc. Remailer-to remailer traffic (or to any nym that gets a lot of traffic) should should be bundled together (take a few hours worth of traffic going to a specific nym, ZIP it into one large message, and re-encrypt using that nym's public key) to prevent a sender from being able to recognize any of his messages in transit.
5. Anyone can do lookups in the public fields of the message database by key fingerprint. Remailer users do this to download their messages, and remailers download messages from other remailers in this manner as well. Anyone can download any message in the database; only the intended recipient will be able to decrypt it. Messages are not deleted when they are downloaded; instead they are kept for a fixed period of time (determined by the remailer operator) and then deleted. If users are required to download other people's messages, tracing a message to one specific person will be much more difficult.
6. Steps 4 and 5 are repeated until the final recipient receives his message and decrypts it, at which time crypto-anarchic utopia can resume.
Randumb Thotz:
Given an encryption program with a database of which remailers poll other remailers, remailer chaining can be automated, and be done randomly.
If 2 nyms can agree to poll a mutually known set of remailers, (such as via anonymous Usenet/Blacknet postings) 2-way anonymous correspondence can occur without either nym having to know the other nym's email address. The remailer operators wouldn't know either, but they may be able to make reasonably informed guesses at recipient-nym relationships via analysis of database browsing patterns.  This is the the weakest part of the proposal, and suggestions for preventing this would be appreciated.
Remailers should use SSL or other encrypted communication protocols to ensure that third parties cannot observe who is browsing what in the public message Jonathan Wienke

You are right, of course, to a point.  Criminal don't fear cops like
vampires fear wooden stakes, or like certain politicians /
three-letter-agencies fear and loathe private gun ownership, or like most

officers, and try to avoid capture and incarceration by same.  (Those who
don't, appear on "America's Dumbest Criminals" or White House press

On the other hand, a homeowner with a 12-gauge riot shotgun or a Desert
Eagle .44 Magnum pistol can instill fear into almost any criminal, even the
stupid ones.  (The only thing I don't like about the Eagle is that a 75+
ounce pistol is rather difficult to conceal.  I have a shoulder holster for

A Cypherpunk To Be Named Later purchases a new hunting rifle and moves to
Alaska to try it out bear hunting.  After a few days of hunting, he sees a
moderately decent-sized black bear, and with one perfectly placed shot,
kills it.  Unfortunately, while watching the black bear collapse, he feels
a tap on his shoulder; turning around, he sees a large brown bear.  "I saw
what you just did," says the bear.  "You have two choices.  Either I maul
you to death, or you and I can step behind that rock over there and engage
in the sort of activity Vulis usually attributes to Timmy Mayonnaise."
Reluctantly, the Cypherpunk accepts the second alternative.
Several days later, when the Cypherpunk is sufficiently recovered to sit
comfortably, he decides to avenge his honor.  After several hours of
stalking, he centers the cross hairs of his riflescope on the brown bear's
[deleted] and fires.  While watching the brown bear die a slow and
agonizing death, he feels a tap on the shoulder.  Turning around, the
Cypherpunk sees an enormous grizzly bear.  "I saw what you just did," says
the grizzly.  "You have two choices.  Either I eat you alive, or you and I
can step behind that tree over there and I will show you what New York City
Police officers really carry batons for."  Reluctantly, the Cypherpunk
accepts the second alternative.
Several weeks later, after the bleeding stops and his toilet schedule
returns to normal, the Cypherpunk once again enters the woods, this time
seeking the grizzly bear.  After searching for several days he finds the
grizzly bear and shoots him.  While he is cutting off the grizzly's
[deleted], he once again feels a tap on the shoulder.  Turning around, he
sees a gigantic polar bear.  The polar bear looks at him and says, "You
don't come out here for the hunting, do you?"

We in the U.S. are approximately where Germany was in the mid-1930's.  The
Holocaust did not start with anti-Semitic genocide; it started with
abortion.  After abortion became popular, infanticide, euthanasia and
assisted suicide were introduced.  (This is where the U.S. is at; witness
Jack Kevorkian and partial-birth infanticide.)  Once these became popular,
they began to become mandatory for individuals that were or were likely to
become a burden to the state.  After that, expanding the focus to include
Jews, Communists, Gypsies, and other groups on Hitler's shit list was a
trivial exercise.  I believe that the same process that happened in Germany
is at work in the U.S.; it is just progressing at a slower rate.
If there is another civil war in the U.S., I believe that the U.N. will
become involved.  I have been hearing stories of Russian soldiers escorting
trespassers out of the U.N. biosphere zones of various national parks for
several years now.  American soldiers may have pangs of conscience when
ordered to fire on fellow Americans, but Russian or Chinese soldiers most
likely wouldn't.  Perhaps acquiring East Bloc weapons isn't such a bad idea
after all if you can steal compatible equipment from the enemy...

If the CMOS chip is socketed (as opposed to soldered in), remove it, wrap

CMOS data including the password, hard drive parameters, date/time, and
other settings maintained there.  If removing the chip is impractical,
unplug the power supply from the motherboard, and remove the battery that
powers the chip.  (Even if it is soldered in, desoldering a 2-pin device is
orders of magnitude easier than desoldering a 40-60 pin DIP)  Once you have
done this, wait for an hour.  When time is up, put everything the way it
was, start the machine, enter the setup program (F1/F10/DEL) and redo all
the settings.  Hopefully, you have them archived with Norton Utilities or

@_subject: Big Brother Is Watching ATMs 
Hash: SHA1
I just heard that a bank card company has just released a program for using
photos of the iris in people's eyes as a biometric ID to replace people's
PIN codes for ATM / credit cards.  What I found really interesting is how
they plan to implement it.  As people use the ATM, they are photographed. (Every ATM has a security camera.)  Over time, as people use the ATM, the
security camera images are composited to produce a high-quality image of
their irises, which is coded and placed in their account information.  Once
this is accomplished, when a card is inserted into the ATM and the security
camera gets an iris image that matches the account sufficiently closely,
the user can conduct transactions without entering the PIN code.  People
affected by this will merely receive a letter that under certain
circumstances, entering the PIN is no longer necessary, but this is not a
security problem.
This scenario may not be a security problem, but it certainly poses a
privacy problem.  Given the frequency that the average Joe Sixpack uses the
ATM, it is only a matter of time before the government mandates a
nationwide eyeprint ID database to catch ATM and credit card theives, money
launderers, tax cheats, and other undesirables.  Perhaps the eyeprint could
even replace or supplement the SSN as the unique taxpayer ID key for tax
and other purposes.  Of course, given the fact that ATMs have had cameras
from the start, this theoretical eyeprint database could already be under
construction.  How's that for paranoia?  >:-(
Of course, there are a few ways to beat this, such as mirror sunglasses,
(which would only be useful while alternative credentials to eyeprint ID
are still available) and contact lenses, (which would have to be carefully
oriented so that the same side of the lens was always up, or the fact that
you are wearing contacts and are therefore a Suspicious Person(tm) would
become obvious to the system) and of course intraocular implants of various
types.  Of course if the implant's power-on LED gives your eyes a constant
Satanic red glow, you may be flagged as a Suspicious Person(tm) anyway.

IANAL, but if I convert my MAK-90 to fire full-auto, and I get caught with

I own a Norinco MAK-90 (a semi-auto only AK variant) and it is designed so
that a round cannot be chambered with the safety on.  If the weapon is not
cocked, the hammer hits the top of the sear (which is locked by the safety)
and prevents the bolt from traveling more than 1 inch to the rear.  If the
weapon is cocked, the charging handle on the side of the bolt hits the
front of the safety lever, which stops the rearward travel of the bolt at
about 2.5 inches, which is not sufficient to chamber a round.  The magazine
can be inserted or removed regardless of the position of the safety or the
On my Winchester 1300 Defender 12-gauge, (a pump gun with a 7-round
magazine) the safety cannot be engaged until the weapon has been cocked,
which requires the action to be cycled.  This will chamber a round unless
the magazine is empty.
On my Norinco Model 320 carbine (a semi-auto only Uzi lookalike) if the
weapon is not cocked, and the grip safety is not depressed, the bolt is
locked in the forward position, which makes it rather difficult to chamber
a round.  However, the safe/fire selector (the sliding button on the left
side of the grip) has no effect on the bolt.  Neither safety has any effect
on inserting or removing a magazine.
One of the oddities of the SKS is that a magazine cannot be inserted or
removed unless the bolt is locked in the rearmost position.  The sides of
the bolt have grooves machined in them that the lips of the magazine occupy
when the bolt is forward.  This can make changing a half-full magazine kind
of annoying.

InfoWar has always been a critical component of MeatWar.  Knowing who your
enemy is and where he is at makes it much easier to do something about him.
 Intelligence (in the military sense) and the tools to deny it to your
enemy (strong crypto) are of equal importance to weapons.  If you know that
a homicidal Postal Service employee is standing outside your front door and
is preparing to blast it off its hinges and then kill you, this
intelligence will do nothing but raise your blood pressure if you have no
weapons with which to deal with the situation.  (Calling 911 isn't going to
help you much.)  If you own several "assault weapons", but are asleep in
the living room when the door comes crashing down, the lack of intel will
greatly reduce the effectiveness of said weapons.
I have an equation for this:  Effectiveness = Intelligence * Force * Will. I define force as the theoretical ability to inflict damage on an opponent,
whether via bad PR, propaganda, lethal or nonlethal weapons, or any other
means.  Force has 2 components:  Materiel and Skill.  Thus, Force =
Materiel * Skill.  (Example:  If I own a riot shotgun and appropriate
ammunition, and have taken it to the range and familiarized myself with its
use, I have the theoretical ability to shoot the aforementioned Homicidal
Postal Employee, but mere ownership of the weapon and skill in its use does
not guarantee that outcome.)  Will is simply the will to fight if
Although government will always have a higher Force factor than an
individual or "the cypherpunks" or a militia, it can be possible to achieve
a higher Effectiveness score via higher Intelligence and/or Will factors. This is how we lost the war in Vietnam.  We had a much higher Force level
than the VC, comparable Intelligence levels, but a much lower Will ratio
(at least at the upper decision-making levels).  Because of this, our Force
assets were bound under all sorts of bizarre restrictions which hampered
their usefulness, and we ultimately left in defeat.
By disseminating a mechanism for increasing the Cypherpunks Force level
(the Assassination Politics essay) and annoying some IRS agents with a
stinkbomb, Jim Bell increased the government's Will to capture and
incarcerate him.  This is the problem with with terrorism in general (the
OKC bombing is a prime example).
If either Intelligence (the domain of crypto) or Force (the domain of
weapons) is zero, Effectiveness (the real-world ability to inflict damage
or defend yourself from damage) is also zero.  Ignoring either can be

from GunzenBomz Pyro-Technologies, and sign the files indicating that I

with a false key; it would involve either rubber-hosing my passphrase,
changing history on all the Cypherpunks archives (including any on the item
end-user's machine and on the machines of all the Cypherpunks they
correspond with), or re-creating my private key from my public one.  A
similar situation exists for other entities that customarily sign their

Here is a way for an individual to make money using the eternity service:
1:  Users are charged $/MB/month to store data in the service.
2:  Users are charged $/MB for downloading data from the service.
3:  The source of a data item receives a portion of the download fees
collected for that item as an anonymous payment, or else the money could be
applied toward keeping the data on the service (the option of choice for
the really paranoid among us).
The location of the data should be determined by some sort of random
process, and it should move frequently.  Disallowing one to store one's own
data reduces the number possible locations for the data, and also requires
a mechanism for matching the source of the data to the owner of each node-
both of which are Really Bad Karma.
One could also construct a fee schedule where a higher rate would buy a
higher redundancy level for your data.
The eternity service should be its own remailer network--one that transfers
data as well as e-mail.  The nodes should have constant encrypted cover
traffic between them.
