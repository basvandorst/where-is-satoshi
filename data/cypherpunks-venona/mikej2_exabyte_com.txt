You should check the exact text yourself, but the way I read the EAR, you
are not "exporting" strong cryptographic software without a license (exept
to Canada, which needs no license) if you do things "such as"
(1) have the guests to your site acknowledge that the EAR restricts
export, (2) have the guests affirm that they can legally get the software
(proper citizenship or residency & location), and (3) "check the address
of the destination computer to see if it is in the USA" or Canada. The
last one, I interpret rather loosely to mean that if the guest's email
address domain isn't one commonly used in the USA or Canada, then I deny
access. We all know that not all .com addresses are North American, but
chances are really good that if the address ends in .ru, then the
destination machine is probably not in North America. This is not a
perfect way to prevent export, of course, but it is what the regulations
say, as I read them. For a pointer to the regulations and to my access
request form and crypto site, see Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, and most lawyers don't even understand this
stuff, so you read and act on it at your own risk. This is just my best
effort to comply with the law without sacrificing my right to publish.
Is there any reason why people have to look at your warning before reading
your warning? At my site, the ftp site itself is in a hidden directory
that changes names often enough that people can't successfully link to the
restricted files for very long without going through my warning page.
Indeed, my site can't be navigated and indexed properly by web search
robots. At your site, it is extremely likely that someone would find your
software without ever seeing your warning. Indeed, your software is on
another server with another interface. I think that your site counts as
The registration code is legally equivalent to the registered software
that it unlocks. Sending the registration code to France, for example,
would be likely to be considered the same as sending the registered
software to France (in violation of the laws of both countries).
Now if the "unregistered" software is weak (i. e. crippled key length)
without the registration code, you need not worry about posting it
publicly and without restriction, as long as you don't export the
registration code (except to Canada) without a license. I do this with
Quicrypt (ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/qcrypt11.zip).
BTW, I posted krem104.zip at my site. Please let me know if I mangled it
in the process...

If that is the only chink in the armor you see, then you aren't looking
very hard. The point of this system is not to prevent exports, but to (1) comply with the letter of the law by discouraging export in the specified
manner, (2) to comply with the spirit of the law by reducing the number of
exports of cryptographic software from the USA, while (3) making
publication of strong cryptographic software in North America easy and
safe from legal persecution. Without point (3), the national security of
the USA would be harmed, IMHO, by the fact that proportionally more
dishonest people (the ones the NSA and FBI are quict to draw attention to)
than honest ones (the majority of the people who want to use strong
cryptography to protect their privacy and business interests from the
dishonest folks) would use strong cryptography. The only reason I can think of that the U. S. Commander-in-Chief and
President of the United States of America and his staff have determined
that export of strong cryptographic software can harm "national security" even when such software already is available outside of the USA, is that
they are really more concerned about the numbers of people that use such
software regularly, and therefore, they want to limit the total bandwidth
of distribution capacity and ease of retrieval of such software. Export
controls can effectively do both, even if they cannot realistically
prevent export.
Think about it. It was a pain to set up the EAR-compliant site that I set
up compared to a simple site for global distribution, and few people would
go through the hassle. Many major information services and ftp sites
simply disallow strong cryptographic software rather than go through the
hassle. Because of this, it is probably true that fewer people find,
download, and use strong cryptographic software.
Until more people set up more strong cryptographic software distribution
sites and write more good, secure, robust, easy-to-use cryptographic
software such that it is about as easy to find and use it as not to, the
Feds win. Their point is proven. Fewer people use strong cryptography than
would otherwise, and some small (but, to them, significant) percentage of
those people who were discouraged from using strong cryptographic software
might have used that software in a criminal activity. Too bad about the
good guys who could have prevented computer crime or worse with the same
technology, huh?

@_subject: Re: Disseminating public-key crypto source code 
Point 2 is the easier one -- you can research, create, and distribute
patented algorithms for free. It is just in using or selling them that you
need to get a license from the patent holder (directly or indirectly).
Point 1 is a bit muddier, but the new EAR (which replace the ITAR)
actually defines what you need to do to freely distribute cryptographic
software in North America, essentially describing something like MIT's PGP
distribution system and my system at
 (at least as far as is practical):
(ii) The export of encryption source code and object code software
controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control List
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) includes downloading, or
causing the downloading of, such software to locations (including
electronic bulletin boards, Internet file transfer protocol, and World
Wide Web sites) outside the U.S., or making such software available for
transfer outside the United States, over wire, cable, radio,
electromagnetic, photooptical, photoelectric or other comparable
communications facilities accessible to persons outside the United States,
including transfers from electronic bulletin boards, Internet file
transfer protocol and World Wide Web sites, unless the person making the
software available takes precautions adequate to prevent unauthorized
transfer of such code outside the United States. Such precautions shall
(A) Ensuring that the facility from which the software is available
controls the access to and transfers of such software through such
measures as:
(1) The access control system, either through automated means or
human intervention, checks the address of every system requesting or
receiving a transfer and verifies that such systems are located within the
United States;
(2) The access control system, provides every requesting or
receiving party with notice that the transfer includes or would include
cryptographic software subject to export controls under the Export
Administration Act, and that anyone receiving such a transfer cannot
export the software without a license; and
(3) Every party requesting or receiving a transfer of such software
must acknowledge affirmatively that he or she understands that the
cryptographic software is subject to export controls under the Export
Administration Act and that anyone receiving the transfer cannot export
the software without a license; or
(B) Taking other precautions, approved in writing by the Bureau of
Export Administration, to prevent transfer of such software outside the
U.S. without a license.
Point (1) above is done at my site, to something of an approximation, by
using a .htaccess file. I'm working on improving this, some, due to some
server problems, but I think that it is close enough to meet the "such
measures as" criteria, especially since (2) and (3) are met pretty
literally by the mechanism that routinely breaks links that attempt to
bypass the warning page. Of course, this isn't perfect, and no coderpunk
worth his salt would have difficulty bypassing the system if he or she
were inclined to break the law, but it does allow me to post strong
cryptographic software without worrying about breaking the law.
Why don't more people do this? Probably because the law has usually been
even more muddy than the above, and at least as irrational, and because it
is more of a pain than just posting the stuff, which few people want to
flaunt their disregard for the law so publicly.
There is another, better way, to comply with the above using CGI
scripting, but my ISP is reluctant to let me do so, so far.
By the way, there is no automated way to add files to my crypto site,
but if you are interested in posting quality crypto software, libraries,
and documentation (like maybe some DES challenge code or RC5 cracker
code), please email me at mpj
