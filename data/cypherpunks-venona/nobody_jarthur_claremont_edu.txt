I had to make a few patches for pgptools and magic money to compile on
a dos system with microsoft c 6.0.
  do not work with this compiler.  I added  __TURBOC__ around
these includes in mm.c, s.c, c.c, and ptd.c.
In pgpmem.c, this system has malloc.h but not alloc.h.  Change the  MSDOS
to  __TURBOC__.
With these changes it worked.

Consider me a hypocrite BUT.... consider the following...
My AMPS cell phone is easily intercepted... yes I know I
often listen to others calls on my scanner and frequency counter... myself. :)
   As I am one who is being investigated and tapped I often discuss
Totally Fallacious and Unverifiable conspiracies
(protected by crypto you see)... Given also I have had PLENTY
of contact with the OPFOR(opposing force i.e. LE Mind Set)...
I know ANYTHING is believeable to that mind set as long as enough
crumbs(i.e. evidence is found... email seems to be sufficient dor this
at least to start investigating). Make it VERY unprofitable to investigate...
As far as Digital Banks go ... Yes there has always been Cashing your
Check and then buying everything cash. Its INCONVENIENT AS HELL...
Believe me I Live this way...   Having  Anonymous Electronic Credit Cards
issued by the First Cyberspatial BAnk and being either a Visa or MC with NO way transactions tracable to me would be
a BIG convenience...
 Look at the recent Soft porn Bust....(by enrtapment with kiddie porn no less)
The IRS is now getting hit with falacious Electronically Returns/Refunds...
How about filing the next 2-3000 in the name of your favorite Judge,
DA, Investigator, Senator, Representative....All fraudalent returns...
with even the possibility of profit... I figure the resulting shitstorm when
the IRS Revenue Officers and Criminal Section Investigators start on Federal Judges, Representatives and the like will consume MOST of the federal
bureaucracy time....

As one who used to do quite a bit of Detweiller bashing in private...
I have come not to think of him as a problem... but simply
as a relentless evolutionary factor forcing the structure and methodlogy
of remailers to evolve to be more secure, better equipped and
in all a better product then the community had prior to their abuse...
Whether any of us like LD personally or not we ARE evolving our technology to meet his threat... and I am personally glad its happening earlier than Later..
The Puzzle Palace is a FAR more potent adversary... kinda of like the BORG...
Best we evolve the technology as quickly as possible before its outlawed and
it has to be taken underground .... War on DRUGS??? How about the WAR on Forbidden Math?

U.S. Budget:
THE $28-BILLION BLACK HOLE
Within President Clinton's proposed $1.5-trillion 1995 federal
budget lies a mysterious item. It is, according to the Feb. 8 New
York Times, "hidden in false line items and deleted passages in
the Pentagon's accounts." And it has been this way for over 40
We're talking about the annual budget for secret military and
intelligence operations. This $28 billion--which is only an
"approximation"--is set aside for covert military programs and
repressive spy agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency; the
National Reconnaissance Office, which builds spy satellites; and
the National Security Agency, which conducts electronic
A black hole in space is so dense that not even light can escape
from it. This secret budget operates much the same way. Money
goes into it, but what it's spent for never sees the light of
There isn't even Congressional oversight for how the money is
used. In fact, an estimated budget wasn't even published until a
decade ago. As is to be expected, the Clinton administration is
content with this arrangement.
Along with his overt support for covert operations, Clinton has
shown his admiration for the military-industrial complex by
offering the Pentagon $263.7 billion--$3 billion more than last
year. While there is certain to be some wrangling among the
politicians and military brass over which programs should get the
most, overall the Pentagon will once again be awash in money.
But don't think Clinton is showing favoritism only to the
generals. There are also the big bankers. They're getting $212.8
billion in 1995 in the form of interest payments on the national
debt. The capitalist government considers this budget item
legally mandatory.
All told, almost half-a-trillion dollars are going to the banks
and the military!
Think about that when the bosses and politicians tell you there's
no money for jobs, child care and housing.

@_subject: Nuclear Capone in Russia? 
Los Angeles Times, Saturday, Feb. 26, 1994, p.A10
FBI Director Sees Parallels Between Russia Now, Chicago Then
Crime: Louis J. Freeh doesnt want a Slavic Al Capone to endanger U.S.
investments or undermine the fragile democratic process.  And he is
working to help prevent it.
By Ronald J. Ostrow
Times Staff Writer
Washington - To FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, organized crime in Russia
today bears disturbing similarities to Chicagos in the 1920s and
1930s - violent but fractionalized, a danger to itself as much as to
the rest of society, and with a potential for much more.
The likes of Al Capone, unchecked by the FBI or any other law
enforcement body, welded the Chicago mob into a unified force that
preyed on the community for decades.
Freeh does not want a Slavic equivalent of Capone to do the same today
in Russia, for fear not only of endangering American Business activity
there but also of undermining that countrys fragile democratic
process.  And he is working to help Russian authorities prevent it.
Already, Freeh said, elements of Russian organized crime are
responsible for everything from "bushwhacking" American businessmen to
dealing in materials that could be used in nuclear weapons.
If authorities do not act soon, he said, organized crime will become
so entrenched throughout the former Soviet Union and its Eastern
European satellites that, like the Mafia in Chicago, it will take
decades to remove it.
"We have to look at it as something that's clearly directed toward the
United States, toward our economy," Freeh said in an interview.  "Even
with decreasing resources, we can't afford to do what the FBI did with
respect to La Cosa Nostra for 30 years, and that was to completely
ignore it."
The situation in Russia today, Freeh acknowledged, is not as dire as
in Chicago in the 1920s and 1930s.
But German and Russian law enforcement authorities "are concerned
about the very rapid inroads that these gangs are making into
officialdom, into police and government officials," the FBI director
To help the Russians cope, Freeh wants to station up to three FBI
agents in Moscow by the end of spring to serve as liaisons with
Russian authorities.
Contacts are now handled largely by two agents based in Bonn, who have
responsibilities beyond the former Soviet Union.
Authorities in Russia's Interior Ministry and the Moscow police "are
desperately in need of our help," Freeh said.  "They want our
training, our methodology."
He also wants to bring Russian agents for 11 weeks of training at the
FBI's National Academy in Quantico, VA., where they would learn about
laboratory and computer work and the other technologies that the FBI
uses against organized crime.
For now, Freeh said, the victims of Russia's organized crime are
mostly Russian Entrepreneurs and other business people.  But he warned
that American businesses seeking a foothold in Russia are just as
"Part of the [Clinton] Administration's program is to give not only
economic aid but to [assist] economic institution-building and to
encourage American and other foreign investments" in the former Soviet
Union, he said.
"If the scouts for leading American corporations are getting
bushwhacked in their hotel rooms in Moscow or, perhaps worse,
establishing a foothold and having to face extortion and economic
criminal activity they are not prepared to do, our economy takes a
serious hit," Freeh said.  "The end product is that the process for
democracy and a free economy in Russia takes a very significant step
"I guess it's an irony, but it's much harder to police in a democratic
fashion than than to police in a totalitarian fashion," Freeh said. "Police work is very hard if you do it according to due process and
Authorities in the former Soviet Union "don't have that experience and
haven't had it for 70 years.  So they're having to learn all of the
tools, skills and techniques and, at the same time, deal with a
burgeoning crime crisis," Freeh said.
U.S. authorities are particularly concerned that Russian gangs "are
aggressively looking to buy and sell nuclear materials," the FBI
director said.
The materials so far are less than weapons grade, but they could be
used for designing devices deadly to population centers, according to
FBI intelligence.
"That's a whole different threat than we've faced before," Freeh
He declined to give any more specifics on the threat, but said the
United States under the law now lacks authority to fully deal with
Under the 1950 Atomic Energy Act, the FBI has authority to investigate
the transfer or shipment of nuclear materials only if their origin or
destination is American or they have entered and left the United
Freeh said he has discussed with Atty. Gen Janet Reno and other
Justice Department officials the need for a law broadening the FBI's
authority over such matters.
The FBI is also interested in the criminal activities of Russian
immigrants in the United States, according to Jim Moody, who directs
the FBI's efforts against organized crime.
In the late 1970's and early 1980's, about 200,000 people entered the
United States from the Soviet Union, and Moody estimated that about 1%
of them - 2,000 - were "hard-core criminals."
But he regards them as second-string players who are now being
replaced by more highly skilled, educated lawbreakers.
In one of the more sophisticated conspiracies involving Russian
emigres, a federal grand jury in Philadelphia last June charged 15
people and two corporations with evading federal and state excise
taxes on the sale of more than 51 million gallons of diesel fuel in
Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

A continual subject of debate has been the privacy of swiss accounts...
and lichenstein and luxemborg banks...
according to a recent text I read on the subject
the hot way to conduct banking in privacy by mail is to
a. use a canadian PO Box to avoid US mail covers on swiss postmarked incoming mail...
b. if the money is derived honestly(i.e. legitamate but underground businesses
simply underground for tax-avoidance) and NOT drug dealing derived
or from an offence that is also an offense in Switzerland, then
all privacy laws on swiss banks apply...tax avoidance is specifically excluded as an area where US. TLA can obtain cooperation
of swiss authorities.
c. Swiss Banks issue credit cards on accounts... :)
d. further privacy is derived via a trust or corporation in
Lichenstein and transferring the mony to said trust or corp from
a swiss bank...
e. A list of Swiss Banks to start with:
