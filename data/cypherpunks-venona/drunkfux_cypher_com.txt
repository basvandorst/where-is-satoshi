                             ----------------
HoHoCon is the largest annual gathering of those in, related to, or
wishing to know more about the computer underground. Attendees generally
include some of the most notable members of the "hacking" and "telecom"
community, journalists, authors, security professionals, lawyers, and a
host of others. Previous speakers include John Draper (Cap'n Crunch), Ray
Kaplan, Chris Goggans (Erik Bloodaxe), Bruce Sterling, and many more. The
conference is also one of the very few that is completely open to the
public and we encourage anyone who is interested to attend.
                            Hotel Information
                            -----------------
The Austin North Hilton recently split its complex into two seperate
hotels; the Hilton and the newly added Super 8. HoHoCon guests have the
choice of staying in either hotel. Group rates are as followed :

Once again, the hotel has set aside a block of rooms for the conference
and we recommend making your reservations as early as possible to
guarantee a room within the block, if not to just guarantee a room period.
Rooms for the handicapped are available upon request. To make your
reservations, call the the number listed above that corresponds with where
you are and where you want to stay and make sure you tell them you are

                            Conference Details
                            __________________
HoHoCon will last 3 days, with the actual conference being held on
Saturday, December 18 starting at 11:00 a.m. and continuing until 5 p.m.
or earlier depending on the number of speakers. Although a few speakers
have confirmed their attendance, we are still in the planning stages and
will wait until the next update to release a speaking schedule. We welcome
any speaker or topic recommendations you might have (except for, say, "Why
I Luv Baked Potatos On A Stik!"), or, if you would like to speak yourself,
please contact us as soon as possible and let us know who you are, who you
represent (if anyone), the topic you wish to speak on, a rough estimate of
how long you will need, and whether or not you will be needing any
audio-visual aids.
We would like to have people bring interesting items and videos again this
year. If you have anything you think people would enjoy having the chance
to see, please let us know ahead of time, and tell us if you will need any
help getting it to the conference. If all else fails, just bring it to the
con and give it to us when you arrive. Any organization or individual that
wants to bring flyers to distribute during the conference may do so. You
may also send your flyers to us ahead of time if you can not make it to
the conference and we will distribute them for you. Left over flyers are
included with information packets and orders that we send out, so if you
want to send extras, go ahead.
                                   Cost
                                   ----
Unlike smaller, less informative conferences, we do not ask you to shell
out hundreds of dollars just to get in the door, nor do we take your money
and then make you sleep in a tent. We are maintaining the motto of "give
$5 if you can", but due to the incredibly high conference room rate this
year, we may step up to "$5 minimum required donation" or "give us $5 or
we'll smash your head in". Five dollars is an outrageously low price
compared to the suit infested industry conferences or even the new "Cons
are k00l and trendy, I gotta do one too!" conferences that are charging
up to $50 for admission alone.
To encourage people to donate, we will once again be having our wonderless
"Raffle For The Elite" during the conference. We will issue a prize list
in a future update, but we can guarantee that this year there will be a
lot more (and better) prizes than last year, including a full system (and,
no, it's not a c64 or 286). Anyone who wishes to donate worthwhile items
to the raffle, please let us know ahead of time, or if it's a last minute
aquirement, just bring it to the conference.
                           Miscellaneous Notes
                           -------------------
To save myself some time by mailing responses to a lot of the same
questions I expect to get, I'll answer a few of them here.
Although I have not talked to him myself yet, Steve Ryan has told me that
Bruce Sterling will indeed be in attendance and may say a few words.
As far as I know, there will not be any visitors from any other planets
at the conference. Scot Chasin is still on Earth and will be making an
Video cameras will *not* be allowed inside the conference room without
prior consent due to previous agreements made with speakers who do not
wish for certain parts of their speech to be rebroadcast. Still cameras
and Etch-A-Sketch's are fine and tape recorders are too easily hidden
for us to be able to control.
Videos and T-Shirts from last year's conference are still available, and
will also be on hand during the conference. We do not handle the LoD World
Tour shirts, but I can tell you that that the old ones are gone and a
*new* LoD shirt will be unveiled at the conference. The HoHoCon shirts are
$15 plus $3 shipping ($4.00 for two shirts). At this time, they only come
in extra large. We may add additional sizes if there is a demand for them.
The front of the shirt has the following in a white strip across the
                               I LOVE FEDS
      (Where LOVE = a red heart, very similar to the I LOVE NY logo)
                          And this on the back:
                            dFx & cDc Present
                               HOHOCON '92
                              December 18-20
                              Allen Park Inn
                              Houston, Texas
   There is another version of the shirt available with the following:
                               I LOVE WAREZ
The video includes footage from all three days, is six hours long and
costs $18 plus $3 shipping ($4.00 if purchasing another item also). Please
note that if you are purchasing multiple items, you only need to pay one
shipping charge of $4.00, not a charge for each item. If you wish to send
an order in now, make all checks or money orders payable to O.I.S.,
include your phone number and mail it to the street address listed below.
Allow a few weeks for arrival.
There will be new HoHoCon '93 shirts available at the conference and a
video of the festivities will be out early next year.

                              --------------

wants to RSVP, wants to order anything, or would like to be added to the

                                77008-4106
We also have a VMB which includes all the conference information and is
probably the fastest way to get updated reports. The number is:
                               713-867-9544
You can download any of the conference announcements and related
materials by calling Metalland Southwest at 713-468-5802, which is the
offical HoHoCon BBS. The board is up 24 hours a day and all baud rates
are supported.
Those of you with net access can ftp to cypher.com and find all the
HoHoCon information available in /pub/hohocon. The .gifs from previous
cons are *not* currently online.
Conference information and updates will most likely also be found in most
computer underground related publications and mailing lists, including
CuD, CSP, Mondo 2000, 2600, Phrack, TUC, phn0rd, cypherpunks, etc. They
should also appear in a number of newsgroups including comp.dcom.telecom,
alt.security, comp.org.eff.talk, and sci.crypt. We completely encourage
people to use, reprint, and distribute any information in this file.
     Same stupid ending statement from last year to make us look good
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
HoHoCon '93 will be a priceless learning experience for professionals and
gives journalists a chance to gather information and ideas direct from the
source. It is also one of the very few times when all the members of the
computer underground can come together for a realistic purpose. We urge
people not to miss out on an event of this caliber, which doesn't happen
very often. If you've ever wanted to meet some of the most famous people
from the hacking community, this may be your one and only chance. Don't
wait to read about it in all the magazines and then wish you had been
there, make your plans to attend now! Be a part of what we hope to be our
largest and greatest conference ever.

John Draper has already expressed an interest in having everyone   exchange keys, and will probably mention this during his speech.
  I can guarantee there will be numerous laptops, and even full   systems avaialable. Last year, we even had 4-machine internet    site going - hohocon.com. Yeah, it was great for about 5 minutes
  until all the power in the wing went out.

may also send your flyers to us ahead of time if you can not make it to
the conference and we will distribute them for you. Left over flyers are
included with information packets and orders that we send out, so if you
want to send extras, go ahead.
                                   Cost
                                   ----
Unlike smaller, less informative conferences, we do not ask you to shell
out hundreds of dollars just to get in the door, nor do we take your money
and then make you sleep in a tent. We are maintaining the motto of "give
$5 if you can", but due to the incredibly high conference room rate this
year, we may step up to "$5 minimum required donation" or "give us $5 or
we'll smash your head in". Five dollars is an outrageously low price
compared to the suit infested industry conferences or even the new "Cons
are k00l and trendy, I gotta do one too!" conferences that are charging
up to $50 for admission alone.
To encourage people to donate, we will once again be having our wonderless
"Raffle For The Elite" during the conference.                             Miscellaneous Notes
                           -------------------
Video cameras will *NOT* be allowed inside the conference room, except
for the people who have received prior consent to film. Still photos are fine as each speaker will announce whether he or she minds them
being taken.
The minimum required donation is $5. This basically means that there is
a definite cover charge this year. Everyone who attends will receive one
raffle ticket with more available for an additional cost. Anyone who whines about the door cost will be severly beaten with a bat.
Raffle prizes include two computer systems (one is a brand new Packard
Bell 486 and the other is a complete package with monitor and printer),
one flip phone and one brick phone, an autographed copy of Guy Kawasaki's "Computer Curmudgeon", "Terminal Compromise" by Winn Schwartau, 6 tapes
(36 hours) of poorly edited cheesy hotel porn, an autographed 'Dazed &
Confused' velvet black-light poster, subscriptions to major and not so
major computer/telecommunications magazines, assorted t-shirts and videos, and numerous other items including those we don't know of yet.
Although nobody will ever believe this until they see it, one of the major prizes this year is a 4x4 Jeep used by Brandon and Brenda Walsh
(Jason Priestly and Shannen Dougherty) of Beverly Hills 90210. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we are giving away a BRAND NEW CAR.
The starting time of the conference has changed from 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.  Keep this in mind when pondering whether or not to down yet
another bottle of Wild Turkey or Mad Dog 20/20 on Friday night.
HoHoCon '93 shirts, as well as last year's video and a new version of the
I Love Feds shirt, will be available during the conference. The shirts
are $15 and the video is $20. We have also added XXL for all you big folks. If you are unable to attend the conference and wish to obtain any of these items, you may either mail us for more information or send a check or money order payable to O.I.S. to the address listed
below. Include $3 per order (not per item) for shipping.
For those who have been asking, I do not expect it to be too cold
during the conference. The weather has been fairly nice as of late.
Due to a major hard disk crash, Metalland Southwest (the HoHoCon BBS) is
down until further notice. Please mail us if you would like information
There will be a small, all female S&M/Bondage presentation on Saturday
night in one of the hospitality suites. Please bring numerous one dollar bills. Also, keep this in mind when considering purchasing the HoHoCon 93
Peter Shipley and John Draper have expressed interest in exchanging PGP
keys with other attendess this year. If you wish to partake in this activity, bring your key along with you, preferably on a IBM/MS-DOS floppy. Those of you driving from Houston that wish to join to HoHoConvoy which
leaves for Austin on Friday morning should call the HoHoCon VMB and leave a message with a contact number.
By attending the conference, you are consenting to being filmed and
photographed and having your ugly likeness used in any fashion I deem
The HoHoCon sluggo mail address has changed slightly. Due to mail
constantly being delivered to the wrong box or being returned because slight addressing mistakes, the box number has been removed and an attention line added. If you have had problems mailing us recently,
try again with the new address listed below.

Those of you with net access can ftp to cypher.com and find all the

cons are *not* currently online.
     Same stupid ending statement from last year to make us look good
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
HoHoCon '93 will be a priceless learning experience for professionals and
gives journalists a chance to gather information and ideas direct from the
source. It is also one of the very few times when all the members of the
computer underground can come together for a realistic purpose. We urge
people not to miss out on an event of this caliber, which doesn't happen
very often. If you've ever wanted to meet some of the most famous people
from the hacking community, this may be your one and only chance. Don't
wait to read about it in all the magazines and then wish you had been
there, make your plans to attend now! Be a part of what we hope to be our
largest and greatest conference ever.
