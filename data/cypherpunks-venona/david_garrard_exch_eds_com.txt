@_subject: Recovery of Windows NT administrator password 
An inherited Windows NT system that I am involved with has a lost administrator password ( no one no longer knows what it is ). Can anyone point me to software products/companies that can help in the recovery. Given Microsoft's dismal record on  security I am sure there must be solutions to this dilemma. Any help would be greatly Best Regards
