Any particular reason why this statement lost that person's

Another basic problem that I'm surprised hasn't come up yet:
If I have a 1-bit flit with full revision history, don't I have to
have revision history on each of the bits of the revision history of
the original flit?  We're talking an infinite amount of storage space
here, for one flit that has been moved once!  Also, revisions for the
individual bits in program, including the programs to keep track of
flits, including revision history of programs in main memory, from
what it sounds like.
We will never have this much storage space.  An infinite amount is
required.  What would be the point anyways?  Makes a lot more sense on
a per-file basis.

Sorry, I've just recieved so much complete incompetence with this
issue that talking to someone who was on the ball took some
adjusting.  Hope I wasn't too rude.
One of the main issue on cypherpunks right now (Black Unicorn did a
sort of "white paper" on it recently, as in two days ago) is
integrating cryptography with other apps, in particular WWW apps.  It
just seemed to me that if the kind of exstensibility which Emacs is
famous for was going to be a part of GROW, which apparently was the
attention, this would be a Good Thing for cryptography integration.  I
good point in this direction is that the most popular way of using PGP
with email is emacs-based (i.e. more people sign their posts to
cypherpunks using Mailcrypt, the emacs-PGP interface, then all other
signers combined, so it must be pretty easy to use).  I've used it,
and it's incredibly slick.  I had hopes the GROW to go as far as emacs
but with more network awareness.  Oh well.
This has been crossposted to cypherpunks, BTW.
PS: You may want to go through and terf ALL the grow pages, not just
some of them.

This is the way I have heard it stated, and it is _WAY_ too long since
I have studied Latin.  One of my great dissapointments is that,
despite having spent my entire school career (less university: I'm

year of latin, after which the course was dropped.  Sigh.

In a libertarian society, so-called "public decorum" is dictated by
who owns the property you are sitting on.  If my building code
(i.e. the code of laws set by the person who owns the building I live
in) says I can blast my boombox, your opinion can go to hell: find
another place to live if you don't like it.  Or petition the person
who owns the place.
Burning toxic waste is intrisically damaging to other people,
blasting your boombox is not (unless it is so loud as to actually
cause ear damage to bystanders, but given the volume of music
tolerated at rock concerts, I find this highly unlikely).

In Ontario, they tried this on some of the major highways.  The most
interesting thing about it was that it was proved time and time again
that the technology was not up to snuff: there was an almost 0% chance
of being caught.  When the license plate wasn't obscured or unreadable
(which it usually was) the computerized mailing system made some
stupid mistake that allowed the person to get off if they challenged

reasons when the next government came in, but studies showed that it
_succeeded_ in lowering peoples speed limits.  I personally drove
consistantly about 20-40km over the speed limit while this was in
