@_subject: SURVEY: Encryption in Commercial Enterprises 
Dear Receiver,
I am completing a brief survey of encryption technologies and the uses of
this technology in commercial enterprises. I have included three questions
below. After reviewing these short questions, I would appreciate greatly, if
you could provide your input (your responses) to me. My email address is
mjsus - thanks in advance.
Best regards,
1. In your opinion, what are the 5-10 most significant applications of
encryption technologies currently in commercial enterprises?
2. In your opinion, what are 5-10  main barriers currently that may prevent
the successful implementation and utilization of encryption technologies in
commercial enterprises?
3. What are activities and projects that can be initiated and taken to lower
and reduce above barriers (see the question 2.)?
