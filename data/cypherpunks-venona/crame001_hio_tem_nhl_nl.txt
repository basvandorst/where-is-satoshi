@_subject: Who did win??? 
I read a message that the 'american' had won the 'RSA war'. I think the loose.
Because we can still send private messages to the states with PGP 2.3a but
they can't sent private messages out of the states...
So, really? Who did win???

@_subject: Why PGP 2.5 sucks... 
PGP 2.5 really sucks...
 - You can't use your old secret key. So you have to build a new one.
   Why? I don't know. But PGP 2.5 don't recognize your pass phrase anymore.
   Maybe that new RSA algoritme is easier to crack. So they force everybody
   to create a new key...
 - A new RSA algorithm??? What's wrong with the old one???
 - Why not bigger keys than 1024 bits???
 - Why can't PGP 2.3a read PGP 2.6 messages anymore after 1 september 1994?
The only good thing about 2.5 is that it's legal in de USA and Canada? But
why doesn't someone gets a license for PGP 2.3a so that's a legal version
too! (or is that inpossible???)

And it is superior indeed... But what are we talking about here. A 1024 bits
key should be save for at least the next 10000 years so who cares if a 5000
bits key could be save for maybe a 1000000 years!!! If the big keys are going to be used PGP will be taken away from user that
not can use very fast machines... ... If you outlaw Privacy, only Outlaws will have Privacy!

@_subject: Announcement: PGS v0.99c 
PGS v0.99c is out there!
This new version of PGS supports 8 bytes keyid's. This version will be able to run in a OS/2 DOS box.
PGS v0.99c is available on the following site:
I hope that at the end of next week PGS v0.99c will be available
at SimTel too...
Do not throw away 0.99b yet because we did the bugfix a bit fast because
we want to have it ready before the hollidays...

@_subject: Announcement: PGS v0.99d 
Ok, I know that v0.99c was just released a week ago... But hey,
We had some spare time before our hollidays so we fixed some stuff
and here is the result: PGS v0.99d.
This version will be able to read the keysize of all keys. And gives a
nice statement in the information window that we CAN'T build the fingerprint
of keys that have been generated using a non-default exponent size. So,
no trash fingerprints anymore I hope...
Because v0.99c was just released a week ago I kept the 099c.new file in
the archive so you can still check out what's new there...
PGS v0.99d can be found right now at:
wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4):/pub/msdos_uploads/pgs/pgs099d.zip
And at the beginning of next week at:
oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117):/SimTel/security/pgs099d.zip

@_subject: Ann: PGS v0.99e 
Just another release of Pretty Good PGP Shell:
PGS v0.99e is the bug fix for the public beta version of PGS v0.99d.
PGS is a very good shell for PGP. PGS has an advanced keyring management
system and reads keyring it selves!!! PGS is very easy to use!
PGS supports PGP versions 2.3a 2.6MIT 2.6ui.
And ViaCrypt PGP versions 2.4 and 2.7.
Special requirements: 80286 or up.
Changes: A few minor bugs where fixed. The major memory leak in the key
information section has been fixed. Because some users did have some
problem with PGS changing the color pallet a new color mode has build in
that uses standard (STD) colors. It is now possible to save the color
mode (PGS, STD (default) or MONO) in the configuration file.
PGS v0.99e is available for download at the following sites:
(Right now)
 wuarchive.wustl.edu:/pub/msdos_uploads/pgs/pgs099ee.zip
 128.252.135.4:/pub/msdos_uploads/pgs/pgs099ee.zip
