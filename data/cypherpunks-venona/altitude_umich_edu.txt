So, does anyone know for certain if this is the true letter of the law?
Since RC4 has been reverse engineered (or leaked) to the public, do they
have any claim on it if there is no patent?  Seeing the legal web that
surrounds a lot of the current crypto situation in the US, it's not
surprising that RSA would try to smoke screen everyone into thinking that
there would be a clear violation (prosecutable by law) if anyone used RC4
without getting a license.  (It's also not surprising that no one's tried
as well...)
