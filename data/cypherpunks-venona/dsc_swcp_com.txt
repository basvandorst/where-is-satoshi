Thanks for the advice.  Here are the two missing pieces.
The first is financial, but might be really psychological.  I buy PPP
service locally and it is hard for me to casually browse with the meter
runing in the corner of the screen even at less than a penny a minute.
(And any document that mentions David Friedman probably needs study and
that takes more time.)
The second is that even at the wee hours of the morning I kept getting
refusals from  and I couldn't get past the table of
contents.  I had hoped to collect these as I browse 'em to avoid delays
(14.4), hicups and online time in later reading.  (I didn't even try the
large html--I suspect my browsers will gag on it.)
The third of the two reasons is some vague notion of taking it to lunch or
of anotating the file or the hard copy.
In case it wasn't clear--I couldn't get a peep out of netcom.
My plan is to try oberlin again and if that bogs down, try getting the copy
at the location mentioned by Lou Poppler--or any other location mentioned
this weekend.  Or respond to advice on the best times to try netcom.
I appologize for the implicit assumption in my question about alternate

For example, the money exchanger or bank can allow an exchange option that

by Timothy and Monty this just pushes the question down to whether anyone
can trust the bank.  Timothy claims evidence that there will be entities
such as banks that do not scam customers.
I observe that from a few trusted entities a great amount of trust can be
created--bubbling up that same recursion.  In the above example, the trust
of the Anonymous Escrow Agency is increased by the mechanism that does not
allow the agency to get at the cash.  This uses the trust of the bank, but
does not decrease the trust of the bank.

everybody can become almost as trustworthy as the most trustworthy entity

Somebody passed this along:
This is a good idea.  And maybe cryptography can get involved--see below.
As a parent it is my responsibility to control what comes into the house
and to determine what limited view of the net my kids see.  The screening
software to do this could be in my home or part of a service of my service
A few companies have some simple products for doing this.  Most are
discouraged by threats from congress to reduce the market need.  Most
products use a simple red list to block access according to literature sent
me.  Some look for key words.
Normally, I would say that it is very premature for standards work.  It
would be good to see more ideas tried.  The Exon threats probably do not
allow this, so I see this news as a good thing.
One place to start is the web.
Depending on the kid's age and other factors I would want to have different
limitations on what the kid sees.  Older kids might just get warnings.  I
would like--for the little ones--to limit the view to some combination of
sites listed on green lists.  The view for slightly older kids might use
red lists to exclude sites instead.  (I really would want to create some
logical combination of lists for each kid.)  Organizations can compete for
the list market.  I might use these in what ever combination I like and
also add my own.  It is important to note that the kinds of things I would
like to screen out or in might be different from what the next person would
like to screen out or in.  (I put little faith in content screening.)
The problem might be in getting huge lists every week.  And pages that
seemed fine once could have changed.  Current red list subscriptions are
expensive--it is easier to keep kids off the computer.
As an alternative to green lists consumer organizations and do-gooder
organizations might certify pages.  These might be virtual green lists.
Each web page would have the cert built in--perhaps in comments to allow
most viewers to work.  Instead of checking a list in this case, the
screening software would ask the page to verify itself.
If the cert was PGP based, then every home doing this would have to have
PGP.  The screening product could use PGP.  Perhaps PGP would be slow.
There might be some way to check signatures that is faster and does not
have patent limitations.  It would be nice if it was possible for the
browser to see the first screenful without waiting for the screener to see
the entire page.
Only those that especially want to make their sites available to kids of
picky parents would get the pages certified.  Maybe just sending in e$3
would do it.  Or e$50 to get to the head of the list.
In whatever standards that come about, it is important that only those
involved in the screening process pay the price ($, delays).  Everybody
else should be able to carry on.
I do worry that some quick standards would be put into place and that
innovation in this area would then become arrested.

     Should a market monopoly survive some form of

     people have needs for varying levels and varying
     specializations so that several kinds of

     by multiple entities.
     I suspect that many people would want a

We seem to be having problems with the meanings of words.  For example, I
make a distinction between certification and licensing.  Also, I see
violence and coercion as being ultimately related to something physical.
I'm not sure what "proper", "competent to practice"... mean.  And I see a
big difference in a market based monopoly and a government based monopoly.
I had assumed you meant by authority an agent of the state that is able to
envoke or otherwise wield the physical force of the state.  By a certifying
entities I was refering to private organizations that had no similar power
or to government organizations that had only the power to provide
By a licensing entity I was refering to an organization that can coerce to
prevent the unlicensed from doing the licensed behavior.  By coercion I
meant the threat of physical force or the force itself.  Though one might
think of physical force as applying to murder, kidnapping, slavery,
assault, robbery, physical theft, I would also apply it to theft or damage
of abstract property that has properties like physical property.  I intend
for these to apply to many actions of the state.
Perhaps I erred in applying "certification" and "license" to these
contrasting concepts, but I do think the distinction is important and the
observation that there are fuzzy areas in between does not remove that.
If I have a license from the local gang to sell drugs and the guy across
the street does not, I could encourage the gang to do something and the guy
might get shot.  Similarly, if I was a PE and my competitor across the
street was not, I could encourage the state to do something that--with
several stages of his lack of cooperation--results in his finding a gun in
his face or worse.
It does not matter why people would trust a certifying entity.  It might
have a great earned reputation, it might "borrow" some reputation from
bonding or audits, or it might have ties to the Real World.
It seems I am using coercion in a different sense.  Unless blacklisting has
physical force at its root enforcement mechanism it is not coercion and is
very fragile.
No.  I apologize for any confusion.
In general, No.  Under many conditions market forces make services alike,
but more often competing businesses find particular market niches.  I would
expect that different certs would cover different levels of expertise,
different specializations and different breadths of specializations.  Any
lawyer might have a dozen certs.  I would not expect there to be a single
level of certification for all applications.  I know of several companies
in which the primary product designer has no engineering degree.
I don't insist there has to be a variety.  I only desire that coercion does
not come into play in preventing it.  As I said, if a natural monopoly
forms at times, I am not worried.
I see a big difference in withholding a signature and sending gunmen.
There is no violence in withholding a signature.
Even if no one else is interested, I'd like to see it.
Yes, the government vs. market question is key, but I believe the answer is
in that distinction I used in contrasting terms "certification" and
"license".  The "who" is tied up in what the instrument is.
The meaning of "qualified professional" and "credentials" will be
market-based and multidimensional, not defined by the state or a group
already "qualified" using the state for enforcement.
Concerning a market-based monopoly,
I don't really think this is a problem.  It is the force-based monopoly and
specifically the government-based monopoly I have a problem with.
The market advantage is slight.
Not required.
What ever the word used, I see the distinction between 1) the assertion of
certain information and 2) the threat of force as being key.
Perhaps, I could have use the phrases "non-coercion-based" licensing and
"coercion-based" licensing, but I am not comfortable with these--trade
licensing invokes too violent of an image.
A note to all in government licensed trades:  I recognize that licensing is
part of the real world we live in.  Often one has to be licensed to
practice a favorite trade.  I do not mean to describe the licensed
themselves as violent.

Not as you describe it.  No.
This is our standoff.
Actually, I think that much coercion (as I used it) is outside the state.
I also believe there is much evil outside of coercion but that is probably
outside the scope of the topic.  I do admit that I am emphasizing coercion
and using that as the dividing line more than other types of evil.
I refered to the physical force used by gangs to enforce neighborhood
rules.  After pondering this, I think this does not apply to my approach.
The state is brought up because it is the agent of coercion in licensing.
The first is not.  The Clipper program (as I understand it) is.  Remember,
my guideline is simple threat of physical harm.
I'll look for Nozick.
I think such a certification is consistent with my desire for alack of
physical coercion in this.  I assume you'd be willing to let the market
prove this point.
I think there is a big difference between "I'm going to break your house
windows unless you give me $50" and "I'm going to stop delivering milk
unless you pay your $50 milk bill".
No.  And for me there are cases when it would be wrong.  I won't comment on
when it is wrong for others, but in the alternate case that includes
violence or the threat, I will say it is wrong.
A BA and BS have become practically the same, but a BSET (tech) is very

Oh. You are right in the last part.  The distinction is NOT the effect.
Not the emotional effect either.  It is the ethics and pragmatics of
relying of a competition of ideas and not force.  To put it bluntly,

I would expect that services might emerge that would strengthen this
without the bank getting involved and without loss of anonymity.
It might emerge that because of the bank's lack of handling of double
spending that in some transactions some payees would request a money order
from a trustee.  The payee might supply the list of money order suppliers
allowed for that day.  If the payee does not want the money order addressed
with a public key, he can supply a set of alternate keys each encrypted for
an acceptable trustee.  The money order allows the payee to be as sure that
the cash is good as he trusts the trustee (and the bank).
With or without the use of a remailer this can add to hiding the payer.
However, unless the payee provides a hidden key, the trustee does know who
received some payment.  The trustee is highly motivated to operate a
memoryless system (except for the trustee's own cash) and might be audited
to ensure this to both customers and potential physical raiders.
The cash bundled in the money order need not be that returned from
exchanging the money order payment.  Some trustees might return a money
order containing cash that has other properties, too.
If the payee really trusts the trustee, then no race to exchange the cash
is needed--hiding the payee further.  The payee can exchange it over a
period of time or as needed.  Exchange includes indirect exchange as in
buying money orders.
I'm new to protocols and I mention details below only to add hopefully
clarifying material, not to suggest that I have any idea of the right ways
to do these things.  These can be implemented using PGP.
Money Order:
The automated trustee checks the money (for money order amount and fee).
If it is bad the trustee sends it back.  Otherwise, the trustee exchanges
the cash and then selects from cash on hand cash of the amount of the money
order.  This is encrypted for the payee.  (The buyer must supply something
the trustee would know how to use to encrypt for the payee: public key or
message addressed to the trustee containing information on how to encrypt
for the payee.)  The money is encrypted with that.  A description is added
to this and it is signed by the trustee and sent back to the payer.  The
description may or may not mention the payee depending on whether the money
was wraped with a public key or not.
Escrowed Money Order:
The trustee creates a money order that can be opened by either the payer or
payee and encrypts that for the escrow agent.  A description and signature
is added.
Payees and escrow agents can be abstract recipients such as and/or lists.
I wonder how much I could charge for this.

@_subject: (Noise) X-Files anarchist 
I hardly watch TV ...blah, blah..., but I saw X-files last night.  A very
minor character was a cryptohacker who--to his surprise--brute-forced a
military key for some files.  He was described as an anarchist.
To _my_ surprise, this anarchist was not associated with violence or
lunatic ravings.  He was shown as reading a book entitled something like
Survey of Modern Conspiracy Theories.  I see this as an improvement in the
stereotype of computer-associated anarchists.  And this I see as a good
thing, since I think there is a lot that could be learned from anarchists.
I think the character was killed, but I may have missed something.
