@_subject: Proposal for anon chaining 
Recent traffic on anonymous remailers/servers:
Here's an idea I haven't seen suggested before, which would remove the need
for a pseudonym server:
The way things stand now, chaining Cypherpunk remailers works by nesting PGP
encryptions of the form
message text
If you want to chain remailers, you encrypt the above, make IT the new message text, and then add another header, and so on until you get bored. My proposal is for a modification of this protocol to allow for pseudonymous return mail addresses, like this:
The trick would be to separate the message text from the remailer routing information, in a message of the form
ROUTING INFORMATION
MESSAGE TEXT
where both blocks are encrypted with PGP. The message text would be encrypted with the PGP public key of the intended final recipient of the message, and would not be modified by the intermediate anon remailers. The routing information would be for the benefit of the remailers only. It would be created by the RECIPIENT and made publicly available as a pseudonymous mail address. It would work like this:
Suppose user foo wishes to establish a pseudonymous identity, and wants to route it through anon remailers "anon1" and "anon2". What he does is take a message of the form
Request-Remailing-To: foo
and encrypts it with server anon1's PGP public key, to create .  Then he adds another header to make
Request-Remailing-To: anon1
and encrypts THIS with anon2's public key to make , and adds a header to make
Request-Remailing-To: anon2
Obviously, this procedure can be nested to arbitrary depth, chaining through as many anon servers as you like. The trick is that this address block can be made PUBLIC, since the only way to unwind the routing is to have access to the secret keys of all the intermediate anon servers, and the identity of the recipient is protected. foo then anonymously posts a PGP public key and a routing block to some public forum,
and people can communicate with him without having any idea as to his actual identity.  When I want to send a message to him, I encrypt the message with his provided public key, and then add the encrypted routing header, which he has also provided.  I give him my own pseudonymous mail routing header to allow him to reply.
This seems to me to be a very robust pseudonymous mail system which could be implemented by relatively minor changes to the existing Cypherpunk remailer structure. It has the additional advantage of being decentralized and maintenance-free.  It could be used for pseudonyms on net news, e-mail, wherever, and could presumably be integrated in some way into Julf's anon server.

I write:
No, evidently I wasn't reading carefully enough. These do appear
to be the same. Although I would suggest making the raw data available to those who
wish to bypass the nym server for some reason. Say, a "Request-Routing-Header ", command. Although I imagine
you guys have your hands full getting even a basically functional
version up.

@_subject: Random Numbers 
There's was some traffic on sci.crypt today about generating random numbers by reading noise off a sound port, which ties in to discussion
here of using a Zener diode device. The question is, if you have a noise source that is likely to create, say, long strings of zeros or
to have some other statistical bias, how do you fix it up to create
a good distribution?  Certainly, if your only problem is that you have an input stream where
the ones are randomly distributed but _rare_, in the sense that the
stream is mostly zeros, you can just count ones for a period of time
and create an output stream like
output[i] = 1 if the parity of N input bits is odd
            0 if the parity of N input bits is even
Then the ouput stream will be very high-entropy.
Something similar, but more complicated, would probably apply to reading
thermal noise as well, since you know the input has a Boltzmann distribution or whatever, and can transform it to a distribution of
your choice. The problem seems to boil down to having random input
with a distribution f() and transforming it to random output with
another distribuion g(). Or if you want to make it worse, having
some not-really-random input f() and transforming it to random output
But this is probably naive -- what are the pitfalls here? What is the
best way to do it for cryptographic purposes?                               -- Will

Nah. You ain't alone. Why shouldn't Bidzos allow NIST a license? Seems
perfectly reasonable to me. Bidzos appears to see this as unrelated to any
larger policy question involving Clipper, and I agree.

@_subject: PGP Bug? 
Cypherpunks --
Looking at the code for doing conventional encryption in PGP, I've come across something that doesn't look right. It's with the 10-byte header block that PGP adds to the beginning of files -- 8 bytes of random data with the last two bytes repeated to use for key verification.
Indicating omissions by "[...]", the code in crypto.c looks like this:
int idea_encryptfile(char *infile, char *outfile, [... a call to GetHashedPassPhrase to set the key]
static int squish_and_idea_file(byte *ideakey, FILE *f, FILE *g, int idea_file(byte *ideakey, boolean decryp, FILE *f, FILE *g, word32 lenfile)
{	
 RAND_PREFIX_LENGTH 8
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
But ideakey is only a sixteen byte buffer! Looks like we're copying junk from the stack here, instead of generating a strong random number to put in the And now a question for the crypto gurus out there. The reason I came across the above is because I'm adding conventional encryption to some Mac code I had laying around, and I wanted to support PGP-format files. I had been thinking about the problem of verifying decryption keys, and the solution I had come up with to use in my code was to MD5 hash the plaintext when I encrypted it, then encrypt the hash with the same key and store it in a resource to use as a key verification block. When the file is decrypted, so is the verification block, and all you have to do to verify the key is MD5 the plaintext again and compare the new hash to the original hash. My question is, can anyone think of any weaknesses with doing it that way? (I can still support PGP data formats if I                                   -- Will

Add my name to the list of supporters of HR 3627.
The truly appealing thing about cryptography is that it places enforcement of the Fourth Amendment completely in the hands of citizens, regardless of the wishes of a sometimes hostile government. We should be exporting the Fourth Amendment far and wide. I wish technology could accomplish that for all ten in the Bill of Rights.
