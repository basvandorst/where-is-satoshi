For almost two years, I was a Tech Support Rep (ooooooo! Evil
Incarnate!) for a software company. It was my experience that, of all the
customers I dealt with, women tended to be less "clued in" about
computers. However, I also found that they were easier to work with, and
didn't require as much "diplomacy" as the male customers I dealt with.
Mind you, this is my experience -- your mileage may vary.
     The whole point here is that, as a whole, women do tend to be less
informed about technology (or at least computers.). Technology is
generally seen, by society, as a "male thing". This trend is changing, but
it is still in force.

Actually, United States law has something "Conspiracy". That's where
you talk about committing a crime. There are certain limitations to it,
but essentially, idly chatting about killing someone might be construed as
a Conspiracy to do it. Therefore, yes, you _can_ go to jail for _talking_
about murder.

My (non-professional) understanding is that conspiracy just requires
intent to commit a crime. Two people sitting around a table, throwing
around hypothetics is no big deal. Two people, sitting around a table,
making plans, OTOH, is.

I would suggest getting a random number between 0 and 1440. This will
allow messages to be sent out every minute. Of course, you could just make
it once every 15 minutes (0-360) or every half hour (0-180). The idea is
that there could be a rather large delay introduced to the process, and
might make the remailer unpopular as a result. Mind you, I appreciate the
effort and generosity. I'm just making suggestions. :-)

Well, it comes from the book Stranger In A Strange Land. It's a
martian word that implies an understanding of something. The main
character was right when he said that there is no human word for it.
     At the risk of starting a whole philosophical debate, here goes the
longer version:
     When you Grok something, you understand its purpose and existance
instinctually, spiritually, and intellectually. It's not something you can
explain concretely, it's just something who's concept is so thoroughly
understandable as to be outside the realms of that which is explanable. A
good example is this: A child groks that his parents will take care of
him, and that they will protect him and keep him safe.  He couldn't
explain to you why he feels that way. He just groks the meaning of the
relationship. That, IMHO, is GROK. It's an understanding that lies so
deeply within you that it is inseperable from your state of being.

     Ah, the "Deep Throat" Theory... I was waiting to see how long this
would take the surface. I agree. Something _very_ unsavory is happening
here, but I doubt we'll find out what it is. If I had to guess (and this
is VERY uninformed, as far as wild speculation), someone in the NSA with
the Power To Do So, said that they would blatantly ignore the rules, and
consider all crypto their private little hunting grounds. Being as the NSA
probably is used in some Intelligence work, and lots of other things the
Government Hopes We Don't Find Out About, Congress probably ran the other
way, as it was in Their Best Interests.
     Of course, this is wild speculation. It could just be that the

want to lose the saturday afternoon Matzah Ball 'Fests... ;-)

Not just IMHO... They are tracking individual phone movement. I know
this for fact. What happens is this: When you are out driving, your phone
is constantly checking the local zone for strength. When the strength goes
down, or signal quality is too low, it scans for a new zone. Then it "logs
in" to the new zone while "logging out" of the old zone.
     Big cities, like LA, have ALOT of zones, none of which are all that
big. By knowing which zone one is in, one is leaving, and one is entering,
it is very easy to determine where someone is, especially if that zone
tracks along a major highway. Then, it's just a matter of time until he's

Your cellphone number is attached to the ESN.      Well, I don't know about the need to let them know. I do know that

I am of the opinion that most of the Post SU countries will amount to
no serious threat. Remember, most of our problem was with Moscow. Most of
the SU didn't especially care about us -- they were more concerned with
eating dinner that night. As a result, yes, there are a few emerging hot
spots, but they aren't _our_ enemies. The Bosnia deal is a local political
problem. It is _not_ a threat to US security, much as Clinton would like
us to think it is... ;-)
     True, but, most of that died. Yugoslavia, for example, is hardly a
threat to us. Our problems in the past were mostly with Moscow. Most of
the rest of the SU was not an issue. So yes, we have more governments to
watch, but fewer enemies.
     Yes, they have Nukes. If I did, in their shoes, you're damn right I
wouldn't want to give them up! Yes, they bear watching. Hell, even Israel,
our military ally, bears watching. That doesn't mean they require the same
level of surveillance.
     NK is a hot spot at the moment. Even if the C/W was still in effect
and the SU still in force, NK would probably still be a problem now. The
Middle Eastern area still requires a mind-boggling amount of watching.
That situation is just too volatile not to watch it. However, I find it
hard to buy into the fact that we're going to give 100% to Middle East,
and the same 100% to Russia, who not only still can't feed it's people,
but has SERIOUS financial problems.                                              --Jeff

If this is a reference to the TEMPEST attack, yes, they can. From
what I hear, it's trivially easy for them to do, because they have The
Right Equipment. Rumor also suggests that that The Right Equipment isn't
so difficult to come by. I don't pretend to understand the intricacies of
TEMPEST, but I do know that the government requires all of their computers
(used at any level of security above none) to be TEMPEST shielded. This
tells us its a real concern.
     There are other ways to beat TEMPEST, like making it damn near
impossible to get close enough to the computer in question to get a

I agree. Don't all monitors generate slightly (italicized) different
frequencies of EM radiation, even on the scan freq? If they do, then it
shouldn't be TOO hard to filter it out. Wouldn't a noise generator, if on
the correct scan frequency, or, if on the right EM rad. frequency, cause
problems for the monitor? It's just conjecture, but does anyone more

You claim to not be incidiary, but this is definately just that. I've

     Your attitude stinks. Have you ever heard of a term called
BRAINSTORMING? In case you haven't, or have forgotten the meaning,
Webster's New World Dictionary cites the following:
brain.storm.ing n.  the unrestrained offering of ideas or suggestions by
                    all members of a conference to seek solutions to
                    problems.
     I don't know about you, but this sounds EXACTLY like what's going on
here: The unrestrained offering of ideas or suggestions by all [READERS] of
a [MAILING LIST] to seek SOLUTIONS to [SITUATIONS WARRANTING ATTENTION].
     In reference to your job at the science museum, evidently, you were
the person who was the "doer." The people who wanted something done went
to the person who was responsible for doing -- you. I'm glad you no longer
have to job. It seems that your disposition, and attitude, are wrong for
the job.
     You didn't? Hmmm.... who said "But, because you folks apparently have
nothing better to do we have managed to generate a set of list traffic
that vastly exceeds the original forwards" just a few paragraphs ago? I'll
give you a hint, it wasn't me....
     True. You said it was a place for "[People who] apparently have

Unless the messages are given a delivery latency of , Traffic Analysis will allow for the tracking of messages. If, OTOH,
messages _are_ given a latency, but are garaunteed to be out of the
remailer in, say, 12 hours, it makes the task of tracking messages
anywhere from one degree more difficult to exponentially more difficult,
depending on how many messages flow in 12 hours. If you allow for dummy

I'm looking for a list of Anon Remailers that hopefully have most/all
of the following features, or at least get me in the ballpark. Failing
that, perhaps just a list of remailers would be nice. Requested features:
     o    I would like to be able to send a PGP [2.3-present versions!]
          file with commands-etc to be decoded and processed by the Anon
          Remailer. This allows me to not have to send my password-etc in
          plaintext. I realize that this will have to wait until after my
          first email to the remailer, as it has to get my key.
     o    Allows embedded PGP files: One for the remailer, which contains
          both a second PGP message and commands for the remailer.
     o    Allows passwording of anon accounts (I know, they probably all
          do this....)
     o    Reports back errors in command syntax-etc, using a pgp encrypted
          file.
     o    Uses latency and/or reordering.
     o    Relatively quick (this might countermand latency -- I'm not sure
          which is more important to me)
     I'm just getting started with remailers, and am interested in secure,
anonymous communications.

@_subject: Anonymous Transport Agents (Was: Latency vs. Reordering) 
I'm about to branch into the limits of my knowledge on this
particular topic: I run a DOS site under a heavily modified version of
Waffle (1.65 base), so the Unix-ish transport mechanisms are a tad out of
my realm of knowledge. With that in mind...
     Suppose an encryption-savvy mail transport agent, say ESMTP, was
developed. Further suppose that part of handshaking protocol for this
transport protocol included an ENCRYPTED reverse lookup on IP identities
to check that the message is actually coming from where it claims it's
coming from.  Suppose again that the results of this lookup were only
checked for correctness (boolean), and then discarded WITHOUT LOGGING, or
at least with minimal logging. If the reverse lookup was TRUE (IE: the
sending machine was who it said it was), the message was accepted. If it
failed, the message would be accepted, and then sent to the bit bucket.
     In this model, one could provide anonymous transportation of
anonymous mail FOR EVERY MACHINE ON INTERNET providing that the original
message wasn't forged. All that would be required (beyond running ESMTP)
is an encrypted version of the return address (a la Soda remailer) to be
placed some predetermined place in the message.
     This seems too easy: What am I missing? Have I actually come up with
a way to do this?

@_subject: Re: Anonymous Transport Agents (Was: Latency vs. Reordering) 
Fair enough. Let's assume that ESMTP will anonymize and sanitize each
message, making it appear as if it first appeared on the site. In other
words, lets say I send a message via ESMTP to someone. It gets sanitized
and anonymized (the return address is encrypted). This removes ALL traces
of the fact that it left from my node. Every site up the chain until it
gets to you will do the same. Finally you get a VERY anon/sanitized
     I said the return address is encrypted. That's true: it's encrypted
piece-meal. What happens is that the originator's site the sender's name
with its own key. Then, it encrypts its site name with the next site's
key. When it's sent, the site encrypts it's name, PLUS the previous
encrypted packet with the key of the next site up the net. This happens
until it reaches its destination. Even if the packet is intercepted, the
hacker only knows the previous site it came from. Let's say he intercepts
it between my feed and my feed's feed. This gives some 15+ choices as to
which MACHINE it came from, let alone which USER sent it, and that's only
on the first hop. On the Nth hop, it's AT LEAST 2^N possible MACHINES,
assuming that each hop has at least two feeds. More realistically, after
about 4 hops, the number of choices becomes entirely too large to
efficiently track. What do you think?
     Quite true. However, if the encryption system adds random-x bytes of
entropy to _each message_, the message sizes will never be the same coming
in as going out. It will always be larger, but each additional hop makes
the chance of tracking less and less. How many hackers can watch the whole
backbone??      Very true. But, again, it shouldn't matter... By the time it gets to
a place where the message is passed through 3 or 4 machines that one
person can watch, it's already been sanitized to the point of obsurdity,
no? Opinions?

A tad succinct, but perhaps not too far offbase. Is it fair to say
that we support the free flow of information, and place the responsibility
for maintaining the privacy of that information on the party said

     Now, I know that saying "we" has certain implications, mainly that of
a list consensus. However, it seems that a great many people here seem to
post to that regard. Am I correct in my observation?

Nah, Data Havens are well within the "charter". :-)
     This is your first, and foremost, problem. I'm not terribly familiar
with Perl, however, if it's half as anal-retentive as C is, make damn sure
you know your stuff, or at least have a trusted opinion on the subject (Hi
RS!! You know who you are!).
     Define your attacker. Who is this suppose to be "secure enough"
against? If it's Joe Avg. CompuGeek, yes, one should be "enough". If,
OTOH, the NSA is your intended foe, find 12. Then find 3 more. Then,
perhaps another 43. Then, MAYBE, you'll be "secure enough".
     You see, the problem with "secure enough" is that a good security
system, while not foolproof, makes the cost of attack substantially higher
than the cost of the information so gained. So, ask yourself: how much
"money" (IE: resources, time, and man-hours) is "too much" for the value
of the data and obscurity your DH will offer. Once you've determined this,
then, and ONLY THEN, have you determined how much security is "secure
enough" for your purposes.
     You'll pardon me for saying, but the hell with CI$, and to hell, even
quicker, with Fido. Anyone who's serious enough will find their way onto
Internet. Call me a purist, or a jackass, but the aforementioned are more
of a handicap than a help. I say drop 'em.
     Well, the only real way to do this SECURELY is for human intervention
to decide which keys are accurate and which aren't. Barring that, try
taking advantage of the keyservers. When a packet comes in, snag a copy of
ALL the keys this person has (and, perhaps, a few that haven't, just for a
confounding factor), and use them one-by-one until a match is generated.
Then, discard all keys. If no match, trash the packet.
Fair enough... multiple keys? How else?
     How about just saving the files under sequencial names (0000000001,
0000000002, base 62 (A-Z, a-z, 0-9))? Then, use a PGP-encrypted 1024-bit
key to encrypt the index file.
See above. . .
     To borrow a phrase from X-Files: "Trust no one." (X-Files, btw, is a
very cool show. New season started yesterday. Friday, 9pm, FOX). The
problem is a chicken-egg paradox: If no one uses your DH, what kind of
reputation can it have, but, in order to get a reputation, one has to use
it. . . I dunno how to handle this.
     Don't accept files when less than 5% of the drive is full. Send back
a confirmation code different from that of a successful transfer. Either
that, or trash the packet, adding a rather cryptic bounce message. The
exact wording and protocol will have to be established first, and only
known to people who use the DH.
Positively not.
Glad you asked. I'm not hardly a guru, but there's my $.02.
