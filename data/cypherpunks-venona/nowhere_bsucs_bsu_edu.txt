@_subject: New Remailer 
Fellow Cypherpunks:
     I am working on a program in C that will provide both anonymous
remailing capabilities and mail server operations.  In order to better
test the software I have installed it on my account through my .forward
and .maildelivery files so that all messages received with a header line
"X-Anon-To" or "Request-Remailing-To" will be remailed to the appropriate
address.  If you cannot add your own header lines with your mailer, set
the subject to contain "Request Remailing" and use the following format:
Request-Remailing-To: user
     Any of the following fields can be placed within the "::" delimiters:
     The remailer is case insensitive and you can place the "::" lines
anywhere within the message.  Signature stripping is NOT supported, however
a "kill line" will be implemented soon so that you can halt message
processing beyond a certain point.  Message body processors are supported
as an add-on feature.  PGP support would work as a message processor.  On
my end, I can define a "start processing" line and a "stop processing" line.
Only text between (and including) those lines will be passed to the message
processor.  Unfortunately, PGP is not installed on this system, so support
will have to wait.
     I will post full specifications later.  Plesae let me know of any
ambiguities.  Please also note that I am keeping detailed logs of the use
of this software for testing purposes, but I would rather delete all logs
than provide them to authorities.  The remailer is run on a multi-user
system for which I do not have a privileged account.

I think what he's saying is that a signature that identifies which
*user* on the system as well as the system name does not exist.  I'm sure
there are a couple, but I agree with your point that most BBS's on any mail
network append an identifying "tagline" or signature.  As a matter of fact,
in many nets it is a requirement that your system append a tagline to all
messages.  Incidentally, it is preceded often by "--" on a line by itself.

The reason why they were created (IMHO) was because most PC-based BBS
software only allows for a very limited space in the header for a From name
and for a To name.  For example, in ChaelBoard, a BBS package that I wrote,
this limitation is 31 characters (in order to make the string 32 bytes long).
Therefore, only names are used.  This gets ambiguous if two John Smith's
are sending messages to the same conference (similar to newsgroups).  So,
the systems started appending a line stating the origin of the message.
Sometimes it's as simple as "X BBS - (222) 222-2222 Smalltown, USA"  Other
times it's more complex.
     Some nets have decided upon a specific type of tagline so that they
all contain the same information in the same format.  Usually they contain
the phone number.  RelayNet(tm) and other popular nets provide for "Receiver-only, Routed" messages.  That is, the message is considered
private and sent from your system to a hub and that hub only sends it on
to other hubs or the appropriate node if it is connected to that hub.
Unfortunately, every SYSOP between your system and the receiving
system can read the message.  That's why encryption is important.
     Yes, gateways exist for many systems.  Most consider the tagline a
part of the message.  The de facto standard is to consider "--" on a line
by itself to mark the end of the message body and the beginning of the
tagline.  Users often append their own tagline before the system tagline.
Each mail reader has its own format, usually including the name of the
program on the line.

Yes, the intention is to get one approved without the SYSOP really
knowing who he approves.
     I used to check phone numbers, now I only check those of users with
strange names or wait until they abuse the system.  The first thing I check
when someone abuses my system is their identity.  If it's fraudulent, I put
the account in the system kill file and they can no longer login.  I use a
pretty good method for allowing access to adult areas.  A consent form must
be filled out and signed.  Then it is mailed to me with a photocopy of the
same person's driver's license (SSN can be blacked out, I'm not concerned
with it).  I file it away and give them access if it looks correct.
     Generally, I detect system abuse pretty soon after it occurs.  Then,
I handle the situation as quickly and efficiently as possible.  The same
user rarely tries it again.  I did voice validate all of my users, but that
got to be tedious, so I just check when something happens.  Many BBS's
require that they be able to call a user back directly before granting
full access.  This would not work over the Internet, a University modem
pool like many were using here, or long distance for the cheap SYSOP.
There are, however, a flurry of programs that perform "automatic call-back
telephone number verification."

to learn the more difficult UNIX or resort to CI$ et al or VMS.  I
personally use BBSes, UNIX, and VMS (in no particular order) and
enjoy each for its special abilities.  BBSes are a totally different
environment than UNIX, thus I think they will stick around for quite
a while.  They allow the sysadm to provide much more personality and
creativity than UNIX with very little knowledge of the underlying

The following changes have been made to the remailer running here

would please just try sending a few messages through the remailer so
I can be sure it is working (I don't care if you remail it to yourself,
but I want to look at the debug output so that I can turn off the logs.
 - Thanks to a suggestion on here, I have changed to the more standard
   "::" format.  If and only if the first line of the message after the
   header contains "::" will the lines following it up until a blank
   line *OR* another "::" on a line by itself be parsed as though they
   are part of the header.
 - Any "X-Anon-To," "X-Anonymously-To," or "Request-Remailing-To," lines
   in the main header or the secondary header will cause the recipient's
   name to be set to its value.  The last one listed will be the one to
   which the mail is sent (I haven't decided whether or not multiple
   recipients are going to be supported yet)
 - Any "From" line in either header will be stripped.
 - Any line except the "Subject" line will be stripped from the main
   header before being sent.
 - Any lines aside from those already described above that are contained
   in the secondary header will be appended to the header before the message
   is sent out.
 - No X-Anon-To, X-Anonymously-To, or Request-Remailing-To header lines
   will be passed on in case this remailer is being chained onto another
   remailer (which would cause an endless loop if it found its own address
   as the X-Anon-To field and didn't strip it on outbound mail).
     Please let me know what you think.  Once again, this software is written
in C and I plan to release source code when the project is completed.

I had an idea just a bit ago.  Here is the scenario:  a user wants
to know what my anonymous ID for nowhere is on anon.penet.fi.
All he has to do is send a message like the following to my account:
X-Anon-To: anXXXX  <-- his anon ID
     Then, that message will eventually get to him with my remailer's
anonymous ID on it!  That ID is the same as my personal ID.  Oops...
So, I made up a refuse list for the remailer.  Any address that contains
a "to" address that is on my refuse list will not be mailed to.  Complete
addresses can be used or just partial ones (for example "anon.penet.fi".)
I know that this also makes it impossible to mail to other users on the
penet site...  Oh, well.
     I just implemented the refuse list, so it will just "eat" any message
that is sent to an address on the refuse list.  No error message is sent
back to the user, it just doesn't get sent.  So, I guess my anonymous ID
is safe afterall.  :)  I would suggest that everyone else (if they
haven't already) refuse to remail to anon.penet.fi if their remailer is
setup on their personal account.

This is a longer response to the warning posted by Xavier.
You got me.  I meant only slight malice here:  I had intended to "expose" a few
email/anon associations to highlight the problem.  The problem became
apparent to me when I sent pseudonymous mail to a prominent person on
this list; his reply exposed his pseudonymous id at anon.penet.fi,
surely without his knowledge.
Now that would be a _very_ serious "bug" in the anon.penet.fi remailer
(or, more accurately, in its administration); I am confident Johan
Helsingius will reject this suggestion.
I think that merely masks the real problem.
I missed that discussion, or I wouldn't have wasted your (our) time.
Any ideas?  For starters, I think the default behavior of anon.penet.fi
is badly broken.  But a more serious problem with anon.penet.fi and the
other remailers I am aware of is the necessity that we pseudonymous
clients have to rely on the integrity of their administrators to keep
our pseudonyms private.  In the face of social pressure, such as
Xavier's, that may be asking a lot.

Can you elaborate on those other services?  The Finnish remailer is the
only one I'm aware of.
Also, I'm confused about these "not very computer-and-email-literate"
users -- aren't they forced to use an X-Anon-Password header?
I'm surprised there hasn't been more ruckus about the default
behavior.  There must be many folks whose identities have been
inadvertantly exposed.
I don't think this will help.  With my mail environment, I have to go
to lengths to send an anonymous message, concocting X-Anon-To and
X-Anon-Password headers.  It's worth the effort, since this helps to
preserve the secrecy of my pseudonymous identity.
But the first time I mess up, and send an unfettered message to an
anon.penet.fi client, I am unmasked.
What I'm saying is that I'm hip to headers; it's the simple stuff that
trips me up.
And I still don't understand how the unfettered message gets past the
X-Anon-Password filter.
I think the risk of accidental exposure is heightened by the default
behavior of the Finnish remailer.  Maybe we're using the same words to
describe different things.
Some of us gave up on USENET policy long, long ago.  Personally, I stick
to the alt.* groups.
In time, I hope such warnings will be unnecessary, as people grow
accustomed to the use of pseudonyms.

I'll restrict my comments to anonymous email, but the application to

Should the remailer expose Alice's identity in the message that it
forwards to Bob?  If it does so blindly, Alice's anonymous identity is
subject to accidental exposure.  If it does not conceal Alice's
identity, then certain expectations of anonymity might not be realized
(according to Johan).
Here's a way out that will satisfy me and Johan: assign Alice a new
pseudonym here and now, one that will be good for replies only.  If
Alice has registered with the remailer in the past, i.e., if she has a
password, then she knows how to X-Anon-To:, but has opted not to.  If
she has not registered, then it is also appropriate to assign her a new
ID.  However, should she later register, I suggest she be given a new,
permanent, password-protected ID, just in case her earlier reply
inadvertently exposed her real ID (in the way we have been discussing).
In essence, I'm suggesting that the Finnish remailer have two classes
of anonymous IDs, one that is password protected, and one that is not.
The former should never be used without the X-Anon-Password header.

name than X-Anonymously-To *or* put it at the end of the message instead
of within the header.  I admit that my remailer was "broken" in the
terms of others, so I have fixed it.  This problem would have been
fixed sooner if I had realized what was going on, but since I foolishly

Here's an idea....  What if I added anonymous ID's to my remailer such
that the following would occur:
Messages with "Command: Create ID" header field will result in a random ID
being allocated to that user's account (if one does not already exist) and
mailed to the account.
Messages with "X-Allow-Reply: yes" header field (for example) will result
in the user's anonymous ID being sent to the recipient in a header field
(not From: because I do not have alias capabilities on this system).
Messages with "X-Anon-To: " will get forwarded to the anon ID's
actual address.
     This is a sort of on-demand reply mechanism.  I could make flags on the
anon ID's so that I can disable a user's ID, set send/reply privileges, etc.
If a user wants to change his ID, he could send "Command: Change ID" or
"Command: Delete ID" to the remailer.  Then, I could either setup a waiting
period, make it require manual attention, or make it automatically do as
requested.  Since the program is written in C, about half of this is
trivial.  Making it secure is the most difficult part.  By default, of
course, messages would have no reply ability.  Any user who replies will
send mail to me.  They would have to specifically place the X-Anon-To header
line with the person's anon ID into the message.
     On the other hand, I could institute a serial number scheme where each
message receives a serial number.  Replies to that message for the period
of a week or a month or whatever I choose will be forwarded to the sender.
Each one has a different serial number no matter who it came from.  Of
course, this would require both a self-maintaining cross-reference list
and an extra header field and/or work on the part of the person who replies.
     I was wondering, what is the opinion on this list (just reply to me,
so we won't clog up cypherpunks any more than we (my remailer) already have)
as to whether or not I should append a footer to remailed messages saying
"Remailed by: nowhere or some such nonesense that will let

my remailer.  All you have to do is put the line "--ignore--" exactly
as that, no spaces after it, no spaces before it, just a line precisely
like that and neither it nor the rest of the message will be put into
the outgoing message.  Edgar, you can test it by sending to my remailer
on this account.

I thought that someone would bring it up, but since no one has, I
guess I will.  Isn't is very easy to accidentally type na1234 or an1234
when intending the other?  It's just a matter of transposing two
characters.  This could result in a user signing a message that is
sent with the anonymous ID or accidentally sending the actual address
when thinking it was anonymous.  Since a password can be assigned,
the prior could be eliminated, but the latter is still possible.
     I commend Johan for his work and appreciate the new service,
regardless of how it may sound.

Uhg...  This is not a good sign.  My remailer is running on a
university computer system as well.  I have been trying to get a SLIP
connection for the past few months for my 386BSD system so that I can
take part of the load off of their system and provide anonymity on my
local hardware.  The sysadmin don't know about my remailer and I am
trying to keep them from finding out.  Right now, my mail volume is so
high that those messages are cloaked by the rest of my incoming and
outgoing mail.  Plus, it isn't used that much.  I have approval for
my mail servers, because we worked out a modification to slow down my
program so it wouldn't flood the system with sendmail processes.
Unfortunately, I don't have approval for the remailer, but at the
same time, there has been no mention of it.
     In the login banner, it says, "This system will be monitored for
unethical and malicious behavior."  That sort of leaves it up to them
to decide whether or not to shut down the remailer and they can just
give a quick "it's not ethical" reason.  Luckily, they like me.  :)
In the long run, I am working on a solution, but money is tight.
Otherwise, I would have a T-1 coming directly into my house and all
would be fine; well at least better.
     Enough rambling--I'm sorry to see a remailer demise and hope
that mine will not fall under the unethical clause here.  If I find
a solution, you will be the first to know.

@_subject: ANON/ANNOUNCE: Sysadmin Policies at Universities (and high schools) 
It sounds like someone needs to take a stand against the UCS policies
at Buffalo or else they are going to go farther and farther...  Trust me,
that is happening on this campus too.  I used to go to high school here
on the other end of campus.  It was a new HS when I started (first graduating
class) so they had a lot to learn.  I walked in, found the manager of the
LAN and other sundry computer duties, and told him, "I would like to help
you out in any way I can.  I would suggest enlisting my help, because you
don't want me on the other side."  I thought it was kinda cute with the
right balance of cockiness...  Well, he didn't enlist my help...  He gave
up coordination of the LAN after a lot of student troubles and the next
guy was a real tyrant.
     If it weren't for the work of five "lab supervisors" (i.e. student
assistants to the sysadmin) the system would have fallen last year.  I
was one of the five and we worked very hard to keep the students' interests
in mind while steering policy to an open and simple system.  Now that we
are gone, they made the policy more restrictive step by step.  A student
presumably got access to the sysadmin's account and changed all of the
Novell stuff around so that the students were sysadmin but the sysadmin
couldn't get into the network at all.  (oops)  Now they have gone to a
closed lab policy:  each person has to run his/her student ID through
a scanner, gets assigned a computer, and is watched like prey.  Any files
that have "questionable" content or are named "unsuitably" are deleted
and the student loses his/her account for a few days.
     They are suspending kids for a week just because they bypass the
program that lets the sysadmin view their screen.  Granted, this LAN
is owned and operated by the school, but they would not set a policy
even when we proposed one to them that was in their favor (at the time).
So, the policy changes from day to day and the students, being the
oppressed, get the short end of the stick.  I have taken myself out of
the situation as much as I can...  Strangely, I now work for the
university's LAN support group, but they know better than to assign me
to jobs dealing with the HS.  The students have no voice there--I realize
that minors do not have freedom of speech, but grievances should be heard
and policy should be decided in an unbiased way.  I disagree with some of
what the students are doing, but I abhor the policy (or lack thereof) of
dealing with "crimes" by the students.
     If you want to let Buffalo take a turn for the worse as far as
policy goes, then don't say anything about their decisions.  I would
NONviolently oppose whatever you think is not right.  The questions
I have for you are:  how do you get an account on their system?  If
every student is given one (like our VMS system at BSU) then they will
likely not take it away if you fight for your rights.  If you have to
request the account and they disable them as soon as you no longer
"need" them, you should be careful about which channels you use...  I
would have friends complain for you.  :)  Do it anonymously through
a remailer...
     No matter what, if you are passive, you'll lose.

a request to all you folks out there.
I am thinking of doing a research type paper on the internet and security.
More to the point, I'm interested in how the internet users themselves view
security. If internet and security strike some cord in you, please send me
some email about your babblings.
My goal is to get a general impression about how the people
who use the net feel about the security measures that exist or may soon exist
and whether or not they are a help or a hindrance to the net and its use.
For the rest of you on a more specific note, here are some questions that
hopefully will get your creative juices flowing.
Do you think the internet is secure?
What types of security measures would you like to see put in place?
In an ideal world, how would security work? What would be protected?
What kinds of measures would you need to gain access to the information?
Should the DES be the standard for encryption?
Do you think access should be restricted? (period, should all information just b
e free?)
Do you like people who make anonymous postings?
Should a human have _any_ part of the anonymous servers?
What do you think of Hackers? Do you like them? Are the a benefit?
What do you think of the NSA, FBI, CIA, and everything else government related?
If you knew how to hack into your bank account and change the amount of money yo
u had, would you?
If you have an answer to one (or all or anything in the middle) of these
questions please email me back with your answer. Help me pass my classes
and graduate. *grin*

FYI, my personal responses:
     Nope...  There are lots of "security holes" discussed in alt.hackers
and related places.
     I don't think much security is necessary...  If you must have some,
let's make sure terrorists can't bomb the computer systems between me
and the outside world so that my Internet work can get done.  :)
     Well, I think each user should have a "public" area and a "private"
area.  Public stuff can be seen by anyone wandering by.  That could be
the casual observer using anonymous FTP or NFS mount or someone local to
your system.  Private stuff should be kept away from the sysadmin's eyes
as well...  There is no good way to do this, of course.  I would like
either of the following scenarios:  sysadmin has a laissez-faire attitude
to my files and how I use the system or sysadmin can't see or control
either of the above.
     No.
     What I want protected should be protected and what I want available
should be available.  Right now, I have difficulty making what I have
available to others.  At the same time, I don't have enough quota to do
any kind of work (my account is full with PGP 2.1, the remailer, and my
     On an individual basis, I like some and dislike some.
     Yes, the human should be there to answer questions and reboot the
server when it hangs.  :)
     I like them and I think that much of the work that has been done
for the good of the community has been done by hackers.  I think it is
important to be able to finger a soft drink machine at a university in
another state.  :)  I vigorously agree that they are beneficial.
     Well, if that isn't a way to lump it all together...  The government
of the U.S. and the U.K. and Australia to some extent from what I have seen
seem to believe that they need to have a hand in the control of computers,
information, and computer communications of information.  I think the should
have access and possibly provide access for the poor, but they should not
control any of the above.
     Is it traceable?  ;)  No, I wouldn't.  I work for a modest sum and I
spend that money as I see fit.  I live comfortably on what I make, so I
do not ask for more.  When I find that it is too little, I will ask for
more, but stealing is not necessary because I will be happy no matter
how much I have (as long as I have computer access 24 hours a day).

Stuff for the whistleblowers group. This looks like some good shit. Way cool--Pentagon gettin' zapped!
F-117A Nighthawk ("Stealth") Program--Summary
The primary RAM and infrared-reflecting material used on the F-117A
Nighthawk, also known as the Stealth Fighter, is Dow Chemical's Fibaloy
(Lockheed Memorandum TK-523). Fibaloy is used for structural airframe parts
in the F-117A and for skin panels, spars, ribs, and 1ongerons. Only 10
percent of the airframe's structural weight is from metal. Reinforced
carbon fiber, developed by the Air Force Materials Laboratory at Wright
Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio, is another important RAM used on the F-117A.
This material not only absorbs radar energy, but dissipates it as well and
helps reduce the F-117A's infrared signature. It is used primarily for
high-temperature areas like outer skin panels near the engines, and wing
and vertical-fin leading edges.
The F-117A's unique shape is one factor that contributes to RCS reduction.
Edges are rounded, and skins are made of Fibaloy in a secret and difficult
manufacturing process. These skins are built in multiple layers that are
filled with bubbles and tiny fibers oriented in a specific alignment,
spacing, and density for maximum RCS reduction. This process is the most
secret element of stealth technology. Parts are formed using super-plastics
and are joined with strong adhesives. Kevlar 49 and Silag are used in key
crossbar struts.
Internal structural architecture of the F-117A has an even greater effect
on RCS reduction. A design called cut-diamond, which employs several
thousand flat surfaces, is used on the F-117A. Each of the small, flat
surfaces is angled so it does not share a common radar reflective angle
with any other small, flat surface. When a radar beam strikes the F-117A,
only one or two of the flat surfaces reflects the incoming radar energy,
while the adjacent surfaces present too high an incident angle to reflect
the radar energy back to the radar receiver.
The cut-diamond structure is covered by a layer of Fibaloy and Retinyl
Schiff base salt materials that is able to absorb 98.7 percent of all
radiated energy. Like the SR-71, internal plastic radar -absorbing
triangular inserts are fitted to the F-117A's vertical-fin and wing leading
edges. Iron ball RAM (supplied by TDK Magnetics, cf. Import Waivers) is
applied to external surfaces and to some internal metal parts. All gear
doors and access panels are specially shaped and tightly fitted to maintain
the airframe's low RCS.
To enhance its low visual signature, the F-117A employs both active and
passive background-masking camouflage techniques that enable it to change
color to match the background. Two camouflage colors are used: flat-black
for night missions, and dull gray for day missions.
The active camouflage technique is "background-clutter signal to aircraft
RCS matching." This technique makes use of the F-117's extensive ECM/ESM
suite and does not require any changes to the aircraft's structure. With
this technique, an F-117A flying at low level protects itself from
look-down interceptor radars by matching its overall RCS (as detected from
above) with that of the terrain below. This ability makes the F-117A show
up as ground clutter on the interceptor's radar, provided the F-117A's RCS
precisely matches that of the terrain below it, and the hostile radars
would simply reject the clutter and the F-117A masked in the clutter, and
never detect the F-117A. ECM/ESM equipment is housed in smart skins, or portions of the F-117A's
airframe that incorporate microcircuitry, thus avoiding the need to install
antennae or sensors that might have a high RCS on the outside of the
airframe. This feature has the combined benefit of saving space on the
inside of the airframe and permitting the airframe to be lighter and
Reconnaissance/weapons systems include a forward-looking laser radar used
for both terrain-following navigation (TERCOM) and for attacking targets. A
forward-looking infrared (FLIR) system is installed, as well as a low light
level TV and a head-up display. Its weapons suite includes the optically
guided AGM-65 missile and the AGM-45 Shrike antiradiation missile. The
AGM-88A high-speed antiradiation missile (HARM) is also included. An
advanced gun system developed by Hughes called the in-weather survivable
gun system/covert is installed, and all weapons are carried internally.
Another weapon that is planned for deployment in FY 93 is the AGM-I36A
Tacit Rainbow antiradiation drone missile. This weapon can loiter after
release and protect the F-117A from hostile radar tracking by detecting and
destroying hostile radars. The Tacit Rainbow is small enough that four can
be carried internally by the F-117A.
In one recent test of the F-117A's weapon aiming and guidance system, a
500-lb bomb was dropped from altitude of 10,000 feet, and the bomb scored,
going right into the top of its target, a 55-gallon drum. Results are
similar to the Gulf War experience.
Lear Siegler has developed a quadruple redundant electronic fly-by-wire
system for the F-117A that eliminates the need for control cables, thus
saving weight and simplifying construction. The pilot controls the F-117A
with a side-stick controller mounted on the right side of the cockpit.
The F-117A pilot sits on an ACES ejection seat. The pilot's canopy has flat
surfaces, and should be coated with an optically transparent RAM to prevent
radar reflection from the pilot or cockpit equipment. Landing gear is
designed for rough-field operations, and each gear leg has a single wheel.
Infrared signature is reduced by mixing fan-bypass air and air from cooling
baffles with exhaust gases. Mixing of air with exhaust also has the benefit
of reducing the acoustic signature. Because infrared homing missiles track
aircraft by the heat of their exhaust nozzles, not the heat of the exhaust
gas, the nozzles are made of materials that keep the infrared signature
low. Cooling baffles and special coatings also help reduce the infrared
signature from hot engine-exhaust nozzles. Newer infrared homing missiles
with all-aspect launch angles can track only the exhaust plume, but the
work done to cool exhaust nozzles and cool exhaust gases on the F-117A (and
other stealth aircraft) makes infrared lock-on by these kinds of missiles
highly unlikely.
Two modified nonafterburning 12,500-1b General Electric F404-HB turbofan
engines power the F-117A. Two-dimensional thrust-vectoring exhaust nozzles,
which can vector thrust in various vertical and horizontal positions, are
installed; however, the nozzles are only two-dimensional in shape, with no
vectoring capability. Material around the engine bays is a matrix sandwich of polymers and
pyramidic noise-absorbing structures. The sound-proofing is so effective
that the F-117A  makes only a medium-level (53 dB) humming noise at a
distance of 100 feet, and on takeoff a slight whine (61 dB) is heard. The
F-117A uses a Benson-designed Rotorduct system that provides additional
cold thrust from the engines. The Rotorduct system is connected to the
forward and aft sections of the engines.
During night operations, the F-117A flies lights out, with no navigation,
strobe, or position lights of any kind. F-117As are equipped for all-weather
operations without any outside assistance. All guidance systems are
passive, except for the laser radar, but that gives no signals that could
be detected. Guidance systems include a ring-laser gyro based inertial
navigation system and global positioning system receiver, both of which are
passive navigation systems. Although the F-117A can fly at supersonic speeds (Mach 1.73), most of its
flying is done below the speed of sound close to the ground to take
advantage of terrain-masking of hostile radar installations. High-speed
flight at low levels also protects the F-117A from infrared-guided weapons
or infrared detection systems. At higher altitudes, the F-117A would be
exposed to such systems for longer periods of time, while at low levels,
the F-117A is not over one area long enough for weapons systems to lock on.
Even if the weapons could lock on briefly, the F-117A flies so quickly that
it would be long gone before the weapon could shoot it down. Operating at high speeds and low levels makes the F-117A somewhat unstable due to its large wing/fuselage planform. USAF cites this as one reason,
among others, for one or two of the four operational crashes. The F-117A
uses small ride-control vanes similar to those on the nose of the B-I
bomber. These are known as impedance-loaded flow-control vanes, and they
alleviate the often bumpy ride encountered during low-level and high-speed
flight. Supersonic flight in the F-117A is inefficient because of the materials
from which it is built. Some of the materials, while excellent
detectability signatures, have a rough finish that add to the F-117A's
parasite drag. F-117A Operational Basing
An F-117A unit is permanently based at Tonopah Base (Area 30, also known as Sandia Strip and Mellon Strip) in the northwest corner of the highly secret
Nellis Test Range about 170 miles from Las Vegas, in Nevada. Tonopah Base has 72
hangars and was refurbished in 1979 by the U.S. Air Force. (It hadn't been
used since World War II.) The unit is known as Team One--Furtim Vigilans
(covert vigilantes), and there are 95 F-117As based there. (The term literally means "vigilant by stealth" or "stealthily vigilant" in Latin.) The
full-service F-117A wing gained initial operational capability in 1983 at
Tonopah Base. There are F-117A temporary-duty (TDY) detachments at Elmendorf AFB and Shemya AFB in Alaska, Kadena Air Base in Japan, and in the United Kingdom. The F-117A also has been active in the Middle East and in Latin America, used
in the Gulf War and in covert drug trafficking survellance operations.
The U.S. Air Force uses the F-117A in various roles and has integrated F-117A operations with those of the rapid-deployment forces and with the new special
operations command. Two of the F-117A's known missions are covert
reconnaissance and covert surgical strikes on preselected targets. In
operational tests, this effective stealth aircraft has flown within 17
miles of actual Soviet-manned radar stations without being detected, and
Soviet-manned Iraqi radar stations detected fewer than 3 of the F-117As in
753 different sorties over Iraq.

The code that is included here was not intended for release yet.
There are several bugs and oversights.  I have been going through a

What is here is the old source patched to do most of what I want it to
do.  You can see that there is support for a file processor and indeed
PGP works okay with it, but I don't *like* the way they work together,
so I do not recommend using the processor feature.  In the redesigned
version, the remailer operator can setup as many file processors as
he/she wants.  A file can be processes several times before it gets

can be linked to another place) or is defined at the beginning.  Let

@_subject: REMAIL: sendmail.cf problems 
I am working on a new project on 386BSD with pseudonymous user ID's.
What I want to do is use a rule in the /etc/sendmail.cf file to make
all messages to "anon. be processed by the anonymous contact service
and everything else to be processed as local mail.  I added the following
lines to my configuration file and made a new frozen config file, but I
keep having trouble getting it to work:
Ranon.$-	$
Macs,	P=/usr/guest/anon/anon-reply, F=nlF, S=10, R=20, A=anon-reply $u
     The first line should make all mail directed to "anon.*" be processed
by the mailer "acs."  The second should define a mailer named acs that
executes anon-reply.  I found that this would make it impossible to alias
anon.post, anon.admin, anon.ping, anon.help, etc.  So, I changed the first
line to:
Ranon.[0-9]$-	$
     That makes newaliases stop bitching about the aliases, but any mail
directed to an anon. account bounces and it says "User unknown."  I
ignored the alias problem once and actually got it to get farther, where
it said "Unknown mailer error 2."  I think that's because it was using
from a friend.  (acs2.2 is what I got, it was used for alt.personals)
     I want to rewrite it, but the important part is getting the aliasing
to work.  The rest is a piece of cake once I can get sendmail do to this.
I hate to rebuild my alias database, besides which, that slows down ALL
mail.  If anyone knows which RFC's to look at for the sendmail.cf format
or has experience with this problem, I would be eternally grateful.

I would strongly suggest _Hackers_ by Steven Levy (ISBN: 0-440-13405-6).
After you have read this book, you will have a very good understanding of
what true hacking is (versus all of the new "meanings.")  After that, perhaps
the _Hacker Crackdown_ by Bruce Sterling (?).  Then after that, you pretty
much choose your own course...  If you want to get into MSDOS programming,
you will get lots of interrupt listings, disassemblers, etc.  If you want to
get into UNIX programming, you will get lots of UNIX books, recompile your
kernel a few times, etc.  :)  Hacking is a very personal experience for me,
and usually I'm hacking.  The term is defined as "learning by trial and
error."  You can hack a car if you get the manual, sit down, and just start
fiddling until you get it right.
     Incidentally, psychology backs up hacking as a good method for learning,
because operant conditioning (where when you are on the right track, you
start getting positive responses [rewards], so you go in that direction, and
when you eventually get it right, you will remember how you got there) is
known to be a strong teaching tool.  For example, your program isn't working,
but when you add a particular statement to the code, it starts to behave,
but the results aren't right.  So you follow in that vein of thinking and
soon enough the whole thing is fixed (aside from new undocumented features.)
I thought that psychology would come in handy sometime...

[ Info on offline readers ]
     Yes, that's a definite possibility.  Most of the popular offline
readers require that you first send them a packet (usually empty) so that
they will put you in the database.  The reader could just accept a certain
file (pubkey.asc for example) that contains the key you want to be used.
Then all sessions with you will be so encrypted.  Your mail to the BBS could
also be encrypted with the BBS's public key.  Unfortunately, one problem
still exists:  I don't know of too many BBS's where the e-mail messages are
actually encrypted on the disk.  As a matter of fact, the SYSOP can usually
read all mail.
     Some of those programs (MegaMail, TomCat, etc) run PKUNZIP to unzip the
file(s) then take care of the files themselves.  There isn't an easy way to
throw in encryption.  I would be willing to add an encryption option to my
offline mail software, though.  I have written a UTI (Universal Text
Interface) for ChaelBoard that lets it interface with RelayNet(tm) and
offline mail readers that use UTI's.  I also write a QWK/REP interface that
allows  ChaelBoard to be a node (the hub software isn't quite done yet) on
WildNet and for offline mail reading/replying.  I could implement encryption
in the ZIP/UNZIP step (for the users who have PGP keys registered with the

                   THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE FROM
                    GOVERNMENTALLY IMPOSED CRYPTOGRAPHY
               Proposed to Cypherpunks-at-large, May 20, 1993
    When, in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
people to disregard and challenge the communicative and neo-political
bands which have connected them with their Government, and to assume
among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which
the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect
to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes
which impel them to the opposition.
    We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Communications
should be designed equally and, that they are endowed by their
creators with certain unalienable technical aspects, that among these,
are Privacy, Communications Liberalism, and the pursuit of Cryptographic
Freedom.  That, to secure these rights to publicly available crypto,
the Government which was once instituted among Men, and derived their
just powers from the consent of the governed, that, whenever any Form
of Government once became destructive of these ends, it was once the
Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new
Government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing
its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect
their Communications Safety and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will
dictate that Governments long established, should not be changed for
light and transient causes; and, accordingly, all experience hath shown,
that mankind is more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than
to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
But, when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the
same Object, evidences a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism,
it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government
abuses and to provide new Guards for their future communications
security.--- Such has been the patient sufferance of these
Cryptographic soldiers; and such is now the necessity which constrains
them to attempt to alter their former Systems of Government.  The history
of the present President of The United States of America is a brief
history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct
object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny and imposition over
individual rights to communicative privacy.  To prove this, let Facts
be submitted to a candid world.
    He has implemented a policy which may possibly usurp the citizens
privacy in electronic communications, which at least, will indeed
submit private communications to unjust scrutiny under his agencies
    He has attempted to impose these standards without academic or
public scrutiny.
    We have not been wanting in attentions to our cryptographic
practices; this is true. It does not, however, indicate that we are
guilty of crimes of any sort.  We have alerted our governmental
representatives, from time to time, of attempts made by their
legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.  We
have reminded them of the circumstances of our professional and
private idealisms.  We have appealed to their native justice and
magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common
kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt
our connections and correspondence.  They too have been deaf to the
voice of justice and of consanguinity.  We must, therefore, acquiesce in
the necessity, which denounces our united objection, and hold them, as
we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
    We, therefore, the Representatives of the Cryptographic partners
resident in the computing networks and establishments, in General
Consensus, Assembled, appealing to the legislative bodies of the
United States of America for the rectitude of our intentions, do,
in the Names, and by Authority of the good People of the Networks,
solemnly publish and declare, That the computer community is, and of
Right ought to be, Free and Independent of governmentally imposed
cryptographic restrictions; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance
to the proposals implemented by the National Security Agency, The
National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Clipper
purveyors by-and-large, and that all political connection between
them and the United States of America, and ought to be, totally
dissolved: and that, as Free and Independent communicators, they have
absolute rights to private electronic communications without
Governmentally imposed sanctions which may unethically submit their
communications to Governmental scrutiny. And, for the support of this
Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine
Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our sacred Honor.

 It does, and I can expand further in subsequent paragraphs.
 He used a very simplistic example, one which is electro-mechanical, as
 another list participant already pointed out. The same ELINT
 potential eavesdropping techniques exist, which range from keyboard
 monitoring (passive and active) to synchronic monitoring of "visual
 displays," which by all rights, parallels the electronic equivalent
 of monitoring your "visual" data; what is written to your visual
 display.

 TEMPEST was/is a specification that was written/developed to
 safeguard classified communications which were transmitted
 electronically, and rightly so. Digital Cryptanalysis is easy to
 record, measure and study; emissions are emissions. Its a well known
 fact that INT agencies were/are active in monitoring secure
 communications _recording_ for years, simply on the basis that the
 keys would be eventually compromised. The technical specifications
 of TEMPEST implementations on _SECURE_ systems are classified,
 likewise, the tempest requirements on confidential and FOUO (For
 Official Use Only) communications are less classified, at least to
 the level of their traffic. This was/is done in anticipation of
 secure, captured traffic analysis being eventually compromised. I
 have reason to believe that this exactly the tactics being mined now
 by the FBI/NIST/NSA. (whoops, slap my wrist) Traffic analysis is a
 dangerous concept when used in the wrong context, especially in a
 big brother capacity.
 Additionally (no classified information divulged here!), both the US
 INT agencies and the KGB sponsored intelligence agencies, recorded
 _all_ intercepted communications regardless of cryptographic
 tolerance, eventually under the guise that they would be compromised.
 This idealism alluded to the fact that compromised keys could be used
 to analyze past communications and provide information on future
 strategies.

 Our Government is cheating us. Something needs to be done.

 I'd suggest doing the same.

not as easy as I would like to have believed before starting the
project).  It will give you an ID and will restrict mail from and to
certain addresses/sites.  It also puts a standard header into the message
and has features to add header lines and footers to the messages
     The system will sit idle (aside from mail) most of the time, so
I have no problem using PGP and being an encryption drop-point.  I am
about to start a rewrite of my remailer pretty soon because it needs
some help.  Anyway, I will send you all the IP address and host name
of my computer when it's online.  This could get exciting...  I have
a guest account on there where you can request an account, but I
can't afford to give out too many accounts.  Of course, I would much
rather cypherpunks have accounts than a bunch of sniveling netbrats.
     Anyway, gotta run.  Incidentally, I have about 3 MB of backed up
mail here.  It's only since the second week of May!

@_subject: REMAIL: X-Discard header line added 
In an effort to make creating more traffic for the Cypherpunks
remailers easier, I have added a feature to my remailer.  Whenever it
receives a message that would otherwise be remailed but contains a
header line saying "X-Discard:" it will discard the message and act as
though it got remailed.  If all of the Cypherpunks remailers supported
an automatic discard feature, we could setup cron jobs or whatever kind
of software we want to send "junk mail" to the remailers that does not
get forwarded on.
     An idea I just had was to make the X-Discard have a counter.  If
the number is greater than zero, decrement it and forward the message
to another known remailer.  If it is less than one or non-numeric,
discard the message.  Right now, it just discards whatever message
has that header.
Example Message:
Request-Remailing-To: bob&tom
X-Discard: Please!

Eric has already addressed this; I intend to make my remailer PGP
capable soon.  If not the one on bsu-cs, the new one will have PGP as
soon as I can get to it.
     I'm not sure what you mean about bouncing it around to different
remailers, because if there are a lot of remailers, it could take a long
time before it finally gets to the appropriate one that can decrypt the
destination information (perhaps longer than the TTL and therefore it does
not get delivered).  With encryption, the remailers don't have to know the
recipient until the last phase anyway.  In addition, they may not know the
contents of the message either.
     Right now, we have plenty of bandwidth because the remailers don't
get much use.
     ALL:  Which is better:  X-Discard or X-TTL?  I can easily change it
to X-TTL.

@_subject: REMAIL: X-TTL functional 
I should know by now that whenever I get an idea and send it to the
list it ends up getting lots of addons and changes from other list members.
So....  I added an X-TTL field to the header.  It reads it, decrements it,
and writes it.  If it's in the message received, it will be decremented and
passed on.  If it isn't in the message, it will be set to one then later
decremented (last stop).  If it should be zero when it arrives, it will be
swallowed up.  Messages that get sent will have a header field of X-TTL with
a value of zero or greater.
     Note that it shows up as X-Ttl in ELM, but doesn't matter in the
software because it converts everything to lowercase then checks it
against its keyword list.  The X-TTL field can be either in the main
header or in the pasted "::" header block.  I suppose that if the TTL
is greater than zero when it goes to send, the remailer should throw
in another remailer's name at random and make up its own "::" header
block, but that is for later...

@_subject: Encrypted communications with phone and PC 
I am about 300 messages behind on the list because I'm dialing in long-
distance right now, but I just happened to think of something because it is
related directly to my work...  I install and debug voice mail systems all
the time that run on 286's, 386's or 486's and can run up to 24 telephone
lines on a single computer *at full speed*.  The analog signal gets
digitized by the voice board, compressed, and stored on disk whenever a
person leaves a message.
     What if an extra step were added where the information were encrypted
before being written to disk and it took the receiver entering his PGP
key on the PC before it would play the messages to him?  Then, if this
works, the user on each end could use a computer with a voice board in it
and dial into one port while an encrypted/scrambled session is being
transmitted on another port.  Who knows how real-time it would be and
I don't have the technical expertise to pull it off, but I see these
things go out of our office every day with little security other than that
of obscurity on them.
     One note, though, the voice boards that we use (high quality) cost
anywhere from $800 for a repaired one to $1000 for the one I like the best
to $1200 for a different brand that we also sell.  Neither voice mail
software vendor is willing to give us the super-secret security code that
unlocks full system access, so I seriously doubt if I could scare any
source out of them.
     Anyway, it is a thought and now that I have my own voice board to
play with I might just try to piece together some interesting software.

New Crypto Standards in Contention
by Charlotte Adams
   Experts are hotly debating the Clipper initiative, a plan to
standardize on a voice-encryption device with built-in
law-enforcement access.  Although de facto or mandatory
acceptance of Clipper or similar hardware now seems remote, the
potential cost of such action makes it worth considering.
   The rationale for Clipper was to maintain the government's
information-eavesdropping capability as the use of encryption
spreads.  The hope was that the market would follow the
government's lead, making Clipper the de facto standard.
   The National Institute of Standards and Technology sees
benefits in making Clipper the accepted standard.  "If we deny
[criminals] the use of the national communications net, [that's
a] nontrivial accomplishment," says Ray Kammer, NIST's acting
director.  If the network standard is Clipper, he reasons,
criminals would "have to set up their own [communications]
system, an interesting and formidible task."
   NIST is pushing ahead with a proposed Escrowed Encryption
Standard.  If all goes well, this Federal Information Processing
Standard could be in place by October, an important step toward
widespread use by the federal government.  The key-escrow
mechanism should be in place by autumn, government sources say.
   A related issue is NIST's Digital Signature Standard, which
was developed in secret by the National Security Agency.  NIST
added a new issue to the DSS debate last summer when the agency
announced a proposed settlement with Public Key Partners giving
PKP control over commercial use of the standard.
Clipper pros and cons.
   The key-escrow concept, allowing access to law-enforcment
agencies, will have to become mandatory because it makes no sense
on a voluntary basis, critics say.  "It clearly has implications
for data transmission, as well," says Phil Karn of Qualcomm, a
San Diego maker of cellular telephones.
   Government contractors, in fact, are already fine-tuning
another chip, called Capstone, which will be much more convenient
for data-security applications.  Capstone will add the NIST's
secure hash, digital signature and key-exchange algorithms to
Clipper's Skipjack encryption algorithm and escrow support.
   "Clipper is good for voice, for telephony, but not as a
coprocessor inside a PC, selectively encrypting fields," says
Richard Ankney, a technical consultant with Fischer International
Systems Corp.  "Capstone is better in that regard."
   The trouble with Capstone is that it is big and expensive, a
full custom, very-large scale-integration ciruit design, says
John Droge, vice president of program development for chip
designer, Mykotronx Inc., of Torrance, Calif.  VLSI Technology
Inc., in San Jose, is actually fabricating the chip.
   Mykotronx expects the chips initially to sell at $100 apiece
in quantities of 10,000.  PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association) cards initially will sell in the $300
range, he predicts.  That's a far cry from the government's $100
target price for the PCMCIA module.
   If the hardware becomes mandatory, space would have to be
found for the chips inside notebooks and palmtops, as well as in
laptop and desktop computers.  Estimates on the markup to
customers vary from 25 to 200 percent.
   The cost of retrofitting Clipper or Capstone into existing
machines would be tremendous, says Fred Gluck, director of
marketing for control products with Datamedia Corp., a Nashua,
N.H. security software and token vendor.  Simply multiply the $25
to $30 per half-hour you pay for technical people times the 100
million or so PCs out there, he says.
   But much of the cost may be hidden from the end user, Ankney
counters.  "You could take the hit and not raise the price at
The Digital Signature Standard.
   Although eclipsed by the Clipper controversy, DSS nevertheless
remains an issue.  Even though its algorithm is not secret, NSA
"played a very dominant role" in creating it, says David Sobel,
legal counsel for the Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibilty.  The secrecy surrounding NSA's role in DSS goes
beyond the will of Congress in the Computer Security Act of 1987
for the "[standards] development process to be open and
accountable," Sobel says.
   The PKP angle is also a problem, CPSR says.  The arrangement
by which  NIST allows PKP to control commercial use of the
Digital Signature Standard "really comes down to ... almost
paying them off," says Marc Rotenberg, director of CPSR's
Washington office.
   People shouldn't read too much into the proposal, NIST says.
"It means ... the government wants to move on and get this out of
the way ... without any acknowledgement of [the validity of the
PKP] infringement action," explains F. Lynn McNulty, NIST's
associate director for computer security.
   The "big payoff" of the proposed agreement is that individual
citizens communicating with the government won't have to pay
royalties, he says.
More information needed.
   Almost everyone agrees that more information is necessary
before a policy decision can be made.  "Are we talking about
completely revamping the communications infrastructure to
facilitate 800 wiretaps?" asks Daniel Weitzner, senior counsel
for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  EFF coordinates the
activities of the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group, a
coalition of information security technology companies and
non-profit groups that has raised many questions about Clipper.
   "We want a real, solid understanding of the problems from [the
administration's] perspective and a fact-based risk assessment,"
Weitzner says.
   NIST's own security and privacy advisory panel refused to
rubberstamp the Clipper initiative at first sight and various
interest groups have demanded a more thoughtful and open review.
   The Digital Privacy and Security Working Group has been asked
to contribute substantively to the ongoing interagency crypto
policy review, EFF's Weitzner says.
   CPSR, however, is forming its own policy review group.  The
administration's approach of taking outside imput is still
essentially a closed process, CPSR says.  "The point we're trying
to make [is that] the public has an interest in its privacy and
consumers have an interest in what they ultimately might end up
paying, " Rotenberg says.

Bill Murray  writes -
 I remember this story, Bill, and I find this correlation
 interesting. It's funny how Schneider's name hasn't really
 surfaced in such a long time. In fact, once I think about the
 real parallels to Herren Doktor's lip service, I find it even
 frightening, given the anticipated impact with which her opinions
 seem to affect governmentalism.
 For what its worth, there was another interesting item concerning
 Schneider which appeared in Info Security News this issue, in their
 "Top Ten Events" article of the top ten info-security events since
 the inception of computers.
 I relay the pertinent portion of this article below:
 "Jerry Schneider was not the first computer crook, which he
 became at 18; nor was he the first computer security consultant,
 which he became at age 21. Still, his antics on both sides of
 the law helped bring computer crime to the awareness of the
 public in general and business managers in particular.
 Although still in high school in 1968, Schneider started a
 company called Creative Systems Enterprises and began selling
 electronic telecommunications gadgets he invented. Each day as
 he passed the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company office, he
 scavenged the firm's dumpster for discarded equipment that could
 be used to build his gadgets. He also collected a wide variety
 of documents, ranging from invoices to training manuals. Within
 just a few years, he became an expert on telephone company
 technology and business, and reportedly knew more about Pacific
 Telephone's telephone equipment supply procedures than any of
 its employees.
 In June, 1971, Schneider set into motion an elaborate plan to
 steal new telephone equipment from Pacific Telephone and resell
 it as refurbished equipment through Creative Systems. Eventually
 the scam would net him hundred of thousands of dollars worth of
 Pacific Telephone equipment. Scneider accessed Pacific
 Telephone's computerized ordering system and by using a telephone
 card dialer succeeded in placing orders for equipment. To
 complete the scam, he needed to learn the telephone equipment
 budgets for individual telephone company's sites, equipment
 inventory levels and other key pieces of information. He
 gathered  the required information by getting access codes to a
 commercial time-sharing service used by the telephone company
 for inventory control and parts distribution.
 In January 1972, acting on information provided to them by one
 of Schneider's former employees, law enforcers raided
 Schneider's offices and a warehouse where they found equipment
 the district attorney said was worth $8,000. They also learned
 at that time that Schneider had stolen a total of $125,000 worth
 of equipment. Later, Schneider would admit that he had taken
 close to $900,000  worth of goods.
 The day after his arrest on February 8, 1972, newspapers across
 the country called it one of the most famous computer crimes
 ever. "How he Folded, Spindled, and Mutilated," one headline
 said.
 In a plea bargain, Schneider agreed to plead guilty to one
 count of grand theft of $5,000 worth of equipment. In July, he
 was sentenced to two monyhs in a minimum security corrections
 institution. In all, however, served 40 days and paid a $500
 fine.
 Later that year, Schneider, then only 21 years old, formed a
 computer consulting firm catering to companies that did not want
 to get ripped off by cyber-crooks. He stayed in the business
 until 1977. Today, he owns a firm that sells off-shore banking
 services.

presumably viral detection) software or documentation, as defined by

required to register as an arms trafficker if it wants to include a

Dear Sir:
It has come to the attention of this office that your company is
making cryptographic source code and technical data available
for commercial export claiming a technical data exemption
from the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
Cryptographic software, including source code, is a munitions
article as defined in 22 CFR # 120.1, category XIII(b).  Further,
the exemptions listed in 22 CFR # 125.4 for technical data do
not apply to cryptographic software and source code.  A valid
Department of State license is required to export cryptographic
source code.  As such, it would be a violation of the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations to export
cryptographic source code without a valid Department of State
export license.
We take this opportunity of advise you that any company or
individual who engages in the United State in the business of
either manufacturing or exporting defense articles or
furnishing defense services is required to register for a fee
with the Office of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) pursuant to 22
U.S.C. # 2778(b)(1)(A) and 22 C.F.R. Part 122.  Furthermore, the
export of such defense articles and related technical data must
be licensed by the Department of State in accordance with 22
U.S.C # 2778(b)(1)(B)(2) and 22 D.F.R. Parts 120-130
(International Traffic in Arms Regulations).  A booklet entitled
"REGISTRATION: The First Step in Defense Trade" is enclosed.
If you are unsure whether an article is on the U.S. Munitions
List, you may send five (5) copies of descriptive literature
about the product and request a commodity jurisdiction
determination from this office according to 22 C.F.R # 120.5 of
the ITAR.
If you have any questions regarding the matters discussed in
this letter, please do not hesitate to contact this office at (703)

Compliance and Enforcement Branch
I guess this means that all FTP sites who implement the GET command
and have anything to do with crypto or viral detection, including
RFCs, overviews or discussions of specific techniques or algorithms,
etc. must be registered as International Arms Traffickers *even if*
they disallow all but domestic FTP connections.
What to do now.
My advice to this new twist of the NSA and State Department regulating
activities *within* the United States is twofold:
(1) GET and FAMILIARIZE yourself with PGP sources or other crypto
options NOW and upload it to your local BBS (if you deem it still
legal for you to do these things) and
(2) Consider supporting the Electronic Freedom Foundation.

In case you haven't heard:
  NIST Explains Clipper "Review"
     The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has clarified the role of five experts selected by the agency to evaluate the government's Clipper Chip proposal and the underlying SKIPJACK cryptographic algorithm.  In a recent letter to the CPSR Washington Office, NIST asserts that the panel was not established to provide "advice or recommendations" to the government.  Rather, according to NIST, the reason for convening the group was "to provide the opportunity for independent experts to satisfy themselves as to the strength and effectiveness of the algorithm in order to encourage widespread acceptance of it in the marketplace."  NIST concludes that the panel's evaluation therefore falls outside the scope of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which opens the work of advisory panels to public      In response to CPSR's request for documents relevant to the panel's review, the agency reveals that
     NIST has no records which were made available to or prepared
     for the five experts for the purpose of enabling them to
     evaluate the Clipper Chip proposal.  Any such records would
     be in the possession of the National Security Agency, where
     all activities related to the work of the experts were
     conducted.
This disclosure provides further confirmation that NSA, and not NIST, is the driving force behind the Clipper proposal, despite NIST's public role as the "proposing" agency.
     The only NIST document released to CPSR is a copy of the invitation sent to the five experts who participated in the evaluation.  That letter describes the "key escrow" system and states that the escrowed keys will be made available "only to authorized government officials under proper legal authorizations, usually a court order."  This language -- "usually a court order"

excerpted from:
Communications Week
No. 473, September 27, 1993
page 36
Cylink Triples Encryption
by Sharon Fisher
Sunnyvale, Calif. - Cylink Corp. has announced an encryption product
that improves security by encrypting data three times using current The Cylink product uses the Data Encryption Standard, which defines a 56-bit key for scrambling messages to prevent access by unauthorized
users. DES was adopted in 1977 as the U.S. federal standard for data
Skirting DES Limitations
Some users have expressed concern, however, that DES' 56 bits cannot
prevent a determined attacker from using more powerful hardware and
software to crack the code. The Cylink product addresses the problem
by using DES to encrypt the data more than once, according to company
Cylink's Cipher/Decipher-HSi offers triple-DES, which encrypts DES
data three times, and gives the 56-bit key the effect of a 112-bit key,
according to the company, based here. The triple-DES approach makes the Cylink product more secure than the government's proposed Clipper system, which uses an 80-bit key, the company said.
Users could get the triple-DES effect by manually encrypting data
three times, but the process would take three times as long as single
DES encryption, Cylink noted. Cidec-HSi uses improved circuit technology
that performs the three encryptions without taking that long, the
company said.
Cidec-HSi works at speeds of up to 2.048 million bits per second and
is available with a wide variety of interfaces, Cylink said. It
also includes a public key management system, which lets users
exchange keys so that they can read each other's messages. The device also offers an optional embedded channel service unit, which can
be connected directly to the public T1 carrier network, the company
Cylink said it can retrofit current Cidec-HSi systems so they can
benefit from the new triple-DES technology.
AT&T Compatibitlity
The company said that Cidec-HSi meets compatibility standards for
use with AT&T's Accunet T1.5 and Extended Superframe Format services.
Cylink can be reached at 735-5800.

Yes, but it would also discourage lurkers like me who are here to learn

and to get more money you have to post something useful that people want
to read, the "startup cost" associated with the list would grow as time

CA-93:15                         CERT Advisory
                               October 21, 1993
            /usr/lib/sendmail, /bin/tar, and /dev/audio Vulnerabilities The CERT Coordination Center has learned of several vulnerabilities
affecting Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun) operating systems. Three
separate vulnerabilities are described in this advisory.  The first and third vulnerabilities affect all versions of SunOS 4.1.x and all
versions of Solaris 2.x.  The second affects all systems running any version of Solaris 2.x (but does not affect SunOS 4.1.x systems). Patches can be obtained from local Sun Answer Centers worldwide as
well as through anonymous FTP from the ftp.uu.net (192.48.96.9) system
in the /systems/sun/sun-dist directory.  In Europe, these patches are
available from ftp.eu.net in the /sun/fixes directory.
Information concerning specific patches is outlined below. Please note that Sun sometimes updates patch files.  If you find that the checksum is different, please contact Sun.
III. /dev/audio Vulnerability
     This vulnerability affects all Sun systems with microphones. This
     includes all versions of SunOS 4.1.x including 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3,
     4.1.3c, and all versions of Solaris 2.x including Solaris 2.1      (SunOS 5.1) and Solaris 2.2 (SunOS 5.2).  Sun is addressing this      problem in Solaris 2.3.
     A. Description
        /dev/audio is set to a default mode of 666. There is also no
        indication to the user of the system that the microphone is on.
     B. Impact
        Any user with access to the system can eavesdrop on conversations
        held in the vicinity of the microphone.      C. Solution
        To prevent unauthorized listening with the microphone, the
        permissions of the audio data device (/dev/audio) should allow         only the user logged in on the console of the machine to read         /dev/audio. To prevent unauthorized changes in playback and record         settings, the permissions on /dev/audioctl should be similarly         changed.
        *** Any site seriously concerned about the security risks
        associated with the microphone should either switch off the
        microphone, or unplug the microphone to prevent unauthorized
        listening. ***
        1. Restricting access on 4.x systems
        Use fbtab(5) to restrict the access to these devices. See the
        man page for more information about this procedure.
        2. Restricting access on Solaris 2.x systems
        To restrict access to these devices to a specific users, the         permissions on the device files must be manually changed.
        As root:
        # chmod 600 /dev/audio
        # chown . /dev/audio
        # chmod 600 /dev/audioctl
        # chown . /dev/audio

Recent extremely unpleasant personal experiences in cyberspace have given me, at the same time, deep scars and deep epiphanies. Following are some messages from the Cypherpunks mailing list generally on the subject of
`pseudospoofing' -- the possibility that some people are posting or emailing under *different* `identities' from multiple sites, specifically
with the intention of camouflage and deception.
I have watched the development of anonymity on the internet with a high
degree of personal interest, advocacy, and commitment. But this recent
realization of the potentials and extent of `pseudospoofing' has deeply disturbed me. The most shocking realization is not just that it is technically feasible but is possibly *widespread* in certain quarters of the Internet. It alarms me that some are championing pseudospoofing (and
what I have been calling `black' posts and email) as `liberating' and `refreshing' under the guise of `privacy' or `true/pure anonymity'.
The idea of `spawning identities' for `psychological exploration, sociological experiments or sexual thrills' repulses me. It sounds to me like advocation of perversions and multiple personality disorders.
And much to my shock, horror and disgust it appears to be a major component of the Cypherpunk philosophy. (I even wonder if the mainstream media has been misled about the true cypherpunk agenda, and so far have not been comforted by anyone `real'.) And the idea
that `support' for projects be measured by `how many people are motivated enough to go to the effort to make multiple but individually unique, reputable posts in favor of a proposition' is absolutely bizarre.
I have been publicly and privately assaulted and ridiculed so thoroughly, searingly, and viciously in both public and private flames by so many apologists and moral relativists on this subject that it has encouraged a certain degree of personal paranoia. In fact, I cannot count a single strong supporter so far. The whole black affair has opened my eyes to the extraordinary potential for grotesque evils such as manipulation, treachery, conspiracies, and brainwashing possible by combining the openess of electronic forums and `pseudospoofing', particularly in private email.
I think that anyone who subscribes to this public internet mailing list should be warned that it may be a bizarre `experiment' in pseudospoofing and brainwashing on unsuspecting or unwilling participants. I certainly would never have subscribed if `I knew then what I knew now'. Its deeply upsetting that I may have been trying to cultivate friendships with nothing but phantoms, parasites, and
betrayers on the list and in my personal mail or that this has polluted my other online activities.  The bizarre perversions found in my personal mail far surpass everything I have posted here, and have quite traumatized me -- something like virginity violated by a rapist.
The evasive, blase, flippant, and cavalier attitude by top `leadership' in the group on the subject horrifies me. (One eminent
contributor to the list even suggested to me in email that a
secret `elite' list existed or was in the works, presumably free
of this reprehensible toxic waste.) Many respondents have taken
the position that prohibitions against `pseudospoofing' are
equivalent to invasion of privacy and government oppression. One
very prominent poster suggested, as an insult, that `state run registries of legal persons' were reminiscent of `key escrow' systems like Clipper! I find this quite ironic, given that such
a system already exists, called `birth certificates'!
Even more upsetting to me the possibility that this practice of
pseudospoofing may be infecting and corrupting mail lists devoted to serious project development of Internet technologies. I fear the openess and freedom of these forums is being subtly and insideously poisoned by increasing pseudospoofing -- perhaps a systematic and concerted campaign. It seems to me that resolution
of the issues of identification and authentication are absolutely
crucial for future internet development, and that some minor sacrifices in current `freedoms' will be the profound investments
required for a harmonious future atmosphere.
I will have more to say in various forums on the subject in the
future. This is an introduction and background. I hope that eminent Usenet contributors will address the multitudes of issues this
raises.  I have spent valuable reputation capital in pursuing this
matter, and have made many new enemies over the past few weeks, and
am sure I will be branded as the new premier cyberlunatic by many, but if I am branded a `paranoid ranter' by terrorists and criminals it will only upset me if they're not in jail.  I believe this issue of identification has paramount importance to everyone currently
involved in `cyberspace' and its future development, perhaps even the  issue that must be resolved for basic progress -- how much
authentication and identification is to be required?
Note1: see talk.politics.crypto for a `user survey' on the subject        and possible future postings.
Note2: these postings have been edited slightly.
H.  Finney I've been thinking about this a lot lately. I think a large part of the
problem as you indicate is associated with reputation. How does one
build up a reputation and identity in cyberspace in general? Part of
the problem IMHO is that this list software & the internet in general
is extremely vulnerable to a lot of different kinds of spoofing.
People are very sensitive to the perception of a `consensus' -- they
are deeply influenced by what they perceive to be the `majority
opinion'. What if that `opinion' was not an accurate representation of
reality? what if a few people were creating the illusion that some
different kind of consensus existed? what if that `agenda' were
actually something inherently wicked like lawlessness or anarchy? what
if a conspiracy created the impression that some project or progress
was underway when it really wasn't? or that some person was loudly
favored or condemned by the `group'? this could be especially
problematic if any kind of intimidation were happening `behind the
scenes' in email. who would ever know? unless the dissatisfaction
reached the list, how would we find out? another problem is that, at
the same time being strongly influenced by a lot of flames, people just
delete them out of sheer distaste and they may not be around later for inspection.
what really is our assurance that all these email addresses actually
exist and represent *unique* people? there really is very little currently. I think newsgroups are far less vulnerable to this kind of spoofing,
but unfortunately mailing lists are *extremely* vulnerable. (Keep in
mind, there are a whole set of other benefits and detriments in *other*
categories which I'm not talking about here.) In the former we have
thousands of subscribers all checking on each other's honesty. If a
suspicious address or opinion pops up, there is some probability
someone will notice, and cases of spoofing would probably be noise
drowned out in the representative opinion. Also, distribution is
centralized, so that `message blocking' is not very feasible.
In the latter case, i.e. mailing lists such as this one, there is a
much closer knit community that is geographically isolated. Individuals
on the list are far more susceptible to spoofing. People are more
likely to see *every* message including the `spoofed' ones. There are
far fewer people to `check up' and those that are there may not have
the technical expertise. What's worse, the list is not `distributed' in
a certain sense. If someone wants to get out the message that
`something wrong is going on' it could be censored because of the
centralization of the distribution. This wouldn't work with Usenet
because the distribution of the messages (e.g. NNTP servers) is
generally cleaved from the people with strong self-interests in the
traffic (e.g. people who post to group [x]).
This cyberspace stuff can be a *very* powerful influence on many. It is
an electronic community, and peer pressure is *extremely* powerful.
Many people do not have an extremely strong internal `moral compass'
and could be influenced by this kind of corrupt magnetism associated
with a `conspiracy of spoofing'. Note that reputations are crucial in
not only persuading us to listen attentively to those we respect, but
to `tune out' the lunatics and criminals.
* * *
Regarding the what also gets my vote as `strangest posting of the year'
by `S. Boxx',  Philippe D. Nave, Jr.  (based on
I think I speak for many here in saying that I weigh anonymous postings
very little, but don't consider the capability a serious problem. They
have very significant purposes in e.g. `whistleblowing' `within the
system' that I've always been attracted to.
On the other hand, I think there is an implicit assumption by virtually
everyone here that addresses on public posts and private email that are
not specifically anonymous represent *unique* people. That is, if some
people were taking advantage of the loose, free, and open atmosphere
here to influence opinion or perception of reputations by posting
messages under different presumably `real' identities (defined as
anything that is not obviously tagged as anonymous), I and probably
everyone else would feel very `upset' in the least and `violated' at
the most. It would seem like a very serious breach of community trust,
and might even have the effect of derailing positive contributions to
the `cypherpunk cause' (whether algorithmic or political, the two chief
schools of thought). I recall discussions of this related to the
Extropians list, which specifically bars this practice.
* * *
List suggestions
The fact that this `uniqueness of real identities' has always been
something of an implicit assumption here bothers me. I think anything
this delicate and important should be made formal and explicit. We
should not simply assume that `everone is honest and no one would be
depraved enough to do this.' I think the following guidelines are very
reasonable, and might be part of a list charter agreed to by new members:
1) list members are allowed *one* anonymous identity if any. They are
required to associate some name with all anonymous posts via that identity.
2) *no one* is allowed multiple `real' identities and in fact any
violation of this is considered an extremely serious breach of netiquette & honesty.
3) completely anonymous posts from `outside' the list are allowed; if
no pseudoidentity is given they are assumed to come from `outside'.
and if anyone has been posting under multiple `real' identies, I think
they owe it to everyone here to `come clean'. I don't see why anyone
would go to the trouble but if someone was just unstable or obsessive
enough to equate reputation with posting traffic, s/he might go off the
deep end. The practice amounts to `spoofing' and any patriotic
cypherpunk with some integrity ought to recognize that immediately and
condemn it, technical capabilities regardless. I would equate this
practice with `lying to one's colleagues'. spoofing is probably the crime against cypherpunk ideology.
* * *
As for reputations, what can we do about this? I think that there are a
lot of solutions to be experimented with in software. One of the best
is just to have archives that are searchable by ID. But archives are
very disk-consuming. I have some various other ideas that wouldn't
require much beyond the current database maintenance of email
addresses. Suppose that along with everyone's name, the following
statistics were presented:
1) how long they have been on the list in days, 0 if none at all
2) how many postings they have posted here
3) maybe a posting/age ratio -- some people seem to be very sensitive
or tune out people with a high one.
4) another idea: tracking the number of responses a given poster has,
average, per original post, measured by `re: [x]' subject tracking.
now, look what we get with all these. They are all simple to implement.
They all can tremendously help us weigh the various opinions that are
out there. They can set up a positive feedback system whereby `good'
posters potentially really are quantitatively identified.  Regarding
(4), one way to `punish' a poster for irrelevant postings is to simply
not respond, and they will not get any `credit' in this statistic. The
problem with this is that from my experience, sometimes my most
authoritative and finely-crafted postings generate the least response.
But note the point of all these things: they don't necessarily require
any digital signatures to implement. Authentication of postings
`allowed' to the group really seems like a separate problem to me.
Another simple idea is to have a voting system in response to postings.
People's `credit' associated with their postings could be listed in
headers too. This of course is far more ambitious, and the generally
complex problem of authentication rears its ugly head.
In addition to all this, I would like to see protocols that guarantee
honesty on the part of the list maintainer. When databases like this
are maintained, a little unilateral tweaking here and there can be
extremely deleterious to community integrity, honesty, and reputations.
That which can never be enforced should not be prohibited.
The claim that a person should have only one pseudonym per forum
indicates profound misunderstanding.  If someone wants to have
multiple cryptographically protected pseudonyms, they will be able to;
that is one of the main goals of cypherpunks software.
The situations you despise will occur.  This is reality.  Change your
own psychology or change your own software.  You will not be able to
change the other person.
I don't like the idea of state-run registries of "legal persons."
Better to live with the occasional vagaries of digital pseuodonyms
than to ban them.
(And multiple identies can have many uses, some good, some not.
Welcome to the future.)
Since it may touch on our "cypherpunks agenda," I plan to read up on
some of these proposals for "is-a-person" credentialling and see how
they might relate to schemes for centralized key registration or escrow.
Any suggestion besides the "Crypto" proceedings?

Ciphertext, the RSA newsletter (v1 n1, Fall 1993) showed up in my mailbox
this week. It contains much useful and interesting information, as well as
an announcement of RSA's 1994 conference on January 12-14. What follows are
some digested excerpts, posted with permission.
On the Clipper front there is a very useful and non-polemical summary of the
technical aspects of Clipper by Paul Fahn, and an article by Martin Hellman.
Hellman is a Distinguished Associate of RSA Laboratories, one of the
inventors of Public Key technology, and a Professor of Electrical
Engineering at Stanford. He's not happy with Clipper as presently proposed,
and says why.  Since the article is based on his NIST testimony, the latter
can be obtained by anonymous ftp at isl.stanford.edu in
The third annual RSA Data Security Conference is at Redwood Shores, CA. It
costs $245 per person. There is no Onsite registration. Deadline is Friday
12/17/93. For details contact RSA. Registration is limited to 400 and
includes the conference, tutorials, and hardcopy conference proceedings, as
well as a cocktail reception, and breakfast and lunch on all three days.
Apple Ships RSA Digital Signature in Long-Awaited System 7 Pro. On October
4th, Apple Computer introduced millions of new users to the RSA Digital
Signature. The producs are called PowerTalk and PowerShare and are part of
System 7 Pro, a new version of the Mac operating system. They include five
components, integrated into the operating system--Messaging, Electronic Mail
Directories, Privacy and Authentication, and Digital Signatures. They also
include RSA's RC4 symmetric stream cipher for server-to-server link
encryption. Powertalk is compliant with the Public Key Cryptography
Standards, and users will receive a voucher for a free unaffiliated
"residential digital certificate, good for use with any secure PKCS or
Internet PEM-compliant application.
The Apple System 7 Pro implementation is PEM-certificate compatible, and the
messages are as well.  (For those who want privacy, RIPEM Mac operates with
the key pair generated by the Mac.) There is an API to the sign/verify
functions of the MacOS so that any app developer can use the features
without needing to license from RSA. Of course, the MacOS with RSA Digital
Signatures is fully exportable. RSA has a free signer utility for
Windows that is compatible with the Mac sigs.
Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail Arrives. Several commercial and freeware
versions are available right now:
TechMail, written at MIT, is a complete mail reading program for Macintosh
and (soon) Windows. It includes full implementation of the Internet PEM
RFCs, using RSA's TIPEM toolkit as its security engine. It is a client of
the Internet Post Office Protocol. Techmail for the Mac is available from
net.dist.mit.edu in pub/TechMail. It runs on SLIP or non-SLIP. (Poster's
note: The SLIP version incudes PEM and works fine. I haven't tested the
non-slip version and am not sure if it yet includes PEM.)
TIS/PEM and T-Mail are non-commercial freeware and commercial supported
versions, respectively, of Trusted Information Systems implementations of
Internet PEM. The former was developed under contract with ARPA and
agreement with RSADSI and is available in source code for academic research
or exploratory use by corportions or individuals on the Internet. For more
information send e-mail to tispem-support
TIPEM 1.1 is the latest release of RSA's Toolkit for Interoperable
Privacy-Enhanced Messaging. It permits creating applications that comply
with the Internet PEM standards as well as the commercial Public Key
Cryptography Standards (PKCS) established by vendors including Lotus, Apple,
Novell, and Microsoft. The toolkit was used for Apple's Powertalk. It is
available directly from RSA Data Security Inc.
RIPEM is another freeware public key encryption program designed for
Internet PEM. It implements a subset of PEM as described in RFC's 1421-1424
The internet host ripem.msu.edu acts as a RIPEM key server for users who
choose to register their keys. It is available via anonymous ftp from
rsa.com and non-anonymous ftp from ripem.msu.edu.
RSA Certificate Services Center Opens for Business. This article describes
the center RSA has established to get ral certificates with your name,
public key, and organizational affiliation safely embedded in a
cryptographically tamper-proof digital document. This provides the digital
ID for Apple Powertalk, Internet Privacy-Enhanced Mail, or any X.509
certificate-based secure application.

Interesting that you should apply a product libel case to your own
situation. Are you a product, David? Which manufacturer produced you?
A better precedent, of course, is Gertz v. Robert Welch Inc. David
Sternlight, after having thrust himself into the vortex of public opinion,
will find it hard to avail himself of the protections against reputational
damage that a private citizen has.
My statement falls so clearly within the area of non-actionable speech
that your case would lose on summary judgment. I'd move for sanctions, of
course, since Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as well as
comparable state rules, sanction the initiation of frivolous lawsuits.
Ask your attorneys how they like Rule 11 sanctions, David. Whoever those
attorneys are, that is.
First, it's not false.
Second, libel law doesn't distinguish between lawyer statements of fact
and non-lawyer statements of fact.
Third, it's not an ad hominem, as that term is used precisely.
Please, please don't dig yourself any deeper. If you like, I can give you
some examples of truly defamatory and non-defamatory statements, so you
can learn the distinction. In the meantime, I await the letter from your "attorneys." Nothing would
give me more pleasure than to slamdunk a frivolous libel suit.

@_subject: PKCrack available (fwd) 
Newsgroups: sci.crypt
Organization: University of Hamburg -- Germany
NNTP-Posting-Host: fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.2 PL2]
Hello, everybody!
After receiving more than a dozen messages of the type "could you
please send me a copy of PKCrack", I got tired of e-mailing it and
decided to make it available via anonymous ftp. It can be obtained as
A few remarks.
1) The archive contains the source (in C) of the program. It should
compile anywhere. Don't ask me to send you a compiler or to compile it
for you. If it happens not to compile on your machine - do the porting
yourself. Be creative. Don't ask me to teach you C if you can't
understand the program.
2) The archive also contains the file APPNOTE.TXT, from the PKZIP
distribution, which explains the format of the ZIP archive in general
and the encryption algorithm in particular. (BTW, this explains why I
put the archive in the texts directory.) The algorithm applies both
for versions 1.1 and 2.04x of PKZIP. The only difference is in the
paragraph that explains how to verify that the password entered is
correct - version 1.1 deals with a 2-byte number (as the text says),
while version 2.04x deals with a one-byte number (as the text doesn't
bother to explain).
3) The program is *trivial*. Really. It does a dictionary attack and
thus requires a dictionary - a file containing the words to try as
passwords. Don't ask me to send you one - there are many on the net.
Find one yourself. Learn to use Archie.
4) The program cannot break just any archive - it can only check
whether the archive is encrypted with one of a (possibly huge) list of
5) If you are trying to break an archive created with PKZIP 2.04x, you
will get a lot of false positives. Averagely - once in every 256
attempts. It will help if you have several files in the archive,
encrypted with the same password. If this is the case, increase the
value of NFILES and re-compile the program (yes, I know that it should
be a run-time option). A value of 4 will give the same level of false
positives as for version 1.1, but even a value of 3 is good enough for
practial reasons.
6) If you don't know how to do anonymous ftp - learn. If your system
does not allow you to do anonymous ftp - use a ftp-by-email service.
7) If you don't have unzip for Unix - get one. Don't ask me to e-mail
you the program in source. If you don't know how to transfer files
from the mainframe to your PC - ask your system administrator, not me.
8) I have no idea who has written the program.
9) If you come up with any improvements, you are welcome to send them
to me. If they are good, I will update the program that is on the ftp

 by Lance Rose
Phil Zimmermann is a computer programmer and good citizen with an earnest
desire to help others. For much of his adult life he expressed his concern
through political activism, from marches in the 70's through teaching classes
in military policy in the 80's. Along the way, Zimmermann became a computer
network user. As the 90's began, he saw a new threat to our civil rights
surface: a movement to curtail the ability of network users to discuss
matters in private. Many others on the net saw the same thing, but Zimmermann
actually did something about it. He melded his humanitarian ideals with his
programming and cryptographic skills to create an e-mail encryption program
for Everyman called Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP. He did this at no small cost
to himself. An independent computer consultant, Zimmermann shelved most of
his paying gigs while finishing up PGP, missing five mortgage payments on his
family's home in the process.
Zimmermann finished PGP in early 1991, released it in the U.S. on the
Internet from his home in Colorado, and it instantly achieved worldwide
popularity among network cognoscenti. PGP is free, and its customers get a
lot more than they bargained for. It uses a powerful RSA public key
encryption system, in which each participant owns one or more private
key/public key pairs. Messages encrypted by one key in the pair can only be
decrypted using the other key. The great advantage of public key encryption
is that, unlike older schemes, like DES, (the current U.S. standard), you can
publicly circulate the key for encrypting messages sent to you by others,
since only your secret private key can decrypt those messages. When someone
sends you a private message using PGP, first it encrypts the message text
using the IDEA algorithm, (the International Data Encryption Algorithm,
developed in Europe and comparable to DES), and generates a unique,
confidential key just for decrypting the message (we'll call it the "text
key"). Then he or she uses the RSA public key they received from you to
encrypt the text key, and sends you both the IDEA-encrypted message and the
RSA-encrypted text key. You would then use your RSA private key to decrypt
the text key, and finally use the text key in turn to decrypt IDEA-encrypted
It would be conceptually simpler to use only the RSA public and private keys
for encrypting and decrypting the text, and cut out the IDEA encryption step,
but there is a practical cost. Text encryption using RSA requires far more
computer processing time and power than IDEA-based encryption. Zimmermann
wanted to give people the full benefit of PGP without wasting time watching
their computers crunch numbers, so he used the far easier to process, (but
still highly secure), IDEA technique for message texts, and saved the public
key RSA process for encrypting only the IDEA text keys, which are a mere 128
bits long. Thus, PGP creates securely encrypted texts, gives people the
ability to distribute their public keys far and wide with no compromise in
security, and extends strong encryption capabilities to those with small
After its release PGP became something of a community development project,
and it is now in version 2.3. Other programmers and cryptographers work on
enhancing the source code, creating foreign language translations of the user
interface, and porting PGP from its original DOS platform to other popular
computer platforms such as Mac, Vax, and most flavors of Unix, further
increasing its usefulness to network users of all stripes. In the past two
months, however, some dramatic new chapters swiftly opened in the ongoing
saga of Phil Zimmermann and PGP.
First, on the positive side, some patent-related questions nagging PGP from
the very beginning finally may be close to resolution. As soon as PGP
appeared, a West Coast company called Public Key Partners, headed by Jim
Bidzos, claimed it violated a patent they held in computer implementations of
the RSA encryption algorithm. While Bidzos did not rush into court, he did
seek to suppress PGP's distribution. Among other things, he sought out the
major online distribution points for PGP, such as large online services like
CompuServe and GEnie BBS's including The Well, and requested that they
immediately remove the PGP files from distribution because they infringed on
his patents. Most services discontinued providing PGP,and it soon became an
underground classic, difficult to find unless you asked the right people.
Fortunately, there were many such spread across the net. Rather than
challenge the patent claim, which some net observers think a worthwhile
effort, Zimmermann made many requests to Bidzos to obtain a license to use
RSA without hassle in PGP. Eventually, network community and industry leaders
tried to obtain some sort of compromise between Zimmermann and Bidzos. Bidzos
refused all entreaties and continues to oppose PGP.
In the meantime, a software company named ViaCrypt obtained a license a year
or two ago from Public Key Partners, (who appear willing to license virtually
anyone but Zimmermann), to use the RSA algorithm in software. ViaCrypt took
some time after securing the rights to figure out how it would use them.
Finally, last August, it approached Zimmermann with a proposal to create a
commercial version of PGP. This was a great business opportunity. ViaCrypt
could use its license to legitimize PGP for the commercial market, and both
could profit from PGP's high profile among companies interested in
encryption. To bring PGP within ViaCrypt's license from Bidzos, Zimmermann
and ViaCrypt have been replacing PGP's existing RSA encryption subroutines
with comparable licensed subroutines developed by ViaCrypt. Bidzos, through
his attorney, publicly expressed some doubt about whether the new ViaCrypt
product will fall within its RSA license rights. Anticipating this
possibility, ViaCrypt shrewdly trumped it in advance by securing a legal
opinion from Brown and Bain, considered by many computer lawyers, (this
author included), to be the leading computer law firm in the country, that
the hybrid product is within the scope of ViaCrypt's license from Public Key
Partners. The new program, tentatively brand named ViaCrypt PGP, is scheduled
for rollout on November 8th of this year.
If ViaCrypt PGP succeeds in the market, Zimmermann will make some money,
though he was never really was in it for the money. He is also working on a
new approach to the free version of PGP that may end the patent threats that
continually hinder its open distribution on the net. His current efforts
center on a set of encryption subroutines called RSAREF, released by Bidzos
through another of his companies, RSA Data Securities Inc. (RSADSI). There is
a license to the public to use the RSAREF subroutines free for noncommercial
purposes: you can't make money selling it, and you can't use it for
commercial messaging. By replacing PGP's custom RSA subroutines with publicly
licensed equivalents from RSAREF, Zimmermann could end the patent
infringement problem.
RSAREF was designed to let programmers develop privacy-enhanced mail (PEM)
programs using a scheme similar to that used by PGP. The text is encrypted
using an easy-to-process encryption algorithm involving a single key, ending
the patent infringement problem may not have been as easy at it first seemed.
The text key is encrypted using the processing-intensive RSA public key
scheme. The problem is that for the text encryption stage, RSADSI chose the
DES algorithm instead of the IDEA algorithm used in PGP.
DES was not perceived as a problem cipher until August of this year, at a
cryptographers' trade show called Crypto 93. A respected Bell Northern
Research scientist named Michael Weiner dropped a bombshell on the conference
by asserting, in essence, that DES was dead, as a dependably secure
encryption algorithm. Weiner had designed a high-speed "inside-out" DES
processor chip that could test 50 million keys per second, and serve as a the
basis for a highly effective DES-cracking machine. He had also priced
production of the chip with a chip fabricator, and in large but not enormous
quantities it would cost about $10.50 per chip. Using these figures, he said
a computer with 7,000 such chips would cost a vast amount, and could find the
key to any DES-encrypted message within 7 hours by testing every possible key
within that time, with a mean key-cracking time of 3.5 hours per encrypted
message. For $100 million, well within intelligence agency budgets, a
computer could be built that would crack the keys for DES-encrypted messages
at a clip of two minutes per key. This result would be achieved for texts
encrypted with 56 bit DES keys, where the decryptor has a little bit of plain
text he knows would be in the encrypted message, such as someone's name, or a
word or two. There are DES encryption schemes using longer keys, but the 56
bit key is the U.S. government standard, and the official or de facto
standard in many industry applications as well.
Weiner's brute force approach would be marvelously effective despite its lack
of elegance. For PEM computer programs using RSAREF in its current form,
there can no longer be dependable privacy. All texts encrypted using RSAREF's
standard 56 bit DES approach will, from this point forward, be vulnerable to
cracking at some point by a Weiner-type supercomputer. It will be pointless
to hide the DES key inside RSA encryption. Owners of the supercomputer could
find the key directly from the text, and need not bother with the encrypted
key. As Phil puts it, the RSA encryption of the DES key is like those little
secure boxes for holding front-door keys that realtors mount on houses being
shown to prospective buyers. The little box may be nearly impossible to break
into without the proper code, but there's always another possibility for
getting into the house without permission: break down the door or smash in
the window.
There's a way to avoid this with RSAREF, by invoking deeper subroutines in
the package to create PEM programs that use text encryption schemes more
dependable than the suddenly-reduced DES, such as the IDEA algorithm used
today in PGP. IDEA uses a 128 bit key instead of the 56 bit key standard in
DES, and its security has not been seriously questioned to date, despite
spirited attacks by some of the world's mightiest cryptographers.
Unfortunately, the current RSAREF public license only permits programmers to
use the high-level routines that require DES, and prohibits using the deeper
routines to bring in other encryption algorithms - the very use necessary for
PGP to remain dependably secure. However, after the Weiner revelation, RSAREF
will not be in much demand if it continues to restrict PEM programmers to 56
bit DES. Accordingly, it is rumored that a public license to the deeper,
roll-your-own algorithm subroutines in RSAREF may soon be forthcoming from
RSADSI. If this new license is issued, Zimmermann may finally be home free in
his quest to create a free, effective PGP with no specter of patent
infringement hovering over it. It is possible that by the end of this year or
early in the next, we will see both a commercial ViaCrypt PGP, and a free PGP
for personal noncommercial use.
That's the good news. The bad news is that Phil Zimmermann is now the target
of an investigation by the U.S. attorney's office into violations of the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR. ITAR is a set of laws
administered by the State Department, designed to keep war-grade weapons from
being exported out of the U.S. to certain foreign countries. While ITAR
mainly regulates weapons-like parts for tanks, jets and submarines, it also
regulates encryption devices, including encryption software, as "munitions"
due to their military intelligence value. The U.S. attorney is not commenting
at this early stage, but observers agree the investigation relates to PGP's
worldwide distribution through the Internet. This distribution constituted a
clean end run around the State Department's normal procedure of placing a
roadblock against all cryptography exports, until they are reviewed by the
National Security Agency for military potential. What is unclear, is whether
Zimmermann did anything wrong by placing PGP on the Internet on computers
located within the U.S.
There are very good reasons for saying that Zimmermann's actions were totally
legal, and that he should not have this cloud over his head. For one thing,
Zimmermann did not intend for PGP to be exported. He was never motivated to
put out an international encryption standard. To the contrary, his motivation
was the perception that political forces within the U.S. seemed to be pushing
towards outlawing private encryption in this country. In fact, he acted
specifically to put PGP into circulation quickly while it was still legal in
this country, before any laws might go into place prohibiting domestic use of
privately developed encryption software.
For another, Internet users outside the U.S. helped themselves to PGP.
Zimmermann did not send PGP anywhere outside the country. He made it
available on computers within U.S. borders, which is perfectly legal in
itself. By analogy, I could legally go door-to- door in this country selling
devices enabling people to encrypt their telephone discussions. I can even
leave an open box of them in front of my house in New Jersey, and tell all my
neighbors to pick one up for their own use. If some foreign tourists take a
few and spirit them back into their own countries, why should I be held
guilty for export violations?
In addition, Zimmermann and all the users of PGP in this country have their
First Amendment rights. Zimmermann has the right to freely publish the PGP
program in this country. The Constitution says Congress will enact "no law"
restricting freedom of speech and of the press. There are no Amendments to
the Constitution that contain exceptions for speech or press distributed
through the Internet. Additionally, people who send electronic messages to
each other have the right to send them encrypted without government
interference, and legal action against PGP would certainly interfere with
such activities. In this instance, PGP's free speech rights derive from its
assistance of PGP users in exercising their own rights of free speech. This
kind of derivative free speech protection is very powerful. It is analogous
to the protection of speech distributors applied in the past by the Supreme
Court and other federal courts to book sellers, magazine distributors, and
even CompuServe.
Finally, there are privacy considerations. This is not really a legal
argument, as much as a question of the limits of appropriate government
intrusion into peoples' private lives. The question comes up almost daily
these days, in settings ranging from the privacy of employee e-mail to the
swelling commercial market for extensive data on each citizen in our country
of consumers. A government push against the availability of PGP, regardless
of the legal cause, would count as yet another blow against the dwindling
ability of us all to retain a modicum of personal privacy. As the cypherpunks
are often heard to say, "if privacy becomes outlawed, only outlaws will have
Powerful as these and other arguments are, they will not deter government
action on their own. The government can offer the fairly standard legal
argument that Zimmermann "knew or should have known," that placing PGP on the
Internet would result in worldwide export in violation of the ITAR. After
speaking with Zimmermann, I am not sure he actually knew, in particular, that
there was a law called ITAR, or that it applied to encryption software. As
mentioned above, he certainly was not out to distribute PGP worldwide.
Whether the government proceeds will depend as much on political factors as
on its view of the legalities involved.
The investigation is at an early stage, and in fact, has not been directed
formally at Zimmermann. The only activity in public view so far was the
service of subpoenas for document production by the U.S. Attorney's office in
San Jose, CA on Viacrypt in Phoenix, AZ and another company named Austin Code
Works in Austin, TX. Austin Code Works distributes PGP and other free
software for encryption and other uses in source code form, for little more
than the price of a computer disk. According to Zimmermann, he has no
business relationship with Austin Code Works. He also had no idea they were
distributing PGP until he read about the subpoena served on them. As soon as
Austin Code Works was served, its president, Grady Ward, went public on the
Internet with a ringing defense of its position. Ward claims they do not
distribute executable programs, but only "source code algorithmic
descriptions" of encryption techniques, thus falling under a "technical data"
exception to ITAR. The State Department publicly countered that position, and
is requiring Austin Code Works to register as a munitions dealer.
There is no telling whether the investigation will proceed to charges against
Zimmermann or others, but Zimmermann and others in the network community
intend to be prepared. Phil Zimmermann's attorney, Colorado criminal lawyer
Philip Dubois, is accepting contributions for Zimmermann's defense, (He can
be reached at Philip Dubois, Esq., 2305 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80304,
(303)444-3885, dubois The Electronic Frontier Foundation is also
stepping forward in Zimmermann's defense, with financial commitments from EFF
and several of its individual board members, and efforts to rally public
support for Zimmermann and PGP.
A lingering question in the current investigation is why the government
waited over two years after PGP's release to start it up. Some speculate it
is due to a link between the investigation and the government's efforts to
establish a new encryption standard named CLIPPER as the replacement for the
aging DES standard. The government has repeatedly stated it will not seek to
make Clipper the only legal encryption standard in this country by outlawing
all others. But if it proceeds to charge Zimmermann and PGP as a result of
the current investigation, it could have the effect of using the government's
legal artillery to blow away one of Clipper's most prominent competitors.
Speculation aside, PGP's legal situation is slowly maturing, and within
another year or so we should know for sure whether it's legal or illegal in
the U.S. By that time, it will be in the hands of millions of people the
world over, each using PGP to create his or her own private communications
channel. Hopefully, we will not have to witness the ironic spectacle of PGP
being banned in the country of its birth, while freely in use in the rest of
the world.

 EDITORS' NOTES
 ==============
 One Man - One Vote - One Program
The National Information Infrastructure: Agenda for Action document was
released September 12 and made available to the online community in full
ascii text form the same day. This document outlines the administration's
blueprint for a future national data highway. We don't normally devote nine
pages of Boardwatch to publishing government literature. But, while the
document is easily available electronically, this will probably affect
everyone online at some point or another. You will undoubtedly see it quoted
and analyzed in coming months, but I'm going to guess the full text is not
going to be carried widely in print. So we decided to run the whole thing -
albeit as "the fine print."
The NII Agenda is remarkable in that they did manage to assemble every cliche
in the free world regarding online communications and actually pile them all
into one document. As government detritus goes, it is actually quite
readable. A persistent, if effete segment of the online community has
campaigned for some time for government to "get involved" online. They
parade across Washington in a continuous stream attempting to get our
government to fund various notions of what they want the online world to look
And in some areas, government participation in the online process has been
productive. The National Science Foundation has devoted a relatively modest
amount of public investment in the Internet and this money has leveraged a
hundred times that much private investment in the technology. I agree, there
is a role for government in the future network.
But in the context of the other things this administration is trying to do, I
originally approached this topic with some trepidation. These people have no
moral qualms whatsoever in saying one thing and doing quite another. The
concepts of truth and lies and right and wrong are foreign to their view of
the way the world works. The action items regarding encryption and copyright
law revision are worded innocently enough. Beneath those words I detect an
agenda more in keeping with the current health care program proposal, the
budget recently passed, a corps of youth working for the government, the
addition of 50,000 police officers on a national basis, and an entire
political agenda focused quite single mindedly on one thing - control of the
population - at all levels and in areas American's just aren't accustomed to
thinking of as something anyone would want to control.
This document does refer to legislation that would open the local telephone
loop to competition - a concept we first came out for in 1988. The
legislation they refer to basically frees the local telephone companies to
provide video, information, long distance services - it has little to do with
competition in the local loop other than to provide these telephone companies
precisely what they've been lobbying for - freedom to exploit their
monopolies on the local line infrastructure. The players are cable tv
companies and telephone companies. Six months ago telco U.S. West purchased
25% of Time Warner, and this past week, Bell Atlantic and TCI, the nation's
largest cable company holding group, announced a complete merger. The
standoff between cable companies and telephone companies is over - and there
will be LESS competition, not more. The inside deal making all of this work
is that the government becomes a "partner" in developing our
telecommunications infrastructure - the "controlling" influence.
The more pressing current concern is encryption and privacy. The
administration rolled out the Clipper Chip proposal earlier this year as a
toe in the water. Clinton apologists are quick to point out that this was a
Bush administration proposal. Poppycock. There are thousands of proposals
making the rounds in Washington in a continous cloud - the plankton of the
political seascape. A relative handful ever see the light of day. This one,
given little chance under the Bush administration, did under President
The Clipper Chip concept is a bit startling. Everyone gets to encrypt their
data, and in fact are encouraged to do so - with the government holding the
decryption keys. I can't separate the stupid from those accused of stupid
here, so I'll just note that it was proposed, and is still pursued. But they
do apparently feel it important that if anyone has any "secret stuff", the
government should, as a matter of course, have access to it. You have no
"right" to privacy - quite the contrary.
In health care, before it is over, if you want health care coverage, it will
only be available in ONE place - a government office. You will present
yourself in person, along with a little basket of receipts showing you've
paid your taxes, registered for the draft, the national service program,
given blood, quit smoking, have exercised regularly, have your car insurance
in order, your driver's license, social security receipt, and anything else
necessary to "make us safe." And if all your papers are in order, and you pay
the fees, you will receive a little plastic card allowing you to visit a
doctor or clinic. George Orwell never had it so good.
And I would fear this same socialist greed for control of our lives will be
applied to the online community via this National Information Infrastructure.
I would, but I don't, and I'm feeling particularly enchanted right now by why
I don't.
First, they can be counted on to be as buffoonish about it as possible given
the laws of physics. Currently, the State Department is actually pursuing a
lone Boulder programmer with a Grand Jury investigation of possible
infraction of export controls - alleging that he illegally exported a data
encryption program - Pretty Good Privacy. The farce is of course that he
never left Boulder. He posted it on a couple of local Internet sites, and of
course, within about 12 minutes it was all over the world. It allows anyone
to encrypt e-mail messages in such a fashion that all the kings horses and
all the kings men can't figure out what the hell you said in it on a bet.
And this is the heartening jewel. The online world has always moved
powerfully toward the least common denominator grass roots end of the
electronic path. All things that have grown have grown DOWN toward the end
user, not UP toward a central authority. The entire energy in the online
explosion has been OUT and DOWN and many of the innovations have been to
extend functionality to the least equipment, at the least cost, in a never
ending quest for "free" and something I can run on my OWN computer. The
natural conclusion of this will be instant worldwide communication from a
handheld $4 pocket calculator.
The Internet is fascinating in that it is a belief system that allows people
to connect to a common backbone for communications. That was the part we
needed. Something persuasively "in the middle." But it was ALL we needed.
There are now 130 million personal computers out there. And some percentage
of these people are Phil Zimmermanns. This one man, with one wee little
Borland compiler, wrote a piece of software. And whether they prosecute him
to make him an example or not, he released ONE program in the wee hours of
the morning in 1991, that will never allow the government or anyone else to
put the data encryption genie back in the bottle. It did not change the
world. It demonstrated that the world had changed. It's free. It's
everywhere. There is no way to track down all the copies in all the world. It
transcends national boundaries. He did it for the notoriety - and he got it.
But he could have just as easily done it anonymously. An avowed leftist
himself, he really gets just as bristley as Pat Buchanon from the far right
on this thing about government control of individuals. And he's not alone.
Whatever elaborate systems are contrived, at the cost of billions of dollars,
with the full collusion of giant corporate telco/cable entities controlling
vast territories of fiberglass and copper, they will become symbols of vanity
- towers of Babel standing in testimony to the futility of trying to use
electronics to control people. Electronics is a good material for building
freedom, and a most notably poor one for forging chains. Wherever there is
one guy with an attitude, a compiler, and a few free afternoons, all the
plans and all the plots of all the kings go awry with a single program
We have lots of guys with attitudes, lots of compilers, and lots of
Let them build the NII. Let us use it without fear. With a handful of
Zimmermanns, we can remake the world to suit us.
Now, if only we could get Phil to compile us a health care program....

P.S. Mr. Zimmermann, guilty, innocent, free, or jailed, will undoubtedly
incur the usual mountain of legal fees - poor thanks for his contribution.
It might just serve an interesting purpose to make a numeric show of force on
his behalf to demonstrate that the usual economic coercion won't work either.
Stick a lone dollar bill in an envelope and send it to his legal defense
fund. For a buck twenty-nine, it's a cheap political statement. And if
enough of us do it, maybe the world will change again.

Big Brother Wants to Look Into Your Bank Account
(Any Time It Pleases)
The US Government is constructing a system to track all financial
transactions in real-time -- ostensibly to catch drug traffickers,
terrorists, and financial criminals. Does that leave you with the warm
fuzzies -- or scare you out of your wits?
by Anthony L. Kimery
There wasn't much to go on. The police salvaged the slip of paper that
a small-time East Coast drug dealer tried to eat before being
arrested, but on it they found scribbled only a telephone number and
what appeared to be the name "John." This frustrated the police. They
had anticipated more incriminating information on the man they
believed was the supplier not only to the dealer they'd just busted,
but also to dozens of other street corner crack peddlers. With two
slim leads, the police weren't technically equipped to do much more
than antiquated detective work that probably wouldn't yield evidence
they could use to indict John. So they turned to the quasi-secretive,
federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for the digital
sleuthing they needed.
Less than 45 minutes after receiving the official police request for
help, FinCEN had retrieved enough evidence of criminal wrongdoing from
government databases that the district attorney prosecuting the case
was able to seek indictments against John on charges of money
laundering and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. The local police were
Launched with a low-key champagne reception at the Treasury Department
in April 1990, FinCEN is the US Government's (perhaps the world's)
most effective financial crime investigation unit. Even Russian
President Boris Yeltsin asked for its help in locating stolen
Communist Party funds. This state-of-the-art computer-snooping agency
is quietly tucked away under the auspices of the Treasury Department.
Its mission is to map the digital trails of dirty money, be it the
laundered profits from drug sales, stolen S&L loot, hidden political
slush funds, or the financing conduits of terrorists. It's the only
federal unit devoted solely to the systematic collation and
cross-analysis of law enforcement, intelligence, and public databases.
Until August 1993, FinCEN headquarters was an old Social Security
Administration building with a ceiling ravaged by asbestos abatement
crews, but that didn't seem to faze director Brian Bruh (he retired in
October). With 25 years of experience in law enforcement, Bruh is a
seasoned cop who has headed up criminal investigations at both the IRS
and the Pentagon. Prior to overseeing FinCEN, he was the chief
investigator for the Tower Commission, President Reagan's blue ribbon
probe into the Iran-Contra scandal. FinCEN was his crowning
achievement, and he took pride in directing visitors to FinCEN's
computer command center as he touted the agency's successes.
In private and in testimony to Congress, statistics roll off Bruh's
tongue. Last year FinCEN's computer operations center responded to
priority requests for tactical intelligence on nearly 12,000
individuals and entities, doubling the 1991 workload. The 1993 total
will be three times the 1991 sum. Longer-term strategic analytical
reports have been completed for 715 investigations involving 16,000
other individuals and entities.
Two of the government's biggest strikes against organized drug-money
laundering -- operations Green Ice (a lengthy DEA operation that
resulted in the arrests of high-ranking Cali and Medellin cartel
financial officers and the seizure of US$54 million in cash and
assets) and Polar Cap V (a spinoff of Green Ice that culminated in
April 1990) -- owe a great deal to FinCEN for having identified and
targeted money laundering activities via computer. In the Polar Cap
operation, FinCEN's computer tracking documented more than US$500
million in financial activity by 47 individuals who have since been
indicted on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.
Inside FinCEN's new digs on the second floor of a gleaming high-rise
office building down the road from the CIA in Vienna, Virginia
(otherwise know as "Spook City"), the talents of the IRS, FBI, DEA,
Secret Service, and other traditional federal cops such as customs
agents and postal inspectors are pooled. According to senior
intelligence officers, these investigative units can access resources
of the CIA, the National Security Agency (which intercepts data on
electronic currency movements into and out of the United States, some
of which make their way into FinCEN's analyses), and the Defense
Intelligence Agency.
Bruh and other FinCEN officials openly acknowledge their association
with the CIA, but refuse to discuss further any aspect of FinCEN's
dealings with it or any other intelligence agency. In addition to the
CIA, intelligence officials have admitted, of the record, that the
National Security Council and the State Department's Bureau of
Intelligence and Research (INR) have also joined FinCEN's impressive
intelligence crew. In short, FinCEN is a one-of-a-kind cauldron
containing all the available financial intelligence in the United
"FinCEN is absolutely necessary," said a senior General Accounting
Office (GAO) official involved in an audit of FinCEN required by new
anti-money-laundering laws passed last year. The agency's report
wasn't released by press time, but according to the GAO official, no
irregularities were uncovered. However, the GAO's scrutiny skirted
emerging concerns about privacy, civil rights, and the appropriate
role of the intelligence community.
FinCEN's mission _requires_ the involvement of the intelligence
community, particularly in tracking the financial dealings of
terrorists and in conducting financial counterintelligence, although
few are willing to discuss the trend openly. Because these activities
cross into the world od cloaks and daggers, some watchdogs are
concerned that such endeavors will encroach on privacy and civil
rights. When you look at the power of FinCEN and its proposed
offspring, their fears seem justified.
How to Bust a John
The whiz kids at FinCEN are good. Very good. That;s why state and
local police have come to depend on FinCEN to pull them out of the
electronic-sleuthing quicksand. The case of John the drug supplier is
a good example of one of their less-complex assignments, and it
illustrates the adeptness with which the government can collate
existing financial data.
Seated at a computer terminal inside FinCEN's former command post, a
FinCEN analyst began the hunt. He started by querying a database of
business phone numbers. He scored a hit with the number of a local
restaurant. Next he entered the Currency and Banking Database (CBDB),
an IRS database accessed through the Currency and Banking Retrieval
System. CBDB contains roughly 50 million Currency Transaction Reports
(CTRs), which document all financial transactions of more than
US$10,000. By law these transactions must be filed by banks, S&Ls,
credit unions, securities brokers, casinos, and other individuals and
businesses engaged in the exchange of large sums of money.
The analyst narrowed his quest by searching for CTRs filed for
transactions deemed "suspicious." Financial institutions must still
file a CTR, or IRS Form 4789, if a transaction under US$10,000 is
considered suspicious under the terms of an extensive federal
government list. There was a hit. A series of :suspicious" CTRs
existed in the restaurant's ZIP code. Punching up images of the
identified CTRs  on his terminal, the FinCEN analyst noted that the
transactions were made by a person whose first name was John. The CTRs
were suspicious all right; they were submitted for a series of
transactions each in the amount of US$9,500, just below the CTR
threshold of US$10,000. This was hard evidence that John structured
the deposits to avoid filing a Form 4789, and that is a federal crime.
Selecting one of the CTRs for "an expanded review," the analyst got
John's full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address,
driver license number, and other vital statistics, including bank
account number.
Plunging back into the IRS database, the analyst broadened his search
for all CTRs filed on behalf of the suspect, including non-suspicious
CTRs. Only 20 reports deemed suspicious popped up on the screen, but
more than 150 CTRs were filed in all. A review of the non-suspicious
ones revealed that on several, John listed his occupation as the owner
or manager of the restaurant identified by the telephone number on the
slip of paper taken from the arrested drug dealer. The connection
between the name and the phone number originally given to FinCEN was
The FinCEN analyst the tapped commercial and government databases, and
turned up business information on the restaurant showing that John had
reported an expected annual revenue for his eatery of substantially
less than the money he had been depositing, as indicated by the CTRs.
Fishing in a database of local tax assessment records, the analyst
discovered that John owned other properties and businesses. With the
names of these other companies, the analyst went back into the CTR
database and found that suspicious transaction reports were filed on
several of them as well.
As routine as such assignments as this case may be, the chumminess
between FinCEN and the intelligence community raises serious questions
about the privacy and security of the financial records of citizens
John and Jane Doe, considering the intelligence community's historic
penchant for illegal spying on non-criminals. Given the cast reach and
ease with which the government can now tap into an individual's or
business's financial records on a whim, these questions have received
far too little scrutiny.
Whose privacy?
"There are legitimate concerns" regarding privacy, a ranking House
banking committee staffer conceded in an interview with _Wired_.
"Quite frankly, there hasn't been much congressional oversight with
respect to the intelligence community's involvement with FinCEN. When
you start trying look into this, you start running up against all
kinds of roadblocks." The GAO official involved in auditing FinCEN
agreed that questions regarding the intelligence community's
involvement and attendant privacy concerns haven't been addressed. If
such issues have been the subject of discussion behind the closed
doors of the White House and Senate intelligence committees, no one is
talking openly about it. Meanwhile, the potential for abusive intrusion
by government into the financial affairs of private citizens and
businesses is growing almost unnoticed and unchecked.
Two of the latest electronic inroads into the financial records of
private citizens and businesses are "Operation Gateway," a FinCEN
initiative, and the proposed Deposit Tracking System, which other
intelligence agencies would like to see established. Both are
inherently prone to abuse and provide a disturbing indication of the
direction which the government is moving.
Gateway is a pilot program launched in Texas this July that gives
state and local law enforcement officials direct access to the massive
federal Financial Database (FDB) through a designated FinCEN
coordinator. The FDB contains the records that financial institutions
have been filing under the Bank Secrecy Act for the last 25 years --
CTRs, suspicious transaction reports, International Transportation of
Currency or Monetary Instruments reports, and Foreign Bank and
Financial Accounts reports. In addition, Congress is expected to grant
FinCEN authority to tap into the database of Forms 8300, which are
reports of payments over US$10,000 received in a trade or business.
These documents principally contain information on deposits,
withdrawals, and the movement of large sums of currency. It is
FinCEN's intent to give all state governments individual access to the
Under the Gateway proposal, results from all queries would be written
into a master audit file that will constantly be compared against
other requests and databases to track whether the subject of the
inquiry is of interest to another agency or has popped up in a record
somewhere else.
State coordinators designated by the FinCEN will do the logging on, as
FinCEN is uncomfortable with giving 50,000 federal agents and 500,000
police officers direct electronic access to its database. "This is
very sensitive information," concedes Andy Flodin, special assistant
to the FinCEN director. "We'd have to have additional security
safeguards before we could open it up to every police agency."
But while the FDB contains only records on major money movements and
thus is not as much of a threat to individual privacy, the Deposit
Tracking System (DTS) is a potential menace. If implemented, the
estimated US$12.5 million computer system could be used to penetrate
the security of bank accounts belonging to you, me, and 388 million
other bank account holders in the US.
The government argues that such a system is necessary for two reasons:
first, to access adequately the funding needed for federal deposit
insurance and second, to locate the assets of individuals ordered by
courts to make restitution for financial crimes -- like the savings
and loan crooks. (It seems the government can't trace most of the
money they stole.)
The first reason stems from a requirement of the seemingly innocuous
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 -- one
of Congress's legislative responses to the savings and loan debacle.
The Act requires the FDIC to study the costs, feasibility, and privacy
implications of tracking every bank deposit in the United States.
So far the DTS exists only on paper. The FDIC's completed feasibility
study is currently being examined by Congress, but it is unlikely to
act on it before late next year, For the time being, the US$12.5
million price tag seems to be the biggest drawback to its
Concerns about the DTS have been widespread, although it has received
scant attention in the mainstream press. But according to Diane Casey,
executive director of the Independent Bankers Association of America,
the DTS "would fundamentally change the relationships among banks,
consumers, and the government in ways that have implications beyond
banking policy. Our open and democratic society would be changed
profoundly if any agency of the government maintained the scope of
information on private citizens described in this proposal. It raises
questions about our democracy that would have to be addressed by the
highest policy-making levels of government."
The American Bankers Association (ABA) voiced equally serious
concerns. The ABA doubts "whether there are any privacy safeguards
that would be adequate to effectively protect this database from use
by government agencies and, eventually, private parties," an ABA
spokesman explains. "It is inconceivable to the ABA that such a
database could be used only by the FDIC in deposit insurance coverage
investigations. Such a database...would provide a wealth of
information for investigations being conducted by the FBI, the Drug
Enforcement Administration, and the IRS, to name but a few. Like the
baseball diamond in _Field_of_Dreams_, build this database and they
will come. Eventually, whether legally or illegally, they will gain
access to this database."
The FDIC forcefully argued against the DTS in the 234-page draft
report it submitted to Congress in June 1993, but it may not have the
bureaucratic clout necessary to kill the proposal. _Wired_ was told by
intelligence analysts and congressional sources dealing with oversight
of the intelligence community that federal law enforcement and
intelligence agencies are privately clamoring for the system,
apparently disregarding both the privacy issues and the system's
start-up cost (which does not include the additional US$20 million a
year the feasibility study said would be required for facilities, for
salaries and benefits, and for routine hardware and software
Further driving the intelligence agencies's desire for the DTS is the
much-hyped role of economic intelligence gathering, a key focus of the
Clinton administration's reform of the intelligence community.
Agencies like the CIA view the system as a boon to their ability to
monitor foreign financial dealings in the US, according to both
congressional and intelligence sources.
Adding Intelligence to the Equation
Regardless of the form it takes, the sources said, the DTS and any
other financial databases that come down the pike could be easily
interfaced to FinCEN's Artificial Intelligence/Massive Parallel
Processing (AI/MPP) program, a criminal targeting system that will go
online in a few years.
Because laundered money is moved undetected along with the millions of
legitimate computerized wire transfers that occur daily, FinCEN's
computer investigations naturally demand expert systems that can
single the dirty money out of the crowd. FinCEN's current Artificial
Intelligence capability allows it to search the Financial Database for
suspicious, preprogrammed patterns of monetary transactions. While not
very flexible, the system has successfully identified previously
unknown criminal organizations and activities.
But FinCEN has a hush-hush US$2.4 million contract with the US
Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory to develop what
Bruh and other FinCEN officials described as a powerful "money flow
model." Unlike FinCEN's current system, Los Alamos's AI software will
look for unexplained, atypical money flows. Coupled with a massively
parallel computer system, the AI/MPP could perform real-time
monitoring of the entire US electronic banking landscape.
FinCEN's AI capabilities currently exploit the Financial Database for
proactive targeting of criminal activity. The system automatically
monitors the entire FDB database, constantly identifying suspicious
financial activity in supercomputer-aided, rapid-response time. In
addition to the FDB, FinCEN is applying AI to the Criminal Referral
Forms that must be filed with the FinCEN whenever banks, examiners,
and regulators uncover financial activities they suspect are illegal.
In the near future, all of these government databases will be
interfaced by way of AI/MPP technology. "MPP is critical to FinCEN's
ability to analyse (banking) data to its full capacity," Bruh insists.
The pure power od such a "database of databases" terrifies critics.
Though FinCEN and other authorities discount the potential for abuse,
tell that to the CIA. Its charter forbids it from engaging in domestic
surveillance; nonetheless, it spied on Americans for seven consecutive
presidential administrations (it says it finally ceased its internal
spying in the mid-1970s).
FinCEN's AI operation has been employed legitimately with great
success. Perhaps its least-known project was assisting the CIA in
identifying and tracking the flow of money between Iran's
state-sponsored Islamic fundamentalist terrorist organizations and the
men linked to the bombing of the World Trade Center. According to a
Treasury official and confirmed by Anna Fotias, FinCEN's congressional
liaison, FinCEN identified suspicious transaction reports filed by a
bank in New Jersey on wire transfers from Germany to the accounts of
two of the men charged in the bombing. With the bank account in
Germany identified, further AI processing -- utilizing intelligence
from the CIA's DESIST computer system, the world's most extensive
database on terrorists -- identified a company as a front for an
Iranian terrorist group. Coupled with DESIST's data on the two men's
terrorist connections, FinCEN was able to identify a number of
previously unknown conduits of terrorist funding in the US and abroad.
Similarly, FinCEN was crucial in identifying Iraqi assets in the US
that were frozen in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, according
to a Treasury official.
Still, given the CIA's less-than-spotless record, privacy advocates
are likely to find it disturbing that there are some within the walls
of CIA headquarters -- apparently unbeknownst to anyone at FinCEN --
who want to mesh DESIST with FinCEN's eventual AI/MPP ability and with
all the databases FinCEN routinely surveys. The justification for
creating such a system is compelling: More likely than not it would
identify scores of previously unknown financial conduits to
Advocates of a full-time DESIST/FinCEN system carry their argument one
step further: Hooked into the yet-to-be-authorized Deposit Tracking
System, the DESIST/FinCEN system would be able to identify terrorist
financial movements in real-time, thus providing early warning of
potentially imminent terrorist actions. Some within the intelligence
community take it still another step: They would have the system tied
into the private computers that hold credit card transactions "so that
we could have a nearly instant time-tracking capability," according to
one source who works closely with the CIA's Counterterrorist Center.
Conversely, a CIA/FinCEN/DTS endeavor could monitor on a real-time
basis the financial activity of narcotics traffickers, since drug
dealing also is within the purview of the CIA. The agency's
Counternarcotics Center, or CNC, already works closely with FinCEN.
Before the CIA would be allowed to tap into a system as sensitive as
the proposed Deposit Tracking System, it would have to clear plenty of
civil liberties hurdles, not the least of which is the prohibition on
the CIA from gathering intelligence on US citizens. As long as the DTS
itself was shielded from direct access by the CIA, proponents could
argue that the operation was allowable under law. Opponents, on the
other hand, fear that the CIA would find a way to download, copy, or
otherwise secretly access the DTS.
"The risk of the CIA getting its hands on this is serious -- we know
the kind of unscrupulous people who populate the spook world," said a
Washington-area private investigator who conducts many legitimate
financial  investigations for a CIA-linked firm. "This kind of
financial data, when coupled with other information like a person's
credit history, could be used for blackmail, bribery, and extortion,"
said the investigator, who has a military intelligence background.
Bruce Hemmings is a veteran CIA clandestine-services officer who
retired in 1989. Prior to the DTS proposal, he told _Wired_ that the
CIA routinely digs for financial dirt on people from whom the agency
wants specific information. Typically they are foreign intelligence
officers working in the US under a diplomatic guise, and this
financial information is often used as leverage in getting them to
talk. In less civilized venues, this is called blackmail.
DTS could present an inviting mechanism for quieting unwanted dissent
or for defanging an unruly congressional leader bent on exposing some
questionable CIA operation. Although still in its embryonic stage and
in spite of the looming privacy obstacle it will inevitably confront,
FinCEN is seen by many in the government as the catalyst for a
powerful, all-seeing, all-knowing, global, financial-tracking
organization. In fact, FinCEN is already working closely with
INTERPOL, and Bruh's deputy just resigned to head up INTERPOLs US
As the privacy debate heats up, FinCEN's digital dirt-money trackers
go on about their work, hoping they don't have to choose sides if what
they do becomes a fill-blown privacy invasion problem. As Bruh puts
it, "There's tons of crooks out there who are disguising their
criminal profits. FinCEN needs to computerize as much as possible to
be able to identify the really significant criminals and their
The question then becomes, at point does it stop?

       Encryption and the NII, by Jenevra Georgini
As stated in President Clinton's message of November 5, gov-
ernment policy regarding the national information infras-
tructure (NII) shares two significant objectives with the
Writers Union goals.  The Clinton administration seeks to
ensure broad access by adapting the concept of fair use to
the NII, while simultaneously strengthening domestic copy-
right laws and international treaties to protect the
integrity of intellectual property.  Because the network
will span the globe, standards must be coherent and uni-
formly applied in a way that permits industry growth.  A
standard-based regulatory approach posits legal solutions.
Yet standards remain toothless unless implemented by tech-
nology promoting the dual goal of access and integrity.
Encryption technology is one suggested means of embedding
electronic signatures to authenticate digital works.
Encryption was originally developed by the government for
wartime uses.  Now the technology has become available to
private citizens through programs such as RIPEM (public
domain software based on a program developed with federal
funding at MIT) and Philip Zimmermann's PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy, whose underlying algorithm is pirated from the
patented MIT program).  Zimmermann describes his product as
"the *de facto* worldwide standard for encryption and
email."  It can be used to keep message transmissions (such
as downloading works from a net) private while simulta-
neously authenticating the work.  Each use has a public key
and a private key.  Correspondents use the public key to
encrypt a message to that key's owner.  The key owner gives
out or publishes the key as one would give out an address.
Although the public key can unlock the code that the private
key makes and vice versa, knowing the public key doesn't
enable anyone to deduce the private key.  Those who know the
public key can only encrypt messages for sending; they can-
not decrypt the recipient's messages.  The recipient uses
her own private key to decrypt messages sent.  At the same
time, an author making works available online could encrypt
that work with her own private key.  This would provide a
digital "signature" (or perhaps "fingerprint" would be a
better term; signatures can be forged but private keys are
given to only one person).  Anyone wishing to access the
work could use the sender's public key to verify the origin.
The public key could be included on the work's title screen
to facilitate access.  The user could decrypt the private
code by means of the public code enough to ascertain that
the work had been tampered with but not enough to reveal the
private code (analogous to being able to fit a key into a
lock without the door opening.)
The development of micro-sized encryption chips has made
this technology accessible to a broad range of consumers--
including drug dealers, tax evades, and traders in national
secrets.  Of course, the larger and more powerful government
machines can crack any private citizens 140-digit code in a
day.  However, this represents a substantial outlay of gov-
ernment time and resources for very little reward.  As the
number of messages posted on the net increases, forced
decrypting offers ever-diminishing returns.  (Note!  This is
know as the "logic of the net," a digital variation on "the
more the merrier."  It is also referred to by some commenta-
tors as "the fax effect:" owning the only fax in the world
won't do your business much good, but your fax's value
increases every time someone else buys one because you can
now exchange more information.)  Instead of trying to con-
tain the encryption explosion, the government should harness
its energy to protect citizens' privacy and encourage dis-
tribution of works on the net.  Building on encryption to
prevent piracy on the net is the logical next step in beat-
ing defense budget swords into information plowshares.  Leg-
islation should be enacted limiting state and federal
decrypting requirements to the reasonable search and
seizures contemplated by the Fourth Amendment.  No one
should be forced to decrypt their data without due process
of law, including probable cause shown in the form of a
court-ordered search warrant.  The practice of seizing not
only hackers' computers but all electronic equipment in
their possession is a blatant violation of civil rights.
Perhaps, as suggested by leading scholar Laurence tribe, a
new amendment to the Constitution should be enacted to safe-
guard our traditional-rights in the new frontier environ-
Encryption technology has been responsible for startling
(some might say threatening) advances in digital tape infor-
mation retrieval.  Digital Audio Tape (DAT) records music in
sixteen binary digits.  The human ear does not register
sounds down to the sixteenth bit.  Thus, encrypted informa-
tion such as books or programs can be recorded on each six-
teenth bit.  One could play the tape and hear only music
without interference from the other recorded information
because it takes us such a small space.  The encrypted data
would also be invisible to one examining it on a computer
screen.  The only way to tell that there is anything other
than music on the tape is to compare it bit to bit on a com-
puter with a virgin cassette.  Even with the computer's
help, the encrypted data could look exactly like the noise
that typically appears during recording.  In the words of
Tim May, retired Intel physicist, "Anyone carrying a single
music cassette bought in a store could carry the entire com-
puterized files of the Stealth bomber, and it would be com-
pletely and totally imperceptible."  May further related
that information can also be encoded in images: he could
download a photo, insert an encrypted message in the least
significant portion of each pixel (to minimize distortion)
and repost the image without any recognizable difference.
In addition to its possibilities for authenticating works
online, encryption responds to the problem of royalty track-
ing traditionally solved by licensing.  A microchip invented
by entrepreneur Peter Sprague is programmed to decrypt only
as much of its encrypted database as the user pays for.
After browsing a topic menu, the reader selects what infor-
mation she wants.  The program decrypts that information and
counts how many times it has decrypted (or how many bytes in
a per-byte fee structure).  The user is billed accordingly,
to a debit card or even to an electronic account where e-
money takes the place of cash.  Although encryption, like
any other software, is not completely hackproof, methods can
be developed to make piracy much more trouble than it is

"Ten years after Orwell"
10th Chaos Communication Congress, Hamburg, Germany
The Chaos Computer Club invites the global community to
participate in the Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg
and celebrates the tenth anniversary of this convention.
This hackers' meeting, taking place annually at the
end of December, has become a traditional event which is
characterized by a colorful mixture of absolute chaos,
serious discussion and detailed presentation. Computer enthusiasts, scientists from well-known institutions,
lawyers, politicians, artists and, of course, hackers as well
as data-travellers and Internauts from many countries are going
to meet at the 'Eidelstedter Buergerhaus' on December 27th-29th
for an interdisciplinary exchange of data and other experience.
Not only concentrating on technical topics, political and social
issues will be focal points of discussion this year.
After ten years of creative future concepts the time has come
to look for achieved goals and new visions for the future.
This year's list of topics:
The so-called "great peep attack" (a proposed law reform allowing
state authorities to listen in, even in private rooms, in order to
fight organized crime) affects every german citizen and is considered
one of the most important issues of the year.
- What is technically possible?
- What is planned and/or wanted politically?
- How do the right of privacy and ban of encryption software fit together?
Well-informed speakers talk about state-of-the-art technology and legal
limits. Public discussion forums invite you to form your own opinion.
Money always serves for interesting talk:
- How can we improve Electronic Cash?
- How to print your own money
- How to wash it if it's dirty
- How to open electronic cash machines without damaging them
It's up to you to add to this list...
Hardly noticed by the public, the female part of the hacker scene
is growing. Female hackers' activities have become a regular part
of the congress, the workshop on feminine computer handling is
one of the key events. For the first time, there will be a Women Only room with lots of equipment to try out, opportunity to ask and learn as well as to discuss and create.
Other highlights:
Discussions and workshops on
- citizen networks and electronic democracy
- ISDN, MODACOM (german mobile radio data network) and Beepers
- Bluebox versus Telekom
- Electronic Warfare
- Chip- and other cards
- inventory differences
- underground radio stations
- Computer recycling
- lockpicking
- MIME and *ostscript viruses - copyright law and the GNU generation.
Furthermore: the Hackcenter, the Chaos Cafe, the Chaos Archive,
the movie theatre (among others: educational propaganda films
by the former East German Ministry of State Security), a Zerberus BBS,
the Internet-FreePort and lots of other things we forgot to mention.
Feel free to contribute more interesting topics, workshops or

The Data Highway will no doubt be patrolled by a new elite police
force, the "Data Highway Patrol." Patterned after the California Highway Patrol, also known as "CHiPS"
(as in the terrible-but-campy t.v. show of the 1970s), the Data
Highway Patrol will presumably be dubbed the "ClipperCHiPS."
They'll be sent out on their Harley-Davidson cybercycles to check for
discriminatory data packets, for illegal use of encryption technology,
and for "heavy loads" that strain network resources. And occasionally
they'll stop and help a stranded Internetter. They'll have the
top-rated Data Highway show in the 2002-3 season, ironically and
recursively enough.
Will President Reno send them in to raid the Cyber-Waco havens?
Seriously, I haven't been following this group
(alt.politics.datahighway, that is) too closely, after posting early
on to it, as it seemed like the two camps--pro and con--were settling
down to restating their positions. So, sorry if I'm now intruding.
I was writing an essay for the Cypherpunks mailing list on the way
strong crypto will make local gambling laws unenforceable (through
"telegambling," where a casino in the Bahamas, or "somewhere" in
cypherspace, is only a phone call through some digital mixes away). It
became clear to me that the authorities will hardly countenance the use
of the Data Highway---the taxpayer's NII--for such uses. (And a lot of other "interesting" uses I could describe. If
interested, join the Cypherpunks mailing list by sending a request to
"cypherpunks-request  We were featured on the cover of the
second issue of "Wired" and in the Summer, '93 issue of "Whole Earth
Review," etc. An interesting bunch of folks.)
No, the Data Highway won't likely tolerate "sealed loads" that might
be accessing offshore gambling dens, kiddie porn rings, or weapons
secret information markets (not to mention the ever-worrisome
anonymous markets for assasinations...child's play with digital
remailers and digital cash). Not any more than they now accept trucks
carrying loads across state and national borders without the
possibility of inspection. A national data highway will have lots of
rules and regulations for "fair access," for the allowable data
packets that can travel on it, and for taxation of the explosion in
commercial traffic which will inevitably come.
Hence, the Data Highway Patrol.
Or maybe they'll call it the "CyberSpace Patrol."
Personally, I hate government programs. I don't want the government
"helping" with networks, and I don't want a streamlined data highway.
I like the developing system we've got of zillions of cables,
satellites, fiber optics, and the like, With lots of suppliers of
services and lots of rerouting of packets, it makes it real hard to
enforce the kind of restriction cited above.
And that's a good thing.

: "Medusa" (me, others). I gave up long ago trying to convice Larry

: that Nick Szabo is a real person not the same as me, and that several

: with real lives.
That's interesting. Perhaps you would like to enumerate these attempts. Here
are a few I can think of off the top of my head.
I asked J.Gilmore to send me his phone number to ask him about pseudospoofing
by Cypherpunk leaders and he told me that he only gave out his phone number
to his friends. I ask other cypherpunks for phone numbers and they call
it an `invasion of their privacy'. I asked Szabo about his claims in RISKS and he exploded that I was `digitally stalking him.' I got a message
from a Geof Dale (roommate of a college friend) who said generally he could assert that every cypherpunk I had ever wondered about being a pseudonym was a `true name' but refuses to give me his phone number to so I
can ask specific questions. Nick Szabo has also resisted simple requests of mine to verify that `Nick Szabo' is not a pseudonym. I also asked you, a long time ago Mr. May, to state a simple sentence to me in the form `I have never posted under the name J.Dinkelacker'. You refused
to do so. You did say `The assertion that I am J. Dinkelacker is too bizarre
to believe.' Ha, ha, and that time I asked you what sites you have ever posted
from, and your personal knowledge of multiple sites, you emailed my postmaster
and said that I was `harassing' you. Oh, and that contained another reference
to my `violent threats'. You seem to be quite sensitive to quotations like `death is the ultimate form of censorship.' Hee, hee.
The truth is that every attempt I have made to verify certain identities
has failed and led only to more grisly conclusions, such that Cypherpunks have
gone to the length of registering NIC domains and buying out-of-state phone numbers. Do not tell me this is impossible! A businessman friend of mine has a local phone number in NY that forwards to Denver! It seems to me
cypherpunks could use this very readily! (My kingdom goes to anyone who can provide me with the ability to trace the ultimate destination of phone calls in this way, and help uncover the amazing extent of the Cryptoanarchist conspiracy! volunteers desperately needed!)
As for what the paranoid ranter and conspiracy theorist an12070 thinks, who gives a damn? I'm always amazed at top cypherpunks, supposedly interested
in anonymity, attempting to equate me with this email address.
The cypherpunks have made an art, science, and religion of deceiving others
on the Internet and in the media. I do not consider the leaders respectable.
If they were,  they would have long ago answered my honest questions in
a straightforward manner.
And T.C.May is definitely the classic cryptoanarchist! Nice of you to
keep holding onto your infamous signature (now widely discredited) promoting tax evasion, black marketeering, and the overthrow of : Poor deluded Larry takes any such efforts to resolve his delusion as
: _further proof_ of the Grand Conspiracy to drive him crazier than he

No thanks to you.

Owner of many tentacles. Please list all the sites you have ever posted
from, Mr. May. Ooops, that would be an Orwellian Invasion of your privacy.
A McCarthyist Inquisition. Hee, hee. You cryptoanarchists are so silly. I
am having great fun using your techniques of cyberspatial warfare and
against yourselves. I will not relent until top leadership issues unequivocal
statements on your involvement and knowledge of pseudospoofing. Lies like
that by E.Hughes in RISKS, `I have never posted under any other name than
E.Hughes' obviously do not count, although they may fool some people.
I do thank you, Mr. May, for your posting directly on this topic after my
attempts to date have failed. Perhaps you would like to invite your cohorts
on the cypherpunks list including E.Hughes and J.Gilmore to start a cyberspatial attack campaign on this thread the way you infiltrated RISKS
15.27 and 15.28x! I await the fireworks!
The most serious problems with the Cypherpunks may involve deception of
the media. I'm trying to figure this out as we speak. These lies are very
difficult to untangle! volunteers welcome!
oh, BTW Mr. May, when did you decide my first name was Larry and not Lance?
You called me Lance for 10 months or so on the cypherpunks list.
hee, hee. I would give so much to be at the next CA Clique Conspiracy
meeting in a week or two, to see how the leaders masterfully evade all
charges of misbehavior.

Oh, come off it.  Your rants under various names (including your own)
are very similar: in tone and style, in topic, in their universal
fixation on PSEUDOSPOOFING, "top cypherpunks", and "cypherpunk
leaders", in time of night sent to the list, in 0 of
punctuation.  Then we have an12070 quoting from private mail to you --
you tried to weasel by saying you'd "communicated with your
colleague", whom you're now calling a "paranoid ranter".  And just
today you made a blatant foul-up in your rant on drug conspiracies:
Oops.  I find it ironic that for all your rants about PSEUDOSPOOFING,
your practices are the most blatant and long-running example I have
ever encountered.  I would not count your an12070 account as more
than one identity, except that you constantly change the name and
use different ones to contradict others:
   "The Executioner" , says:
   but "S. Boxx"  says:
You may recall that your very first paranoid claim was that Tim May
and Jamie Dinkelacker were the same person.  You were given the phone
numbers of both -- this was before people became nervous about giving
you any personal information.  Did you ever attempt a reality check?
Oh, you mean like:
It's not an answer because he didn't ADMIT to his heinous CRIMES, I

: No, Mr.
: Detweiler, I'm not "pseudospoofing", How do you explain your statements I analyzed in RISKS 15.27, where you
posted to cypherpunks promoting your sophisticated pseudospoofing techniques? Multiple posting sites, countermeasures and contempt for `opponents' who attempt to determine whether your tentacles are who they claim to be.
Frankly, I think you are a baldfaced liar. Are you intellectually challenged
or am I going to have to go root up all the archives to prove it?
You cryptoanarchists are so arrogant. it will be your downfall.

I seem to have missed much of this thread. My news server seems to have
scrolled off all the interesting articles.  I was hoping more cryptoanarchists would show up to call me insane. Quite a pity.
: There's only one in the phone book. Cupertino's not all that : big, and Szabo's a fairly uncommon name. If I were, umm, you : know, in Mr. Detweiler's mental state, this might lead me to : conclude that somebody was lifting "pseudos" from Bay Area : phonebooks, and the one in the directory does not post. I
: don't really care about it enough to call him.
Mr. Criswell, could you describe the difficulty of getting fake names
into a phone book? is this trivial or impossible? This is not to in any way imply that N.Szabo is such an occurence.
I don't know why everyone on the internet gives every single email address
they meet the benefit of the doubt. They all should get the detriment of
the suspicion. But what do I know? I am just a paranoid lunatic who is progressing quite nicely on Prozac and intense psychoanalysis, thank you very much.
Imagine that someone has made an art, science, and religion to pseudospoof.
Why would they do it? because there is immense power behind such a technique.
And minor barriers like phone numbers and phone books would be the first
mediums they corrupt. People trust phone numbers -- they believe that if
you can supply a phone number, you are are not a pseudonym. What is the
basis for this belief? The foundation? Nothing but naive trust that is
easily betrayed by those who have build their lives around deceptions.
Don't care? well, don't blame me when tomorrow you find out that the cryptoanarchists own the largest share of the world mafia, and have succeeded in doing so by coordinating it over the Internet. Even better yet,
let you be tortured by them all your life without ever discovering the
true source of your wretched desperation.

@_subject: End of Year E-Zine Listing 
Once again, we find ourselves facing a new jahre and pondering
the untold wonders of the anarchy of cyberspace!
In celebration of this joyous occasion, I've decided to post a compilation of electronic 'zines for your perusal.
I especially like the reference for Practical Anarchy and will
probably send a copy of this message to our old chum, Larry
"the squid" Detweiler.
- Spooge
Last updated: 27-Aug-93 by John Labovitz This is a summary of electronically-accessible zines.  The format should be fairly self-explanatory.  In most cases, descriptions are excerpted from the masthead of the zine listed.
[For those of you not acquainted with the zine world, "zine" is short for either "fanzine" or "magazine," depending on your point of view.  Zines are generally produced by one person or a small group of people, done mostly for fun, and often irreverent, bizarre, and/or esoteric.  Zines are not "mainstream" publications -- they generally do not contain advertisements (except, sometimes, advertisements for other zines), do not have a large subscriber base, and are not produced to make money.]
If you have any additions, deletions, or changes to this list, please email
them to johnl
I will post this list (and/or changes to the list) to various mailing lists and Usenet news groups.  It can also be obtained via anonymous FTP from netcom.com as "/pub/johnl/zines/e-zine-list", and via email (either single issues or subscriptions) from e-zines-request
If you publish an e-zine, or know someone who does, please send a copy to e-zines and I'll add the relevant info to this database.

Hello world, I am not proud of everything I have posted `out there' lately,
but I am even less proud of the ugly depths and grotesque deformities
I have seen in certain black corners of the Internet lately, and the
apalling complacency with which you all view it. The skeletons
have not only fallen out the the closet, they have danced around us and
punched us all in the face. My own letters on the subject are an attempt to
shock you from your silent complacency and `accessorizing'. What happens when trust breaks down? What happens when people respond to their own posts? When they misattribute writing? When they don't care who is behind email addresses, or deceive others about them? When they post multiple messages from different addresses? Imagine that every one of my posts came from a different address.
What is to prevent me? My honesty? My integrity? What if I am a cyberanarchist? Would I be horrified or delighted at these embezzlements of trust? By the squirming and writhing of my victims underneath my crushing onslaught?
* * * I was reading a book about ancient torture techniques. (Actually, it was
about something else, but some paragraphs on the subject crept in from
obvious relevance.) The Roman soldiers had invented some of the most grisly torture and execution
techniques the world has ever seen, perhaps the most humiliating and heinous
punishments known to man. One that I was reading about was called `Circle of Eight'. A blindfolded prisoner stands as Roman soldiers (enthusiastic volunteers?) circle him and take turns punching him in the face. They take the blindfold off, and ask him, who hit you? And if the prisoner fails to name the person, the game continues, they dance in their delight, circling at a faster, more dizzying rate, and pummel harder.
What is the point of all this? I don't have a major point, except to suggest that this is one of the most evil abominations of humanity I can
imagine. And that it is shockingly identical to the mentality that a cyberanarchist has in hammering others with his fake email identity arsenals. Medusa is delighted to punch the blindfolded victim in the face with
her dizzying circle of tentacles. Guess who it is! Ooops, you're wrong,
sorry. PUNCH. What? No, N.Szabo is a real person. PUNCH. Pseudospoofing
is immoral? nah. PUNCH. N.Szabo is my roommate. PUNCH. Lies are liberating. PUNCH. cypherpunks have never pseudospoofed. PUNCH. especially the leaders. PUNCH. and everything in the media is true.
PUNCH. especially what we say. PUNCH. and our leaders are the greatest of all. PUNCH.
See the blood dripping on the ground, see the hideous disfigurement of
the victim's face.
* * *
I am posting this many messages to drive home the point that
the Cyberanarchists are not really noble at all. They are like Roman Soldiers who will hit you when they see that you are blindfolded. Otherwise,
they hide in the shadows like all the rest of the cowardly slime at the putrid, dank recesses of humanity. And unless someone takes out the trash, we're going to have to get used to the smell. But where will we go to eat, then?
go ahead, tentacles, water down my words with more trash. dilute and warp my message beyond all recognition. that's probably all we read is, anyway.
all of history is just a big lie set out by people who aren't interested
in the truth, but in fooling us to assuage their egos. the Bible, of course,
is the worst of all.
* * *
I read one author who suggested that as part of Christ's torture before
literally bearing his cross, he had been subjected to the Circle of Eight.
Cyberanarchists, who are you punching? What was that saying of Christ's, as you do unto the lowest of men, you do unto me?
I think the question you have to ask yourselves is, if a victim is blindfolded, does God hear his screams? What if the soldiers are athiests?
When does the Circle of Eight stop, anyway? When the victim is unconscious? When he is dead?

THE INTERNET CODE RING!
An Interview with Phil Zimmerman, creator of PGP
We were sitting in a circle on the floor at the Computers, Freedom, and Privacy conference, March '93 in San Francisco, St. Jude and I with Tom Jennings, Fen La Balme, et al, discussing encryption and other neophiliac rants when a dapper fellow wandered by with a beard on his face and a tie hanging from his neck. He picked up Jude's copy of bOING-bOING number 10 and glanced through it, clearly interested. I later learned that this was Phil Zimmerman, creator of PGP ("Pretty Good Privacy"), so I tracked him down and we talked for the record.
Jon: I'm fairly nontechnical, and I'm also new to encryption. I spent some time recently on the cypherpunks' list, and I have a pretty good sense of what's going on, but maybe you can tell me in your own words how you came to write PGP, and what your philosophy is, especially with distribution.
Phil: Well, okay. PGP, which means "Pretty Good Privacy" is a public key encryption program, it uses a public key encryption algorithm, which means that you can encrypt messages and you can send them to people that you've never met, that you've never had a chance to exchange keys with over a secure channel. With regular encryption, the kind that everybody has heard about, you encrypt a message, it scrambles it up, renders it unintelligible, and then you send it to someone else, and they can descramble it, decrypting it. They have to use the same key to decrypt it as you used to encrypt it. Well, this is a problem, this is inconvenient, because how are you going to tell them what that key is, what're you going to do, tell them over the telephone? If someone can intercept the message, they can intercept the key. So this has been the central problem in cryptography for the past couple of millenia. There's been a lots of different ways of encrypting information, but they all have this need any cryptography at all? So, in the late 1970s, somebody came up with an idea for encrypting information with two keys. The two keys are mathematically related. You use one of the keys to encrypt the message, and use the other key to decrpyt the message. As a matter of fact, the keys have a kind of yin-yang relationship, so that either one of them can decrypt what the other one can encrypt. So everybody randomly generates a pair of these keys, the keys are mathematically related, and they can be split apart like cracking a coin in half, and the jagged edges stick together just right. They can publish one of the keys, and keep the other one secret. Now, unlike cracking the coin in half, you can't look at the jagged edge, and figure out what the other jagged edge is going to look like. In fact, you can't look at the published key and figure out what the secret key is without spending centuries of supercomputer time to do it. This means that any time anybody wants to send you a message, they can encrypt that message with your public key, and then you can decrypt the message with your secret key. If you want to send them a message, then you can encrypt the message with their public key, and then they can decrypt it with their secret key. Everybody who wants to participate in this system can generate a pair of these keys, publish one of them, and keep the other one secret. Everybody's published key can end up in a big public key directory, like a phone book, or an electronic bulletin board, or something like that. You can look up somebody's public key, encrypt a message to them, and send it to them. They're the only ones that can read it, because they're the only ones that have the corresponding secret key. J: Are there any such directories now?
P: Well, actually, there are starting to be directories like that. For PGP, there are some public key directories on Internet. You can just send an electronic inquiry saying "Give me the key for [somebody]," and it'll send you their key back, their public key. J: The convention I've seen has been the inclusion of the public key in an email message posted to a mailing list.
P: You can do that, you can include your own public key when you send a message to someone, so that when they send you a reply, they'll know what public key to use to send the reply. But the problem...there is an achilles heel with public key cryptography, and I'll get to that in a minute. But first, let me explain authentication. If I want to send you a message, and prove that it came from me, I can do that by encrypting it with my own secret key, and then I can send you the message, and you can decrypt it with my public key. Remember I said that the keys are in this yin-yang relationship, so that either one can decrypt what the other one encrypts. If I don't care about secrecy, if I only cared about authentication, if I only wanted to prove to you that the message came from me, I could encrypt the message with my own secret key and send it to you, and you could decrypt it with your public key. Well, anyone else could decrypt it to, because everyone has my public key. If I want to combine the features of secrecy and authentication, I can do both steps: I can encrypt the message first with my own secret key, thereby creating a signature, and then encrypt it again with your public key. I then send you the message. You reverse those steps: first you decrypt it with your own secret key, and then you decrypt that with my public key. That's a message that only you can read and only I could have sent. We have secrecy and authentication. So you get authentication by using your own secret key to decrypt a message, thereby signing the message. You can also convince third parties like a judge that the message came from me. That means that I could send you a financial instrument, a legal contract or some kind of binding agreement. The judge will believe that the message did come from me, because I am the only person with the secret key, that could have created that message.
achilles heel is that, suppose you want to send a message to someone, and you look up their public key, on a bulletin board, for example. You take their public key and you encrypt the message and then send it to them, and presumably only they can read it. Well, what if Ollie North broke into that BBS system? And he subsituted his own public key for the public key of your friend. And left your friend's name on it, so that it would look like it belonged to your friend. But it really wasn't your friend's public key, it was Ollie's public key that he had created just for this purpose. You send a message, you get the bulletin board to tell you your friend's public key, but it isn't your friend's public key, it's Ollie's public key. You encrypt a message with that. You send it, possibly through the same bulletin board, to your friend. Ollie intercepts it, and he can read it because he knows the secret key that goes with it. If you were particularly clever, which Ollie North isn't because we all know that he forgot to get those White House backup tapes deleted...but suppose he were clever, he would then re-encrypt the decrypted message, using the stolen key of your friend, and send it to your friend so that he wouldn't suspect that anything was amiss. This is the achilles' heel of public key cryptography, and all public key encryption packages that are worth anything invest a tremendous amount of effort in solving this one problem. Probably half the lines of code in the program are dedicated to solving this one problem. PGP solves this problem by allowing third parties, mutually trusted friends, to sign keys. That proves that they came from who they said they came from. Suppose you wanted to send me a message, and you didn't know my public key, but you know George's public key over here, because George have you his public key on a floppy disk. I publish my public key on a bulletin board, but before I do, I have George sign it, just like he signs any other message. I have him sign my public key, and I put that on a bulletin board. If you download my key, and it has George's signature on it, that constitutes a promise by George that that key really belongs to me. He says that my name and my key got together. He signs the whole shootin' match. If you get that, you can check his signature, because you have his public key to check. If you trust him not to lie, you can believe that really is my public key, and if Ollie North breaks into the bulletin board, he can't make it look like his key is my key, because he doesn't know how to forge a signature from George. This is how public key encryption solves the problem, and in particular, PGP solves it by allowing you to designate anyone as a trusted introducer. In this case, this third party is a trusted introducer, you trust him to introduce my key to you. promoted by the U.S. Government based on a standard called Privacy Enhanced Mail, or PEM. PEM's architecture has a central certification authority that signs everybody's public key. If everyone trusts the central authority to sign everyone's key, and not to lie, then everyone can trust that they key they have is a good key. The key actually belongs to the name that's attached to it. But a lot of people, especially people who are libertarian-minded, would not feel comfortable with an approach that requires them to trust a central authority. PGP allows grassroots distributed trust, where you get to choose who you trust. It more closely follows the social structures that people are used to. You tend to believe your friends. J: Did you make a conscious decision up front, before you started programming PGP, that you were going to create something that would be distributed in this grassroots way, free through the P: Well, there were some software parts of PGP that I developed some years ago, as far back as 1986, that I developed with the intention of developing commercial products with it someday. Over the years that followed, I developed a few more pieces that I hoped someday to turn into a commercial product. But, when it finally came down to it, I realized that it would be more politically effective to distribute PGP this way. Besides that, there is a patent on the RSA public key encryption algorithm that PGP is based on. I wrote all of the software from scratch. I didn't steal any software from the RSA patent holders. But patent law is different from copyright law. While I didn't steal any software from them, I did use the algorithm, the mathematical formulas that were published in academic journals, describing how to do public key cryptography. I turned those mathematical formulas into lines of computer code, and developed it J: Did you originally intend to license that?
P: When I first wrote the parts of it back in 1986, I did. But I began in earnest on PGP in December of 1990. At that time, I had decided that I was going to go ahead and publish it for free. I thought that it was politically a useful thing to do, considering the war on drugs and the government's attitude toward privacy. Shortly after I stared on the development, I learned of Senate Bill 266, which was the Omnibus Anticrime Bill. It had a provision tucked away in it, a sense of Congress provision, that would, if it had become real hard law, have required manufacturers of secure communications gear, and presumably cryptographic software, to put back doors in their products to allow the government to obtain the plain text contents of the traffic. I felt that it would be a good idea to try to get PGP out before this became law. As it turned out, it never did pass. It was defeated after a lot of protest from civil liberties groups and industry J: But if they could get away with passing it, they would still take the initiative and try.
P: Well, yeah, actually...it started out as a sense of Congress bill, which means that it wasn't binding law. But those things are usually set to deploy the political groundwork to make it possible later to make it into hard law. Within a week or so after publishing PGP, Senate Bill 266 went down in defeat, at least that provision was taken out, and that was entirely due to the efforts of others, I had nothing to do with that. PGP didn't have any impact, it turned out, at all. So that's why I published PGP.
J: Several of my friends are involved in cypherpunks, and I've been on their mailing list...are you affiliated in any way with cypherpunks? Are you getting their mailing list?
P: I was on their mailing list for a couple of days, but I found that the density of traffic was high enough that I couldn't get any work done, so I had them take me off the list.
J: The reason I bring cypherpunks up is that they seem to have almost a religious fervor about encryption . I was wondering if you share that.
P: I don't think of my own interest in cryptography as a religious fervor. I did miss some mortgage payments while I was working on PGP. In fact, I missed five mortgage payments during the development of PGP, so I came pretty close to losing my house. So I must have enough fervor to stay with the project long enough to miss five mortgage payments . But I don't think it's a religious fervor.
J: I'm impressed with the way encryption in general and PGP in particular have caught on with the press, how it's become within the last year.
P: Well, PGP 1.0 was released in June of '91. It only ran on MS DOS, and it didn't have a lot of the features necessary to do really good key certification, which is that achilles' heel that I told you about. Theoretically, you could use it in a manual mode to do that, but it wasn't automatic like it is in PGP 2.0 and above. The current release of PGP is 2.2. It's a lot smoother and more polished that 2.0 was. 2.0 was tremendously different than 1.0, and the reason the popularity has taken off so much since September, when it was released, is because it ran on a lot of UNIX platforms, beginning with 2.0. Since the main vehicle for Internet nodes is UNIX platforms, that made it more popular in the UNIX/Internet world. Since Internet seems to be the fertile soil of discourse on cryptography, the fact that PGP 2.0 began running on UNIX platforms has a lot to do with it's popularity since that version was released...Tthat was in September of '92.
J: The easiest way to get PGP is through FTP from various sites?
P: Yeah. Most of them European sites. PGP 2.0 and above was released in Europe. The people that were working on it were out of reach of U.S. patent law...and not only are they out of reach of patent law, but it also defuses the export control issues, because we're importing it into the U.S., instead of exporting it. Also PGP 1.0 was exported, presumably by somebody, any one of thousands of people could have done it...but it was published in the public domain. It's hard to see how something like that could be published, and thousands of people could have it, and it could not leak overseas. It's like saying that the New York Times shouldn't be exported, how can you prevent that when a million people have a copy? It's blowing in the wind, you can't embargo the wind.
J: And by beginning in Europe, you sort of fanned the flame that much better.
P: Yeah.
J: It seems to have spread globally, and I'm sure that you're hearing a lot about it, getting a lot of response.
P: Particularly at this conference (CFP93), yes.
J: Do you plan to do more development of PGP, or are you satisfied with where it is....
P: PGP will be developed further. My personal involvement is more in providing design direction and making sure that the architecture stays sound. The actual coding is taking place overseas, or at least most of it is. We do get patches sent in by people in the U.S. who find bugs, and who say, "I found this bug, here's a patch to fix it." But the bulk of the work is taking place outside the U.S. borders. J: Is there a Mac version as well as a DOS version now?
P: Yeah, there is a Mac version...there was a Mac version released shortly after PGP 2.0 came out. Somebody did that independently, and I only found out about it after it was released. People have written me about it, and it did seem to have some problems. The same guy who did that version is doing a much improved version, Mac PGP version 2.2, which I believe should be out in a few days...that was the last I heard before I came to the conference. The second Mac development group, that's working on a very "Mac"-ish GUI, is being managed by a guy named Blair Weiss. That takes longer, it's difficult to write a good Mac application, so it's probably going to be a couple of months before that hits the streets. J: Were you involved in the UNIX version, too?
P: I did the first MS-DOS version entirely by myself, but it's not that big a distance between MS-DOS and UNIX, so most of it was the same. The UNIX board took place soon after PGP 1.0 was released. After that, many other enhancements were added, and major architectural changes took place to the code, and that's what finally made its way out as version 2.0.
J: You're doing consulting now?
P: That's how I make my living, by consulting. I don't make anything from PGP.
J: Do you think you'll just let PGP take a life of its own, let other people work on it from here out?
P: Other people are contributing their code, and other people are adding enhancements, with my design direction. Perhaps someday I'll find a way to make money from PGP, but if I do, it will be done in such a way that there will always be a free version of PGP available. J: I was thinking of the UNIX thing, where everybody's modified their versions of the UNIX Operating System so that some [customized versions] weren't even interoperable. I was wondering if there was a chance that PGP would mutate, whether you're going to keep some sort of control over it, or whether people will start doing their onw versions of it....
P: Well, I don't know, that could happen. There are so many people interested in the product now, it's hard to keep track of everybody's changes. When they send in suggested changes, we have to look at it carefully to see that the changes are good changes.
J: But you don't have some sort of structure in place where you do some kind of approval if somebody wants to make some kind of mutant version of PGP....
P: There is a kind of de facto influence that I have over the product, because it's still my product, in a kind of psychological sense. In the user population, they associate my name with the product in such a way that, if I say that this product is good, that I have looked at this and that I believe the changes made sense the last version are good changes, that people will believe that. So I can determine the direction, not by some iron law, not by having people work for me that I can hire and fire, but more by my opinion guiding the product. It would not be easy for a person to make a different version of PGP that went in a different direction than how I wanted it to go, because everybody still uses the version that I approved, so to be compatible...this has a kind of intertia to it, a de facto standard. PGP currently, I believe, is the world's most popular public key encryption program, so that has potential to become a de facto standard. I don't know what that means in comparison to the PEM standard. PEM is for a different environment than PGP, perhaps, although the PGP method of certifying keys can be collapsed into a special case that mimics in many respects the PEM model for certifying keys.

Outlook; Commentary and Opinion
The Pentagon's Secret Garden
With Inman's Arrival, Will The 'Black Budget' Grow?
by Bill Sweetman
Bobby Ray Inman, defense secretary-designate, is not merely the
first career military man to hold that position. He is also a
lifetime intelligence professional, with a background in
cryptography -- which, apart from the operation of covert agents
in hostile territory, is the most jealously guarded of all
intelligence activities. When Inman ran the National Security
Agency, it was a felony to disclose that the multibillion-dollar
agency existed.
Inman will not find himself lonely in this latest of the several
administrations in which he has served. Indeed, the rapid tapping
of Inman to replace Les Aspin follows other signs that the
Clinton administration shares the previous regime's enthusiasm
for secret weapons and covert operations.
Since the Berlin Wall came down, the Pentagon has lifted the
curtain an inch on a couple of secret projects (a Stealth ship
and a tactical missile) but dozens remain hidden -- including,
probably, the 4,000-mph spy plane called Aurora and other exotic
Inman's rise parallels the growth of the secret military, the
so-called "black world" that exists within the Pentagon and the
defense industry. Although estimates vary, it is likely that more
than $15 billion of the Pentagon's annual research, development
and production budget is spent on secret projects: about 16
percent of the total and much more than most countries spend to
equip their entire armed forces.
Secrecy costs billions. The fortified buildings, guards and the
vetting bureaucracy are only the start. Newly hired people spend
weeks doing nothing, waiting for their clearances. The cost of
shuttling workers from Las Vegas and California into remote sites
is enormous. Documents and data must be tracked with maniacal
care from the printer to the shredder. Ben Rich, former chief of
the Lockheed Skunk Works, reckons that the toughest "special
access" security rules add 10 to 15 percent to the cost of a
project, implying that the Pentagon spends $1.5 billion or more
per year on enforcing those rules.
The Soviet Union has come apart. Iraq was defeated using
(apparently) unclassified technology. If the black world has
invented anything newer and more exotic -- which it certainly
should have done, with all that money -- America's future
adversaries will probably not be able to do much about it even
if they know it exists.
When the Senate holds hearings on the Inman nominations later
this month, it will no doubt wish to consider more than the
defense secretary-designate's tax liabilities, "comfort level"
with the president or even his prior record in the service of his
country. One question in particular that should be asked of Inman
is, quite simply: From whom, exactly, is the black world still
keeping secrets?
Whether we will get an answer is uncertain. Inman is, as a former
intelligence officer notes, "steeped in the cult of
intelligence." He was the first intelligence professional to be
appointed special assistant to the chief of naval operations. He
is one of only two Navy intelligence men to be made full
admirals. He has been head or deputy chief of four intelligence
agencies: NSA, CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the
Office of Naval Intelligence.
In the early Reagan years, Inman's differences with his boss at
the CIA, Bill Casey, have been attributed to Casey's covert
operations. The codebreaker Inman, by contrast, leans toward
"technical means" of intelligence-gathering: satellites and
massive computer data banks.
Inman's links to James Guerin, the now-jailed arms
wheeler-dealer, and to Guerin's failed International Signal &
Control (ISC) conglomerate, provide interesting fodder for Aurora
observers. Inman went from the CIA to ISC as a member of an
independent proxy board responsible for ensuring that no military
secrets passed from ISC's U.S. subsidiaries to its non-U.S.
headquarters. In 1992, Inman wrote a letter to the sentencing
judge attesting to Guerin's "patriotism," and other ISC
defendants have claimed that the company's actions were
influenced by the CIA.
Although ISC is usually described as a maker of cluster bombs,
one of its major subsidiaries was the Marquardt Company. Now owned
by Kaiser, Marquardt is the most experienced U.S. developer and
producer of ramjets -- engines exclusively used for hypersonic
aircraft and missiles.
Inman, of course, got his first high-level job, the NSA
directorship, from Jimmy Carter. It was Carter, not Reagan, who
started the black world's expansion; and when Inman arrives at
the Pentagon he will find, in the next-door office, William J.
Perry, the Carter appointee who was most closely associated with
the black world's growth.
In 1976, before Perry was undersecretary of defense for research
and engineering, the Stealth project was not even classified.
Perry, who earned the title of "the godfather of Stealth," was
instrumental in the decision to fast-track Stealth into service,
over the doubts of many service chiefs -- and to bury in the
Pentagon basement. The new administration promptly removed the
project from the civilian-headed Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency and gave it to the Air Force, which concealed its
By 1978, Lockheed had a contract for an operational stealth
fighter, the F-117, and the Air Force was writing requirements
for a Stealth strategic bomber, to become the B-2. Although
fighter and bomber projects had never been secret in peacetime,
Carter's Pentagon hid both of them.
After Reagan's inauguration in 1981, Perry was the only senior
Carter appointee to remain at the Pentagon, serving for several
months as an advisor to incoming Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger and helping to get the B-2 project rolling.
Perry, who returned to the Pentagon in January 1993 as Clinton's
deputy defense secretary, should have a comfortable relationship
with Inman, for Perry has long-standing connections to the secret
world. In 1964, Perry helped found ESL Inc. (now part of TRW), to
develop and produce the electronic eavesdropping equipment that
provided Inman and his codebreaking colleagues with their raw
material. Perry was ESL's president until he went to Washington
in 1977.
Perry and Inman are not the only Clinton appointees with
black-world credentials. Air Force Secretary Sheila E. Widnall
was, for six years, a trustee of the Aerospace Corp., a unique
half-billion-dollar-per-year nonprofit organization that provides
management and technical support to the Air Force space program

Noone persists in the belief that absolutely no "psuedospoofing" is
occurring on Cypherpunks. What is patently obvious, however, is that
Detweiler makes wild and unsubstantiated charges against others. Please send
me a small selection of his 1000 messsages that he feels prove
the charges he has been making. Otherwise, let him keep his delusions to
himself. His behaviour concerning these absurd claims that
Tim May and Eric Hughes (neither of whom I have met) are criminals
is completely unacceptable to reasonable people. I urge Detweiler to
bring forth proof or shut up.
Has he ever considered how sociopathic it is for him to whine
about how painful a particular letter or article is to him and yet
he never seems to care about the hurt he's causing with his
apparently groundless charges concerning TC May, Eric Hughes, and
Cypherpunks list members in general ????

Mr. Detweiler, I would claim that you have the brain of a cabbage, but
obviously you've expended a fair quntity of intellect figuring out this
tremendous conspiracy of cryptoanarchists and their devious leaders
attempting to sink you (if they're anarchists, how can they have leaders
Dozens of people have stated that they have met all the people you
think are the same. You are living in a self-consistant delusion --
there is no way to demonstrate to your satisfaction that your claims
are false, because you won't accept testimonial evidence and you wont
go through any effort to check out the evidence you have been given
that you can check out yourself. There is no amount of effort that
will convince you of the truth. Meanwhile, you continue to post huge
disruptive messages about topics 99% of the net doesn't care about
both under your name and under "an12070 to dozens of
newsgroups. I'd say if anyone around here is a problem its YOU.
Nick Szabo is a real human being, last I checked.   He was a computer
science major at U.W. and later worked at JPL in Pasadena.  He shared a
basement apartment with a Tibetan holy man.  While he was about as odd
as any other hardcore C-Sci guy I know of, he's a lousy candidate to be
a leader, a tentacle, or any other part of a massive cryptoanarchist
This won't dissuade you (obviously, I'm just another member of the
conspiracy.  My tenous link with Nick proves it for a fact.  In fact,
Jeremy Anderson is just an alias!  I picked up the driver's license,
credit cards, passport, and personality dossier 8 years ago in Tiajuana
from a shadowy man known only as "rodriguez, with two lower case r's".)
Let's try a different tact.
Yes Detweiler.  You have sucessfully exposed the international
cryptoanarchist conspiracy.  Unfortunately, our vast experience with
media manipulation and our connections with the highest levels of
government will hamper your ability to make further progress.  We are
proud to count as members of our conspiracy such luminaries as Socks
Clinton, Bobby Inman, Connie Chung Yu-Hwa (who while mascarading as a
mild-mannered TV anchor is our connection with the Chinese Kuomintang's
massive intelligence apparatus), and the 23 secret leaders of the
Masons.  We've been monitoring your actions for years with bugs,
wiretaps, and secret agents.  One night, while you slept, a crack
surgical terrorist team entered your domicile, sedated you heavily, and
planted radio-controlled electrodes in your head.  Should you ever get a
positive identification on any of the leaders of our cabal, a radio
signal will be sent causing you to go into a massive seizure, whereupon
the elctrodes will disintegrate, leaving no trace of our work for the
forensics experts to sift through.
The situation really is hopless Detweiler.  We can wipe your existence
off the face of the planet any time.  While we figure you're too driven
and fanatical to co-opt, we're happy to fight to a draw.
Congratulate yourself.  Your superior intellect has exposed more about
the inner workings of our organization (and I use the term loosely) than
we expected any mere mortal to be able to manage.  We consider our
protection mechanisms to be strong enough that you won't be able to
cause much damage to our command and control structure.  Relax, take the
day to go hiking in the mountains, enjoy life, and know that your
personal desires and plans are safe from interference for now.

pure text seems to be falling under the tender ministrations of the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
Reports in talk.politics.guns indicate that the Louisville, KY BATF has
informed a non-FFL (i.e., not a gun dealer, thus not under BATF
jurisdiction in the matter) Army-Navy store's proprietor that it would
be "shut down" if he did not remove from sale some Paladin Press titles
on illegal conversion of firearms.
According to followups, it's worse:  The State of Michigan has outlawed

There's been a lot of discussion lately about trying to make stego files
not have any identifying marks, so that usage of stego would be
indistinguishiable from noise.  A more effective option might be to
insert obvious (or somewhat obvious) stego messages in lots of graphics.
 Take every graphic file you own and hide something in it with a stego
program.  Put PGP messages in them (even including the obvious ----
BEGIN PGP MESSAGE ---- headers).  Or a BBS ad.  Or just cute little
messages.  Then distribute the files that way.  Hopefully, people will
take these images and pass them on without ever knowing there was stuff
in them.  If enuff people do this, graphics will become so "polluted"
with stego messages that your truly secret PGP messages will be hidden
in plain sight along with all the other graphic files full of stuff, and
won't stand out.  Plus, you could plausably deny having put it there,
claiming that it must have been that way when you got it, and that you
didn't know it was there.

Just my $0.02...
I recently took a course here at UMBC called Computer Systems Security
taught by a guy who works for NCSC/NSA.  A brief topic of discussion
was PGP.  The guy was really biased against PGP, calling it "illegal",
but he also hinted that it had been broken.  The hint was wrapped within
a "non-denial denial" (for fans of "All The President's Men") and there
was no *concrete* information given to support it.
One conclusion I drew was that:
1) NSA doesn't like PGP *at all*
2) If NSA hasn't broken PGP, they're working hard on breaking it.
One last bit - the guy did admit that PGP would be unbreakable for the
forseeable future if the the key length were increased from a max of 1,024
bits to a max of 2,048 bits.  Doubling key length doesn't double search
time, it's an exponential thing.
Oh yeah, this is really the last bit... living in the same area as NSA, one
hears all kinds of rumors - but one that I've heard numerous times (and
that I give some credence to) is that the NSA measures it's floorspace
dedicated to Crays and other supercomputers in *acres*.  Kind of frightening,
isn't it ?

Yes, you can use the DSS (unless it is given away to PK partners, that is).
The importance of using PGP or another strong privately developed crypto
is that it supports the industry rather than relies upon the government.
But since Mr Godwin has answered the question to his satisfaction and is not
responding to further questions, I guess we will never know the real reason
why the EFF will not use PGP to digitally sign press releases.
Apparently Mr Godwin chooses not to be responsive to the EFF membership with
respect to this issue. He only has said that sysops don't use PGP so rumors
would not be quashed anyway. From a person of his intelligence this is about the lamest reason I've heard.
Let me see if I can speculate on the real reaons the EFF may not choose to use PGP to sign press releases:
(0) Using PGP would be provocative to the very powers we seek to infiltrate
[ViaCrypt PGP is perfectly legal and fully licensed.]
(1) There is not a problem with authenticity.
[This must be false, otherwise Mr Godwin wouldn't have begun this thread]
(2) Signing with PGP is not effective.
[false; MD5 and RSA have no known weaknesses]
(3) Signing with PGP is too hard or would take too much time
[false, perfect for irregular press releases]
(4) PGP signatures take too much bandwidth.
[false, again perfect for the mmoderate to longer press releases]
(5) Sysops don't use PGP, rumors would spread anyway
[Sysops might begin with suitable leadership; the signature of course
could be ignored and the rumor spread anyway -- but if there *were*
a question of authenticity an individual could check the authenticity
without needing to log on to EFF's server or needing to personally contact an EFF official]
(6) Signatures make the press release harder to read
[false, a single line at the beginning and a block of lines at the end
are added, none of the body is changed in any way]
(7) We are journalists and attorneys, not nose-picking nerds
(8) We are journalists and attorneys, this might expose up to greater
liability and less 'deniability'.
(9) We just defend these 'PGP' and 'BBS' people.  We don't actually
want to ASSOCIATE with them more than we have to.  Cooties. (10) The EFF does not have to explain its actions or inactions to anyone.
While Sternlight is merely annoying, and sometimes entertaining, EFFs
lack of dialogue on this leadership opportunity supporting private
crypto signatures is very, very disappointing.

The security of data over networks has risen to debate in Congress.
Does the clipper chip ensure security or violate citizens' rights?
FBI Director Louis Freeh is worried. The bad guys are beginning to see
the light, and it is digital.
Freeh fears some pretty nasty folks have discovered they can commit
highway robbery and more, without even leaving home. Worse, to Freeh
and other top cops, by using some pretty basic technologies, savvy
criminals can do their crimes without worrying about doing time.
Some crooks, spies, drug traffickers, terrorists and frauds already
use the tools of the information age to outfox law enforcement
officers. Hackers use PBXs to hide their tracks as they rip off phone
companies and poke around in other people's files. Reprogrammed
cellular phones give cops fits.
Even simpler technologies can ruin an FBI agent's day. For instance,
last year routine telephone services such as call forwarding thwarted
investigators trying to tap lines 29 times.
To Freeh and other law enforcement officials, things are bound to get
worse. As digital telecommunications technologies and powerful,
portable computers spread, they threaten to undermine the
investigative tools of electronic surveillance that the FBI says have
helped put tens of thousands of criminals behind bars in the past 25
years and saved billions of dollars and thousands of lives, No one
disputes this assessment.
But many Americans consider the Clinton administration's proposed
solutions to be worse than the problems Freeh and other law
enforcement officials confront.
Embodied by the much-maligned Clipper chip key escrow encryption
system and the FBI's Digital Telephony proposal, the solutions put
forward by the Clinton Administration have raised a rare mix of
opponents: Civil libertarians, conservatives, and technology gurus
have all lined up against the government's plans. Some vehemently
oppose these plans as serious threats to individual rights. Others say
they could prove ruinous to a leading U.S. industry at a time when the
worldwide market for telecommunications and computers is growing at an
explosive rate. Underlying all the objections is one common thread.
Do you trust your government?
"Basically, the issue is, 'Do you trust your government?'" observed
David Farber, a telecommunications professional at the University of
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Farber, testifying before a House
subcommittee on the issue last May, said one of his 23-year-old
students replied that to him and others of his generation, the phrase
"trust government" is meaningless.
Lack of trust in government is understandable. After all, those who
are old enough can remember Communist witch hunts in the 1940s and
1950s, the Army's pursuit of anti-Vietnam War activists in the 1960s,
and of course, watergate and the downfall of President Nixon. All
were, to some measure, abuses of the public trust.
Add to that historical conditioning the potent mix of technologies
involved in digital communications systems and cryptography, and its
not hard to open up deep-seated veins of skepticism and mistrust.
In the words of Rep. Dan Glickman, D-KS, today's digital systems are
"scarier" when it comes to wiretapping and other surveillance
capabilities, "because it's kind of inherently in the machinery
itself." Gone are the people -- the linemen, the switchboard
operators, the central office switch personnel -- who might exercise
their judgement and question a request to tap a line or record the
numbers someone dials. Today's chips and switching systems can be
programmed to do it all automatically.
"If they had the right software package," Freeh told one joint House-
Senate subcommittee hearing last March, phone company staff "could be
home sleeping at night and we could have the access we need."
With the right software and hardware combinations and just a few
keystrokes, the government could listen in on just about anyone. In
the digital age, even a computer could do the listening, alerting a
law-enforcement agent only when certain key words or numbers are
uttered. That's exactly what worries civil libertarians such as Jerry
Berman, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and
a spokesman for the public-policy interest group Digital Privacy and
Security Working Group, both based in Washington, D.C.
"In short, the [Digital Telephony] bill lays the groundwork for turning
the National Information Infrastructure into a nationwide surveillance
system, to be used by law enforcement with few technical or legal
safeguards," Berman told the House subcommittee in May. "Although the
FBI suggests that the bill is primarily designed to maintain the
status quo wiretap capability in the face of technological changes, in
fact, it seeks vast new surveillance and monitoring tools."
Strong language, to be sure. But then, the FBI's Digital Telephony
proposal is such strong medicine that some people think it could
poison a critical industry and seriously retard the development of the
national information infrastructure. Similar criticisms have been
leveled against the Clipper chip plan.
"If we are to maintain our leading position in the information
marketplace, we must give our full support to the development of open
international security standards that protect the interests of all
parties fairly," said Whitfield Diffie, one of the inventors of the
public-key encryption concept and now a distinguished engineer with
Sun Microsystems (Mountain View, CA). "A standard based on a secret
American technology and designed to give American intelligence access
to the communications it protects seems an unlikely candidate for
widespread acceptance."
How did we get here? The first formal attempts to address the
challenges posed by digital communications systems began during the
Bush Administration. Meetings between Justice department and telephone
company officials started in 1990 and continued into early 1992, when
a formal industry group, the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry
Solutions (Washington, D.C.), set up its Electronics Communications
Service Providers committee.
But the group holds no authority over the estimated 2,000 providers of
telecommunications services operating in the country. And in any case,
in the view of the FBI, it came up with no workable solutions to the
problems posed by new technology. So, in 1992, the FBI made its first
attempt to push through legislation, meeting with a withering assault
by civil libertarians and industry figures who said it overreaching,
intrusive, and without adequate justification.
A few months after President Clinton took office, he ordered a
National Security Council (NSC) review of the problem. Eight months
later, the NSC panel offered several policy options. "As a result of
their review of the options, it was unanimously decided that
comprehensive legislation was the only effective way to deal with the
digital telephony problem," Freeh testified at the March House-Senate
hearing. The resulting proposal, he added, neither enlarges nor
reduces current authority for government access to communications
content or call setup information, such as numbers dialed or the
locations of phones.
In his written testimony, Freeh went on to sum up the proposal's main
elements: It would require common carriers to supply the capability
and necessary capacity to enable government to conduct lawfully
authorized electronic surveillance. Phone companies would have to
provide assistance for all wiretap, trace, and "pen register" dialing
records "expeditiously and simultaneously," Freeh wrote.
(Law-enforcement officials can obtain a warrant to place a pen
register on a phone line to record what numbers were dialed and from
where they were dialed.) Phone companies would also have to comply
regardless of system features used or the mobility of the target.
Phone companies would also be required to give authorities access in
unobtrusive ways, and be able to supply the content and other
information to remote locations. Failure to comply could result in
fines of up to $10,000 per day.
"The essence of the legislation is to clarify and more fully define
the nature and extent of the service provider's 'assistance'
requirement that was enacted by Congress in 1970, which Congress
imposed so that court orders would not be frustrated due to a
provider's failure to furnish needed technological assistance and
facilities," explained James Kallstrom, special agent in charge of the
FBI's Special Operations division in its New York field office.
Kallstrom, like Freeh and others before him at other hearings,
stressed that failure to adopt the measures sought by the FBI could
expose the nation to the predations of sophisticated criminals.
Rather than pitting government against the First and Fourth Amendment
rights of law-abiding Americans, Kallstrom told a congressional
committee, "I see this as a balance of power between the government
and the criminals."
The cost of compliance
Critics remain unconvinced, however, and not just on civil liberties
While he said the proposal is "overly broad," Ron Neel, president of
the United States Telephone Association (Washington, D.C.), added, it
"does not cover all of the technologies and systems that should be
covered by any rules that are put in place." The USTA is a lobbying
group representing about 1,100 local telephone companies. Ultimately,
Neel told congressional inquisitors, the FBI bill could prompt greater
use of such advanced telecommunications systems as special mobile
radio and personal communications services, which aren't considered
common carriers.
"It makes unreasonable and perhaps impossible demands on those it does
not cover," Neel continued, adding: "It is unnecessarily punitive, and
it is economically unfair and impractical."
To assure access at any given time, all telephone companies will have
to post someone to a law-enforcement liaison role at all times, or risk
a $10,000 a day fine or being shut down entirely, Neel says. The cost
of this and other aspects of the FBI's plan could be staggering.
Just to make sure wiretaps could be placed on calls that are
automatically forwarded to another number could cost $1.8 billion,
Neel says. Others estimate compliance will cost several billion
dollars each year, a cost that Neel says would undoubtedly be passed
on to consumers. While the proposal calls for agencies to compensate
phone companies for their costs, he notes that collection can be
time-consuming, and that, in any case, it is left to the government to
decide how much to pay.
FBI and other administration officials remain unfazed by such
cost-conscious criticisms. "Today will be the cheapest day on which
Congress could fix this thing," Kallstrom said. "Two years from now,
it will be geometrically more expensive."
Freeh contends that the government isn't trying to dictate technical
standards or tell industry what technology to use or to avoid. But,
because of the vagueness of the requirements, Neel and others say the
the proposed law will stifle development of new technology.
"This legislation would make the Attorney General the arbiter of
whatever technologies and equipment can be deployed in the public
telecommunications network," Neel said. "Our nation cannot be held
hostage to inexpert analysis of telecommunications technology as we
move into the information age," he asserted, adding that the FBI
proposal "creates an enormous speed bump in the information
Others outside the industry agree with Neel's assessment. "The Digital
Telephony proposal presents a major drag," said Farber, the Penn
professor. "Whenever a new feature is being considered for
implementation and marketing, one very important issue will be how
much it will cost to implement it."
Farber says compliance could easily cost the industry more than billion a year, and adds the modifications it could require might
disrupt the nation's communications networks. Ultimately, he says the
Digital Telephony and Clipper plans could diminish American
competitiveness in developing markets, such as Eastern Europe or
Southeast Asia. That is a frightening prospect to some in the
industry, and for good reason.
Global telecommunications demand is growing fast, and combined with
the computer and entertainment industries, it is expected to reach
$3.5 trillion by the end of the decade, according to the International
Telecommunications Union. The ITU expects the computer,
communications, and entertainment industries to have merged completely
by then.
"Telecommunications is becoming the world's biggest economic sector,
growing faster than anything else, being the real engine for growth in
almost all economies," said Pekka Tarjanne, the ITU's
secretary-general, at an ITU trade fair in Cairo earlier this year.
"The overall growth rate of the sector is continuing to accelerate in
spite of worldwide recession."
To prevent erosion of America's leading position as a
telecommunications equipment and service provider to the world, Neel
said, "It is extremely important that the public maintain confidence
in the privacy of the telephone system."
Freeh may not want certain types of information, Neel said, but it's
"extremely difficult to ferret out the kind of information he doesn't
want." And in so doing, Neel concluded, "It forces the phone company
to become an agent of law enforcement."
Freeh counters by stressing that the FBI wants only to preserve its
present authority. "Law enforcement is not seeking to build 'back
doors' to sneak into common carrier's systems," Freeh said. "The
proposed legislation is not some dreaded Orwellian prophecy come
Besides, Freeh asserted, telecommunications industry officials "have
bluntly told law enforcement that the existing telecommunications
systems and networks will thwart court-authorized intercepts." Freeh
said in recent years several hundred authorized surveillance efforts
have failed partly or entirely because of "technological impediments."
He said last year alone, 91 intercepts ran into technological
problems, most involving either cellular telephones or call-forwarding
features. But Congress remains unconvinced.
"We are inching closer and closer to 1984, aren't we?" observed Sen.
William S. Cohen, R-ME, during one of the several congressional
hearings. He blamed "increasingly intrusive technology" for this trend.
Yet, he recognized the FBI's need to guard against criminal activity
and terrorist attack. There is a "constant tension" between the need
for privacy and the need for protection, he added.
"We do have some very serious privacy concerns," said Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-VT, the chairman of the Judiciary committee's technology
subcommittee. "That's one of the underlying questions in this whole
It's a matter of privacy
Concerns about privacy and the potential for abuse are not without
foundation, as even some lawmakers can attest. Rep. Don Edwards, D-CA,
chairman of the civil rights subcommittee of the House Judiciary
committee, recalled that in his short service as an FBI agent in the
days before legal authority for wiretaps existed, the agency used the
technology anyway. Today, this kind of abuse is frightening indeed.
Freeh's proposal, Berman said, "will tell you what movies you may be
watching, what newspapers you're reading, what doctor you're seeing...
This is NCIC squared." NCIC is a national computerized criminal
records system operated by the Justice department.
"I don't want anybody to go nose around in all that, anymore than I'd
want somebody to open my mail," Leahy said. But Freeh claimed that
such transactional information is not covered by the proposal, and is
adequately protected under existing laws.
Besides those with concerns about preserving civil liberties, some
members of Congress worry that the FBI proposal and the Clipper chip
plan would put government in a position to shape a huge and rapidly
evolving sector of the nation's economy. Plenty of lawmakers share
Leahy's appreciation of just how technologically backward the
government can be, especially when it comes to computers and
communications systems.
So when Freeh stood in front of lawmakers in a Senate hearing room
last march to say that Americans "want to have a cop" on the digital
information highway, he was met with considerable skepticism.
"I am not prepared to support a government veto on technology
advances," Leahy told Freeh. "I'm frustrated by that idea."  He added,
"If we do that, then you'll find people going to Sweden and Germany to
buy their phone systems, because we'll fall behind."
Noting the government's "outrageous" track record when it comes to
deploying telecommunications and computer technology, Leahy said if
the Justice Department had to sign off on any telecommunications
advances before they could be deployed, "We'd still be back in rotary
He has a point. After all, the White House employed telephone operators
on an old-fashioned switchboard system until last year. And during the
Persian Gulf War, off-the-shelf cellular telephone systems turned out
to work better than expensive military communications gear.
Science and Art
But when it comes to cryptography, the mathematical science of
encoding and decoding, U.S. government employees are among the best in
the world. And many of them work for the Pentagon's National Security
Agency, or NSA, an electronic cloak-and-dagger operation charged with
collecting "signals intelligence" against foreign targets. NSA is also
charged with maintaining computer systems security for the U.S.
government, which is why it designed the key escrow encryption system
of which the Clipper and lesser-known Capstone chips are part.
Unofficially, NSA is thought to have prompted the Clipper plan in
order to head off the commercial success of strong encoding
technologies developed outside the government. That view fits with
NSA's historic role in making available the current widely used
encoding system called Data Encryption Standard, or DES. Under Adm.
Bobby Ray Inman, NSA made DES available for use within the United
States in the 1970's.
Earlier this year, the Clinton administration announced it would
implement the Clipper chip system as a "voluntary" standard suitable
for all non-classified government communications. The action makes it
possible for all government agencies to require the use of
Clipper-enabled communications devices for any sensitive work, either
by staff or outside contractors. With the government's tremendous
buying power, the White House's action could crowd out competing
cryptographic technologies, making Clipper the de facto standard. And
some outside the government ask why is that necessary.
To date, law-enforcement officials have not been "significantly
frustrated by voice encryption," according to Assistant Attorney
General Jo Ann Harris, chief of the Justice department's criminal
division. In pursuing the Clipper plan, she told Sen. Leahy in May, "We
are trying to anticipate, to get ahead of the curve."
Clipper refers to a chip that encodes communications as they pass
through it. It is designed to be embedded in telephones, fax machines,
and modems. While Clipper systems make calls indecipherable to anyone
eavesdropping, the Clipper chip has a "trap door" that the government
can open, giving investigators access to decrypted or "clear" calls.
The key to this door, unique to each chip, would be split into two
pieces and held separately in "escrow" by Treasury and Commerce
department officials.
To many people outside government, Clipper's accessibility, however
closely guarded, opens the door to abuse.
Earlier this year, some 45,000 people signed an electronic petition
against Clipper circulated over the Internet. One oft-cited poll in
March found 80 percent of those asked objected to the Clipper plan.
Still, the White House, led by Vice President Al Gore, plows ahead
with Clipper.
"There is an inherent balancing test which has to be applied," Gore
told a group of reporters in a private meeting in late February. "The
law enforcement and national security interests are of the first order
of magnitude and extremely important." He asserted that Clipper
strikes the right balance between national security interests and the
privacy rights of the individuals and firms.
"We have no intention of supporting some system that will create a de
facto ease of entry into the information superhighway for
law-enforcement officials without proper legal proceedings," Gore
Critics fear that's just what Clipper ultimately will allow.
"Many worry that such an escrow system could be vulnerable to misuse
by a future administration or overzealous law-enforcement
organizations," Farber told the House subcommittee. "The position of
the administration worries many in the technical community, since they
feel it is but the first step to the banning of any form of encryption
except that approved and escrowed by the government."
"The Clinton administration says 'not on our watch,' and I believe
them," Farber added. "However, our grandchildren will not have them on
watch when they grow up. So we need a lasting and effective solution
to this problem, not a quick fix that is technologically unsound and
unwise as a matter of public policy."
Clipper's defenders say it is the fairest, most effective way to
ensure the preservation of the law-enforcement agency's current
authority, while at the same time providing society with a very strong
method of protecting communications. For instance, Clipper is 16
million times harder to break using a "brute force" approach than DES.
Kallstrom, Clipper supporters claim much of the opposition to the plan
stems from misinformation. Opponents say one reason for that is that
much of the Clipper system remains shrouded in secrecy, including the
algorithm, known as Skipjack, used to encrypt communications as they
pass through the Clipper chips.
Dorothy Denning, a cryptographer who heads Georgetown University's
computer science department, was among a handful of outsiders allowed
to examine the classified Skipjack algorithm. After trying to break
it, she and others determined that "there was no significant risk that
Skipjack could be broken by any short-cut method of attack." Moreover,
she testified, it would be 36 years before a brute force approach --
trying every possible combination of keys -- would be economically
But the details of how the escrow bureaucracy would work and how
authorized agents would obtain and use the keys, then destroy them,
have yet to be worked out. At one point, the Justice department's
Harris said she believed the Clipper keys, once issued, would
"self-destruct after a certain period of time."
Opponents remain unconvinced. Some, like University of Pennsylvania's
Farber, suggest placing the keys under the control of nonexecutive
branch agencies, or even in the custody of some private-sector
organization. Clipper is a non-starter as long as the government
controls the keys, say executives in banking, computer services, and
other industries.
Comments by Les Alberthal, chairman and chief executive of General
Motors' EDS (Dallas) unit, reflect the discomfort felt by many
business people when they consider Clipper and its implications.
"I can understand what the government is trying to do," Alberthal
says. "I shudder a little bit at the potential of that sort of
eavesdropping on normal business and normal people's lives.
"We criticized Russia for years for doing that, and yet we're turning
around and trying to do the same thing. Somehow or other, we're going
to have to figure out some process, whereby the illegal kind of
activities, the courts can get at to deal with," Alberthal notes,
adding: "But I do not believe a blanket ability to enter into, watch,
monitor, or pull information out of normal processes or business
cycles is really going to work."
An American disadvantage
While the U.S. government meddles with the market for encryption,
causing major purchasers to delay acquisitions, it gives foreign
competitive advantages over its suppliers, in the view of Martin
Hellman, a Stanford University electrical engineering professor who
studied the issue for the Business Software Alliance (Washington,
D.C.). Government meddling risks slowing the development of America's
information structure, he adds, pointing out that it may also lead to
the creation of incompatible infrastructures in other parts of the
world, where encryption technology is not restricted.
Hellman and others say that for any network to gain widespread
acceptance as a medium for commerce, it must be trusted to deliver
communications with absolute privacy and integrity. "Just as people do
not use post cards for most of their mail, prudent users will refuse
to trust most information to an insecure NII," Hellman writes in a
study of the issue. Absent that level of security, the American
information superhighway could become a monumental white elephant.
"Local area networks are, in reality, spy networks in which each node
watches all the information flowing over the shared cable and picks
out only those messages with its address. It would take only a minor
modification to create phantom nodes that watch all information
flowing over the cable and pick out only those intended for someone
else on the network," Hellman writes. "Because such phantom nodes look
like normal nodes, it would be hard to detect their existence."
E-mail messages, for instance, often pass through "supernodes" en
route to their final destination, and thus could easily be picked off
and copied or altered along the way, hellman notes. He says the NSA,
aware of the potential problems this could cause, "prohibits its own
confidential information from being sent over the Internet. Instead,
the agency uses its own secure e-mail network and is extremely careful
to prevent any connection between the two."
Additionally, Hellman observes that America's allies -- as well as its
old opponents -- continue to pry into the affairs of U.S. businesses,
particularly those with proprietary technology. Government officials
in the U.S. and Canada have testified recently concerning the
activities of French, Japanese, Chinese, and Russian services spying
on U.S. corporations. So those that operate without the benefit of
data encryption and other security measures are at risk.
Reluctant acceptance
Data security and integrity is a vital issue to many people in
business. One survey, conducted among Fortune 500 companies by Forest
& Sullivan last year, found 92 percent of the 151 respondents felt
information security was important. Data encryption was counted as an
important tool to that end by 46 percent. Datapro, a McGraw Hill
research unit based in Delran, NJ, found that 29 percent of the 1,153
respondents in a 1992 survey used end-to-end encryption systems to
guard their communications.
Yet for all that interest, AT&T, the only maker of Clipper telephone
systems, counts the FBI as its biggest customer. Earlier this year,
the agency ordered 9,000 of the Clipper units, which retail at a cost
of $1,090 each.
Stephen Walker, founder and president of Trusted Information Systems
(Glenwood, MD), a long-time NSA cryptographer, argues that the Clipper
plan is hopelessly flawed from an economic standpoint. Citing market
estimates that there are 250,000 voice encryption systems in use
today, Walker told a Senate hearing that the $14 million Clipper setup
costs and its $16 million annual budget would mean that the cost of
intercepting Clipper encrypted calls could run as high as $6.4 million
each, given that only an estimated 2.5 Clipper-encoded calls would be
intercepted each year.
He derived those numbers based on the estimated 500 million phones in
use in the United States, the number of wiretaps likely in a year
(5,000), and the statistical likelihood that a target line would be
encrypted, assuming that all encryption would be with Clipper systems.
Besides those impractical economics, Walker points out that by
doubling up DES encryption -- running a communication through two
different devices -- someone who wants to frustrate a wiretap could
have a code that is stronger than Clipper, and for which there would
be no escrowed key. Besides, he and others note, there are literally
hundreds of other encryption systems available today, including many
that use DES and some that use "public key" methods that make encoded
electronic mail unbreakable.
Based on his analysis, Walker added, "I'm convinced that five years
from now they'll say 'This isn't working,' so we'll have to change
the rules." Then, he predicted, Clipper will be made mandatory for all
encoded communications.
One way in which Clipper could be made acceptable, Walker says, is to
make the judiciary system act as the escrow agent. That way it would
at least be independent of the executive branch, and would reinforce
the traditional American method of balancing governmental power among
its different branches.
But Diffie, the Sun engineer, contended that any escrowed system is
hopelessly flawed when it comes to communications encryption security.
Good security practice in communications, he observed, means keeping
the decoded keys around far as short a time as necessary, then
destroying them. Today, secure phones use keys that exist only for as
long as a single encrypted call lasts, and once destroyed can never be
recreated. "A key escrow proposal surrenders this advantage," he said,
"by creating a new set of escrowed keys that are stored indefinitely
and can always be used to read earlier traffic."
Stored data that is encrypted is useless without a key, Diffie
noted. For that reason, the user has to keep a copy of the key
somewhere, and that makes it obtainable by traditional methods like
those that are used to retrieve paper records today.
Finally, Diffie noted, "The reason there is so much disagreement is
that there is so little evidence of a problem." No one has claimed,
after all, that the bad guys are using voice encryption technology
today. Even master spy Aldrich Ames, the renegade CIA officer
turned Soviet mole, used clear lines to plot his misdeeds.
With the rapid advances in computing and communications technologies,
Diffie asserted, "If allowing or even encouraging wide dissemination
of high-grade cryptography proves to be a mistake, it is likely to be
a correctable mistake."
"If, on the other hand, we set the precedent of building government
surveillance capabilities into our security equipment, we risk
entrenching a bureaucracy that will not easily surrender that power
this gives."

Well, keeping in the spirit of the original message, I will reply
to it anonymously. Besides, what I am going to say probably won't
be popular.
Did anyone else shudder when they read this? All I can say is that I am
*glad* this person does not run a remailer (although, if I were really paranoid, I might speculate that he does!).
As Tim May and Carl Kadie have pointed out on numerous occasions,
by systematically filtering mail the operator tends to lose the protection
of the legal status of "common carrier". I don't know if a remailer operator would be classified as such but others have proposed that
But just from a philosophical view, I think any remailer operators
hunting for Detweiler-grams in all their incoming mail are employing
a procedure that is antithetical to their entire commitment. Isn't
it just a *teensy* bit hypocritical? Is this how you are going to build
cyberspatial-wide confidence in the use of your remailers for their
dependability and secrecy? Isn't it just a *teensy* bit hypocritical
to yell to the world that ANONYMITY IS THE RIGHT OF MAN and have a little
whisper in small print, "unless you are an official enemy of the Is it just me, or is this Detweiler thing blown *way* out of proportion?
He seems like a harmless crackpot occupying himself by banging on a keyboard. In fact, being consistently at the tmp even helps to filter him.
Cypherpunks, we believe in the philosophy that we are being oppressed
by numerous forces that seek to deprive us of our privacy-- big business,
the government, police, etc. But how can we claim to uphold the philosophy
of freedom of speech and privacy looking at our relationship with Detweiler?
Sometimes I think he was sent by God to test us.
What is it in the human psyche, rooted deep in our subconscious, that pushes us to *vengeance* against those who offend us? That pushes us to
want to *expose* them (as the person said above, "EXPOSE THE BASTARD!!!").
Do we have any consistent beliefs? How is that we, who are dedicated
to privacy, broadcast to everyone listening in a clear voice, that
"freedom of speech does not belong to people who offend us"? There is
a saying, "who will guard the guardians themselves"? Who will ensure
that those who advocate anonymity actually follow through, if they don't?
I personally advocate that the Detweiler-Detritus be allowed through
the remailers unaltered as a blaring advertisement to the entire world
of cyberspace that yes, we believe that anonymity is *sacred*, even more
so than we believe that Detweiler is the AntiChrist of the Cypherpunks.
"I detest what you say, but I will defend to my death your right to
say it." --Voltaire
"Freedom of speech does not end at the point that it offends; to the
contrary, that is where it begins" --Supreme Court justice (paraphrase)
That's all I have to say.

         Proposed Modification of the Secure Hash Algorithm
In Section 7 of [1](page 9), the line which reads
    b) For t=16 to 79 let W(t) = W(t-3) XOR W(t-8) XOR W(t-14) XOR W(t-16).
is to be replaced by
    b) For t=16 to 79 let
                   W(t) = S1( W(t-3) XOR W(t-8) XOR W(t-14) XOR W(t-16) ).
where S1 is a left circular shift by one bit as defined
in Section 3 of [1](page 6), namely
S1(X) = (X<<1) V (X>>31).
ASCII translator's note : S1 is actually,  S superscript 1.
                          W(t-n) is actually, W subscript, t or t-n.

That's the easiest part. International competition for the precious
few organizations requiring launching facilities has almost entirely
elimintated government intervention in what goes up. Its just like
dealing with regulations made by physical world entities in cyberspace.
If you don't like the rules, it is easy to move it elsewhere.
All we need is widely distributed software with optional escrow and the
government will be helpless against us. They won't have a prayer of passing
legislation that prevents you from using your software, so they'll pass
legislation that requires you to use escrows. People will register a key with
the escrow and then use a different key for everything. Escrow dies. Of
course we should fight anything mandating escrow, but the reality is that
if we can force the escrow into software it will be useless to big brother.

@_subject: Re: Why emoney?  Why not a web of debt? 
By only trading with trusted partners.  Read on...
  If the remailer operator trusts Carol, then Carol and the Op can
exchange Op-IOU's for money, or Carol-IOU's for Op-IOU's.  (This is
the base case of the induction for you math geeks.)  Carol can use the
Op-IOU's directly with the Op or 'sell' them to people who want to do
business with the Op.
  If the remailer operator doesn't trust Carol, but there is a chain
of trust from Carol to the remailer operator, then Carol can get IOUs
from someone which the remailer operator does trust.  Call them
Jo-IOUs.  To do this Carol asks Pat who asks ... who asks Jo for an
IOU worth $32.  Carol gives Pat a Carol-IOU worth $32(+transaction fee
is Pat is a greedy sole) in exchange for which Pat gives Carol the
Jo-IOU worth $32 (which Carol got from Pat (which Pat got from some
place only Pat knows for sure)).
  IOU swaps will probably be done under the cover of encryption.
Swaps can also be done with a nice ecash system like Chaum and
Brandt(sp?) have proposed.  But I am not sure it is required.
  Anonymity can come also from the chain of IOU swaps, in the same way
remailers produce anonymity -- each person neglects to tell any others
for whom they carry out IOU swaps.  Sure Pat knows Carol wants a Jo
IOU, but Pat doesn't know why.  Jo could figure out that Jo's IOU went
out to W.Smith, and came back from V.Jones but can't make any
conclusion about weather W. and V. are trading partners or not.  It
would take a conspiracy of each person along the swap path to expose
the real trade.  Alternatively the buyer or seller can out the
transaction.  (But suppose they only know each other via some
anonymous email pool...)
  And privacy (from other than your trading partners) comes from using
encryption during each IOU swap.
  But if you don't trust your trading partners enough to keep quiet
about who you are, by all means use an untraceable ecash system.
(There are other advantages to using blind signatures anyway.)
  Well...  TackyTokens, and a little bit (ha!) of client code (start
with Sameer's?) ought to do the trick.  (So perhaps the original
message's subject ought to have been "Why Ebanks?  Why not a web of
debt-trust?" since it is the central bank I am avoiding here.  Not
tacky tokens.)
  But it isn't really necesary.  Read on...
  One problem with getting an ecash system off the ground is making
the tokens worth moeny.  The advantage of a distributed web-of-
debt/trust model is that I only need to trade IOUs for US$ with a few
trusted friends.  I don't need to go to any kind of central bank.  No
central bank means no central point to be attacked with guns, hacks,
or taxes.  No central bank means no credit card numbers, money orders,
or green backs mailed away to strangers.
  Another cool thing, and the reason you don't need Chaumian digital
cash, is that the only people you can steal from (or who can steal
from you) are your trusted friends!  If I pass a bogus token in
exchange for a real IOU, then I just ripped off my friend.  The only
place two non-friends interface is at the final buyer-seller
interface.  If the seller refuses to honor the token, the buyer can
ask the friend who gave it to them for a refund, who can ask for a
refund from ... until the token gets back to the thief.  The thief can
either steal from their friend by refusing the refund, or infact honor
the bogus token, and eat the loss (if any).
  One bad thing is anyone can deny service to people by passing bogus
tokens, and then refunding them.  Lukily the friends of the blocker
will notice that when getting tokens through that person, the number
of refunds is higher than average.  In that case, the blocker can be
removed from lists of their friends, and cut out of the economy.
  Denial of service can be prevented another way too -- but it does
require Chaumian blind signatures.  Instead of trading a Carol-IOU for
any old Jo-IOU, Carol might demand a Jo-IOU which is a signature on a
particular (blinded) secret number.  Just as if Carol were doing a
TackyToken protocol exchange directly with Jo.  If Carol gets a thing
from Pat which isn't signed by Jo, Carol complains to Pat.  If Carol
gets a thing which un-blinded isn't a signature by Jo of Carol's
secret number, Carol again complains to Pat.  Symbolically: instead of
a <-> b, then b <-> c, then ... y <-> z; do a -> via b -> via c
... via y -> z signs -> via y ... via b -> to a.  The disadvantage is
that Pr0duct Cypher's Tacky Token code would need to be hacked a bit
more.  And then there is the nasty old issue of algorithm patents.

: Subject: IP Spoofing Attacks and Hijacked Terminal Connections
: Date: Mon Jan 23 16:00:37 1995
: =============================================================================
: CA-95:01                         CERT Advisory
:                                 January 23, 1995
:                 IP Spoofing Attacks and Hijacked Terminal Connections
: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
: The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of attacks in which
: intruders create packets with spoofed source IP addresses. These attacks
: exploit applications that use authentication based on IP addresses. This
: exploitation leads to user and possibly root access on the targeted system.
: Note that this attack does not involve source routing. Recommended solutions
: are described in Section III below.
: In the current attack pattern, intruders may dynamically modify the kernel of
: a Sun 4.1.X system once root access is attained.  In this attack, which is
: separate from the IP spoofing attack, intruders use a tool to take control of
: any open terminal or login session from users on the system. Note that
: although the tool is currently being used primarily on SunOS 4.1.x systems,
: the system features that make this attack possible are not unique to SunOS.
:  : As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we will place
: it, along with any clarifications, in a CA-95:01.README file. CERT advisories
: and their associated README files are available by anonymous FTP from
: info.cert.org. We encourage you to check the README files regularly for
: updates on advisories that relate to your site.
:  : -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
:  : I.   Description
:  :      This description summarizes both the IP spoofing technique that can
:      lead to root access on a system and the tool that intruders are using to
:      take over open terminal and login connections after they get root access.
:      We are currently seeing attacks in which intruders combine IP spoofing
:      with use of the tool. However, these are two separate actions. Intruders
:      can use IP spoofing to gain root access for any purpose; similarly, they
:      can highjack terminal connections regardless of their method of gaining
:      root access.
:  :      IP spoofing
:         To gain access, intruders create packets with spoofed source IP
:         addresses. This exploits applications that use authentication
: based on
:         IP addresses and leads to unauthorized user and possibly root access
:         on the targeted system. It is possible to route packets through
:         filtering-router firewalls if they are not configured to filter
:         incoming packets whose source address is in the local domain. It
:         is important to note that the described attack is possible even if
:         no reply packets can reach the attacker.
:  :         Examples of configurations that are potentially vulnerable include
:         - routers to external networks that support multiple internal
:           interfaces
:         - routers with two interfaces that support subnetting on the
:           internal network
:         - proxy firewalls where the proxy applications use the source
:           IP address for authentication
:  :         The IP spoofing attacks we are currently seeing are similar to those
:         described in two papers: 1) "Security Problems in the TCP/IP Protocol
:         Suite" by Steve Bellovin, published in _Computer Communication Review_
:         vol. 19, no. 2 (April 1989) pages 32-48; 2) "A Weakness in the 4.2BSD
:         Unix TCP/IP Software" by Robert T. Morris. Both papers are available
:         by anonymous FTP from
:  :            ftp.research.att.com:/dist/internet_security
:  :            Bellovin paper: ipext.ps.Z
:            Morris paper:   117.ps.Z
:  :         Services that are vulnerable to the IP spoofing attack include
:            SunRPC & NFS
:            BSD UNIX "r" commands
:            anything wrapped by the tcp daemon wrappers - site dependent; check
:                your configuration
:            X windows
:            other applications that use source IP addresses for authentication
:  :      Hijacking tool
:         Once the intruders have root access on a system, they can use a tool
:         to dynamically modify the UNIX kernel. This modification allows them
:         to hijack existing terminal and login connections from any user on the
:         system.
:  :         In taking over the existing connections, intruders can bypass one-time
:         passwords and other strong authentication schemes by tapping the
:         connection after the authentication is complete. For example, a
:         legitimate user connects to a remote site through a login or terminal
:         session; the intruder hijacks the connection after the user has
:         completed the authentication to the remote location; the remote site
:         is now compromised. (See Section I for examples of vulnerable
:         configurations.)
:  :         Currently, the tool is used primarily on SunOS 4.1.x systems. However,
:         the system features that make this attack possible are not unique to
:         SunOS.
:  :  : II. Impact
:  :      Current intruder activity in spoofing source IP addresses can lead to
:      unauthorized remote root access to systems behind a filtering-router
:      firewall.
:  :      After gaining root access and taking over existing terminal and login
:      connections, intruders can gain access to remote hosts.
:  :  : III. Solutions
:  :      A. Detection
:  :         IP spoofing
:            If you monitor packets using network-monitoring software such as
:            netlog, look for a packet on your external interface that has
:            both its source and destination IP addresses in your local domain.
:            If you find one, you are currently under attack. Netlog is
:            available by anonymous FTP from
:               net.tamu.edu:/pub/security/TAMU/netlog-1.2.tar.gz
:               MD5 checksum: 1dd62e7e96192456e8c75047c38e994b
:  :            Another way to detect IP spoofing is to compare the process
:            accounting logs between systems on your internal network. If
:            the IP spoofing attack has succeeded on one of your systems,
:            you may get a log entry on the victim machine showing a remote
:            access; on the apparent source machine, there will be no
:            corresponding entry for initiating that remote access.
:  :         Hijacking tool
:            When the intruder attaches to an existing terminal or login
:            connection, users may detect unusual activity, such as commands
:            appearing on their terminal that they did not type or a blank
: window
:            that will no longer respond to their commands. Encourage your users
:            to inform you of any such activity. In addition, pay particular
:            attention to connections that have been idle for a long time.
:  :            Once the attack is completed, it is difficult to detect. However,
:            the intruders may leave remnants of their tools. For example, you
:            may find a kernel streams module designed to tap into existing TCP
:            connections.
:  :      B. Prevention
:  :         IP spoofing
:            The best method of preventing the IP spoofing problem is to install
:            a filtering router that restricts the input to your external
:            interface (known as an input filter) by not allowing a packet
:            through if it has a source address from your internal network. In
:            addition, you should filter outgoing packets that have a source
:            address different from your internal network in order to prevent
:            a source IP spoofing attack originating from your site.
:  :            The following vendors have reported support for this feature:
:              Bay Networks/Wellfleet routers, version 5 and later
:              Cabletron - LAN Secure
:              Cisco - RIS software all releases of version 9.21 and later
:              Livingston - all versions
:  :            If you need more information about your router or about firewalls,
:            please contact your vendor directly.
:  :            If your vendor's router does not support filtering on the inbound
:            side of the interface or if there will be a delay in incorporating
:            the feature into your system, you may filter the spoofed IP packets
:            by using a second router between your external interface and your
:            outside connection. Configure this router to block, on the outgoing
:            interface connected to your original router, all packets that
: have a
:            source address in your internal network. For this purpose, you can
:            use a filtering router or a UNIX system with two interfaces that
:            supports packet filtering.
:  :            NOTE: Disabling source routing at the router does not protect you
:                  from this attack, but it is still good security practice to
:                  do so.
:  :         Hijacking tool
:            There is no specific way to prevent use of the tool other than
:            preventing intruders from gaining root access in the first place.
:            If you have experienced a root compromise, see Section C for
: general
:            instructions on how to recover.
:  :      C. Recovery from a UNIX root compromise
:  :         1. Disconnect from the network or operate the system in
:            single-user mode during the recovery.  This will keep users
:            and intruders from accessing the system.
:  :         2. Verify system binaries and configuration files against the
:            vendor's media (do not rely on timestamp information to
:            provide an indication of modification).  Do not trust any
:            verification tool such as cmp(1) located on the compromised
:            system as it, too, may have been modified by the intruder.
:            In addition, do not trust the results of the standard UNIX
:            sum(1) program as we have seen intruders modify system
:            files in such a way that the checksums remain the same.
:            Replace any modified files from the vendor's media, not
:            from backups.
:                                 -- or --
:  :            Reload your system from the vendor's media.
:  :         3. Search the system for new or modified setuid root files.
:  :                 find / -user root -perm -4000 -print
:  :            If you are using NFS or AFS file systems, use ncheck to
:            search the local file systems.
:  :                 ncheck -s /dev/sd0a
:  :         4. Change the password on all accounts.
:  :         5. Don't trust your backups for reloading any file used by
:            root.  You do not want to re-introduce files altered by an
:            intruder.

I wonder if 'Net-cash' is any good?  Try sending e-mail to
with the words netbank-intro on the first line of body.
It says:
        The NetBank ...is based on "payment coupons" that may be traded
        via electronic mail ... NetCash is easily obtained by using the
        NetBank's "Check Cashing by FAX" service.  Customers may
        purchase NetCash by writing a personal check and faxing it to
        the NetCash Distribution Center.  Travelers on the Infobahn may
        carry NetCash and cash checks while online.
and lots more. Does not look too anymous, however, and there is no
mention of PGP in the documents I got.  But do check it out.
When you get the info, they give you 5 cents worth of NetCash, BTW.
They also have other stuff:

will someone just CUT THE @ FOSTER CONSPIRACY THEORIES??
I'm getting F---ING SICK AND TIRED of all the BULL**** that
is being posted to this F---ING LIST!!!! does anyone give
a flying f--- whether Foster was killed or suicided or
hit by a bus?!?!?! WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH CYPHERPUNKS?
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH CODE???
PARRY IS RIGHT. everyone else who disagrees can KISS MY ASS.
sign up for the PLAN TO ENCRYPT CYBERSPACE. parry is the man
to start with. he will get you started on his campaign like
any good drill instructer. oh yes, so many of you pansies
need to get into a serious digital BOOT camp. learn some real
manly things for a change!!!  besides gossiping and tittering
like grizzled grandmothers who haven't a clue or a life!!!
he's right, little TIMMY MAY
hasn't done one @ productive thing in the last 5 years
after he quit Intel. oh yeah, he is raking in cash off all
his little darling stocks, but what the hell does he have
to say that is even slightly relevant to coding? my god,
here is a guy that barely even knows what linux IS, let alone
how to install it. I bet he thinks that "bash" is something
you do to the NSA!!! oh yeah, he goes to his silly little
"mind masturbating and drug fondling" parties every few
days with all the Hoi Poilloi Holier-Than-Thou pricks of
the world, the "cum of the net" ejaculating all over each
other, hehehehehehe what a bunch of effeminate nobodies...
PARRY is the premiere cypherpunk. he should be worshipped
by everyone. he has written dozens of RFCS which have made
cyberspace a far better place as we know it. if you don't
contribute to his solution, YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM.
PARRY is part of the solution. HINT FOR THE CLUELESS: GET WITH THE PROGRAM. don't you think that you are being
the most scurrilous swine for taking up PARRY's time with
your filling up this mailing list with GARBAGE? TRASH?
EXCREMENT? ODIOUS EFFLUVIA??? don't you know that it cuts
into his insanely precious programming time by hours to have
to monitor this list closely to see if anyone posted some
boneheaded conspiracy theory or insulted him??? that
TAKES PRECIOUS TIME THAT HE COULD BE SPENDING TRADING
PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES WITH BRILLIANT PEOPLE WHO KNOW
UNIX SOFTWARE AND HOW TO WRITE A CORRECT DNS LOOKUP VIA
SOCKET LIBRARIES. are we cypherpunks, or cypherprogrammers?
GET A CLUE, PEOPLE.
I SWEAR if I see one more FORWARDED ARTICLE TO THIS GROUP,
I'M GOING TO MAILBOMB THE WHOLE LIST. that'll teach the
@ bastards to mess with MY VALUABLE TIME.

@_subject: premail www interface 
I have worked the kinks out and now announce the premail www interface.
The interface uses preamil to send you mail anonymously  without fuss or
muss.  If you are not familiar with premail, check the page out and see
what is all about.  You can find the premail script on Raph's pinging
The interface should be bug free, but if you find any, let me know.  I
welcome comments/flames/criticisms.  If there are suggestions for upgrades
or future ideas, let me know.
The cpremailer that I have up is still there.  These two www interfaces
should serve many people well.  The suggestions  I received for the cpremailer have been implemented so that you, the user, selects the number
of remailers to use.  No more hardwiring and there is nothing that forces
you to chain.
   <-premail interface
  <-  nate's www remailer
If anyone has designed a similar remailer interface for premail, let me
know. I would like to know how you did it differently. Of course this email is coming to you from the premail gate.

.SIG HEILARCHY REVEALED
"Cluttering up the namespace" is a growing problem. Fortunately, the InterNIC has taken on the important task of registering pseudonyms, and will coordinate the issuance of new pseudonyms with the Postal Service.
[The issuance of these items is temporarily on hold due to the Government Shutdown (tm).]
The fee for this will likely be quite reasonable, in the $300/year range, consistent with SAIC's plans for other emerging markets.
The InterNIC also sees great promise in collecting fees for .sig blocks, tentatively priced at $10 per line per year. As SAIC Chairman Bobby Ray Inman points out, this is the easiest way to control the proliferation of long .sig blocks.

Is this list archived so that I can try to look stuff up before asking stupid questions?

The recent flap over Netscape and GAK ought to serve as a wakeup call and
a reminder of the advantages the anarchstic GNU/FSF paradigm of software development has over the corporate model.
No one can control GNU code, and no entity can impose changes on everyone
else.  If everyone was using GNU browsers and ssl servers right now we'd
be safe.
Competing with Netscape is obviously something that's easier said than
done.  But we ought to consider the strategic importance of having robust,
free, open source packages for security applications, even if affordable
and high quality commercial products exist.

Your message here.
Dirty, Rotten E-Mail Liar Accuses
 Apple of Being Worth a Lot More
 By JIM CARLTON
 Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal  To Apple Computer Inc.'s litany of woes, add a mad e-mailer.  The e-mailer struck this week with a copy of a bogus message
 from Sony Corp.'s president threatening a hostile takeover of the
 Cupertino, Calif., computer maker. The "letter" showed up in e-mail
 baskets of computers throughout Silicon Valley and beyond.  Managers at Apple read the letter with great interest -- until they
 got to the part about Sony offering $63 a share, or roughly double
 Apple's stock value.  Now Silicon Valley is abuzz about who the mad e-mailer is. Sony
 has launched an investigation, promising to explore "the availability
 of appropriate legal action against those responsible."  At first glance, the letter appears to be worded authentically
 enough. Addressed to Apple CEO Michael Spindler from
 Nobuyuki Idei, it says Sony intends to buy all of Apple's shares for
 $7.74 billion after a breakdown in merger talks that were
 supposedly taking place between the two companies. "We believe
 this is the fastest, most efficient way to bring our companies
 together," Mr. Idei purportedly says.  But at Apple, executives quickly dismissed the letter as a prank.
 For one thing, the Apple e-mail address was for a "c.franz," a
 person unknown to the company. The letter also misidentified Mr.
 Idei as Sony's chairman and CEO. And initial notification of such a
 takeover bid is almost never made by letter, for secrecy reasons.  So just who is the mad e-mailer? The return address was left
 blank, and a list of suspects could prove endless. A disgruntled
 employee is one possibility. Scads of Apple managers have
 departed in recent months. Or, analysts say, it could be a cheap
 shot by an employee at an Apple competitor. Whoever the culprit
 is, "this sounds like a real attempt to tick somebody off," says Mark
 Macgillivray, an industry consultant in Sunnyvale, Calif.  The e-mail letter was circulating as Apple was announcing an
 estimated loss of $68 million and plans for a restructuring that
 analysts expect to include massive layoffs. Since Apple has long
 been rumored to be a takeover target, the letter added to the angst
 in Cupertino.  In a reflection of morale at Apple, some engineers are joking
 they're disappointed the letter was phony. They would have liked
 Apple to accept the offer.
