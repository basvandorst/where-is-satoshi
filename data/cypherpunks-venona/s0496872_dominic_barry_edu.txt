@_subject: PGP FAQ 
Could someone here politely send me some email on where i could get an updated
PGP FAQ?  I have an old one for v2.3a.  I'd like to get an updated one.
But where the old one says to go, the directory no longer exists.

@_subject: Wiping swapfile 
Could someone email me or post to the list where i could get utilities to
wipe my windows swapfile so my PGP pass phrase is not stored in it.
I know such utilities exist, but i don't know where to find them.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
