: How about suggesting a make variable HAS_LIBCRYPT to the FreeBSD people?
: We could set it in  or something like this (to a value
: meaning "we don't have it and we don't need it either), and FreeBSD could
: do similar.
The problem isn't in the BSD make files, but rather in the makefiles
of the ports.  True, many FreeBSD ports' patches add -lcrypt blindly
to the makefile, but that could change.
: Another way were patching the third party program's Makefile accordingly.
: We should introduce a patches-${OPSYS} directory having precedence before
: the patches directory of a port. Thus we could maintain our special patches
: for ports which need them while continuing to use the FreeBSD ports where
: they work out of the box. I see now that this is already implemented in
: , so we could just USE that.
There already is the patches-${OPSYS} that can be used for this

: I've already made a similar message to the ports list.  It was shot down.
: But maybe now that we see the "trouble" with the current setup, we can
: re-evaluate that.  Personally, I think we could share 95% of the ports
: stuff between open/freebsd, but it would be nice to have the ability to
: fix things in a local cvs tree, without having to wait for the fix to go
: through channels.
I would like to support this 100%.  This would also help with the
-lcrypt problem, et al.
Recall that bsd.port.mk already supports this.  We can start doing it
right away...
