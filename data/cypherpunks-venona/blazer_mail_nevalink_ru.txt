@_subject: Newbie pgp question 
Hi guys,
I've got a question - may be it is FAQ, the please point me.
I need - well, it sounds funny - to crack PGP-encrypted text ;)
I have secring.pgp but not the keyphrase - does it make things easier or
I also have pgpcrack99.zip (DOS-version, zip means that I unzipped it
for the 1st time :)  But I guess it will take megahours with big
dictionary - and it will cover only single words, not sentences.
Please, can somebody introduce me a little?
PS. I also know few words in that file, may be even phrases.

Thanks Bill for very good explanation.
O-o! You are well informed in what is going on! The "guy" is in fact
pretty girl - one man's secretary, so those methods are not for this
case. But may be I'd better brute force her instead of her secring? :)

Guys, what are you talking about? Just go through any proxy that ends
with .us or .net or .com (or Anonymizer) and give any e-mail address
from hotmail or yahoo.com or anything else - and MIT pgp will be yours
in few minutes.
If this means "restrictions" I'm sorry ;)
