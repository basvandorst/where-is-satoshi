The Secret Service is a division of the Treasury Department.  One of their
main duties is tracking down counterfeiters.  If someone has stolen a color
copy machine, there's a very good chance that it was stolen for the end
purpose of counterfeiting.  So I would imagine that that would be why the
SS would be looking for this particular stolen property.  Make sense?

What if the only biometric scans taken of a person were taken while
flushing on niacin?  Will they result in a consistent, though flushed,
scan, thereby enabling the stystem to identify you anyway?  If they then
nab you and want to verify the scan, all they have to do is inject you with
another dose of niacin and check the scan.  [Obviously this scenario
assumes some fairly major civil rights violations, but for the
international traveler....]

The Japanese Yen is not a representation of a dollar but it is convertable
into dollars.  I think what was originally meant was whether the digital
cash will be in units equivalent to dollars and readily "convertable" into
dollars in the same sense that dollar bills were at one time readily
convertable into the amount of gold that they "represented."  Anyway, that
was my understanding of the question.

While am in agreement with your sentiments, the fact remains that
governments certainly are attempting to assert their dominion over portions
of cyberspace.  Are these the final death throes of a doomed species, with
corporations and loose confederations of hackers destined to take their
places, or will this be part of the justification for a one-world

The question as to what they are "supposed" to do can be understood in two
ways:  (1) what does the law ALLOW them to do, versus (2) what are they
likely to do anyway?  If the question is understood to be (2) above, then I
would agree with Unicorn.  But if the question is understood to be (1)
above, then inquiry must be made as to (a) whether there is a warrant, and
if so then (b) what are the terms of the warrant.  If there is no warrant,
then of course they should tuck tail and run.  If there is a warrant, then
upon confrontation the person who is the object of the warrant should be
permitted to read it.  Maybe the warrant is only to permit tapping of the
phone.  Maybe the warrant is only to seize certain equipment.  At this
point, you should shut up (don't say ANYTHING AT ALL) and call your lawyer.
 If things have gotten this far along, you're no longer in control of the
situation and the best thing you can do is hope the feds screw up somehow. Oh, by the way, when you're talking to your lawyer  on the phone, don't say
anything stupid.  Don't admit anything.  Just explain the situation and
tell him to come over right away.  And in the meantime, just stay quiet!

Once again citizen.unit.miller is getting out of hand.  You have been
warned about allowing these subversive postings of his [see below] to reach
the Net.  Having failed in your primary duty, you are hereby instructed to
encourage the creation of the referenced message base.  Once this is
accomplished, these subversive elements will have unwittingly established
(1) a method whereby we can more closely monitor the level of their
knowledge; (2) a method whereby we can measure information dispersal rates;
and (3) a convenient source for the infusion of disinformation.  You know what to do.

But wait!  How do we know he's telling us the truth when he says he's
allowed to lie?  I mean, if he's telling the truth, then he might be lying,
and if he's lying then either he's not allowed to lie or the courts have
not confirmed this "right."  On the other hand, if he's lying, then he
might be telling the truth --- Aw, shit.  You can't even trust the FBI
anymore!  ;)

Don't try to be clever when you're talking with the Feds.  Your best bet is
simply to demand a lawyer and then shut up.
